gov gaston caperton presented striking 
teachers tuesday night with a sevenpoint plan that promises no pay 
raises but calls for a special legislative session if theres 
enough surplus money to fund a salary increase 
caperton also offered to call an education summit in may to 
seek longterm solutions to the annual problem of teacher pay 
teacher union representatives left the governors office without 
comment about 1045 pm tuesday following a second day of talks 
gubernatorial spokesman gc morse said the administration 
expects an answer from the west virginia education association and 
the west virginia federation of teachers by noon wednesday 
the immediate reaction from these folks was favorable but 
these folks need to get back and confer with whoever they confer 
with morse said 
the governor announced his offer in a statement at 11 pm 
tuesday he took no questions from reporters 
on march 5 when the legislature was still in session the 
governor and legislative leaders offered the teachers a 5 percent 
pay raise financed by a tax increase for coal producers but that 
deal collapsed the next day 
caperton said tuesday night that he would not propose a tax 
increase again because the public wouldnt support it 
west virginia simply cannot afford to do more caperton 
said no matter how jusitifed their position may be on the matter 
of teacher compensation i bear a responsibility to the taxpayers 
of west virginia 
more than 85 percent of west virginias 22000 public 
schoolteachers walked out in the states first such strike last 
wednesday in a dispute over wages and benefits by tuesday the 
strike had spread to 46 of the states 55 counties 
the wvea claims 16000 members statewide and the wvft had 
3000 including teachers and other school employees 
in addition to the special session proposal and the education 
summit the governors proposal includes 
an offer to work with teacher representatives to come up with 
legislative proposals 
3 million from a school computer program to be diverted to 
teacher pay 
a promise to continue to work for equity funding aimed at 
equalizing teacher salaries statewide including 20 million this 
year 
full funding of the state health insurance program with no 
deductibles or copayments and without benefit reductions 
full funding of the teachers retirement system 
caperton called the meetings with the teacher representatives 
cordial and fruitful 
and although we have not yet reached a final agreement on 
returning teachers to the classrooms we have closed the distance 
between ourselves and that goal caperton said 
earlier in the day caperton postponed a speech on education 
policy he was due to deliver tuesday because of the continuing 
discussions his office said in a statement the speech was 
rescheduled for wednesday night 
morse said at least part of the reason was because the governor 
had very little sleep monday night after holding talks for seven 
hours 
while the two sides gathered around a table in the governors 
conference room at the capitol on tuesday teachers walked picket 
lines at various places around the state 
the state department of education said schools were closed 
tuesday in 25 counties open in 19 and mixed in 11 others the 
number of teachers and students affected was not immediately 
available said education spokeswoman carolyn spangler 
teachers in greenbrier county agreed tuesday night to return to 
work beginning monday the school board which had threatened to 
fire teachers who failed to report for work wednesday said it 
would withdraw letters threatening the dismissals 
in jefferson county teachers face fines and a contempt of court 
citation if they dont return to work by thursday but the teachers 
said they would ask the state supreme court on wednesday to halt an 
injunction ordering them back to work 
spangler said several counties have discussed seeking court 
injunctions to limit pickets 
the states average teacher salary is 21904 less than 
teachers in every state except arkansas and south dakota according 
to the national education association

jimmy carter the architect of the camp 
david peace accords said tuesday he doesnt expect the collapse of 
israels government to ruin chances for a palestinianisraeli 
dialogue and eventual peace in the middle east 
the former president said he hopes a singleparty government 
will emerge from israels political turmoil to avoid the timidity 
and stalemate of coalition government 
i do think there is still a good chance for dialogue 
carter said after a meeting with president hosni mubarak 
the basic parameters have been worked out he said 
theres agreement among the palestinians the egyptians the 
americans and i think more than half the israelis so i believe 
its going to happen it may be delayed to some degree 
tuesday israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir fired his finance 
minister and political adversary shimon peres ten ministers from 
peres leftleaning labor party followed their leader out of the 
cabinet and the tenuous political alliance that has ruled israel 
for six years collapsed 
the government fell due to clashes over us proposals for an 
israelipalestinian dialogue 
labor has accepted the idea of talking to palestinian deportees 
and arab residents of israeliannexed east jerusalem 
but likud opposes both ideas saying they will lead to indirect 
talks with the palestine liberation organization and compromise 
israeli control over a united jerusalem israel considers the plo 
to be a terrorist group and refuses to have a dialogue with it 
following peres dismissal and the mass resignation of his party 
colleagues israel faces eventual elections 
im no expert on israeli politics but ive always had the 
feeling that a leadership of either likud or labor is better than 
having a coalition government carter said 
he said he was discouraged in may 1977 when menachem begin led 
his likud bloc to its first electoral victory since israels 
statehood in 1948 
i never believed that the likud under him would move forward 
in a courageous way toward peace the former president said 
but begin later joined carter and egypts former president anwar 
sadat in signing the camp david accords of 1978 which led a year 
later to the first and only peace treaty between israel and an arab 
nation 
so i dont really think it matters one way or another which 
party ultimately triumphs even if the likud should triumph i 
think this might bode better for a strong move towards peace than 
to have a stalemated coalition government carter said 
carter is on a private four nation tour of the middle east 
after leaving egypt he is to visit syria israel and jordan 
since leaving office carter has visited the middle east four 
times to monitor peace efforts

say goodbye to the cold war and say hello 
to love soviet style 
with eastwest differences crumbling like the berlin wall a 
us housewife is warming up international relations with a dating 
service that links prospective marriage partners from opposite 
sides of the iron curtain 
marie helbog is the founder and director of scanna 
international a correspondence and introduction club which she 
runs out of her suburban rochester home 
helbog a mother of four started scanna in 1980 20 years after 
she and her husband moved to the united states from denmark the 
groups membership expanded from scandinavians and americans to 
other nationalities 
following the rapid changes in eastern europe scanna arranged 
for its first soviet representative last fall 
already helbog has about 1000 members in the soviet union and 
airmail envelopes from russia with love pour in at a rate of about 
150 a week 
all these russians she said last week were so 
overwhelmed 
scanna also has a large number of polish members and hopes to 
begin placing ads and operating in hungary and czechoslovakia soon 
letters have begun trickling in from wouldbe suitors in other 
eastern european countries who have seen scanna ads in american 
magazines 
scanna which has about 3000 members at any one time also 
matches pen pals but most members are marriageminded helbog said 
members fill out a questionnaire describing their interests and 
personality and explaining what theyre looking for in a partner 
in return they receive photographs and profiles of prospective 
matches 
fees range from about 20 for a choice of pen pals to about 90 
for a selection of marriage partners 
scannas american members most of whom are men have shown 
great interest in soviet and polish women apparently considering 
them either more exotic or more domestic helbog said theyre 
all checking that box off she said 
i like cleanliness and order i cook wonderfully writes 
olga z a 31yearold soviet teacher from nakhodka seeking a man 
with modern views i would like to feel like a woman when i am 
near him 
olga k a 28yearold nutrition specialist from vladivostok 
also in the soviet union describes herself as elegant and refined 
looking for a strongwilled man who is aristocratic in character 
and soul 
it is good of you if you understand that attention 
admiration care and compliments and flowers are of great 
importance for women 
helbog said recent changes have made it easy for soviets who 
marry americans to leave the soviet union something that a decade 
ago would have meant months or years of red tape 
she said she often receives letters and christmas cards from 
correspondents who have decided to tie the knot but that it is too 
soon to expect to hear from any eastwest couples taking the plunge 
helbog employs one fulltime staff member and three or four 
parttime helpers in the united states a bevy of agents and 
affiliated groups run the overseas operations

a federal judge issued a limited ruling tuesday 
backing the internal revenue services efforts to force lawyers to 
identify clients who pay them more than 10000 in cash 
us district judge vincent l broderick said two manhattan law 
firms must reveal the identities of five such clients but stayed 
his order so that attorneys ronald fischetti and paul goldberger 
could appeal 
he emphasized however that other lawyers could be exempt 
because of special circumstances 
the judge said that as the law now stands the issue must be 
decided on a casebycase basis he urged the irs and the us 
justice department to work with the defense bar to set up 
guidelines for lawyers reporting cash income 
at issue is a 1984 law that requires everyone in trade or 
business to report cash receipts of more than 10000 and the 
source of the payments 
lawyers maintain that the law violates the attorneyclient 
privilege 
fischetti goldberger and their firms were the subjects of the 
first civil lawsuits to be brought in an enforcement campaign 
against lawyers by the irs last week the irs sent summonses to 90 
other attorneys demanding similar information 
both fischetti and goldberger who have handled many organized 
crime and drug cases filled out the required forms but refused to 
identify five clients who paid them more than 10000 in 1986 and 
1987 
in his oral ruling broderick did not specify what special 
circumstances could exempt lawyers from identifying clients on the 
irs forms 
neil sonnett a miami lawyer who is president of the national 
association of criminal defense lawyers said an exemption could be 
made when an attorney is actively representing a client who is 
under indictment 
sonnett said that in the cases of fischetti and goldberger 
their representation of the clients whose identities were being 
sought had already concluded

the pentagon believes the united states and 
its allies could fight and hold off the soviet union in europe 
without using nuclear weapons says the chairman of the house armed 
services committee 
in an extraordinary step that drew immediate criticism from the 
defense department rep les aspin dwis discussed with 
reporters a classified report by the joint chiefs of staff on the 
military net assessment 
we can defend conventionally in europe aspin said shortly 
after maj gen john d robinson publicly discussed with the 
committee an unclassified version of the report 
in a brief exchange with reporters and later before television 
cameras aspin lent significance to the reports omission of the 
issue of when north atlantic treaty organization forces would have 
to resort to nuclear weapons or accept defeat 
previous net assessments included a discussion of this question 
he said 
if an attack comes nato bends but it doesnt break the 
warsaw pact is able to attack and it gets a lot of territory but at 
no point does it look like nato cant contain the war aspin said 
of the classified reports conclusion 
the joint chiefs based that view on soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs announcement in december 1988 of unilateral troop 
reductions and the us intelligence communitys conclusion last 
year that the soviet threat has lessened 
assuming a further positive influence from a ussoviet 
agreement on reducing conventional forces a treaty not expected 
until later this year at that point they the joint chiefs 
say we ought to be able to defend right at the forward line the 
forward base aspin said 
the congressman took it one step further taking into account 
the disintegration of the warsaw pact and the drive for democracy 
in eastern europe 
i look at this net assessment and i say we win we can go the 
other way nato wins the good guys win aspin said 
defense department spokesman pete williams said aspin may 
believe he is free to discuss classified information but as an 
employee of the executive branch im not 
williams said defense secretary dick cheney approved the net 
assessment within the past two weeks and a declassified version of 
the full report might be released early in april 
aspin argued that the changes cited in the report should be 
reflected in cheneys 292 billion defense budget for the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 but he said the spending blueprint 
accounted for none of these 
the defense budget is seriously out of date aspin said 
the proposal calls for a nearly 1 billion increase in spending 
on the strategic defense initiative 55 billion for the b2 
stealth bomber and funding for two landbased nuclear missile 
systems 
cheney has argued that although the soviets have cut their 
conventional forces they continue to upgrade their strategic 
weapons 
however according to aspin a section of the classified report 
states that the soviets strategic change is incomplete and may 
be reversible under some conceivable political and military 
circumstances 
earlier at the armed services committee hearing gen robinson 
said the number of days the west could count on for warning of an 
allout soviet attack had increased previously the united states 
has estimated that it would have 14 days of warning 
but based on last years intelligence community assessment and 
soviet troop reductions robinson said that number can be 
multiplied by a factor of four or five 
postcfe pushes it out further robinson said referring to 
the proposed conventional forces in europe treaty

the bush administration may have enhanced 
prospects for a watershed budget accord in its warm reaction to a 
plan by rep dan rostenkowski or it may just have set a trap for 
democrats 
either way the white house decision to sing praises of the 
ambitious proposal by the democratic chairman of the house ways and 
means committee has congressional democrats in disarray 
by shortcircuiting the budget process and responding to a plan 
that no committee has yet voted upon bush mischievously managed to 
put democrats on the defensive and score points for a willingness 
to negotiate 
in fact there is nothing on the table to negotiate at this time 
furthermore the administrations assertions of disagreement 
with some elements of the package its advocacy of a social 
security freeze and tax increases make it sound like democrats in 
general have embraced such proposals 
in fact rostenkowski thus far has mustered little democratic 
support for his plan it is not before the house and senate budget 
committees which under law must come up with their own 
deficitreduction plans by next month 
the administrations stance enables it to claim credit for a 
willingness to deal on tough budgetdeficit issues while making it 
appear that democrats have proposed what republicans always accused 
them of advocating higher taxes and a desire to tamper with social 
security 
were not trying to be cute on this insists richard g 
darman bushs wily budget director architect of this weeks white 
house maneuvering 
darman says he wants the administrations response to be taken 
on its face a hats off to rostenkowski for putting together the 
first serious proposal that has been put in the public domain by 
democrats 
darman concedes that rostenkowskis proposal is not a formal 
democratic plan but he told reporters tuesday the congressional 
budget committees are not yet close to being able to put together 
a budget resolution and its important that there be something 
there to negotiate with 
many analysts do suggest that the administrations actions this 
week whatever the motive could serve as the catalyst that might 
lead to a longelusive major budget compromise between the white 
house and congress 
such a widebased bipartisan compromise might be the only way 
that the administration could eventually sign off on a measure that 
included tax increases 
bush seemed to point himself in this direction at a news 
conference tuesday when he was asked if he could assure americans 
there would be no tax increase this year as part of a 
deficitreduction package im only one player he said 
he added that he has no plans to change his own views on taxes 
but thats still a lot milder than his read my lips no new 
taxes of yore 
darman has a reputation as a spinner of carefully crafted webs 
in fact darmanesque has become a standard description in the 
nations capital for complicated and often vexing stratagems 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash has tried to play down 
bushs unexpected receptivity to rostenkowskis plan suggesting it 
stems mainly from their personal friendship 
that doesnt speak of any substantive change on the part of 
the president to consider new taxes foley said 
rostenkowskis proposal would raise the tax rate on the 
highestincome americans from 28 percent to 33 percent and increase 
excise taxes on gasoline liquor and tobacco it would impose a 
oneyear freeze on federal spending including social security 
benefits and it would channel peace dividend defense savings 
into further reducing the deficit 
his plan envisions a balanced budget by 1994 and would replace 
the current grammrudman law which calls for graduated 
deficitreduction steps 
foley asserted that winning approval for new taxes was 
politically and governmentally impossible without the prior 
approval and support of the president who has destroyed any 
opportunity for a longterm deficit reduction by refusing to 
consider such new revenues 
earlier this year the administration was caught off guard when 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny proposed a politically 
appealing plan to reduce social security taxes 
moynihan forced the administration into the awkward political 
posture of having to oppose conservative dogma and go on record in 
opposition to a tax cut 
now with its stance on the rostenkowski proposal the white 
house has come full circle putting democratic leaders in a 
similarly embarrassing position

the united states yielding to the concerns of 
western european allies will propose a plan this week to reduce 
troops and nonnuclear weapons in europe with a key monitoring 
provision deleted a senior bush administration official says 
the abandoned provision called for stationing monitors at 
european ports and weapons factories to guard against violations of 
the 23nation treaty nearing completion in vienna 
but the official who outlined the verification package on 
condition of anonymity said virtually all the allies objected 
strenuously to soviet monitors at their plants and ports 
the revised western proposal will be presented in vienna as 
negotiators for the north atlantic treaty organization and the 
warsaw pact hold their sixth round of talks on a treaty designed 
for signing this year 
whether the goal is achieved could depend on how the soviets 
respond to the western proposal the ball is in their court 
the us official said 
the emerging accord calls for sharp reductions in soviet tanks 
and artillery in eastern and central europe and a ceiling of 
195000 soviet troops in the region there would be much smaller 
cutbacks in us tanks and troops 
the united states could keep 195000 soldiers and airmen in west 
germany belgium the netherlands denmark and luxembourg and an 
additional 30000 in other nato countries 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev want 
the treaty to be ready for signing by the 16 nat0 allies and the 
seven warsaw pact countries at a 35nation summit meeting before 
the end of the year 
but several issues remain unresolved most important among them 
is a procedure to guard against cheating 
the task involves policing the vast expanse of europe from the 
ural mountains in the soviet union to the atlantic ocean to make 
sure the limits on tanks and armored personnel carriers 
antiaircraft artillery airplanes helicopters and troops are 
honored 
the official said a web of safeguards would be offered by 
nato negotiators in vienna including onsite inspection of us 
and soviet troops and tank deployments 
information on nonnuclear armories would be exchanged by the 
two alliances and then its accuracy checked by monitors who would 
go to the military installations 
the monitoring system would be supplemented by aerial 
surveillance under president bushs open skies proposal as well 
as a second system of overflights to check on suspicious 
developments 
and the two sides would have the right to demand to check out 
suspicious movements of troops and equipment under a system of 
challenge inspections 
agreement within nato on these measures and on a plan for 
destroying excess tanks which also will be presented in vienna this 
week would improve prospects for concluding the treaty 
but the official said virtually all the nato allies objected 
to having the kgb standing there as soviet or other warsaw pact 
inspectors were stationed at weapons plants or checked the entry or 
shipment of arms from european ports 
that he said would reveal to the soviets information about the 
manufacture and delivery of western arms that the allies wanted to 
keep secret 
the united states accepted a similar arrangement at american 
plants and ports to police a 1988 treaty with the soviet union to 
ban intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
but when it came to intrusive inspection in europe under the 
conventional forces treaty the allies felt the united states was 
pushing them too hard on the right of manufacturers and their 
national rights the official said 
he added they were most insistent on these points that 
set of proposals went absolutely nowhere in europe 
bush predicted last year that the treaty would be completed by 
this spring at the latest but that prediction has proven overly 
optimistic 
however the official said 90 to 95 percent of the treaty is 
completed

the supreme court is likely to announce soon 
possibly monday whether it will grant a bush administration 
request for speededup review of a new law making it a crime to 
burn the american flag 
the justices in recess this week will meet in a private 
conference friday to consider the request and could announce a 
decision when they return to the bench 
the justice department while expressing doubts about the laws 
constitutionality filed legal papers with the court tuesday urging 
it to move rapidly and uphold the law 
department lawyers called for expedited consideration of the 
politically charged issue proposing oral arguments before the 
court april 25 that would permit the justices to rule before the 
current term ends in july 
the department urged the high court to overturn rulings by two 
judges in washington and in seattle who declared the law 
unconstitutional 
the judges overvalued the narrow category of expressive 
conduct at stake and undervalued the compelling governmental 
interest that lies at the core of the statute the preservation of 
the flag as the unique symbol of our nation the department said 
conviction under the law carries a oneyear jail sentence 
the justice department acknowledged that president bush allowed 
the law to be enacted last oct 28 without his signature because he 
questions its constitutionality and prefers a constitutional 
amendment to assure the same protection for the flag 
bush said he has serious doubts the law can withstand 
supreme court review and said a constitutional amendment is the 
only way to ensure that our flag is protected from desecration 
a lawyer representing the defendants in both flag cases accused 
the administration of seeking expedited supreme court review so 
that the flag will be an issue in this years campaign for house 
and senate seats 
if the court issues its decision in july and its in our 
favor there is no doubt a constitutional amendment will be 
introduced in congress said david cole an attorney with the 
center for constitutional rights 
cole said he will ask the court not to consider the case until 
october because this is a very important constitutional question 
it shouldnt be subject to political considerations 
the supreme court voting 54 last june struck down a texas law 
barring desecration or destruction of the flag the court said 
burning the american flag as a form of political protest is 
protected by the constitutions free speech guarantees 
that case echoed themes from the 1988 presidential campaign in 
which bush stressed patriotic values and attacked his democratic 
opponent gov michael dukakis of massachusetts for vetoing state 
legislation to require that public schoolteachers lead their 
classes in the pledge of allegiance 
the june supreme court decision touched off a political 
firestorm and ultimately led to enactment of the new 
flagprotection law 
democratic leaders in congress supported the law as an 
alternative to a constitutional amendment 
in recent decisions federal judges in washington and in seattle 
dismissed criminal charges against defendants accused of flag 
burning saying the new law violated their free speech rights 
in the washington case three demonstrators were arrested on 
oct 30 after they set several flags on fire during a protest 
outside the us capitol 
four demonstrators were charged with burning a flag outside a 
seattle post office the previous day 
the justice department brief was signed by solicitor general 
kenneth w starr the administrations top courtroom attorney and 
other department lawyers

sir eric gairy the flamboyant 
former prime minister failed tuesday in his comeback attempt in 
grenadas second election since the 1983 usled invasion 
complete but unofficial returns indicated 
however all four political parties opposing gairy also failed 
to gained a parliamentary majority creating uncertainty over who 
will lead the tiny caribbean islands next government 
with final but unofficial results in from all 15 parliamentary 
constituencies the national democratic congress of nicholas 
brathwaite led with seven seats in the house of representatives or 
parliament one short of the necessary majority to form a 
government radio grenada reported 
gairys grenada united labor party won four seats but gairy 
himself was defeated in his parliamentary district the radio said 
citing the electoral commission 
gairy had dominated the islands politics for three decades 
before he was ousted in a marxist revolution 11 years ago 
radio grenada said the national party of acting prime minister 
ben jones and the new national party led by keith mitchell won two 
seats each jones and mitchell were both returned to parliament 
the leftist maurice bishop patriotic movement failed to gain any 
parliamentary seats 
radio grenada said the results were complete but unofficial 
official results were to be announced wednesday 
although the outcome was inconclusive brathwaite 65 a 
moderate who led a 13month interim government after the 1983 
invasion was in a strong position to become the next prime 
minister 
he said before the election that he would not be interested in 
forming a coalition government but most observers thought it 
likely brathwaite and jones would merge their parties to form a 
government 
there was no immediate comment from any of the candidates 
turnout was estimated at 60 percent of the 58296 eligible 
voters sharply below the 85 percent recorded in the 1984 election 
the election happened to fall on the 11th anniversary of the 
marxist coup that toppled gairys authoritarian government on march 
13 1979 and brought to power the peoples revolutionary 
government of the late prime minister maurice bishop 
a rift in bishops government led to his assassination along 
with 10 other people on oct 19 1983 six days later us 
marines and paratroopers along with a small regional force 
invaded the island and ousted a marxist junta that had seized power 
the reagan administration already alarmed by bishops close 
ties with cuba and the soviet union said the invasion was 
necessary to protect hundreds of medical students and prevent the 
island from becoming a bastion of communist aggression in the 
region 
gairy 68 and apparently nearly blind with glaucoma earlier 
said he would not contest the election unless a miracle 
improved his sight 
last month however he said a source greater than i 
ordained that he once again lead grenada he also said the election 
came on the anniversary of his ouster not by coincidence but 
because it had been arranged cosmically by a divine force 
gairy who was grenadas first prime minister after independence 
from britain in 1974 was widely regarded as repressive and 
corrupt as early as 1961 britain dissolved gairys 
preindependence government because of alleged financial 
irregularities 
gairys party won 36 percent of the vote in the 1984 election 
but gained only one seat which it later lost in a party defection 
the merged new national party won 14 seats with 585 percent of 
the vote but later split into three groups 
the election followed the death of conservative prime minister 
herbert blaize in december

young adults face the greatest risk of becoming 
fat and black women are especially vulnerable according to a 
decadelong study of nearly 10000 people from age 24 to 74 
women of both races were twice as likely as men to gain a lot of 
weight and women from 25 to 44 years who began the study 
overweight gained the most weight of all subjects researchers 
found 
among both sexes those ages 25 to 34 were most likely to 
experience a major weight gain according to the study in this 
months archives of internal medicine published by the 
chicagobased american medical association 
the findings suggest that among adults those in their 20s 
should be in the primary target group for obesity prevention 
efforts said the study led by epidemiologist david williamson of 
the nutrition division at the us centers for disease control in 
atlanta 
prevention rather than treatment is the key because so many 
people have trouble losing weight williamson said by telephone 
tuesday 
he recommends just regular sensible exercise like walking 
and eating a diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables 
williamson noted that while women may be more likely to gain 
weight than men previous research has found that men face a 
greater risk of developing weightrelated problems such as heart 
disease and diabetes 
women tend to carry excess weight in the buttocks and hips 
while mens extra poundage usually is concentrated in the stomach 
area nearer the heart and other vital organs and thus more likely 
to cause problems he said 
among women 25 to 34yearsold blacks were 40 percent more 
likely than whites to gain a lot of weight williamsons study 
found for women from 35 to 44 blacks were 80 percent more likely 
to face a major weight gain the researchers found 
as many as onethird of the 9862 subjects were overweight when 
the study began they were measured once between 1971 and 1975 and 
again between 1981 and 1984 
women ages 25 to 44 years who began the study overweight gained 
the most weight of all subjects 
researchers defined a major weight gain as an increase of about 
20 percent or an estimated 30 pounds for a person of average 
height 
among all women ages 25 to 44 who were overweight at the start 
142 percent experienced a major weight gain compared with 56 
percent among men of the same age 
among women of that age group who were of normal weight when the 
monitoring began 62 percent gained a lot of weight compared with 
29 percent among men 
after age 55 weight levels in men and women studied began 
declining 
the researchers did not attempt to explain the weightgain 
differences among women men and blacks williamson said 
factors related to the excess risk of major weight gain that 
may be different in men and women include childbearing diet 
physical activity and patterns of morbidity and mortality the 
researchers wrote 
but they added the question of why women in the united states 
are at substantially greater risk of major weight gain during 
adulthood than men warrants further study 
although women tend to live longer than men they also tend to 
suffer more illnesses which can affect activity and eating levels 
williamson said 
black men were not studied individually because too few of them 
participated in the study he said

meeting with nicaraguan president daniel ortega the man 
conservative republicans like quayle have loved to hate for years 
meeting him face to face and talking over a 1hour lunch in 
santiago chile quayle came away with the observation that 
ortega defeated in the feb 25 election was very cordial very 
polite 
he added he knows what hes doing his conversation was very 
direct 
for perspective the vice president sought the opinion of his 
state department translator stephanie van reigersberg who has 
been in several meetings with ortega over the years

quayle said he said his talk with the nicaraguan was extremely 
positive

federal safety officials are calling for 6000 
new york city subway cars to be equipped with speedometers after 
finding that some were going 15 miles per hour faster than the 
operators thought 
the recommendation came in a national transportation safety 
board meeting tuesday on a crash in which a train carrying 
passengers bumped into a farecollection train at the 103rd street 
station in uptown manhattan on march 10 1989 forty people were 
injured one seriously 
older subway systems in new york boston and philadelphia are 
the only ones in the country without speed indicators on the cars 
said the boards senior rail accident investigator william pugh 
more modern systems are controlled by computers that 
automatically report and control train speed and keep trains spaced 
apart 
the ntsb voted 40 to blame the crash on the unauthorized use of 
a jumper cable that caused signal lights in the station to 
malfunction a light had indicated the station was clear of trains 
investigators said 
the board said the fact the train was going faster than the 
posted 18 mph contributed to the seriousness of the crash but it 
did not blame the operator for the excessive speed saying the new 
york city transit authority failed to furnish a reasonable means 
for operators to determine speed 
damage from the crash totaled 360000 
pugh said checks of new york subways with radar guns found that 
operators usually underestimated their speed often by as much as 
15 mph 
he estimated that retrofitting all of new yorks cars with 
speedometers would cost about 6 million equipping new cars as 
they are added to the system would cost less 
upgrading the 450mile system with computer controls that 
operate most of the nations subway system would cost more than 1 
billion pugh said 
board member jim burnett suggested cars might also be equipped 
with recorders to aid transit officials and investigators in 
determining the speed of cars but the board elected to ask for 
installation of speed indicators first 
the safety panel recommended a change in the design of the 
operator cabin door it said the operator was trapped inside and 
had to be pulled out through a window 
it also called for the transit authority to develop a procedure 
for notifying train operators when an unscheduled train is placed 
in front of them schedules of fare collection trains which travel 
from station to station to pick up cash are not posted for 
security reasons investigators said

a motion granting a former top housing 
official immunity to testify about exhud secretary samuel r 
pierce jr is going to a federal court following unanimous approval 
by a house panel 
the house government operations committee voted 350 on tuesday 
to approve a motion to compel the testimony of dubois gilliam now 
serving an 18month federal prison sentence for a hudrelated 
conviction 
gilliam is expected to testify in late april or early may before 
the government operations housing subcommittee which has been 
investigating scandals at the department of housing and urban 
development during pierces tenure in the reagan administration 
gilliam formerly deputy assistant secretary of hud and a top 
aide to pierce has been cooperating with the committee 
a special prosecutor arlin adams is looking into allegations 
of fraud and influencepeddling in one of the hud programs 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif said the federal 
courts approval is automatic but may take 30 days the immunity 
would mean gilliam could not be prosecuted based on his truthful 
testimony before congress or information derived from that 
testimony 
hud secretary jack kemp meanwhile defended the bush 
administrations proposed housing legislation as serious and 
responsible under critical questioning from democrats in an 
appearance before the house banking committee 
kemp has labeled his housing proposal hope for home 
ownership and opportunity for people everywhere its centerpiece is 
kemps plan for encouraging home ownership among low and 
moderateincome families 
rep charles schumer dny called the proposal more hype 
than hope and long on words and short on action rep joseph 
kennedy dmass said the administrations housing budget is 
woefully inadequate and that by failing to provide new 
subsidized housing it would allow and condone homelessness

mayor marion barry is refusing to answer 
questions about the cocaine possession and perjury charges he 
faces but says his political support is still intact and 
promises to announce soon whether he will seek reelection 
barry who returned to the nations capital tuesday after six 
weeks of substance abuse treatment said he has no plans to resign 
but stopped short of announcing that he will run for a fourth term 
im not going to announce any decisions today barry said as 
supporters chanted four more years 
my political organization is still intact despite some 
defections we will announce some plans in the very near 
future he said 
barry entered a florida substance abuse treatment center three 
days after his jan 18 arrest on a cocaine possession charge and 
enrolled in a south carolina treatment program on feb 22 during 
his absence a federal grand jury returned the indictments 
he said tuesday that he was suffering from alcoholism and from 
addiction to valium and xanax two antianxiety prescription drugs 
top aides have said privately that barry also was suffering from 
a problem with cocaine 
the democratic mayors return to the nations capital resembled 
a campaign speech in a number of ways the address was given in a 
downtown municipal building packed with city employees who 
repeatedly interrupted barrys address with cheering 
barry gave a generally upbeat speech in which he stressed his 
continuing recovery from substance abuse and desire to serve the 
city however he refused to comment on the eightcount criminal 
indictment except for a confident prediction that the truth will 
come out in the trial 
the indictment was returned on feb 15 nearly a month after the 
fbi videotaped barry allegedly smoking crack cocaine in a downtown 
hotel room with a female friend 
barrys remaining supporters were taking a waitandsee attitude 
toward a possible reelection campaign 
were supposed to meet in the next couple of days to hear what 
his decision is said fundraiser jeffrey gildenhorn he did 
come across as very sincere very candid and very human but id 
have to see what kind of a platform he would have before i decided 
to get behind him 
gildenhorn will host a 100perplate breakfast for barrys 
legal defense fund on sunday other supporters have defected 
however 
barrys former financial cochairman is now a spokesman for the 
mayoral bid by walter fauntroy the districts nonvoting delegate 
to congress other supporters have distanced themselves while some 
politicians have called for the democratic mayor to resign 
during his statement barry said his faith in god and the love 
of supporters and family members had seen him through his substance 
abuse treatment 
to those persons i am eternally grateful moved and 
humbled barry said im back and i feel good about my 
treatment program i feel good about myself about my wife my son 
and about the people of washington 
the mayor declined to discuss the five cocaine possession counts 
and three perjury charges filed against him referring all 
questions to his attorney r kenneth mundy 
barry blamed his drug problems on repressed anger as well as 
prolonged and overwhelming stress created by his job 
i had no idea of the depths of my problem barry said for 
a long time i had known there was something very wrong and i no 
longer felt good about myself but i did not want to face the 
extent of that problem 
the mayor said top aides including city administrator carol 
thompson would continue managing district affairs while he seeks 
aftercare however he said he will gradually resume his duties

a house committee took this years first 
significant action on a major civil rights bill for disabled 
americans on the same day that scores of protesters demanding its 
immediate enactment were arrested and carted off in their 
wheelchairs 
it is a priority for passage in this session of the 
congress house speaker thomas s foley dwash told unpacified 
demonstrators tuesday inside the capitol 
the energy and commerce committee meantime approved the 
americans with disabilities act by a 403 vote after amending it to 
soften the impact on amtrak and make other minor changes 
police arrested 104 people many of whom had chained their 
wheelchairs together after deliberate acts of civil disobedience 
following a confrontation in the capitol rotunda with foley and 
house minority leader robert h michel rill 
i am absolutely satisfied it will reach the floor we will 
have a conference with the senate and it will become law foley 
told the demonstrators will it be on the floor in 24 hours no 
protesters demanding that the bill be passed within one day 
greeted that remark with boos 
advocates say that further delays leave the bill vulnerable to 
killer amendments such as one that would exempt small 
businesses from requirements to accommodate people with handicaps 
the compromise between disabilities activists and the amtrak 
passenger railroad was the first house committee vote on the bill 
this year the education and labor committee approved the bill last 
november by a vote of 350 the senate where one committee had 
jurisdiction passed the bill last september by a 768 vote 
full hearings are expected later this month by both the house 
judiciary and public works and transportation committees meaning 
the landmark legislation could become law this spring 
the pace of the bill through congress has slowed considerably 
since last fall when supporters predicted president bush would 
receive a bill by christmas 
the bill would guaranteed the rights of americas disabled 
population estimated to be at least 43 million to employment 
phone service and public and private accommodations such as 
restaurants shops and shopping malls 
members of the small business community say the bill imposes an 
unfair and costly burden on them at the same time it sets 
illdefined standards that will lead to endless litigation 
supporters point to the enthusiastic support of the white house 
and say the senate version carefully phases in the requirements 
while exempting the smallest businesses from its employment 
provisions 
recent statements by the justice department have raised 
questions about white house commitment to the bill because of its 
relationship to other civil rights legislation that the white house 
opposes 
those questions combined with delays in moving the bill through 
congress gave rise to a peaceful demonstration monday outside the 
capitol and the more boisterous one tuesday 
capitol police spokesman gt nevitt said the protesters face 
possible sentences of up to six months in jail on each of the 
charges against them unlawful entry and demonstrating inside the 
capitol the first charge has a maximum fine of 100 and the 
second 500 
all were being held while an attorney negotiated for their 
release nevitt said

the head of the armys star wars 
antimissile research endorses the idea of building a limited 
usbased defense against an accidental or rogue launch of soviet 
nuclear missiles 
were very interested in it here said gen robert d 
hammond commander of the strategic defense command whose 
antimissile work accounts for about onethird of the pentagons 
total effort to develop a defense against globecircling ballistic 
missiles 
many members of congress including sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee have advocated a 
limited star wars defense that could protect against an accidental 
or unauthorized soviet missile launch the pentagon has been cool 
to the idea and the bush administration has not officially 
endorsed it 
supporters of the strategic defense initiative the formal name 
for star wars fear that emphasis on a limited protection system 
would turn the nation away from former president reagans grander 
original vision announced seven years ago of building a spacebased 
defense against a fullscale soviet attack 
a defense against accidental missile launches would be almost 
totally landbased 
in a wideranging interview with a group of reporters visiting 
the armys advanced research center where sdi work is conducted 
hammond said he liked the idea of a limited defense because it 
would use weapons and tracking systems already under development by 
the army the air force is in charge of most spacebased elements 
of star wars research 
weve done considerable planning and analysis of what might be 
involved if a decision were made to deploy it there has been no 
such decision hammond said 
the main feature of a limited system would be groundbased 
interceptor rockets designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles 
before they reenter the earths atmosphere one hundred such 
rockets could be deployed at a single us site without violating 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
james c katechis manager of the armys landbased interceptor 
program said the first flight test is scheduled for this summer 
he declined to give an exact date 
other officials at the army research center repeatedly 
discouraged reporters from inquiring about a limited missile 
defense william congo an army public affairs officer said a 
series of briefings for reporters was deliberately designed not to 
focus on the subject 
asked why congo said because its not a program meaning 
the limited defense idea does not have official defense department 
backing 
hammond stressed that he believed an accidental 
launchprotection system should not be the final goal of the 
pentagons missile defense research 
he said it should be capable of being expanded to add 
spacebased elements that would give broader protection against 
missiles 
even so hammond appeared to cast doubt on whether congress ever 
will approve a grander star wars system i dont know if a 
decision ever is going to be made to deploy a fullup strategic 
defense as advocated by president bush he said 
in earlier comments hammond was more upbeat about the outlook 
for star wars he said that despite recent cutbacks in sdi 
spending bush still should be able to make a decision soon on 
whether to move from research development and testing to actual 
deployment 
i believe easily within the next three years a decision could 
be made on deployment yes or no are you going to put up a 
defense hammond said 
he added however that the timetable would slip if congress did 
not approve at least a modest increase in financing beyond the 36 
billion allocated for the current fiscal year bush has requested 
about 45 billion for the 1991 budget

by the house government operations committee

increased imports of highpurity heroin have 
encouraged a new variant smoking heroin among american drug 
addictions said david l westrate in charge of operations at the 
us drug enforcement administration 
i dont want to give the impression that its widespread he 
said weve seen some evidence over the past year in san 
francisco and new york 
american addicts have generally injected the heroin into a vein 
in liquid form with a hypodermic needle in other countries 
heroin is more widely smoked like the opium from which it comes 
westrate pointed to the increased fear among addicts of infected 
needles the use of a dirty needle by several addicts is one of the 
most important ways in which aids has been spread he also noted 
that many drug users in this country have become used to smoking 
crack a potent form of the cocaine derived from coca leaf and 
grown largely in latin america 
they get such a stimulus from the crack that they need to 
come down with a depressant heroin he told a task force on 
narcotics set up by the house foreign affairs committee 
in a brief interview after the hearing on tuesday he explained 
that a comparatively weak solution of heroin can be injected but 
the human body will tolerate much purer heroin when it is smoked

leftist rebels say theyve 
called off assassination attempts on civilian officials and attacks 
on public transport to show theyre serious about resuming peace 
talks with the rightist government 
it is now up to president alfredo cristianis government 
salvador sanchez ceren a member of the guerrilla directorate told 
a news conference in mexico city he has the ball lets see him 
play with it 
guerrilla commanders also said tuesday that they have purchased 
arms from ussupported nicaraguan rebels and other central 
american sources so they have not been affected by the electoral 
loss of their sandinista allies in nicaragua 
the commanders said they would suspend the unpopular civilian 
attacks to try to seize the initiative against the salvadoran 
government and avoid blame for extending the 10yearold war 
in a communique the farabundo marti national liberation front 
said that as of friday it would cease attacks on public transport 
commercial establishments and telephone lines 
the communique said the guerrilla front also would halt attacks 
on government officials and civilians who are not part of the 
military or paramilitary apparatus of the armed forces of el 
salvador 
schafik handal another member of the fronts fiveperson 
general command said government and guerrilla negotiating 
positions have not changed since october when the two sides met in 
san jose costa rica 
they are setting preconditions that would paralyze our 
activity on a military and political level thats unrealistic 
he said 
he said the guerrillas were ready to join a political process in 
el salvador but their major condition remains the same the armed 
forces must be purified reduced and restructured to get rid of 
those who have tried to suppress political pluralism in favor of a 
narrow oligarchy 
the two commanders said the salvadoran army is planning to 
launch attacks on the guerrillas because they believe the guerrilla 
front has been weakened by the sandinista election loss in 
nicaragua last month president daniel ortega is to give way to 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro on april 25 
we are not now receiving arms from nicaragua and we have 
never depended on nicaragua for arms said handal that is 
about to become clearer central america is a huge arms market 
we have bought arms from the contras and we have the chance to 
buy more sanchez said 
the ussupported contra guerrillas based in honduras which 
lies between nicaragua and el salvador have been fighting the 
sandinista government since 1981 and are negotiating to disband and 
return to nicaragua following mrs chamorros victory 
the contras have sold weapons to the leftist salvadoran rebels 
in the past guerrillas encountered using the weapons in the 
countryside complained that they were old and beat up but 
sanchezs was the first confirmation from a senior guerrilla 
commander 
sanchez called the elections in nicaragua a great example of 
democracy that should be pursued all over latin america 
he added that the question for the cristiani government is 
whether it will open up a real democratic process 
handal noted that although el salvadors population is almost 
twice as large as nicaraguas the two nations have about the same 
number of registered voters more than 17 million in nicaragua 
about 18 million in last years salvadoran presidential election 
and that abstentions brought the total vote in el salvador down to 
less than 1 million in a nation of more than 52 million 
handal added the salvadoran guerrillas would not consider 
themselves subject to any decisions made by the central american 
presidents who are holding a summit on march 3031 in managua 
more than 71000 people mostly civilians have been killed in 
the decadeold war

he owns no shoes only boots he rides a 
horse like a cowhand he admits to two fistfights since turning 50 
and likes a cold beer after work 
and now millionaire oilmanrancherbusinessman clayton 
williams whose hero is john wayne is the republican nominee for 
governor 
when we began this journey there werent a whole lot of folks 
who gave us much of a shot williams told a hotel ballroom full 
of whooping supporters after humbling all comers in tuesdays gop 
primary 
in the words of that worldfamous philospher jackie gleason 
how sweet it is 
williams 58 combined his folksy humor love of all things 
texan and a multimilliondollar tv ad campaign that rivaled a 
hollywood movie to rise from an asterisk in the early polls to an 
outright norunoff victory 
throughout the primary he showed a knack for publicity and a 
charisma that his trio of lawyerchallengers couldnt touch 
when told that one of his wild weststyle tv commercials seemed 
to lack only john wayne or gary cooper williams aide mona palmer 
seemed puzzled 
we have clayton she said why would we need them 
he was endorsed by retired texas rangers he nicknamed his 
campaigns barbecue truck lonesome gov stumping in abilene he 
grabbed a sledgehammer and personally demonstrated his plan to have 
drug dealers bustin rocks 
as his campaign cruised to conclusion claytie saw 
supporters clamoring for autographs and tv network correspondents 
lining up for interviews 
gop rival tom luce called williams a candidate more suited to 
the 1890s saying you cant ride horseback into the space age 
williams just laughed i didnt know i had as many faults as i 
seem to have until i became the frontrunner he said 
an unknown political commodity making his first bid for office 
the midland businessman spent nearly 6 million of his own money on 
his 8 million campaign 
williams says he founded 26 companies and created more than 
100000 jobs since his graduation from texas aampm in 1954 those 
included clajon gas co the largest individually owned natural gas 
company in the state and the claydesta long distance phone company 
williams ruled out a tax increase and said he opposed abortion 
in most cases pledging an allout war on drugs and promising to 
put a businessbased balance sheet to government williams 
delighted in bashing career politicians 
opponents including railroad commission chairman kent hance 
criticized his lack of experience in government williams said that 
was a plus 
the biggest applause i get is when i say im not a politician 
and im not a lawyer the longer politicians are in austin or 
washington the worse job they seem to do he said 
the three other major republican candidates all were lawyers 
the top three democrats were current or former officeholders 
drugs are his top issue williams said and a major reason he 
decided to run a son became involved with drugs in 1986 while 
he made it a lot of those little kids didnt and theyre in my 
heart he said 
williams said he can persuade the democraticcontrolled 
legislature to do things his way pledging to lobby lawmakers 
personally a sales call if you will 
i am a very good salesman he said urging onlookers to 
study his attractive wife modesta take a good look at me look 
at my profile now look at modesta you think im not the

psychoanalyst bruno bettelheim a student of 
sigmund freud who taught that violent fantasies and fairy tales 
were part of a healthy childs psychology killed himself at a 
nursing home at age 86 authorities said 
bettelheim died tuesday of suicidal asphyxiation at the charter 
house in silver spring md said dr john e smialek marylands 
medical examiner smialek declined to give details friends said 
bettelheim recently had suffered a stroke 
a survivor of the nazi death camps bettelheim came to the 
united states during world war ii and became a pioneer in treating 
childhood mental disturbances his vivid writings reached millions 
of readers 
from 1944 to 1973 bettelheim ran the sonia shankman orthogenic 
school for disturbed children at the university of chicago 
he had a marvelous talent for being able to see the world 
through the eyes of the other even if the other was a tremendously 
bizzare person said jacquelyn sanders who took over the school 
when bettelheim retired he was able to see the world through 
that persons eyes so that person no longer became bizzare 
and he was able to write about them in the way people could 
understand 
the uses of enchantment written with karen zelan in 1976 
won bettelheim the national book award and the national book 
critics circle award 
in it he held that fairy tales represent the struggle for 
identity that children wage against their parents hostile 
fantasies toward parents can be safely channeled through enjoyment 
of punishment inflicted on witches and demons 
a december review in the chicago tribune of his last book 
freuds vienna and other essays noted bettelheims shrewd 
grasp of the sometimes petty human circumstance behind the grand 
achievement 
for example bettelheim admitted becoming interested in freuds 
theories at age 13 in order to impress a girl 
bettelheim was born aug 28 1903 in vienna and studied there 
under freud a jew he was sent to the dachau and buchenwald 
concentration camps after his release in 1939 he gained early 
fame for his study of death camp prisoners 
in surviving an essay published in the new yorker in 1976 
he said prisoners who survived were those who lived not for lifes 
sake but for some cultural ideal that transcended them 
at the orthogenic school bettelheim insisted on constant 
attention for severely disturbed children and stayed there from 
early morning until after midnight nearly every day said benjamin 
wright a former colleague 
he would not take no for an answer no matter how difficult the 
child was said wright 
the schools success stories include several college professors 
authors and a stockbroker he said 
dr raymond fowler chief executive of the american 
psychological association in washington said bettelheims 1950 
book on his experiences at the school love is not enough 
influenced fowler to become a psychologist 
some of bettelheims theories were criticized as overly harsh on 
parents he contended at one time that mentally ill mothers were 
responsible for autism in children 
he softened his views in the 1987 book a good enough parent 
a book on childrearing which said parents are innately good 
enough to raise children 
bettelheim became professor emeritus at the university of 
chicago in 1975 
he told me that once you were in a camp you could never 
escape the cruelty a longtime colleague and friend rudolf 
ekstein told the new york times he turned it upside down when 
he started his school for disturbed children it was a protected 
caring environment the mirror opposite of the camps 
his other works included dynamics of prejudice 1950 
truants from life 1955 the informed heart 1960 and 
the children of the dream 1969 
bettelheims wife gertrud weinfeld died in 1984 he is 
survived by three children 
funeral arrangements were not immediately known

the next big clash between cuba and the united 
states is just over the horizon literally it takes the form of a 
us balloon floating above the florida keys designed to beam 
capitalist programming to cuba 
after years of preparations testing of the voice of america 
broadcast operation will begin shortly and cuban officials are 
guaranteeing an energetic response to what they regard as a blatant 
intrusion on national sovereignty 
they want no part of us news shows sitcoms and soap operas 
they are not convinced by us arguments that the station known as 
tv marti will not be a propaganda mouthpiece for rightist 
militants 
teleaggression is just one of the epithets that communist 
president fidel castro uses in denouncing the us plan 
speaking to a gathering of 50000 students tuesday night castro 
said the bush administration officials are not even capable of 
appreciating how much they offend the heart and the sentiments of 
our people 
castro said that despite setbacks in eastern europe and 
elsehwere in the socialist world the cuban revolution will survive 
because it is based on just ideas the ideals of our country are 
immortal he said 
castro was flying today to brazil for the presidential 
inauguration in that country 
ramon sanchez parodi a vice foreign minister says cuba is 
considering a range of retaliatory measures for tv marti including 
curtailing travel and telephone communications between cuba and the 
united states 
another possibility is that cuba with the use of highpowered 
trnasmitters will interfere with us radio broadcasts over a huge 
area west of the mississippi 
at a minimum cuba will take steps to ensure that tv marti will 
not reach cuban living rooms 
we have absolutely no doubt we can block the signal says 
gary gonzalez a vice president of the cuban institute of radio and 
television 
the planned jamming comes months after the soviet union and its 
former east european satellites embracing democratic reform 
stopped jamming western radio broadcasts 
technical problems have led to repeated delays in initiating the 
testing phase of tv marti the latest target date is sometime this 
month 
the station is seen as a televised version of radio marti a voa 
project named for 19th century cuban revolutionary jose marti that 
beams news and entertainment designed for cuban audiences 
the signal for tv marti is to be sent from a tethered balloon 
about 10000 feet above the florida keys a lofty perch is required 
to ensure the signal is not blocked by the curvature of the earth 
part of the rationale for the tv and radio projects is that the 
cuban people us officials say have been systematically denied 
access to balanced information in the governmentcontrolled media 
says rep john miller rwash we are in a struggle of ideas 
which is better than military struggle castro has never offered 
not to spread his ideas throughout latin america 
some cubans see tv marti as a potentially bright addition to the 
drab fare often transmitted on their stations 
but gonzalez said the portrayal of cuba as a country closed to 
outside influence is misleading he says 42 percent of all movies 
shown on cuban television are americanmade 
there are also a number of usmade programs for american 
children shown in cuba he says 
the legislation that created tv marti permits a 90day period 
after the initial testing to evaluate legal and technical 
considerations before actual programming can begin 
but sanchez parodi says the cuban response will be delivered 
immediately after testing begins 
we will do more than just block the signal he says 
cuban officials argue the proposed station violates un 
agreements that protect local broadcasting systems from outside 
interference 
they also see tv marti as yet another element in a continuing 
us campaign to undermine castros threedecadeold rule 
but the bush administration may be forced to scuttle the project 
because of technical problems 
some us officials say there is not much the administration can 
do if cuba succeeds in blocking the transmission 
beyond that there also is concern that the project may 
interfere with broadcasting by south florida stations under the 
legislation if that problem cannot be resolved tv marti must be 
turned off

indians unable to afford hearses no longer 
have to use pickup trucks to ferry their dead to reservations for 
burial 
they can now turn to the urban indian hearse project which has 
taken 217 people home free of charge since the nonprofit 
organization made its first run in october 1987 
the project evolved out of a small group of people who used to 
take the dead from the twin cities to reservations in personal 
vehicles as a kindness said john stone who coordinates the effort 
from indian family services in south minneapolis 
they would take them back in the back of a pickup truck or 
station wagon or whatever that they could partly because the cost 
that a funeral home charges to transport a body from the urban 
area stone said 
for example the transportatio cost from a twin cities funeral 
home to the red lake indian reservation in northern minnesota a 
539mile round trip is around 900 stone said 
some of the metropolitan areas 18000 american indians had no 
choice but to inter their dead in local and unfamiliar cemeteries 
without transportation they couldnt use free plots among their 
relatives on tribal burial grounds said stone who lives in 
bloomington and grew up on the white earth reservation in 
northwestern minnesota 
that changed with the donation of two used hearses by the 
minnesota chippewa tribe and the formation of the hearse project 
its meant that theyve been able to have the type of funeral 
important to the indian heritage said david karsnia owner of 
the daviddonehower funeral home in detroit lakes which serves 
white earth 
charles stately of minneapolis is among those who have donated 
to the hearse project he remembers what it did for his family when 
his mother elaine m stately died in august 1988 
it was a hard time and my mother was a long way from where 
she was born and wanted to be it was real nice to deal with 
indians stately said all the things that happened were hard 
to handle except that part of it that went smoothly 
with the hearse projects help stately was able to fulfill his 
mothers wish to be buried on the white earth reservation where 
she was born 
its where her family has their roots she identified with the 
land he said 
the rev james notebaart with the office of indian ministry for 
the archdiocese of st paul and minneapolis sees the project in 
spiritual terms 
its not a business and its not an attempt to be cheap but 
its part of their whole sense of unity and communion in life and 
death he said

what if you dont want to open your mouth wide 
have a needle plunged into your gums and feel a drill grinding the 
most tender of your teeth 
just be patient and look forward to that asyetunscheduled 
dental appointment in the year 2000 thats when dental experts 
believe the drill will be obsolete and the needle replaced with an 
electronic anesthesia machine 
the technology will be demonstrated to 17000 dental 
professionals attending the 78th annual thomas p hinman dental 
meeting friday through monday in atlanta 
among research to be presented is the development of a laser 
that experts predict will make the dental drill obsolete by the end 
of this decade 
the 1990s are going to be incredible for dentistry said dr 
tom truhe director of the princeton dental resource center in 
princeton nj 
forty percent of us adults do not have regular dental 
checkups studies blame this failure on many peoples belief that 
they do not need checkups as well as on the fear of needles and 
drills 
were working on reasons two and three truhe said adding 
that a time lapse of eight to 10 years exists between the time new 
techniques are developed and the time they are used in dental 
offices 
the laser being studied at the university of detroit vaporizes 
tooth decay without the noise vibration or smell often associated 
with dental drills 
truhe said lasers also decrease the chances of tooth decay 
returning around fillings 
but while lasers can penetrate dentin the second level of 
tooth covering they have not been able yet to pass through the 
hardest and outermost tooth layer enamel 
also truhe said the us food and drug administration so far 
has approved lasers only for use on soft tissues 
still there is little doubt truhe said that lasers will be 
the standard of care for repairing dental cavities by the year 2000 
also electronic anesthesia machines have been developed to 
deaden pain through battery power the fdaapproved machines 
already are in use in some dentists offices and are still being 
researched at the university of colorado 
the machines employ electrical impulses that travel through 
battery wires to small adhesive pads attached to the patients 
mouth 
truhe explained that the impulses deaden pain by flooding nerves 
with nonpainful stimuli so that painful stimuli cannot pass 
through the impulses also increase the brains production of 
painlessening chemicals such as serotonin and endorphins

the un security councils five permanent members 
have proposed an ambitious administrative role for the united 
nations in cambodia diplomats said today reporting progress 
toward ending the countrys civil war 
a communique released after two days of talks in paris appealed 
to cambodias warring factions to delegate all necessary powers 
to the un during a transitional period in which free elections 
would be organized 
under the proposal the four cambodian factions would jointly 
form a supreme national council that would occupy the countrys 
seat in the united nations but cede daytoday administrative 
responsibility to the un 
us diplomats said at a briefing today that the five permanent 
security council members the united states soviet union 
britain france and china had made significant progress 
toward agreement on details of the proposal 
they said a unified approach by the un would be needed to 
persuade the cambodian factions to compromise after more than 11 
years of civil war 
factions involved are the government of premier hun sen 
installed by vietnam and the resistance coalition of three parties 
the khmer rouge a communist group that is the strongest 
guerrilla organization and noncommunist insurgent forces led by 
prince norodom sihanouk cambodias former ruler and son sann a 
former premier 
the proposal by the five security council members would require 
the hun sen government to yield sovereignty although a us 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said government 
employees might be allowed to remain in their posts under un 
supervision 
details of the possible size and cost of the un contingent 
have not been made final an american official said there was no 
precedent for a un force administering an entire country in 
addition to arranging elections 
one obstacle during previous talks among the cambodian factions 
was the opposition of khieu samphan a khmer rouge leader and vice 
president of the guerrilla coalition to using the word 
genocide to describe khmer rouge actions in cambodia in 197578 
the khmer rouge government led by pol pot killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodias 8 million people while trying to turn the 
country into an agrarian commune a vietnamese invasion in december 
1978 overthrew the pol pot regime 
a us official said the dispute over the genocide issue had 
been used in the past to obstruct negotiations and expressed hope 
that it could be set aside temporarily 
we believe those responsible for genocidal violence presently 
have little electoral support he said 
all factions have indicated previously they would accept some 
un role including election supervision but there is 
disagreement over how cambodia should be governed until the 
elections are held 
hun sen and his vietnamese backers have contended that 
dismantling the government might open the way for the khmer rouge 
to seize power again 
attending the paris talks were richard solomon us 
undersecretary of state david gillmore undersecretary in the 
british foreign office claude martin frances director of asian 
affairs igor rogachev of the soviet union xu dunxin of china vice 
ministers of foreign affairs and rafeeuden ahmed a un assistant 
secretarygeneral 
the parties plan to meet again in paris in may and have asked 
the un to provide detailed logistical information for use in 
future discussions 
on the agenda in may according to diplomats will be the 
current cambodian military situation the prospects for some sort 
of peacekeeping force and the issue of whether vietnamese troops 
have resumed military support of hun sen despite assurances of a 
september withdrawal

the tokyo stock exchanges chief index closed at 
its lowest level in a year today while the dollar declined against 
the yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 26844 points or 082 
percent ending the day at 3235213 its lowest level since march 
28 1989 when it closed at 3230636 
dealers attributed the indexs losses to intermittent selling by 
arbitrageurs mainly foreign securities firms throughout the day 
after a series of rises and falls the index ended the morning 
session with a 894point gain when indexlinked buying won over 
artibrage selling traders said but it soon fell back due to 
selling by pessimistic institutional investors in addition to 
arbitrageurs said yasumasa shinagawa a yamaichi securities dealer 
investors have little interest in buying issues because 
economic factors around the market remain the same without any 
positive incentives he said 
participants are now trying to push down the index until the 
market hits bottom shinagawa said he said traders expect the 
bottom will lie somewhere below 31000 points 
dealers said institutional investors were inclined to sell ahead 
of the fiscal yearend account settlements for company budgets 
earmarked for investments in financial markets 
account settlement for fiscal 1989 for most japanese 
institutional investors is slated for thursday 
there are only a limited number of issues that participants 
find safe to invest in because they think company performances 
have been poor due to the stock exchanges plunge this year said 
a dealer with nomura securities speaking on condition of anonymity 
analysts have blamed computeraided largescale arbitrage 
trading in which participants profit from price gaps between the 
spot and futures markets for recent sharp declines in the nikkei 
index especially when overall volume is low 
todays volume on the markets first section was estimated at 
480 million shares up slightly from tuesdays 400 million 
the nikkei index on tuesday registered its fourthlargest 
decline this year dropping 74766 points or 224 percent because 
of a wave of arbitrage selling dealers said 
following a combined decline of 137255 points on monday and 
tuesday the nikkei index has lost more than 6500 points or 169 
percent since the beginning of this year 
in currency dealings the dollar ended trading at 15220 yen 
down 047 yen from tuesdays closing of 15267 yen it opened lower 
at 15190 yen and ranged between 15170 yen and 15247 yen 
the dollar weakened today mainly because of technical 
adjustments and profittaking said kenzo shinomiya a trader with 
fuji bank 
the dollars slip is a temporary phenomenon because market 
players have long overbought dollar positions as a result of so 
much dollarbuying around 152 yen he said 
the us currencys fall today does not indicate a trend because 
market demand for the dollar remains strong he said 
other traders said bank of japan governor yasushi mienos 
scheduled return to tokyo from europe on thursday also was putting 
pressure on the dollar since the market expects the central bank 
to raise its official discount rate shortly after he returns 
market players expect the bank to raise the discount rate by as 
much as 1 percentage point from the current 425 percent 
since it has been expected for more than a month a discount 
rate hike is likely to have little impact because the figure is 
already factored into the market shinomiya said 
benchmark no 119 japanese government bonds closed at 8619 
points up 013 from tuesdays closing of 8606 their yield fell 
to 7305 percent from the previous days 7325 percent

a hospital has given out the first 100 
prizes to women who seek early prenatal care in a socalled healthy 
baby lottery 
it wasnt a huge jackpot but it was fun for hope allen one of 
the six expectant mothers who picked up their winnings tuesday 
outside memorial hospital 
itll come in handy but its just the thrill of winning it 
she said 
doctors and nurses hope to generate publicity with the winners 
to entice other pregnant women into making early visits to the 
hospital 
what were trying to do is get a message out to a group of 
women who normally do not listen to health care messages said 
dr larry culpepper of memorial hospitals department of family 
medicine 
six monthly prizes from 25 to 100 will be awarded to women who 
have sought prenatal care before their 12th week of pregnancy 
those who seek care before the 10th week got a 50 bonus every six 
months a 500 drawing will be held for women who complete their 
doctors recommended prenatal care 
deborah piche 26 another lottery winner had no insurance or 
job but went to the doctor after reading about the lottery and won 
50 plus the 50 bonus for seeking care at her seventh week of 
pregnancy 
mrs piche 26 who is having her first child said she would 
have gone to a doctor eventually but i dont think i would have 
gone as soon 
sixtysix women got prenatal checkups in february an average 
number culpepper said but about 55 percent of the women enrolled 
before their 12th week and less than 30 percent do so normally he 
said 
about 6 percent of the babies born to the 1500 women who 
deliver at memorial each year are below normal birthweight they 
run up an average bill of 23000 culpepper said 
so if we prevent one low birthweight baby or one handicapped 
child which i think it is likely to do then i think its worth 
it he said

about 2000 riot police carrying shields 
and clubs formed a human wall near the national assembly today to 
block a march by demonstrators demanding the retirement of elderly 
lawmakers 
it is absurd that we let these senile and selfish assemblymen 
run the nations electoral body shouted hung chichang an 
assemblyman from the opposition democratic progressive party 
the 752seat national assembly is taiwans electoral college and 
will elect the islands next president on march 21 
like the other branches of taiwans tricameral parliament the 
assembly is dominated by elderly nationalist party stalwarts who 
have not faced voters since the government fled to taiwan in 1949 
after losing the chinese civil war 
they have been frozen in office to support a nationalist claim 
to be chinas legitimate government 
the 300 demonstrators chanted slogans demanding the resignation 
of the aged lawmakers and the dissolution of the national assembly 
before their march was halted near the assembly grounds by police 
behind a barbed wire barricade 
they then staged a threehour sitin near the barricades 
the demonstrators led by democratic progressive party chairman 
huang hsinchieh also were angered by an assembly decision tuesday 
that barred all the partys 11 assemblymen from taking their seats 
because they had refused to take an oath to the republic of 
china the name under which the nationalists founded their nation 
in 1911 
the demonstrators claimed the opposition delegates were barred 
so the assembly could ram through changes to the countrys 
constitution including an amendment that would require approval 
from the elderly assemblymen to any bills dictating their 
retirement 
reporters estimated more than 2000 policemen guarded the 
grounds of the national assembly in the picturesque mountain resort 
of yangmingshan in taipeis suburbs 
during the sitin an assembly committee passed a controversial 
proposal for the national assembly to meet annually rather than 
once every six years to review bills adopted by the lawmaking 
legislative yuan 
the proposal was rejected earlier by the nationalist partys 
decisionmaking central standing committee because of public 
pressure the national assembly is to vote on the proposal later 
this month 
four independent assemblymen angered at the committees action 
toppled the podium in the committee room and ripped out microphones 
before leaving the meeting in protest 
this is a big joke a historical blemish of this party said 
sun jungchi a nationalist party assemblyman who was elected in 
taiwan 
many analysts believe the annual meetings will expand the powers 
of the national assembly and hinder future democratic reforms 
president lee tenghui 67 and his running mate presidential 
adviser li yuanzu 66 are expected to be elected to a sixyear 
term by the national assembly despite some opposition even from 
members of the nationalist party 
lee became the first native taiwanese to head the nationalist 
government in 1988 when he was elevated from the vice presidency 
following the death of president chiang chingkuo

the dollar fell against most major foreign 
currencies in moderate european trading today dealers said the 
currency appears to be losing some of its recent bullish momentum 
gold prices rose 
the dollar doesnt have the momentum to go much further just 
now said andrew ellott a senior foreign exchange sales manager 
at chase manhattan bank in london 
kenji kawahara foreign exchange manager at daiichi kangyo bank 
in london attributed the bearish view to a decline in us equity 
and treasury bond prices late tuesday 
dealers said sundays east german elections could set a new 
direction for the foreign exchange markets 
the uncertainty about the elections and the whole political 
situation is a factor that people dont dare to do anything said 
a trader at a us bank in frankfurt 
to trade the dollar higher is also dangerous because the 
central banks could come in even though they havent done much 
recently 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 047 yen to a closing 15220 yen later in london 
it was quoted at a lower rate of 15210 yen

a second man died of burns today after a 
ruptured propane pipeline exploded and destroyed 10 homes in a 
cauldron of fire 
at least four people were injured in the blast tuesday about 40 
miles south of albany the fire burned itself out at about 5 am 
today and a cap was placed on the hole in the pipeline according 
to schoharie county sheriffs officials 
right where were standing was just a big ball of flames 
said schoharie fire department lt joe balfe you couldnt get 
close to anything because you werent sure what was going to blow 
up next 
the 8inch underground pipeline exploded twice as the valley 
community about 40 miles from albany awakened shortly before 8 
am officials said the blast knocked out electricity and phones 
up to 15 miles away 
sheriffs officials said investigators would begin examining the 
damaged pipe later in the day in an effort to find out what caused 
the blast residents said that a foglike vapor had rolled down a 
hill toward their homes just before the explosion 
ten homes were reduced to blackened debris 
they didnt burn long the heat was so intense said shirley 
hilgers whose convenience store escaped damage they were down 
in 10 15 minutes 
richard smith 43 of central bridge died tuesday early today 
robert hitchcock 53 of north blenheim died at westchester county 
medical center 
hitchcocks 16yearold daughter roberta was in fair condition 
at ellis hospital in schenectady with burns on her face and hands 
and michael kodra 58 of howes caves was treated for burns and 
released officials said 
two others linda huber 31 of north blenheim and her 
4yearold son shawn were treated for smoke inhalation and 
released from community hospital of schoharie county in cobleskill 
the pipeline owned by texas eastern products pipeline is part 
of a system that begins in mont belvieu texas and winds its way 
4100 miles to selkirk about 10 miles from albany said company 
spokesman john barnett 
more than 300 firefighters ambulance workers and law 
enforcement officials descended on blenheim and worked nearly three 
hours putting out fires 
the propane which is heavier than air apparently seeped about 
a mile along a creek bed into a small valley where the houses were 
located 
virginia noxon said she was in her kitchen when the propane 
washed over her house 
i looked out my kitchen door and i saw all this white stuff 
building up and i said ive never seen fog like this before 
she said i turned around and everything blew it got all pink 
and everything and at first i thought it was a tornado then i 
heard bang bang bang everything blowing up 
the force of the explosions blew her across the room but she 
was not injured 
when it first happened we thought an airplane had crashed 
into the side of the hill said liz mace i was just getting 
ready for work and there was this horrendous explosion it sounded 
like a jet when they pass the sound barrier

lawmakers of both parties are lining up behind 
president bushs request for a quick infusion of 300 million for 
nicaragua but problems are arising that could slow the packages 
progress through congress 
bush asked congress on tuesday to provide the money by april 5 
to help incoming president violeta chamorro rebuild the central 
american countrys warweakened economy 
he added another request that lawmakers approve a stalled 500 
million in aid for panama which the president proposed after the 
united states overthrew gen manuel antonio noriega 
the 800 million in immediate aid for nicaragua and panama would 
be diverted from the current military budget perhaps the first 
real peace dividend from the receding cold war 
the important thing to keep in mind is that we have an 
opportunity that is just unparalleled rep lee hamilton dind 
a senior member of the house foreign affairs committee said today 
this is a tremendous opportunity to shift the global balance of 
power in a direction favorable to us he said on cbs this 
morning 
appearing with hamilton sen richard lugar rind former 
chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said i 
approve of the presidents plan to assist panama and nicaragua 
we have great opportunities to assist in building new democracies 
speaking at a news conference bush announced the lifting of the 
5yearold trade embargo against nicaragua which the united states 
had used in its efforts to dislodge the leftist sandinista 
government of president daniel ortega and he said he would seek an 
additional 200 million for nicaragua next year 
these nations need our help to heal deep wounds inflicted by 
years of strife and oppression years of loss and deprivation 
bush said and we must act and act soon 
on capitol hill words of support for bushs request soon 
followed 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said lawmakers would 
need more details about where the money would come from and how it 
would be spent but said we want to work with them and do it as 
soon as possible 
the people of nicaragua and panama have courageously opted for 
freedom and democracy said senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan we cant let them down now 
we express our support for both the aid package and the end 
of sanctions the nicaraguan embassy said in a statement it 
invited us experts to inspect nicaraguas economic situation at 
first hand 
complications arose as well however 
sen robert byrd dwva chairman of the senate appropriations 
committee said he would withhold action on bushs request for aid 
for the central american countries until the administration 
proposes specific savings to pay for it 
in a letter to secretary of state james a baker iii byrd 
referred to a conflict between himself and the president that has 
been brewing since last month 
in february bush proposed withholding 22 billion in defense 
spending planned for this year much of it slated for arms projects 
that are popular in congress the administration wants to spend 
some of that money for different weapons and use other parts of it 
for the central american aid 
but the presidents proposal angered byrd and the appropriations 
panels ranking republican sen mark hatfield of oregon they 
argued that bushs plan to stop the spending was illegal and 
called on him to reverse his decision the dispute remains 
unresolved 
we have no interest in delaying action on these important 
matters byrd wrote 
the aid measure could also be slowed by unrelated amendments 
that lawmakers might attach to it 
sen patrick leahy dvt has signaled he will seek to append a 
400 million housing credit program to help israel resettle newly 
emigrated soviet jews and others say there may be efforts to cut 
or restrict aid to el salvador over congressional concerns about 
human rights in that country or efforts to use the bill to boost 
aid to emerging eastern european democracies

millionaire oilmanrancher clayton williams 
got everything he hoped for the republican nomination for 
governor and the prospect of a bruising democratic runoff between 
treasurer ann richards and attorney general jim mattox 
in the words of that worldfamous philosopher jackie gleason 
how sweet it is williams told a hotel ballroom full of 
whooping supporters after humbling all comers in tuesdays gop 
primary with 61 percent of the vote 
with 98 percent of precincts counted the west texas businessman 
got 511007 votes railroad commissioner kent hance a former 
democratic congressman was a distant second with 129662 votes 
or 15 percent further back were lawyer tom luce with 113542 
votes or 14 percent and former secretary of state jack rains 
with 80400 votes or 10 percent 
ms richards and mattox ran neckandneck in the brutal 
democratic race sinking the comeback hopes of former gov mark 
white with 98 percent of precincts reporting ms richards had 
561080 votes 40 percent to mattoxs 521494 or 37 percent 
white received 274551 votes or 19 percent 
because no democrat got more than half the vote the two top 
votegetters will meet in a runoff for the nomination april 10 
before the polls opened williams said he hoped to avoid a 
runoff so he could relax and have some fun watching each of the 
democrats murdering on each other 
on tuesday night he added this has been a spirited primary 
and at times things have gotten a little testy although looking at 
the democrats mess makes us looks like a bunch of sissies 
ms richards told her campaign workers well this is gonna be 
a good night yall but do you have enough money for a runoff 
williams who calls himself just a country boy and admits to 
occasional fistfights spent 8 million 6 million from his own 
pocket in rolling to victory in his first run for office the 
58yearold combined folksy humor love of all things texan and a 
multimilliondollar tv campaign to rise from an asterisk in the 
early polls 
ms richards known for her caustic keynote speech at the 1988 
democratic national convention in which she said thenvice 
president bush was born with a silver foot in his mouth easily 
topped opinion polls after entering the race last june in a bid to 
become the states first woman governor since miriam ma 
ferguson left office in 1935 
but she stumbled after finding herself in a race characterized 
by mudslinging 
rivals lashed out at ms richards a recovering alcholic for 
refusing to say whether she had ever used illegal drugs she 
accused them of profiteering from public service white and mattox 
for their part called ms richards a liar 
in a preview of things to come both ms richards and mattox 
were at one anothers throats moments after white conceded tuesday 
night 
i hope ann gets her consultants under control she ran some 
pretty harsh ads against mark and myself and i hope it stops 
because i intend to discuss the issues mattox said 
ms richards again challenged mattox to follow her lead and make 
public his tax returns its going to be a very difficult 28 
days she warned were going to talk about who truly believes 
in ethics in public office 
in the republican race no challenger could match williams 
bankroll 
after initially pledging to spend 3 million from his own 
pocket he wound up spending far more than that on a nearly 
flawless campaign that included television commercials that 
analysts called some of the best ever 
the democrats are in for the contest of their life in 
november said luce hes a superb nominee for our party 
turnout was estimated at 2 million of the 83 million eligible 
voters who could cast ballots for either party the number voting 
was the highest in a texas primary in an year not involving a 
presidential race 
absentee balloting was expected to account for up to 25 percent 
of the vote it was the first gubernatorial race in texas since the 
state allowed people to vote absentee without stating a reason 
texans also voted on the us senate seat held by republican 
phil gramm who has no gop opponent in his bid for a second term 
state sen hugh parmer a 50yearold fort worth lawyer easily won 
the democratic nomination by defeating harley schlanger a follower 
of extremist lyndon larouche 
jim hightower the state agriculture commissioner who raised 
controversy at every turn pulled 65 percent of the vote to win the 
democratic nomination for reelection against six opponents 
supported by the texas farm bureau 
hightower bills himself a friend of the small independent 
farmer but brought the wrath of some ranchers with his support of 
hormonefree beef republicans last year failed in their bid to 
have the legislature abolish his job 
state sen rick perry will meet richard mciver owner of a 
geologic consulting firm in a runoff for the gop nomination

a sweeping order in the drugtrafficking case 
against manuel noriega provides ground rules for thousands of 
documents defense attorneys say will prove us officials approved 
of the deposed panamanian dictators actions 
us district judge william hoeveler also tentatively scheduled 
the trial of noriega and his codefendants for jan 28 1991 a 
date noriega attorney steven kollin called realistic 
the judge capped weeks of legal wrangling tuesday when he issued 
the 12page protective order defining how the classified 
information procedures act of 1980 will be applied in the noriega 
case 
on the whole im pleased with it noriega attorney david 
lewis an expert on classified documents said in a telephone 
interview from washington in terms of which side got more i 
think we did very well 
diane cossin a spokeswoman for acting us attorney dexter 
lehtinen said were pleased that theyre pleased were not 
getting the whole pie here but were not unhappy 
classified information belonging to any federal agency that 
deals with national security as well as information from noriegas 
private dealings with more than 20 foreign governments must first 
be reviewed by the justice departments court security officer 
before it can be introduced as evidence hoeveler said 
information in books newspapers and other publications are 
similarly restricted if the published reports include confirmation 
by someone with access to classified information and if the justice 
department believes it could affect national security hoeveler 
ruled 
but hoeveler denied several key restrictions sought by the 
government including a demand that defense attorneys immediately 
submit to prosecutors as well as the neutral court security 
officer any sensitive evidence they plan to introduce at trial 
the judge also refused prosecutors requests for a lifetime gag 
order that would have forced anyone given access to classified 
documents to get prior approval from intelligence agencies before 
speaking about that information 
prosecutors were seeking a protective order that was far more 
restrictive than anything ever seen before judge hoeveler in all 
respects denied those problematic requests lewis said 
the order also restricts the defense attorneys for noriega and 
his codefendants from sharing information without prior approval 
from the government 
that stipulation lewis said would have little impact because 
noriega is the only defendant intending to use classified 
information at this point 
also tuesday hoeveler released daniel miranda a pilot accused 
in the noriega indictment of flying drug profits to panama on 1 
million bond 
miranda 36 is the second of the six defendants taken into 
custody to be released on bond brian alden davidow a miamiarea 
resident turned himself in to federal authorities immediately 
after the february 1988 indictment was handed up and has been free 
since then 
still jailed are noriega aide luis del cid who has been 
negotiating a plea bargain accused colombian cocaine trafficker 
william saldarriaga eduardo pardo and noriega ten other 
defendants are still at large 
noriega who is accused of accepting bribes from colombian 
cocaine traffickers and turning his country into a conduit for 
drugs smuggled into the united states was flown from panama on 
jan 4 following the us invasion

former president jimmy carter arrived in 
syria today and said he expected to discuss the plight of foreign 
hostages in lebanon when he meets with president hafez assad 
its obvious to me that the syrian leaders are very eager to 
see the hostage question solved and so see the hostages released 
carter told reporters on arrival at damascus international airport 
the former president who arrived from egypt was due to meet 
assad and other officials before continuing his tour with visits to 
jordan and israel 
foreign minister farouk alsharaa who greeted carter said he 
was not pessimistic about freeing hostages in lebanon as we 
did exert a lot of efforts in the past to gain the release of so 
many hostages we are still continuing to exert such intensive 
efforts sharaa said 
syria with roughly 40000 troops in lebanon is the main power 
broker in that warravaged country but most of the hostages are 
believed to be held by groups influenced by iran and often at odds 
with syria 
recent statements by some iranian leaders urging freedom for the 
hostages had raised hopes that a release might be imminent but a 
hardline iranian figure former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi recently denounced calls for the hostages to be freed 
those statements are equivocal carter said referring to 
comments by iranian leaders one day its a positive statement 
the next day its a rejection of a positive statement 
but i dont think theres any doubt that the leaders of iran 
have a great influence on the future of the hostages he added 
diplomats and syrian officials in damascus have said in recent 
days that there are few signs that a release is imminent 
eighteen foreigners including eight americans were taken 
hostage in lebanon the longest held is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who will have 
been held five years on friday 
carter who is on a private tour of the middle east leaves 
syria for jordan on friday since he left office in 1979 carter 
has visited the middle east four times monitoring peace efforts 
in talks in atlanta and in africa he also has mediated 
conflicts between the sudanese and ethiopian governments and rebels 
waging war against them 
carter who sponsored the 1978 camp david talks that led to 
israeliegyptian peace said he also was using his current trip to 
the middle east to explore prospects for a final end to 
arabisraeli hostilities 
we hope for a comprehensive settlement of all the issues 
including that between syria and israel in the future he said 
carter said a proposed dialogue between israelis and 
palestinians that has split the israeli government would be a 
precedentsetting first step which we hope would lead to even 
broader agreements in the future 
israels coalition government collapsed tuesday in a dispute 
over what sort of palestinians israel should agree to talk with 
carter told reporters in egypt he thought there is still a 
good chance for dialogue especially if a government led by 
one faction rather than a deadlocked coalition of leftist labor 
or hardline likud is formed 
carter also supported president bushs opposition to settlement 
of soviet jews in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
sharaa expressed arab concerns that the hundreds of thousands of 
soviet jews expected by israel would displace palestinians from 
their homeland and make the return of palestinian refugees to their 
homes impossible he opposed emigration even to israel itself 
the soviet jews can go anywhere in the world but not to 
palestine because the human rights of the palestinian people of 
the arabs under occupation should be given priority he said 
there are millions of palestinians outside their country 
there are thousands of syrians outside of the golan heights and 
there are thousands of lebanese outside the south of lebanon 
and all these are deprived of the right to return to their 
homes and property by israel sharaa added 
israel seized syrias golan heights in the 1967 middle east war 
and later annexed it in 1985 israel created a security zone 
in southern lebanon to protect its northern borders from attacks by 
arab guerrillas

afghanistan will destroy its huge 
stockpiles of sovietsupplied weapons if the united states and 
other countries stop supporting the moslem rebels the foreign 
minister said today 
the minister abdul wakil said the rebels also should destroy 
their stockpiles 
previously the administration had called only for a halt in 
military supplies to both the rebels and the sovietbacked 
government in afghanistans 12yearold civil war the offer to 
destroy the stockpiles could eventually help pave the way for peace 
talks on afghanistan 
wakil made the announcement one week after forces loyal to 
president najib crushed a coup attempt led by thendefense minister 
shah nawaz tanai 
the soviet news agency tass reported today that 200 civilians 
died and 500 were wounded in the failed coup the kabul government 
has said 95 civilians died and 197 were wounded no military 
casualties have been released 
on tuesday a spokesman for the kabul government reported the 
moslem guerrillas attacked the strategic southern city of khost and 
also were fighting government forces around eastern jalalabad 
another key city 
since the coup attempt soviet aid to najibs government has 
increased more than 30 transport planes carrying 25 tons of 
weapons and medicine each land daily at kabuls airport eastern 
european diplomats said 
in addition the government said tuesday that 4200 tons of 
goods from the soviet union reached kabul by land in the last three 
days 
wakil lashed out at pakistan today accusing the neighboring 
moslem nation of masterminding the coup attempt pakistan 
which allows the afghan rebels to operate from its territory has 
denied similar charges by kabul officials in the past 
in a statement apparently released tuesday by tanai in pakistan 
the former defense minister said he was planning to unite with the 
guerrillas to topple najib who was installed as president by the 
soviets in 1986 
soviet troops invaded afghanistan in december 1979 and pulled 
out under a unbrokered agreement in 1989 
tanai a hardline communist is generally considered 
responsible for afghanistans successful defense of jalalabad 
against the guerrilla attacks that followed the soviet withdrawal 
in february 1989 
wakils statement on kabuls willingness to eliminate its 
stockpiles of arms would apparently remove a stumbling block in 
negotiations over ending the war in afghanistan 
during the soviet occupation the country amassed huge 
stockpiles of weapons including thousands of trucks tanks 
armored personnel carriers bombs missiles and guns 
since the red armys withdrawal western analysts said moscows 
military assistance has been about 300 million a month including 
an estimated 1000 scud missiles 
in negotiations last year the united states rejected a soviet 
proposal for each superpower to stop military aid to their allies 
in the civil war the united states objected because the proposal 
would have allowed the communist government in kabul to keep 
existing stockpiles of weapons 
washington also opposed the plan because at that time us 
analysts believed kabul would fall quickly to the usbacked 
rebels

a recall election narrowly retained the 
mayor who led an unsuccessful campaign to ban fur sales but ousted 
one of his council supporters 
mayor bill stirling held onto his seat tuesday with 1227 voting 
to keep him in office and 1097 favoring a recall 
he interpreted the results as support of his efforts to limit a 
feeding frenzy of greedy developers 
what people want he said is to slow down not halt but 
slow down speculative development and really get going with 
affordable housing typical singlefamily house prices in the 
fashionable resort a favorite skiing spot for celebrities surpass 
1 million 
voters last month rejected stirlings ballot proposal to ban the 
sale of furs in aspen as well as another measure to limit the size 
of a ritzcarlton hotel under construction 
those hoping to oust a majority of the fivemember council 
accused the recall targets of being rude and unresponsive to 
constituents concerns 
councilman michael gassman kept his seat with a 1347 to 965 
vote councilman frank peters was retained by a margin of just 30 
votes 1142 to 1112 
residents recalled councilman steve crockett by a 1288 to 1025 
margin in favor of margot pendleton a concrete contractor 
crocketts critics considered him too confrontational 
the turnout was more than 60 percent despite heavy snow and 
good skiing conditions 
i think that people reacted to the very negative approach that 
was taken by the prorecall people in their campaign and i think 
people got a little tired of it stirling said late tuesday 
many voters told pollsters from the aspen times daily they 
retained the incumbents because they disapproved of the recall 
campaign 
its just been unfair said 23yearold aspen resident ellen 
marshall all the council has done is carry out the mandate they 
were given when they were elected this whole thing is sad 
some longtime residents believe aspen has lost its soul in 
becoming a playground for the rich and famous but recall 
supporters said efforts to save aspen by limiting growth have 
become exclusionary and nasty 
aspens population is said to peak at about 20000 in the 
winter it has about 3700 registered voters many property owners 
do not live here full time and real estate prices have skyrocketed 
during the past decade 
aspen home to eccentrics like gonzo journalist hunter s 
thompson was the first us community to pass a tough antismoking 
ordinance and the first to declare itself a nuclearfree zone

the vatican today restored the leadership of 
the longpersecuted roman catholic church in romania and revived 
the eastern rite branch that was suppressed there more than 40 
years ago 
pope john paul ii appointed 12 bishops to restore the strength 
the church enjoyed before a crackdown on religion began in 1948 
it marked the biggest step forward by the vatican in eastern 
europe since the former hardline regimes began to crumble last 
year 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the church was 
overjoyed by the moves in romania and hinted that a restoration 
of diplomatic relations with bucharest cut by the communists in 
1950 was not far off 
romanian clergy have also invited the pope to visit the country 
but navarro said no date has been fixed 
the appointments were made possible by the actions of romanian 
authorities in january suspending 1948 decrees that sharply 
curtailed the freedom of roman catholics and forcibly incorporated 
the eastern or byzantine rite catholic church into the orthodox 
church 
their 1800 churches were confiscated and bishops and priests 
who refused to accept the merger were jailed a situation similar 
to that in the ukraine 
in recent days vatican officials have been in the soviet union 
to negotiate with soviet and orthodox church authorities on the 
revival of the ukrainian catholic church 
but there has been no action taken yet on a law guaranteeing 
freedom of religion which would legalize the ukrainian catholic 
church and was promised by president mikhail s gorbachev when he 
met with the pope here in december 
two of the new eastern rite bishops in romania are in their late 
70s or past the normal vatican retirement age navarro said the 
nominations were in recognition for their suffering for the church 
both had been imprisoned for years and one of them bishop 
alexander todea 77 of alba julia had been sentenced to death in 
1951 and freed in a 1964 amnesty 
all had practiced their religion underground in what the vatican 
calls the catacomb church 
the vatican estimates there are 28 million catholics from the 
two rites in romania 
the nominations restore the roman and eastern rite churches in 
romania to their pre1948 strength of six and five bishops 
respectively before today only two roman dioceses were headed by 
bishops 
navarro stressed the nominations were made independently by the 
pope with no interference by the romanian government 
over the past year the vatican has reestablished diplomatic 
relations with poland and hungary 
last month the pope also finished restoring the church in 
czechoslovakia to full strength for the first time since world war 
ii but that was carried out over a period of time and not on a 
single day as in romania 
the pope is scheduled to visit czechoslovakia next month 
while there is no immediate move for the vatican and bucharest 
to reestablish full relations navarro said the romanian 
govbernment is returning the embassy building confiscated 40 years 
ago 
still to be resolved is the issue of religious orders which 
were banned in romania in 1948 and all their property seized

shiite moslem militia allies of syria and 
iran fought each other in the streets of south beirut today a few 
blocks away from where most of the western hostages are believed 
held captive 
police today also reported intermittent gunfire between rival 
christian militias in east beirut 
clashes broke out early in the day between the proiranian 
hezbollah and the syrianbacked amal militia in the slums of south 
beirut said a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations 
police said three people were killed and 10 wounded before 
syrian soldiers intervened and disengaged the combatants around 1 
pm that brought the overall toll to seven killed and 34 wounded 
since the amalhezbollah clashes broke out tuesday evening 
fighters of the two warring moslem factions fired automatic 
rifles and rocketpropelled grenades across the narrow streets 
separating their positions the spokesman said 
the fighting was reported in the shiyah ouzai and bir hassan 
districts a few blocks west of hezbollahs hajjaj and hay madi 
barracks where most of the 18 western hostages are believed held 
eight of the hostages are american the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was abducted march 16 1985 
staccato bursts of machinegun fire accompanied by grenade 
explosions echoed across moslem west beirut as bearded amal and 
hezbollah fighters traded fire 
motorists honked horns hysterically and sped away in all 
directions to escape the confrontations hundreds of worried 
parents fearing the possible spread of fighting rushed to schools 
to take their children home 
amal in a communique blamed the escalation on mohtashemis 
followers in the socalled hezbollah 
amal claims hezbollahs leader sheik sobhi tofeili supports 
former iranian interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi a hardliner 
who was ousted as government minister by president hashemi 
rafsanjani in august 
mohtashemi opposes releasing the western hostages and reaffirmed 
that line in a virulent editorial published in a radical tehran 
newspaper saturday he also opposes rafsanjanis moves to improve 
relations with the west 
the lebanese shiite mufti or supreme religious judge sheik 
abdul amir qabalan also blamed the intrashiite confrontation on 
hezbollah 
the police spokesman said amal and hezbollah fighters erected 
several checkpoints in their respective areas of influence and were 
checking identity cards and kidnapping each others followers 
the two militias have been battling for more than two years for 
mastery of the 12 million shiites who make up the largest 
community in lebanon which has a population of 4 million 
by police count more than 1030 people were killed and 3046 
wounded in previous amalhezbollah battles 
in another violent development police said one person was 
killed and two wounded in an intermittent exchange of sniper fire 
between rival christian forces in east beirut overnight 
that raised the overall toll to 757 killed and 2106 wounded in 
the intrachristian fighting since jan 30 when clashes broke out 
between renegade gen michel aouns troops and fighters of samir 
geageas lebanese forces militia 
the two forces fighting for dominance of the 310squaremile 
christian enclave accused each other of blocking efforts by a 
christian mediation committee to work out a settlement to their 
bloody dispute 
the dispute has developed into the worst confrontation among 
christians in the nations 15yearold civil war

business inventories edged up 02 percent in 
january the government said today but were offset by a 03 
percent gain in business sales 
the commerce department said inventories rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 7959 billion after falling a revised 04 percent in 
december 
the december drop originally reported to be 02 percent was 
the first since a 01 percent decline in october 1988 and the 
largest since a 06 percent fall in december 1986 
business sales meanwhile rose to a seasonally adjusted 5230 
billion after falling a revised 02 percent in december december 
sales originally were reported to be unchanged from november 
the january business activity produced a 152 ratio of 
inventories to sales the same as in december that means that it 
would take 152 months to exhaust inventories at the january pace 
the ratio was 153 in both october and november 
inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as 
output exceeds demand if they were to pile up excessively it 
could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs 
however economists do not feel the ratio is at a dangerous 
level 
retail backlogs fell 06 percent in january while sales rose 
28 percent 
part of the improvement in retail inventories came as automobile 
companies temporarily laid off thousands of workers during the 
month to trim the number of motor vehicles stuck on backlots auto 
inventories dropped 36 percent 
manufacturing inventories rose 07 percent while sales dropped 
19 percent 
wholesalers inventories edged up 02 percent while their sales 
gained 14 percent

for michael graf the brief and 
seemingly anarchic east german election campaign is too much too 
soon 
nobody knows quite what to think the burly 20yearold 
toolmaker says over a beer in this cheerless decaying industrial 
town everything happened a bit too quickly 
half a year after the first wave of protests started in leipzig 
many east germans are bewildered by the need to choose among 24 
slates of candidates in sundays election thousands of contenders 
are running for spots in the 400seat parliament 
a recent west german poll said a quarter of the 123 million 
voters are undecided in this country of about 16 million people 
new groups are facing formidable obstacles in campaigning the 
renamed communists try to blend into the democratic landscape 
stressing their defense of east germanys cradletograve social 
safety net graf says he has trouble deciding what the parties 
stand for 
well know what we have voted for only after the elections 
graf says 
and with noncommunist parties getting massive aid from their 
west german counterparts the choices for east german voters is not 
entirely homegrown 
as far as im concerned these parties are being directed from 
the other side graf says 
the choices include the conservative alliance for germany the 
leftofcenter social democrats and even several radical leftist 
splinter groups west germanys extreme right which had hoped to 
field candidates was barred from the campaign 
opposition activists say the country was not ready for a 
westernstyle campaign and worry openly that unity in opposing the 
communists has turned to political polarization 
campaign posters of all parties are being torn down and papered 
over by rivals at an increasingly frantic pace as sundays vote 
nears vandalism against party offices has been reported in several 
places a leading conservative politician wolfgang schnur 
resigned after admitting he was a secret police informer 
social democratic party chairman ibrahim boehme is sleeping in a 
different bed every night on the advice of security experts the 
west german news magazine der spiegel reported 
but apart from some defaced posters election fever seems muted 
in eberswalde about 37 miles northeast of berlin with a population 
of 45000 
as elsewhere in east germany the lack of big commercial 
advertising spaces precludes campaign publicity on a western scale 
local opposition activists say citizens are only slowly 
accepting that they should control who governs them not vice versa 
our biggest problem is that people continue to think in old 
terms they say just let those up there do the work says 
bernd christmann of the new but increasingly important social 
democrats 
its sad but true the prussian mentality has survived that 
sense of duty and subservience to the pressure of authorities 
adds andreas kriesten a 36yearold protestant minister heading 
the local office of the christian democratic union the formerly 
communistaligned christian democrats are in a threeparty 
conservative election alliance 
earlier euphoria about the promise of prosperity through 
unification with west germany seems to be fading worries are rife 
about the future of the statecoddled economy and social services 
now that west german firms are storming to convert their eastern 
neighbor to capitalism 
several hundred citizens have come to seek information since the 
social democrats opened a shabby tworoom office on eberswaldes 
main thoroughfare six weeks ago 
they ask about social security their jobs kindergarten 
school lunches christmann says 
steffen joswig grafs drinking buddy says he shares those 
worries at the same time the 32yearold waiter doesnt want to 
risk seeking a new life in west germany with his wife and three 
children 
i dont know who ill vote for but definitely not the pds 
communists he says 
all my friends have gone over graf adds but im waiting 
for the elections im not winding up in a refugee camp in west 
germany 
polls suggest that neither the social democrats nor the 
conservative alliance will gain a parliamentary majority thus 
forcing a national unity government that probably would be another 
transitional solution 
the campaign has been even shorter than originally planned 
opposition groups and the government agreed to move up the planned 
may 6 balloting when east germany threatened to sink into political 
chaos in january 
despite the current uncertainties campaign posters saying 
socialism never again bear witness to the fundamental change 
since hardline communist boss erich honecker was ousted oct 18

north korea agreed today to participate 
in a joint investigation of what us and south korean engineers 
said was an invasion tunnel dug under the border separating the 
two nations 
us and south korean officials said they were surprised by 
north koreas apparent willingness to accept a proposal by the 
usled united nations command for an investigation the last time 
the two nations jointly investigated a border incident was in 1967 
at a meeting of the korean military armistice commission at this 
truce village north korean delegate maj gen choi ui ung denied 
his nation dug the tunnel and agreed to promptly conduct a 
comprehensive and scientific joint investigation of the socalled 
tunnel which you allegedly have found 
choi said he would send a 60member inspection team made up of 
experts and journalists to the tunnel site via helicopter 
adm larry g vogt the senior us delegate at the armistice 
meeting said the offer was an encouraging sign and we will 
consider it 
but choi declared a late reply would mean the rejection of his 
nations acceptance of the joint investigation 
the north korean general demanded an immediate investigation 
but vogt said the proposal lacked the necessary details and 
procedures required under the 1953 korean armistice agreement 
united nations command officials said procedures do not allow 
either side to send a large delegation across the border by 
helicopter they also noted that the north korean proposal was 
unclear as to whether it would allow south korea equal 
participation in the probe 
one united nations command official said his organization would 
make a counterproposal that fits the framework of the armistice 
agreement 
the tunnel was discovered on march 3 in a remote mountainous 
area along the 155mile border 
it was the fourth tunnel found since 1974 and was about two 
yards high and two yards wide large enough for three armed 
soldiers to run through abreast south korean officials said a 
regiment could pass through in an hour 
it has not been clear when the tunnel was built north korea 
denied building tunnels beneath the border that were found in 1974 
1975 and 1978 and suggested they were old mining tunnels 
meanwhile in seoul 13 radicals protesting joint ussouth 
korean military exercises were arrested by police after they pushed 
their way inside a gate at the headquarters of the us 8th army 
there was no damage to the us facility and no injuries police 
said 
north korea has demanded cancelation of the exercises now under 
way 
in the central city of taejon police fired tear gas to break up 
a demonstration of about 300 students who were march to nearby 
chungnam university throwing firebombs and shouting yankee go 
home 
the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 at the end of world war 
ii capitalist south korea and communist north korea fought a 
bloody threeyear war in the early 1950s and remain bitter enemies

jerusalems mayor said today that president bush 
has written to him promising that the united states supports a 
united jerusalem 
jerusalem must never again be a divided city bush wrote in 
a march 13 letter to mayor teddy kollek and distributed at a news 
conference here kollek also distributed the letter he wrote to 
bush on march 8 
bush warned against steps that could prejudice the prospects 
for arabisraeli negotiations on jerusalems future but wrote 
nothing about jewish settlement in the arab eastern sector of the 
city captured by israel in the 1967 war 
last week bush made a statement apparently lumping east 
jerusalem which israel regards as its sovereign territory with 
the west bank which is under israeli military occupation israel 
strongly objected saying jerusalem was a separate issue 
asked at a news conference at the israeli embassy whether he 
believed bushs letter canceled the presidents earlier statement 
kollek said that is my strong impression 
bushs letter however merely expresses support for the us 
policy since 1967 which has been in favor of a united jerusalem 
bush wrote it is also our view that the final status of this 
most special of cities should be decided by negotiation and that 
this negotiation would be facilitated if we were well along the 
path toward peace there is thus no intention on our part to focus 
now on the final status of jerusalem

west german chancellor helmut kohl has 
assured nervous east germans that their savings will be converted 
onetoone into hard west german marks in a reunified germany 
east german citizens currently get only about 016 west german 
marks for their currency at a western bank a 61 ratio reflecting 
the relative weakness of the east german economy 
kohls promise tuesday night during a campaign visit appeared 
timed to rally support for a conservative threeparty alliance 
competing in east germanys free elections sunday 
the alliance is heavily backed by kohls christian democratic 
union in bonn it is facing a challenge from the revamped communist 
party campaigning on the idea that east germanys social safety 
net and full employment are endangered by a hasty takeover by west 
german capitalists 
kohls promise is no guarantee because the currency plan would 
require formal approval by his coalition government and the assent 
of the west german central bank in addition details of the 
planned unification still have to be negotiated by the two germanys 
kohls government is pushing for merging the weak east german 
mark with its west german counterpart one of the worlds strongest 
currencies 
among the thorniest issues in the proposed monetary union which 
would be a prerequisite for full unity is how to treat east german 
savings many east germans like their counterparts in other soviet 
bloc nations have compiled large savings because there have been 
few consumer goods to buy 
kohls assurance echoed similar statements by members of his 
government 
in his speech in cottbus east germany he also reiterated a 
call for speedy movement toward unity under article 23 of the west 
german constitution the clause allows individual east german 
states to decide to join west germany

an eastern airlines dc9 forced to make a 
highspeed emergency landing because of a hydraulic system failure 
blew all four main landing gear tires and slid off a runway in a 
shower of sparks 
no injuries were reported in the landing at hartsfield atlanta 
international airport 
airport spokesman john braden said eastern flight 129 returned 
to the airport for the emergency landing about 1050 pm tuesday 
after taking off on a flight to tallahassee fla 
because the jet landed well above normal speed its four 
main tires two under each wing blew and the aircraft skidded 
off the runway in a shower of sparks said eastern spokesman jim 
ashlock 
we probably wouldnt have had any situation at all if he 
hadnt blown those tires he said 
the landing was at a higherthannormal speed because the 
hydraulic failure left the dc9 without flaps which are used to 
slow the plane during descent ashlock said 
braden said the sparks were caused by the landing gear scraping 
the runway and there was no fire emergency crews and fire trucks 
lined the runway but they did not lay down firesuppressing foam 
before the landing 
the airplane carried 49 passengers and five crew members 
ashlock said 
the landing was kind of bumpy and then it was eerie said 
passenger rusty nunn of hopkinsville ky of course everyone was 
nervous but they remained calm 
ashlock said the plane was 25 minutes into its 35minute flight 
but the pilot elected to return to atlanta because of its longer 
runways and better emergency equipment 
braden said the federal aviation administration and the national 
transportation safety board would investigate

vice president dan quayle suggested today 
the bush administration might consider a loan to argentina once the 
country concludes negotiations to meet economic progress conditions 
set by the international monetary fund 
quayle also said during a news conference that president bush 
may visit argentina next fall there is a very serious 
consideration being given to such a visit he said 
the imf appoved a 14 billion loan to argentina last september 
but has held up disbursement of the money because president carlos 
menem did not meet targets on controlling inflation and reducing 
the budget deficit 
i communicated to president menem and others that the united 
states will be full partners in the development of argentina and 
other countries in the western hemisphere quayle said 
the vice president was asked about persistent rumors that the 
united states is considering a 400 million bridge loan for 
argentina 
before we discuss the bridge loan there would have to be a 
bridge to something that something is the conclusion of the imf 
financial arrangement we did talk in very specific terms about 
concluding the imf package i believe that the government of 
argentina and the imf are quite close on this and we hope that it 
would be resolved very soon quayle said 
quayle left for brazil where he will attend the inauguration on 
thursday of president fernando collor de mello after meeting with 
argentine business leaders and laying a wreath at the statue of 
jose de san martin who led the independence struggles of 
argentina peru and chile 
menem and quayle also talked about cuba and menem said he would 
try to press president fidel castro into making democratic reforms 
in his marxist nation castro will attend the inauguration in 
brazil 
were not going to meet with castro in brazil quayle told 
reporters i have no desire to meet with fidel castro castro 
remains isolated i had talks with the other leaders presidents of 
this hemisphere and they have conveyed to me the sense of 
isolation that fidel castro now finds himself in castro must back 
change and sooner or later change will come to cuba i am 
convinced of that 
quayle asked menem to also try to get castro to halt arms 
shipments to the leftist rebels in el salvador the rebels have the 
strongest insurgent movement in latin america and are waging war 
on the usbacked government of alfredo cristiani 
us officials said earlier that quayle was encouraging menem to 
take severe austerity measures to curb surging inflation but was 
offering no aid 
menem told quayle on tuesday that he was putting teeth in his 
vow to make economic reforms and restore his countrys credibility 
internationally said one quayle aide who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity argentina has been experiencing inflation 
of about 70 percent a month 
since taking office last july menem has lifted controls on 
wages prices foreign exchange and investment he has reduced the 
fiscal budget partly deregulated the oil industry lowered import 
tariffs and pledged to sell a string of moneylosing companies 
however the measures have failed to control the inflation that 
has bedeviled the country registering triple digits in 14 of the 
past 15 years 
he has to cut government he has to fire government employees 
he needs to do what he says he will do said one us official 
traveling with quayle 
the countrys economic straits including shrinking of real 
wages by as much as 50 percent in the past year have prompted 
looting of food stores strikes against national banks an ongoing 
teacher strike and a strike by clerks that disrupted the federal 
court system

the man who led a 13month interim 
government after the us invasion of 1983 emerged today as 
grenadas likely new prime minister after parliamentary elections 
nicholas brathwaites centrist national democratic congress fell 
one seat short of a legislative majority in tuesdays balloting 
but most observers expected him to be able to persuade at least one 
legislator to switch to his party to form a government 
we have a situation where there will have to be negotiations 
which i would have preferred not to have brathwaite 64 said 
early today but at the same time i think it is not a difficult 
situation 
complete but unofficial results gave the national democratic 
congress seven of the 15 seats in the house of representatives 
grenadas parliament 
with one more seat brathwaite would have an eightseat majority 
and he held talks early today with other legislators about 
switching to his party 
the grenada united labor party of sir eric gairy the eccentric 
former prime minister deposed in a leftist coup in 1979 was second 
with four seats 
gairy 68 who dominated grenadas politics for nearly three 
decades before his ouster lost his bid for a parliamentary seat 
but his party with the second most legislators will likely form 
the official opposition and he could still play a role behind the 
scenes 
the national party of acting prime minister ben jones and the 
new national party led by keith mitchell a former cabinet 
minister won two seats each jones and mitchell were both returned 
to parliament 
the leftist maurice bishop patriotic movement failed to gain any 
parliamentary seats 
radio grenada said the results were complete but unofficial 
official results along with the popular vote totals were to be 
announced later today 
it was the second election since us troops along with a token 
regional force invaded the tiny caribbean island and toppled a 
marxist junta and there had been concern over the possible 
destabilizing effect of a gairy victory 
gairy the first prime minister after independence from britain 
in 1974 has been dogged by allegations of corruption and 
repression throughout his career as early as 1961 britain 
dissolved his preindependence government because of allegations of 
financial irregularities 
though nearly blind with glaucoma gairy had spoken of the 
possibility of a miracle cure and had declared his campaign 
divinely inspired 
the election happened to fall on the 11th anniversary of the 
marxist coup that toppled gairys authoritarian regime and brought 
to power bishops peoples revolutionary government 
bishop and 10 others were assassinated oct 19 1983 following a 
split in his government six days later the usled invasion 
force landed and evicted the junta that had seized power us 
officials said the invasion was necessary to protect american lives 
and prevent grenada from becoming a staging post for communist 
aggression in the region 
brathwaite an educator with no political experience at the 
time was called on to head the government during the 13month 
period between the invasion and the election in december 1984 
before the last election the reagan administration pressured 
three centrist parties to merge into the new national party led by 
the late prime minister herbert blaize mainly to block gairy 
blaize won 14 seats but the piecemeal party had disintegrated by 
the time of his death in december at the age of 71

month training and counseling program partly to answer criticism 
that the organization was warehousing rather than counseling 
runaways

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
march 9 
statesman journal salem ore on the bush transportation plan 
when candidate george bush said read my lips no new 
taxes we didnt know exactly what he meant as president george 
bush he has spelled it out hell pass federal duties on to local 
governments and let them pay the bill and raise the taxes 
thats what he and congress already have done with education and 
health care and its what he proposes in his new moving america 
into the 21st century plan for our transportation system 
the federal government would continue paying the costs for 
interstate and many major highways but it would give states and 
local governments the bill for building and maintaining millions of 
miles of other highways and it would impose extensive user fees 
for motorists truckers air travelers and mass transit customers 
this is a tax increase by another name its a tax increase that 
local governments cannot pay and probably should not have to pay 
for a transportation system that is national in scope 
at the least washington should deal with us honestly if our 
crumbling and clogged highways are a national problem remedy it 
with a national program and admit that federal taxes must be 
increased or that other programs must be cut back to save the 
money

the providence ri journalbulletin on the bush 
transportation plan 
as many travelers know parts of americas transportation 
network have fallen on hard times many highways and bridges are 
crumbling under heavy traffic major airports are choked with 
congestion passenger rail service is scattered and spotty and 
urban mass transit is often a joke 
the bush administration has dug bravely into this thicket of 
problems its new transportation policy represents a sharp 
departure from past practice it seeks essentially to shrink the 
federal role in everything from highway maintenance to mass transit 
operations and to transfer many costs to state and local 
governments 
in a nation the size of the united states transportation is a 
national concern deserving national treatment it is by no means 
assured that transferring large pieces of this responsibility to 
local governments is the best way to restore our battered system to 
health

los angeles times on the rostenkowski deficit reduction plan 
for most americans the national debt is as abstract as the 
numbers that measure it currently about 3000000000000 as in 
trillion 
getting washington to focus again on the debt is only one reason 
to cheer rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways 
and means committe for his bold plan to slash the federal budget 
deficit 
the more than 150 billion a year that vanishes into interest 
payments means that there is much less money in circulation for 
private investment and in turn economic expansion and job 
creation this debt is of increasing consequence as the economy 
slows down because it severely cuts the nations ability to bail 
itself out of a severe recession 
rostenkowskis plan would not wipe out the national debt but 
would keep it from growing after 1994 
where would the money come from a oneyear freeze on 
costofliving increases in all federal programs would cut the 
deficit by 9 percent the first year higher taxes on oil tobacco 
alcohol and industrial pollutants would cut it another 20 billion 
cutting the pentagon budget by 3 percent a year would convert 
another 10 billion from red ink to black families with incomes 
above 185000 a year who now pay income taxes as a 28 percent 
rate would pay the same 33 percent that families with smaller 
incomes pay 
the white house and some republican leaders in congress 
resisted any temptation to attack the plan that plus renewed 
attention to the deficit is an improvement over recent behavior on 
all sides

kennebec journal augusta maine on clean air legislation 
twenty years after the clean air act was first passed the 
senate majority leader george mitchell has clinched a deal to 
overhaul and strengthen it 
following 12 days of closeddoor meetings mitchell unveiled a 
compromise which the bush administration supports business is 
grumbling about and some environmental groups are wild about in 
the most purple prose mitchell is said to have gutted the bill 
thats nonsense mitchell knows that after a decade of inaction 
begun with the inauguration of ronald trees cause pollution 
reagan the nation has got to get a new clean air bill on the books 
to be sure there are disappointments pollution reduction 
techniques for cars and trucks contributing perhaps half of all 
ozone pollution are highly developed but the technology has not 
been used sufficiently thanks largely to reagan this time out 
bushs proposal for alternative fuel vehicles was cut as were the 
most stringent tailpipe standards 
on the other hand the acid rainfighting measures cracking 
down on high sulfur coal burning in the midwest are mostly intact 
the most punitive sanctions for cities exceeding federal pollution 
standards shutting down all development arent going to be used 
anyway so their loss is mostly symbolic 
all in all mitchell has done well any comparison with the 
clean air acts of 1970 and 1990 shows some major improvements long 
overdue mitchells critics ought to remember that the deadlock of 
reagan years where a president stubbornly refused to acknowledge 
scientific reality is unlikely to recur if this doesnt work the 
law can be changed again but its still a big step forward the 
first in a long long time

the santa fe nm new mexican on the clean air bill 
the new clean air act has finally come to the floor of the us 
senate but the legislation is like the senior prom a lot of 
people are unhappy with their date expectations were too high and 
now everyones got some gripe with the bill 
its true that in a perfect world the bill would be tougher with 
respect to cleaning up urban smog and laying the groundwork for 
reducing air pollution health hazards of the future but we dont 
live in a perfect world and compromise is the order of the day in 
congress 
the bill nonetheless requires cuts in harmful sulfur dioxide 
emissions by 10 million tons by the year 2000 and caps emissions 
thereafter it also requires tough new smog standards focusing on 
automobile emission controls unfortunately its alternative fuel 
provisions are weaker than they ought to be resulting from bush 
administration backpedaling its possible this can be strengthened 
with amendments on the senate floor 
but whatever its flaws the overall concept of this legislation 
is a major step forward it should be passed so the real work can 
begin holding it up is like holding your breath in the end 
youve got to breathe the air and it will be better with the 
compromise legislation than without it

st cloud minn times on the defense budget 
theres a lot of talk in these post cold war days about a 
socalled peace dividend the politicians and special interest 
groups are lined up waiting to claim the money they believe should 
be diverted from the us defense budget 
certainly the bush administration and congress would be wise to 
consider the possibility of cutting military expenditures in some 
ares especially if arms control talks between the two superpowers 
continue to move ahead 
but a wholesale slash in us military personnel equipment and 
maintenance would be folly even if reforms that have swept across 
eastern europe and the soviet union continue even if central 
american nations carry off their precarious conversions to 
democracy even if worldwide relations are comfortably stable even 
when peace reigns this country needs a strong military 
the dividends of peace can be realized without making rash 
reductions in personnel and equipment they can be found instead 
in conversion defense secretary dick cheney undoubtedly a man 
driven these days by a need to justify his departments strength 
has the right idea two weeks ago the pentagon announced a 
significant expansion in use of warships aircraft and 
communications equipment against what many americans consider their 
greatest enemy illegal drugs 
the move is an example of how americans military power can be 
put to nontraditional uses adjusting priorities is wiser than 
eradicating large hunks of our defense at least at this point

the news and observer raleigh nc on the national guard and 
drugs 
when the national guard is called out to protect and assist 
the citizenry it bolsters law enforcement and the publics 
feeling that all is under control but the planned involvement of 
the guard in the drug war in searching air and sea cargo and in 
riding with local law enforcement officers goes too far 
it follows unfortunately the mentality of too many leaders in 
the antidrug fight that the fight is to be won on some 
figurative battlefield with muscle and bullets and prisons instead 
of in the classroom and the treatment ward under that mentality 
the right of citizens to be free of unreasonable searches for 
example already is under strain how much more intimidating would 
the authorities conducting those searches be if backed by the 
firepower of the guard 
ostensibly the guard is only to assist civilian law enforcement 
agencies helping customs inspectors with cargo searches 
theres a fine line however between lowkey assistance and a 
highprofile strong arm 
the stresses of combat for which the guard does train people 
are different from those that arise in maintaining law and order in 
a community the national guard cannot and should not train people 
for both possibilities in the drug war the guards place is not 
on the front lines

the phoenix gazette on the postal service 
in recent years the us postal service has eliminated sunday 
mail sorting slashed window hours at local post offices and most 
recently cut back on oneday delivery 
having thus been blessed by a reduction in services the 
american people can now look forward to another increase in prices 
postmaster general anthony frank announced that a 30cent stamp 
seems likely for firstclass mail next year 
unfortunately the postal service has a governmentsanctioned 
monopoly over daily mail delivery when forced to compete the 
postal service has been clobbered by the competition 
consumers voted with their parcels when united parcel service 
got into the parcel business the postal service now carries less 
than 10 percent of all parcels shipped by the public the same is 
true for express mail the postal services share of 
overnightdelivery mail has declined to less than 10 percent 
the postal service managed to operate about 404 million in the 
black for the first quarter of this fiscal year but the agency 
expects a record 16 billion deficit for the full year ending 
sept 30 
the postal service claims that it has to preserve its monopoly 
so that it can be a public service but being a monopoly 
destroys the service incentive

the news and courier charleston sc on the soviet union 
mikhail gorbachev never has been unwilling to take the plunge 
to a market economy principally because of his desire to seek 
marxistleninist answers to the countrys ills 
but the recent explosions of ethnic and regional animosities in 
azerbaijan armenia and turkistan and the growing separatist 
movements in the baltic republics of estonia latvia and lithuania 
have served only to make gorbachev even more reluctant to bite 
the bullet and embrace market solutions 
as a result shortages of every conceivable item from food to 
fuel have become more severe there are simply too many rubles 
chasing too few goods at fixed artificial prices and the result is 
a populace that is hungry angry and increasingly alienated by 
gorbachevs promise to cleave to the leninist path 
radical soviet politician boris yeltsin as his showings in 
the last three elections have demonstrated has proved a master at 
tapping the deep undercurrent of unrest in the soviet union this 
is the last chance for the party he told a cheering crowd in 
moscow recently this is also gorbachevs last chance either he 
acts or he loses us 
tough words but yeltsin has demonstrated that he has more 
than enough popular muscle to back them up

the sun herald biloxi miss on better food labeling 
we agree wholeheartedly with louis w sullivans description of 
the american supermarket as a tower of babel as far as food 
labeling is concerned and we support his announced intention of 
reforming labeling regulations 
while americans have become more conscious of nutritional 
requirements and the importance of healthy eating habits food 
labels have become increasingly confusing and deceptive whats 
low fat to one food producer is something else to a competitor 
what high fiber means on one cereal box isnt the same as it is 
on the box next to it 
unfortunately food and drug administration officials estimate 
it will be two years before reforms are in place and consumers will 
benefit from them as secretary of health and human services 
sullivan ought to use his position to shorten that period

the waukesha county freeman waukesha wis on farmers 
it is high time to defend the poor farmer 
worse than plummeting land values worse even than losing the 
family farm the farmers image in this age of images has 
suffered an unfair beating at the uncallused hands of ersatz 
sophisticates and rude lampooners at least 
continuing to receive wide currency is the notion that farmers 
are bucolic dopes trapped in the past the notion is profoundly 
bogus 
whats really past tense here is the perverted image of a dour 
pitchforkwielding dirt farmer an animal husband whose days 
are divided between shoveling feed into one end of a cow and 
scooping up the processed feed at the other end and then completing 
the sodbound cycle by sprinkling it back on the ground in time for 
the next planting 
in fact and in truth the modern farmer is just that 
thoroughly modern some might even say slick 
just to survive along the fat red edge of financial existence 
farmers must spend incredible amounts of money on the best 
available technology 
its not just that the tractors are bigger and more complicated 
airconditioned even there are other machines as well and the 
computer has come to the farm in force 
the modern farmer shovels data and lets a machine mind the 
manure 
the roadside veggie stand has been replaced by the world market 
hybrids hormones and genetics are the stuff of the modern farm 
yes its true that some have complained about library taxes 
being unjust to the farmer because cows cant read but that 
is really another example that farmers are getting more 
sophisticated what a marvelous public relations gimmick 
illiterate cattle who but a farmer could have thought of it 
thus while we agree with the good intentions of the proponents 
of modernity we cringe when we hear our friends and allies 
besmirched with derogatory adjectives such as smalltown 
hicksville and farmertype 
and so it is time to give the farmer a break to cease casting 
farmers as unenlightened saps and to look elsewhere for our 
rhetorical buffoons 
candidates abound it neednt be a lengthy search

president fidel castro of cuba said his 
hardline communist government guarantees the independence of latin 
american nations against us domination 
if cuba falls the united states will treat latin american 
leaders not as leaders nor as presidents but with less respect 
than american mayors castro told 50000 students gathered to 
hear him late tuesday cubas official prensa latina monitored in 
mexico city carried castros remarks 
the president spoke at a celebration marking the 33rd

batista 
in 1959 castro led the popular uprising that toppled batista 
cubans will defend their revolution like children defend their 
parents castro said adding that cubas government would never

farmers have plowed up their fields 
and left crops to rot to protest an influx of cheap foreign 
products that is forcing down domestic prices 
radish growers in a southern region this week drove tractors 
over their fields and have threatened to crush nearly half their 
crops government officials promised compensation and launched an 
eatmoreradish campaign but consumers appeared to be largely 
ignoring it 
local newspapers reported wednesday that heaps of discarded 
pears have begun dotting orchards in a southern peargrowing area 
as growers opt to destroy their crops rather than put up with 
further price decreases for their products 
in recent years farmers have staged sometimes violent 
demonstrations against imported products the united states which 
pressured south korea to open its agricultural market often is 
singled out by farmers 
south koreas importation of foreign agricultural products in 
1989 was 667 billion up 168 percent from 1988 the imports 
included items such as peanuts and grapes which in the past were 
major sources of income for domestic farmers 
as a result many south korean farmers have been forced to turn 
to less lucrative crops such as radishes 
in addition negotiations are under way between us and south 
korean officials over a us request to further open the south 
korean beef market 
thousands of farmers and cattle growers battled riot police in 
1988 when the government first relaxed controls on beef imports 
officials of the agriculture ministry said about 150 million in 
subsidies have been set aside to help farmers the nations 
quarantine requirements also will be strengthened in an effort to 
curb imports they said

vietnamese army surgeons removed the 
unexploded head of an m79 rocket shell from a farmers arm in an 
extremely tense operation the official vietnam news agency said 
hoang minh son 36 was working in a field in the central 
province of thua thienhue on feb 22 when his hoe struck the 
usmade shell it detonated and sent the eggsize head into the 
farmers left arm 
in a report dated tuesday and seen in bangkok on wednesday the 
agency quoted explosives and ballistics experts as saying that it 
was too risky to tamper with the shell head as it might explode at 
the slightest displacement so immediate surgery was required 
the operation was performed feb 26 at a military hospital in 
the provincial capital of hue two surgeons volunteered for the 
job the news agency reported 
the head surgeon skillfully took the shell out of the victims 
arm and transfered it to a bomb disposal squad said the report 
it did not say where the shell came from but unexploded rounds 
left over from the vietnam war have killed or maimed many people in 
vietnam laos and cambodia since the fighting ended in 1975 
fierce bloody battles raged throughout hue the ancient 
imperial capital when the communists attacked and occupied the 
city in the pivotal tet offensive of early 1968

a subway train traveling in the wrong direction 
during rush hour nearly rammed headon into a crowded stationary 
train but quick thinking by a conductor prevented a crash the 
london underground said wednesday 
the driver of the nonmoving train reached out his window and 
pulled together two lowvoltage wires on the tunnel wall to 
shortcircuit the electricity supply said neil howard a spokesman 
for the underground 
this brought the moving train to a stop only 400 feet from the 
other train howard said it was traveling at about 20 mph 
the incident occurred at 6 pm monday on the piccadilly line 
branch of the subway system john robson the driver of the 
stationary train said wednesday he was slightly shocked when 
he saw the headlights coming toward him on the same track 
all i could think to do was to open the cab door and pull the 
emergency wires to bring him to a halt he said 
robson said when he turned around all the passengers had fled 
the first car of his train 
who can blame them they must have heard what i said over the 
radio to my control that a train had been approaching from the 
front he said there were about 800 commuters crowded onto 
robsons train 
london underground has begun an investigation said howard 
spokeswoman jocelyn baker said the nearaccident was the result 
of human error but that no decision has been made whether to take 
disciplinary action 
she said staff have been working around the clock installing 
50 red lights at crossover points in the system to prevent drivers 
from going the wrong way into tunnels 
she said the driver of the empty train should have gone south 
after letting off his passengers instead he switched to the car 
at the other end of the train and started traveling north on the 
southbound track

a 1987 amendment to the maine 
constitution that says the right to bear arms shall never be 
questioned does not mean felons have the right to own guns the 
states highest court ruled today 
plainly the people of maine who voted for the amendment never 
intended that an inmate at maine state prison or a patient in a 
mental hospital would have an absolute right to bear a firearm 
the unanimous maine supreme judicial court said 
the justices struck down a ruling from a superior court judge 
who said last year that the amendment did not prohibit a 
nonviolent habitual traffic offender edward brown from owning a 
gun 
this is a victory for common sense state attorney general 
james e tierney said in augusta the supreme court has avoided a 
hypertechnical reading of the statute 
browns lawyer daniel bates was out of town and not 
immediately available for comment a secretary said 
the amendment approved by voters said every citizen has a 
right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be 
questioned it struck out the words for the common defense 
from the original righttobeararms provision 
prior to the 1987 amendment the maine constitution afforded no 
absolute right to keep and bear arms and we now hold that no 
absolute right was created by the amendment todays ruling said 
the justices said the evident purpose of the amendment was merely 
to transform a collective right to bear arms into an individual 
right and nothing more 
the justices also said the amendment did not invalidate a state 
law prohibiting gun possession by felons 
one who has committed any felony has displayed a degree of 
lawlessness that makes it entirely reasonable for the legislature 
concerned for the safety of the public it represents to want to 
keep firearms out of the hands of such a person the justices 
said 
the case had fostered an unusual alliance among the national 
rifle association the national center to prevent handgun violence 
the sportsmans alliance of maine and the maine chiefs of police 
association all the groups supported the state attorney generals 
appeal of the lower court ruling 
the amendment was prompted by a 1986 maine supreme court ruling 
that upheld the illegal possession of firearms conviction of a 
felon who had argued that the constitution guaranteed his right to 
bear arms 
in that ruling the justices found that the constitution 
protected the right to bear arms only for the common defense

president bush toured the power plant that 
produces the white houses electricity today and acknowledged that 
it will cost utilities megabucks to comply with his proposed 
tougher clean air rules 
but bush speaking outside the potomac electric cos chalk 
point generating station said he was committed to giving industry 
flexibility in how to cut back on sulfur dioxide emissions and 
other pollution 
he urged the senate to pass the compromise version of the clean 
air act recently hammered out by senate leaders and the white house 
we cant let this country screech to a halt but i am 
determined to clean up the air declared bush 
the bill is consistent with the need to balance environmental 
benefits and sustain economic growth for this country said bush 
standing beside pepco president edward f mitchell 
bush who viewed giant twin turbines inside the plant the 
largest in maryland said ed was telling me theres megabucks 
involved in all of this he promised the new stricter rules would 
be made as costeffective as possible with utilities given 
maximum flexibility to decide how to meet them 
the chalk point plant burning coal as well as oil and natural 
gas in four units generates 2000 megawatts at the sprawling 
1160acre facility along the patuxent river 45 miles outside 
washington it now meets federal and state pollution standards 
a pepco spokeswoman nancy moses said the utility estimates it 
will cost 12 million a year to bring the plant up to the first 
phase of the proposed new clean air standards then it will take a 
capital investment of 264 million for scrubbers and other 
technology plus 36 million a year in higher operating costs to 
meet the second phase she said 
bush said pepco officials assured him their company is 
committed to take these additional steps to meet these even tougher 
standards for that were very grateful 
bush also toured the plants aquaculture center where pepco 
raises 1 million striped bass or rockfish to replenish the depleted 
waters of the nearby chesapeake bay

thousands of romanians traveled to 
austria today many hoping to apply for refugee status only hours 
before a new visa requirement takes effect 
authorities and angered citizens sought to prevent a possible 
flood of refugees and officials said they had begun turning back 
romanians who were unable to show they had sufficient hard currency 
to pay for their stay 
in the town of traiskirchen just south of vienna where 
austrias main refugee camp is located residents blocked all main 
roads to the town to prevent romanians from reaching the camp 
which officials said already was filled up with refugees many from 
the east bloc 
the visa requirement which goes into effect at midnight was 
enacted by austrian authorities following heated debates in recent 
weeks controversy over plans to house 800 romanian refugees in an 
austrian village of 200 further fueled the discussion 
according to police in the austrian border region of burgenland 
7000 romanians entered austria from hungary during the night and 
early morning 
thousands of others far more than usual headed for the 
border although travelers to budapest did not notice unusually 
heavy traffic heading toward austria 
the burgenland province police director johann schoretits said 
in a telephone interview that border authorities were instructed to 
require romanians entering austria to prove that they possess 
enough hard currency to pay for at least a 14day stay in austria 
amounting to about 400 or that they had visas for other countries 
romanians who could not show either were turned back he said 
in budapest a hungarian border guard official janos 
csehnemeth said austrian authorities had delayed the orient 
express passenger train traveling from the east to western europe 
and barred entry to about 175 romanians 25 percent of the trains 
passengers 
in budapest a border guard spokesman lt col janos zubek 
said traffic on the hungarian side of the border was normal 
but the austria press agency reported that thousands of 
romanians were waiting to enter the country before the visa 
requirement goes into effect 
the hungarianaustrian border is no longer divided by barbed 
wire and other barriers installed during the cold war hungarian 
authorities began removing them last year after democratic reforms 
and tens of thousands of east germans fled to the west over that 
border last summer 
the exodus of east germans helped cause the fall of the 
hardline communist leadership in east germany and the subsequent 
whirlwind of democratic change that swept through eastern europe 
austria has traditionally been a haven for refugees from eastern 
europe tens of thousands came from hungary in 1956 when soviet 
troops crushed an anticommunist uprising from czechoslovakia in 
1968 when a sovietled invasion squelched democratic reforms and 
most recently from east germany 
the government says most people arriving from eastern europe can 
no longer be considered political refugees under the geneva 
convention following the democratization in those countries 
the authorities say most east europeans coming to austria now 
are seeking better living conditions than they could hope for in 
the ruined economies left by the ousted communist leaderships in 
their homelands

business inventories resumed their slow growth 
in january after a onemonth decline the government reported 
wednesday and analysts said the 02 percent gain confirms the 
sluggishness in the manufacturing economy 
the commerce department said inventories totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 7959 billion including a steep 07 percent jump in 
manufacturing backlogs 
inventories as a whole fell 04 percent in december the first 
drop since a 01 percent decline in october 1988 and the largest 
since a 06 percent fall in december 1986 the december drop was 
originally reported to be 02 percent 
the january report is confirming what we already know that 
the area of manufacturing is beginning to slow said economist 
thomas runiewicz of the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
were starting to see rises in paper and chemicals and a lot 
of basic commodities that are used daily throughout the whole 
manufacturing industry he said what were seeing is that as 
the industry slows down the demand for commodities slows down 
the commerce department also reported a 03 percent increase in 
business sales to a seasonally adjusted 532 billion in january 
after falling a revised 02 percent in december december sales 
first were reported unchanged from november 
the january report resulted in a 152 ratio of inventories to 
sales the same as december but down slightly from a 153 ratio in 
both october and november the ratio means that it would take 152 
months to exhaust inventories at the january pace 
inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as 
output exceeds demand if they were to pile up excessively it 
could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs possibly 
leading to a recession 
but runiewicz said current inventory levels are not indicative 
of negative economic growth 
if anything when comparing what weve experienced in previous 
recessions weve been able to maintain or get more of a grip on 
inventories he said previous recessions were accompanied by 
some inventories becoming out of control 
retail backlogs fell 06 percent in january while sales rose 
28 percent automobile inventories dropped 36 percent as auto 
manufacturers temporarily laid off thousands of workers during the 
month to trim the number of motor vehicles stuck on backlots 
but while manufacturing inventories grew 07 percent sales 
dropped 19 percent 
wholesalers inventories advanced 02 percent while their sales 
gained 14 percent

west germany is urging the united states to 
turn over hundreds of thousands of original nazi documents but a 
leading jewish organization said wednesday it would try to persuade 
congress to stop the move 
the berlin documents center in the american sector of west 
berlin is the biggest repository of nazi documents in the world 
a delegation from west germany held talks with state department 
officials in washington on march 12 about the prospects of 
transferring the center which is run by the state department 
officials said 
we would be happier if the us government tells us we can 
have them the documents in the foreseeable future said henning 
horstmann a spokesman for the west german embassy in washington 
it is a part of german history 
west germanys parliament the bundestag passed a resolution 
last year calling for the center to be turned over as soon as 
possible 
the resolution was given impetus in recent weeks by the moves 
underway to unify east and west germany talks began wednesday in 
bonn among the two germanys and the four allied powers with 
residual control of berlin the united states the soviet union 
france and england about the unification process 
a unified germany could result in the withdrawal of the us 
presence from berlin leaving the fate of the documentation center 
uncertain 
the united states has agreed in principle to hand over the 
center to the germans but only once the original documents have 
all been copied on microfilm said a state department official who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity the copies would be brought to 
the united states 
that process begun several years ago could be completed by 
1994 the official said but the west germans want the archives 
much sooner than that said another official who also asked not to 
be named 
the world jewish congress announced it would start a drive in 
congress to prevent the state department from handing over the 
originals this would be a catastrophe if it happened said 
kalman sultanik vice president of the organization 
these documents are irreplaceable copies cant substitute for 
originals he said 
the center which houses such items as membership cards in the 
nazi party and dossiers on members of adolf hitlers elite ss 
units has been used extensively over the years to prepare 
prosecution cases against suspected nazi criminals in west germany 
and elsewhere in the world it also serves thousands of scholars of 
the nazi era 
the justice departments office of special investigations which 
makes heavy use of the center to prepare cases against suspected 
nazis opposes turning over the documents sources said 
the osi cannot rely on microfilmed documents because it often 
needs the originals to authenticate copies in court said the 
sources 
even if west germany guarantees access to the documents the osi 
is worried that that process could mean bureaucratic hassles and 
delays the sources said 
when the united states handed original documents to austria in 
1955 which included files on austrian members of the nazi party 
and dossiers on their activities the records disappeared the 
sources said 
austria said the documents were lost but us officials believe 
they were destroyed 
the disappearance came to light during the 1986 investigation of 
the nazi past of austrian president kurt waldheim in 1987 
waldheim was barred from entering the united states because of his 
alleged involvement in the persecution of jews and allied prisoners 
of war

the two germanys and the four world 
war ii allies formally agreed today to invite poland to talks on 
german unification when that countrys western border is discussed 
the decision came a day after west germany said poland which is 
concerned about possible german designs on its territory could 
join discussions on a united germanys borders 
the first formal talks on german unification between the six 
nations lasted about seven hours officials from the two germanys 
and the soviet union the united states britain and france held 
the oneday talks to lay groundwork for future discussions on 
unification which faces enormous complexities 
dieter kastrup head of the west german delegation said the 
officials had agreed poland should be included during some parts of 
the talks 
the participants agreed that poland should be invited as soon 
as questions are discussed that especially concern its border 
kastrup said 
the oneday talks are part of the twoplusfour formula of 
unification discussions agreed on last month in ottawa there has 
not been any announcement on the timing or place of the next round 
todays discussions were expected to be mainly procedural east 
germany is holding its first free elections on sunday and there is 
uncertainty about who will represent it at the next round of talks 
after their morning talks the delegates began a meeting with 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
eighteen officials from the six nations began the meeting at an 
enormous round table inside the west german foreign ministry no 
opening statement was made to reporters 
west german tv said the officials would discuss alternating the 
sites of the next meetings in the capitals of the participating 
countries the television gave no details 
the chief east german delegate deputy foreign minister ernst 
krabatsch made a few comments to journalists as he was sitting at 
the table 
he reiterated that east germany favors the participation of all 
concerned nations in unification talks at some level 
weve always favored including neighboring countries all 
interested countries including poland he said 
on tuesday west germany said poland could take part in 
discussions on a united germanys borders but it remained unclear 
whether that meant poland would actually have a voice in the 
sixpower talks or whether it would be involved in discussions in 
some other way 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany heightened international 
jitters by at first refusing to state unequivocally that a united 
germany would not claim lands ceded to poland after the third 
reichs defeat in 1945 
he has since said a united germany must sign a border treaty 
with poland but the poles are not satisfied with his stated 
position 
kohl has come under intense international scrutiny for trying to 
push unification at a pace that has worried the soviets as well as 
some of west germanys close friends and neighbors 
during the past few days kohl has launched a campaign aimed at 
soothing any bad feelings his handling of the unification process 
may have created vowing unity will not occur behind other nations 
backs 
volker ruehe general secretary of kohls christian democratic 
union told reporters tuesday that unification cannot be completed 
as long as the external questions are not settled 
ruehe said unification would likely come in steps under 
article 23 of west germanys constitution which allows for east 
german states to decide to join with their western neighbor 
he also said allgerman elections would not be likely until next 
year some time at the earliest 
ruehe said that because of enormous complexities the 
unification process may require three or more years to complete 
also tuesday officials of kohls party said it favors drastic 
cutbacks on social benefits for east germans who move to west 
germany in the future 
more than 130000 east germans have resettled in west germany 
this year alone joining 344000 who arrived last year 
christian democratic officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it is possible they may have to face shortened 
benefits for a certain period of time 
west germanys opposition social democrats have already urged 
that benefits be curtailed for the resettlers as a means of 
discouraging them from leaving their homeland but up until now 
kohl had opposed such an idea

forged by the prodemocracy movements that 
shook the soviet bloc last year east germanys historic weekend 
elections will help set the pace of reunification with west germany 
what started with thousands of prodemocracy activists taking to 
the streets of leipzig in september has led to sundays nationwide 
balloting for a 400member parliament 
voters in the nations first free elections are being presented 
with a dizzying array of 24 slates of candidates ranging from 
conservatives to radical leftists in one region the new beer 
drinkers party is running candidates 
the oncehardline communists struggling for a strong opposition 
role have changed their name lightened their image and tried to 
wipe out the memories of the regime that killed wouldbe escapees 
and crushed dissent 
but polls show the communists with 18 percent support or less 
despite the popularity of communist premier hans modrow 
now were out in the open dueling with swords said jens 
reich a cofounder of the new forum opposition movement that led 
the fall protests before it was a slaughter with clubs behind 
closed doors 
what we have accomplished is a more open democratic 
process said reich the top candidate for new forum this 
process cannot be reversed 
very few east germans have tasted true democratic government 
forty years of ironfisted communist rule replaced the nazi 
dictatorship which followed the chaos of the weimar republic 
soon after the berlin wall was opened nov 9 the leipzig 
protesters again took the lead this time with tens of thousands 
chanting germany united fatherland and waving west german flags 
almost overnight the west german conservatives dream of 
reunification loomed as a reality for chancellor helmut kohl 
both kohl and his detenteminded foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher now routinely attract huge crowds at east german election 
rallies 
god bless our german fatherland kohl says at the end of 
each of his campaign speeches drawing wild cheers 
international concerns over west germanys possible claims to 
part of poland may slow down the reunification process but another 
main signal will come from the ballots cast by the 123 million 
eligible voters 
virtually everyone in east germany agrees that historical 
forces a common language and the ties of kinship make german 
reunification inevitable 
the issue sets the changes in east germany apart from those in 
hungary czechoslovakia and other parts of eastern europe that have 
undergone prodemocracy movements 
now the main question is when made even more pressing by 
the continuing exodus of east germans to the west 
communist leader gregor gysi an affable 42yearold lawyer is 
trying to block the leftist social democrats and the conservatives 
from getting a twothirds majority coalition that would allow them 
to vote for quick reunification 
polls suggest that such a broadbased majority is a possibility 
gysi has been stumping nationwide at one point jumping from an 
airplane in a skydiving stunt as he attempts to drum up votes and 
support for slowing reunification 
the communists insist that moving too quickly would mean the end 
of the socialist systems cradletograve safety net that for 40 
years guaranteed jobs a place to live and other benefits 
at a rally tuesday night in the southeastern town of freiberg 
gysi said quick reunification would mean the loss of many of the 
rights of our citizens such as property rights womens rights 
rights of young people and others things that most people take for 
granted now 
the party repeatedly has urged against a sellout to the west 
but already contracts worth billions of dollars have been signed 
between the two german states though thats only a small fraction 
of what is expected to come 
the big fish thats never satisfied wants to swallow the 
little fish said west germanys der spiegel magazine in its 
latest issue 
at the same time even east germanys social democrats are 
starting to snipe at kohls handling of the reunification issue 
kohl heightened international concerns by at first refusing to 
state unequivocally a united germany would not claim lands given to 
poland after the third reichs defeat in 1945 he now says a united 
germany must sign a border treaty with poland but the poles are 
still not satisfied with his stated position 
in addition many europeans fear that kohl is allowing the 
unification process to distract him from plans for tighter european 
integration 
life punishes whoever goes over to kohl said ibrahim 
boehme chief of the social democrats 
it was a play on words from a russian proverb used by soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev in october when he tried to urge east 
germanys hardline leader to make political and economic changes 
life punishes whoever comes late gorbachev told erich 
honecker in his unsuccessful attempt to push reforms 
less than two weeks later the 77yearold honecker was ousted 
and now faces indictment for high treason 
the chances for survival of east germany are very small 
said guenther buch a leading west german government expert who 
keeps track of east germany 
buch added in an interview with the associated press there is 
only one reason to have this election and this is to legitimize 
the government so that a decision can be made on unification 
modrows government wasnt legitimate

irans shiite moslem militia allies 
battled with rival fighters in the slums of south beirut on 
wednesday close to where the western hostages are believed held 
police said three people were killed before syrian soldiers broke 
up the battle 
the fighting lasted five hours between the proiranian 
hezbollah or party of god and the mainstream shiite amal militia 
in the slums of shiyah ouzai and bir hasan 
the three densely populated districts are a few blocks west of 
hezbollahs hajjaj and hay madi barracks where most of the 18 
western hostages are believed held by hezbollahaffiliated 
kidnappers 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said syrian troops moved in and disengaged the 
combatants in the afternoon 
the syrian arab forces are moving in we have shoottokill 
orders any fighter spotted will be shot at shouted a syrian 
captain as he walked down ouzais main street which separates amal 
and hezbollah fighters 
syria has about 40000 soldiers in lebanon they were deployed 
in 1976 under a mandate to quell civil war fighting 
the combatants did not shoot at the syrian captain who was 
followed by about 50 heavily armed soldiers advancing slowly along 
both sides of the street police said 
the thuds of exploding rocket propelled grenades and bursts of 
machine gun fire accompanied by the wailing of ambulance sirens 
echoed across west beirut before the syrians moved in 
fighters of hezbollah and the syrianbacked amal arabic for 
hope remained on maximum alert in their respective areas of 
influence throughout west and south beirut as well as south 
lebanon and the eastern bekaa valley 
witnesses said the rival militias stocked up on ammunition and 
weapons 
the two factions have been fighting onandoff for more than two 
years for control of the 12 million shiites the largest community 
among lebanons 17 sects the latest battles erupted tuesday 
most schools in west beirut suspended classes thursday amid 
fears fighting would flare again 
hundreds of worried parents rushed to schools shortly after the 
830 am outbreak of clashes and brought their children home 
meanwhile former president jimmy carter arrived in syria on 
wednesday and said he expected to discuss the plight of foreign 
hostages in lebanon when he meets with president hafez assad this 
week 
its obvious to me that the syrian leaders are very eager to 
see the hostage question solved and so see the hostages released 
carter told reporters on arrival at damascus international airport 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon but most of the 
hostages are believed to be held by groups influenced by iran and 
often at odds with syria 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
in the eastern part of beirut rival christian forces exchanged 
sniper fire wednesday and one person was killed police said 
that raised the toll in east beirut since jan 30 to 758 killed 
and 2107 wounded the casualties have resulted from clashes 
between renegade gen michel aouns troops and samir geageas 
lebanese forces militiamen 
the factions are fighting each other for control of the 
310squaremile christian enclave

the us economy continues to grow slowly 
although there is widespread weakness in the automobile industry 
the federal reserve said wednesday in its latest survey of economic 
activity across the country 
most federal reserve districts describe economic activity as 
expanding slowly the central bank survey found consumer 
spending varies from moderate to strong except for auto sales 
which have slowed after a january rebound 
the manufacturing sector is soft but is improving in some 
districts the report said noting that the boston philadelphia 
and st louis district banks reported declines 
the weakness in autos and autorelated industries however is 
widespread according to a summary of the study however it 
found auto dealer inventories improved after sales incentives were 
restored in january 
the survey was prepared by the federal reserve bank of chicago 
based on information gathered before march 6 
the survey found sluggish construction activity in most 
districts except chicago and san francisco which reported 
relatively strong activity 
it said agricultural conditions were generally good although 
concern over lack of soil moisture was expressed in the midwest and 
west actual drought damage was reported in the dallas district 
freeze damage to fruits and vegetables caused some problems in 
the atlanta and dallas districts it said with atlanta reporting 
that citrus prices are likely to remain high throughout 1990 
the dallas district also reported that it may be two years 
before marketable citrus can again be produced in the rio grande 
valley of texas 
other natural resourcerelated industries such as forestry 
products mining and oil and gas drilling were reported to be 
generally very strong 
banks have become less aggressive in making new loans and 
demand for most types of loans has softened the summary said 
most districts report that financial institutions are either less 
willing to extend credit or actually tightening credit terms 
but the report did not mention any inflationary problems that 
prompted the federal open market committee to tighten credit a year 
ago the move drove up interest rates and slowed the economy 
interest rates have edged down gradually since last summer 
the fed survey is conducted eight times a year in preparation 
for meetings of the fomc the feds monetary policysetting arm 
the next meeting is march 27

mongolias ruling communist party 
agreed thursday to give up its monopoly on power and selected its 
youngest leadership in years including a reformer to head the 
party 
the party which has ruled mongolia for 66 years met 
virtually all the demands made by newly formed opposition parties 
in recent weeks the opposition groups protests since january led 
to the special central committee meeting which opened monday and 
ended early thursday 
the central committee of the mongolian peoples revolutionary 
party named 61yearold gombojavyn ochirbat its new general 
secretary and chose an entirely new fiveman politburo 
this is the beginning of real change said foreign minstry 
spokesman tepbishiin chimeddorj 
former party leader jambyn batmonh remains mongolian president 
even though he lost his party job 
in another dramatic repudiation of its past the policymaking 
central committee voted to expel former party leader yumjaagiyn 
tsedenbal from the party tsedenbal 73 presided over purges of 
the party during his 31 years in power that ended in 1984 he now 
lives in moscow 
ochirbat spent the last two years as party representative to the 
world marxist review based in prague czechoslovakia 
he had been a member of the central committee but had not played 
an active role in mongolian politics for the past two years he 
returned to mongolia in the past few days when he was invited to 
attend the committee meeting 
ochirbat had been head of the mongolian trade unions in the 
early 1980s but was ousted in 1982 and indirectly criticized by 
the central committee under tsedenbal it offered no specific 
public criticism 
a government official speaking on condition of anonymity 
characterized ochirbat as a reformer and indicated he was not 
closely linked to batmonh 
the central committee proposed an extraordinary party conference 
on april 10 that will select a new central committee 
most elderly members of the current central committee offered 
their resignations more than half of the committees 174 full and 
nonvoting members are 60 years old or more 
besides ochirbat the other four members of the new politburo 
all are reformminded and less than 50 years old giving the party 
its youngest leadership in years 
the new leaders include l tudev director of the party 
newspaper unen and chairman of the mongolian union of journalists 
foreign minister ts gombosuren m michigdorg and ts oold 
chairman of the partys control commission 
it was not immediately clear whether the new politburo would 
serve after the party congress the new central committee elected 
by the congress has the right to choose a new politburo 
party leaders also have agreed to hold early elections this year 
for a new legislature oppostion groups want elections this summer

martin marietta corp today launched 
a powerful commercial rocket to boost a 140 million communications 
satellite into orbit but the uninsured satellite did not 
immediately signal that it was working 
the big titan 3 blasted off at 652 am est into a cloudy sky 
from the cape canaveral air force station 
intelsat the international communications company hoped for 
confirmation the satellite was working on its third expected pass 
over a tracking station on hawaii at about 11 am but no signal 
was confirmed said don oneal a spokesman for hughes aircraft 
co which built the satellite 
at midday the washington dcbased intelsat issued a brief 
statement saying that the satellite is encountering 
difficulties adding that company officials hoped to have more 
information later 
the north american aerospace command in colorado which tracks 
objects in space said it was asked by martin marietta to locate 
the satellite 
the satellite separated from the rocket 25 minutes after launch 
said judy stowell a martin marietta spokeswoman but satellite 
industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
separation had not occurred 
we think we did a very good and a very accurate job said 
edward m browne president of martin marietta commercial titan inc 
but no data was received from the satellite when it passed over 
hawaii at midmorning hughes said it also was not clear if an 
onboard rocket motor fired to send the satellite into a higher 
orbit that should have occurred before the satellite sent its 
first signals back to earth 
i dont know where the problem is at this point but i can say 
weve not gotten a firm signal yet said oneal it has 
happened in the past but it is unusual 
he was not certain whether the problem was on the ground or on 
the satellite 
the commercial launch of the intelsat vi satellite owned by a 
notforprofit international consortium is the fourth by an 
american company 
the 5ton satellite nearly four stories tall with its antennas 
and solar panels deployed was intended to transmit up to 120000 
telephone calls and three television channels for more than 13 
years 
the satellite was to replace two older satellites over the 
atlantic ocean 
it was scheduled to reach final orbit 22300 miles above earth 
on sunday and then was to undergo tests before being placed in 
service in late may 
the first intelsat vi launched in october by the european space 
agencys ariane rocket is being tested in orbit and will be placed 
in service april 7 
frederick ormsby spacecraft mission director for the 
international telecommunications satellite organization or 
intelsat said last months explosion of an ariane rocket should 
not affect plans to launch two more intelsat vi satellites on 
ariane boosters next year 
the unmanned ariane rocket carrying two japanese communications 
satellites blew apart over the atlantic shortly after taking off 
from kourou french guiana the accident prompted arianespace 
which runs the program to suspend all ariane launches pending an 
investigation 
intelsat did not insure the satellite launched today ormsby 
said because the ariane explosion put already high insurance 
prices out of range 
the launch and satellite together cost an estimated 270 million 
intelsat a washington dcbased commercial cooperative of 118 
member nations owns and operates a global communications satellite 
system used by more than 170 countries todays launch is its 44th 
the first intelsat communications satellite was launched 25 years 
ago next month 
the titan 3 built at martin mariettas denver plant is the 
most powerful us commercial rocket martin mariettas first 
commercial launch of the titan 3 on dec 31 propelled british and 
japanese communications satellites into orbit 
mcdonnell douglas launched the first us commercial rocket the 
delta which took a british satellite broadcasting satellite into 
orbit last august general dynamics plans to enter the competition 
in june with its atlas rocket

a police officer was convicted and 
sentenced to 4 years in prison wednesday for his part in the 
bloody crackdown on dissent that began the uprising against 
communist rule news reports said 
first lt jaroslav oudran was the first of 25 police officers to 
be tried for assaulting demonstrators in prague 
on nov 17 1989 riot police in the city brutally dispersed 
tens of thousands of people marking the 50th anniversary of the 
death of jan opletal a student who died while protesting the nazi 
occupation of czechoslovakia in 1939 
the crackdown triggered protests that eventually swept the 
hardline leadership of milos jakes from power and ended four 
decades of communist rule playwright and onetime dissident vaclav 
havel was later elected president 
oudran was accused of beating an onlooker katerina vavrova 29 
causing brain a contusion and neck injury and making her unfit to 
work for three months 
oudran pleaded guilty of abuse of power of an official ctk 
said the crime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison oudran 
was convicted and sentenced by the court in terezin 40 miles north 
of prague the news agency said 
both the prosecution and defense said they had not decided 
whether to appeal the verdict 
i have pronounced a sentence approximately identical to the 
one demanded by the prosecution and i am of the opinion it is a 
just verdict judge miroslav janzura told ctk 
during the trial oudran repeatedly expressed regret over his 
actions claiming he was in severe emotional distress 
according to the prosecution oudran took ms vavrova by the 
hair and beat her head against a pillar four times before she fell 
to the ground then he allegedly kicked her in the hip

a proposal to streamline death penalty appeals 
should be changed to provide greater legal protection for people 
accused or convicted of murder the federal judiciarys 
policymaking arm recommended wednesday 
the 27member judicial conference of the united states proposed 
modifying a plan by a committee appointed by chief justice william 
h rehnquist and headed by retired supreme court justice lewis f 
powell 
the conference proposals which will be submitted to congress 
are aimed at assuring competent legal help for all defendants who 
face the death penalty from the initial trial through successive 
rounds of appeals 
the conference adopted the report at a private meeting tuesday 
the results were announced wednesday 
david sellers a spokesman for the conference said the judges 
were divided over the issue he declined to reveal the vote 
the announcement was hailed by civil libertarians who have 
attacked the the rehnquist committees plan 
leslie harris of the american civil liberties union said the 
proposed changes were a stunning departure that could go a long 
way toward protecting the rights of defendants in capital 
punishment cases 
the judicial conference urged that any state choosing to adopt 
the streamlined procedures must adhere to a proposed national 
standard for determining which lawyers are qualified to represent 
defendants in capital cases 
the judges endorsed a proposal by the american bar association 
which recommended softening the impact of the rehnquist committees 
plan 
the judges whose views are expected to carry considerable 
weight in congress also proposed changing the plan to make it 
easier for death row inmates to file repeated appeals challenging 
their death sentences 
the rehnquist committee proposed that states limit death row 
inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal courts one 
round would challenge a verdict directly a second would be based 
on alleged violations of the condemned individuals rights 
if the plan is approved by congress states that decide to go 
along would be required to assure legal help to death row inmates 
at taxpayer expense throughout the appeals process that is not the 
case now 
the aclu and other groups that attacked the original plan said 
its promise of more legal help for death row inmates is an empty 
one because it offers no assurance that stateappointed lawyers 
will be competent 
there are more than 2200 convicted murderers on death rows 
nationwide only 121 executions have occurred since the supreme 
court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 
the average delay between conviction and execution is more than 
eight years 
the judicial conference also announced it is giving news 
organizations more time to present their views on letting 
television cameras into federal courtrooms the conference will 
postpone until september its report on televising federal court 
proceedings 
basically the door is still open on this issue sellers 
said 
the conference has opposed such televised coverage

president bush is targeting planned 
construction at several military bases slated for closing or 
realignment to help finance a 300 million aid package for 
nicaragua 
the letter detailing the proposed sources for the assistance 
caused consternation wednesday among lawmakers who complained in 
january when defense secretary dick cheney announced his candidates 
for closure that the list was partisan 
cheney recommended closing or scaling back more than 72 domestic 
facilities and 14 overseas installations but faces an uphill fight 
trying to persuade congress to accept that list 
complicating the situation is the administrations decision to 
include several of those facilities on its list of possible sources 
for nicaraguan aid 
the list was sent to members of congress this week the 
associated press obtained a copy wednesday 
a total of 31 million would come from canceling or delaying 
work on an automated record fire range at fort ord calif the 
porter river road bridge and physical fitness training center at 
fort knox ky and barracks modernization battalion headquarters 
and a vehicle wash facility at fort hood texas 
savings from canceling plans to build a hazardous and flammable 
storehouse at the philadelphia naval shipyard would total 10 
million 
rep thomas foglietta dpa complained to pentagon officials 
that the congress included money for the warehouse in last years 
budget and questioned whether officials cared about safety 
david berteau a deputy assistant secretary of defense for 
production and logistics told the house armed services 
subcommittee on military installations and facilities that the 
shipyard is part of the proposed list for closure 
this is based in part on a force structure reduction 
berteau said pentagon officials believe studying candidates is 
the right way to go 
the presidents list to help finance aid to the central american 
nation also includes 11 million that had been slated for repair of 
the no 2 gun turret aboard the uss iowa 
the turret was destroyed in the april 19 explosion that killed 
47 sailors

tom cruise who got stopped for speeding 
while in town to film a movie on car racing was allowed to plead 
guilty to a lesser charge and pay a decreased fine 
city officials even discussed dropping the charge against the 
27yearold actor but decided not to in fear of adverse publicity 
mayor ronnie ward said 
cruise was charged with driving 66 mph in a 35 mph zone on march 
2 he could have paid as much as 237 in fines and fees and had six 
points lodged against his south carolina driving record 
instead he paid a 125 fine monday after city judge dan causey 
reduced the charge to careless operation of a vehicle which 
carries no point penalty 
cruise was able to pay the fine before his case came up in 
court and not miss any time filming days of thunder at 
darlington international raceway 
ward called the plea bargain sort of a happy medium he said 
cruise was not driving drunk or recklessly but you dont want 
him to get off scotfree

twothirds of the members of the senate have 
sent a letter to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev criticizing his 
government for continuing to deny exit visas to some longtime 
refuseniks sponsors said wednesday 
in the spirit of the continuing renewal of cooperation between 
our two countries we are writing to express our concern about the 
problem of soviet citizens who have been refused permission to 
emigrate the letter said 
the letter dated march 2 and circulated by sens bob graham 
dfla and dennis deconcini dariz was signed by 67 senators 
the senators said in the letter that they found it extremely 
disturbing that many families remain trapped in the soviet union 
they praised gorbachev for moving quickly to grant visas to some 
refuseniks generally soviet jews who were barred from practicing 
their faith in the soviet union other they said have seen their 
cases languish 
more than 20 people on a list submitted to gorbachev first 
applied to leave the soviet union more than a decade ago 
for these people and for all those arbitrarily denied the 
right to leave their country we request your careful attention 
the letter said 
those who are kept in soviet union are often denied visas on the 
grounds they had access to state secrets at some time the state 
secrets law is simply an excuse the letter said 
the senators cited the case of vladimir raiz who first applied 
to emigrate 25 years ago 
stacy burdette a spokeswoman for the union of councils for 
soviet jews a group that presses for looser soviet emigration 
policies said raiz and his wife carmen were granted exit visas 
within the last few days 
while thousands of jews have moved to israel and the united 
states in recent years burdette said there are an estimated 
850000 still trying to leave the country where antisemitism has 
flared 
about 71000 people emigrated last year 
moreover she said president bush gave gorbachev a list of 20 
people the united states would like to see given permission to 
leave when the two met at the malta summit in november of those 
17 cases have not been addressed 
burdette said there is legislation pending in the supreme soviet 
that would reform the emigration process and limit to five years 
the time a person could be blocked by the state secrets act

foreign secretary douglas hurds request to visit 
iraq to ask for mercy on behalf of a journalist condemned to death 
has been rejected the government said wednesday 
a foreign office spokesman said hurd asked britains ambassador 
to iraq to arrange a meeting for him with president saddam hussein 
of iraq 
the foreign office announced that the iraqi government responded 
this would not be the right time for a visit 
it was made clear that the iraqi government did not feel able 
to discuss these cases in the present atmosphere said the 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
iraqi embassy spokesman wajdi mardan said wednesday that iraq 
considered a visit by hurd rather inconvenient in view of the 
probability that this visit could be seen as part of the current 
media campaign which is presumably intended to bring pressure on 
the iraqi government 
britain has been waging a diplomatic and media campaign seeking 
clemency for the londonbased journalist farzad bazoft who was 
convicted of espionage by an iraqi court last week and sentenced to 
death 
britain is also trying to win clemency for a british nurse 
sentenced to 15 years in prison for allegedly helping bazoft 
the nurse daphne parish 52 was charged with driving bazoft to 
iraqs aliskandaria military complex in september where he was 
investigating reports of an explosion at the complex 
iraq has not set a date for the execution 
the iraqi news agency reported tuesday that hussein said he will 
not decide whether to commute the death sentence while under 
political and media pressure 
british officials said the government will continue to campaign 
for clemency but they acknowledged privately they faced a problem 
in striking a balance between keeping up the pressure and creating 
what one called a counterproductive reaction in iraq 
a delegation of human rights groups and media unions met with 
the iraqi ambassador in london on wednesday to express their 
concern over bazofts death sentence 
requests for a reduction of the sentences have already been sent 
by un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar amnesty 
international the european community and international press 
groups 
bazoft a stateless iranian has lived in britain since 1975 and 
travels on british documents he is a reporter for the observer a 
british weekly mrs parish is a senior nursing administrator for 
an irishrun hospital in baghdad

lawmakers who last year refused to touch 
legislation that would have led to an outside study of the 
veterans health care system were ready wednesday to tell the 
department of veterans affairs how to run a similar internal study 
congress must also play a role in the future of the va health 
care system rep gv montgomery dmiss said at a hearing of 
the veterans affairs subcommittee on hospitals and health care 
after all the legislative branch is the policy making body 
said montgomery chairman of the full committee and the 
subcommittee 
montgomery last summer rejected a proposal by veterans secretary 
edward j derwinski for legislation that would have created an 
outside review commission to study the departments health care 
network 
montgomery said at the time that congress was not in the 
mood for such a commission which was proposed as lawmakers were 
considering recommendations from a commission to close military 
bases 
derwinski acknowledging the poor political timing of the 
legislative proposal last january said he would appoint his own 
commission derwinski pledged wednesday that the commission he was 
proposcing would be independent and he had no intention of 
recommending that facilities be closed 
still va facilities could undergo important changes in a 
statusconscious health care industry for example only one 
facility in a group could offer openheart surgery or some 
hospitals could be converted to clinics or longterm care

gov gaston caperton all but ruled out 
an acrosstheboard raise in an offer to west virginias striking 
teachers that was quickly rejected by the states largest education 
union 
caperton made the proposal described by the governors 
education secretary as his last best and final offer late 
tuesday after a second day of talks aimed at ending the states 
first teacher strike now in its sixth school day 
among other things the governor proposed an education 
summit in may adjustments in pay aimed at equalizing teacher 
salaries statewide and full funding of health insurance and 
pensions 
but in a reversal from last week he said he would call a 
special legislative session to consider a raise only if the state 
develops a big enough surplus this years budget is running 295 
million behind estimates 
the west virginia education association said today that 
capertons proposal to call a special legislative session only if 
the surplus is high enough was too vague 
as for the proposed may summit meeting on education wvea 
president kayetta meadows said in a statement that it was 
positive but lacking in substance 
teachers have been on the picket lines for concrete 
improvements for years theyve heard promises and those promises 
have been consistently broken she said the education summit 
will simply be another study if it is not backed by a special 
legislative session 
gubernatorial spokesman gc morse called the unions decision 
sad 
the governor is very disappointed morse said he feels 
like a tragedy is being worked out here by some folks that really 
dont understand west virginias fiscal situation and the strains 
were operating under 
in announcing his propossal caperton said the state simply 
cannot afford to do more no matter how justified their position 
may be on the matter of teacher compensation i bear a 
responsibility to the taxpayers of west virginia 
meadows group the 16000member wvea is the larger of the two 
groups that went on strike last week the smaller union group the 
3000member west virginia federation of teachers promised a 
response to capertons proposal later this afternoon 
more than 85 percent of west virginias 22000 teachers walked 
out march 7 for higher pay and benefits by tuesday the strike had 
spread to 46 of the states 55 counties 
steve haid secretary of education called the governors 
proposal his last best and final effort which he could 
legitimately undertake 
if the teachers do not accept the proposal decisions on whether 
striking teachers lose pay for days they were off work are 
suspended or dismissed rest with the county school boards and 
school superintendents haid said at a briefing this morning 
the legislature will likely adjourn tonight or thursday 
theyre going home haid said the governors authority in the 
matter is very very narrow 
the number of teachers and students affected was not immediately 
available but on monday the strike idled nearly 150000 of the 
states 328000 school students about 3000 of the states 
teachers are not unionized 
in wood county where teachers have voted to remain on the job 
about half of the 800 students at parkersburg south high school 
left class today when roving pickets set up a strike line in front 
of the school principal tim swarr said 
on march 5 the governor and legislative leaders offered the 
teachers a 5 percent raise financed by a tax increase for coal 
producers but that deal collapsed the next day 
on tuesday he said he wouldnt offer an acrosstheboard raise 
because it would require a tax increase 
the states average teacher salary is 21904 less than every 
state except arkansas and south dakota according to the national 
education association that figure does not include a 5 percent 
raise teachers received in february 
caperton called the meetings with the teacher representatives 
cordial and fruitful 
and although we have not yet reached a final agreement on 
returning teachers to the classrooms we have closed the distance 
between ourselves and that goal he said

three weeks ago a mongolian opposition leader 
predicted that the pace of political change in ulan bator would be 
faster than in moscow 
the events of the past week have proved sanjaasuren zorig right 
the leadership has bowed to opposition demands for sweeping 
political changes and those who just a few weeks ago talked about 
the ideal government and economy for mongolia must now find ways to 
realize those dreams 
on monday the communist party politburo decided to abolish its 
constitutional guarantee on power replace the politburo and party 
general secretary jambyn batmonh hold early legislative elections 
and write a new constitution 
the central committee on thursday approved ending the 
66yearold guarantee on power chose a reformer to lead the party 
and installed its youngest politburo in years 
these changes come less than three months after mongolias first 
opposition group the mongolian democratic union headed by zorig 
came on the scene staging peaceful rallies urging political reform 
since then a halfdozen other political groups have emerged 
and three political parties have formed the latest tuesday 
the groups have joined together to urge faster sweeping 
political reform even though they disagree on what type of 
government and economy would be best for mongolia a nation of 19 
million 
in late february zorig sat beneath a portrait of karl marx in a 
classroom at the mongolian state university in the capital ulan 
bator he told a small group of reporters what he envisions for 
mongolias future 
the most important thing to be carried out is political 
changes the main methods to carry out this political construction 
is first to create a multiparty system introduce a parliamentary 
system and have presidential rule he said 
also to give political freedom to the people 
zorig a 27yearold postgraduate student of scientific 
communism and a former university lecturer envisaged a collective 
not stateowned economy 
zorig said he wanted to turn this creditfed economy into an 
independent economy mongolia has been economically dependent on 
the soviet union for decades and western economists put the debt 
at close to 6 billion 
land would be leased for cultivation and there would be no 
limits on the number of privately owned cattle in this nomadic 
society where 70 percent of the population still are herdsmen 
enterprises would be decentralized and leased to workers and those 
operating at a loss would be shut down 
the main goal is that those who are working should taste the 
real fruits of their work zorig said 
if the current leadership steps down zorig said a coalition 
government probably would be formed 
surely we will be members of that he said even in this 
year the mongolian democratic party will be member of parliament 
such hopes for change were not limited to those in the 
opposition 
even a herdswoman who lives outside ulan bator and had only 
heard of what was happening in the capital asked why shouldnt 
these parties all coexist 
a ranking government official who has visited western countries 
and observed the workings of those government said he dreams of a 
new look for mongolia 
after a fiveyear period of transition and learning he 
predicted mongolia would have a parliamentary democracy with a 
presidential system like the united states that is the most 
effective and least costly way 
the economy would be dynamic exportoriented and ruled by 
market forces and mongolians would have heightened nationalism 
and selfesteem said the official who spoke on condition he not 
be identified

the soviet union offered afghanistan 
emergency military support during last weeks coup attempt but the 
communist government turned down the aid president najib said in a 
speech obtained wednesday 
najib also disclosed that two days before the failed takeover 
he suspected the defense minister shah nawaz tanai was plotting a 
coup and offered him the post of presidency it is yours if you 
think you can rule najib said 
tanai launched his raid tuesday he fled to pakistan when the 
takeover failed but is now believed to be back in afghanistan 
teamed with a radical guerrilla leader 
najib made his remarks in a speech sunday to tribal elders from 
paktiya province an afghan official provided an english 
translation wednesday of the speech which was given in pushtu 
both najib and tanai are from paktiya the speech was seen as an 
attempt by the president to nullify tanais influence among the 
tribes of the southeastern province 
earlier wednesday foreign minister abdul wakil said afghanistan 
will destroy its huge stockpiles of sovietsupplied weapons if the 
united states and other countries stop supporting moslem rebels 
the offer could help pave the way for peace talks on afghanistan 
after 12 years of civil war 
during the soviet military intervention in afghanistan the 
country amassed huge stockpiles of weapons including thousands of 
trucks tanks armored personnel carriers bombs missiles and guns 
in negotiations last year the united states rejected a soviet 
proposal for an end to military aid to the warring sides because 
this would have allowed the kabul government to keep those 
stockpiles 
najib did not specify the type of aid offered by the soviets 
during the coup attempt 
i told them thank you for your offer but theres no need 
now najib said 
but he said if we face a foreign attack that will be 
different 
soviet troops were withdrawn in 1989 from afghanistan after 
about a decade supporting najibs troops moscow still gives kabul 
about 300 million monthly in military aid and this has increased 
since the bloody coup try 
in a dispatch wednesday the soviet news agency tass said 200 
civilians died and 500 were injured in the attempt 
najibs government has reported only 95 civilian deaths no 
military casualties have been given 
in his speech najib said he feared tanai a hardline 
communist would unite with guerrilla leader gulbuddin hekmatyar a 
radical fundamentalist to take the strategic city of khost 
the afghan government has reported increased fighting around 
khost in the past two days 
throughout the speech najib referred to the defense minister 
only by his first name an insult to afghans 
the president said two days before the coup attempt he invited 
tanai to his office i had heard rumors that he wanted something 
so i said take the presidency it is yours if you think you can 
rule najib said 
tanai refused the post and pledged loyalty to najib the 
president said 
two days later he was bombing me najib said 
meanwhile in the capital three rockets fell wednesday killing 
one civilian and wounding 11 government spokesman naqib sameer 
said 
it was the first fatal rocket attack in more than one week 
pakistans prime minister benazir bhutto called for an end to 
us and soviet arms shipments to afghanistan 
it is time for all concerned to stop having favorites and 
leave it up to the afghans mrs bhutto said in islamabad let 
them decide what they want

president bush touring a power plant that 
helps keep the lights on at the white house was told by an 
official wednesday that utilities will have to come up with 
megabucks to comply with proposed new pollution rules 
but bush pledged that clean air act revisions working their way 
through congress will allow smokestack industries maximum 
flexibility on how to meet the stricter new standards 
we cant let this country screech to a halt but i am 
determined to clean up the air declared the president exhorting 
senators to pass a compromise hammered out recently by white house 
and senate leaders 
the compromise recognizes the need to balance environmental 
benefits and sustain economic growth for this country said bush 
bush traveled 45 miles by helicopter to visit the potomac 
electric power cos chalk point generating station which churns 
out 2000 megawatts of electricity for washington and the maryland 
suburbs 
the chalk point plant now in compliance with federal and state 
standards is among 107 across the nation that would be forced to 
reduce emissions sharply under the new rules 
bush said utility president edward f mitchell his tour guide 
was telling me theres megabucks involved in all of this 
nancy s moses the utilitys manager of media relations said 
its officials estimate a cost of 12 million a year to meet the 
first phase of the clean air rules in 1995 primarily by burning 
more oil and less coal 
to meet the second phase standards for the year 2000 the 
utility envisions bills of 264 million in capital costs for 
scrubbers and other new technology and 36 million in recurrent 
operating costs 
bush promised that industry would get the flexibility to make 
emissions reductions in the most costeffective manner possible 
the president donned a white hard hat to inspect two giant 
turbinegenerators each capable of turning out 340 megawatts with 
an assist from plant manager hula edmonds bush turned a dial that 
boosted output by 10 megawatts 
bush said utility executives assured him they were committed 
to take these additional steps to meet these even tougher 
standards for that were very grateful 
bush also toured the plants aquaculture center where the 
utility raises striped bass or rockfish to replenish the depleted 
waters of the nearby chesapeake bay it has already released 1 
million fingerlings 
bush plucked two adult rockfish out of a net he also peered 
through a microscope at yellow perch eggs and afterward applauded 
the utilitys efforts on the environment 
on tuesday in another pitch for the clean air act bush made a 
shorter hop by car to daves sunoco station a mile from the us 
capitol to pump methanol fuel into an experimental car

most house democrats want to cut president 
bushs proposed 303 billion defense budget for 1991 but are 
willing to wait to make really deep slashes party leaders said 
wednesday 
after a closeddoor discussion about defense spending attended 
by many of the houses 257 majority democrats ranking lawmakers 
conceded that they had not decided how much military spending the 
party should seek 
however they said a consensus was clear 
i think everybody understands this is not the same game on 
defense said budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
this is a changed ballgame because its a changing world 
situation 
whatever happens in the soviet union you arent going to get 
that humpty dumpty back together again to become the military 
threat it once was said armed services committee chairman les 
aspin dwis 
the leaders said however that their goal was to reduce defense 
spending gradually 
democrats want a longterm defense policy said majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo 
lawmakers who attended the session attributed that tack to two 
factors a desire to arrive at a figure that would attract enough 
votes to pass congress and the way military spending works 
the leadership is still trying to figure out what number is 
going to get to 218 votes the total required for house passage 
said rep jim slattery dkan a member of the budget committee 
the mechanics of the budget are also playing a role 
because much military spending occurs gradually over several 
years such as the construction of a submarine it can take years 
for a cut made in one year to be fully reflected in the budget 
what you have to reverse is what took place over the last 
eight or nine years said panetta referring to the arms buildup 
under the reagan administration 
that means youre looking at another four or fiveyear path 
in the opposite direction he said 
since bush submitted his fiscal 1991 budget proposal to congress 
in january most democrats have argued that the president did not 
go far enough in shrinking the pentagons budget in response to the 
thaw in the cold war 
bushs proposal was 7 billion more than this years figure but 
3 billion below what would have been needed to match inflation 
conservatives have argued that uncertainty about the future 
political situation in the soviet union and eastern europe make it 
unwise to cut too deeply into bushs plan liberals have sought 
deeper cuts to as low as the high 280 billion range arguing 
that the money would be better spent for deficitreduction and 
social programs 
congress budget committees are nearing the time when they will 
have to write a spending blueprint for the next fiscal year which 
begins oct 1 wednesdays democratic skullsession which lasted 
about two hours was an effort to begin translating partymembers 
criticisms into a solid dollar figure that would win enough votes 
for passage

two of joseph hazelwoods expert 
witnesses took aim at the prosecutions alcohol expert testifying 
that belated bloodalcohol tests cannot prove the exxon valdez 
skipper was drunk when his ship went aground 
alcohol experts michael hlstala and thomas burr cast doubt 
tuesday on testimony by prosecution expert richard prouty that 
hazelwood probably was drunk when his ship rammed a charted reef a 
year ago 
its virtually impossible to go back and get meaningful 
information about bloodalcohol levels said hlstala a professor 
of physiology at washington state university in seattle once you 
are beyond a few hours its impossible to make any sense of an 
extrapolation 
in this mornings testimony an expert said an audio tape the 
prosecution wants jurors to hear is actually a poor copy of a coast 
guard tape 
edward siedlick a former police detective and now a consultant 
in new york said he analyzed the tape and found that its quality 
was so poor that it probably speeded up hazelwoods voice 
the expert was called after prosecutors indicated they wanted 
jurors to hear hazelwoods voice on a tape made on the exxon 
valdezs trip into valdez before the tanker went aground march 24 
on the outbound trip they suggested it would show the skippers 
voice was much different from when he reported the grounding to the 
coast guard and would help prove he was drunk on the later tape 
siedlick said he went to valdez last month to listen to the 
original of the tapes but when he got there coast guard officers 
told him the original had been destroyed he said he subsequently 
learned that the copy in evidence was made by a coast guardsman 
holding a microcassette recorder up to another recorder 
this tape led me to the conclusion that this microcassette 
copy was not an accurate reproduction of the conversation 
siedlick said the pitch of the tape seemed to exceed that of the 
normal talking voice of capt hazelwood 
also this morning hlstala testified that listening to someones 
voice was not a very good way to judge whether the person was drunk 
in his prosecution testimony prouty indicated he calculated 
hazelwoods level of intoxication by calculations in a method 
called retrograde extrapolation he concluded the skipper 
probably had a bloodalcohol reading of 14 at the time of the 
shipwreck 
but he based his opinion on a blood test taken 10 hours 
afterward which showed hazelwood had a blood alcohol level of 
061 lower than the alaska state limit for drunken driving 
was the skipper drinking after the wreck nobody knows and 
hazelwood isnt expected to testify about it 
the lack of a timely blood test has been a prosecution problem 
from the beginning of the case providing no direct evidence that 
the skipper was tipsy 
circumstantial evidence includes testimony from crew members who 
saw hazelwood drinking in valdez that day but they said he 
negotiated a precarious gangway to the ship without a misstep and 
appeared sober as he gave orders 
three witnesses two of them coast guard investigators have 
said they smelled alcohol on hazelwoods breath but defense 
lawyers suggest that was the result of the skippers having drunk a 
lowalcohol brew called moussy beer while on the ship 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny was the only crew member 
from the exxon valdez charged criminally in the wreck which 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of alaska north slope crude oil 
into the crystal waters of prince william sound 
he is accused of criminal mischief reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil if convicted he faces a maximum penalty of 7 years in prison 
and 61000 in fines 
hlstala testified tuesday that most experts consider the 
technique of retrograde extrapolation used by prouty the 
prosecution expert useful only for calculating back two to three 
hours not 10 hours 
in hazelwoods case he said there would be numerous variables 
such as the rate at which his body absorbs and eliminates alcohol 
the exact times the captain started and stopped drinking and 
whether he ate anything in the 14 hours after boarding the ship 
testimony in the trial has not established conclusive levels for 
any of the variables 
the prosecution says hazelwood spent seven hours drinking in a 
valdez bar before he set sail the defense says he was in the bar 
no more than three hours prosecutors say he had five drinks the 
defense says he had two or three 
burr an alcohol consultant and former police crime lab 
specialist from minneapolis disputed proutys findings saying 
that if hazelwood drank anything after the accident theres 
absolutely no validity in proutys results 
but he conceded on crossexamination by assistant district 
attorney brent cole that experienced drinkers often are able to 
mask the effects of alcohol 
cole challenged the qualifications of both experts suggesting 
their credentials were inferior to proutys experience as a 
toxicologist in oklahoma

the bush administration appears to be making a 
stronger link between us aid to israel and its opposition to 
jewish settlements in the occupied territories some members of 
congress say 
the issue surfaced recently when secretary of states james a 
baker iii was questioned about the administrations position on a 
congressional proposal to help israel raise 400 million to settle 
soviet immigrants 
under the proposal israel could borrow 400 million from 
commercial lenders at belowmarket interest rates the united 
states would guarantee repayment of the 30year loans 
baker told the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations that the administration might be able to support the 
legislation if the government provides some assurance it would 
not be engaging in any new or additional settlement activity in the 
territories 
the occupied territories are in the west bank and gaza lands 
seized by israel after the sixday war in 1967 arab leaders have 
voiced concern that the thousands of soviet jewish immigrants 
flocking to israel might move to the territories 
rep david obey dwis the subcommittees chairman said 
israeli officials have said they dont feel they can give those 
flatout assurances 
but obey said the israelis have promised that very very few 
refugees less than 10 percent would move to the territories 
president bush says he will endorse the housing investment 
guarantee proposal only if the united states and israel can work 
out assurances that satisfy washington on jewish settlements in 
the west bank and gaza 
rep howard berman dcalif said he saw a subtle change here 
in administration policy on the jewish settlements 
he spelled out what he saw as the change the united states has 
long opposed jewish settlements in the territories and has insisted 
that israel not spend us money on construction there israel has 
always made such guarantees and is prepared to do so again 
but now he said the administration seems to be saying it wants 
to ensure that israel doesnt spent any money money from other 
sources as well as us aid on new settlements 
we have never attempted to tie any of our assistance to how 
the israelis spent their money on jewish settlements in the 
occupied territories berman said 
thomas a dine executive director of the american israel public 
affairs committee a lobby for us aid to israel said 
administration officials are telling israel we want an assurance 
that you wont put any of your own resources into the 
territories 
this is telling a democratic society that it must limit the 
freedom of movement of its people in order to get us 
assistance dine said this is holding housingforsovietjews 
hostage so we can reopen an old debate about settlements 
however faris bouhafa a spokesman for the american arab 
antidiscrimination committee praised the administration for 
standing firm on the settlement issue building jewish settlements 
in the territories is a violation of international law he said 
israel has asked for financial help to cope with the thousands 
of jewish immigrants fleeing the soviet union 
some 11000 immigrants have arrived this year and up to 250000 
refugees are projected to come to israel over the next few years

redoubt volcano erupted again today 
hurling gritty volcanic ash some 30000 feet into the sky where 
wind blew it toward alaskas largest city officials say 
ed wolfe a spokesman for the alaska volcano observatory called 
it a modest eruption similar in energy to one that occurred 
friday 
we recorded it for about 20 minutes wolfe said 
we have pilot reports of a plume with some ash in it up to 
30000 feet or more he said wind trajectories indicate the 
ash will move to the northeast in the direction of anchorage 
he said there was a fair possibility that some of the abrasive 
grit would fall on anchorage but he didnt know how much ash was 
in the plume 
redoubt volcano is 115 miles southwest of anchorage 
the volcano was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions 
began in middecember disrupting air travel and mail in and out of 
anchorage during the holidays because the airborne volcanic ash can 
damage and stall aircraft engines

foreign minister farouk sharaa met with 
former president jimmy carter on wednesday and repeated his 
countrys commitment to helping free foreign hostages in lebanon 
as we did exert a lot of efforts in the past to gain the 
release of so many hostages we are still continuing to exert 
such intensive efforts sharaa told reporters after greeting 
carter at damascus international airport 
the two later held talks at the foreign ministry 
carter who arrived from egypt was due to meet president hafez 
assad before going to jordan on friday he is to finish his 
regional tour in israel 
sharaa said he was not pessimistic that the 18 westerners 
held in lebanon will be freed but carter noted that iranian 
officials believed to have influence over hostageholders have made 
contradictory statements in recent days 
one day its a positive statement the next day its a 
rejection of a positive statement he said but i dont think 
theres any doubt that the leaders of iran have a great influence 
on the future of the hostages carter added 
syria has roughly 40000 troops in lebanon and is the main power 
broker in the country but its allies are often at odds with groups 
believed to hold the hostages 
carter whose own presidency was marred by us diplomats held 
hostage in iran said syrian leaders were very eager to see the 
hostage question solved 
i think its best for relations all around including the 
future of iran as well as lebanonto see the hostage question 
resolved carter said 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
to mark the fifth anniversary of andersons abduction eight 
former french hostages urged the world to remember the westerners 
still held captive and expressed hope wednesday for their speedy 
liberation 
journalist jeanpaul kauffmann drafted the text which was 
distributed by the journalists organization reporters without 
borders 
the hostages are chained they wear a blindfold around their 
eyes their cells have no windows they havent seen the sun for 
years wrote kauffmann 
but the worst of their sufferings is to feel abandoned by 
everyone its the silence that prolongs the ordeal of these people 
we have known and with whom we have suffered he wrote 
the letter was signed by kauffmann roger auque marcel carton 
aurel cornea marcel fontaine georges hansen jeanlouis normandin 
and philippe rochot 
on other issues carter said he hoped for a comprehensive 
settlement of all the issues between israel and its neighbors 
including syria the former president sponsored the 1978 camp david 
accords that led to the israeliegyptian peace treaty 
carter said a us plan for israelipalestinian talks that led 
to the collapse of israels feuding coalition government tuesday 
would be a precedentsetting first step which we hope would lead 
to even broader agreements in the future 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israels hardline likud bloc 
opposes plans to include in the talks palestinians from east 
jerusalem which israel annexed after capturing it from jordan in 
1967

heres an insight that may fail to shock dedicated 
students of the mating game people often tell lies in order to 
have sex honest 
two california researchers reached that conclusion about dating 
behavior after taking a survey of college students 
they say its a point worth keeping in mind when trying to 
decide whether potential sexual partners have ever done anything to 
put themselves at risk of aids 
in the survey 34 percent of male respondents and 10 percent of 
women admitted they had told a lie in order to have sex even 
more said they would lie if a situation arose where it would be to 
their advantage 
the researchers noted that young people are advised to choose 
sexual partners who are at low risk of infection with hiv the aids 
virus one way to do this is to question partners about their 
sexual pasts 
the implications of our findings are clear they wrote in 
thursdays new england journal of medicine patients should be 
cautioned that safesex strategies are always advisable despite 
arguments to the contrary from partners 
the survey which gave no margin of error was based on 
questionnaires filled out by 196 men and 226 women at colleges in 
southern california it was conducted by drs susan d cochran of 
california state university in northridge and vickie m mays of the 
university of california los angeles they published their results 
in a letter to the journal 
in the survey 47 percent of the men and 60 percent of the women 
believed they had been lied to for purposes of sex 
asked about hypothetical situations many people said they would 
be willing to tell lies for instance 20 percent of the men and 4 
percent of the women said they would lie about having negative aids 
tests 
fortythree percent of the men and 34 percent of the women said 
they would never disclose a single episode of cheating 47 percent 
of the men and 42 percent of the women said they would understate 
the number of previous sex partners 
one can probably assume that their reports of their own 
dishonesty underestimate rather than overestimate the problem 
added the researchers who also presented their findings in 1988 at 
the annual meeting of the american psychological association

the world war ii victors and the two 
germanys formally agreed wednesday to invite poland to their talks 
on german reunification when questions concerning that countrys 
borders come up 
the decision was reached at the first formal meeting of the 
soviet union the united states britain and france and the two 
german states on reunification 
the middlelevel talks were part of the socalled 
twoplusfour meetings in which the six nations will examine 
the enormously complex difficulties involved in german unity 
among those issues are the soviet unions insistence that a 
united germany not be a nato member and the fear of some west 
european nations that their own interests might be overlooked 
another is polands worry that a united germany might try to 
claim land ceded to poland after the defeat of nazi germany in 
1945 the land comprises about onethird of presentday poland 
poland had demanded a seat on the unification talks but until 
tuesday west germany opposed that idea 
west german chancellor helmut kohl had angered the poles with 
his previous reluctance to state unequivocally a united germany 
would not seek to claim the polish land he has since said a united 
germany must sign a treaty guaranteeing polands borders but the 
poles are still dissatisfied with his latest stand 
in the east german city of leipzig meanwhile about 300000 
people attended a rally to cheer kohl and his unification program 
dieter kastrup head of the west german delegation at 
wednesdays talks said the officials decided poland should be 
included during some parts of the twoplusfour discussions 
the participants were agreed that poland should be invited as 
soon as questions are discussed that especially concern its 
border kastrup said 
kastrup said the officials held a serious exchange of 
opinions on the agenda for future meetings of the six nations 
and that details of the talks would be kept confidential 
according to kastrup the nations decided to alternate the site 
of the talks between west germany and east germany and that the 
next round would take place directly after east germanys 
elections on sunday no precise date was given 
ministeriallevel talks by the six nations are also planned 
under the twoplusfour formula agreed to last month the east 
german adn news agency said those will begin sometime in late april 
eighteen officials from the six nations met for more than seven 
hours inside the west german foreign ministry the conferees met in 
the afternoon with west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher 
the start of these talks is for us germans a moving occasion 
reminding us how much the situation has changed in europe 
genscher said 
french president francois mitterrand who had been backing 
polands demand for a part in the talks telephoned kohl on 
wednesday to discuss polands participation said west german 
government spokesman hans klein 
besides krabatsch and kastrup other officials attending the 
bonn talks were robert zoellick counselor for the us state 
department anatoly adamischin soviet deputy foreign minister 
john weston political director at the british foreign office and 
bertrand dufourcq political director for the french foreign 
ministry

suppose they held an election and no one 
voted 
thats what happened tuesday when no one showed up for the 
republican primary in this west texas town population 60 
but election officials at precinct 34 in southwest taylor county 
werent really surprised only one person voted in the previous 
primaries 
sheps only republican voter developed cancer and was sent to a 
hospital in houston said county gop chairman brent casey 
the man had been the only gop voter in primaries in 1986 and 
1988 
before 1986 there wasnt even a voting place for republicans in 
shep 250 miles west of dallas republicans had to vote in another 
precinct 
officials opened the republican polling place tuesday hoping to 
attract other voters who were allowed to decide at the last minute 
whether to vote in the democratic or republican gubernatorial 
primary 
we had really hoped that clayton williams might draw some 
people out there because it is a farming community said caseys 
mother betty the precincts election judge williams won the gop 
gubernatorial nomination and is a rancher 
but it is difficult for people who have been democratic for 
years and years to have republican stamped on their voter 
registration 
it was a long boring day for the election judges as they waited 
for voters who never appeared 
we did a lot of reading mrs casey said

the government said wednesday it plans 
to end a massive government program for newly arriving east 
germans apparently in response to pressure to stop the influx 
legal groundwork for the move is being laid in anticipation of 
improved conditions in east germany after elections sunday 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told a news conference 
schaeuble said his government hopes the elections and proposed 
monetary union between the two countries will end the westward 
exodus of east germans seeking a better life 
but he stressed the aid will only be discontinued when we no 
longer need it 
the program includes lodging immigrants in special centers 
lowinterest loans for them and a onetime cash gift of 117 to 
get started on a new life 
about 138000 east germans have moved to west germany so far 
this year schaeuble said an average of 2500 east germans still 
arrive daily last year there were 344000 settlers from east 
germany 
the flood has severely sapped east germanys battered economy 
and strained west germanys social services as well as job and 
housing markets 
several west german state and local governments have already put 
a temporary halt to acceptance of east german resettlers saying 
their communities were overburdened

house democrats on wednesday brushed aside a 
budget proposal by one of their most powerful members and expressed 
skepticism about white house motivations for publicizing it 
at a closed party caucus attended by more than 100 lawmakers 
democrats said they debated spending priorities including how 
deeply to cut pentagon spending in their fiscal 1991 budget 
resolution 
they emphasized that the resolution not the plan put forward 
last weekend by ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski 
would be their partys position if president bush wants to 
negotiate 
rostenkowski dill proposed eliminating the federal deficit 
by freezing most domestic spending for a year including social 
security cutting military spending and raising income taxes and 
fees on gasoline and alcoholic beverages 
bush and his top staff seized on the rostenkowski plan telling 
reporters the administration wants to negotiate even though 
officials disagree with most of the specifics such as raising 
taxes and freezing social securitys costofliving adjustments 
democrats hailed the rostenkowski plan for drawing attention to 
the federal deficit but made clear wednesday they didnt think it 
was a winner except as a political tool for the republicans 
rostenkowski showed that theres some life in the democratic 
party said rep bill alexander dark 
asked if democrats were ready to embrace the plan he said 
no no no adding whats the use if bush would just use 
the plan to attack democrats 
rep larry smith dfla said the administration was hyping the 
rostenkowski plan because its good for them politically 
the white house has been looking for these kind of things 
instead of an honest debate on the issues he said 
theyd love to have that as the bargaining position of the 
democrats said house budget committee chairman leon panetta 
dcalif 
i think they feel they have something to gain by being nice to 
danny he might be nicer to them later about other things in 
his committee said rep barney frank dmass i also think they 
dont mind having a prominent democrat talk about raising taxes i 
think that fits into their political agenda 
the presidents assistants continued their efforts wednesday to 
convince lawmakers that the white house would be serious about 
budget negotiations this year 
treasury secretary nicholas brady in an appearance before the 
house appropriations committee called rostenkowskis plan one 
that we can operate on 
while maintaining that bush made his opposition to tax increases 
quite clear brady also said the president has said that he is 
not going to put anything off the table in negotating with 
congress over the budget 
richard darman bushs budget director met with a group of 
budgetconscious house members led by rep tim penny dwis i 
was left with the sense they will be more flexible on the tax issue 
than may have been previously evident penny said 
but leading democrats said they were in no mood to read tea 
leaves 
nodding and blinking and winking wont do it said rep 
william h gray iii dpa the house majority whip if they feel 
that a bold approach is supportable they ought to say so 
rostenkowski in an appearance on nbctvs today show 
complained about timidity on capitol hill that is somewhat 
frightening he called on citizens to contact their 
representatives 
rostenkowskis office said his mail was running strongly in 
favor of the plan

oliver l north testified wednesday that he 
didnt feel good after lying to congress to conceal secret aid 
to the nicaraguan contras even though he was praised by his boss 
john poindexter 
north concluded 3 days of testimony at poindexters irancontra 
coverup trial by insisting that he violated no laws by lying 
during the aug 6 1986 meeting at the white house with members of 
house permanent select committee on intelligence 
but the former national security council aide told prosecutor 
dan webb that he didnt recall having any emotion when he 
received a note from poindexter after the meeting that said well 
done 
when john poindexter told you well done did you expect he 
had been happy you had carried the water webb asked did you 
think you did well 
no ive told the world i dont feel good about that the 
retired marine lieutenant colonel said his voice cracking with 
emotion 
poindexter a retired navy rear admiral who was president 
reagans national security adviser in 1986 is accused of 
obstructing congressional inquiries into the usiran arms sales 
and the secret operation set up to channel aid to the nicaraugan 
contras 
north conceded that what he did as wrong but not illegal 
you thought you could go in front of those 12 congressmen and 
lie and lie and lie webb asked raising his voice for the first 
time while questioning north 
i was not under oath i have never lied it was an informal 
meeting north said 
did you think this was a tea party going on over there in the 
white house situation room webb asked 
no counsel i knew it wasnt a tea party north said 
north who was declared a hostile witness when he began 
testifying friday earlier said poindexter told him you can 
handle it when he objected to going to the meeting but he balked 
at webbs suggestion that he was under orders to lie 
i never thought it was a good idea to start the process of 
answering their questions north said 
youre not going to change your testimony that you gave this 
jury two days ago to help your former boss webb asked 
no sir north said 
north said poindexter was one of the few people who knew he lied 
did ronald reagan george bush the generals or the admirals 
did any of them send you messages that said well done after you 
lied to congress on aug 6 1986 webb asked 
no north replied 
a key piece of evidence is a note to poindexter from national 
security council staffer robert pearson detailing false information 
north provided about his contrarelated activities to members of 
the house committee during the aug 6 meeting 
the false statements itemized in the note were that north hadnt 
seen contra supporter john singlaub in 20 months didnt meet with 
any frequency with contra liaison robert owen and didnt offer 
military advice to the rebels 
admiral poindexter would have no idea how often you met with 
singlaub would he asked poindexters lawyer richard beckler 
no those are the kinds of details i didnt bother the 
admiral with north said 
us district judge harold greene seem mystified when north told 
beckler that he destroyed documents in his office to protect the 
covert operation to assist the contras when it was exposed in 
october 1986 when a transport plane carrying arms was shot down 
over nicaragua 
the people who were going to look at it if the documents were 
not destroyed were not the kgb and castro but the attorney general 
or the congress of the united states greene said 
later the judge showed exasperation when north couldnt recall 
in detail how he shredded documents in the days before he was fired 
by reagan on nov 25 1986 after the irancontra affair had 
unraveled 
north had a vivid recollection of those events when he testified 
at his own trial last year when he was convicted of aiding and 
abetting an obstruction of congress and the destruction of 
government documents 
didnt that weekend stick out in your mind since it resulted 
in your being fired greene asked north who insisted his 
recollection was vague

the interim parliament passed a new 
election law wednesday giving romanians the legal right to free 
balloting and representative government for the first time in more 
than half a century 
the law governs the may 20 elections to choose a bicameral 
parliament with a prime minister and a popularly elected 
president its passage came after interim president ion iliescu 
fought opposition moves to postpone the vote until fall 
from now on we are on the straightway in our campaign 
iliescu told delegates to the parliament officially known as the 
council of national unity 
the new law formally established universal suffrage in this 
nation of 23 million enfranchising anyone 18 years of age by the 
end of the year 
parliaments lower house will have 387 members elected 
according to both regional and proportional representation in 
deference to the militarys role in the december prodemocracy 
revolution the army high command will name 15 deputies 
senate membership is to depend on a census of the nations 42 
counties with two senators for every county up to 500000 
inhabitants and three for counties with populations above that 
figure the capital will have 14 senators 
at last count 52 political parties and organizations had 
registered the national salvation front the national peasants 
party the national liberal party and the social democratic party 
were considered the frontrunners 
the front has had the major voice in running romania since it 
took power in the revolution that toppled dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
it put iliescu in power set up the current provisional 
government and has dominated the 253member temporary parliament 
the debate over the electoral law gave romanians their first 
taste of legislative giveandtake since before world war ii 
romanias last free elections were in 1937 
the legislation was passed by an informal show of hands in the 
vaulted chamber where ceausescus tame national assembly used to 
meet there were three negative votes 
major opposition parties had argued that a may election was too 
soon after the revolution and gave the national salvation front an 
unfair advantage but iliescu prevailed un observers will be 
invited to monitor the vote 
like the government and parliament the electoral law is 
provisional and applies only to the may elections 
the ensuing parliament will rewrite the constitution to replace 
the ceausescuera document and new elections will be held a year 
after wednesdays law specified 
the law effectively ruled out candidacy for anyone who was part 
of ceausescus apparatus of repression 
delegates voted to bar any candidates who committed human rights 
violations or were guilty of governmentsponsored abuses before the 
revolution if citizens believe a particular candidate was part of 
the ceausescu repression the law provides for a mechanism to allow 
a court challenge

rep doug barnard jr dga said 2327 financial institution 
fraud and embezzlement cases are inactive meaning they are open 
but are not being pursued because of a lack of investigators or 
prosecutors 
of those 1298 involve alleged losses of 100000 or more he 
said 
sampl legislation enacted in august authorized 75 million for 
pursuing bank and thrift fraud this year but the justice 
department sought and received only 50 million barnard said at a 
hearing of his house government operations subcommittee on 
commerce consumer and monetary affairs 
the department devoted an additional 557 employees to pursuing 
fraud 201 fbi agents 118 attorneys and 238 clerks and other 
support staff but that was only a bit more than half of the 1036 
additional employees that field offices had said were needed to 
handle the backlog he said 
our analysis raises the question whether or not the justice 
department will investigate and prosecute the thousand or more 
major cases now on the back burner barnard said 
fbi divisions and us attorneys offices in several areas 
including san diego and pittsburgh asked for more employees but 
received none he said 
other areas did receive a large increase but not nearly 
enough to respond to the problem he said these included 
houston chicago new orleans san antonio texas miami and 
boston he said 
i have some difficulty in accepting that an individual who 
commits substantial fraud against an sampl or bank may completely 
escape investigation and prosecution if that person committed the 
offense in an area which did not receive enough additional 
resources barnard said 
robert j wortham us attorney for the eastern district of 
texas said sampl and bank failures in his region are going 
uninvestigated 
theres no one to go out and do the work he said we have 
asked for resources and not received them i could ask my mother to 
do the work she would be glad to go out there but i dont know if 
she would know what to do 
justice department officials are scheduled to appear before the 
panel thursday a department spokesman had no immediate comment on 
barnards complaints

an uninsured 140 million 
communications satellite failed to separate from its launch rocket 
wednesday and orbited uselessly around earth launch officials said 
efforts were under way to separate the satellite and rocket with 
signals from ground stations while it is attached to the big titan 
3 that boosted it into orbit the satellite cannot be fired into 
the 22300milehigh orbit at which it must operate 
initial review of data suggest separation did not occur 
martin marietta corp said in a onesentence statement 
martin marietta which conducted the launch earlier reported 
that the satellite had separated although the spacecraft failed to 
send any signals back to earth following the 652 am est launch 
if the satellite were doomed it would represent a total 270 
million loss including the cost of the rocket and launch 
the satellite was intended to transmit up to 120000 telephone 
calls simultaneously for several companies and three television 
channels for more than 13 years it was to replace two older 
satellites over the atlantic 
don oneal a spokesman for hughes aircraft co which built the 
satellite earlier said it could be days before the satellite was 
declared a failure 
its not a failure until we can confirm some things here 
said martin marietta spokeswoman judy stowell an investigation 
needs to occur 
the 5ton satellite nearly four stories tall with its antennas 
and solar panels deployed was boosted into orbit by titan 3 the 
most powerful us commercial rocket the rocket blasted off into a 
cloudy sky from the cape canaveral air force station 
launch commentator bob gordon a spokesman for martin marietta 
reported 28 minutes after launch that it had separated from the 
rocket as scheduled a few minutes later he said the separation 
had not been confirmed 
at 837 am gordon announced we have just received 
confirmation of deployment the separation occurred 25 minutes 
after launch he said 
edward m browne president of martin marietta commercial titan 
inc said at a late morning news conference that despite the lack 
of a signal it looks like the rocket performed as it was 
supposed to 
however no data was received from the satellite when it was 
scheduled to pass over a tracking station on hawaii 
hughes earlier said it was not clear whether an onboard rocket 
motor fired to send the satellite into a higher orbit something 
that could not have happened had the orbiter not separated from the 
rocket the motor normally would have fired before the satellite 
sent its first signals back to earth 
the us space command in colorado which tracks objects in 
space said it was asked by martin marietta to locate the satellite 
we are performing our normal tracking function we know where 
it is said maj thomas niemann a command spokesman 
frederick ormsby spacecraft mission director for the 
international telecommunications satellite organization or 
intelsat said the notforprofit international consortium had not 
insured the satellite insuring satellites is prohibitively high 
especially since last months explosion of an ariane rocket 
the unmanned ariane rocket carrying two japanese communications 
satellites blew apart over the atlantic shortly after taking off 
from kourou french guiana 
the intelsat vi that took off wednesday was the fourth 
commercial launch of a payload to orbit by an american company 
the satellite was scheduled to reach final orbit 22300 miles 
above earth on sunday and then undergo tests before being placed 
in service in late may 
the first intelsat vi launched october by the european space 
agencys ariane rocket is being tested in orbit and will be placed 
in service april 7 
wednesdays launch was the 44th for intelsat a washington 
dcbased commercial cooperative of 118 member nations the 
cooperative owns and operates a global communications satellite 
system used by more than 170 countries the first intelsat 
communications satellite was launched 25 years ago next month

lawmakers on wednesday decided that they rather 
than the soviet people should elect the countrys new powerful 
president mikhail s gorbachev was the only name on the ballot 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov and interior minister vadim a 
bakatin were nominated for the post by a group calling itself 
soyuz or union which is opposed to efforts by soviet 
republics to break away but both withdrew 
balloting was to begin wednesday night and results were expected 
thursday morning 
gorbachev needed a simple majority in the 2250member congress 
of peoples deputies the soviet parliament on tuesday it approved 
his plan to greatly increase the powers of the presidency and 
create a multiparty system 
gorbachev narrowly cleared a procedural vote wednesday allowing 
the parliament to elect him directly to a fiveyear term he needed 
1497 votes in that vote 
the final tally was 1542368 with 76 deputies abstaining more 
than 200 deputies either boycotted the vote or were absent making 
it even more difficult for gorbachev to muster the required 
twothirds majority 
if gorbachev had lost he would have been forced to face 
disgruntled citizens in a national election campaign this year to 
keep the job he has held since 1988 
the decision to hold the emergency election in the congress of 
peoples deputies came after a respected scholar warned that the 
soviet union was not yet ready for a nationwide presidential 
campaign 
leningrad historian dmitri likhachev considered by many the 
dean of soviet culture said the country would face civil war if it 
had to go through its first presidential election now 
i remember the revolution of february 1917 very well and i 
know where emotions can lead the 84yearold likhachev told the 
deputies referring to the revolution that ended more than 300 
years of rule by the romanov dynasty 
understand our conditions he said direct election of the 
president will lead to civil war 
gorbachev was nominated for the post by the communist party 
central committee which met hurriedly during a break in the 
session the official tass news agency said 
bakatin withdrew from the race when deputies began to debate his 
candidacy ryzhkov told the parliament he preferred to remain in 
his present post 
several deputies took the floor to say they were appalled that 
parliament was unable to come up with a viable alternative to 
gorbachev 
under constitutional amendments approved tuesday the new 
president will have wide powers to propose legislation negotiate 
treaties veto bills and decisions of the council of ministers 
appoint a cabinet declare war if the country is attacked and under 
certain conditions impose presidential rule 
gorbachevs latest political reform concentrates in one person 
many of the powers now held collectively by the presidium of the 
supreme soviet legislature gorbachev as chairman of the 
presidium has been considered the countrys president but with 
far less personal power 
most of his personal power still stems from his post as 
communist party chief but gorbachev is trying to strengthen the 
government while ending the partys lock on political power there 
is speculation that he eventually may give up the party leadership 
and remain president 
likhachev warned that a proposal to force gorbachev to resign 
his chairmanship of the communist party if elected president would 
pit the party against the state he said that also could lead to 
civil war 
sympathetic deputies broke into applause at the end of his 
statement 
gorbachev previously has said a stronger presidency was needed 
to hold the soviet system together under the strains of economic 
problems and ethnic disputes

saying that the future vitality of our 
nation depends on the quality of child care a national research 
council committee on wednesday called for a 5 billion to 10 
billion boost in government support for americas day care system 
a 19member nrc committee in a report entitled who cares for 
americas children also recommended that the government 
establish strict national standards for day care centers 
and aiming to get parentchild relationships off to a good 
start it said the federal government should require companies to 
allow unpaid jobprotected leave for employed parents of infants 
up to one year old 
the report said that more than half of all american parents now 
entrust their young children to the care of others during part of 
the day and that by the year 2000 between 70 percent and 80 
percent of all american children will have mothers in the work 
force 
every american child not only deserves quality care the 
future vitality of our nation depends on it said the committees 
chairman john l palmer a professor at the maxwell school of 
citizenship and public affairs at syracuse university 
quality of child care can affect the wellbeing of virtually a 
generation of american children the report said because the 
nation now depends on working mothers as a permanent part of the 
economic structure 
women in the work force are here to stay said dr jack p 
shonkoff a professor of pediatrics at the university of 
massachusetts medical school and a member of the committee we 
need them in the work force but we must make sure that families 
have quality child care available 
shonkoff said careful study showed no evidence that day care in 
the first year of life is detrimental to children if the quality is 
good but poor quality care he said has been shown to put 
children at risk of poor outcomes in life including slow 
progress in school inappropriate aggression a lack of job skills 
and a greater tendency to drop out of school 
of particular interest is the finding that outofhome quality 
child care can offset to some extent the detrimental effects on 
development of a stressful impoverished home environment said 
palmer the bottom line of this research is that quality matters 
in child care 
the report called for a uniform national standard for child 
care this could include minimum safety and health standards along 
with acceptable ranges for stafftochild ratios group size 
caregiver qualifications and physical space 
the committee repeatedly said in its 347page report that there 
is a scarcity of quality child care in the us but committee 
member barbara bowman of the erikson institute in chicago said 
there are no comprehensive statistics on this 
she said more than half of all children of working parents are 
cared for in facilities that are unregulated and as a result 
national data is lacking 
research in limited areas showed that only about 20 percent of 
care arrangements meet the standards of good or better but 
this cannot be extended to the nation as a whole ms bowman said 
children from disadvantaged families the report said are 
more apt to be entrusted to low quality child care because the 
higher quality care is expensive 
committee member andrew cherlin professor of sociology at johns 
hopkins university in baltimore said that although child care 
legislation was passed in the 1980s the federal help is in the 
form of tax credits that benefit middle and upper class families 
not the poor that need help the most 
sen edward m kennedy dmass called the nrc report right 
on the mark and said it shows that congress should break the 
stalemate by passing legislation to assure quality child care 
a bill was passed by the senate last fall but a similar measure 
is now stalled in the house 
helen blank of the childrens defense fund said the nrc report 
shows that congress is still behind the curve in attempting to 
correct the nations child care problems 
she said a bill currently in committee in the house would 
provide about 175 billion in child care subsidies 
the nrc committee said governments at all levels need to 
increase support of quality child care in various forms by an 
additional 5 billion to 10 billion a year the committee made no 
specific recommendation of how the money was to be spent or 
distributed 
on capitol hill congressional staffers said house leaders were 
moving toward agreement on a compromise bill with house speaker 
thomas s foley pressing key members to resolve differences on the 
bill 
the staffers speaking on condition of anonymity said leaders 
of the education and labor committee were expected to agree to a 
ways and means committee proposal to finance child care in the 
states through increased money for an existing block grant 
entitlement program rather than through direct aid 
ms blank said the bill now being considered by the house would 
not mandate specific child care center standards but would require 
states to have some standards and would make recommendations about 
what they should be

academy of sciences a private society of scholars chartered by

the united states rejected on wednesday 
demands by nelson mandela the prominent black activist for a 
break in relations with south africa and stiffer economic sanctions 
in the hope of forcing an end to racial separation in the country 
secretary of state james a baker iii meanwhile made 
arrangements for a fivehour visit to capetown next thursday for 
talks with president fw de klerk anglican bishop desmond tutu 
and other black opponents of apartheid 
baker has invited mandela to meet with him in namibia on tuesday 
or wednesday while the secretary of state is attending ceremonies 
in windhoek marking the independence of the former south african 
colony 
mandela freed last month from prison by de klerk after serving 
27 years has been on a visit to stockholm and has not formalized 
arrangements to see baker in windhoek said a us official who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
baker flies to namibia on sunday he has scheduled a meeting in 
zaire with president mobutu sese seko before flying back to 
washington on march 23 
baker also may see president jose eduardo dos santos of angola 
in namibia and jonas savimbi the leader of a usbacked rebel 
movement against the angolan government in zaire the official 
said 
on tuesday mandela called on foreign governments to break 
diplomatic relations with south africa and to impose tougher 
economic sanctions to speed political change in the country 
rejecting the demands margaret d tutwiler the state 
department spokeswoman said 
we believe it is more constructive to continue our relations 
with south africa we have played a helpful role in supporting 
negotiations between these parties we do not believe that this is 
the best way to pursue being constructive and helpful in this 
area 
similarly on mandelas call for tougher sanctions ms tutwiler 
read from a statement we believe we can best play a helpful role 
in support of negotiations by maintaining contacts with both 
sides 
besides the spokeswoman said the bush administration intends 
to comply with a 1986 law requiring south africa to free all 
political prisoners repeal the 3yearold state of emergency and 
make other reforms before the sanctions can be lifted 
these things have not yet been done and we intend to 
follow the law in close consultation with congress ms tutwiler 
said 
mandela said in stockholm on tuesday that the help that we 
require firstly is an intensification of sanctions and secondly 
the cutting of diplomatic ties with south africa 
the statement read by ms tutwiler said the call for stiffer 
sanctions historically has been the position of the african 
national congress and mr mandela has been careful not to depart 
from it 
however the spokeswoman added mr mandela and the anc have 
also made clear they appreciate the role western countries with 
relations with south africa have played in pressing pretoria for an 
end to apartheid

greeted by sirens and shouts susan butcher 
stormed into this gold rush town wednesday in subzero weather and 
record time to rack up her fourth victory in five years in the 
1158 mile iditarod trail sled dog race 
butcher 33 of manley became only the second fourtime winner 
of the 18yearold anchoragetonome marathon 
butcher was running about two hours ahead of defending champion 
joe runyan of nenana a reversal of positions from the 1989 finish 
runyan won that race with a onehour fiveminute cushion over 
butcher 
butcher finished with 11 dogs during her 11 days on the trail 
she had to drop three veteran dogs that pulled her to her previous 
victories she credited her unknown canines for the victory 
this team has been absolutely incredible butcher said 
ive never had a team go as strong as this 
i dont know whats in that team that could do it but it must 
be the combination working together theres been no strong dog 
emerge from this group 
her official time was 11 days 1 hour 53 minutes and 23 
seconds that is an alltime record beating by more than 10 
minutes her 1987 mark of 11 days 2 hours and 5 minutes which was 
set on another route 
the previous record for the northern route also set by butcher 
in 1986 was 11 days 15 hours and 6 minutes 
butcher said it was extraordinary to break the record on the 
slightly longer northern route 
this team had power coming out of its ears she said not 
so much charging up hills but stamina it just had it 
she wins 50000 in firstplace money plus 25000 from purina 
pro plan one of her sponsors 
the rest of the 200000 purse will be split among the next 19 
finishers 
the record time came as a surprise this year the 70 mushers who 
began the race march 3 had to contend with the deepest snow in a 
quartercentury ash from redoubt volcano some unseasonably warm 
days that tired their dogs buffalo on the trail and marauding 
moose 
forced to forage in shoulderdeep snow moose are especially 
aggressive this winter at least two mushers had runins with the 
huge animals with tangled their lines and stomped their dogs 
the only other fourtime winner is rick swenson who was leading 
out of mcgrath near the halfway point swenson of trapper creek 
had to turn back and have his team checked by a veterinarian after 
one such encounter 
that cost him the race swenson was running in sixth place 
wednesday 
people emptied out of bars and stores as butcher headed down 
front street to cross under the large burl sign that symbolizes the 
finish line 
nomes populaton of 3000 roughly doubles during the iditarod as 
the community is host of an amateur basketball tournament involving 
53 teams from more than a dozen villages in northern and western 
alaska 
in addition to her four victories butcher has finished second 
three times and among the top 10 four other times 
the only other woman to win the grueling race libby riddles of 
nome watched the finish on sunny streets in minus 10degree 
temperatures 
she outraced these guys she maintained her dog team better 
riddles said you make your luck 
the iditarod named after an old supply route to the gold mining 
districts of interior alaska draws its inspiration from a 1925 
relay of diptheria serum from nenana to nome which was hit hard by 
an outbreak of the disease 
butcher began 68th of 70 mushers but moved into the lead just 
after the halfway point and alternated with runyan and lavon barve 
of wasilla as the teams reached the windblown bering sea coast near 
the end 
breaking away from runyan and barve she took the lead for good 
monday in the treacherous nighttime crossing of 30 miles of ice 
covering norton bay 
seven teams dropped out and one team was disqualified 
the remaining teams were strung out 600 miles back and will be 
straggling into nome for a week or more

estimated the dam break could produce a rise of 1 to 2 feet in the 
river at his city the river already had been rising about an inch 
every hour and was about 12 to 14 inches from the top of its banks 
as of 1130 am he said

seventyeight tornadoes were reported tuesday 25 in kansas 
alone said ed ferguson deputy director of the national severe 
storms forecast center in kansas city he said he expected the

day any time in the season he said 
nebraska reported 16 twisters iowa had 15 oklahoma reported 
14 illinois sighted six and two were reported in texas he said 
the unusual aspect is that the severe activity extended so far

weather in northern states to come later in the season 
the worst of the tornadoes damaged 75 to 100 homes in hesston 
kan 35 miles north of wichita ferguson said 
the two deaths occurred near kansas towns of burrton and 
goessel near hesston

little over that it was on the ground for 2 hours the average 
tornado is on the ground only for a couple of miles ferguson 
said 
extensive damage in hesston prompted authorities to cordon off 
the town of 4000 on wednesday barricading all roads and guarding 
heavily damaged residential areas and businesses a highway patrol

it was the citys bloodiest 24 hours this year a 
mother was gunned down wielding a pitchfork to protect her son from 
suspected gang members and a woman was fatally shot at her store 
over a jar of easter seal coins 
six separate shootings and stabbings left three people dead and 
four wounded between 1 pm tuesday and 1 pm wednesday and 
pushed bostons murder rate 50 percent higher than during the same 
period last year 
it was a night of violence no city should have to put up 
with police deputy superintendent william celester who runs the 
citys toughest precinct area b in roxbury said wednesday 
the next morning the community lives in fear 
the violence erupted during a beautiful sunny day a day so 
warm it tied a record for the date it occurred in roxbury 
dorchester mattapan and jamaica plain bostons poorest 
neighborhoods 
it left the city with 31 people dead of homicide this year up 
from 21 during the same period last year 
police cited at least four other 24hour periods since 1973 as 
having more homicides but said the latest violence ranked among 
the worst in city history 
the violence began when 57yearold jean strandberg was shot in 
the temple at the liquor store in dorchester where she worked for 
more than 20 years two robbers fled with a jar of coins collected 
for easter seals police said 
she was the nicest person on the face of the earth said 
jody gatwinn a coworker she was the best friend of a lot of 
people 
police arrested michael adams 17 of boston on the 
secondfloor porch of a nearby tenement after the shooting 
witnesses said he was carrying a shotgun and that a second youth 
had been seen fleeing 
the jar of coins donated to help disabled children was smashed 
on a sidewalk the pennies nickels and dimes and a few quarters 
scattered police said the change no more than 10 was all that 
was taken in the robbery 
adams pleaded innocent in dorchester district court at a tense 
hearing during which judge darrell outlaw decried the constant 
crime and suggested that the national guard may eventually need to 
come in to quell the violence 
something drastic has to take place outlaw said these 
are unusual times and they call for unusual measures 
around 830 pm tuesday delores newberry 33 a mother of 
five was shot in the chest as she chased at least two youths who 
were apparently trying to set fire to her roxbury apartment police 
said she picked up a pitchfork to protect her son before being 
fatally shot 
newberrys family has been nearly decimated by street violence 
her husband was shot in the heart at a housing project last summer 
newberrys sister was shot to death by her boyfriend on a street in 
1987 
about 90 minutes before newberrys slaying 30yearold carl 
benbow was found shot in the head near a roxbury housing project 
and taken to brigham and womens hospital where he was pronounced 
dead police said the boston globe reported that a man who said he 
was benbows brother and identified himself only as the 
terminator promised revenge 
they just erupted guerrilla warfare the brother was quoted 
as saying you are going to have to take me in for a homicide 
police commissioner francis m roache mayor raymond flynn and 
celester all echoed a similar refrain when calling for a halt to 
the violence tighter gun control 
weve got to get the illegal guns out of the hands of drug 
runners flynn said when he arrived at the scene of benbows 
slaying tuesday night 
two 19yearolds ernesto morrison and nathaniel chaney both of

central kansas residents were confronted by 
rubble piles that once were their homes wednesday in the wake of a 
slowmoving tornado that killed two people 
it came right across the trees that are splintered over 
there said lowell good whose home was one of the first hit

cops producer paul stojanovich was out of 
breath as he whispered the cryptic instructions 
were about to do a drug bust he told a reporter ill 
meet you at the peter pan motel room 38 
minutes later in a seedy area bathed by the neon glare of the 
downtown areas glitter gulch las vegas metro police burst into 
room 38 a startled drug seller and his customers found themselves 
under arrest and the subjects of the cops film crew 
cops is a new genre of cop show liveontape action 
courtesy of the culprits boy wouldnt joe friday have been 
jealous 
the halfhour series is leading fox broadcastings saturday 
night lineup averaging a 70 nielsen rating and a 13 percent share 
of the viewers in its time period according to the networks 
audience estimates 
it still lags well behind its competition which currently 
consists of abcs new help nbcs alf and cbs 
paradise but fox ratings tend to be lower because the network 
has fewer stations carrying its programs a total of 130 compared 
to more than 200 stations for each major network 
the evolution of cops dates to 1981 when stojanovich tailed 
a narcotics unit to produce a show called cocaine blues 
he approached the networks with the cops idea two years ago 
and fox bought the concept airing the first episode in january 
1989 
cops since has visited a host of cities including miami 
portland ore new orleans san diego and los angeles and 
recently filmed a series of shows in the soviet union 
police departments across the country kept suggesting las vegas 
the neighbor of north las vegas the locale of nbcs new nasty 
boys police series so stojanovich and company came here in 
january for two weeks of filming 
the results of their visit will air as a onehour cops 
special april 7 
the officers bursting through the vegas motel room door found a 
gun on the premises but no shots were fired the cops camera 
crew wearing bulletproof vests was right behind as officers 
broke into the room 
most of our guys have done combat or heavy news stojanovich 
said of the crew members these guys are good 
across the nation the crews have put on film a wide spectrum of 
an officers tour of duty from domestic disputes to drug deals 
car chases to homicide investigations 
stojanovich said hes found himself in some touchy situations 
since taking on cops 
we were shooting a multikilo drug bust in florida with the dea 
when things got out of control he recalled it took 10 
officers to take this one guy down and im caught in the middle 
suddenly i find myself standing next to one of the suspects and 
the other officers were involved with trying to control the one 
guy i just stared at the other suspect i hoped he thought i was a 
cop or something 
the worst injury to a crew member so far was an ankle broken in 
a foot pursuit in miami stojanovich said 
while shooting in las vegas the cops crew went along on a 
call from a battered wife and had to watch as two young children 
screamed while their feuding parents were taken away 
that can be really upsetting stojanovich said 
on another night the crew happened on a car accident as they 
were filming the traffic officer on the scene was run down and 
badly injured by a drunken driver in a pickup truck 
you never know what the next call is going to turn into 
stojanovich said 
the message of the show 
we try to show that so many cop shows are unrealistic the 
guys are glorified theyre heroes in reality police work is 
often very tedious he said we hope to educate the public on 
what the police are up against we try to make some sanity out of 
the insanity 
homicides are some of the toughest crimes to film and to work 
stojanovich said 
most people dont realize how grim it is until they see it 
from a cops perspective he said the detectives have to make 
some sense out of it it explodes the myth of colombo you dont 
always get the guy cops dont have screenwriters to write their 
scenario their finish

lawmakers governors aides lobbyists and 
government workers gather once a week in the room used as the 
states nerve center during hurricane hugo for an activity they say 
goes beyond politics and eases statehouse stress 
instead of discussing an upcoming bill they reviewed a passage 
from matthew during a recent bible study session in the governors 
conference room in the capitol 
the 20 participants who came to the 730 am meeting on a 
drizzling wednesday put aside any political differences for 45 
minutes and left with a sense of spiritual fulfillment 
god is not a politician this is fellowship said elliott d 
thompson former chairman of the alcoholic beverage and control 
commission who is now a lawyer and lobbyist 
for the past three years gov carroll campbells deputy chief 
of staff bob mcalister has organized the informal bible study 
sessions campbell a republican does not attend but several 
democratic lawmakers do 
i think it indicates that there are more important things in 
life than politics and that the preeminant question of life is 
spiritual mcalister said 
participants bring their wellworn bibles grab a cup of coffee 
in the governors office and sit around the large wooden table 
usually host to budget and control board meetings the room also is 
used by campbell for news conferences and served as one of his 
command posts during hugo in september 
sen yancey mcgill dkingstree joined at the start of the 
legislation session in january and said he has grown close to the 
others in the group 
lawmakers have a lot of pressure on us from day to day not 
only here in columbia but in the district at home mcgill said 
i think the study of gods word is the most important thing to me 
and it certainly strengthens and really assists me in making 
decisions on a daily basis 
mcgill said he feels total relaxation during the gatherings 
rep david beasley dsociety hill said an inconsequential 
benefit from the meetings is a better look at how the governors 
office works 
beasley said he has learned more about some of campbells staff 
through bible study 
the only people who go are pretty committed to christian 
causes christian ethics and that tells you a lot right there 
about someone beasley said if theyre in that posture 
theyre more apt to do whats right then it opens up an automatic 
friendship and we can just sit down and discuss things because 
theres automatically a mutal respect 
the rev donald l burnett pastor at st andrews evangelical 
church moderates 
there are many issues we disagree on but we can agree on 
essential things he said 
mcalister however is the driving force behind the bible study 
which began three years ago with three others as the original 
members 
mcalisters religious beliefs earned public attention in the 
days before the scheduled execution of inmate rusty woomer in 1989 
mcalister who has ministered to inmates over the past five years 
befriended woomer as a result of visits to death row to share 
christian fellowship 
campbell rejected woomers appeal for clemency but the us 
supreme court has delayed the execution 
campbell knows about the bible study meetings but has chosen not 
to attend mcalister said 
ive never asked him to because the dynamics of the group 
would change mcalister said i think he and i talked about it 
and his presence might mean youd have others coming for the 
wrong motivation

tucked away near the end of the 
administrations 129page transportation policy is a brief and 
general pledge to work for oil conservation a faint echo of the 
energy crisis that dominated the national agenda not so long ago 
in the era of the oil embargo of gasoline lines and rocketing 
prices that spiraled inflation energy was a major problem for two 
presidents and a dominant political issue during much of the 1970s 
now it is backofthebook stuff despite increasing us dependence 
on imported oil 
imports an embargo and a cut in foreign oil supplies were 
components of the energy crises that confronted richard m nixon 
and beset jimmy carter they advocated policies to make sure it 
couldnt happen again 
but it could 
oil imports in january were the highest in 12 years imports 
have been rising domestic oil production falling prices are down 
which makes foreign oil less expensive than the alternatives but 
it certainly isnt inexpensive oil imports account for about 50 
billion of the persistent us trade deficit 
according to the american petroleum institute imported oil 
accounted for 54 percent of us consumption in january a record 
high cia director william webster has told congress that reliance 
on persian gulf oil is likely to increase markedly over the next 
several years 
nixon launched project independence seeking to end us 
dependence on foreign energy sources after the arab oil embargo it 
didnt happen carter said in 1977 the nation should declare the 
moral equivalent of war to master its energy problems carter later 
was taunted with his programs acronym meow parts of his program 
were shelved as some others expired they were not renewed 
the crises eased foreign oil became plentiful and relatively 
cheap and ronald reagans administration pushed the whole issue 
far down the agenda slashing the energy conservation budget and 
proposing unsuccessfully that congress eliminate the department 
of energy 
now bushs department of energy is at work on a new national 
energy strategy with the initial version due next month and the 
final report before the end of the year 
it will have to be a companion piece to the transportation 
policy statement which observes 
transportation accounts for more than a quarter of total 
national energy consumption and close to twothirds of the 
petroleum used in the united states each year 
it goes on to say that conservation and more efficient motor 
vehicles have led to significant energy savings in the past two 
decades and that there is more to come 
the transportation policy pledges to foster development and 
use of more fuelefficient vehicles and transportation 
operations there are no specific recommendations on the 
politically and economically sensitive issue of future fuel economy 
standards to be required of us automobile manufacturers 
the requirements were relaxed during reagans second term 
secretary of transportation samuel k skinner reinstated them for 
the 1990 model year requiring that cars produced by each us 
manufacturer get an average 275 miles per gallon of gas congress 
may act later this year on amendments to the fuel economy rules set 
after the 19731974 arab oil embargo 
noting that some forms of travel are more energyefficient than 
others in meeting the same needs the transportation policy says 
that mass transit and inter city rail service can serve as 
fuelsaving alternatives to the private automobile in heavily 
populated areas 
it also proposes to end operating subsidies and reduce other 
federal spending for mass transit and rail passenger service so 
that passengers cities and states will pick up the cost 
the theory is that those are local and regional not national 
facilities and so should be paid for locally and regionally that 
may not mesh with a transportation strategy in which conserving oil 
is a national aim 
but then theres no crisis now

the safety measures set up in prince 
william sound since the wreck of the exxon valdez are impressive 
oil skimmers lie waiting in remote bays and powerful tugs trail 
every tanker leaving port 
the hostile glare of publicity forced the improvements in 
alaska but critics say the oil industry has a long way to go 
toward preventing and cleaning up spills elsewhere in the nation 
what oil companies do best is discover produce ship and 
market oil cleaning spills is not their bag said walt parker 
chairman of an alaska state task force that studied the valdez 
spill theyll do as much as they have to and no more 
the us house has passed a bill that would allow states to 
adopt stricter spill liability laws than the federal government and 
require double hulls on all tankers in us waters 
a conference committee now is trying to reconcile differences 
with a weaker senate bill which calls for more study on double 
hulls and leaves the final decision up to the secretary of 
transportation 
legislatures in nearly every seaboard state are considering 
proposals to increase tanker and oil barge safety or improve spill 
cleanup capabilities 
large spills are something we face in all our port areas 
said sarah chasis attorney for the natural resources defense 
council a new yorkbased environmental group there will always 
be a certain number of oil spills but many measures can be taken 
to reduce their likelihood 
oil companies hoped to head off some of the legislative furor 
last june by announcing a 250 million fiveyear plan to create a 
nationwide network of spillresponse teams but it has stalled as 
the companies watch what action congress and the states take 
the public outrage over the exxon valdez accident last march 24 
has been kept alive by a string of messy fuel spills around the 
country 
in the past year at least 81 spills of more than 5000 gallons 
occurred in the united states said spill expert richard golob of 
cambridge mass 
the most significant ones according to his newsletter golobs 
oil pollution bulletin 
june 23 the greek tanker world prodigy hit a reef off rhode 
island spilling 420000 gallons of heating oil the same day a 
barge collided with a tanker in texas spilling 252000 gallons of 
slurry oil into the houston ship channel the next day a uruguayan 
tanker ran aground in the delaware river spilling 300000 gallons 
of fuel oil 
jan 1 an underwater pipeline running from an exxon refinery 
ruptured spilling 567000 gallons of heating oil into arthur kill 
a busy industrial waterway between new jersey and new yorks staten 
island 
feb 7 the american trader chartered by british petroleum 
was gored by its own anchor and spilled nearly 400000 gallons of 
alaskan crude oil off huntington beach in southern california 
feb 28march 6 three accidents within a week leaked a total 
of 160000 gallons of crude fuel and heating oil into new jerseys 
arthur kill and adjoining kill van kull 
except for the massive exxon valdez spill which totaled about 
108 million gallons the accidents were business as usual for the 
oil transportation industry golob said 
professionals in the oilpollution field know that oil spills 
take place on a regular basis he said the main difference 
this year is the extensive media coverage of oil spills in 1988 a 
spill of 1 million gallons might have occupied a oneinch story in 
the new york times in 1989 a spill that large would have taken 
over half the page 
as oil from the american trader washed up on southern california 
beaches stores sold tshirts proclaiming crude is rude dude 
and campaigning politicians held so many shoreside press 
conferences that the mayor of huntington beach asked for advance 
notice so they wouldnt interfere with cleanup efforts 
an oilspill measure previously given little chance of passage 
was put on the fast track in the california assembly it would 
tighten control of tanker traffic and create a 500 million cleanup 
fund from a 50centabarrel tax on crude oil brought into the 
state 
other states considering strengthened controls include 
louisiana where state wildlife officials want double hulls on all 
tankers using state waters and rhode island where a bill 
introduced with the state attorney generals blessing would make 
oil shippers assume unlimited liability for damages caused by 
spills even if no negligence is proved 
environmentalists are cheered by the explosion of legislative 
action especially the us house proposal for doublehulled 
tankers a requirement repeatedly defeated by the oil industry for 
nearly 20 years 
the oil industry argues that double hulls could make ships more 
unstable in major accidents and says the cost of building new 
tankers or retrofitting old ones would be high only 10 percent of 
the worlds fleet of 3200 large tankers have double hulls or 
double bottoms said american petroleum institute spokesman bill 
taylor 
but chasis the attorney for the environmental group said 
studies have shown double hulls or bottoms would prevent or greatly 
limit most spills 
the cost of one major oil spill like the exxon valdez which 
is 2 billion and mounting could pay for the increased cost of 
building 100 or more tankers with double hulls she said

marilyn helding 65yearold widow of a 
wisconsin vegetable farmer thought the money from her husbands 
estate vanished like crops in the dust bowl when windsor capital 
corp went out of business 
i nearly went crazy when they went under mrs helding said 
from her home in franksville wis i didnt know what to do 
a few months after the small milwaukee brokerage collapsed under 
apparent mismanagement in march 1988 mrs helding regained her 
entire stock portfolio and 45000 in cash the firm owed her 
the message if your broker goes bust your investment doesnt 
have to 
with the recent collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc two 
other brokerage bankruptcy court filings in the last year and 
widely publicized problems at several wall street firms the safety 
of customer accounts is drawing attention 
an agency established by congress after a rash of brokerage 
house failures in the late 1960s protects investors who may have 
thought their account went down the drain with the company that 
managed it 
the securities investor protection corp has a 485 million fund 
that insures individual accounts for up to 500000 including up 
to 100000 in cash large brokerages also have insurance for 
larger amounts 
tapping into the protection fund is a last resort if a 
brokerage firm goes belly up sipc first tries to arrange a 
transfer of customer accounts to another firm 
the basic intention is that a customer should not lose assets 
or property because the broker with whom he is doing business has 
encountered financial difficulty said theodore h focht sipcs 
president and general counsel 
sipc pronounced sippick covers all forms of stock and bond 
holdings but not commodities it also does not guarantee the 
underlying value of a customer account for example if xyz co is 
trading at 50 a share when a brokerage folds but falls to 5 at 
reimbursement time the customer loses the difference 
it does not insure you for market losses said irving 
picard a new york bankruptcy lawyer who has served as a 
courtappointed sipc trustee in three liquidation cases if you 
think the broker defrauded you thats not protected by the sipc 
fund 
in the 19 years since its creation sipc has handled 212 cases 
and paid 185 million to satisfy customer claims if a firm cant 
immediately pay sipc will advance the money to customers and try 
to collect later 
sipc officials estimate that cash and securities worth 14 
billion have been returned to about 240000 investors mostly 
through account transfers a total of 305 claims worth 31 million 
have not been satisfied primarily because of legal challenges 
the sipc fund comparable to the federal deposit insurance corp 
for commercial banks is fed by required contributions from the 
nations 12000 or so registered brokerdealers 
the washingtonbased agency also has 500 million in bank credit 
and a 1 billion line to the us treasury neither resource has 
been tapped on top of that about 25 firms have private coverage 
of up to 5 million per account 
before sipc was signed into law by president nixon on dec 30 
1970 selfregulatory organizations the national association of 
securities dealers and the stock exchanges set aside funds to 
protect customers of collapsed firms 
but in the late 1960s wall street was hit with a rash of 
failures when the market slumped as firms spent large sums to 
computerize when its customer protection kitty dried up the new 
york stock exchange was forced to dip into a building fund to 
safeguard investors fearing the worst the exchanges lobbied 
congress for help 
there were six sipc cases last year five involved a total of 
under 50 claims the most cases in one year was 40 in 1972 during 
a recession a rash of financial fraud was partly responsible for 
46 cases from 198185 
sipcs largest payout 325 million involved the 1983 criminal 
fraudrelated collapse of bell amp beckwith of toledo ohio the 
demise of fitzgerald dearman amp roberts inc of tulsa okla 
involved the most customer accounts 50000 sipc has doled out 
55 million since that case began in june 1988 
sipc can get involved when a brokerdealer enters bankruptcy 
court proceedings when a trustee or receiver is appointed to run a 
firm when a firm fails to meet federal requirements or when it 
cant demonstrate compliance 
a brokerage can request a sipcrun liquidation or sipc can ask 
the securities and exchange commission to seek a court order for 
one 
drexel for example was not placed in a sipc proceeding because 
only its parent company filed for federal bankruptcy court 
protection and the firm is liquidating orderly plus drexel sold 
most retail accounts to smith barney harris upham amp co last year 
and the rest went to shearson lehman hutton inc after the 
bankruptcy filing

two volumes of letters from simone de beauvoir to 
her lifetime companion jeanpaul sartre provide graphic details 
on the famous couples private life and critics say the french 
feminist philosopher emerges as predatory opportunistic and macho 
lettres a sartre letters to sartre published in 
february by gallimard along with de beauvoirs journal de 
guerre war journal recount in the most minute detail the 
daily routine of the author of the second sex the bible of 
feminists around the world 
the letters are responses to sartres own letters to de 
beauvoir which were published in 1983 as lettres au castor 
the title sartres favorite term of endearment for de beauvoir 
beaver 
her correspondence was thought to have been lost until the 
couples adopted daughter sylvie le bon de beauvoir found the 
letters by chance in a closet still wrapped in their original 
envelopes addressed to monsieur sartre or soldier sartre 
some french critics wish the letters had stayed in the closet 
this asphyxiating outpouring is a crime against the castor 
wrote marianne alphant in the daily liberation 
what do the letters teach us she asks that the pioneer 
of feminism only liked women she could dominate that this austere 
muse was as moody and jealous as a simple housewife that the 
novelist so thrilled with her little inventions was only a master 
recycler 
the letters also prove alphant wrote that de beauvoirs 
successful autobiography la force dage was rigged and full 
of falsifications 
other critics were less harsh josyane savigneau of le monde 
argued that the letters show how the couple respected the 
contract of transparency complete honesty at all costs 
which became their credo in 1929 and endured until sartres death 
in 1980 
in the letters de beauvoir details her love affairs with a male 
student of sartres and with some of her own women students 
including louise vedrine and nathalie sorokine 
hoping to add a little spice to sartres dull life as a 
german prisoner of war in 193940 she provides graphic and 
sometimes sordid details about what her lovers wore what they 
said how they behaved in bed and even how they smelled 
in bed vedrine throws herself passionately in my arms these 
sensual swoonings seem so terribly organic de beauvoir wrote 
when i wake up i feel like a fat sated man because i avoid 
caresses i think only about breakfast and about my work 
de beauvoir wrote that sex was a chore yet she was fascinated 
with brothels prostitutes and other forms of low life that her 
buttonedup bourgeois upbringing had made taboo 
at times she comes across as downright conniving if wanda 
says anything about me be sure to tell me so i can know if my 
charm offensive is working she wrote 
for alphant de beauvoirs behavior towards women was predator 
and macho linked to an ambiguous desire to play the role of the 
man 
but she was equally aggressive with men something extremely 
pleasant has happened to me something i never expected i slept 
with the little bost three days ago naturally i was the one to 
suggest it she wrote to sartre in 1938 bosts first name was 
not given 
im very fond of him we spend idyllic days and passionate 
nights together the relationship is something precious and 
strong but superficial too and easy just an agreeable 
fulfillment of relations that had always been pleasant 
nonetheless the overriding theme in the letters is de 
beauvoirs undying love and respect for sartre she addresses him 
as my dear little being and she loves everything about him 
from his little arm and little lip to his little 
roundneck pullover sweaters and little face 
when im with you nothing seems so terrible as leaving you 
yet faraway the least little fear is unbearable i love you 
passionately im empty and unhappy without you i love you 
with something tragic and with complete abandonment she wrote 
le bon de beauvoir justified publishing the letters she said 
the whole truth regardless of how shocking or unsettling is 
better than myths and part truths 
isnt it preferable to say everything in order to reveal the 
truth and avoid by the force of first person narrative all the 
cliches myths lies and allow the real person in all its 
entirety to emerge le bon de beauvoir wrote in the preface 
readers may be surprised to learn how little de beauvoir worried 
about or even thought about world war ii she was too busy rushing 
from one left bank cafe to another meeting friends and lovers 
analyzing their relationships and writing it all in letters to 
sartre all in the name of honesty 
from a distance this was a grand task alphant concluded 
up close it looks more like a hamster running on a wheel

the rev thomas j mcanoy wept when he saw what 
vandals did to his church 
broken stained glass lay in puddled foam that had been sprayed 
about the sanctuary from a fire extinguisher banners were torn 
from their posts liturgical vestments splashed with wine and 
tossed in an alley 
that desecration last september and other troubles threatened 
the life of our lady of rosary church in downtown detroit but 
while many innercity roman catholic parishes here and elsehwere 
have closed the centuryold rosary is making it 
the battering from vandals occurred only three weeks before the 
church marked its 100th anniversary and while its continued 
existence was considered uncertain by the detroit archdiocese 
rosary was among 24 innercity churches whose futures were 
labeled questionable in the second stage of the largest catholic 
church retrenchment in us history thirty other parishes had been 
closed earlier during phase one in early 1989 
similar difficulties strained other urban parishes chicagos 
big debtburdened archdiocese said in january that 30 financially 
strapped parishes with declining congregations and at least six 
schools would be closed 
the possibility of that fate hung over rosary a red sandstone 
building that rises grandly above interstate 94 the vandalism 
worsened the anxieties parishoners feared the 8000 repair bill 
would be the final blow 
rosary already was struggling with other hardships the loss of 
an organist who moved away the pastors failing health mcanoy 
60 had recently lost his second leg to amputation because of poor 
circulation 
but when the verdict came in february on the archdioceses phase 
two only five more parishes were closed bringing the total in 
detroit to 35 in a year cardinal edmund szoka said rosary would 
stay open 
parishoners said the past year would be remembered as the year 
of the milestone not the tombstone 
i think we are more focused now said norbert kidd 
president of the parish council i think a lot of people sat down 
and said this church the people in it the family that gathers 
here we mean something to each other 
the closings of other parishes blamed on dwindling resources 
caused by three decades of catholics migrating to the suburbs 
brought angry protests from some parishioners 
it did serve as a heck of a motivator said jay berman 
spokesman for the archdiocese it woke a lot of people up where 
things were in the doldrums 
in 1989 rosary with its selfassigned mission of reaching out 
to mentally and physically disabled people in the neighborhood 
increased its membership from 477 to about 560 kidd said he 
expects the number to grow to 600 
rosary also nearly tripled its weekly collection bringing it 
into compliance with the archdioceses directive that 50000 of 
the churchs 100000 annual budget come from donations kidd said 
he told parishioners 961 had to be collected each week 
since july there have been only two weekends we fell below 
that he said it used to be if we broke 300 we were 
congratulating ourselves 
some of rosarys new members came from st theresas a church 
about 10 miles from rosary that was closed under szokas order 
one transplant idell lee of detroit said the transition was 
difficult because st theresas was home and there was no other 
place to turn 
lee said on her first visit she looked inside our lady of the 
rosary which has neither pews nor elaborate paintings on the 
walls and thought this is it 
then one of the blind parishioners tugged at her dress and asked 
her if she would bring him a cup of coffee i knew then i was in 
the right place lee said 
the church which is about 60 percent white 25 percent black 
and 15 percent asian also proved its viability by certifying its 
speakers and eucharistic ministers through the archdiocese 
it also increased evangelical services and received an 
acceptable though critical report from two people who paid an 
unannounced visit on behalf of the archdiocese 
their report recommended the church use more approved texts 
train lay ministers on the meaning of liturgical symbols and 
gestures and reevaluate the practice of allowing parishioners to 
dip communion hosts into the wine which is supposed to be sipped 
overall kidd thought the report was fair 
its like they wanted us to hear the lecture and once we heard 
the lecture it was ok just so that we knew what should be he 
said

a study monitoring television preachers 
finds that on the average they devote about a fourth of their time 
to fundraising and promotion 
but major shifts in that area have occurred in some tv 
ministries 
the study made by stephen winzenburg communications professor 
at grand view college found that both pat robertson and oral 
roberts had sharply increased time used seeking support 
roberts now uses 53 percent of his air time in fundraising and 
promotion compared to 22 percent in 1987 while robertson spends 
44 percent of his programs asking financial help up from 22 
percent three years ago the report said 
however the rev jerry falwell has reduced fundraising appeals 
in that period from 52 percent to 37 percent it said

courseullessurmer france ap eight days after allied 
soldiers stormed ashore in normandy the destroyer la combattante 
carried gen charles de gaulle across the choppy gray english 
channel to a beach at courseullessurmer 
or was it next door at grayesurmer 
fortysix years later the communities still argue over whose 
sand bore the imprint june 14 1944 of the generals first 
footprint of the liberation 
the dispute has regained the stature of controversy in this 
special year of de gaulle the 100th anniversary of his birth the 
20th anniversary of his death and the 50th anniversary of his 
appeal of june 18 from london in 1940 urging the french to 
resist the german occupation 
a veterans group the normandy landing committee decided to 
commemorate the year by erecting a 60foothigh metal cross of 
lorraine de gaulle took the doublebarred cross as his personal 
symbol and it remains the symbol of gaullism 
for what the committee members called aesthetic reasons 
they decided to install the cross on grayes beach which enraged 
the folks at the courseulles city hall 
de gaulles own war memoirs are not much help 
on the morning of june 14 we cast anchor as near as possible 
to the french coast and landed together with a canadian regiment on 
the beach between the communities of courseulles and 
saintemereeglise he wrote courseulles and saintemereeglise 
are about 45 miles apart 
canadian soldiers liberated courseullessurmer and 
grayesurmer on dday june 6 1944 at one time or another de 
gaulle told officials of both towns he had fond memories of landing 
on their beach after four years in london 
im sure de gaulle himself did not know exactly where he set 
foot said remy simon a councilman assigned by courseulles mayor 
jeanlouis de mourgues to gather documents and build the case for 
their town which has about 3000 inhabitants 
in the end all this business is very painful said mayor 
michel grimaux of graye whose population is about 600 he hinted 
that courseulles interest was commercial as much as historic 
adding to the problem is the fact that no one in either town saw 
the general arrive for security reasons only military commanders 
were told in advance 
later on june 14 after giving a speech at bayeux de gaulle 
returned to courseulles and reboarded the destroyer there is no 
shortage of photographs of his departure from courseulles 
in 1946 de gaulle came back and he came back to 
courseulles said simon who has a footthick file of documents 
on the matter all of the eyewitnesses of the time confirm it was 
courseulles 
the courseulles documentation includes letters from several 
people who accompanied de gaulle including adm andre patou who 
was a captain at the time and skipper of la combattante and gen 
pierre koenig all say courseulles was the landing place 
we are fighting for the historical truth and thats all 
simon said he denied any other motives 
courseulles is a tourist town that grows to between 18000 and 
20000 people in summer and during school holidays it has a 
marvelous beach hotels swimming pools tennis stables and a 
chateau as well as a thriving oyster business and boatbuilding 
graye rich in charm has remained a sleepy country village 
mayor grimaux a boy of 12 at the time said his certainty that 
de gaulle landed in graye came from lt col wj humphrey a 
briton who was beachmaster on the grayecourseulles sector of the 
juno beach landing area 
according to grimaux humphrey said all vips to the newly 
liberated sectors of normandy including winston churchill and king 
george vi landed directly in front of the beachmasters 
headquarters which was clearly in graye it also was humphrey who 
provided de gaulle with a jeep the mayor said 
grimaux has clippings from the local newspaper in 1946 quoting 
de gaulle as telling a previous graye mayor i will never forget 
your community it is there that i landed 
la presse de calvados added editorially a decisive word that 
puts an end to certain controversies 
when a site was chosen for the lorraine cross the town boundary 
of courseulles was moved 65 yards west so the monument straddles it 
simon the courseulles councilman found that a grotesque 
solution but said we gave in to a compromise to be reasonable 
not because its right 
grimaux said all that interests me is the truth

the wreck of the exxon valdez forced more 
scrutiny and higher costs on alaskas oil industry and may have 
delayed for years the exploration for new oil in the states vast 
arctic wilderness 
in the six weeks from the tanker disaster to the legislatures 
mandated adjournment lawmakers raised industry taxes and spill 
fines strengthened plans for spill prevention and cleanup and set 
up an independent investigatory commission 
this year even as the reform momentum slows they are 
considering more spill bills including a package by gov steve 
cowper that would allow the state to inspect tankers and increase 
liability requirements for companies transporting or storing oil 
such enthusiasm for reining in alaskas largest and most 
lucrative industry would have been inconceivable before march 24 
1989 the day of the big spill 
alaska depends on oil like no other state deriving about 85 
percent of its revenues from oil taxes and royalties its 531000 
residents pay no state sales or income taxes yet the state leads 
the nation in percapita spending 
at the same time the thick flow of crude has helped the state 
amass a 105 billion savings account its earnings yield an annual 
dividend to every alaskan last years was 873 
for a decade we had seen nothing but the up side which was 
state revenues with no pain to the public said senate president 
tim kelly a republican what we saw from the exxon valdez was 
the down side of the oil business 
the oil stains and smears left on the treasured landscape of 
prince william sound angered alaskans who felt betrayed by their 
favored industry and by their legislators no one was spared the 
fingerpointing 
we got slapped around said house speaker sam cotten a 
democrat 
so did the industry 
it was almost the oil industry vs the state of alaska said 
bill webb general manager of the prooil alaska support industry 
alliance thats a dangerous position for a state to be in with 
its largest industry 
the emotion in which eight spill bills were swiftly passed last 
spring has dissipated but its an election year and environmental 
protection remains a priority legislators predict passage of three 
or four more oilrelated bills by may 
we were the legislature on watch when this thing happened 
cotten said so its really up to us to get it all done 
but some say much remains to be done 
sue libenson executive director of the alaska center for the 
environment said the states response has been overrated last 
years spill bills were stopgap measures that dealt only with 
the immediate disaster she said 
we didnt see anything that would really prevent future 
spills she said we have yet to create any new policies to give 
real longterm incentives to polluters not to pollute 
and lawmakers with more time to reflect no longer are rushing 
to vote against the oil industry 
the lynchmob mentality has left the legislature and cooler 
heads are starting to prevail said rep robin taylor house 
minority leader 
that is welcome news for jim palmer a spokesman for bp 
exploration alaska inc an arm of giant british petroleum 
last year if any piece of legislation had oil spill on it 
it was automatically assumed correct and needed without as much 
scrutiny as normally is given palmer said this year that has 
changed all different views on the thing are being heard 
including ours 
legislators also worry about the spills effect on oil 
exploration the disaster held up legislation in congress that 
would have opened the arctic national wildlife refuge for 
exploration 
the huge fields at nearby prudhoe bay supply about 25 percent of 
the nations domestic oil but production is declining the best 
hope to maintain production and keep revenues flowing may be the 
wildlife refuge known to alaskans by its acronym anwr 
support for opening the refuge to exploration remains strong in 
alaska despite the exxon valdez spill 
the majority of the legislature and the majority of alaskans 
continue to support the safe and orderly development of anwr 
said kelly the senate president on the national level the 
spill probably held it back a year or two 
alaskas sole congressman republican don young is optimistic 
congress eventually will act on the refuge 
the nation needs anwr opened because were importing over 50 
percent of our oil a position that is much more precarious than 
during the 1973 oil embargo when the united states imported 36 
percent of its oil young said 
but the wreck of the exxon valdez gave environmentalists a new 
weapon against opening the refuge 
its made everyone sit up and say gee is it really worth 
the risk are the oil industrys assurances that everything will be 
fine something that we can rely on said mike wenig attorney 
for the environmental group trustees of alaska 
as the spill has focused attention on alaskas oil dependence 
the state has continued efforts to diversify its economy exports 
of seafood timber and minerals were up sharply last year and 
anchorage got a boost when federal express chose the city as its 
international cargo hub 
but economic diversification will be tough to achieve in this 
remote state 
were just not close enough to the marketplaces to compete in 
software high technology or something of that nature kelly 
said so with the exception of tourism in the foreseeable 
decades we are going to be a resourcedevelopment state 
and the most profitable resource in alaska remains oil 
nobody wants to get out of the oil business in alaska kelly 
said its just too lucrative

when a roman catholic bishop banned a 
candidate for the california senate from receiving communion 
because she supports legal abortions the voters delivered her an 
upset victory 
and when new york gov mario cuomo was threatened with the fires 
of hell he shrugged off a bishops attempt to change his stand on 
abortion 
despite such failures religious leaders particularly roman 
catholics have increased their efforts to influence politicians 
on abortion according to abortionrights activists 
the pressure tactics have touched off a debate in political and 
theological circles about the role of the church in modern politics 
it is a revival of the controversy john f kennedy had to quiet 
before winning the presidency 30 years ago and that presidential 
nominee al smith faced as a catholic before him 
the prelates seem to imply that al smith and john kennedy were 
wrong in contending that catholics in politics are as free as 
communicants of other faiths historian arthur schlesinger jr 
wrote in the new york times if they had spoken then as they 
speak now john f kennedy would never have been elected 
president 
the antiabortion pressure from religious leaders is not coming 
solely from catholics 
a state representative in new hampshire republican stephanie 
micklon was barred from membership in the charismatic american 
baptist church that she grew up in after she sponsored a bill to 
put a womans right to an abortion into state law 
micklon was told she was not religiously acceptable to her 
church and that she brought disgrace upon the name of jesus 
christ she said 
this is religious blackmail she said if i had changed my 
vote i was religiously acceptable 
the salvation of cuomo a catholic and potential 1992 democratic 
presidential candidate was called into question when auxiliary 
bishop austin vaughan in january said the governor takes a very 
serious risk of going straight to hell for supporting abortion 
rights 
cuomo gives roman catholic bishops credit for helping foster 
national debate on abortion but he says they can expect a backlash 
when they attempt to influence elections 
i dont think we can exempt them from the demands of prudence 
in the political arena he wrote in a letter to the catholic lay 
journal commonweal magazine this month 
some other political analysts agree 
when the church gets too heavyhanded they have problems 
said charles cook author of a washingtonbased political 
newsletter they can work quietly and its effective but when 
they go too far its going to hurt them 
a state senate race in california last fall is cited as one 
example 
democrat lucy killea running in a special election was barred 
from taking communion because of her support for abortion rights 
her subsequent victory was widely credited to the attention and 
sympathy generated by the ban imposed by bishop leo maher of san 
diego 
catholics for free choice a private group that supports 
abortion rights said it knows of cases where catholic public 
officeholders or candidates have been pressured by church leaders 
over the abortion issue in at least eight states frances kissling 
president of the group cited cases in montana connecticut 
pennsylvania alaska washington new york new jersey and 
california 
she said killea is the only known case where a catholic 
politician has been denied communion because of abortion views but 
others she said have felt more subtle threats 
theyre afraid afraid theyre going to get up one morning 
and be refused communion afraid theyre going to be embarrassed by 
church officials she said 
the efforts have not not changed minds on the issue kissling 
contends but have caused some officials to shrink from leadership 
roles such as sponsoring legislation 
although kissling worries about a chilling effect some 
political leaders say they see no evidence that church activity is 
hurting the abortionrights cause 
it can be a powerful tool but i think its backfiring said 
kate michelman head of the national abortion rights action league 
theres a great sensitivity in this country to separation of 
church and state 
the national right to life committee the leading antiabortion 
lobbying group works with church groups but distances itself from 
the actions of religious leaders 
we just dont really get involved in religious issues said 
spokeswoman nancy myers 
the complaints about religious meddling in the politics of 
abortion come as catholic leaders appear to be asserting themselves 
more on public policy issues said the rev richard neuhaus a 
lutheran who is director of the institute on religion and public 
life in new york 
i think there is a new consensus among the bishops that there 
is a new level of agreement and urgency in making the churchs 
teachings credible with public officeholders he said 
catholic bishops approved a resolution last november that put a 
priority on lobbying against abortion rights it urged public 
officials especially catholics to advance these goals in 
recognition of their moral responsibility 
cardinal john oconnor chairman of the bishops committee for 
prolife activities wrote each member of congress this month to 
state opposition to a bill that would write the supreme courts 
abortion guarantees into federal law he sent each congressman a 
picture of an 18weekold fetus to illustrate the insanity of our 
nations current policy sanctioning abortion on demand 
kissling sees evidence catholic leaders are pursuing an 
overall strategy to pressure officeholders that goes beyond mere 
lobbying an activity she does not question 
but bob wonderly a spokesman for the us catholic conference 
the public policy and lobbying arm of the church said there was no 
agreement to sanction churchgoers whose public actions are at odds 
with the church on abortion 
each bishop is doing what he feels is necessary to fulfill his 
ministry wonderly said

a year after the alaska oil spill some 
experts still point to exxon corps reaction as a virtual primer 
on how not to handle a disaster 
to be nice id say they did not distinguish themselves 
said gerald meyers former chairman and chief executive officer of 
american motors and author of a book on corporate crisis control 
when it hits the fan 
to be more blunt they screwed up he said for whatever 
reason the company appeared to be indifferent or uncaring or 
unconcerned while hundreds of sea otters and all kinds of wildlife 
were washing up on shore 
marilou hedlund managing director of the hill amp knowlton public 
relations firm in chicago said several new clients came to her 
saying in essence we dont want to have what happened to exxon 
happen to us 
reporters had trouble getting comment from exxon about the march 
24 spill and company chairman lawrence g rawls stayed away from 
the area and didnt appear before reporters until april 18 
within hours of the spill a local group volunteered to mobilize 
fishing boats to help move in equipment to keep the oil from 
spreading but in another example of what critics label exxons 
clumsiness the company never returned their call the groups 
members said by the time exxon responded with its own equipment a 
storm had moved through the area and spread the oil over a wider 
region 
the associated press called exxon asking to discuss its handling 
of spills but officials at the corporations new york 
headquarters its subsidiarys headquarters in houston and its 
bayway refinery in linden nj all declined comment 
ms hedlund and other crisis managers a burgeoning subfield of 
public relations live by a simple maxim theres no substitute for 
practice 
we do crisis training with our clients actually create an 
incredible crisis and simulated news and radio reports and see how 
they handle them she said 
ms hedlund said she also refers clients to several textbook 
examples of good crisis management including united airlines 
handling of the crash of flight 232 in iowa last summer and johnson 
amp johnsons of the nightmarish tylenol poisonings of the early 
1980s 
the key to the success of both cases was the companys 
immediate release of everything they knew and their handling of 
victims families she said 
meyers said british petroleums recent oil spill off huntington 
beach calif provides another good example 
they learned from exxon no doubt he said bps chairman 
jim ross flew there almost immediately and showed a takecharge 
attitude that was a very bad scene an oil spill right in the 
cradle of the environmental movement but they weathered the 
storm 
exxon recently halted oil loading and unloading operations at 
its only east coast refinery after three spills in two months in 
new york cityarea waters even though only one of the spills was 
directly tied to exxon property 
the shutdown illustrates exxons tension over its public image 
in the year since its tanker split open in alaskas prince william 
sound said simon trimble international oils analyst for the 
investment firm shearson lehman hutton in new york 
these days trimble said it doesnt take 10 million barrels 
of oil spilled into american waters for there to be a negative 
impact on exxon

a disappointing christmas shopping season 
resulted in a 39 million secondquarter loss for rh macy amp co 
inc increasing the financial pressures on the debtburdened 
retailing chain 
macy which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986 said 
tuesday the markdowns it was forced to take to compete with price 
cutting at campeau corps department stores took a heavy toll on 
its balance sheet 
the loss which translated to 2767 per share compared with 
the 726 million or 3985 per share macy earned in the same 
period a year earlier 
sales during the quarter ended jan 27 totaled 244 billion up 
from 228 billion a year earlier 
pamela stubing a retail industry analyst with moodys investors 
service inc said many of macys stores in the northeast had stiff 
competition from campeaus federated department stores and allied 
stores units macy choosing to defend market share rather than 
profit margins cut prices to keep its customers she said 
federated and allied which were on the brink of a chapter 11 
bankruptcy court filing slashed their prices during the holiday 
season to bring in cash 
the loss could not have come at a worse time macys second 
quarter the fourth quarter for most other major retailers is 
when the company hopes to earn half its annual profits 
the company also is dependent on its cash flow to pay down the 
remaining debt from its leveraged buyout macys earnings statement 
reported nearly 454 billion in longterm debt as of jan 27 and 
189 million in interest charges during the second quarter 
walter loeb a retail consultant and analyst said macy also was 
hurt by overstocking its private label merchandise to reduce 
inventory the company again was forced to cut its prices he said 
but the company succeeded in cushioning the shock about the 
dismal quarter having signaled to investors and its suppliers some 
time ago that it expected to report a sharp loss loeb said 
loeb said macys will continue to have problems in the near 
term but he said there were signs the retailer would fare better 
during the spring because of warmer weather and because the company 
is going into the season with a leaner inventory 
in a letter to its investors dated monday macy said it was 
prepared for the economy to remain flat during the spring and fall 
seasons indicating the retailer does not expect a burst of 
consumer spending 
ms stubing predicted the retail environment would be less 
promotional meaning fewer markdowns to draw customers during 
macys second half although the company still faces tough 
competition 
for the first six months of its fiscal year macy lost 722 
million or the equivalent of 5158 per share compared to 
earnings of 536 million or 2475 per share in the same period 
a year ago 
sales for the first half rose to 415 billion from 39 billion 
loeb said the financial and retail industries have confidence in 
macy chairman edward finkelstein who shaped the companys buyout 
and its retailing strategy 
besides its flagship macy stores located mainly in the east and 
texas the company owns i magnin and bullocks stores in 
california and the west it also owns specialty stores including 
charter club and aeropostale which are stocked with macys private 
label apparel brands

exports of us paper products rose 91 percent 
last year to a new record while paper imports declined for the 
first time in seven years the american paper institute inc 
reported 
the industry exported 172 million metric tons of paper 
products which were worth 154 billion the value of the exports 
rose 154 percent from the previous year 
api vice president irene meister who released the report 
tuesday at an annual industry conference here noted that the 
industrys strong performance resulted from years of productivity 
gains and the high level of capital investment in new capacity 
exports of newsprint and printingwriting paper posted the 
biggest categorical gains jumping 46 percent and 66 percent 
respectively the institute noted however that the gains came on 
the heels of a relatively low year 
imports of paper goods declined slightly to 166 million metric 
tons valued at 115 billion after rising every year since 
1982 wood pulp and newsprint mainly from canada accounted for 70 
percent of the imports 
newsprint consumption in the united states held relatively 
steady at 123 million tons in 1989 according to virgin horton 
vice president of the apis paper group 
us paper mills shipped 552 million tons of newsprint up 
100000 tons from the previous year 
horton noted that demand for newsprint is dependent upon 
newspaper advertising linage and circulation which should hold 
steady in coming years 
circulation has been flat over the past decade he said adding 
that consumers generaly do not alter their newspaper reading habits 
during a recession and the amount of advertising dollars allocated 
to newspapers has also held relatively steady in recent years 
the us paper industry is celebrating its 300th year the api 
is sponsoring the 113th annual paper week this week at the

if the baseball lockout never ends what will 
the sports media write and talk about this summer 
some media companies already are juggling their plans even as 
they hope they will never have to answer that question 
the lockout has blocked the opening of spring training camps for 
nearly a month and it already has cost the espn cable network five 
of the 10 spring training games it planned to televise this year 
potential problems loom for cbs which is to begin broadcasting 
baseball in april the national the new daily sports newspaper 
and the sporting news the sports weekly 
it hasnt affected us yet but baseball is the only game in 
town in the summertime said tom osenton president and chief 
executive of the sporting news publishing co in st louis if 
you take the game away you have nothing to write about 
espn is in the first season of its 400 million contract to 
carry up to 175 games in each of the next four years 
getting that contract was such an exciting moment for us 
said mike soltys manager of programming information for espn to 
start out in this manner is certainly discouraging 
the network filled the gaps created by the lost games with live 
tennis auto racing and other programming it had originally planned 
to tape for later replay he said 
plans are to substitute a college basketball playoff game a 
college baseball game and college wrestling among other events if 
the remaining spring training games are canceled soltys said 
he said the network is sticking with its plans to run a baseball 
show baseball tonight seven nights a week starting as scheduled 
next monday 
if the lockout continues the show will deal with developments 
in negotiations between the players and owners and may feature 
coverage of minor league baseball he said 
but espn faces a more serious problem in april when it planned 
to begin carrying six games a week the network has hired 19 
commentators to handle the nightly baseball show and the games 
soltys said and has sold more than 60 percent of its seasons 
advertising inventory in the games 
soltys said the advertisers are being given the options of 
appearing on the replacement programs holding off until the games 
start or getting refunds 
but he said the lockout has hurt the climate for selling 
advertising there is no way of knowing where we would be without 
this he said 
soltys said there are provisions for lost games under the 
network contract with baseball but he refused to describe them a 
source familiar with the contract said espn and cbs will be given 
additional games in the next three years for games lost this year 
the lockout has posed a less serious problem so far for cbs 
which agreed to pay 106 billion for the right to broadcast 16 
regular season games the allstar game the playoffs and world 
series every year for four years 
cbs first baseball broadcasts are scheduled for april 14 and 
april 21 but its third broadcast is not scheduled until june 16 
cbs sports spokesman tony fox said the network has not decided 
what sports programs will replace the april game broadcasts 
fox said more than half of cbs advertising inventory for 
baseball had been sold but he declined to discuss what plans were 
being made for advertisers if games are canceled 
the network plans to run its baseball season preview show on 
march 31 as scheduled no matter what happens with the lockout fox 
said 
as at the sporting news the lockout has had little impact so 
far on the national according to editorinchief frank deford the 
newspaper debuted jan 31 in new york chicago and los angeles 
deford said readers of the national usually are interested in 
several sports and there has been plenty of activity recently in 
college and professional basketball boxing and hockey to interest 
them 
but if the baseball lockout continues into midsummer that 
would be a real blow to us there is no question 
at the sporting news osenton said plans are being made to beef 
up basketball and hockey coverage over the next few weeks and said 
if the lockout persists the tabloid may increase coverage of minor 
league baseball 
deford said it was unlikely the national would start covering 
minor league or japanese baseball because he doent think readers 
want it you cant give people something they dont want he 
said 
he said if the lockout continued into june there probably would 
be more coverage of major tennis soccer golf and swimming events 
he said the paper also could be trimmed to 32 pages from the 4048 
pages it has been running 
deford professes to be unconcerned and has made no contingency 
plans my best judgment is i cannot conceive of a situation where 
they will not be back by june he said

a bill giving the securities and exchange 
commission authority to curb program trading in stock market 
emergencies has moved a step closer to law despite objections from 
the treasury department 
the securities markets stabilization act was approved 
unanimously on a voice vote tuesday by the house energy and 
commerce committee 
the bill would allow the sec to limit program trading and other 
activities during periods of extraordinary market volatility 
but the scope of that power was narrowed in an amendment to the 
bill which now goes to the full house for approval 
the treasury department made public a letter from undersecretary 
robert r glauber to the committee opposing a program trading 
restriction stating the department believed the reform bill was 
too important to be jeopardized by a controversial and 
unnecessary provision to shut down program trading 
meanwhile a member of the panel said he plans to introduce 
legislation with a member of the house agriculture committee to 
unify jurisdiction for hybrid financial instruments under one 
agency 
the sec which regulates securities and the commodity futures 
trading commission which oversees the futures markets have been 
waging a turf battle over new financial products tha fall in the 
middle 
often called hybrids they have characteristics of both 
securities and futures a federal appeals court ruled last year 
that securities with any aspect of a futures contract should come 
under the cftcs jurisdiction prompting the sec and the exchanges 
it regulates to seek reform 
rep dennis e eckart dohio said he and rep dan glickman 
dkan would introduce comprehensive institutional reform 
between the sec and the cftc to give jursdiction for all these 
hybrid instruments to one agency 
glickman said said he didnt want to give the jurisdiction to 
either the sec or cftc but sought to establish a new federal 
regulatory body to oversee futures options securities and related 
instruments 
he said the proposed legislation was still in the formative 
stages and a long way from being introduced 
until we see something of a concrete nature we really cant 
comment it would be premature said cftc spokesman david gary 
he added we continue to support the concept of exclusive 
jurisdiction 
the proposed bill with the program trading reforms was an 
outgrowth of the 1987 stock market crash it also would require 
securities firms to keep and supply information to federal 
regulators about the financial health of their parent holding 
companies 
a similar market reform bill but without a program trading 
provision is pending before the senate 
the program trading amendment would limit sec control powers to 
activities previously determined to cause or contribute to 
extraordinary volatility that is sharp rises and drops in stock 
prices such a determination would be made through the secs often 
time consuming rulemaking procedure of public hearings comment 
letter and staff review 
the change satisfied rep norman lent rny whose objections 
to antiprogram trading language in a previous version of the bill 
prevented its quick approval by the full committee last fall 
at that time he and other members of the telecommunications and 
finance subcommittee argued that language introduced by rep 
edward j markey dmass the subcommittee chairman was vague and 
ambiguous 
originally markey wanted to limit activity that was 
disruptive abusive or manipulative 
markey said the new language was worked out after three months 
of negotiations among committee democrats and republicans the sec 
and the securities industry 
i cant say im thrilled with the version we have before us 
but its a long way from the original version said lent 
the bill also empowers the sec to obtain information and monitor 
large securities transactions and to halt trading with the 
presidents assent during market emergencies

care famous for donating food digging canals 
and building hospitals in the third world has devised a new form 
of aid for the 1990s debt relief investment banking and venture 
capital 
the new yorkbased nonprofit organization has formed a 
subsidiary aimed at assisting heavily indebted developing countries 
devise innovative ways to reduce dependence on foreign loans 
cares small business assistance corp also can help foreign 
lenders recover some of the money they have sunk into latin america 
and other black holes of debt over the years subsidiary president 
donald nicholson said 
the subsidiary invests in small and mediumsized businesses 
from fruit canners in honduras to shrimp farmers in the 
philippines when invited by the host country it also is exploring 
business ventures in other countries undergoing profound political 
change including poland and nicaragua 
philanthropy and finance experts said the care subsidiary is the 
first investment banking venture formed by an international relief 
group to help developing countries become more selfreliant 
still with total third world foreign debt of 12 trillion 
cares effort is expected to have only a symbolic impact at first 
ive never heard of a relief group doing this said an 
official at the world bank in washington who asked not to be 
quoted by name but weve always said that anything helps any 
sensible approach with the interests of all parties at hand 
building small bridges is welcomed 
the care subsidiary will hold a minority stake in companies it 
invests in and will concentrate on businesses worth 250000 to 
25 million foreign banks and other creditors that contribute to 
the subsidiarys investment fund will receive dividends if the 
businesses are profitable 
were not going to solve the problems of heavily indebted 
third world countries nicholson said but we bring a unique 
approach to the third world crisis because were not for profit 
nicholson said he has talked with citibank chase manhattan bank 
and bankers trust about restructuring part of their third world 
debt through the care subsidiary 
he said cares clean reputation and cultural sensitivity in 
foreign countries give it advantages that larger forprofit 
companies might never obtain 
we are identifying existing viable businesses in the 
developing world and investing in them especially those that can 
earn hard currency through exports he said profits realized 
from this will be used to fund care development projects around the 
world 
the care venture coincides with economic shifts making it more 
difficult for developing countries to get aid from their 
industralized counterparts putting increased pressure on 
philanthropies and volunteer groups to fill the breach 
many large western banks for example burned by billions of 
dollars in bad loans to latin america are toughening terms for 
extending more credit the united states historically a leading 
source of aid to the developing world is becoming more stingy 
because of its large federal deficit 
a number of banks have sought to reduce third world debt 
exposure by converting some debt into local currency to be invested 
domestically others have tinkered with ways of repackaging or 
swapping debt for other types of securities such as the stock of a 
company based in a debtor country 
what care has done has in effect set up its own specific 
mechanism to carry out these type of transactions said peter j 
davies president and chief executive officer of interaction a new 
yorkbased coalition of 120 private voluntary relief organizations 
james mcdermott a banking analyst at the new york investment 
firm keefe bruyette amp woods said most major banks already have 
taken steps to protect themselves from third world loans but he 
said they are always looking at other ways to reduce the risk 
the whole process is chipping away at exposure he said 
this care subsidiary seems to be part of that process 
nicholson a 51yearold american raised in peru long has been 
active in third world investment banking he founded axion group a 
venture capital firm that invests in developing countries 
care the acronym for the cooperative for american relief 
everywhere inc is is one of the biggest international aid groups 
formed at the end of world war ii to send emergency supplies to 
refugees 
its 7200 employees and thousands of volunteers worldwide now 
distribute more than 300 million worth of aid annually

a group of powerful investors including the 
owners of mary kay cosmetics and a getty family trust has come 
through on its promise to launch a proxy battle seeking four seats 
on the board of avon products inc 
in a fullpage advertisement in todays editions of the new york 
times chartwell associates lp said its directors if elected 
would work to maximize shareholder value by selling avon to a 
buyer who can develop the companys true potential 
the group noted it may propose merging with avon itself 
chartwell said it currently holds 99 percent of the companys 
outstanding stock making it one of avons largest shareholders 
the proxy battle does not come as a surprise chartwell outlined 
its plans for a contest in a filing last month with the securities 
and exchange commission at the time chartwell controlled 91 
percent of avons stock 
partners in chartwell associates include the fisher real estate 
family of new york as well as the family trust of oil heir gordon 
p getty and a subsidiary of dallasbased mary kay corp the 
parent of mary kay cosmetics 
avon chairman james e preston had met chartwell representatives 
last month and told the group new yorkbased avon is not for sale 
in its ad chartwell said it will seek four seats on avons 
11member board 
in criticizing avon management chartwell noted that the 
companys stock price declined 39 percent from a high of 56 a 
share in 1979 to 34 at the end of last week earnings per share 
fluctuated from 417 in 1979 to 210 last year the group said 
in addition chartwell complained that avon spent more than 12 
billion to expand into heathcare and specialty chemical businesses 
but then was forced to dispose of some of those businesses after 
losing more than 1 billion 
we believe that avons current board and management simply do 
not understand their core directselling business and its enormous 
potential and will not be able to deliver the performance they have 
promised chartwell said in the ad 
preston recently told securities analysts that avon expects 
profits to improve substantially this year on a modest increase 
in sales 
preston had emphasized in his meeting with chartwell that avons 
sales representatives wouldnt welcome any link to mary kay 
whatsoever he said mary kay had become the enemy to avon 
representatives chartwell has maintained that it would not propose 
combining avon and mary kay 
chartwell said in its sec filing that in no event will 
mary kay or mary kay cosmetics inc merge with the company nor will 
the sales forces of the company and mkci be integrated or combined 
with each other in any manner whatsoever 
last year avon earned 546 million after a deficit of 4045 
million in 1988 when it had 5456 million in losses from 
discontinued operations among other avon shareholders with 
significant holdings are minneapolis investor irwin jacobs and 
texas financier robert bass

greyhound lines inc agreed to resume talks with 
the union representing its bus drivers for the first time since the 
violencemarred walkout began nearly two weeks ago 
the dallasbased company said tuesday it had agreed to begin the 
talks saturday in phoenix at the request of bernard delury head of 
the federal mediation and conciliation service 
the companys announcement seemed to catch union officials off 
guard 
if this is true we welcome the opportunity to talk to the 
company this is what we have been seeking all along said james 
la sala international president of the amalgamated transit union 
at least seven shooting incidents have been reported since the 
strike began march 2 including one in florida where eight people 
were injured a picketing driver was crushed to death by a bus on 
the second day of the strike 
on tuesday a sniper shot at a moving greyhound bus in chicago 
in fresno calif a greyhoundowned trailways bus parked in a 
storage yard was set on fire monday night police said no one was 
injured in either episode 
greyhound had refused to resume negotiations unless the union 
offered new proposals spokesman george gravley had said tuesday he 
did not know if the union had changed its offer 
theres no point in our speculating what may happen gravley 
said we are going back to the bargaining table and that speaks 
for itself 
greyhound the only nationwide bus company has been operating 
on a reduced schedule to the 9600 communities it serves using 
permanent replacements and union members willing to cross the 
picket line 
greyhound has said it cannot afford more than the 63 million 
threeyear pact it offered the company valued the unions last 
offer at 207 million although the union said it would cost much 
less 
the differences apparently stem from questions over the cost of 
measures such as benefits safety pay incentives and productivity 
raises 
in the shooting at 115 am two bullets hit the front end of 
the bus one hit the door and one went through a window and just 
missed a fellows head by a couple inches said master sgt john 
meduga of the illinois state police 
everybody started to scream meduga said 
gravley said he had no evidence to connect the latest shooting 
to the strike but added we dont have buses shot at when were 
not negotiating a contract 
union officials have condemned the violence which has included 
three shootings in chicago and shootings in ohio arizona florida 
and connecticut 
greyhound spokeswoman liz hale said a 25000 reward remained in 
effect for information on a sniper who shot a bus sunday in 
jacksonville fla injuring eight passengers with shrapnel and 
other debris 
in pittsburgh meanwhile the city council issued a resolution 
encouraging residents to boycott greyhound buses until the strike 
is over the council accused greyhound of an utter lack of good 
faith toward its employees

an actor playing a heart attack victim tells the 
tv camera that fleischmanns corn oil margarine commercial does 
your heart good you wont be seeing him any more 
the attorneys general of 10 states including new york 
complained that the ad doesnt do consumers good its confusing 
they said 
nabisco brands agreed tuesday not to revive that ad as well as 
commercials that tout the health benefits and nutrition of shredded 
wheat and 100 percent bran cereal 
new york attorney general robert abrams said nabisco 
advertisements misled consumers to believe that its fleischmanns 
margarine could by itself reduce cholesterol and prevent heart 
disease 
he said nabisco also misrepresented the fiber content of 
shredded wheat and implied that 100 percent bran is sweetened 
exclusively with natural fruit juices 
the corporation agreed to shelve the commercials but admitted 
nothing 
hank sandbach a spokesman for nabisco said consumer reports 
said shredded wheat had plenty of fiber and our advertising said 
that a leading magazine called the cereal high in fiber 
as for 100 percent bran sandbach said the nabisco advertising 
claim that the product was sweetened with two natural fruit 
juices in no way implied the absence of other sweeteners 
nabisco signed the agreement with the 10 states and agreed to 
pay 135000 in legal costs 
under the agreement nabisco promised 
not to broadcast television commercials for fleischmanns corn 
oil margarine that use the phrase head start to a healthier 
heart and does your heart good 
not to state or imply that the products will cure mitigate 
treat prevent or reduce the risk of heart disease or cause a 
reduction in cholesterol 
not to advertise that a leading consumer magazine has 
concluded that shredded wheat is high in fiber 
not to advertise 100 percent bran as flavored with two 
naturally sweet fruit juices unless or until such sweeteners are 
used exclusively 
the agreement also was signed by the attorneys general of 
california florida illinois iowa massachusetts minnesota 
missouri texas and wisconsin 
hank sandbach a spokesman for the new yorkbased company said 
that under the agreement nabisco did not admit to any wrongdoing 
he also said the advertisements on television and on box tops 
had not been used for nearly a year 
they were retired for market reasons he said theyd done 
their job and ran their course 
the nabisco agreement came a week after the federal food and 
drug administration announced plans for sweeping changes in 
foodlabeling laws that would require information on fat and 
cholesterol on many foods

a federal judge is taking a constitutional 
challenge of president bushs savings and loan bailout under 
consideration after acknowledging the tremendous impact of a ruling 
against the government 
olympic federal savings and loan association of berwyn ill 
asked us district judge royce c lamberth on tuesday to block any 
federal takeover of the weakly capitalized sampl 
its attorneys argued that the top federal sampl regulator is 
holding his position unconstitutionally and thus any move by him to 
seize olympic would be illegal 
government attorneys disputed the argument but said that in any 
case the public interest in seeing the sampl bailout progress 
overrides any points olympic might be able to win 
a ruling that no one in the office of thrift supervision has 
authority to act would be an invitation to chaos said aaron b 
kahn a lawyer for the agency 
he said a decision favoring olympic would open the floodgates to 
scores of similar suits the government has seized 393 failed sampls 
in the past year 131 of them since the aug 9 enactment of 
president bushs bailout bill which olympic is challenging 
lamberth after listening to more than two hours of oral 
arguments said he would rule by march 21 that is when his march 7 
temporary order blocking immediate seizure of olympic expires 
the judge did not indicate which way he was leaning but he said 
the public interest issue was the most difficult in the case which 
if decided as olympic urged would have a tremendous impact 
former justice department attorney charles j cooper 
representing olympic said he recognized the farreaching 
implications but added its not as wildly devastating as the 
government would have you think 
he argued that the constitution protects the rights of 
individual citizens or in this case a savings institution even at 
the expense of taxpayers and the public in general 
in any case the added expense of delaying the seizure of 
olympic when compared with the overall cost of the sampl bailout 
takes something which is a raging inferno and tosses a cigarette 
into it cooper said 
olympic is disputing the constitutional authority of acting 
thrift office director salvatore r martoche as well as the 
director he replaced m danny wall 
the new sampl law provided that wall who was chairman of the old 
federal home loan bank board would inherit the directorship of the 
thrift office without being reappointed by the president and 
reconfirmed by the senate 
however cooper said walls appointment in effect died because 
the agency he headed was abolished he said martoches temporary 
appointment after wall quit earlier this month would have been 
valid had wall been properly appointed 
but in this case martoche is filling a new position a situation

a consortium of three japanese companies plan to 
invest about 825 million in the development of boeing cos 
proposed 777 jet according to a published report 
the nationally circulated newspaper asahi shimbun reported 
tuesday that the three companies led by mitsubishi heavy 
industries ltd will inform seattlebased boeing by the end of the 
month of their intention to participate in the project 
the newspaper identified the two other companies as kawasaki 
heavy industries ltd and fuji heavy industries ltd 
officials of the companies were not immediately available 
wednesday to comment on the report 
asahi said boeing had asked the three japanese firms to 
undertake 25 percent of the estimated 33 billion development cost 
of the project or about 825 million 
the boeing project calls for development of a new jet with a 
300 to 350passenger capacity 
the japanese firms plan to ask the japanese government for 
financial assistance if they participate in the project asahi said 
japans government already has spent about 46 million since 
1986 in a development project involving the three companies and 
boeing of a separate jet the b7j7 which would have a capacity of 
150 passengers asahi said 
the costs and risks of development of new airliners have become 
so great that single companies can rarely undertake such projects 
alone

the central bank also announced the cruzado the national 
currency would be devalued 107 percent effective monday when 
banks reopen 
by tuesday evening lines stretched for blocks at automatic bank 
machines in major cities with people trying to get cash for the 
next several days withdrawals were limited to the equivalent of 
47 per person per day

almost 30 years has promised freemarket economic reforms to try 
to bring down a 2700 percent inflation rate he takes office 
thursday and plans to announce his emergency economic plan to 
congress the next day 
the threeday bank holiday was decreed by zelia cardoso de 
mello the nations new economic minister 
the bank holiday was declared to preserve the stability of 
markets until the whole package of measures is announced she 
said in the past few days there has been a great deal of 
speculative activity and we wanted to calm the market down 
ms cardoso de mello no relation to the presidentelect 
offered no further information about the new economic proposals 
which are expected to include selling off inefficient state 
companies firing thousands of public employees and making huge 
spending cuts 
newspaper reports in all major dailies said today the economic 
measures were expected to include 
a wage and price index which would increase by a set amount 
each month perhaps preceded by a brief wageandprice freeze 
an increase in utility and fuel rates this was expected to 
include a 30 percent jump in electricity prices and a 70 percent 
increase for fuel

brazils government is operating with a 31 billion deficit and 
has a 114 billion foreign debt the worlds largest 
business leaders have expressed concern about a possible 
wageandprice freeze the basis of four failed antiinflationary 
plans by the outgoing administration of jose sarney both the 
presidentelect and ms cardoso de mello have denied they will 
implement a freeze 
the devaluation was much larger than normal officials have 
devalued the cruzado about 2 percent daily to keep up with 
inflation 
brazil with about 150 million people has been wracked for 
years by persistently high inflation that has outpaced wage 
increases an active labor movement has struck frequently for 
higher salaries and benefits 
of brazils 60millionmember work force the leftist central 
workers union and the more moderate general workers center claim to 
represent close to 35 million workers

the first meeting between leaders of the pilots 
union at trans world airlines inc and the companys new chief 
operating officer collapsed tuesday because of a dispute about the 
confidentiality of their discussions 
kent scott chairman of the twa branch of the air line pilots 
association said chief operating officer william hoar unexpectedly 
demanded that the unions executive council keep all remarks secret 
from the rank and file 
we simply couldnt live with that kind of a gag order scott 
said 
although scott offered to keep some information confidential 
hoar and two twa officials who accompanied him decided to leave the 
unions headquarters in st louis and fly back to new york twa has 
corporate offices in mt kisco ny 
scott said he was puzzled by the turn of events and added that 
he did not know what hoar might have been planning to tell the 
union leaders if they granted his request 
he agreed to this six weeks ago and then five minutes before 
the meeting he wanted to change the ground rules scott said 
hoar said monday that he planned to appeal to the pilots for 
concessions and to outline specific measures that managers were 
taking to strengthen twa 
union leaders invited hoar to come to st louis and discuss the 
outlook for twa when he was appointed chief operating officer in 
january 
hoars actions tuesday should not damage relations between the 
pilots union and twa scott said but they could delay a 
presentation to the executive council until june 
on monday the 12 members of the executive council elected scott 
to a twoyear term as chairman 
he had been acting chairman since late august when his 
predecessor tom ashwood was recalled 
the council members who voted to oust ashwood were concerned 
that his deteriorating relationship with twa owner carl icahn had 
undermined his ability to negotiate with the company 
but scott also has taken a relatively hard line in his dealings 
with icahn criticizing the investors management of twa and his 
call for further concessions from workers 
scott said monday that the 80 million in concessions that icahn 
is seeking from the pilots would do little to resolve twas 
problems 
twas financial woes in no way relate to the pilots wages and 
working conditions he said they are instead the predictable 
result of icahns 1988 privatization transaction which crippled 
the company with more than 26 billion in debt much of it through 
junk borrowing and simultaneously extracted more than 650 
million in cash from the airline 
scott has maintained that icahn intends to dismantle twa and is 
trying to make it appear as though the pilots are forcing him to 
sell assets by refusing to accept concessions

and paper business along product lines in a move that will include 
some layoffs and expects to sell some assets this year 
surely there will be some reductions in force ad correll 
executive vice president of georgiapacifics pulp and paper unit

rep dan rostenkowski called on the american 
public today to voice support for his plan to slash the budget 
deficit by raising taxes and cutting federal spending 
what the american people have to do is show their reaction to 
their representatives the chairman of the taxwriting house ways 
and means committee said on nbctvs today show 
theres a timidity on capitol hill that is somewhat 
frightening he said you worry about the next election but i 
dont think you should be committed to it to the point where youre 
going to lose the national interest 
rostenkowski dill read one telegram he received that said 
im 83 years old i dont care if youre an old dog you have 
courage go for it youre doing the right thing 
the bush administration has shown interest in negotiating about 
rostenkowskis plan but democratic leaders have shown only 
lukewarm support for it 
bush asked today about conflicting signals the white house has 
sent on the rostenkowski plan told reporters read all the tea 
leaves listen to the nuances its out there very clearly he 
made the comment after touring a power plant in aquasco md 
house speaker thomas s foley says white house interest in 
rostenkowskis proposal is meaningless unless president bush joins 
with the lawmaker and supports a tax increase 
the president is the key and indispensable participant in any 
effort to reduce the deficit and that includes taxes foley 
dwash said tuesday unless bush renounces his notax pledge 
chairman rostenkowskis proposal cannot be enacted he said 
rostenkowski dill on sunday proposed to eliminate federal 
deficits by raising federal income and excise taxes freezing 
domestic programs for one year including social security benefits 
and cutting defense spending 
we face big problems that cant be solved with nickelanddime 
solutions rostenkowski said tuesday nothing less than our 
childrens future standards of living are at stake 
bush meantime continued his administrations positive reaction 
to rostenkowskis proposal he called it a bold initiative with 
evident good will and determination to try to break the ice and 
move the process forward 
but the president also reiterated his opposition to raising 
taxes and steered clear of endorsing any specific element of the 
proposal 
white house budget director richard darman speaking at a news 
briefing emphasized the seriousness with which the administration 
was taking the plan and even hinted there might be new fees beyond 
those already in the presidents budget which bush might not 
consider tax hikes 
the comments by administration officials made clear they would 
much prefer to negotiate on the budget with rostenkowski than with 
other more partisan congressional democrats 
but foley said he intended to proceed with the normal budget 
process in the house 
a great deal of the white house response had to do with 
friendship between mr rostenkowski and the president that doesnt 
speak of any substantive change on the part of the president to 
consider new taxes foley said 
other democratic leaders echoed foleys sentiments toward bush 
no one came forward to endorse the deficit plan except as a serious 
proposal 
congressional republicans meantime took advantage of the 
administration ability to keep the rostenkowski plan in the news by 
issuing statements attacking democrats on its politically toughest 
points 
i see this as simply affirmation of the basic democratic 
agenda raise taxes continue the growth of democratic programs and 
if necessary cut social security to do it said sen phil gramm

its the year of the horse but the 
turtle might be a more fitting symbol for chinas economy as it 
enters the 1990s with millions of factories shutting down and 
workers idled 
boomtown china with its ubiquitous construction cranes and 
conspicuous consumption has given way to a cashstarved economy 
pushed to the brink of recession by a government determined to curb 
inflation 
inflation is falling retail prices were up about 7 percent by 
yearend about a third of the official inflation rate for the 
previous two years 
but the process of curbing it has brought new problems equally 
troubling the government which showed through its violent 
suppression of a prodemocracy movement nearly a year ago that it 
values stability above all 
unemployment and indebtedness have grown sharply and 
productivity has fallen the 1980s entrepreneurial spirit has 
subsided replaced by renewed emphasis on central planning and 
political correctness 
the government began its attack on inflation in late 1988 by 
ordering sharp cuts in construction official spending and loans 
but the full impact hit in the last quarter of 1989 when 
industrial output grew at an annual rate of less than 1 percent 
vs nearly 21 percent for all of 1988 
in a series of emergency moves the government loaned state 
companies nearly 27 billion at the end of the year and ordered 
factories to recall laidoff workers even if they had nothing to do 
this month premier li peng hinted at an early end to the 
retrenchment which was to have lasted three years when he called 
for development to be brought back to a reasonable pace more 
significant economic shifts may be disclosed at the upcoming 
national peoples congress session 
they were running into a recession but they pulled up at the 
last minute said a western economic analyst speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
she said local governments also cushioned the shock by loaning 
money to the worsthit companies and helping others merge or 
restructure 
there seems to be a lot of flexibility in the system to create 
safety nets she said 
but others believe restarting the engine will not be that easy 
before people were on a roll they were willing to say lets 
do it it took 10 years for people to forget that making 
decisions could be risky said a western diplomat now theyve 
been reminded and everyone wants to wait for the central 
governments sayso 
so far the economic slowdown is less apparent in the shops 
which remain full than in the warehouses 
televisions refrigerators electric fans bicycles rugs and 
dozens of other products in high demand a year ago are piling up in 
storehouses as consumers heed the governments call to spend less 
and save more 
the result has been to idle millions of workers making the 
nolongerpopular items in january china made 40 percent fewer 
color tvs than in january 1989 and about half as many cars washing 
machines and refrigerators state statistics show 
government officials say privately that unemployment among urban 
workers is 4 percent and growing but the figure would be much 
higher if it includd the millions who spend their days doing 
unproductive work cleaning workshops studying political 
documents playing cards 
rural authorities have organized tree planting and water 
conservancy projects to occupy the millions of peasants sent home 
from city construction teams or laid off from tiny rural factories 
that were the first casualties of the austerity 
workers with jobs also have felt pinched wages have failed to 
pace even the reduced inflation 
the foreign employment service corp in shanghai which supplies 
personnel for foreign employers stopped paying wages for months a 
shoe factory in shanghai paid its workers in shoes which they 
tried to hawk on the main shopping street 
angry workers have sought permission to demonstrate in several 
cities chinese sources say and unconfirmed reports describe 
actual marches in the northeast chinas heavyindustry heartland 
authorities deny the reports 
they acknowledge however that many factories are in trouble 
nationwide companies owe each other a total of 21 billion because 
cashpoor banks wont release funds 
yao fugen president of the shanghai no 1 sewing machine 
factory doesnt ship any machines now unless hes paid first 
denied credit by banks he also borrowed more than 3 million from 
customers swapped sewing machines for pig iron and began 
testmanufacturing fishing rods as a hedge against the soft sewing 
machine market 
the government says manufacturers who show ingenuity will 
survive and inefficient ones will fail ultimately benefiting the 
economy 
in practice the survivors are stateowned factories notorious 
for inefficiency while millions of private collective and other 
nonstate factories have closed banks refuse them loans and they 
find it harder than ever to get raw materials because the 
government has recentralized distribution 
authorities are trying to improve productivity at the state 
factories by stepping up marxist education among the workers and 
reviving the past art of elevating labor heros 
but at three large state factories in shanghai the industrial 
heart of china communist party secretaries said marxist study was 
mainly limited to party members 
western analysts agree that action was needed to cool inflation 
but they worry the government will hit the pump again without 
correcting any basic problems such as irrational prices and taxes 
a western diplomat predicted they may go through all this 
pain with nothing to show for it

a faltering economy and resurgence of 
anticapitalist sentiment are adding to chinas already formidible 
reputation as a difficult place to invest 
the government is wooing foreign investment and technology as 
fervently as ever and most analysts agree that china needs and 
wants western help to modernize 
but its efforts to curb inflation and shortages of key raw 
materials have reversed freemarket reforms of recent years once 
again miring foreign businessmen in socialist red tape 
moreover the conservative backlash to last years mass protests 
for democratic reform has revived official suspicion and resentment 
of foreigners 
theres a faction that believes the foreigners have been 
getting too good a deal and should be controlled said a western 
lawyer resident in shanghai speaking on condition of anonymity 
another lawyer said chinese bureaucrats told him they could not 
process foreign business quickly because theyre afraid of being 
seen as zhao ziyangs running dogs zhao was ousted in june as 
communist party chief blamed for excessive liberalism that helped 
spawn the democracy movement 
authorities sent one foreign company a letter admonishing it not 
to look for profit in china every penny you make as a foreign 
investor the chinese look at as a penny out of their pocket 
said a western diplomat 
several major american companies say they are thinking of 
pulling out were not here on a welfare basis said one 
american manager who did not want his company named before a 
decision is made 
he said efforts to mend problems with the chinese partner 
reminded him of a child trying to keep his parents together when 
maybe its the best thing for them to divorce 
another joint ventures foreign board members voted to dissolve 
the venture but the chinese side refused a small us familyowned 
company simply walked away in frustration from its china joint 
venture not bothering to formally dissolve ties 
new investment contracts have been signed since june when the 
army attack on student protesters in beijing chilled 
chineseforeign relations but they are down sharply from the 
prejune pace 
one problem is that government signals are confusing the 
national peoples congress chinas legislature is expected to 
amend the joint venture law to pledge not to nationalize them and 
to let foreigners to serve as chairmen 
businessmen call these positive moves but an even more welcome 
proposal to extend the 50year limit on the life of joint 
ventures faces stiff opposition and is not expected to pass 
the government also has tightened controls on joint venture 
prices imports and exports and purchases of domestic supplies 
treating them in the words of one foreign expert more and more as 
if they were stateowned companies 
shanghai volkswagen was still waiting in early march for beijing 
to decide its 1990 production quota and prices before last year 
it needed only shanghai city approval to change prices 
the new controls are not just from the center of power shanghai 
approved new regulations last year giving the communist 
partycontrolled unions the right to join in joint ventures 
longterm planning sessions and to intervene whenever a worker is 
disciplined or fired 
foreign businesses also have been hurt by last years dramatic 
slowdown in chinese economic growth accompanied by a dramatic cut 
in bank loans and severe shortage of cash for even normal 
transactions 
our accounts receivable have gone right out the window said 
the american manager of a shanghai joint venture weve sent 
teams out collecting i know of a company that sends two people to 
sit in debtors offices and tells them not to leave until they are 
paid 
some joint ventures have borrowed from foreign parent companies 
or from union funds or have mortgaged assets in what amounts to a 
handtomouth existence 
but local authorities equally desperate for funds have hit on 
the joint ventures like piggy banks 
seacliff limited for example a usjapanese partner in a new 
luxury hotel and office complex in shanghai has been told that for 
every car it imports for the hotel it will have to donate two cars 
to local authorities the centers general manager michael kalyk 
said the issue is under negotiation

every year 20yearold sun lili travels 
three days by bus and train to a factory near canton to buy cartons 
of brightly colored hair trinkets and plastic jewelry 
she hauls them back to wenzhou a port city midway up the 
chinese coast and resells them from her own private stall 
not many women her age in china have that much spunk but not 
many young women earn 10000 yuan or more than 2100 a year either 
about five times the average workers wage 
in wenzhou however sun is far from extraordinary private 
business is the citys lifeblood and has been for generations to 
hear residents talk 
since the song dynasty wenzhou has had a commodity economy 
said ma jinlong referring to the 10th century rulers of china ma 
is deputy director of the city systems restructuring commission 
another oddity not many cities as small and remote as wenzhou 
have thinktanks to encourage private and other nonstate 
enterprise 
as a result while private factories account for less than 5 
percent of the nationwide industrial output in wenzhou they 
produce more than 32 percent most of the shops and restaurants are 
private and tens of thousands of wenzhou residents hit the road 
each year as traveling salesmen 
wenzhou 250 miles south of shanghai seems to lack the 
requirements of a commercial center it has no airport although 
one is nearing completion and no rail link 
visitors endure a 24hour ferry ride from shanghai or 10hour 
drive from hangzhou to the northwest 
youve heard of capitalist tails asked a visiting 
shanghai woman that was what the radical leftists during the 
196676 cultural revolution called anything that smacked of 
capitalism well wenzhou was a capitalist tail 
during the mid1980s the city briefly became the tail that 
wagged the dog as top officials and delegates from around china 
visited to observe the wenzhou model for prosperity 
encouraging householdbased small businesses 
thenpremier and later communist party secretary zhao ziyang a 
leading proponent of market reforms visited in 1985 but zhao was 
ousted last june accused of embracing dangerous liberalism 
his successor as party chief jiang zemin has made a point of 
visiting major state factories and revolutionary war bases 
with the dual aim of curbing inflation and reviving marxist 
spirit the central government has cut off loans and supplies to 
nonstate enterprises it also has ordered deep cuts in spending 
and construction pushing the national economy almost into 
recession 
wenzhou again is under a shadow authorities have begun policing 
its private businessmen more closely for tax evasion and smuggling 
and some have been arrested or forced to close 
late last year a wenzhou man who ran a private credit union was 
executed he apparently misused funds to build and furnish his 
home but official reports of the case broadly criticized all 
private credit unions as speculative undertakings meant for 
reaping windfall profits 
yang jiaxing chairman of wenzhous lucheng city credit 
cooperative gets a frustrated look when he talks about profits 
his credit union founded in 1986 as chinas first private 
banking operation earned 13 million yuan or about 276000 last 
year but after taxes it had 15300 left to distribute among 
shareholders 
we originally thought wed make more yang said but the 
number and size of taxes keep growing three more were added last 
year

faint murmurs rise from the floor a 
voice intones now start trading 
figures flash on an electronic board us dollars are selling 
for 591 yuan the previous days closing price and 12 yuan over 
the official exchange rate 
sellers are hawking 54 million and buyers want 53 million a 
bank trims its sales offer and the figures match the price stays 
unchanged 
it took two minutes within an hour all the transactions have 
been processed and the clients have left the shanghai currency 
exchange 
market employees relax with a noisy game of pingpong on a table 
in front of the big board housed in an imposing former bank from 
the precommunist days when shanghai was an asian financial center 
our market is elementary one could even say primitive said 
qiu jirong a young worker at the shanghai foreign exchange 
transaction center 
nonetheless it is the most sophisticated tool china has for 
matching up chinese and foreign companies that need dollars with 
those that have dollars and need the local currency renminbi a 
yuan is the basic unit of renminbi 
the renminbi like most socialist countries currencies is not 
convertible on world markets and chinese banks hoard hard 
currencies because they are needed to buy foreign goods before 
china opened its first currency exchange markets in 1986 most 
foreign companies that earned renminbi on investments had no way to 
repatriate their profits 
shanghais market is a model of what chinese leaders hope to do 
generally as they reform the economy borrow western tools but keep 
socialist principles of central control the center uses price as a 
balancing tool but has little else in common with western 
financial markets 
playing the market for profit is not allowed prices are set in 
isolation from world markets and even from markets in other cities 
in china 
still its come a long way since 1986 then businessmen had to 
find their own partners to buy or sell currency the center was 
just a place to register the deal and prices varied widely 
the currency exchange markets in other cities still stick to 
this model but in 1988 shanghai advanced to a more systematic and 
auctionlike way of trading four mornings a week banks and 
companies that are registered as members bring their buy and sell 
orders to the center 
the center tallies them up when dollar supply exceeds demand 
it lowers the price of a dollar by one fen onehundreth of a yuan 
every two minutes until some sellers withdraw or buyers enter 
when demand for dollars exceeds supply the price is raised the 
price is fixed when buy and sell offers balance and all trades are 
made at the same price 
now its more fair said the centers deputy manager wang 
deshun a thin talkative man who once worked for chinas central 
bank information is open and everyone can watch the movement of 
prices and decide whether to enter the market or not 
thats the theory in practice the government tightly controls 
who can trade and for what purposes new regulations such as a 
ban on importing luxury cars directly affect dollar demand and 
therefore the exchange rate 
the center also can reject traders if the gap between supply and 
demand is too large or the central bank can step in and make up 
the difference wang said it has done so about 10 times 
historically dollars have gone from a high of 78 renminbi in 
september 1988 when import spending was freer to a low of 498 
reached last november when the governments tight loan policy 
forced many companies to sell dollar reserves 
we have to consider the interests of buyers and sellers 
wang said if the price for dollars goes too high many 
companies wont be able to buy dollars they need and if it falls 
too sharply thensellers wont be able to pay their debts 
because the center invariably devalues the renminbi from the 
official exchange rate economists say it at least achieves a rate 
closer to the real buying power of the two currencies for years 
china has kept its renminbi artificially high 
but some foreign businessmen say all the controls just make the 
center rate a second official rate set to serve the interests of 
state trade companies they are the main dollar sellers and benefit 
from the centers high dollar price while foreign joint ventures 
buy dollars to repatriate profits or import parts 
it dilutes our profits all we want is for them to let us 
exchange our renminbi at the official rate said the disgruntled 
american manager of one joint venture factory who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
like some other joint ventures he tried another way of getting 
dollars by buying a chinese product to sell abroad he made his 
purchase and lined up a hong kong buyer then the buyer disappeared 
now he has several tons of frozen chinese jelly fish sitting in 
a warehouse hes back to the currency market

volkswagens joint venture autoworks in 
shanghai produced nearly 16000 cars last year the equivalent of 
four days output for the headquarters factory in west germany 
still volkswagen has big plans for the shanghai factory if 
china will just release the brakes and put it in gear 
when volkswagen ag signed a 5050 joint venture contract with 
the shanghai tractor and automobile corp in 1984 it seemed a 
perfect fit 
volkswagen wanted a manufacturing base to win a share of the 
chinese and southeast asian auto market china spending tens of 
millions of dollars annually to import japanese cars wanted to 
modernize its auto industry 
shanghai volkswagen started with a capacity of about 100 cars 
per day or 30000 a year then doubled capacity last year but the 
most china has ever let it produce in one year is the 15687 cars 
that rolled off the line in 1989 
the problem is politics while chinese auto officials were 
approving volkswagens expansion and devising plans for three more 
joint venture autoworks over the next decade top communist leaders 
decided cars were a luxury 
last summer they banned practically all new car purchases 
domestic and imported alike by government units and stateowned 
companies the slogan hard work and plain living was promoted 
to curb inflation blamed on ousted communist party leader zhao 
ziyang 
thousands of car orders were scrapped stocks grew shanghai 
volkswagen finally halted production for 39 days when its 
distributor complained it had nowhere to put more cars the french 
automaker peugeots joint venture in canton shut for two months 
auto industry careens toward a dead end read a headline in 
the official china daily at years end 
the crisis eased when the government intervened and bought the 
excess inventory 7440 cars from five chinese or joint venture 
factories at a total cost of 269 million wang rongjun 
volkswagens managing director said he believes most of the cars 
are still in government warehouses 
by early march beijing still had not told shanghai volkswagen 
its production quota for 1990 or responded to a request for a price 
increase to offset last years devaluation that makes imported 
parts more expensive the top west german manager burkhard 
welkener said he expects the quota will be 17000 
wang said beijing has quietly relaxed its ban on car purchases 
to allow replacement of old cars but purchases still must be 
approved by local authorities a long and difficult process 
moreover the government markup in taxes and other fees is 126 
percent discouraging many potential buyers 
fees inclusive the shanghai plants manual transmission santana 
a model that once sold in the united states as the quantum goes 
for 179700 yuan or roughly 38230 some provinces add more fees 
so the price exceeds 42550 
welkener said percar production costs could be cut 30 percent 
to 40 percent if the factory were allowed to produce at full 
capacity as it is the shanghai santana is too expensive to export 
competitively to southeast asia 
but welkener a tall mildmannered man seems philosophical 
about the government controls 
of course it is a little bit frustrating to produce only 
17000 he said but our company follows the idea of chinese 
officials that there has to be a readjustment we totally agree 
that everything has to be slower 
he said the factory still plans to send young chinese engineers 
to west germany for technical training and bring them back to 
design a new santana for export 
santana for me is not just a car santana is a philosophy to 
bring china modern management he said he used one of the few 
chinese phrases he knows we must do it yibu yi bude step by 
step

traditional national advertisers 
founded in 1976 lbs has specialized in identifying target 
audiences helping develop programs that will appeal to them and 
selling advertising time 
among the syndicated tv shows in which it sells time are family 
feud and the real ghostbusters it also sells time in the 
syndicated radio show flashback that features music and interviews 
from the 1950s 1960s and 1970s 
this fall lbs will handle advertising sales for the syndicated 
tv show that the national broadcasting co and memories then and

a national research council panel today called 
for billions more in government spending on child care mandatory 
oneyear leaves for parents of newborns and a program to establish 
strict national standards for day carecenters 
every american child not only deserves quality care the 
future vitality of our nation depends on it said john l palmer 
chairman of the committee that produced the report who cares for 
americas children 
the report said that by the year 2000 about three out of every 
four american children will have mothers in the work force and that 
even now the majority of american parents entrust care of their 
young children to others 
palmer a professor at the maxwell school of citizenship and 
public affairs at syracuse university said the committee found 
substantial scientific evidence that good quality child care 
can have serious effects on the future life of every child and the 
influence that child has in society 
committee member barbara bowman of the erikson institute in 
chicago said there is no good research to reflect how many of the 
thousands of child care arrangements in this country meet the 
minimum standards of quality 
she said limited research showed that only about 20 percent of 
care arrangements meet the standards of good or better 
ms bowman said that more than half of all children of working 
parents are cared for in facilities that are unregulated and as a 
result national data on the specifics of quality child care are 
lacking 
the report spelled out a future in child care in which virtually 
a whole generation will be cared for by persons other than parents 
the report said that in 1988 more than 105 million children 
under age 6 had mothers in the labor force another 18 million 
between the ages 6 and 13 had working mothers it said 
within five years the study said about twothirds of all new 
workers will be women and 80 percent of them are expected to have 
children at some point during their careers 
forecasts suggest that by the year 2000 about 80 percent of 
schoolage children and 70 percent of preschool children will have 
mothers who are working or looking for work outside their homes it 
said 
the report said that by 1995 the amount spent annually for child 
care in the united states will reach 48 billion but to provide 
adequate care for all children under age 13 it said total 
costs for parents and the government could rise eventually to about 
126 billion 
child care expenses absorb an average of 23 percent of the 
income of poor families the report said it noted however that 
one study shows that for families earning under 5000 a year the 
child care expense can represent up to 50 percent of the income 
higher income families pay about 9 percent of their income for 
child care 
the quality of child care facilities varies from state to state 
community to community and is affected by the parents income 
level the panel said 
enforcement of day care quality ranges from none in some states 
that lack license requirements or state inspections to other 
states with mandatory standards that are strictly enforced it said 
child care center employees are almost universally poorly paid 
and worker turnover is very high it said 
the panel said studies show there is an important need for 
parents to establish strong relationships with their children in 
the early months of life as a result it said the federal 
government should mandate unpaid jobprotected leave for 
employed parents of infants up to one year of age 
among large companies about 47 percent provide some form of 
paid maternity leave but only 10 percent of the companies with 
fewer than 100 employees had such a policy the report said 
five states california hawaii new jersey new york and rhode 
island and puerto rico include wage and position protection in 
pregnancy disability leave programs in new jersey for example 
workers are entitled to 26 weeks leave and up to 200 a week in 
compensation 
other recommendations 
the federal government and the states should increase subsidies 
to lowincome families for quality child care programs the added 
costs either through taxincentives or grants the report said 
could be as high as 10 billion 
establish a uniform national standard for child care this 
could include minimum safety and health standards along with 
acceptable ranges for stafftochild ratios group size caregiver 
qualifications and physical space in the facility 
expand head start and other preschool programs for children of 
poor families 
strengthen the infrastructure of the child care system by 
improving wages and training for caregivers expanding voucher 
programs to give poor families more opportunities to choose 
centers and encouraging organization of family day care systems 
the national research council is an organization of the national 
academy of sciences a private society of scholars chartered by 
congress with a mandate to advise the federal government on 
scientific and technical matters

the european parliament voted 
wednesday for a total ban on tobacco advertising throughout the 12 
nation european community 
but the ban will not take effect because the european 
communitys executive commission refused to accept the parliaments 
addition of the ban to proposed legislation to regulate tobacco 
advertising 
the parliament had added the tobacco advertising ban as an 
amendment to legislation proposed by the executive commission that 
would allow advertisers to show only the tobacco package and 
nicotine and tar yields in ads 
under ec law parliamentary amendments must be approved by the 
commission before they can be adopted on a majority vote by the ec 
governments if the commission fails to approve the amendments 
they can only be adopted on a unanimous vote by the ec governments 
a unanimous vote to ban tobacco advertising is highly unlikely 
because at least two members west germany and britain oppose such 
a ban 
however vasso papandreou the ec commissioner for social 
affairs said she would introduce new proposals after 1992 to ban 
tobacco advertising 
the current proposal should go into force at the end of 1991 
under the legislation proposed by the commission every tobacco 
advertisement would be required to carry a health warning covering 
at least 10 percent of the advertising space and more if the 
warning were in more than one language 
in addition tobacco advertisements in magazines aimed at those 
under 18 years old would be prohibited and indirect advertising 
such as putting tobacco brands or symbols on nontobacco products 
would also be banned

british airways plc has introduced a fourth class 
for airline passengers 
a british airways spokeswoman said wednesday the initial 
response to economy select available on flights between london and 
dallas or houston has been very positive 
economy select for passengers paying the full economy fare has 
a separate cabin separate checkin advance seat reservations and 
seats that recline 3 inches more than those in regular economy 
class the airline said 
the eightmonth trial program began feb 1 after extensive 
research said the spokeswoman who declined to be identified by 
name in accordance with british custom british airways is the 
first airline to introduce a fourth class she added 
today companies send their executives on full economy fares 
which cost more than promotional fares but which have the full 
flexibility they need for business said liam strong british 
airways marketing director 
the expectations of passengers who pay 794 pounds 1290 for 
a round trip ticket to dallas will obviously differ from those 
of leisure passengers traveling on these routes for as little as 
299 pounds 484 round trip strong said 
british airways business class fare between london and dallas 
or houston is 2122 pounds round trip or 3435 
stephen clapham an airline industry analyst at brokerage hoare 
govett said it remains to be seen if the new fourth class will be 
a success 
if they british airways were sure of a big demand they would 
have introduced it across the board he said 
pan am spokesman steve heckscher said the fourth class 
experiment bears watching 
maybe there is a niche that everybody else has missed but im 
a little skeptical that it really has a place in the range of 
tickets available today he said 
most companies will let you fly with a business class ticket 
so theres no reason to buy an economy ticket business seats are 
more comfortable theres a little more status and theres added 
flexibility with cancellations and rebooking heckscher said 
continental airlines spokesman steve preston did not rule out 
the possibility of a fourth class for that carrier 
we are looking at totally restructuring our business class and 
totally revamping our frontend products he said referring to 
first class and business class a number of things are under 
review at the moment 
an american airlines spokeswoman said the largest us carrier 
does not see an immediate need for a fourth class but added we 
are always looking to see what the industry is doing and if it 
seems the consumers are interested we might consider it 
british airways fourth class is limited to 31 nonsmoking seats 
between the business class and economy class sections on flights 
from gatwick airport outside london to dallas and houston

opec oil ministers will gather this 
week to discuss the world oil market but are unlikely to tamper 
with a formula that has brought them higherthanexpected prices 
there will be talks about the future but no decisions 
predicted pierre terzian editor of the parisbased newsletter 
petrostrategies 
peter gignoux director of the international energy department 
for shearson lehman hutton inc in london expects little from the 
meeting theyre going to come and go he said 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries monitoring 
committee will begin meeting friday in vienna talks are expected 
to center on the groups pricing strategy and current production 
levels although only eight oil members comprise the panel all 13 
opec ministers are expected to attend 
the discussions will be the first since the cartel met last 
november and set a crude oil production ceiling of 22 million 
barrels a day for the first six months of 1990 the previous 
ceiling was 205 million barrels for the final quarter of 1989 
analysts estimate that opec countries spurred by persistent 
cheaters kuwait and the united arab emirates have been producing 
at least a million barrels a day above their cap 
even so prices have remained above opecs benchmark of 18 a 
barrel reflecting strong demand by the united states and other 
consuming nations 
between november and february opecs basket of seven crudes has 
averaged more than 19 a barrel prices appear to have softened 
slightly in march but remain above the target price averaging 
1845 in the first week of the month 
west texas intermediate the benchmark american grade of sweet 
crude is currently priced in the 20 to 21 range down from 22 
to 23 in january 
analysts say prices could ease further in the second quarter 
when demand for oil declines with the onset of warm weather 
nick antill analyst at the londonbased county natwest 
forecasts demand for opec oil will run about 22 million barrels a 
day in the apriljune quarter below current production of 232 
million barrels estimated by the international energy agency 
nonetheless a flurry of reports in advance of the meeting 
suggests that the two main items likely to garner the most 
attention will be prices and quotas 
iraqs oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi was reported 
to be pressing privately for a higher target price but was unable 
to muster support from kuwait and saudi arabia for such a change 
kuwait with little support is said to be advocating a rise in 
the production ceiling to keep prices in check some analysts 
believe kuwait wants to keep prices at 18 to encourage sales and 
discourage nonopec countries attracted by higher prices from 
taking away some of the cartels market share 
kuwaits oil minister ali khalifa alsabah reportedly has said 
kuwait does not feel bound by its quota when prices remain above 
18 a barrel 
alsabah also was quoted in the middle east economic survey as 
calling for opec to abandon the quota system as soon as possible 
he is reported to have said the system is outdated and often 
ignored by members 
the cartel sets an overall production ceiling for its members 
and then slices the total into individual allotments for each 
producer 
with little pressure to change a formula that for now is 
working ministers are likely simply to air their views and leave 
decisions for the full conference of ministers in may 
opec secretarygeneral subroto has said no decisions are likely 
at this weeks meeting and that the discussions would provide 
important input for the may conference according to the 
organizations news agency opecna 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

microsoft corp a computer software developer 
has declared a 100 percent stock dividend that amounts to a 
oneforone stock split 
microsoft said tuesday the new stock would be issued to 
shareholders of record march 26 doubling the number of shares 
outstanding to about 112 million 
microsoft stock closed tuesday at 10625 down 2 in 
overthecounter trading 
raymond b ferguson microsofts director of administration 
said it was the second dividend the company has declared since it 
went public in march 1986 the first also a 100 percent stock 
dividend was issued in september 1987 
its not common to have a cash dividend in our industry 
ferguson said there is a greater requirement for cash to 
continue to grow the business 
microsoft president jon shirley said the dividend was declared 
to make the stock more attractive to a broader range of investors 
scott mcadams an analyst with ragan and mackenzie inc in 
seattle said making the stock more affordable also could boost the 
value of current stock holdings in the long run 
the market tends to like nominally priced stocks mcadams 
said 
when prices get too high he said theres a little bit of a 
psychological edge operating there that may keep the value of the 
stock down a little bit 
microsoft reported a profit of 74 million or 125 a share on 
revenue of 300 million for the three months ended dec 31 
compared with profit of 47 million or 85 cents a share on

entertainment colossus mca inc today bought 
the last big independent music label geffen records the home of 
such strong rock acts as guns n roses don henley cher aerosmith 
and whitesnake 
geffens sole owner david geffen will receive mca preferred 
stock worth about 550 million at todays share price he may sell 
it only over a fouryear period and thus will benefit if its price 
goes up and suffer if it falls 
he will stay on as chairman and chief executive of geffen which 
he founded a decade ago in a deal in which warner bros records 
distributed his recordings in return for half the profits that 
deal expires at the end of the year 
geffen had been negotiating with warner the british thornemi 
and other companies geffen records did about 225 million in 
business last year 
asked why geffen selected mca mca president sid sheinberg said 
i would suspect that the difference here is that hes dealing 
with people hes known for many years people with a broad basis in 
entertainment not just music 
sheinberg noted that geffen is known as a brilliant businessman 
im flattering myself but i think he also felt this was a 
very good security to own he said in a telephone interview 
in addition to geffens music business his geffen films has 
produced movies such as beetlejuice little shop of horrors 
and risky business geffen theatre coproduced m butterfly 
which earned nine 1988 tony awards cats dreamgirls and 
little shop of horrors 
mca is not buying those businesses but the universal citybased 
giant will acquire rights to geffens related music publishing 
business founded in 1987 as a vehicle for geffen recordsrelated 
projects it has since expanded and its stable of songwriters now 
includes stephen sondheim 
as part of the deal geffen signed a 20year standstill 
agreement that bars him from acquiring more mca stock or engaging 
in proxy wars 
west hollywoodbased geffen records artists also include tesla 
peter gabriel edie brickell and the new bohemians rickie lee 
jones pat metheny joni mitchell robbie robertson jimmy page 
olivia newtonjohn kitaro ric ocasek xtc christopher williams 
and kylie minogue 
mca unlike other major labels does not distribute its own 
records overseas its foreign distribution agreement with warner 
bros runs out in march 1991 and sheinberg said where we go 
from here in the foreign area remains to be determined 
he acknowledged however that mcas roster of country and black 
artists is far stronger than its list of rock acts 
having geffen certainly gives us a stronger package while 
negotiating he said 
geffens salary wasnt revealed the preferred stock he was 
issued is the equivalent of 10 million shares of mca common stock 
each share paid a dividend of 68 cents last year 
geffen who got his start as a talent agent was 27 in 1971 when 
he founded asylum records the home of joni mitchell the eagles 
and jackson browne within two years he sold asylum to warner 
communications becoming chairman of warners resulting 
elektraasylum label

the united states on wednesday unveiled a proposal 
to drastically reduce or eliminate import tariffs as its 
contribution to an ambitious international tradeliberalizing 
agreement planned for the end of the year 
us deputy trade representative rufus yerxa said the offer was 
contingent on the united states receiving corresponding concessions 
from its trading partners in the 96nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
in an 800page document to be submitted to gatt members on 
thursday the united states proposes the elimination of tariffs on 
imported agricultural products 
for a second group of goods including wood products and paper 
steel aluminum certain chemical products and selected 
construction equipment it proposes dutyfree access to us 
markets provided trading partners remove tariffs and all trade 
barriers from matching us exports 
for all other products the us proposal allows for tariff 
reductions up to a maximum of 50 percent again subject to 
reciprocal concessions by other countries after bilateral talks 
this third category includes the sensitive us textiles sector 
traditionally protected by high import tariffs 
yerxa told a press conference that cuts in textile duties were 
unlikely to reach the 50 percent ceiling although this was 
theoretically possible under the us plan 
textiles is a very tough category for us to make concessions 
on he said 
despite high import duties in sectors such as textiles clothing 
and footwear the united states has a low overall level of tariffs 
a tariff or tax levied on imported goods is one of the main ways 
of shielding domestic industry from foreign competition because it 
makes imported goods more expensive and therefore less competitive 
than domestic products 
yerxa said us import duty levels averages 66 percent for 
agricultural products and 5 percent for industrial goods in 
contrast to much higher protection in other countries 
in brazil for example tariffs average 47 percent of the value 
of traded goods according to figures listed in the us document 
in india the average is 99 percent and in pakistan 106 percent 
it would be a great travesty for the united states to have to 
reduce its already low tariffs if others dont make reductions 
yerxa said 
at a meeting in montreal in december 1988 trade ministers agreed 
on the overall target of 33 percent for tariff cuts 
a deal reached in january allowed gatt members to select their 
own method of achieving this target proposals have to be submitted 
by thursday 
gatt is a multilateral trade agreement first established in 1947 
and designed to establish rules reduce tariffs and provide a 
setting for a solution to international trade problems members of 
the marketorientated organization account for more than 
fourfifths of world trade 
the current uruguay round of trade talks is expected to end in 
december with an ambitious new agreement to liberalize trade in 
areas such as agriculture and textiles

central telegraph serves 120000 soviet telex subscribers and

securities through highpressure sales pitches and illegal means 
that violated securities laws

prudential insurance co of america said 
wednesday that its 1989 profit slipped 10 percent from a year 
earlier due largely to two major acquisitions that expanded its 
real estate and securities businesses 
meanwhile the head of its prudentialbache securities inc 
subsidiary disclosed there would be layoffs later this year in 
response to the sluggishness on wall street 
george ball prudentialbache chairman and chief executive 
officer did not specify the number of jobs that would be cut but 
said the firm wanted to avoid the bludgeon approach 
prudential said losses in its securities and residential real 
estate operations were largely to blame for a drop in 1989 earnings 
to 743 million from 829 million the previous year revenue 
however rose 15 percent to 4303 billion from 3750 billion 
prudential which is a mutual insurance company said income 
from operations before policyowner dividends and income taxes 
totaled 356 billion in 1989 down from 371 billion in 1988 
the company said it had solid earnings gains in its insurance 
and asset management businesses 
the losses in its securities and real estate businesses came 
mainly from prudentials acquisition last year of merrill lynch amp 
cos residential real estate operations and the branch offices of 
the wall street firm thomson mckinnon inc 
at its annual media briefing prudential chairman robert c 
winters called the approximatley 300 million real estate 
acquisition the most significant strategic development for the 
company last year prudential currently has more than 900 brokerage 
offices with nearly 25000 sales associates in 40 states 
winters said the thomson mckinnon acquisiton would position 
the firm to take full advantage of the potential we see down the 
road for the securities industry 
right now individual investors are staying away from the 
marketplace winters said we believe ultimately this period 
will end its a cyclical business 
several wall street firms including shearson lehman hutton 
inc have been contracting in recent months in part because of the 
slowdown since the 1987 stock market crash and a decline in mergers 
and acquisitions due to a sharp decline in the junk bond market 
ball who also spoke at the annual briefing said 
prudentialbache was evaluating where future staff cuts would be 
made the firm currently has around 19000 employees 
i do expect our head count to be lower he told reporters 
prudentialbache recorded a net loss of 51 million in 1989 
compared with a 111 million profit the previous year 
in its individual insurance sector prudential posted a 4 
percent increase in new business premiums to 34 billion life 
insurance sales slipped 15 percent to 806 million but annuity 
sales rose 23 percent to 21 billion it said 
new property and casualty insurance sales were up 23 percent to 
342 million but earnings were hurt by hurricane hugo and the san 
francisco earthquake it said 
the group insurance earnings also improved prudential said 
premium and fees from new sales of group life and health coverages 
were up 23 percent to 2 billion 
prudential said its institutional asset management group which 
manages a wide range of investments for pension funds and other 
large institutional investors had an 88 percent decline in sales 
to 78 billion
