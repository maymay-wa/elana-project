hu yaobang head of chinas communist party from 
1980 until he was ousted in disgrace in 1987 died saturday after 
suffering a heart attack he was 74 
the official xinhua news agency said hu suffered a heart attack 
on april 8 from which he never recovered the news agency said hu 
died of extensive cardiac infarction an obstruction of blood 
vessels at 753 am saturday 753 pm friday edt 
according to the south china morning post daily newspaper of 
hong kong hu suffered the heart attack during a meeting last 
saturday of the communist party politburo the partys top 
decisionmaking body 
hu although retaining his seat in the 17member politburo made 
few official appearances and had become a nearly forgotten figure 
in chinese politics after his dramatic ouster in january 1987 
hu survived 10 years of political purgatory to emerge as head of 
the 47million member communist party but then was purged again as 
he stood on the brink of becoming chinas most powerful man 
hu was one of chinas most outspoken critics of the leftist 
excesses of mao tsetungs 196676 cultural revolution that 
banished him to exile and became a leading pragmatist in 
encouraging a more marketoriented economy and greater private 
initiative 
it was his tendency to speak out in a nation where private 
opinions are discouraged and his tolerance toward critics of the 
socialist system that led to his ouster as party general secretary 
in 1987 at the height of the campaign against bourgeois 
liberalization 
despite charges that he had permitted westernization and 
procapitalist sentiments in china hu was a dedicated nationalist 
and party member he joined the communist guerrilla forces at age 
14 and never left a doubt that party ideals took precedence over 
everything including personal and press freedoms 
hu became head of the communist party in february 1980 and was 
allied closely to senior leader deng xiaoping whom he first met in 
1941 the longtime bridge partners shared the conviction that 
china in order to escape the grinding poverty of the past and grow 
economically must not repeat the political upheavals that marked 
the communists first quartercentury in power 
it was widely believed that hu was in line to take over some of 
dengs functions including head of the partys powerful central 
military commission when deng finally left the scene 
however hu had long alienated some conservatives with his blunt 
criticisms of maos policies and the military reportedly hedged its 
support for a man who had never held a senior military position 
in the end deng reportedly angered when hu on several 
occasions bypassed his orders or made decisions without consulting 
other party leaders is believed to have played a key role in 
engineering hus resignation 
hu in particular was blamed for allowing an atmosphere that 
resulted in widespread prodemocracy student demonstrations in 
december 1986 
hu was born in 1915 in liuyang county hunan province 72 miles 
from the birthplace of mao 
like deng and others who later rose to the top echelons of the 
party hu took part in the long march of 193435 he was a party 
official in sichuan province when the communists drove the 
nationalist government to taiwan and took over power in 1949 
in 1952 he became secretary of the communist youth league and 
four years later joined the partys central committee 
in 1966 as head of the youth league hu became a prime target 
of maos cultural revolution red guards shaved his head forced 
him to crawl on his hands and knees in an act of public humiliation 
and sent him to rural henan province for 2 years 
among his alleged sins the leftists charged hu and deng who 
was also banished to the countryside used railroad cars and 
special airplanes to ferry bridge partners around the country 
after henan hu underwent another two years being 
reeducated and five years under house arrest in 1975 he 
resurfaced as an official of the academy of sciences 
in 1977 hu became head of the partys organization department 
where he supervised the redress of frameups during the cultural 
revolution 
by 1980 hu was elected secretarygeneral of the party central 
committee and served as party chairman the post once held by mao 
until the title was abolished in 1982 
hu was 5foot 3inches slightly taller than deng and like 
deng a heavy smoker 
in 1983 he revealed he had four children and five grandchildren 
his wife was reported to be a retired textile factory manager

federal retirees have their eyes on 14 
billion in state income tax refunds after a us supreme court 
ruling that orders states to tax federal and state pensions equally 
or not at all 
the lawsuit filed by a michigan man who figures to save 800 a 
year on his state taxes could benefit more than 11 million 
retirees 
the state hit hardest is virginia where 200000 federal 
civilian and military retirees could be owed 150 million in 
refunds this year 
at least 20 others states could be affected according to an 
associated press survey that indicates the states could lose 461 
million a year in future revenue because of the ruling and could 
owe 14 billion if refunds for prior years are required 
about 1000 telephone calls have poured into the national 
association of retired federal employees following the march 28 
ruling said spokesman denis harrington 
theyre telling us we want our money back he said 
it was a bombshell we knew might happen and now has 
happened said oklahoma house speaker jim barker whose state 
could lose 22 million a year 
paul davis a former lawyer with the us securities and 
exchange commission who lives in east lansing said he filed the 
lawsuit in 1984 because michigan taxed part of his federal pension 
but not the pensions of state and local government retirees 
the court ruled that the retirees must be treated equally both 
taxed or both exempt and sent the case back to the michigan court 
of appeals 
i didnt anticipate the impact would be so large on states 
like virginia said davis who represented himself in the lawsuit 
states initially believed the cost would be small until they 
realized military as well as civilian pensions were involved said 
harley duncan executive director of the federation of tax 
administrators 
the word davis is the most commonly used word in state tax 
departments this week he said 
at least 21 states treat federal pensions differently from state 
and local ones according to ronald snell senior program director 
for fiscal affairs of the national conference of state legislatures 
in missouri senate appropriations chairman roger wilson said 
the 43 million annual loss and the possibility of owing 166 
million in refunds could mean a tax increase or deep cuts in the 
budget 
if youre looking for the devil with the shortest horns there 
aint one out there they are all extra long he said 
virginia gov gerald l baliles has called lawmakers back for a 
special legislative session on april 24 to deal with the issue 
which could cost the state 450 million if it is required to refund 
overpayments from prior years 
elsewhere west virginia amended its law to give federal 
retirees the same tax break as state and local retirees 
in montana a proposed measure would exempt all pension income 
from taxation oregon lawmakers created a special joint committee 
to find a solution and georgia is mulling the need for a special 
legislative session 
arizona gov rose mofford recommended taxing state and local 
retirement income on the same basis as federal 
some states including michigan and new mexico maintain that 
refunds arent required for prior years 
while states decide how to comply with the ruling the national 
association of retired federal employees is urging federal retirees 
to seek refunds for as many years as their states statute of 
limitation permits 
harrington said amended returns should be filed by this years 
state income tax filing deadline in order to preserve as many years 
as possible under the statute of limitations 
for the 1988 tax year he said retirees are being told to pay 
the tax and file an amended return 
states believed by the national conference of state legislatures 
to be affected are arizona arkansas georgia iowa kansas 
kentucky louisiana michigan mississippi missouri montana new 
mexico new york north carolina north dakota oklahoma oregon 
south carolina utah virginia and west virginia

a few days after michael dukakis lost the 
presidential election a london wax museum yanked a model of the 
defeated candidate from public view it was the shortest exhibition 
in the museums history 
at home gov dukakis is still on display most days at the 
statehouse but critics and even some supporters suggest he has 
become something of an invisible figure 
its been a long hard winter for dukakis he has announced a 
deficit in the state budget made himself a lame duck proposed 1 
billion in new spending asked taxpayers to cover the shortfall 
and taken a dive in public opinion polls 
he has also seen his wife kitty through a monthlong 
residential treatment program for alcoholism 
april is proving to be another cruel month massachusetts is 
facing a water shortage dukakis mother has been in the hospital 
and members of his own party are writing him off as irrelevant 
one legislative leader emerged from a budgetcrisis meeting in 
dukakis office last week and told reporters that taxes werent 
mentioned and neither was the lword when reporters asked 
which lword he had in mind the leader said loser 
through it all dukakis has chugged along in the slowbutsure 
style that marked his campaign leaving his shrinking circle of 
admirers to marvel at his steadiness and giving his critics more 
reason to believe as ted koppel said that he just doesnt get 
it 
after more than a quartercentury in public life dukakis 
himself takes a long view 
steady as she goes dukakis said when asked about the 
states multiple problems 
he seems to have the attitude that this too shall pass 
observed state rep nicholas paleologos a fellow greek and fellow 
democrat who was one of dukakis staunchest supporters 
hes clicked off of the presidential campaign and hes 
clicked back onto being governor he burns at about the same 
temperature no matter what he does paleologos said 
he really has become a nonentity at the statehouse 
commented barbara anderson the leader of citizens for limited 
taxation who shoveled antidukakis ammunition to the bush forces 
last year 
democratic state rep william galvin traced the governors slump 
to two events that followed dukakis acknowledgment in december 
that the state was 600 million short on a 12 billion budget 
galvin said dukakis lost public support with his 735 million 
tax plan and lost legislative support when he ruled out another run 
for governor in 1990 
a year ago not only was he governor he was a governor who 
might be president the boston democrat said adding that 
lameduck status diminishes any politicians authority whether 
theyre president or governor or sewer commissioner 
on the national scene dukakis nearly vanished as quickly as the 
london waxworks display which was on view for only 40 days 
two weekends ago when many prominent politicians were in 
washington for a mammoth prochoice rally dukakis was in new york 
city for a greek independence day parade and he barely made a 
ripple 
the democrats new national chairman ron brown was in boston 
recently and told a luncheon of politicians and contributors that 
the democrats are in great shape except for presidential politics 
as guests nodded brown said the problem in 1988 was a slowfooted 
campaign that lacked a message and let the republicans define the 
terms 
dukakis was sitting about 10 feet away 
statewide poll results in early february had the governors 
favorability rating down from his usual range in 70s to 435 
percent and his unfavorable rating at an alltime high of 527 
percent 
still the governors top aides and close friends insist that 
things will work out 
paul brountas the governors oldest friend who chaired the 
presidential campaign had lunch with dukakis recently 
i think hes in great shape brountas said people get 
angry at their basketball team if they lose in the finals they 
dont treat them so badly if they lose in the semifinals its 
like any loss people are disappointed

the exxon oil slick washed ashore at 
another national park friday as state and federal officials 
criticized the giant corporations entirely inadequate cleanup 
and declared this is a war 
weve got oil on the beach at katmai national park said 
john quinley a park service spokesman 
the the oil washed up at the big river area along the parks 
northern coast a spectacular undeveloped area beside the stormy 
shelikof strait more than 250 miles from where the exxon valdez 
tanker rammed a reef on march 24 
observers from a plane saw a bear digging clams from the tainted 
sand and more wildlife seemed certain to die quinley said 
theres no way to know how much he digested but i think its 
a safe assumption that if bears are eating oiltainted food they 
are not going to be very well he said weve seen pictures of 
dead deer in prince william sound that ate oiltainted kelp and it 
looks like we could be seeing brown bear meeting the same fate 
southwest winds forecast for saturday were likely to push more 
oil ashore quinley said he said exxon planned to send ships with 
floating booms to try to protect nine sensitive coastal areas 
including big river from the oil 
quinley had no details on how much oil had washed ashore and 
exxons offices had closed by the time word came of the oil washing 
ashore 
katmai is a mainland park west of the kodiak group of islands 
officials fear crab salmon herring cod and pollock fisheries 
thoughout the region may be destroyed by the spill 
the coasts of katmai and kodiak have a lot of bird rookeries 
and habitat quinley said and they have numerous rich salmon 
streams 
much of the southern end of kodiak island makes up the kodiak 
national wildlife refuge and kodiak island is the home of the 
largest concentration of brown bears in the world quinley said 
oil sheen also had rounded the tip of the kenai peninsula and 
there were worries currents might carry it north toward kachemak 
bay and fishing and tourism communities including homer 
homer residents were building floating booms to protect their 
shores we were tired of sitting around doing nothing said 
randy holt a carpenter now its time to go to work 
bruce erickson an environmental engineer for the state 
department of environmental conservation said oil churned into a 
thick mousse by waves was sighted at shuyak island and an oil 
sheen was off afognak island 
the oil could threaten kamishak bay a major herring fishery 
norh of cape douglas and the mouth of the mcneil river which 
feeds the bay quinley said the river is a game sanctuary that 
attracts photographers from around the world to take pictures of 
brown bears feeding on salmon 
earlier reports had placed the oil only as far south as the 
barren islands the northernmost in the kodiak archipelago and a 
prime breeding habitat for seabirds 
dennis kelso commissioner of the department of environmental 
conservation said his department has been left on standby three 
weeks after the 101 milliongallon spill officials are awaiting 
exxons plan to clean 3000 shore sites 
no plan has been submitted kelso said i do not think 
there is a written plan but exxon said its plan was nearly 
complete 
we have been working to complete a comprehensive onshore 
cleanup plan with the various agencies and organizations involved 
over the past three weeks to come up with the balance of cleanup 
techniques with minimal environmental damage the oil company 
said in a statement 
gov steve cowper and coast guard commandant paul yost returned 
to survey the hundreds of miles of twisting oily coastline yost 
set a saturday deadline for exxon to produce a cleanup plan for the 
spill which officials said was not breaking up as fast as they had 
hoped 
authorities said they probably would have to use highpressure 
hot water spray to cleanse many beaches a controversial technique 
because it kills organisms on and beneath the surface of the beach 
this is a war yost said 
dont look for a miracle on beachcleaning he said we 
need hundreds of people maybe multihundreds maybe 
multithousands 
cowper who arrived friday wearing faded jeans and rubber boots 
said he was pleased yost had taken over command of the cleanup 
we were not satisfied with the way the operation was being 
coordinated he said i think its obvious that we the state 
and the coast guard are not satisfied with the way exxon has 
performed 
exxon had good intentions he said but good intentions and 
good performance are two separate items 
cowper led loud denunciations of exxon by state officials last 
week threatening even to shut down the transalaska oil pipeline 
but officials had been more muted this week until kelsos latest 
comments 
weve been frustrated by the inthewater cleanup we dont 
want to see that replicated on the shoreline kelso said calling 
exxons efforts entirely inadequate 
added yost im not satisfied with the beach cleanup program 
i want a lot of people on the beach cleaning up 
exxon officials did not respond to a request for comment 
earlier officials had placed the lead section of the spill at 
the barren islands said larry dietrich the director of 
environmental quality for the department of environmental 
conservation 
recent storms broke up the slick less than officials hoped he 
said 
were concerned that its holding together dietrich said 
i dont think its dispersing as well as people had hoped that it 
might 
thousands of sea birds and mammals have died in the oily muck 
and there are fears for the rich fisheries in prince william sound 
but damage has been greatest on the oiled beaches of the 3000 
separate cleanup areas on islands in prince william sound 44 are 
ready for cleanup crews kelso said 
workers are already at a few beaches shoveling up oil scraping 
rocks and using lowpressure hoses to flush the oil back into the 
water where it is trapped and recovered 
a consensus is building to clean the shores with jets of 
highpressure hot water and steam dietrich said but he said 
its going to be difficult to launch a cleanup effort on the 
beaches until the floating product is removed 
the total oil recovered so far was about 9 percent of the spill 
or 882000 gallons deitrich said with some of the remaining 
material having the consistency of asphalt 
cowper said it isnt known whether the steamcleaning machines 
will work in alaskas rugged wilderness because fresh water was 
used in previous operations and crews in prince william sound will 
be using salt water

a judge and jury agreed that the federal 
aviation administration and the pilot of a small plane were equally 
at fault for a 1986 collision of an aeromexico jetliner and the 
plane that killed 82 people 
us district judge david v kenyons decision friday absolved 
aeromexico from any responsibility in the crash 
i think when you weigh all of the possibilities the jury has 
recommended a number which is as fair and reasonable as any figure 
could possibly be he said of the 5050 division of 
responsibility 
the faa was negligent simply by its omission to warn the 
aeromexico plane said kenyon 
the judge said he was unable to determine whether the traffic 
controller walter white saw a blip on the radar screen indicating 
the small plane white has said he didnt see it 
of william kramer the private pilot who was held 50 percent 
liable for the crash kenyon said it was simply a matter of a 
caring diligent man who did not have enough flying time flying 
in what is probably one of the most difficult areas in the world to 
fly the situation simply got away from him 
the collision occurred in clear skies on aug 31 1986 as the 
aeromexico dc9 with 64 people aboard was approaching los angeles 
international airport from the east at 6500 feet 
kramer 53 with his wife and a daughter as passengers was 
flying a singleengine piper that slammed into the jets tail and 
sent both aircraft plunging into the ground all aboard both planes 
and 15 people on the ground in suburban cerritos were killed 
a national transportation safety board report said an air 
traffic controllers failure to see the small plane on his screen 
and warn the airline were factors in the accident 
the jury spent five months hearing testimony and deliberated for 
46 hours over 10 days the jurys ruling friday was binding on the 
estate of kramer but advisory on aeromexico and the faa 
damages will be decided at later trials or by settlement 
the ability of the kramer estate to pay damages is limited to 
12 million from an aviation insurance policy 
the us justice department attorney who tried the case steven 
riegel acknowledged that the government probably will wind up 
paying the majority of damages attorneys have said total damages 
could range from 50 million to 100 million 
we are disappointed that the faa was found liable for 50 
percent riegel said we are reviewing the possibility of 
appeal 
he said the air controller white has been promoted to an faa 
supervisor and is working at a control tower in another 
location 
attorney george archer representing the families of the airline 
crew relayed the comment of the mother of the jets first officer

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has 
filed a criminal complaint against three yugoslavs for criticizing 
his order that author salman rushdie be killed for writing the 
satanic verses a newspaper reported 
the complaint was filed with the belgrade district attorneys 
office under a section of the yugoslav criminal code that forbids 
public humiliation of foreign countries or their leaders 
borba said friday that the penalty for violating the law is up 
to three years imprisonment 
the newspaper said the complaint was filed against stanislav 
marinkovic editor of borba vesna roganovic a journalist for the 
paper and slobodan selenic a popular yugoslav author 
selenic head of the yugoslav writers union was sued because 
of a statement to borba last month about khomeinis frightening

cited for allowing the novel to be published the newspaper said 
a yugoslav secretary who answered the telephone at the iranian 
embassy said no one was available for comment the holy month of 
ramadan began a week ago 
whether khomeini will have his own day in a yugoslav court was 
not clear borba said several yugoslav lawyers were representing 
khomeini 
parts of the satanic verses considered offensive to some 
moslems include a bordello scene in which prostitutes take the 
names of mohammeds wives and the suggestion that the prophet 
wrote the holy koran instead of receiving it from allah 
the book has caused protests worldwide and demonstrations over 
its publication have led to the deaths of at least 19 people in 
pakistan and india two london bookstores in central london were 
set afire sunday in an apparent campaign of intimidation aimed at 
stopping sales of the book 
london detectives refused to say whether more threats of 
violence have been received but scotland yard said in a statement 
friday night last sundays incidents may be the start of a

sharp cutbacks in this citys police 
force and fire department because of budget problems have prompted 
calls for the removal of mayor thomas dunn who has held office for 
a quartercentury 
about 250 police officers firefighters and ambulance personnel 
protested for a fourth straight day friday chanting on city hall 
steps dunn must go and the roof the roof the roofs on 
fire let that burn 
elizabeth population 106000 laid off 93 civilian employees 
70 police officers 53 firefighters and 12 emergency medical 
technicians at 6 pm friday 
the cuts mean a 22 percent reduction in the police force and 20 
percent reduction in the fire department along with the closing of 
two firehouses and four of 11 fire companies said tony valvano 
vice president of the firemans mutual benevolent association in 
elizabeth 
weve supported the mayor right down the line valvano said 
weve done everything possible to help him but hes done nothing 
to help us 
dunns term is up in 1992 the democrat postponed for 45 days 
the layoffs of 169 other employees scheduled to lose their jobs 
the mayor has blamed assembly speaker chuck hardwick of union 
for the citys budget shortfall hardwick a republican 
gubernatorial candidate said a funding source is needed before he 
would allow an assembly vote to bring money to distressed cities 
hardwick criticized dunn calling the layoffs a shameful 
political stunt that unnecessarily jeopardizes public safety 
dunn called hardwick hardheaded and blamed the budget 
problems on garbage disposal costs for the city adjacent to new 
yorks staten island costs have tripled in the last year because 
of environmental laws that force the city to ship its trash out of 
state 
elizabeth received 71 million from the states aid to 
distressed cities program a 30 percent cut from last year it had 
requested 337 million 
valvano said the police and firefighters blame hardwick but 
think dunn is overreacting to the budget problems 
the money is there but hes just not using it valvano 
said were not saying the city isnt in a fiscal crisis it 
probably is but this doesnt have to happen right now we feel 
like mayor dunn has jumped the gun 
the city council earlier this week approved a measure to 
transfer funds earmarked for garbage disposal costs to pay the 
employees for at least another month dunn rejected the move 
saying it broke state law

one out of every three pregnancies in china ends 
in abortion and 32 million abortions were carried out from 1985 to 
1987 an official daily said today 
the englishlanguage china daily quoting earlier reports in the 
chinese press also said 80 percent of abortions were requested by 
women who did not know how to use contraceptives or whose 
contraceptive methods failed 
the daily said 70 percent of chinese women of childbearing age 
use contraception but 56 million do not 
the report came out one day after china marked the birth of its 
11 billionth citizen the government has used the new population 
figure to warn that the nations family planning policies are being 
ignored and china faces severe food and housing shortages if 
population growth is not controlled 
china denies foreign charges of forced abortions for women who 
violate the one child per family policy or become pregnant without 
authorization from their local family planning office 
last year the state planning commission said there were 1039 
million abortions in 1987 or 46 for every 100 live births in the 
united states the abortion rate is approximately one for every 
three live births 
the daily said that of all contraceptive users 40 percent are 
women using intrauterine devices and 38 percent are women who have 
been sterilized another 11 percent are men who have had 
vasectomies 5 percent are women taking contraceptive pills and 3 
percent are men who use condoms 
chinesemade iuds are reportedly of low quality and the report 
said 40 percent of women who use iuds get pregnant

the marxist mayor of sao paulo is 
battling one of brazils richest families in a drive to turn its 
mansion a symbol of brazilian excess into a workers museum 
mayor luiza erundina signed an order tuesday to expropriate the 
huge neoclassical mansion of the matarazzo family believed to be 
brazils most valuable private piece of urban real estate worth 
an estimated 120150 million 
the mayor a member of the socialistoriented workers party 
said she wants to convert the mansion into a workers museum and 
cultural center 
but a lawyer for the matarazzos said the family would fight the 
decision to the end 
the 47000squarefoot white stone mansion with vast gardens 
and servants quarters in the rear sits on a 3acre wooded lot on 
avenida paulista in the heart of brazils most important financial 
center 
the house was built in 1941 by count francesco matarazzo an 
italian immigrant who became an industrialist and one of the 
countrys richest men it was designed by marcello piacentini the 
official architect of italian fascist leader benito mussolini 
today surrounded by skyscrapers and fastfood restaurants the 
matarazzo mansion is a reminder of a bygone age when avenida 
paulista was lined by elegant estates belonging to the cream of sao 
paulo society 
the counts heirs want to demolish the house and sell the 
property but they cant if the government expropriates it 
the mayors chief of staff jose eduardo cardoso said in a 
telephone interview that we have only just begun the 
expropriation process and according to law we have five years to 
conclude it if by 1994 the expropriation is not completed it can 
no longer be carried out 
cardoso said the matarazzo property is valued at 120150 
million which we will have to pay to finalize the 
expropriation 
he said the city will try to get funds from private companies to 
pay for the expropriation because obviously the municipal 
government does not have the money for this kind of thing 
matarazzo lawyer magalhaes said the money could pay for at 
least 30000 low income houses or 10 large hospitals or hundreds 
of day care centers endeavors which would be much more in line 
with a government that claims to be concerned with the wellbeing 
of the poor 
after her election last nov 15 erundina said she would change 
the priorities of past city governments and concentrate on health 
housing and educational projects for the poor

authorities feared for the missing 
young daughters of a winery worker suspected of killing his wife 
three of her relatives and a coworker in a bloody rampage 
police searched for ramon salcido 28 who fled with the three 
girls after going on the shooting battering and stabbing spree in 
northern californias winemaking region on friday sonoma county 
sheriff richard michaelsen said 
the savage attacks on salcidos two sistersinlaw 8 and 12 in 
which both were sexually assaulted and one was nearly decapitated 
heightened fears for his daughters who vanished from the house 
where his wife was slain 
salcido has the three children with him and thats 
scary michaelsen said he may have literally no attachment to 
his own children at this point we feel they are in great danger 
a neighbor who described himself as salcidos best friend also 
feared for the girls lives 
he already killed his wife and he dont care anymore said 
richard clark 
hes crazy he was always going around with a gun said 
clark a 27yearold selfemployed mechanic who said he could see 
it coming 
one time he threatened to blow his wifes head off said 
clark who has known salcido for about four years 
police issued an allpoints bulletin and used helicopters to 
search for salcido after the attacks in an area 60 miles north of 
san francisco 
to go from one crime scene to the next to see this beautiful 
young wife it was incredible michaelsen said then to go 
and see what he did to those little girls 
on march 11 a superior court judge in fresno county about 250 
miles to the south ordered salcido to pay his exwife debra ann 
salcido 511 a month in child support for their 4yearold 
daughter maria crystal garcia 
salcido was told of the order on tuesday but michaelsen 
declined to speculate whether it might have been what pushed 
salcido described as an insecure jealous man enamored of guns 
over the edge 
authorities meanwhile described salcido as extremely 
dangerous they said a witness saw him leave one of the places 
where slayings occurred with several firearms and knives 
they also alerted border police for fear that salcido may be 
heading for his native mexico 
salcidos battered brown ford sedan in which he is believed to 
have fled was found friday evening in san rafael in neighboring 
marin county about 25 miles south of where the attacks occurred 
the sonoma county sheriffs department said 
but there was no sign of the suspect or the three girls 
2yearold teresa 3yearold carmina and 4yearold sofia 
authorities also were looking for a second car salcido might be 
driving 
michaelsen said investigators still were trying to determine the 
bloody sequence of events which occurred in four locations between 
7 am and 10 am 
salcido went to a glen ellen ranch and allegedly wounded kenneth 
butti 33 in the right shoulder police said butti lived at the 
ranch but worked with salcido at the grand cru winery in nearby 
kenwood butti alerted police then was treated at santa rosa 
memorial hospital 
authorities said salcido a grand cru forklift operator also 
went the winery where he fatally shot assistant winemaker tracey 
toovey who was sitting in his car in the winery driveway toovey 
was shot several times in the head 
michaelsen said salcido also killed his wife angela 24 at 
their home in boyes hot springs although the cause of her death 
was unclear michaelsen said she apparently died of a very 
traumatic injury and there was a considerable amount of blood 
in the home 
salcido also went to the cotati home of his inlaws robert and 
marion louise richards 
robert richards was at work when salcido arrived but mrs 
richards and their two daughters marie ann richards 8 and ruth 
richards 12 were at home all three were savagely attacked and 
found dead in three bloodsplattered rooms

the government says it may scrap its 
40year vow to reconquer mainland china if beijing recognizes 
nationalist sovereignty over taiwan 
justice minister hsiao tientzang told the legislative yuan on 
friday that china must approve a one china two governments 
formula being promoted by the nationalists to help the eventual 
reunification of the mainland and taiwan 
whether we continue to fight the communist rebels depends on 
the response from the other side of the taiwan straits hsiao 
said according to a statement issued today by the assembly 
taiwan newspapers in dispatches from tokyo said chinese 
premier li peng who is visiting japan rejected the nationalists 
suggestion on friday because it would require beijing to drop its 
onechina policy 
the decree calling for the reconquering of the mainland was 
imposed in 1949 after the nationalists lost a civil war on the 
mainland and fled to taiwan 
hsiaos statement was in reply to demands by huang huanghsiung 
a member of the opposition democratic progressive party to abolish 
the emergency decree 
huang said the nationalist government has in fact recognized 
communist chinese sovereignty over the people on the mainland by 
pursuing a more flexible policy toward china since last year 
for the past four decades both the nationalists and communists 
have maintained that taiwan is a chinese province and that 
reunification will come under one government 
in 1987 the nationalists ended 38 years of martial law to allow 
the formation of new opposition parties but they retained the 
emergency decree 
as part of its flexible policy taiwan announced last week that 
it will send an official delegation to china for the first time to 
attend the annual meeting of the asian development bank that begins 
in beijing on may 4 
but it said the decision did not signal a change in its 
anticommunist policy and members of the delegation would not 
discuss relations between the rival governments 
the 12member delegation is to be headed by finance minister 
shirley kuo but will include foreign ministry officials 
government officials said foreign ministry representatives were 
included to handle possible protocol problems and would not be 
involved in diplomatic meetings with the chinese

in a boost to the seabrook nuclear power 
plant a federal bankruptcy judge refused to block lowpower 
testing of the reactor and approved a settlement that ensures 
funding until the end of the year 
it is likely that seabrook is ultimately going to go into 
commercial operation said judge james yacos on friday in a 
reorganization hearing of the public service co of new hampshire 
seabrooks lead owner 
yacos rulings helped increase that likelihood by removing some 
financial uncertainty about the 59 billion project 
a seabrook foe disputed yacos prediction saying he based it 
only on testimony from public service and its creditors the 
creditors stand to fare far better in the utilitys reorganization 
if the reactor operates and none of them opposed prompt lowpower 
testing or the plant funding deal 
youve got a record made on that solely by parties who have an 
interest in taking an optimistic view of seabrooks prospects 
who by the way dont have a very good track record in their 
predictions robert backus lawyer for ratepayers and 
antinuclear groups told yacos 
seabrook which was completed in july 1986 but remains stalled 
by evacuation planning and financial problems originally was 
planned for commercial operation in 1979 
yacos replied i deal with what i hear in this court it may 
or may not be reality but thats what i deal with 
the judge acknowledged that there still are questions about how 
a nuclear regulatory commission licensing board will rule on 
remaining seabrook issues and how appeals of those rulings will 
fare 
he said further seabrook delays only would hamper efforts to 
reach an agreement on a public service reorganization plan public 
services seabrook investment represents more than twothirds of 
its assets 
this is simply another matter of leaning toward getting a plan 
before the court for confirmation the judge said of his rulings 
backus had tried to dissuade yacos from approving an agreement 
reached thursday by state officials public service and its 
creditors ensuring that new hampshire ratepayers wont be charged 
for cleaning up seabrook if it conducts the atomic tests but does 
not operate commercially before the agreement was reached state 
officials had asked yacos to delay the tests until commercial 
operation is assured 
yacos said that if the creditors decide to take the risk paying 
the cleanup costs if seabrook never runs commercially he will let 
them 
the owners are still struggling to prove to the nrc they will 
cover the cleanup costs and as a result no prospective date has 
been set for the lowpower tests 
richard tilton lawyer for the stockholders said stalling the 
lowpower tests would lead to a delay in seabrooks commercial 
operation and that risk far outweighs the fairly insignificant 
costs of this settlement

track star zola budd her 
controversial running career on hold today married a south african 
liquor store owner in her hometown of bloemfontein 
budd 22 wed 26yearold mike pieterse at the universitas dutch 
reformed church in a ceremony attended by about 150 people 
the two have known each other for about four years and were 
engaged last august after budd suspended her track career in

budd has been one of the worlds top women distance runners in

palestinian leaders told egypt they would 
accept elections in israelioccupied territories under 
international supervision and after a partial israeli pullback an 
egyptian government source said today 
the proposal came from west bankers led by faisal husseini head 
of the arab studies center in east jerusalem who met with foreign 
minister esmat abdelmeguid on sunday the source said 
the proposals were ideas for consideration that do not amount 
to a cutanddried plan the source said on condition of 
anonymity 
they were a response to a peace plan proposed by israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir and unveiled on a trip to washington 
earlier this month the source said 
shamir suggested israelirun elections be held in the west bank 
and gaza strip to choose representatives with whom israel could 
negotiate palestinian autonomy 
these local palestinians are the people who are bearing the 
brunt of the occupation they are trying to help with ideas 
instead of rejecting things out of hand the source said 
plo officials who turned down the shamir plan indicated they 
opposed the west bankers approach 
saeed kamal cairo representative of the palestine liberation 
organization denied that local palestinians had offered any 
proposals 
this is a big lie kamal told the associated press 
these socalled proposals are only ideas floated by western 
diplomats in jerusalem as far as the plo is concerned any 
proposal involving elections can be made only in the usplo 
dialogue in tunis he said 
those talks began in the tunisian capital in december after plo 
leader yasser arafat recognized israels right to exist renounced 
terrorism and accepted key un resolutions on a middle east 
settlement 
the egyptian source said the west bankers suggested a fourphase 
plan 
first an international force would oversee withdrawal of 
israeli troops from populated areas in the occupied territories to 
fringe positions 
polling then would be held under international supervision to 
elect a parliamentinexile a delegation would be chosen from 
among the parliaments members to negotiate interim selfrule with 
the israelis 
in the final stage the source said the plo and israel would 
negotiate autonomy for occupied territories at an international 
conference 
the plo however demands that all israeli forces leave the west 
bank and gaza as a precursor to internationallysupervised 
elections 
at a meeting with president bush last week shamir proposed his 
plan for israelioverseen elections to choose palestinians to 
negotiate autonomy for the occupied territories 
the egyptian source said the cairo government views the west 
bankers ideas with an open mind we have not taken any position 
yet 
since the uprising against israels occupation of the west bank 
and gaza began in december 1987 more than 425 palestinians and 18 
israelis have died

president hosni mubarak today named defense 
minister abdelhalim abughazala who helped develop egypts strong 
ties with the united states to fill the vacant post of assistant 
president 
the position of assistant president has been largely ceremonial 
but field marshal abughazala is viewed as the second most powerful 
man in the government and his appointment could represent a 
stepping stone to the position of vice president 
the country has had no vice president since mubarak succeeded 
assassinated president anwar sadat in october 1981 mubarak served 
as vice president to sadat from 1975 until the assassination 
the defense ministry which abughazala headed for eight years 
will now be operated by maj gen youssef sabry abutaleb who ran 
cairos government for six years as governor 
mubarak announced the two appointments in decrees and 
immediately swore in the two men to their new posts no explicit 
reason for the changes were given 
afterward prime minister atef sedki told reporters only that 
mubarak needs at his side someone to help him in the huge tasks 
that he has to discharge he said he does not expect further 
cabinet changes 
the last assistant president was former prime minister mamdouh 
salem he died three years ago and the position has been vacant 
since then 
in the last few years there have been frequent reports and 
speculation that mubarak would appoint abughazala as vice 
president abughazala denied the reports 
abughazala 59 served as military attache in washington 
between 1976 and 1979 he was regarded as a prime player in forging 
cairos special relationship with the united states after egypt 
signed a peace treaty with israel in 1979 
he was graduated from cairos military academy in 1949 but he 
later attended military courses both in the soviet union and the 
united states he was an officer in egypts 1956 1967 and 1973 
wars with israel 
abutaleb 60 served longer as cairos governor than anybody 
else since egypt became a republic in 1952 he is widely regarded 
as the best governor modern cairo ever had 
the middle east news agency said his successor is mahmoud 
sherif governor of sharkia province

hu yaobang the former head of chinas communist 
party who was swept from power in a dramatic 1987 purge died of 
heart failure today he was 73

meeting of the politburo the party body which oversaw his downfall 
two years before the official xinhua news agency said

from grace over 1986 prodemocracy student demonstrations 
in a statement read on national television the communist party 
central committee praised hu as a longtested loyal communist 
fighter great proletarian revolutionary statesman and 
outstanding leader 
a photo of hu trimmed in black appeared on the screen before and 
after the announcement while somber music played for about a minute 
national television showed a film of hus trip to western china 
in the early 1980s when he revisited sites he passed through during 
the 193435 long march the red armys epic flight from chiang 
kaisheks nationalists 
xinhua carried a twoparagraph item with a short biography the

february 1980 together with deng and thenpremier zhao ziyang hu 
played an instrumental role in initiating the marketstyle economic 
reforms that have brought prosperity to millions of chinese 
hu dengs longtime bridge partner was widely expected to take 
over dengs functions when chinas senior leader now 84 finally 
stepped down 
but he was always held in suspicion by chinas conservative 
factions in part because of his blunt criticisms of mao tsetungs 
policies and his tendency to state his opinion without consulting 
party members 
in 1987 hu stepped down as communist party secretarygeneral 
after taking the blame for prodemocracy student demonstrations 
that swept the nation in december 1986 he was allowed to retain 
his seat in the 17member politburo

of maos cultural revolution red guards shaved his head forced 
him to crawl on his hands and knees and sent him to rural henan 
province for 2 years of exile

cultural revolution

committee and served as chairman of the party the post once held

innocent people foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze an 
ethnic georgian said in a speech friday to georgias party plenum 
which made the leadership changes 
at a meeting in moscow a group of prominent intellectuals 
including human rights activist andrei d sakharov today blamed 
the clash in tbilisi on moscow bureaucrats who imposed stronger 
security measures last year 
decrees approved at the end of july require advance permission 
for meetings and demonstrations and gave a special force attached 
to the interior ministry special power for keeping order at 
demonstrations 
soviet officials are conducting an investigation to determine 
whether security forces who broke up the demonstration in tbilisi 
killed people by beating them with shovels they had been issued to 
dig trenches 
the group said the killings in georgia threaten president 
mikhail gorbachevs reforms known as perestroika 
this is a knife pushed into the back of perestroika by 
highranking bureaucrats first and foremost i believe by the 
moscow ones said one member of the group economist leonid 
batkin 
sakharov a 1975 nobel peace prize winner and tribuna board 
member sat near batkin but did not speak

for their inability to halt unrest 
in the baltic republics to the north residents in the latvian

a mural in the georgian capital of tbilisi was set 
afire last week by demonstrators and the now charred script 
proclaims brotherhood throughout the ussr 
the message behind the mural has also been under fire recently 
not only in the southern republic of georgia but also in 
neighboring armenia and azerbaijan in the three baltic republics 
and in the ukraine and moldavia 
the latest nationalist demonstrations in georgia in which at 
least 19 people were killed have again demonstrated the ethnic 
divisions of the soviet union and further eaten away at the cement 
holding the countrys more than 100 national groups together 
president mikhail s gorbachev has said relations between 
national groups are his countrys most serious problem 
ronald suny an american scholar specializing in soviet national 
relations called the nationality problem the kremlins achilles 
heel and identified georgia as a potential powderkeg 
in the past year there have been demands for autonomy and even 
independence by estonians latvians lithuanians and moldavians 
ethnic hatred between armenians and azerbaijanis claimed more than 
90 lives 
on april 4 some of georgias 53 million inhabitants fiercely 
independent people whose native son josef stalin is both a source 
of pride and shame began taking to the streets 
some demonstrators objected to a demand put forward march 18 by 
an ethnic minority in western georgia the abkhazians to secede 
from the republic others wanted independence for georgia itself 
abkhazia is an autonomous republic under georgian control with 
505000 residents of whom just 15 percent or 91000 are ethnic 
abkhazians they have contended they suffered an ethnic 
catastrophe and should become a completely separate republic 
the regions party chief bv adleiba was fired after 
endorsing the abkhazian secession call 
the abkhazians had voiced the demand for years without success 
they may have been emboldened to try again because of reforms 
instituted under gorbachev and because of the partial victory of 
residents of another autonomous republic nagornokarabakh 
residents of nagornokarabakh mostly ethnic armenians had been 
under the control of azerbaijan since 1923 but demanded in february 
1988 that their region be allied with the armenian republic 
azerbaijani leaders rejected the demand strikes demonstrations 
and bloody violence followed the central government in moscow 
eventually put nagornokarabakh under kremlin control temporarily 
a second issue behind the tbilisi demonstration was a demand for 
the entire georgian republic to break away from the soviet union 
some residents of the baltic republics of lithuania estonia and 
latvia also have called for secession saying their 
onceindependence republics have suffered since being incorporated 
into the soviet union in 1940 
georgia smaller than south carolina also was once an 
independent nation in 19181921 but russian troops were sent in 
and it was absorbed into the soviet union 
under soviet power georgians have thrived economically because 
the areas warm climate is ideally suited for resorts and growing 
the fruits and vegetables that are scarce elsewhere in the country 
but under leonid i brezhnev ethnic mafias ran the republic 
embezzlement cronyism and bribery were widespread black 
marketeering of farm produce was rampant 
before gorbachev named him foreign minister in 1985 eduard a 
shevardnadze an ethnic georgian served 13 years as the republics 
communist party chief leading a tough anticorruption drive 
gorbachev has sent shevardnadze his top diplomat back to 
georgia to help cool tempers 
authorities tolerated the demonstrations outside the georgian 
governments offices in tbilisi for four days but when the number 
of protesters reached an estimated 100000 on april 7 tanks 
armored personnel carriers and special troops were sent in 
two days later in the early morning darkness soldiers charged 
demonstrators and at least 19 were killed by official count 
the protests were planned to lead up to the anniversary of an 
april 14 1978 tbilisi demonstration that succeeded in defeating 
plans to drop georgian as the republics official language 
like many of the soviet unions nationalities some georgians 
claim they are being russified russian bureaucrats and 
politicians in moscow largely control local politics and economies 
in the rest of the country 
suny a history professor at the university of michigan in ann 
arbor told foreign reporters during a recent seminar in moscow 
that many of the countrys ethnic groups have developed a feeling 
of a nation in danger 
for much of the 71 years of soviet power especially under 
stalins reign of terror the ethnic groups kept silent but 
gorbachevs policies of glasnost or openness and 
perestroika or restructuring have unleashed a torrent of 
complaints from the national groups 
basic nationalities problems have been swept under the rug for 
50 to 60 years now theyre authorities paying for it suny 
said 
gorbachevs liberalization has gone so far he said that the 
demands of the soviet unions nonrussian population cannot be 
limited more nagornokarabakhs are lurking under the surface suny 
said by his count 40 ethnic territories in the soviet union could 
be open to challenge 
gorbachev has shown some sympathy for ethnic activists granting 
their republics more leeway in decisionmaking but as he did in 
the nagornokarabakh dispute the kremlin chief has rejected the 
demands of abkhazian and georgian separatists

in a cramped apartment in grimy northern beijing 
one of chinas top fashion models donned a negligee saturday to 
pose for hollywood photographer douglas kirkland 
chinese photographer li weishun set off in pursuit of pearl 
divers and fishermen on the southeast coast 
national geographic photographer stephanie maze drove through 
hundreds of miles of arid northern chinese wasteland to photograph 
cavedwellers 
a total of 89 photographers from a dozen countries trained their 
lenses on chinese factory workers acrobats duck farmers and 
doctors in an effort to capture the many facets of a day in the 
life of china for a book of that name 
the book will be the ninth in a series of day in the life 
books which has included volumes on the united states japan and 
the soviet union 
david cohen president of collins publishers of san francisco 
said the goal was to create a visual time capsule of the most 
populous nation on earth 
the photographers including 28 chinese took up positions from 
the soviet border in the north to friendship pass on the southern 
frontier with vietnam some faced threeday trips by car train and 
boat to reach their destinations said assignment coordinator bill 
messing 
they will bring back an estimated 120000 pictures of which 
about 275 will be included in the book said project spokeswoman 
patti richards 
kirkland who has photographed such western stars as marilyn 
monroe went to work at the tworoom family home of 19yearold 
model peng li who won a modeling competition last year in salerno 
italy 
yes yes yes he muttered to himself as he circled around 
the calmly smiling ms peng both were oblivious to a sevenmember 
chinese television crew jammed in the apartment to photograph the 
photographer 
cohen said negotiations with the chinese government over the 
project began in august approval came much quicker from beijing 
than from moscow which took three years to approve a book on the 
soviet union that was photographed in 1987 
in the soviet union there was a constant concern of what could 
be shown cohen said here it was a question of money rather 
than politics cohen said the chinese refused to let a western 
photographer go to lhasa the capital of tibet which has been 
closed to foreigners since march 8 under a martial law imposed to 
quell antichinese protests 
they also refused permission to station a foreign photographer 
at friendship pass on the chinesevietnamese border where the two 
countries still have occasional smallscale clashes a chinese 
photographer was assigned to both places cohen said 
the book will be published in time for the 40th anniversary of 
the founding of communist china on oct 1

with hardly a river anyone would swim 
in and forests dead or dying of acid rain it seems europeans have 
decided ecology is not just for leftists anymore 
heightened awareness has pushed the issue from the fringe to the 
fore lending more respectability and clout to the parties that 
first made mother earth a candidate 
members of the onceradical greens hold parliament seats in west 
germany belgium italy and austria berlins governing coalition 
includes greens and frances greens les verts had surprising 
success in municipal elections last month 
ecology parties hope to double their representation in the 
european parliament in elections june 18 and unofficial sister 
parties of the greens have sprung up in the soviet bloc 
little unity is evident among the dozens of parties born of 
concern for mans ravaging of the planet but all benefit from 
growing worry about pollutants in the air water and food supplies 
environmental consciousness has for years been coming to the 
forefront and a number of environmental catastrophes have 
accelerated this said ruth hammerbacher a 36yearold 
sociologist who is the moderate new leader of west germanys greens 
rhine river chemical spills north sea oil slicks and 
radioactive fallout from the chernobyl nuclear disaster finally 
have moved europeans to action on recycling and restraint she said 
a turn to the left among voters also has brightened the 
political fortunes of some european greens 
but greens parties differ widely by country and the result is 
a painfully underdeveloped network of contacts and coordination 
said juergen maier who nurtures the greens fledgling 
international relations 
we have no world development plan said maier a pragmatist 
typical of todays mellower greens in most cases we had little 
to do with the foundation of foreign greens parties 
ms hammerbacher attributes some of the environmentalist 
parties new prominence to the graying of the greens a 
moderating with age that helps attract west german voters the 
party born in the student and antiwar groups of a generation ago 
now is dominated by people pushing 40 
the decision to play politics and build a more cohesive 
international network earns the scorn of such old guard party 
figures as petra kelly who accuses the new leadership of 
abandoning principles in an opportunist quest for power 
despite the new respectability greens parties still have 
limited influence often getting less than 5 percent of the vote in 
national elections they are strongest in west germany with 43000 
members and the support of 89 percent at the polls 
intergreen relations are too informal for a joint strategy in 
the european parliament elections but individual parties across 
the continent seem to smell the same opportunity 
british greens secretary sara parkin told her party conference 
this month she was wildly optimistic about the chances for the 
first time greens candidates are contesting all 78 british seats 
in the 518member legislature based in strasbourg france which 
determines policy and joint strategy on issues affecting the entire 
continent such as the environment 
getting into the british parliament is tougher because of the 
winnertakeall electoral system which contrasts with the more 
flexible proportional representation common on the continent 
frances parliament has no greens but les verts won 926 posts 
in local and regional elections last month resentment of urban air 
pollution is growing in france and les verts focus solely on 
environmental issues 
in italy the verdi party has been in parliament less than two 
years but recent local elections show a steady increase in 
support spokesman gianluca felicetti said it was the only party 
with potential for a notable increase in votes for the european 
parliament 
austrian greens spokesman stefan schennach estimated his partys 
support at about 8 percent nationwide and predicted it would win 12 
seats in the next parliamentary election seven of the current 
parliaments 183 members are greens 
environmentalists have established greens parties in poland 
hungary and the soviet union but none has been granted official 
status 
west germanys greens the originals have the most impressive 
record they have gained respect after six years in the bundestag 
or parliament despite occasional antics and hold 43 of the 519 
seats 
voters now see the possibility of getting greens candidates 
elected they dont fear wasting their vote said helmut lippelt 
a 57yearold historian in the greens delegation 
the partys conduct in the bundestag has changed over the years 
greens still knit occasionally during debates and the parliament 
president censured one recently for shouting accusations but they 
no longer let their guests lob paintfilled balloons at speakers

elk bison and other 
wildlife that survived a rough winter and a slaughter by hunters 
are beginning to benefit from the fires that ravaged the worlds 
oldest national park last summer 
as the snow melts over yellowstone national parks 22 million 
acres new vegetation is springing from soil enriched by nutrients 
that were released by the burning 
in addition moose antelope mule deer bears and other animals 
will enjoy new summer grazing areas burned into previously dense 
stands of lodgepole pine 
the majority of the fire effects will be positive said a 
report last month by the greater yellowstone coordinating 
committee including increased production of grasses forbs and 
shrubs higher protein content in forages lower fiber content 
earlier spring greenup and more diverse diets for elk 
politicians have argued that the national park service and us 
forest service mismanaged the forest fires which blackened nearly 
half the park 
but not all the emerging scenes in yellowstone are picturesque 
many hillsides and meadows are littered with the carcasses of elk 
and bison that failed to survive the winter by historical 
standards the season was not harsh but it was severe enough to 
kill off many old animals that had survived the unusually mild 
winters of the past decade 
and when many elk and bison looking for forage trudged north 
beyond the parks boundaries hunters flocked into gardiner mont 
to shoot them montana officials worried the bison would infect 
cattle with brucellosis which causes cows to abort 
by the end of this past winters hunting seasons yellowstone 
officials estimated 2400 elk were taken along with 527 bison 
the animals deaths generated debate on the need for more winter 
range for the animals north of yellowstone and on the lack of 
environmental logic used when the park was carved out of wyoming 
idaho and montana 117 years ago 
park boundaries are drawn politically said stu coleman 
yellowstones resource management specialist thats why theyre 
so nice and straight if in 1872 they had thought ecologically 
they probably would have stepped back studied the situation and 
drawn the boundaries ecologically 
earlier this month the greater yellowstone coordinating 
committee set a goal of raising 67 million to acquire 18000 
acres of private land north of the park 
we dont bill it as this is the only solution said 
yellowstone superintendent bob barbee but it would relieve the 
problem

oliver north may have severely hurt his 
credibility by telling jurors at his irancontra trial he bought an 
8000 used car with cash kept at home in a closet legal experts 
say 
the most damaging thing that happened to him during the trial 
was the crossexamination on the money that was just 
devastating said washington attorney john nields who was one of 
norths interrogators at the 1987 congressional hearings when he 
was chief counsel to the house irancontra committee 
nields and three other lawyers interviewed after eight weeks of 
trial testimony ended friday said the crossexamination of north by 
prosecutor john keker may be damaging for the defense 
final arguments are to begin tuesday and the case could go to 
the jury by thursday 
one of the lawyers interviewed said the former national security 
council aide might well be acquitted of the most serious charges 
including an allegation he pocketed money from nicaraguan rebels 
but all four agreed that norths assertion that he covered the 
1985 car purchase from a 15000 stash of money in a box bolted to 
the closet floor was troublesome for the defense 
to have come up with a locked box on the floor for your 
explanation for large expenses when you are taking travelers checks 
from your contra kitty looks terrible nields said 
it is fishy to have 15000 in your closet nobody does 
that said paul rothstein a professor at georgetown university 
law center i am not entirely convinced the jury is going to 
think its smelly it just depends on their personal experience 
besides charges he lied about his secret help of the nicaraguan 
rebels north is also accused of diverting to his personal use some 
4300 of the 90000 to 100000 worth of travelers checks given 
to him by a contra leader 
the retired marine lieutenant colonel testified that he only 
reimbursed himself for expenses incurred helping the rebels 
he told jurors that on the advice of the late cia director 
william casey he destroyed ledger he kept to document all 
disbursements from the secret operational fund 
north also denied kekers suggestion that he took 3000 in cash 
from arms dealer richard v secord to help buy an 8038 used car 
in 1985 
north said the money came from a family fund he kept in a 
metal box bolted to the floor of his closet the money was amassed 
from an insurance settlement and change he emptied from his pants 
pockets every friday night north said 
north said he took 5000 to buy a station wagon but decided 
instead to purchase the more expensive car north testified he put 
down the 5000 and paid the additional 3000 later for the gmc 
suburban vehicle 
but a usedcar salesman disputed this testimony on friday 
saying north had called him several times inquiring about a 
newspaper ad for the gmc vehicle north told him he intended to 
partially finance the purchase through the white house credit 
union the salesman said 
a former national security council secretary who disbursed 
expense accounts said north was so pinched for cash in 1984 he 
complained he couldnt buy lunch or gas to drive home 
she said these complaints stopped in 1985 when north controlled 
a secret fund for the contras in his office safe 
i think the business of the purchase of the car and perhaps 
the rebuttal testimony from the usedcar salesman and the secretary 
from the national security council may be damaging said former 
watergate prosecutor richard benveniste 
about the time these payments start coming in the jury may 
conclude that the temptation for all of this money was just too 
much for ollie north said benveniste 
if the jury finds he was involved in selfdealing then his 
whole posture of moral rectitude is not going to wash said 
benveniste who stressed that he did not attend the trial based 
his views solely only on reports about the proceeding 
alan m dershowitz a harvard university law professor said the 
defense failure to question north again after kekers damaging 
crossexamination was a serious mistake 
jurors were left with an image of north explaining how he used a 
departmentstore typewriter to type letters to help fabricate proof 
he paid for a 13800 security fence around his home 
north said he accepted the fence to protect his family in the 
face of terrorist threats but admitted the coverup 
the last image they jurors had of north is being destroyed 
on going and typing those letters dershowitz said 
north is also charged with illegally accepting the security 
system from secord 
dershowitz also faulted defense attorney brendan v sullivan jr 
for not bringing out the carpurchase story during norths direct 
testimony instead of leaving it to be developed by keker on 
crossexamination 
sullivan left far too much for keker he didnt sufficiently 
deflect and defuse the nuclear weapons that keker had in his 
arsenal dershowitz said 
the car story should have been told to the point of boredom so 
that when keker crossed on it the jury would have been yawning 
unless north didnt tell his lawyers i think sullivan just 
bungled it dershowitz said 
sullivan has refused to comment outside the courtroom on any 
aspect of the case against north 
rothstein alone said north made a strong case for acquittal 
saying his explanation about the travelers check except the 
carpurchase account was a believable story 
all agreed that the equivocal testimony by former national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane weakened the prosecutions case 
that north lied to congress 
mcfarlane blamed north for giving him false information for 
letters that the former national security adviser wrote to 
congress but he backed off major points and changed his story 
although mcfarlane testified as a prosecution witness he blew 
hot and cold rothstein said 
rothstein suggested that sullivan may be gently suggesting that 
the jury convict north of the securityfence charge but not the 
other charges 
thats a nice compromise verdict that the jury can find if 
they are torn between guilt or innocence thats not too bad a 
result for north rothstein said 
the gratuity charge carries a 2year sentence the lightest 
penalty of the 12 counts against north

the appointment of a jesuit as president of the 
new york public library has pitted some of the citys literary 
lions against each other and raised questions about whether his vow 
of papal obedience could compromise scholarship free speech and 
the rights of homosexuals 
the rev timothy healy president of georgetown university 
agreed in february to succeed vartan gregorian who was leaving to 
become president of brown university 
at georgetown healy had a reputation as a good teacher and an 
exceptional fundraiser the schools endowment rose from 30 
million to almost 250 million during his 13 years there not 
coincidentally the library which bills itself as one of the five 
greatest in the world with four research branches and 81 
neighborhood branches is in the midst of a campaign to raise 157 
million from private sources 
the selection was greeted by a wave of hosannas the president 
of the american council on education said healy would get the 
movers and shakers of new york interested in the library former 
un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick who teaches at georgetown 
called healy a nearly perfect fit for the job and a man who 
really loves new york and has the style of a richard burton 
the 65yearold healy a native new yorker who once worked 
summers stacking books at the library seemed to have found a 
fitting place to end his career its home he said i grew 
up in this town 
but last month the weekly village voice ran a story headlined 
scholar or bigot that focused on healys clashes with gay 
student groups at georgetown and a new york times editorialist 
wondered why a church with a critical shortage of priests could 
find no better use for this one than running a public library 
in a letter to the times author gay talese wondered about a 
conflict between the jesuits vow of obedience to the pope and the 
librarians obligations to those who disagree with his church 
taleses letter brought a rebuttal from author garry wills who 
accused him of raising the issue of catholic loyalty that was 
brought against john f kennedy in 1960 is mr talese hinting 
that an american catholic cannot believe in freedom of the press 
next up was catch22 author joseph heller who said wills 
missed the point healy he wrote is not just any catholic he is 
a priest of a church with stern outspoken attitudes toward such 
matters as obscenity heresy blasphemy birth control and a host 
of others the letter wondered if a priest could be head of a 
secular public institution 
meanwhile some homosexuals complained that healy refused to 
recognize gay student groups at georgetown and tried to deny them 
access to school facilities they also questioned how he would 
treat homosexuals who work at the library other library staffers 
said his presence could have a chilling effect on their efforts to 
foster knowledge on such subjects as aids 
healy declined a request for an interview but in an interview 
with the times he said there would be no conflict between his 
religious and academic vocations 
i work for the board of trustees he said no 
ecclesiastical authority has any power over me in the conduct of my 
business at the library none if a conflict arose he said he 
would quit the job 
in recent years several priests and nuns have run into 
conflicts because of their secular jobs in government 
the rev robert drinan of boston a jesuit gave up his seat in 
the us house in 1980 when the pope decreed that a priest could 
not also hold political office 
a nun arlene violet quit the sisters of mercy to become rhode 
island attorney general in 1984 another nun agnes mary monsour 
chose to leave the sisterhood to remain director of michigan social 
services which handles some abortion funding 
but healy said that while he served as vice chancellor for 
academic affairs at the city university of new york a public 
institution from 1969 to 1976 there was never any religious 
tension he also noted that he has permission from his order to 
run a public library 
about the sanctity of research healy said that at georgetown 
he was acting as the head of a catholic institution that could not 
condone sex outside marriage the new york public library is not 
a catholic institution he said

secretary of state james a baker iii will 
discuss possible ussoviet cooperation in fighting terrorism when 
he meets with his soviet counterpart in moscow next month 
administration officials say 
the issue arose briefly when baker met with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze in vienna in march and since then 
us officials have been exploring ways they think the soviets 
might be able to help the sources said 
the us view of such cooperation soured a bit following 
disclosure recently that moscow secretly sold su24 bombers to 
libya 
libya leader col moammar gadhafi supports terrorism baker said 
in a speech friday and how does this sale assist in the 
worldwide efforts supposedly supported by moscow to control 
chemical weapons that libya is developing at its rabta plant 
the state department counterrorism office remains cool to the 
idea of cooperating with the kremlin but it has found some support 
with the european bureau which handles daytoday affairs with 
moscow said administration officials who spoke on condition they 
not be identified by name 
baker in confirmation hearings before the senate said he 
wanted to discuss terrorism within the framework of ongoing 
ussoviet negotiations 
a us position is being prepared for the bakershevardnadze 
meeting to determine the extent to which the soviets are willing to 
cooperate the sources said 
the departments annual report on terrorism said that despite a 
more constructive approach the soviets continued to provide 
arms training and materiel and diplomatic support to a range of 
states and groups linked to terrorism 
hope may be drawn from the fact that the soviets are training 
fewer people overall said an administration terrorism expert 
moscow and its allies according to western analysts and 
intelligence operatives have trained palestinian and other 
terrorists and provided safe haven for such terrorists as abu 
nidal who for years was allowed to maintain an office in poland 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has said he was prepared 
to cooperate with the united states in fighting terrorism a senior 
official of the kgb intelligence service said in a radio moscow 
interview in january that in counterrorism we are willing if 
there is a need to cooperate even with the cia british 
intelligence and the israeli mossad and other services in the 
west 
in one concrete example last december soviet authorities 
negotiated directly with israel with which they do not have 
diplomatic ties and obtained the return of four people who 
commandeered a soviet plane to israel 
state department officials also were heartened by an unusual 
ussoviet conference last january in moscow which did not 
involve governmenttogovernment contacts but was attended by 
several leading american experts on terrorism 
two of the americans robert kupperman of the center for 
strategic and international studies in washington and brian 
jenkins of the rand corp sometimes work as government 
consultants although both stressed that they went to moscow as 
private citizens 
the russian side included officials from the ministry of foreign 
affairs and the ministry of internal affairs which runs the 
domestic police 
kupperman said he was surprised at how far the soviets were 
willing to go in exploring specific steps each nation could take 
against actions that for example could involve mass casualties 
including nuclear chemical or biological incidents 
jenkins who is publishing a report on the meeting said the 
participants backed away from some of the most contentious 
issues such as training the soviet union has in the past supplied 
to some of these organizations 
jenkins describing himself as hardnosed skeptic proposed 
establishing guidelines to judge whether the soviets are in fact 
cooperating 
such guidelines would provide a rough measure of soviet 
political support for socalled national liberation movements 
military aid to guerrillas and help the soviets give to terrorists 
such as abu nidal 
but said jenkins we cannot establish impossible criteria we 
have to acknowledge that the soviet government is big with 
competing elements and some of those elements are going to 
continue to do things that we think they ought not to do 
we cannot find out whether this is a ploy without exploring 
this further said jenkins 
we also have to keep in mind that we have difficulties 
sustaining international cooperation against terrorism even among 
countries with whom we have shared common political and legal 
traditions for two centuries and who have been our military allies 
for four decades said jenkins

americas worstever oil spill reached the 
shore of a second national park raising fears today that bears 
would join sea mammals birds and deer as casualties of the exxon 
valdez wreck 
oil washed up friday at the big river area along the northern 
coast of katmai national park an undeveloped area beside the 
shelikof strait more than 250 miles from where the tanker rammed a 
reef on march 24 
observers from a plane saw a bear dig clams from the oiltainted 
sand said park service spokesman john quinley 
weve seen pictures of dead deer in prince william sound that 
ate oiltainted kelp and it looks like we could be seeing brown 
bear meeting the same fate quinley said 
park officials said bears are just beginning to come out of 
hibernation and heading to beaches to feed 
the weather forecast held more bad news winds from the 
southeast were expected to push more oil ashore in the area 
exxon was to hand over a detailed shoreline cleanup plan today 
to the head of the coast guard adm paul yost the plan was to 
include the number of people and the amount of gear needed to begin 
scouring some of the 3000 beaches blackened by the oil spill 
oil has been washing ashore at kenai fjords national park for a 
week and residents of such fishing and tourist towns as homer 
kodiak seldovia and port graham were preparing to try to block the 
spreading spill today 
but encouraging signs also emerged 
pilot bill decreeft flew over the nuka bay area late friday to 
help track the oils progress i was quite encouraged he said 
today i saw places where oil had hit the beach but essentially 
it looks like it always did 
big river was no 2 on a list of nine places at katmai where 
park officials believe floating booms may be able to shield salmon 
spawning areas brown bear habitat bird nesting areas and native 
alaskan sites from the ribbons of oil 
exxon was to send ships with booms in today but some residents 
of kodiak the nations no 1 port in terms of dollars earned were 
unwilling to wait that long quinley said friday night 
twelve fishing vessels set out for the katmai coast tonight to 
try to control the oil he said 
he had no details on how much oil had washed up and exxons 
offices had closed for the night 
by friday the thick oil and sheen from the crash of the exxon 
valdez tanker had drifted down prince william sound defiling 
thousands of boulderstrewn beaches 225 miles southwest to the tip 
of the kenai peninsula where sea currents divide 
some oil then moved down the east side of the kodiak islands 
with spottings reported at afognak island and as far south as the 
waters of the community of kodiak about 300 miles from the 
accident site 
the oil that was on the other side of the kodiak archipelago and 
had threatened the katmai park included a 40squaremile patch of 
heavy oil and sheen in shelikof strait 
thousands of birds and mammals have died in the washedup muck 
and there were continued fears of damage to salmon herring crab 
and other rich fisheries throughout the region 
the exxon valdez a 987foot tanker veered sharply out of 
shipping lanes and rammed the reef early good friday morning 
yost the coast guard chief who has taken over direction of the 
cleanup has called the effort to deal with the spill a war 
he vowed to put soldiers on the beaches for the cleanup if 
needed but said he would promise no miracles in what is sure to be 
a monthslong effort he and state authorities have been highly 
critical of exxons cleanup efforts during the past three weeks 
scientists were assembling a list of critical and noncritical 
beaches for cleanup yost said highpressure hotwater jets would 
be used to cleanse at least some of the shore although the method 
likely would leave behind sterile dead beaches 
its my view that wed do better with high pressure and heat 
and doing some environmental damage he said the beaches will 
recolonize in a year or two they wont if the oil is not removed

the blueandwhite signs dot oklahoma 
highways informing motorists that the stretch of asphalt has been 
adopted by a fraternity a humane society a motorcycle club 
theyre part of an effort to put everyday people to the unending 
task of keeping highways from looking like garbage dumps and 
officials say that despite some concerns about safety the 
adoptahighway idea is booming 
its going into beautification and really a pride of 
communities not only that but competition between 
communities which adds even more emphasis said wayne muri 
chief engineer for the missouri highway and transportation 
department 
nine hundred groups are participating in missouri and theyve 
not only picked up trash theyve planted millions of daffodils 
in oklahoma which began the program in 1987 gov henry bellmon 
joined 20000 volunteers april 8 in the states first trashoff in 
all 1000 groups have adopted a couple of miles of highway and get 
to see their name on the sign 
the birthplace of the notion was texas which had a problem that 
was well texassized the problem gave rise to a dont mess 
with texas celebrity ad campaign and the adoptahighway program 
which now involves more than 3250 groups 
more than 20 states have followed with their own adoptahighway 
programs 
texas highway officials concerned about liability for the people 
out picking up trash decided on a oneyear pilot program just 
around tyler but demand for the program was too great from people 
elsewhere 
we bit the bullet and went with it said billy black a 
public affairs officer for the texas highway department who was 
codeveloper of the program were getting sued for something 
every day anyway 
some states like south dakota are still drawing up safety 
rules 
weve been very fortunate muri said in missouri the 
folks out there have been very safety conscious 
in oklahoma joanne orr beautification director for the 
department of transportation said the state has developed an 
eightminute videotape on safety wear gloves stay on one side of 
the road at a time and dont pick up syringes or guns 
the signs cost the highway departments about 35 groups must 
pick up litter four times a year or the signs come down oher 
expenses include trash bags and personnel to pick up the bagged 
litter 
officials say the expense is well worth it oklahoma has 
116000 acres of roadside that in effect is our front yard

the showdown between president bush and 
congress over the minimum wage is an eagerly contested battle many 
believe will set the course of the nations domestic and political 
agenda for the 101st congress if not the next four years 
with democrats in congress pushing an ambitious package of 
domestic programs the new administration opposes both sides of the 
minimumwage fight view this first confrontation as a major test of 
resolve 
if the president gets rolled on the minimum wage then we will 
see a plethora of big and bigger spending programs at a time in our 
countrys history when we can least afford it said republican 
sen orrin hatch of utah 
what george bush has done here is hes chosen this issue to 
make a stand hatch said in an interview friday this is a big 
stakes game 
democrats see it that way was well 
were going to battle on this issue until we get it done and 
were going to be successful said sen edward m kennedy 
dmass the minimum wage has helped get a lot of democrats 
elected over the years and contributed to the defeat of a lot of 
republicans this is a classic confrontation between democrats as a 
party which cares for working people and republicans who dont 
republicans concede democrats may win a political issue if the 
president vetos legislation raising the minimum wage 
democrats and organized labor are preparing to promote the issue 
as one of fairness in the mold of their successful campaign last 
year to win public support for legislation giving workers advance 
notice of plant closings 
they also are quick to talk about bushs support for reducing 
capital gains taxes which would predominantly benefit the wealthy 
the president wants thousands of dollars in capital gains 
taxes for the rich but he cant spare three dimes for the working 
poor said kennedy that will linger 
but bush who lost the john tower nomination fight in the 
senate appears ready to ignore the potential political risk in 
order to notch a victory 
thirty cents and four months separate the democrats and bush on 
the minimum wage which has been 335 an hour since 1981 the 
legislation soon to reach the white house would raise the floor to 
455 an hour by october 1991 and allow some workers to be paid a 
subminimum their first two months on the job bush has insisted he 
will go no higher then 425 an hour and only if employers can pay 
a subminimum for six months 
bush himself has acknowledged the significance of the battle 
ending a recent statement of his intention to veto the democrats 
minimum wage bill with the declaration i have too much at 
stake 
democrats say bush has picked the wrong time for a fight 
public opinion is overwhelmingly on our side and every section 
of the country understands the economic justice of our position 
said kennedy it amazes me that the president bush let himself be 
trapped by the right wing of his party into making these veto 
threats 
yet it is kennedy and fellow democrats who set the agenda on 
capitol hill and they chose to tackle the minimum wage first 
before moving on to other items on a lengthy domestic agenda that 
includes legislation governing parental leave child care health 
care and other issues on which the congress and white house have 
major differences 
theyre picking the fight because they see a political 
winner said hatch theyre trying to stick it to him the 
president has to assert himself now 
kennedy concedes bush now has the votes to sustain a veto 
although he said he was not prepared to say this fight isnt 
winnable 
labors top lobbyist joined kennedy in promising political 
troubles to those who side with bush 
the people who are stopping the increase will have to face the 
political consequences said the aflcios robert mcglotten 
the outcome of the fight certainly will dictate the direction 
of the 101st congress said mcglotten and because of that at 
the white house they think they have to draw the line on the first 
bill 
mcglotten said he expects a bush veto but added everytime i 
say that i remember ronald reagan said never on plant closing and 
now we have a law 
thenvice president bush took heat during his presidential 
campaign when reagan vetoed the plantclosing bill and when 
congress passed it again bush reportedly urged reagan not to veto 
it again 
hatch said those electionyear pressures are missing this time 
and that bush would lose stature if he gave in on the minimum wage 
he needs to send a message that he is strong enough to use his 
veto power and that he is not going to be pushed just because there 
may or may not be a political advantage to the democrats said 
hatch

folk medicines for ailments such as fever and 
chicken pox are contributing to a high rate of lead poisoning among 
hmong children officials say 
last year the southeast asian children made up more than 60 
percent of the lead poisoning cases reported to the city public 
health division in the first several months of this year eight of 
13 cases were hmong the division said 
while health officials attribute most of the cases to 
environmental factors such as lead paint chips in old housing and 
contaminated soil they say the hmongs use of medicinal powders is 
a contributing factor 
over the past six years tests of medicinal powders used by some 
hmong families found some with high levels of lead and arsenic 
including one batch containing 90 percent lead said tim ringhand 
a public health nurse 
despite warnings hmong parents continue using the medicine 
because they find it hard to believe their children are in danger 
officials said there is no hmong word for lead and effects of lead 
poisoning dont show up for years 
for hmong people its not because theyre not caring of their 
children said pam thao a bilingual health assistant the 
problem is theyre too protecting they dont trust outsiders 
some members of the hmong community said the studies linking 
lead to their medicinal powders are an attack on their culture 
weve been using the medicine for years long before the birth 
of this country said nkajlo vangh president of lao family 
community of minnesota id like to get a second opinion 
health officials said have no firm idea of how prevalent the 
medicinanl powders are because few families admit to using them 
if they took away my tylenol in laos and gave me powders 
then id be angry too id hide my tylenol ringhand said

the magnolia tree is in full bloom and 
sprinklers cast a soft mist on the flower beds lainz hospitals 
welltended grounds are peaceful a quiet facade behind which a 
tale of multiple murder was played out 
the shadow of death lies over pavilion five where four nurses 
aides have confessed to killing at least 49 elderly patients with 
injections which they are not supposed to administer or by 
forcing water into a victims lungs 
they claimed to have done it out of mercy but police say the 
methods were not merciful 
tragedy grief and misfortune are everpresent in hospitals and 
people who work in them know the analgesic value of routine 
in the wards and corridors of lainz it continues unchanged 
beds are made patients fed temperatures taken 
so strong was the impulse to cling to routine despite the 
killings that when a reporter asked to interview a ranking 
hospital doctor a secretary asked whats it about 
an hour later she too was struck by the sense of shock and 
depression patients say has begun to stalk the wards and said with 
a gasp the boss has been suspended 
that was five days after austria first learned of the killings 
in the hospital department run by the suspended doctor franz 
pesendorfer a respected internist in his early 50s 
at first the story seemed too incredible even for tabloids that 
deal in lurid tales of sex and crime the neue kronen zeitung 
austrias largest circulation daily carried a bold headline but 
had only a small story inside 
two days later when four nursing assistants were said to have 
confessed to at least 44 killings the story covered seven pages in 
the papers editions for sunday april 9 
leaks to news media apparently from police revealed such 
graphic details that police chief guenter boegl reluctantly 
confirmed the stories at an unusual sunday news conference 
the medical profession was stunned 
i wasnt surprised i wasnt horrified i just couldnt 
imagine how it happened said hildegard fach head of the 
national union for nurses and their aides 
its incomprehensible she added in an interview six days 
after the first word of the murders everywhere i go colleagues 
are saying can you imagine 
as the shock sank in public anger mounted and trust in viennas 
overtaxed health services began to evaporate 
by friday a week after the first reports city health director 
alois stacher had received so many reports of nurses and their 
aides being yelled at in the streets that he appealed to viennese 
to stop 
psychiatrist stefan rudas said of the sense of mistrust in 
hospitals its as if waiters in a restaurant had served poison 
or teachers killed their pupils 
ms fach said she hopes one result of the killings will be more 
money for health services 
people in austria will have to realize that health costs 
money and that you cant scrimp she said 
medical students in vienna often say there is little prospect of 
finding jobs in city hospitals although they know they are needed 
according to ms fach the city needs 200400 qualified nurses 
she said a study last year found that 1600 more were necessary if 
patients were to be guaranteed optimal care and nurses a 
43hour work week 
she and other medical personnel have said repeatedly that vienna 
hospitals only keep going by violating regulations that bar nurses 
aides from giving injections except in emergencies doctors are 
not even supposed to turn injections over to registered nurses 
waltraud wagner the 30yearold nursing aid said to be 
responsible for most of the lainz killings was reported to have 
put to rest elderly patients with injections of insulin 
tranquilizers and other medicines 
according to the police warrant she showed fellow aides maria 
gruber 25 irene leidolf 27 and stefanie mayer 50 how to 
prepare the deadly injections and let them watch while she held a 
patients tongue and poured water into the lungs 
two central questions still unanswered are why did they do it 
and how did the killings continue over several years without 
exposure 
all the women except ms mayer are from large families in small 
villages their pay is low and they had little spare money but 
they got no richer by killing impoverished old people 
a twisted sense of mercy killing or a sense of power may have 
played a part but that would not explain why they worked together 
as ms fach noted 
nearly all medical personnel in other countries have acted alone 
when they killed elderly patients and claimed they wanted to 
release them from agony 
police warrants suggest the killings began in 1983 
investigators were called to lainz hospital almost exactly a year 
ago after dr pesendorfer heard rumors that nurses aides in his 
department were killing patients 
he and another doctor refused in an action now widely 
criticized to name the doctor who had passed on the initial tip 
from a nurses aide 
investigator max edelbacher said police finally tracked down the 
doctor alois waschnig and played almost a game of 
hideandseek to speak with him 
waschnig refused to reveal his source and edelbacher said police 
could not force him to do so 
an autopsy at the time on an 84yearold woman ms wagner is 
said to have admitted killing also turned up nothing suspicious and 
the case was closed

a chainlink fence holding back 
thousands of people at a soccer match collapsed today and a 
spokesman for an ambulance company said 95 people were crushed to 
death and 180 injured 
some of the fans apparently died when the surging crowd jammed 
them against the fence located at one end of the stadium others 
were killed when the barrier caved in and the crowd fell toward the 
field the fence was topped with curved steel bars designed to stop 
spectators from climbing over it 
news reports indicated the area of the stadium was overcrowded 
because many fans had entered without tickets 
television pictures showed scores of fans lying on the field 
being treated by emergency ambulance crews dozens of fans were 
carried away on stretchers or on advertising billboards used as 
makeshift beds 
the accident occurred in the opening minutes of the english 
football association cup semifinal between liverpool and nottingham 
forest two leading teams at hillsborough stadium in sheffield 
150 miles north of london 
the game was six minutes old when a fence holding thousands of 
liverpool fans behind one of the goals collapsed crushing the 
spectators 
ray clarke spokesman for the ambulance service said in a 
telephone interview that 95 people died and 180 were injured in the 
accident the worst disaster ever at a british soccer event 
although americans call the game soccer all other countries refer 
to it as football 
football association officials said many of the liverpool 
backers entered the section without tickets through a gate that was 
either broken or opened swelling the section allocated for its 
fans beyond the permitted capacity 
it looks a desperate situation said the football 
associations chief executive graham kelly i am deeply sorry 
that the day has ended this way we had six minutes of football and 
one and a half hours of absolute bedlam 
officially the game attracted a capacity crowd at the 
54000seat hillsborough facility 
but reports said hundreds more liverpool fans without tickets 
poured through a turnstile gate behind one of the goals packing an 
area marked off for the teams followers and crushing those at the 
front of the stand 
a gate or gates were opened or broken and fans came in 
kelly said there were too many fans in the area obviously and 
they spilled over there will be a full investigation 
one unidentified fan told the bbc people just walked in that 
gate and the police just let them walk in there are people lying 
dead there on the floor it was chockablock and as people tried to 
get into the front the police tried to force them back into the 
ground this ground was allocated for an fa cup final because it 
could have dealt with any problems and now it hasnt 
the english football association cup is the worlds oldest 
domestic single elimination soccer tournament and the winners of 
the liverpoolforest semifinal were assured a place in next months 
championship game at wembley stadium 
ninety minutes after the incident the ground was virtually 
cleared by police and the game canceled 
reports said crowd violence played no part in the crush which 
appeared to be purely a result of overcrowding 
the tragedy came less than a week after the ruling body of 
european soccer the union of european football associaitons 
announced it was lifting its ban on english teams in time for the 
199091 season 
the ban was imposed after the may 1985 heysel stadium tragedy in 
brussels belgium in which 39 supporters most of them italian 
died in a stampede by liverpool fans at the european champions cup 
final against juventus of turin 
todays disaster was the worst ever at a british soccer event 
on jan 2 1971 66 people died when an overcrowded stairway 
collapsed during a local soccer match between glasgow rangers and 
celtic in glasgow scotland fiftysix fans died on may 11 1985 
when a fire engulfed the main stand during a match at bradford 
citys soccer stadium near sheffield 
the worst soccer disaster on record took place on may 24 1964 
when rioting left nearly 300 dead and 500 injured after argentina 
beat peru on a lastminute goal in lima

a 72yearold christian parliamentarian 
died saturday when a rocket hit his apartment building during 
shelling duels between syrian and christian gunners police said 
a lebanese navy gunboat ferried 14 badly wounded christians to a 
french naval vessel anchored off beirut as a french humanitarian 
aid mission got under way it was unclear whether moslems would 
participate 
police said intermittent shelling duels intensified before 
sundown as gunners from both sides blasted beirut and its 
surroundings killing four people and wounding 31 
the casualties raised the overall toll to 219 dead and 758 
wounded from the fiveweek battle between gen michel aouns 20000 
mostly christian troops and an alliance of syrian and druse forces 
an italian tanker with a cargo of diesel oil the cochinella 
was hit by a shell eight miles off beirut on saturday an italian 
embassy official said 
the embassys charge daffaires attilo iannucci said the top 
deck was damaged but none of the 14 italian crewmen was hurt he 
said the ship which was heading for the christian port of jounieh 
north of beirut was returning to cyprus 
a police spokesman said the legislator louis abu sharaf was 
killed when a rocket landed near his apartment on the third floor 
of an eightstory building in christian east beirut he said the 
rockets were launched from the divided capitals moslem sector 
abu sharaf was the first legislator to die in a shelling attack 
in lebanons 15yearold civil war he represented christian 
kesrouan province since 1960 
his death raised to 23 the number of deputies who died since the 
last parliamentary elections in 1972 
the war between christians and moslems has prevented 
parliamentary elections since then and abu sharifs death reduced 
the number of deputies in the 99seat house to 75 
the current violence erupted march 8 after aoun ordered a 
blockade of militiarun ports that strip the state treasury of 
about 1 million annually in lost customs dues 
druse militiamen started shelling the christian enclave in 
retaliation 
the syrians who maintain 40000 troops in predominantly moslem 
areas under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate joined in the 
shelling duel on the side of the druse 
the french naval ship la rance dropped anchor 10 miles off the 
christian port of jounieh where frances minister for humanitarian 
aid bernard kouchner was supervising a mercy mission 
france has strong ties with lebanon which it ruled from world 
war i until independence in 1943 
the fully equipped hospital ship was one of two carrying 
humanitarian aid which french officials say is intended for both 
christians and moslems 
but moslems have said france was taking sides in the war and 
renounced claims to their part of the aid 
according to an agreement kouchner reached with moslems the 
second ship was to unload its cargo of fuel oil at two government 
ports in moslem and christian sectors the fuel is badly needed to 
keep lebanons power stations operating 
a lebanese navy gunboat took wounded christians to the la rance 
and then returned with medicine for hospitals in the 
310squaremile christian enclave northeast of beirut 
a moslem official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
kouchner was trying to persuade salim hoss who heads the moslem 
cabinet in lebanons dual government to allow a similar evacuation 
of wounded moslems from west beirut 
the rival christian and moslem cabinets emerged in september 
after outgoing president amin gemayel named aoun a maronite 
catholic like himself to head an interim military cabinet pending 
parliaments election of a new head of state 
but moslems and leftists pledged allegiance to hoss who 
governed under gemayel they claimed aouns appointment violated an 
unwritten convention that made lebanons president a maronite the 
premier a sunni and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem

the fiscal 1990 budget pact between president 
bush and congress produced in weeks of highlevel bargaining and 
praised as a lofty success by its authors is already coming under 
fire 
these critics see the plan as a failure that soothes a political 
headache for lawmakers and the president while taking only a 
fainthearted whack at the governments fiscal malaise 
by its own reckoning the deal whittles the troublesome federal 
deficit to 994 billion just within the 100 billion target 
required by the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
and in the highoctane politics of the 12 trillion budget in 
which protracted pitched battles between democrats and republicans 
are waged over the tiniest fractions of overall spending an 
agreement of any kind is indisputably a major plus 
the most significant aspect of this agreement is its existence 
and that is no small accomplishment senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine said at the rose garden ceremony at which 
bush and congressional leaders announced the accord 
but it is the assumptions the agreement makes the savings it 
claims the work that remains to be done and the deficit problem it 
leaves unaddressed that have many people raising their eyebrows 
if american corporations prepared their financial statements 
based on the way this proposal was put together their officers 
would go to jail said carol cox president of the bipartisan 
committee for a responsible federal budget and a former senate 
budget committee aide 
the white house says it expects the deficit for fiscal 1989 
which ends sept 30 to be about 163 billion 
but administration and congressional leaders say they need only 
find about 28 billion in savings to shrink the red ink for next 
year to 994 billion 
the rest of the reductions will occur automatically they say 
because the economy will perform so well that the government will 
take in more revenues and have to pay lower interest rates for the 
money it borrows most economists are more pessimistic 
its a leap of faith to say those economic conditions will 
hold says everett m ehrlich chief economist for the unisys 
corp and former assistant director of the congressional budget 
office 
because those economic assumptions seem so unreal the budget 
pact is an extremely elaborate smoke screen behind which congress 
and the president can hide claiming theyre making progress on the 
deficit says donald f kettl a university of virginia political 
science professor who studies the federal budget process 
then there is the enormous scope of the job ahead the accord 
must be translated into a budget resolution passed by congress and 
then more than a dozen separate bills will be fashioned to 
implement the spending and taxing choices it enunciates in many 
cases lawmakers will have to make decisions the bargainers left 
unaddressed 
the plans authors defended it as the best they could come up 
with considering their differences bush has a no new taxes 
campaign pledge to uphold while democrats want to preserve 
domestic programs 
a half a loaf is far better than the starvation diet of 
automatic spending slashes under the grammrudman law said senate 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
but not everyone was as sanguine 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas was so 
disappointed in the final product that he refused to appear at the 
white house when the deal was announced bentsen spokesman jack 
devore said the senator thought the pact was marginal enacting 
tax legislation without his support would be difficult 
the government would raise 57 billion from selling some of its 
assets that can raise quick money but it also can end up losing 
potential income in the long run if loan portfolios are sold off 
if a family is spending more than it takes in and is gathered 
around the kitchen table to decide what to do the thing we dont 
want them to do is sell the table says ehrlich 
the budget agreement picks up 53 billion in unspecified taxes 
even though bush and congressional democrats have been at each 
others throats over how that can be achieved about 13 billion 
in savings would come from shifting some payments to farmers 
planned for 1990 into this year 
another 18 billion in savings would come simply by no longer 
counting the postal services losses in the budget and 11 
billion would be saved in lower interest payments on the national 
debt now totalling about 180 billion annually as a result of 
the savings in the rest of the plan the parties claim 
it appears this will barely gasp itself across the finish line 
of meeting the extended grammrudman target said attorney jim 
jones a former house budget committee chairman referring to the 
10 billion cushion the law allows over the 100 billion deficit 
target 
and on the horizon lies work on the fiscal 1991 budget which by 
law must contain a deficit of no more than 64 billion should 
fridays plan fail to generate the savings it claims reaching the 
1991 goal will drift further and further out of reach

jacqueline kennedy in telephone conversation 
with marilyn monroe offered to divorce president kennedy if the 
actress agreed to marry him and move into the white house says a 
new biography of the former first lady 
the book also says the president once sneaked away for a sexual 
liaison without telling the secret service or taking the list of 
codes he needed in the event of a nuclear attack 
the book by c david heymann a woman named jackie will be 
serialized beginning monday in the weekly star a supermarket 
tabloid 
the star reports in its april 18 edition that later excerpts 
will include disclosures about amphetamine use by the kennedys in 
the white house 
heymann also author of poor little rich girl the life and 
legend of barbara hutton said that he obtained secret service 
fbi and cia files through the freedom of information act and that 
he and his researchers conducted 825 interviews he also had access 
to mrs kennedys white house social files 
miss monroe who has been romantically linked with the 
president told kennedys brotherinlaw peter lawford that she had 
called mrs kennedy at the white house according to the first part 
of the series 
according to marilyn jackie wasnt shaken by the call not 
outwardly she agreed to step aside she would divorce jack and 
marilyn could marry him but she would have to move into the white 
house if marilyn wasnt prepared to live openly in the white 
house she might as well forget about it lawford was quoted as 
saying 
actually jackie was infuriated by the call and for some 
reason blamed frank sinatra for it she couldnt easily blame me 
because i was family so she took it out on him sinatra was no 
longer welcome at the white house or in any of the other kennedy 
bastions said lawford who since has died 
mrs onassis spokeswoman nancy tuckerman said friday that 
mrs onassis had no comment 
the charges about kennedy sneaking away from the secret service 
were made by langdon marvin jr a former defense consultant to 
kennedy 
the book said marvin and kennedy sneaked out of the hotel 
carlyle in new york to attend a party at a townhouse across the 
street the book says 
within minutes jack had made his choice of partner and gone 
off with her to her apartment moments later the secret service 
arrived where was the president nobody knew the agent paled 
on the street in front of the townhouse stood an army 
lieutenant with an attache case handcuffed to his wrist jack was 
off making love and the bagman with the black satchel had been 
left behind 
the russians could have bombed us to hell and back and there 
would have been nothing we could have done about it marvin was 
quoted as saying 
the date of the alleged incident was not given marvin died in 
1987 according to sandra bodner a spokeswoman for the publisher 
lyle stuart 
we are not aware of any material that would support that 
allegation said frank rigg a spokesman for the john f kennedy 
library in boston 
kennedy also had illicit sexual liaisons on the night of his 
inauguration and before the nixon debates the book said

a roman catholic bishop told 
mourners at the funeral of a slain priest saturday that the 
military is persecuting the church and president corazon aquino is 
ignoring its abuses 
the rev antonio tobias bishop of pagadian diocese made the 
charge during the funeral of rev dionisio malalay he was gunned 
down april 6 in the nearby mindanao island town of tabina along 
with rufino rivera a town councilman 
police say they were slain by a soldier and an anticommunist 
militiaman both of whom were drunk 
priests say the killings illustrate the abuses suffered by 
civilians at the hands of an unruly military military officials 
say the two victims were killed during an argument and that the 
case had nothing to do with politics 
the military faces insurgencies by both communist and moslem 
guerrillas on mindanao island in december amnesty international 
reported a pattern of torture and human rights violations by 
military and paramilitary units as part of their campaign against 
communist rebels 
tobias said nine priests and lay workers have been slain in the 
philippines since 1987 he said church officials in this 
predominately roman catholic country have suffered harassment and 
intimidation through propaganda lies and threats to their very 
lives 
he claimed the military had branded human rights activists 
priests and social workers as communists on flimsy evidence such 
people can be summarily executed by military forces he said 
it becomes relatively clear why we consider ourselves to be 
living in a period of church persecution in the philippines he 
said during the services in this mindanao island community 470 
miles south of manila 
constable 2nd class sabino colipano a member of the 462nd 
philippine constabulary company and his cousin nelson colipano a 
member of a local civilian militia unit have been arrested in the 
killings the charges were brought at the urging of local church 
officials 
the bishop said he would write mrs aquino a catholic urging 
her to order an investigation 
while president aquino is being made more and more aware of 
the terrible human rights record of her government she does not 
seem to fully accept the reality the bishop said

a british religious activist said saturday that 
soviet customs officials have impounded a printing press that he 
attempted to bring into the soviet union for an unofficial 
christian publication 
the rev dick rodgers of birmingham england said the small 
offset press that he brought to the soviet union on friday was 
being held at moscows sheremetyevo airport pending a decision by 
the ministry of internal affairs 
the importation of the press for former political prisoner 
alexander ogorodnikovs bulletin of christian opinion would help in 
the publishing of private journals that have sprung up in the freer 
atmosphere fostered by president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
three former political prisoners ogorodnikov lev timofeyev 
and sergei grigoryants used carbon paper and manual typewriters 
when they started publishing two years ago they have since 
imported microcomputers and have gained access to tightly 
controlled photocopy machines 
timofeyev publishes the journal referendum and grigoryants 
publishes glasnost dozens of others publish smaller and more 
limited journals 
officials refuse to recognize their publishing activities and 
the private publishers have no access to staterun printing 
facilities 
i think it is vitally important that people should be free to 
publish religious literature rodgers said in a telephone 
interview from ogorodnikovs editorial office if there is no 
freedom to do that then any freedom is very partial 
he said he decided to try to import the press which can produce 
several thousand printed sheets per hour to test soviet compliance 
with agreements signed in vienna earlier this year on security and 
cooperation in europe 
rodgers quoted the documents as saying the agreement allows 
individuals institutions and organizations while respecting 
intellecutal property rights including copyright to obtain 
possess reproduce and distribute information material of all 
kinds 
he said soviet customs officials took custody of it and said 
they would hold onto it until they received permission to release 
it from the internal affairs ministry rodgers said 
rodgers said he planned to press soviet officials in moscow this 
week for release of the press

afghan soldiers jets and helicopter 
gunships battled moslem insurgents on saturday one day after the 
anniversary of an accord aimed at bringing peace the government 
said at least 48 people were killed 
president najib accused the us and pakistanbacked 
guerrillas who have been fighting the prosoviet government for a 
decade of stepping up attacks since the geneva accords were signed 
in 1988 
intense fighting broke out along the salang highway a key 
supply route running north to the soviet border from kabul 
dozens of jet fighters and helicopter gunships were seen flying 
toward the surrounding mountains and tanks and other military 
vehicles raced northward 
government soldiers at a checkpoint about 10 miles north of 
kabul said guerrillas hit an armored personnel carrier they did 
not know whether anyone was killed 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said fighting 
near kabul killed 43 guerrillas three government soldiers and two 
civilians he said 19 civilians were injured 
guerrillas have fired 12 rockets into the city of 225 million 
people since friday amani said 
fierce fighting also was reported in the southern garrison town 
of khost he said but there were no casualties 
his statements could not be independently verified 
the guerrillas had cut off the salang highway more than a week 
ago but a convoy of about 100 trucks broke through the blockade 
friday and brought food and fuel to the capital 
also friday government forces dislodged guerrilla forces who 
had blocked another supply route leading to the eastern city of 
jalalabad which has been under guerrillas siege since march 6 
najib in a 45minute speech to members of the cabinet 
politburo central committee religious leaders and diplomats 
accused pakistan and the united states of violating the geneva 
accords and said one result could be regional conflict 
the unmediated agrement was signed april 14 1988 by pakistan 
and afghanistan with the united states and the soviet union acting 
as guarantors the accords cleared the way for the final pullout of 
soviet troops on feb 15 and called on pakistan and afghanistan to 
stay out of each others internal affairs 
the guerrillas were not part of the negotiations and vowed to 
keep fighting to overthrow najibs government 
today precisely two months have elapsed since the complete 
withdrawal of the soviet forces from afghanistan but the war 
intervention and armed aggression are continuing with an intensity 
unprecedented during the past 10 years said the 43yearold 
leader 
afghanistan has repeatedly accused pakistan of armed 
interference and violating the unmediated accords 
the un good office mission to afghanistan and pakistan set up 
to investigate the claims has acknowledged violations but declined 
to say by which country 
najib said his government had pursued a humane and islamic 
policy of national reconcilation declaring unilateral 
ceasefires and presenting proposals for dividing and sharing state 
power 
they stubbornly rejected any kind of political settlement 
he said 
during the past year najib said guerrillas fired 432730 
rockets cannons and other weapons on afghan cities killing 2222 
civilians and wounding 13776 
he said 35927 guerrillas had been killed and another 17547 
guerrillas wounded he gave no estimate of how many solders had 
been killed or wounded 
he also said the fighting had destroyed more than 400 million 
worth of property 
we could have avoided these losses our conscience is clean 
najib said the responsibilty should lie on the shoulders of 
those who are making use of the war as a means of living and 
ensuring personal interests their hands are soaked in the blood of 
innocent people

a jury on saturday ended a mafia trial of 
121 people by convicting six men of murder but acquitting a 
defendant identified as the former leader of sicilys most powerful 
mob family 
the jury also convicted 33 other people and acquitted 81 others 
it was palermos third mass trial involving the mafia the first 
and largest of the socalled maxi trials ended in 1987 with 
convictions of 338 of the 456 defendants 
one of those acquitted saturday was michele the pope greco 
who is already serving time on another conviction and has been 
identified by prosecutors as the former head of the corleone 
family the group is considered as the most powerful mafia clan on 
the island 
saturdays acquittals suggested that the jury which included 
the judge did not accept prosecutors allegations that six murders 
in question were ordered by a cupola or executive commission 
of the mafia prosecutors said greco led that group 
the charges were based in large part on testimony from a top 
mafiosoturnedinformer tommaso buscetta his accounts helped 
convict greco and other leading mafia figures in earlier trials 
the new convictions came after 10 days of deliberation in the 
nearly yearlong trial at palermos criminal court the six men were 
sentenced to life in prison

slaying of gen carlo alberto dalla chiesa he was gunned down with 
his wife and bodyguard three months after he was sent to sicily to 
lead the nations fight against the mafia 
greco is serving a life sentence since his conviction in the 
first trial for ordering the generals assassination 
the trial that ended saturday covered other murders including 
that of a local politician shot to death with a companion outside 
palermo in 1982 
investigators say greco has now been replaced by salvatore riina 
as leader of the corleone family 
riina and his top lieutenant bernardo provenzano both 
fugitives for decades were tried in absentia in the latest trial

the ethics case against house speaker jim 
wright moves from behind closed doors into an open and far more 
political arena this week as the committee investigating him 
releases its final report and the texas democrat begins to return 
fire 
the house committee on standards of official conduct better 
known as the ethics committee is scheduled to make public on 
monday the voluminous report on its 10month inquiry along with a 
formal charge that the speaker violated house rules in several 
dozen instances 
the report is expected to present in a detailed prosecutorial 
style evidence that led the panel to believe wright improperly took 
some 100000 in gifts from a fort worth business associate who had 
a direct interest in legislation before congress and skirted 
limits on outside income by encouraging bulk sales of a book he 
wrote 
wright has asked that he be allowed to appear before the 
committee quickly perhaps within the week to begin his defense 
he is relying on committee rules that require a relatively low 
threshold of evidence to formally accuse a member of congress but 
a much higher level to conclude guilt 
on one level the case then moves into a judiciallike process 
that could lead to a trial or sorts with the ethics panel sitting 
as the jury 
but the battle will be fought on the public stage as well with 
wright arguing his innocence before colleagues and on television 
wrights primary constituency as speaker the 260 members of the 
house democratic caucus are split between those who seem to relish 
the certain political warfare to come and those who believe the 
battle is already lost and wish the speaker would bow out and save 
them the agony 
i dont think wright should stay as speaker rep george 
brown dcalif told the pressenterprise of riverside calif the 
speakers actions set a poor example for a leadership figure he 
said adding that resignation would reduce the vulnerability of 
the democratic party on grounds of ethics violations 
wright was in an upbeat and relaxed mood as he stood in the 
sunshine outside the capitol and spoke to a colleague on friday 
declaring himself relieved after an emotional televised speech he 
delivered in his own defense a day earlier 
but the political storm clouds were building 
we havent hit bottom yet said one member of the speakers 
defense team fellow texas rep charles wilson wilson referred to 
the spate of news reports certain to be spurred by release of the 
committees report this week 
even wrights defenders acknowledge that whatever the 
technical outcome of the ethics process the court of public 
opinion is likely to judge him harshly because that public forum 
allows little distinction between allegation and final disposition 
the atmosphere is just terrible said rep david obey 
dwis we are supposed to be maintaining a neutral view so we can 
judge the evidence and act as a jury all the partisan pressures 
and other pressures are making that very difficult members are 
asking themselves what are the political consequences of this 
that is not a legitimate question 
legislators who ventured to voice concern about the speakers 
ethics problems were under pressures of their own 
fellow democrats came down hard on rep robert mrazek dny 
after he told the new york times that wright was unlikely to 
survive the battle and added for the first time a couple of 
texans have said to me they think its all over a chastened 
mrazek declined to talk about the comments a day later 
and reps chet atkins of massachusetts and bernard dwyer of new 
jersey the two ethics committee democrats who voted against wright 
on the most serious count against him were said to be under severe 
pressure from colleagues in their party 
wrights main defense will be that the business partner who was 
the source of the benefits the ethics panel deems to have been 
improper gifts had no direct interest in legislative business 
before congress and never sought to lobby him those benefits paid 
by george mallick included free use of a condominium and car and 
an 18000ayear salary paid to wrights wife betty 
a more emotional issue for wright and perhaps an even more 
potent argument with colleagues will be that congress has no 
business judging the propriety of his wifes employment 
many lawmakers have spouses who work either in direct lobbying 
jobs or in positions where they have clear interests in 
legislation raising the possibility those members would be 
reluctant to cast stones 
another aspect of wrights defense appears to be that he is the 
victim of changing ethical standards in washington the rules of 
the house may need changes he said last week if so we should 
make those changes and apply them prospectively not 
retroactively 
rep louis stokes dohio a former ethics committee chairman 
said most members do not get an adequate grounding in the rules 
they are supposed to live under but he said the rules themselves 
are growing more stringent as well 
i think right now there is a sense of the necessity to ensure 
higher standards in all three branches of government stokes 
said we have been approaching this newer and tougher standard 
for some time now

the crush that killed at least 93 people at a 
sheffield stadium saturday was britains worst sports disaster and 
the latest in a catalogue of calamities that have hit the worlds 
most popular spectator sport 
the biggest loss of life at a soccer game occurred may 24 1964 
when rioting left nearly 300 dead and 500 injured after argentina 
beat peru on a lastminute goal in lima 
just over a year ago on march 12 1988 at least 93 people died 
when fans fleeing a hailstorm stampeded into locked stadium exits 
in katmandu nepal more than 100 were injured 
in 1969 soccer even caused a military conflict when el salvador 
and honduras suffered thousands of casualties in the socalled 
soccer war which began after a disputed soccer game between 
the two nations 
the worst singleincident sports disaster anywhere in the world 
in recent history occurred when an estimated 604 people were killed 
after stands at the hong kong jockey club racetrack collapsed and 
caught fire in february 1918 
but soccer the sport watched by millions of spectators from 
scandinavia to south america has born the brunt of most sports 
disasters 
on march 10 1987 as many as 20 people were killed when panicky 
soccer fans in tripoli libya fled knifewielding ruffians and 
triggered the collapse of a wall 
before saturdays shocking scenes at hillsborough stadium in 
sheffield britains worst sports disaster was at ibrox stadium in 
glasgow in jan 2 1971 when 66 soccer fans died and 170 were 
injured after barriers collapsed 
fire caused another disaster may 11 1985 when 56 people were 
killed at bradford in northern england fire ignited by a 
cigarette stub sparked a fire in the stadiums wooden terracing 
that was the worst year in the history of soccers tarnished 
image 
eighteen days later on may 29 1985 39 people most of them 
italians were killed in a stampede by liverpool fans at the 
european champions cup final at the heysel stadium in brussels 
as a result english soccer clubs were banned indefinitely by 
the union of european football associations europes governing 
body last week uefa announced it would lift the ban for the 
199091 season pending a review next april 
saturdays disaster again involved liverpool backers but this 
time overcrowding rather than riots appeared to be the cause

the remains of englands monasteries those 
bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang symbolize 
wounds too deep for healing even after 450 years 
anglican and roman catholic leaders have abandoned plans for a 
commemorative service at whitby the yorkshire port where rome 
asserted authority over the english church 13 centuries ago 
because of fears on the catholic side that the event was something 
of a celebration 
we hit a seam of sensitivity which was deeper than any of us 
realized and probably deeper than even the roman catholics knew 
said the rev ben hopkinson the anglican rector of whitby in 
the end they could not cope with it 
hopkinsons announcement on friday marked the end of two years 
of planning for a weeklong religious festival beginning june 25 
including a commemorative service which was to be held on june 29 
in the abbey ruins with princess anne attending 
the anglican bishop of whitby the right rev gordon bates said 
he was saddened by the decision it is very difficult to have a 
service of penitence and reconciliation if the catholics are not 
prepared to be involved he said 
the right rev augustine harris the roman catholic bishop of 
middleborough had nothing to add to the announcement his office 
said 
there should be no blame attributed because the differences 
were on both sides hopkinson said progress towards true 
reconciliation must continue and not be diverted because of one 
setback 
but what this has done has illustrated very clearly that while 
we have thought we were communicating with one another we were 
really still speaking different languages hopkinson said 
we dont see it as something to celebrate said the rev 
aj stacpoole senior tutor at st benets hall at oxford 
university the hall is associated with the benedictine abbey of 
ampleforth in yorkshire 
if you regard the reformation in england as an act of state 
as the historian maurice powicke called it in line one of his book 
there was nothing noble about the destruction of the monasteries 
assetstripping is what it was all about stacpoole said saturday 
the martyr tradition of 200 years began at that very moment 
starting at the london charterhouse where 18 monks went under 
along with chancellor thomas more and cardinal thomas fisher 
stacpoole said 
fisher who was the confessor to henrys first wife catherine of 
aragon and more refused to take the oath demanded by the act of 
succession affirming the kings supremacy over the church 
whitby at the mouth of the river esk on the yorkshire coast 
was the scene of a decisive moment in the history of the english 
church in 664 a council convened at whitby settled the date on 
which easter was celebrated in britain the question was far from 
trivial for it represented the triumph of rome over the practices 
and the calendar of the celtic christian church 
whitby was sacked by danish raiders in 867 and was refounded as 
a benedictine house in 1078 
henry viii split with roman catholicism in 1533 suppressed the 
smaller monasteries three years later and turned against the great 
monasteries including whitby in 1539 
whitby abbey had fallen into ruins by the early 19th century 
and much of what was left was shelled by the german fleet in 1914 
of the church built in 1222 only the front wall and the two 
transepts are still standing nothing remains of the other monastic 
buildings 
such holy ruins inspired william shakespeare to write of bare 
ruined choirs the choir being the rear portion of the church 
where monastic services were held 
and it was from his vantage point above the ruins of tintern 
abbey in southwestern england that william wordsworth heard the 
still sad music of humanity and rejoiced in that blessed mood 
in which the burthen of the mystery in which the heavy and the 
weary weight of all this unintelligible world is lightened

about 3000 women gathered saturday to 
discuss the rehabilitation of survivors of the 1984 bhopal gas 
disaster and protest a legal settlement of damages decreed by 
indias supreme court 
the twoday convention was organized by the bhopal women gas 
victims organization which says the 470 million settlement 
decreed by indias highest court is too little 
the government says more than 3400 people died and at least 
20000 were injured when methyl isocyanate gas escaped from a tank 
at the bhopal pesticide plant operated by an indian subisidary of 
union carbide corp a danbury connbased multinational 
this convention is the first step to start a mass movement in 
the country to fight for the rights of the gas victims said 
abdul jabbar khan an activist who heads the womens group 
he predicted the convention would pass resolutions demanding a 
review of the settlement and the reopening of the governments 3 
billion suit against union carbide 
on feb 14 the high court ordered union carbide to pay 470 
million to settle all claims 
at the conventions opening session dr sathyamala of the 
medico friends circle disputed the governments casualty toll for 
the disaster she said statistics collected from burial and 
cremation grounds indicated at least 20000 people died from 
exposure to the gas that seeped out of the pesticide plant on dec 
3 1984 
similar claims have been made before given the haste with which 
hindu victims were cremated and moslem victims were buried in 
keeping with the tenets of their faiths the precise number of 
deaths may never be known 
dr sathyamala who uses only one name also said bhopals birth 
rate had fallen because people who were exposed to the gas had 
conception and sterility problems 
the number of births has come down every year from 12000 
before the tragedy to just 7800 now she said

romanian president nicolae ceausescu has 
acknowleged publicly his country has the potential to make nuclear 
weapons according to media reports saturday 
ceausescu also said romania would ban new hard currency 
borrowings now that it has repaid its 21 billion foreign debt 
according to the state news agency agerpres monitored in vienna 
we can produce any equipment and machinery let us be 
competitive with the best products turned out in the world 
agerpres quoted him as saying 
in only one domain we do not want to do it that of nuclear 
weapons technically we have this ability as well but we are 
firmly resolved to fight against nuclear weapons ceausescu 
reportedly told the socialist democracy and unity front a 
communistled organization 
the statement followed unconfirmed reports that ceausescu 
mentioned romanias nuclear capability to hungarian communist party 
leader karoly grosz at an august meeting in the romanian town of 
arad 
the agerpres report gave no further details of the statement on 
nuclear weapons by ceausescu who has ruled his country since 1965 
in a separate speech friday concluding the threeday communist 
party central committee session ceausescu said he will submit to 
parliament a law that nobody should be allowed in any form to 
resort to any foreign credit 
such a law would put romania on par with albania the only other 
european nation whose laws forbid borrowing from the west 
when he opened the session wednesday ceausescu announced 
romania had paid off its foreign debt with western creditors 
excerpts of the speech reported by agerpres showed ceausescu 
firmly rejecting sovietstyle reforms of communism and announcing 
plans to revise current romanian editions of works by karl marx 
friedrich engels and soviet founder vladimir i lenin 
the yugoslav news agency tanjug reporting on the central 
committee meeting from bucharest said it reaffirmed controversial 
plans to destroy villages in romania and also rejected recent 
western criticism of human rights abuses in romania 
ceausescu said last year that 7000 villages might be destroyed 
in a scheme to create large agroindustrial complexes in the 
countryside once the backbone of romanias agriculturebased 
economy 
severe food shortages have developed in recent years as the 
emphasis has switched to industry and agricultural produce was 
exported to the soviet bloc in exchange for raw materials and to 
the west for hard currency 
the hard currency was needed to pay off romanias debt

a repaired concorde jet roared away from 
australia on saturday to attempt a supersonic speed record leaving 
investigators baffled about why part of its tail tore off over the 
ocean last week 
there are no signs of metal fatigue said british airways 
airport services manager pat boody engineers have crawled all 
over it replaced the tail assembly and we still dont know why it 
happened 
on wednesday the british airways plane lost a fourbythree 
foot chunk of its tail over the south pacific while setting a speed 
record from christchurch new zealand though the 100 american 
passengers aboard felt a shudder the crew served lunch and the 
plane landed safely in sydney with no injuries reported 
it was traveling about 1500 mph at the time nearly twice the 
speed of sound 
capt david leney the pilot said earlier in the week he was 
puzzled why the concorde lost part of its tail 
we were climbing at 44000 feet when there was a slight 
bump leney said i didnt know at the time we had lost part of 
the rudder i thought we must have hit something but how can that 
be at 44000 feet theres nothing there to hit us 
despite the incident the passengers many of whom are wealthy 
seemed to have few worries about reboarding the in sydney earlier 
saturday for the flight to perth in western australia it made a 
onehour refueling stop and continued on to colombo sri lanka 
the plane is on a threeweek odyssey that started april 1 in 
london it is trying to establish supersonic speed records on each 
of 12 legs of its aroundtheworld journey that ends in london on 
april 23 
the concorde which also performs regular commercial service 
has been used mainly on transatlantic routes 
boody said a sevenmember repair team flew in from london and 
worked around the clock so the jet could leave only one day behind 
schedule for perth and sri lanka 
the concorde completed the sydneyperth trip a distance of 
about 2050 miles in two hours 40 minutes and 5 seconds it 
reached a maximum speed of 1300 mph 
you would be a fool to miss this said passenger tony 
misciagna an investments broker from altoona pa like others on 
the trip he paid 39000 for the 38215mile journey 
were going to places we wouldnt normally go because it 
usually takes so long he said its got to be the best bargain 
in town im going to go again next year even if its costs more

president hosni mubarak on saturday removed 
defense minister abdelhalim abughazala who was viewed as the 
governments no 2 man and named him to a largely ceremonial post 
the government described the transfer of abughazala to the 
assistant presidency as a promotion but diplomats said it was a 
demotion they said it underscored mubaraks control of the 
government 
the post of assistant president now vacant has been largely 
ceremonial 
abughazala helped develop egypts strong ties with the united 
states the development took us officials here by surprise but 
one western diplomat said it should not hurt usegyptian 
relations 
i understand theyre in a frenzy he said of us officials 
but i wouldnt have thought that the passing of abughazala 
should necessarily worry the americans 
hes very proamerican but there are a lot of people like 
that in the egyptian forces the diplomat said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the countrys political system is closer to democracy than that 
of almost any other arab state but it maintains equilibrium 
through the use of police and military force many people have 
assumed mubarak relied on the army and generals like abughazala as 
a prop for his authority 
i suppose the main significance is that mubarak felt strong 
enough to do it he very clearly must have had the backing of the 
armed forces the diplomat said 
the us embassy staff had no immediate reaction 
the ambassador added that he had long heard rumors that mubarak 
was unhappy with abughazalas personal and professional ethical 
standards 
but abughazala a 59yearold with five children is reported 
to have taken a second wife less than half the age of his first 
after a public courtship that scandalized some eygptians according 
to government and diplomatic sources moslems may take up to four 
wives 
in addition westerners who do business with the defense 
ministry also speak of significant corruption 
the last assistant president was former prime minister mamdouh 
salem he died three years ago and the position has been vacant 
since then 
the post is separate from the vice presidency which is also 
vacant the country has had no vice president since mubarak 
succeeded assassinated president anwar sadat in october 1981 
mubarak served as vice president to sadat from 1975 until the 
assassination 
in the last few years there have been frequent reports and 
speculation that mubarak would promote abughazala to vice 
president abughazala denied the reports 
the defense ministry which abughazala headed for eight years 
will now be operated by maj gen youssef sabry abutaleb 60 who 
ran cairos government for six years as governor 
mubarak announced the two appointments in decrees and 
immediately swore in the two men to their new posts saturday 
afterward prime minister atef sedki told reporters only that 
mubarak needs at his side someone to help him in the huge tasks 
that he has to discharge 
however government sources pointed out that abutaleb not 
abughazala accompanied mubarak on a trip to jordan on wednesday 
to discuss with king hussein his upcoming us trip the sources 
said abughazala was removed from the delegation at the last minute 
abughazala 59 served as military attache in washington 
between 1976 and 1979 he was regarded as a prime player in forging 
cairos special relationship with the united states after egypt 
signed a peace treaty with israel in 1979 
he was graduated from cairos military academy in 1949 but he 
later attended military courses both in the soviet union and the 
united states he was an officer in egypts 1956 1967 and 1973 
wars with israel 
the middle east news agency said mahmoud sherif governor of 
sharkia province would take over as governor of cairo

a bizarre sect of suspected drug 
smugglers was influenced by a cult movie called the believers 
about the time they began performing human sacrifices to protect 
their illegal business police said saturday 
the 1986 movie starring martin sheen and directed by john 
schlesinger is about rich influential families who protect their 
prominence with rites including human sacrifice 
the motives of the movies characters are chillingly similar to 
those of the members of the reallife cult accused of sacrificing 
at least 13 people on a ranch west of matamoros mexico police 
said 
they keep bringing the movie up cameron county sheriffs 
lt george gavito said after interviewing two suspects they talk 
about it like that had something to do with changing them 
the 13 bodies were found this week on a ranch 20 miles west of 
matamoros across the rio grande from brownsville police said most 
of the cults victims died either from blows dealt with a machete 
or a hammer 
some suffered horrible mutilations including the removal of 
brains hearts and other organs that were boiled with blood in what 
suspects have described as sacrificial rites of a cult seeking 
magical protection for their drugsmuggling activities 
authorities said the gang smuggled a ton of marijuana a week 
into the united states 
four suspects are in custody all in matamoros four others 
including a man and woman whom sect members called the 
godfather and the godmother are at large 
us federal authorities videotaped interviews friday with two 
of the suspects in custody in matamoros said oran neck agent in 
charge of us customs in brownsville 
serafin hernandez garcia and elio hernandez rivera told the us 
officials the cults godmother sara maria aldrete recruited 
them into the group early 1988 neck said 
ms aldrete 24 and the cults cubanborn leader adolfo de 
jesus constanzo 26 at first practiced a widespread afrocuban 
religion called santeria or the way of the saints the 
suspects told authorities santeria assigns roman catholic saints 
with the characteristics of west african deities like many 
religions originating among poor farming people santeria 
sometimes calls for the sacrifice of animals but never humans 
but the groups relatively benign rites turned sinister late 
last summer about the time ms aldrete began urging members to 
watch videotapes of the believers gavito said 
the movie did not in itself incite group members to perform 
human sacrifice gavito said but it reinforced their desire to 
begin killing people to provide a magical shield for their alleged 
drug activities

hu yaobang an outspoken reformer who led the 
worlds largest communist party until a 1987 purge consigned him to 
political oblivion died of heart failure saturday he was 73 
the protege of senior leader deng xiaoping died one week after 
he suffered a heart attack during a meeting of the politburo the 
ruling body that dismissed him as party general secretary two years 
before 
at beijing university hundreds of students put up posters 
praising hu as a reformer and indirectly criticizing those who 
ousted him 
the chinese communist party he led for seven years described hu 
as a great proletarian revolutionary and loyal communist 
fighter who led a glorious life with everlasting merits for the 
party and the people 
but hu suffered from his partys swift ideological shifts 
he joined mao tsetung on the 193435 long march but was 
targeted by maos red guards during the 196676 cultural 
revolution spending nearly the entire decade banished to the 
countryside or under house arrest 
hus political fortunes rose after maos death and he helped 
revive chinas economy through marketoriented reforms he once 
stood on the threshold of succeeding deng xiaoping as the leader of 
chinas 11 billion people but he fell from grace over 1986 
prodemocracy student demonstrations 
he was forced to resign on jan 16 1987 after being blamed for 
failing to put down the demonstrations hu who had reportedly 
alienated deng with his outspoken manner also was accused of 
promoting dangerously high growth rates and neglecting to stop the 
trend toward westernization 
hu retained his seat on the powerful 17member politburo but he 
made no public statements and appeared ill at ease in his few 
public appearances 
he was last seen during the annual session of chinas 
parliament the national peoples congress which ended april 4 
at beijing university saturday hundreds of students milled 
around posters praising hu as a leading force in reform one 
poster referred obliquely to hus 1987 ouster as that year when 
you were made to play the scapegoat 
may your spirit reawaken to bear witness to history 
another poster said in an apparent call for a review of the 
charges against him 
the evening television news briefly played mournful music while 
displaying a picture of hu then read a communist party statement 
that praised hu as a statesman and great proletarian 
revolutionary 
the statement did not mention hus ouster in disgrace 
the chainsmoking hu dengs longtime bridge partner was widely 
expected to take over dengs functions when chinas senior leader 
now 84 stepped down 
the unofficial scenario called for hu once he overcame the 
suspicions of the conservative military to take over dengs posts 
and become the nations undisputed leader instead former premier 
zhao ziyang succeeded hu as party boss and li peng who favors 
economic stability over reform initiatives became premier 
hu was born in november 1915 in liuyang county hunan province 
according to official reports he left home at the age of 14 to 
join the communist party childrens corps 
he took part in the long march the red armys epic flight from 
chiang kaisheks nationalist forces and served as a political 
commissar during the 193745 war against japan 
hu became secretary of the communist youth league in 1952 three 
years after maos forces took over the mainland and in 1956 he was 
appointed to the party central committee 
in 1966 as head of the youth league he became a prime target 
of maos cultural revolution red guards shaved his head forced 
him to crawl on his hands and knees and exiled him to rural henan 
province 
among his alleged crimes was that he and deng another victim of 
the leftists used railroad cars and special airplanes to ferry 
bridge partners around the country 
hu was rehabilitated in 1977 and headed the party office in 
charge of redressing injustice during the cultural revolution 
he quickly rankled party ideologues men who would later push 
for his ouster by criticizing mao for his role in the cultural 
revolution which he described as a period of catastrophe in 
which nothing was correct or positive 
he was elected secretary general of the party central committee 
in 1980 and served as chairman of the party from june 1981 until 
the title was abolished in september 1982 he then became general 
secretary of the party 
hu had four children and five grandchildren his wife li zhao is 
a clothing designer and former official in the beijing textile 
bureau

libya on saturday denounced the united states and 
secretary of state james a baker iii for criticizing libyas 
acquisition of soviet fighterbombers 
an article by the political editor of libyas official jana news 
agency said 
if baker deplores the possession by jamahiriya libya of some 
equipment it needs to exercise its selfdefense how does he 
justify his governments supply of a very advanced arsenal of 
military equipment to the zionist enemy israel used in attacking 
the palestinian arab people and disturbing the stability of the 
whole region 
it said libya has reasserted its clear stance rejecting all 
forms and types of terrorism and world public opinion no 
longer believes such fabricated accusations promoted by hostile 
forces either through their statements or leaked reports the 
report was monitored in rome 
us officials have said the soviets supplied libya with up to 
15 sukhoi fighterbombers capable of threatening egypt and possibly 
israel 
but soviet officials said no more than six such planes were sent 
to libya and they are defensive aircraft 
the jana article made no mention of us air raids three years 
ago on the libyan cities of tripoili and benghazi the reagan 
administration said the bombings on april 15 1986 were carried out 
because libya supports international terrorism

before the soldiers began to forcibly clear out demonstrators 
georgian officials have said they did not expect fatalities when 
they ordered an end to the rallies in downtown tbilisi

hungarys leading communist reformers 
met saturday for an unprecedented debate on the future of the 
governing communist party and a possible split 
the meeting came three days after the communist party shuffled 
the leadership of its ruling politburo 
imre pozsgay one of the most prominent reformers told some 600 
people at the meeting that a split in the party would mean its 
demise but others said the party might be ineffective without a 
drastic change 
there had been speculation before wednesdays shakeup in the 
politburo that the reformers might break with the party 
pozsgay said a multiparty system is unavoidable and the 
communist party must take the lead in solving social and economic 
problems if it wants to compete 
lets endeavor to account for our deeds before we are called 
to account he said 
according to published reports many of the thousands of people 
who have left the party in the past year were dissatisfied with the 
slow pace of reforms 
reszo nyers a reformer and a politburo member said sweeping 
economic changes such as the introduction of market forces are 
crucial but they could not be achieved by a single party even if 
it is a reform party 
pal vashtag a reformer who became a member of the politburo on 
wednesday told journalists that a split in the party would be 
highly unfortunate 
during the debate however some participants advocated a split 
enforced unity only paralyzes the effectiveness of the party 
which forces it to make compromises and make effective leadership 
impossible said csaba gombar a political scientist 
two speakers who received strong applause were laszlo lengyel 
and mihaly bihari both expelled from the party a year ago 
lengyel said hungarian society will simply bypass the 
party if it continues to avoid the hard decisions 
bihari said procedures for a multiparty system must be 
established as soon as possible

dozens of residents of vieques 
island camped out saturday around the house of a family ordered to 
leave land that the us navy claims is federal property 
two navy vehicles were burned friday when about 100 neighbors of 
carmelo felix matta blocked an attempt by three us marshals to 
enforce an eviction order no injuries were reported 
the navy claims felix matta an unemployed veteran living on a 
veterans administration pension and his family are unauthorized 
occupants of land within the boundaries of camp garcia located 
on vieques island 
the 32squaremile island is off the east coast of puerto rico 
lt richard boyle a spokesman for navy operations in the 
caribbean said saturday the navy has been trying to get felix 
matta and an unspecified number of other families off the land 
since 1985 
the san juan star newspaper said that when felix matta refused 
the marshals order to leave on friday the officers called for 
assistance from the navy 
eight sailors arrived in two trucks and began loading the 
vehicles with items from felix mattas house area residents then 
blocked the road and someone threw gasoline on the trucks and set 
them afire the newspaper said 
the residents returned many of the familys belongings to the 
house according to the newspaper 
a person at the scene saturday said the matta family remained in 
the house and dozens of residents were camped out at the site in 
case of another eviction attempt 
charles connelly publisher of the vieques times a monthly 
newsletter said the felix matta house is about two miles from the 
entrance to camp garcia and about 2000 feet from the fence 
surrounding the base 
he said the navy contends that although the house is outside the 
fence it is in a buffer zone established in 1985 between the fence 
and civilian property 
recently the navy began hanging signs in front of houses some 
of which are businesses saying they are on us federal 
property connelly said 
he said felix matta has been on the land since at least 1976 
twothirds of vieques island located between puerto rico and 
the us virgin islands is owned by the navy the us military 
uses a large section as a bombing and gunnery range 
there have been sporadic protests of the navy presence and 
bombing range in the early 1980s commercial fishermen defied the 
navy and entered restricted waters during military maneuvers 
about 7000 people live on vieques and many are fishermen

king hussein on saturday approved a new 
election law that cancels representation in the jordanian 
parliament for the israelioccupied west bank a government source 
said 
the action builds on husseins decision last july to renounce 
sovereignty over the west bank in favor of the palestine liberation 
organization 
jordan ruled the west bank until 1967 when israel captured the 
territory during the middle east war both israel and the united 
states have suggested jordan should play a role in the west bank as 
part of any middle east peace settlement 
the new election law came days before husseins scheduled trip 
to the united states he meets with president bush in washington on 
wednesday 
the law also promotes jordans claim to the palestinian refugees 
it has sheltered following the 1948 and 1967 civil wars by giving 
them the same voting rights as other jordanian citizens said the 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
hussein has said that palestinians on the east bank of the 
jordan river who hold jordanian citizenship have the same duties as 
other jordanians 
about half of jordans 3 million people come from palestinian 
families although most live outside the unrun refugee camps 
previous electoral laws gave camp residents parliament seats 
based on the number of camps rather than on the number of residents 
no date for new elections was set 
the source said the law calls for a 72member lower house of 
parliament the old 60member parliament was suspended in 1988

two rival theories to explain recent experiments 
in nuclear fusion have emerged from the massachusetts institute of 
technology and on them may depend the vision of a society with a 
limitless supply of energy 
one theory holds that the experiments depend primarily on a 
chemical reaction rather than a nuclear one and offer little hope 
for a clean new source of electrical power 
the other postulates that fusion is taking place and results 
from the unusual properties of the precious metal palladium and 
from subatomic behavior known as quantum tunneling if so it 
is at least theoretically possible the process could be harnessed 
for electric power 
the first theory is the work of mit professor keith h johnson 
the second comes from his colleague peter l hagelstein both men 
who have been working independently announced friday that they 
have submitted papers describing the theories to scientific 
journals 
chemists at the university of utah caused a sensation last month 
when they said they had found a way to merge or fuse the nuclei 
of hydrogen atoms at room temperature 
they said they had produced nuclear fusion in heavy water 
which contains the hydrogen isotope deuterium in a process that 
generated four times more power than it used 
nuclear fusion which fuels the sun and the stars is regarded 
by scientists as having enormous potential as a clean efficient 
energy source unlike nuclear fission which splits atoms fusion 
leaves little radioactive waste 
until the utah announcement scientists believed temperatures 
close to 100 million degrees were necessary to overcome the 
electrical forces of repulsion between atomic nuclei laboratories 
in texas and in hungary and the soviet union say they have 
duplicated the experiment georgia scientists initially announced 
they had successfully performed it then said they may have erred 
in the view of johnson a 52yearold materials science 
professor the conditions used in the utah experiment permit atoms 
of hydrogen and deuterium to be tightly bound together in the 
crystal lattice structure of the palladium 
the hydrogen and deuterium atoms form chemical bonds and begin 
vibrating at very high frequencies producing heat 
some of the nuclei occasionally get close enough together that 
they actually fuse but the large bulk of the heat that is produced 
is not associated with the fusion he said friday 
this process not being nuclear in origin means it is not a 
panacea for solving the worlds energy problems johnson said 
it will not in my opinion be useful for large scale energy 
production 
hagelstein 34 who works in mits research laboratory of 
electronics claims to be seeking a patent for an related fusion 
process as yet untested 
the dominant reaction in the utah experiment in hagelsteins 
theory is the fusion of two deuterium nuclei which produces 
helium and releases energy that is trapped within the palladium 
lattice and eventually emerges as heat 
the theory focuses on quantum tunnelling an explanation for 
how nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces that ordinarily 
keep them apart to fuse at lower energy levels than normally 
expected 
the use of this fusion energy to produce electrical energy 
with some efficiency seems likely he wrote in an abstract of 
his papers 
hagelstein theorized that the reaction is triggered by some 
outside source such as a cosmic ray some researchers may have 
been unable to duplicate the utah result because they have shielded 
their experiments with materials such as lead that would block such 
rays he said 
scientists at lawrence livermore national laboratory in 
livermore calif and at los alamos laboratory in los alamos 
nm said their initial efforts to duplicate the fusion experiment 
had not been conclusive

after months of court hearings and 
public debates uruguayans vote sunday to uphold or cancel an 
amnesty for soldiers accused of human rights violations during the 
military dictatorship 
congress passed an amnesty law in december 1986 that would apply 
to security forces but some political and human rights groups 
quickly organized to try to overturn the measure by referendum 
in late 1987 the antiamnesty groups submitted petitions with 
634000 signatures to the electoral court the court eventually 
affirmed the required minimum of 555701 signatures onefourth of 
the electorate at that time 
president julio m sanguinetti elected in november 1984 after 
democracy was restored following 12 years of military rule 
supports the amnesty law 
he said nullification of it would be a step backward in the 
process of national pacification 
parties supporting the referendum say soldiers and police 
accused of kidnappings torture and killings must be tried if 
democracy is to be fully reestablished 
the law should be annulled not only because its content is 
contrary to human rights traditionally defended in our country 
but also for the reason that it was sanctioned and promulgated 
under military threat the national commission for the referendum 
said recently 
it is estimated that 150 people were killed and more than 200 
others were arrested and disappeared during the military crackdown 
on suspected leftwing subversives that began in 1973 several 
thousand uruguayans claim they were tortured after being detained 
by security forces 
president juan m bordaberry under military pressure in 1973 
gave the armed forces a free hand to act against rebels especially 
the tupamaros guerrillas the military took control and ousted 
bordaberry in june 1976 
sanguinetti took office in march 1985 he supported an amnesty 
law passed by congress that freed political prisoners and gave jobs 
back to hundreds of public employees who had been fired by the 
military government 
that law excluded the security forces and by mid1986 about 50 
cases had been filed accusing some 180 soldiers of human rights 
abuses 
military officials made it known that they opposed the trial of 
military men in civilian courts and sanguinetti headed off a 
potential crisis by pressing for an amnesty that would include the 
military congress passed that measure on dec 22 1986 
polls open at 8 am and close at 730 pm those who favor the 
amnesty law will cast yellow ballots and those opposed will cast 
green ballots 
there are 23 million eligible voters and preliminary results 
are expected sunday night

two weeks ago elio hernandez 
ran his pickup through a police drug checkpoint near the us 
border and sped on the young man didnt worry about police 
following him he thought he was invisible 
we located the place waited a few days and then moved in 
said federal police commander juan benitez ayala 
police expected to make a large marijuana bust commonplace here 
instead they ripped the mask from a nightmarish world of black 
magic sex drug smuggling and human sacrifice 
twelve bodies were found tuesday and one more on thursday 
buried near a corral some had their hearts ripped out their 
genitals cut off or their brains removed some died of machete 
blows to the head most died blindfolded and gagged 
police said they had all been killed by smugglers who believed 
that human sacrifice would give them a magical shield that 
would protect them from the law 
among the victims were a 16yearold boy and mark kilroy 
missing since march when he came here during spring break from the 
university of texas 
hernandez david serna serafin hernandez garcia and sergio 
martinez were arrested police on saturday sought the alleged 
ringleader a cubanamerican voodoo priest adolfo de jesus 
constanzo and a witch sara aldrete 
all four defendants blamed constanzo whom they called the 
padrino for the murders they claimed they had been lured into 
the cult by miss aldretes sexual favors aldrete also lured some 
of the victims they said 
hernandez and serna told newsmen that constanzo whom they had 
known for nine months had initiated them into the occult but they 
said they did not know much about it we believed sometimes and 
sometimes we did not said hernandez 
a federal agent who asked not to be identified said the group 
was totally under the control of the cuban i dont think they 
even knew what they were getting into 
they were told that the sacrifices would protect them from 
police the agent said one of them told us that the padrino 
told him police would not see him even if they walked by him 
hernandez and hernandez garcia are texas natives born in 
mission and weslaco respectively in the rio grande valley just 
across the border aldrete a mexican citizen was a student at 
texas southmost college in brownsville 
two days after the checkpoint incident police picked up domingo 
reyes the ranch caretaker and asked him about activities at the 
100acre ranch just below the us border reyes started talking 
about strange happenings in the wooden shack near the main ranch 
house and how he was once told not to come close 
on a hunch a federal agent showed him a picture of kilroy 
i saw him at the ranch one day reyes said 
it was all the agents wanted to know us officials had been 
pressing mexican police to find the student tourism from across 
the border had diminished since kilroy vanished the case had top 
priority 
police rounded up the suspects at the ranch and found more than 
200 pounds of marijuana but that was not what made headlines 
in the shed was a copper caldron in it were the remnants of a 
fire and something that looked like brains nearby were candles and 
pots containing heads of black goats and roosters 
the four suspects led police to shallow graves where the bodies 
were buried sergio martinez who volunteered information on a 13th 
victim sweated for almost two hours digging up the body thursday 
as police ignored his pleas for water 
at miss aldretes home agents found more indications of black 
magic there was a list of names with pins next to some of them 
one agent said bloodstained childrens clothing was found 
the shack was immediately dubbed the satanic chapel by 
federal agents and local newspapers those arrested became 
satans children and the narcodevils 
each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 147 years 
a wave of horror swept over the community because of the crimes 
even though drug smuggling and violence are wellknown in this 
swashbuckling border area and smugglers exploits are the subjects 
of popular ballads 
to many in matamoros a city of nearly 500000 the slayings 
were a perversion of the traditional image of the mexican smuggler 
who helped the town sent his kids to the best schools and was 
often a heavy contributor to charity and civic causes 
people were quick to point out that the ringleader was cuban and 
that the cult bore resemblances to santeria a caribbean 
hispanic version of voodoo although anthropologists said it was 
actually a mixed bag ripping out a living persons heart for 
instance was an ancient aztec rite 
our smugglers do not pray to the devil said one resident 
ala rosa garza this witchcraft and drugs is something 
imported it is the american influence

more than 1000 antinuclear protesters 
were arrested at the nations nuclear testing grounds saturday as 
part of the annual reclaim the test site demonstration 
energy department spokesman jim boyer estimated that 1500 
people turned out saturday for the ninth day of the protest at the 
nevada test site the event ends sunday 
boyer said 1060 protesters were arrested mostly on misdemeanor 
trespass charges 
they were taken by bus to the nye county sheriffs office in 
beatty 55 miles away where they were to be released after being 
cited on the misdemeanor charge boyer said 
because of the numbers we just decided to put security 
personnel on the buses so they can write the citations while the 
buses are rolling boyer said the same ones that were arrested 
yesterday are the ones we are taking out there there today 
county officials announced earlier this month they would no 
longer prosecute the trespassers because of the growing number of 
protests and arrests at the remote desert site 
a total of 2818 arrests were reported at the site last year 
including 2065 during the 1988 reclaim the test site action 
more than 100 law officers were on hand to collect and handcuff 
the demonstrators as they walked across a cattle guard raised on 
the main road leading to the test site 
the cattle guard consisting of slats placed across the road 
has been a rallying point for protests the past eight years and 
law officers have arrested activists who crossed that point onto 
test site property 
hundreds of protesters slipped through barbed wire fences 
surrounding a section of the site then waited on the sun baked 
windswept desert for officers to arrest them 
sensitive areas of the test site where nuclear tests are 
conducted are remote and highly guarded

in the bright sunshine of early 
spring the cheers of english soccer fans turned to screams as a 
surging crowd crushed 93 spectators to death saturday 
some of the victims at the hillsborough stadium in sheffield 
were taken away on advertising billboards used as makeshift 
stretchers others lay motionless on the field while emergency 
medical teams tried desperately to save their lives 
one survivor numbed with shock sat in a corner of the stadium 
head in his hands 
all around him police gathered up clothing and belongings as 
ambulances sped across the green turf picking up bodies and taking 
the injured to hospitals 
one doctor told of sheer mayhem when he ran to help the 
dying 
there was one chap i went to who was clinically dead dr 
glyn phillips said he had no heartbeat 
phillips said he managed to resuscitate the fan but i dont 
know what the state of his cerebral function is going to be 
the disaster occurred when the 54000capacity stadium was 
almost full police said they opened the gate to admit other fans 
fearing if they didnt there might be trouble outside 
the move proved fatal inside hundreds of spectators were 
pushed against a steel mesh antiriot fence that soon collapsed 
it seemed as if it was four deep in dead bodies with people 
climbing over them said 22yearold stuart mcgeagh 
another survivor gary stanley 20 said crowd control outside 
the stadium was crazy 
there was complete madness and somehow the doors were 
opened he said there were too many people in the section and 
i saw some people crushed against barriers the arrangements were 
dreadful and ive still got a full ticket i didnt even have to 
show it to get in 
another liverpool fan who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said it was ridiculous they just opened the gates and waved 
them in i have two friends but i dont know whats happened to 
them 
i was crushed up to one of the railings and got cuts to my arm 
but i was lucky to get out alive 
as police cleared the ground fans wandered around aimlessly 
huge sections of the fence had been ripped away one section was 
bent out of shape like a pipe cleaner 
people were just crushing in one fan told yorkshire 
television there was a lad and his girlfriend and they were just 
screaming his words were please god help me and i believe the 
girl died her face was just blue

plans for a new federal prison in the 
washington dc area a major part of national drug czar william 
bennetts announced crackdown on crime in the nations capital 
have been shelved in favor of building another prison in western 
maryland officials said saturday 
it is no longer necessary that a facility be built in the 
immediate baltimorewashington area the capacity can be gained 
more quickly in other ways john walters chief of staff for 
bennetts national office of drug control policy said saturday 
bennett on monday proposed a 700bed washingtonarea prison for 
drug offenders when he unveiled plans to combat the epidemic of 
drugrelated violence in the nations capital 
the perception that initially came out was that there was 
going to be this one facility to house all drug traffickers coming 
out of the district of columbia it was a misunderstanding said 
greg bogdan public information officer for the us bureau of 
prisons 
on friday us bureau of prisons director j michael quinlan 
said 50 million had been earmarked to build a mediumsecurity 
prison and a minimumsecurity prison camp about five miles south of 
cumberland the prison complex housing at least 700 prisoners is 
slated for completion in the fall of 1991 
bennett spokesman don hamilton said saturday the cumberland 
facility essentially would replace plans for the washingtonarea 
prison as a result of the dc initiative a prison that was 
going to be built someday is going to be built in cumberland he 
said 
under the plan announced by bennett the federal bureau of 
prisons will immediately accept 250 prisoners housed in the local 
jail a 500bed pretrial detention center is to be built within a 
year and a 700bed prison was to be built in the 
washingtonbaltimore area 
additional personnel also were to be provided for drugfighting 
efforts under the plan which bennett said would cost 70 to 80 
million the 700bed prison was the most costly part of the plan at 
about 50 million

a strong earthquake jolted a remote area of 
southwestern china early sunday the state seismological bureau 
said 
it said communications were down with the area in sichuan 
province near the western border with tibet and that it had no 
reports of casualties or damage 
the bureau said the quake struck at 534 am near the town of 
batang located on the jinsha river and registered 67 on the 
richter scale 
in november a tremor measuring 76 on the richter scale 10 
times more powerful than sundays quake killed 730 people and 
injured more than 4000 in yunnan province south of sichuan it 
was chinas worst earthquake in a decade 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake 
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph a quake 
measuring 67 is capable of causing severe damage in a populated 
area each increase by one number on the scale means the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake registering 7 is considered a major tremor capable of 
widespread heavy damage

a republican gubernatorial hopeful and 
the citys democratic mayor engaged in a political shoving match 
saturday to lay blame for layoffs that cut the citys police and 
fire departments by 20 percent 
meanwhile morale is at an all time low said fire chief 
william neafsey 
most of them are confused frustrated and mad neafsey said 
of his workers you name the negative emotion they have it 
many police officers were wearing black bands around their 
badges in honor of laidoff colleagues said police director joseph 
brennan 
chuck hardwick the assembly speaker who is seeking the 
republican nomination for governor said he would convene an 
emergency task force to investigate the finances of elizabeth and 
other communities that have asked for more state money 
thomas dunn elizabeths mayor for a quartercentury has blamed 
the citys budget woes on hardwick who has blocked an assembly 
vote on a tax package that would provide 65 million more to 
distressed cities 
dunn on friday laid off 67 police officers 53 firefighters 24 
emergency medical technicians and 81 other city workers 
if new jersey were a business and the city of elizabeth one of 
its departments mayor dunn would be fired hardwich said during 
a news conference in my opinion hes acted with a callous 
disregard for public safety 
hardwick said he wanted to know why dunn had not used the 71 
million in distressedcities aid released by the state to elizabeth 
last week 
hes a trickster hes a carnival showman dunn responded 
from his office at city hall i welcome him and anybody else to 
investigate including the attorney general 
how can i spend cash that i dont have he said dunn said 
the 71 million has been promised but not paid even if i got 
it it wouldnt be enough i need 26 million more 
the city council last week transferred 21 million from the 
citys garbage disposal account to prevent the layoffs but dunn 
has said that under state law the money cannot be switched

the commander of the coast guard said 
saturday he was encouraged by exxons plan to clean up of vast 
stretches of oilstained shoreline overrun by the nations worst 
oil spill 
meanwhile the spill spread its tentacles in several directions 
forcing the closure of a herring fishery and raising fears that 
bears would be poisoned by oiltainted salmon carcasses in katmai 
national park 
despite the grim reports coast guard adm paul yost emerged 
from a meeting with exxon officials saying he was optimistic about 
the firms longawaited plan 
it appears to be a piece of work thats well thoughtout 
scientifically and operationally and im very encouraged said 
yost who has predicted the cleanup would extend through the summer 
i dont think were going to be back to 100 percent by this 
time next year but i think were going to have a much bigger smile 
on our faces than now he said 
he said he would not approve the 20page plan until he had 
examined it over the weekend and thought it likely it would take 
two or three weeks to fully implement it 
i wish it was two or three weeks ago responded dennis kelso 
commissioner of the statedepartment of environmental conservation 
kelso who had criticized exxon harshly for failing to produce the 
plan earlier also attended the meeting he said he would brief 
gov steve cowper this weekend 
exxon spokesman don cornett said the company would not discuss 
its plan until after yost had fully reviewed it 
the logistics for the cleanup will be staggering the 44 crucial 
sites selected by the state for immediate action have at least 240 
miles of often rugged shoreline and there are about 3000 rocky 
beaches tainted by oil in all 
meanwhile fishing boats carried makeshift barriers toward the 
oilfouled coast of katmai national park where bears emerging from 
hibernation were feared to be feasting on tainted and potentially 
toxic carcasses and clams 
shifting winds threatened to push balls of tarlike sludge 
toward homer and other cook inlet communities and the herring 
fishery at the north end of kodiak island was closed for fear of 
contamination 
battles were waged on various fronts some of them hundreds of 
miles from where the tanker exxon valdez ran aground march 24 and 
spilled 101 million gallons of thick crude oil 
during the morning yost watched an armada of boats skim oil 
from the surface of the resourcerich waters of prince william 
sound where the damage was worst 
he said he wants to see the recovery operation pick up tempo so 
that in two or three weeks we have a sizable number of people 
maybe in the hundreds on the beach 
john shannon assistant secretary of the army said the pentagon 
had decided to send in additional helicopters two amphibious navy 
floatels and two army corps of engineer dredges 
the amphibious ships due to arrive in about a week can sleep 
more than 1000 people each precisely the type of support that 
state officials have found lacking as they face the task of 
cleaning the rocky coast 
the national weather service said 15knot southerly winds would 
blow until sunday morning at the tip of the kenai peninsula moving 
the oil sheen and sludge into cook inlet the winds were expected 
to shift to the west later sunday pushing the oil toward homer 
seldovia and other fishrich communities on kachemak bay 
in kodiak meanwhile 27 fishing vessels set out or were 
preparing to leave on missions to spot and stop the oil some of 
which had congealed into blobs just beneath the surface kodiak is 
the nations no 1 fishing port with a catch worth 166 million 
last year 
at the north end of the port the herring fishery near shuyak 
and afognak islands opened at noon saturday but was closed a few 
hours later while officials assessed the threat from nearby oil 
basically we cant have even the remotest possibility of 
having an oiled product leaving the state of alaska said bruce 
erickson a supervisor with the department of environmental 
conservation 
with commercial oilblocking booms in short supply six ships 
were outfitted with nets containing a curtain of heavy woven 
fabric said linda freed a spokeswoman for the emergency center in 
kodiak they hoped to capture oil off katmai national park and 
steer it toward currents that would carry it away from land 
its a long shot but at least were trying ms freed said 
oil has been washing up at kenai fjords national park for more 
than a week and was reported on shore friday at katmai situated in 
the stormy shelikof strait some 300 miles from the spill site 
the main ribbon of oil which defiled thousands of rocky beaches 
in the sound has drifted 225 miles southwest to the tip of the 
kenai peninsula 
at homer 200 residents built booms in hopes of blocking the 
oil said ray springer the local boss for a contractor working for 
exxon 
but one of the greatest fears was for wildlife at katmai 
national park where huge brown bears feasting on salmon are as 
much a tourist draw as the volcanic valley of 10000 smokes and the 
15 active volcanoes lining the shelikof strait 
a 40squaremile slick floated off the north edge of the katmai 
coast and oil washed up near the big river where observers from a 
plane saw a bear digging clams from the stained sand said park 
service spokesman john quinley 
weve seen pictures of dead deer in prince william sound that 
ate oiltainted kelp and it looks like we could be seeing brown 
bear meeting the same fate quinley said 
right now the bears are coming out of their dens said ray 
bane park superintendent the boars are first to emerge and 
theyll be followed in a week or 10 days by the sows with cubs 
because ice and snow still cover much of the area many of the 
bears head directly for the beach to forage looking for 
carcasses seaweed clams whatever else they can come up with 
bane said 
were concerned about the direct impact the physical 
presence of oil on the shore and the bears getting into it 
but we are perhaps more concerned about those animals that may 
be killed elsewhere by this spill and wash up on shore otters 
sea birds anything thats being killed and the bears have no way 
to distinguish these from good food 
ocean currents probably will carry dead animals from all over 
the region to the shelikof area bane said

a northrop division that made electronic 
guidance components for cruise missiles was a place where getting 
along meant going along with incompetence and shoddy work a former 
employee says 
florence castaneda was one of three former northrop employees 
whose repeated complaints finally got the attention of federal 
investigators resulting in charges filed last week 
she said she was motivated by her worries over nuclear weapons 
with bad guidance systems which could be the start of world war 
iii the los angeles times reported saturday 
castaneda a senior assembler technician certified by the 
national aeronautics and space administration for a variety of 
electronics work said her struggle has left her feeling alienated 
and mistrustful of the aerospace industry 
from the day she started work at northrops western services 
department in el monte in october 1983 castaneda said she was 
appalled 
she saw employees in an electronics clean room smoking 
cigarettes eating lunch at work stations and watching soap operas 
on televisions she told the times 
northrop corp and five current and former employees were 
indicted tuesday on charges of conspiring to defraud the government 
in assembling part of the air forces cruise missile guidance 
system and a component for the navys harrier jet fighter 
northrop spokesman tony cantafio said saturday that the company 
acted on complaints about the plant two years ago 
we fired the plant manager and three other employees in 
1987 cantafio said and in december 87 we shut the plant 
down that is action that we took when it came to our attention 
the indictment charged that northrop and the five including 
castanedas boss conspired to install parts for the cruise missile 
flight data transmitter that failed to meet government 
specifications 
the terrainhugging cruise missile one of the most versatile 
weapons in the us arsenal is capable of carrying either a 
conventional or nuclear warhead 
castaneda said she began by complaining to her superior charles 
gonsalves one of those who was fired and who was named in the 
tuesday indictment among her complaints was the lack of coding for 
component wires a standard procedure in the aerospace industry to 
trace their origin 
when i started to raise concerns mr gonsalves told me that 
if i just did my work like everybody else we would get along 
castaneda told the times 
but a nephew in the air national guard arranged a meeting with 
agents from the air forces office of special investigations 
castaneda said she invited fellow workers leocadio barajas and 
patricia meyer 
barajas later was fired after confronting gonsalves and he and 
meyer eventually joined in a lawsuit against northrop alleging the 
firm had defrauded the government by improperly testing the missile 
parts the justice department later joined the suit 
castaneda went on temporary disability from northrop in april 
1985 because of stress and a back injury 
castaneda told the times a psychologist was assigned to her 
through northrops insurance adjuster but his message was to 
forgive northrop and to forgive mr gonsalves to ask god to 
forgive them and to just go back to work she said 
castaneda left northrop for good in april 1987

letters to princess anne from a handsome aide have 
raised speculation of a royal divorce an occurrence that has 
wrought constitutional upheavals and brought heartbreak to queen 
elizabeth iis family 
whether annes 15year marriage to capt mark phillips is really 
on the rocks or is simply one of those longdistance unions not 
unusual in the british upper classes remains open to question 
the queens only daughter and phillips a commoner and former 
army captain who runs equestrian centers lead virtually separate 
lives they were apart for more than half the time last year they 
have two children peter 11 and zara 7 
news of the mysterious collection of letters to anne 38 from 
royal navy cmdr timothy laurence a 34yearold bachelor and 
equerry at buckingham palace gave new life to rumors which began 
in 1981 that her marriage is in trouble 
the four stolen letters were delivered last week to a mass 
circulation newspaper the sun which did not publish them police 
are investigating the theft 
with panting headlines the tabloid press said anne and laurence 
are in love 
as usual the principal characters said little or nothing 
anne carried on with a punishing schedule of routine royal 
engagements phillips 40 went off to spain to see about setting 
up a riding center there and laurence dropped out of sight 
anne is only seventh in line to the throne behind her brothers 
charles andrew and edward two young nephews and a baby niece so 
her divorce would hardly bring a constitutional crisis 
it was not always so 
divorce has hung over the throne since the sixtimes married 
henry viii broke with the roman catholic church in 1534 because the 
vatican would not annul his marriage to catherine of aragon 
each succeeding monarch is titular head of the church of 
england which frowns on divorce 
annes greatuncle edward viii gave up the throne to marry a 
twicedivorced american wallis simpson in a celebrated broadcast 
on dec 11 1936 he told the nation he could not go on as king 
without the support of the woman i love 
as the duke and duchess of windsor the couple lived in exile 
mainly in paris he died in 1972 and she in 1986 
in the next generation the queens only sister princess 
margaret gave up the man she loved because he was divorced he was 
royal air force group capt peter townsend 
the young princess then aged 25 told the nation that 
mindful of the churchs teaching that christian marriage is 
indissoluble conscious of my duty to the commonwealth i have 
resolved to put these considerations before any others 
townsend a dashing battle of britain pilot and former aide to 
margarets father george vi moved to belgium where he married 
again happily 
margaret has never seemed to find happiness 
in 1960 she married tony armstrongjones a talented 
photographer and designer who was created earl of snowdon 
the snowdons who have two children were divorced in 1978 he 
has remarried she has not 
despite changed attitudes in a country where one in three 
marriages ends in divorce some royal commentators speculate that 
anne will choose to stay married to phillips while leading a 
separate life 
richard kay royal correspondent for londons daily mail argued 
that another royal divorce would erode further the concept that 
the royal family are somehow different from the rest of us 
in the 1970s princess margaret had a widely publicized 
relationship with a london socialite 17 years her junior roddy 
llewellyn newspapers regularly photographed them heading off on 
caribbean vacations 
but generally discretion is the key for the modern royals 
in contrast queen victorias heir edward vii was noted most 
for his famous mistresses actress lillie langtry social siren 
daisy brooke who became countess of warwick and scottish baronets 
daughter alice keppel 
he came to the throne in 1901 and continued seeing mrs keppel 
until he died in 1910

in a move that would reverse the policies of the 
reagan white house the bush administration is expected to announce 
stricter fuel efficiency rules for 1990 automobiles the new york 
times reported 
the times reported in its editions saturday that transportation 
secretary samuel k skinner has decided that automakers should be 
required to attain an average fuel consumption of 275 miles per 
gallon in all cars they manufacture the current standard is 265 
miles per gallon 
the times said that should president bush endorse skinners 
proposal as expected the endorsement could send a message that the 
new administration is a strong advocate of preserving the 
environment 
the reagan administration had proposed repealing the fuel 
economy requirements which were first imposed in 1974 when the 
nation was in an oil crisis 
although the nations automakers will not welcome the ruling it 
is not expected to have immediate drastic repercussions in detroit 
the newspaper reported 
it is too late to change the design of the 1990 models but the 
automobile industry probably will meet the new requirements by 
selling more of the smaller fuelefficient cars the times said 
since the standards apply to the average mileage of all vehicles 
made by one company automakers likely will provide rebates and 
incentives to lure buyers to smaller highefficiency cars 
companies can fall short of the fuel goal in one year without 
any penalties if they exceed the standard the next year 
the times reported that the stricter 1990 standard does not mean 
that the bush administration intends to impose even higher 
standards in later years 
but the newspaper said that a higher standard will help the bush 
administration portray itself as being sensitive to the 
environment especially in face of the oil spill disaster in 
valdez alaska 
unidentified officials told the times that secretary skinner was 
especially mindful of energy production in making his decision 
automobiles burn about 30 percent of all the oil used in the united 
states and fuelefficient cars have long been seen as a tool of 
conservation the newspaper said 
foreign cars imported into the united states also must meet the 
standards 
most foreign cars have no trouble meeting the standard but some 
manufacturers of cars like the jaguar mercedes benz and porches 
have not always met the standard and have to pay penalties to the 
government

americans watching television may have been 
surprised to see police exhibiting suspects in a cult of satanic 
killings but displaying prisoners is a common practice in latin 
america 
basically its to show the news media they werent beaten up 
they are healthy and in the same condition they were when they were 
arrested said maurilio mendoza chief prosecuting supervisor for 
drug cases at the federal attorney generals office 
of course they always look a little sad because of the crime 
they are accused of and the consequences that await them he 
added 
the presumption of innocence frequently is ignored as 
publications carry pictures of suspected drug dealers car thieves 
bank robbers and murderers being shown to reporters confiscated 
bags of drugs or other stolen items often are arrayed on a table in 
front of the prisoners 
suspects in the killings of 13 people in a matamoros drug cult 
were paraded before television cameras last week and answered 
questions from journalists reporters and cameramen were allowed at 
a site friday as one suspect pointed out a grave and was forced to 
dig up the victim 
former petroleum union leader joaquin galicia hernandez who was 
arrested on corruption charges in january always uses the public 
displays to declare that his arrest was all because of politics 
but when drug kingpin miguel angel felix gallardo was shown to 
journalists this week he refused to say a word 
criminal defense attorney fernando villanueva said the 
exhibition of suspects probably reflects a desire by authorities to 
comply with requirements on press freedom and freedom of 
expression police do not have to present or not present a person 
to the media 
another trial lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the purpose was to pile up psychological evidence against the 
accused 
under mexican law a person is presumed innocent until proven 
guilty but eduardo loyo and other attorneys say in practice it is 
often the reverse 
lawyers say other legal requirements often violated are that a 
suspect be presented to a judge within 24 hours after the arrest 
that the judge indict or free a person within 72 hours and that a 
case be tried within one year if no complications arise 
the procedures and the law are mainly based on the napoleonic 
code in civil cases but in penal cases it is a combination of 
french and spanish law with mexican peculiarities loyo said 
suspects remanded for trial are held in detention centers called 
reclusorios which at the federal level generally are clean and 
wellrun 
with the wardens permission prisoners are allowed to bring in 
their own food receive conjugal visits and decorate their cells 
although it is known that some prisoners have been able to gain 
early release by bribes convicts in highly publicized cases are 
unlikely to get the chance 
in one recent case two state judges were charged with accepting 
a 200000 bribe to order the early release of a man convicted of 
torturing and killing a young girl 
mexico has not applied the death penalty since 1932 
in january president carlos salinas de gortari raised the 
maximum penalty for firstdegree murder from 40 years to 50

democratic congressional leaders say theyll 
subscribe to president bushs nonewtaxes pledge in order to pass 
a 12 trillion budget for the next fiscal year but beyond that 
all bets are off 
when we get into the negotiations for 1991 everything is 
going to be on the table and frankly i dont see how you get from 
point a to point b without having revenues senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn said friday when a 
budget agreement for 1990 was announced 
next time were going to have to start looking for some 
revenues sasser said 
congressional leaders joined bush in unveiling the bipartisan 
budget agreement which would reduce the federal deficit to 994 
billion just under the 100 billion limit set by the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law without new taxes 
but the accord thrashed out in more than a month of highlevel 
negotiations puts off most hard decisions on spending details 
until later the budget agreement itself lacks the force of law 
but it does provide a framework for actual spending bills to be 
passed later 
very hard choices lie ahead senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine said friday at a rose garden ceremony 
what the agreement aims to do is prevent the kinds of partisan 
disputes that push negotiations to the wire when the new fiscal 
year changes in the fall 
missing from the agreement is any suggestion of where the funds 
would come from to pay for bushs proposals for increased spending 
for educational programs the homeless or more environmental 
protection 
also left unresolved was bushs proposal for a reduction in the 
capitalgains tax from the current 28 percent to 15 percent his 
1988 campaign pledge 
democrats say they are firmly opposed with sasser calling the 
chances of passage slim and none 
under the budget accord bush agreed to back a smaller defense 
budget for 1990 than in the budget he submitted on feb 9 2992 
billion for all defenserelated programs including nuclearweapons 
programs in the energy department compared with the original 
3006 billion request 
it also calls for discretionary domestic spending of 1813 
billion up from the 1759 billion proposed by bush it raises 
spending in socalled entitlement social programs where benefits 
to individuals are mandated by law of 5564 billion up from 
bushs proposal for 5314 billion 
overall the plan calls for total deficit reductions of about 
28 billion for the fiscal year that begins next oct 1 the 
projected 1990 deficit of 994 billion compares with a 1989 
deficit estimated by the administration as 1633 billion 
at the rose garden ceremony bush called the pact the first 
such agreement reached ahead of schedule and not framed in the 
context of a crisis and said it was a first manageable step 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
boycotted the rose garden session entirely 
he declined to go out into the rose garden and have his 
picture taken because he doesnt like the agreement said bentsen 
spokesman jack devore 
bush long has contended that a final bipartisan accord on the 
budget would be cheered by financial markets and help to nudge down 
interest rates 
asked if fridays agreement would satisfy the markets budget 
director richard darman said no this agreement will be helpful 
but this will not be sufficient for the long term

jurors neared the deliberations stage in the 
trial of former white house aide oliver north after a final week 
of testimony in which prosecutors tried to show north had a 
personal financial stake in aiding the nicaraguan rebels 
the charges against north should be in the hands of the us 
district court jury toward the end of next week the last of 48 
witnesses gave their testimony on friday in a trial that has lasted 
11 weeks 
after prosecutor john keker and defense attorney brendan 
sullivan rested their cases us district judge gerhard a gesell 
announced that all the evidence is in ladies and gentlemen 
told the jury youre great and sent them home after saying that 
they will be isolated during deliberations 
the jurors will return tuesday for final arguments expected to 
take most of two days 
in the past week the prosecution tried to undermine norths 
credibility and depict him as venal by emphasizing his relationship 
with irancontra codefendant richard secord who will be tried 
separately 
keker brought a used car salesman into the courtroom friday who 
had sold north an 8000 station wagon in 1985 north had said four 
days earlier he had paid for the 1982 chevrolet suburban out of 
15000 kept in a metal box in his closet at home 
the salesman william howell said north told him he would pay 
the final 3000 on the vehicle out of the white house credit 
union howell also disputed norths contention that he had come to 
the car lot intending to buy a 5000 station wagon and then moved 
up to the 8000 vehicle north testified he only had 5000 with 
him and had to return to the metal box at home to get the remainder 
four days later 
keker pointedly asked north whether he had gotten 3000 from 
secord whose office is a mile or two from the car dealership the 
same day north paid off the car purchase north said he couldnt 
remember but insisted he got the money for the car from his metal 
box 
north enlisted secord in 1984 to secretly run arms to the 
nicaraguan contras and as a result 48 million flowed through the 
enterprise he set up with business partner albert hakim 
the prosecution also brought in willard zucker a swissbased 
lawyer who moved money for hakim and secord for the contra 
operation and the iran arms initiative 
zucker testified that he met with norths wife betsy in march 
1986 to discuss the north childrens education 
north explained that hakim had wanted to provide for his family 
if something happened to him on his dangerous clandestine mission 
to tehran in 1986 and had told him only that mrs north was to meet 
hakims lawyer 
hakim has testified 200000 was set aside for mrs north and 
her family in the event of norths death 
mary dix a former nsc supervisor said north was extremely 
pinched for money and complained about not having enough to buy 
lunch and gasoline his complaints suddenly stopped in mid1985 
she said 
north is accused of accepting a 13800 home security system 
from secord and converting to his own use 4300 from a huge cash 
fund in his office safe financed by contra leader adolfo calero and 
secord

gasoline price increases that followed last 
months alaskan oil spill were prompted by customer worries rather 
than real threats to the nations fuel supply energy secretary 
james d watkins says 
watkins predicted friday that prices are likely to return soon 
to normal seasonal levels 
retail gasoline prices in recent days have jumped to their 
highest levels in three years watkins took the unusual step of 
issuing the public statement in an effort to ease the customer 
concerns 
the interruption of alaskan crude created serious concern for 
future supply curtailments in product markets he said this 
concern more than actual supply curtailments triggered price 
increases 
analysts mostly attribute the price increases to higher crude 
oil prices and widespread anticipation that gasoline supplies will 
be squeezed by an increase in summer auto travel 
watkins said an additional key factor has been the imposition of 
state and federal rules that reduce gasoline vapor emissions but 
increase refining costs 
on monday sen howard metzenbaum dohio is to open hearings 
on whether the oil companies increases in gasoline prices are 
justified by economic conditions he suggested the companies were 
using the alaska spill as an excuse to raise prices 
watkins said that the loss of crude oil as a result of the march 
24 tanker spill was 13 million barrels or about 17 hours of 
national consumption 
supplies are not threatened watkins said shortages have 
not occurred 
shipments of alaskan north slope crude from the port of valdez 
were temporarily curtailed after the spill but the flow this week 
returned to normal 
gasoline price increases have been largest on the west coast 
which is the main destination of alaskan crude nationally the 
average price of a gallon of gasoline rose 10 percent to 110 in 
the last month according to the lundberg survey a los angeles 
publication that checks prices at 12000 gasoline stations 
nationwide 
watkins earlier rejected a call by rep philip sharp dind to 
prepare for possible use of the strategic petroleum reserve sharp 
said in a letter to watkins last week that announcing preparation 
to tap into the underground emergency oil stocks would take the 
edge off market speculation that was driving up gasoline prices

a large california savings and loan that 
allegedly had undue clout with politicians and regulators became 
the second thrift to be taken over recently by the government 
despite being technically solvent 
the federal home loan bank board said friday that the 29branch 
lincoln savings and loan association in irvine had dissipated its 
54 billion in assets had let its capital dwindle to 20 million 
and was operating in an unsafe and unsound manner 
another large savings and loan gibraltar savings of beverly 
hills calif was seized march 31 regulators stressed that 
lincolns branches would remain open as usual and that all deposits 
were guaranteed up to the 100000 insurance limit 
lincoln has been up for sale while its parent american 
continental corp a luxury resort developer based in phoenix 
ariz prepared to file for federal bankruptcy protection which 
was done thursday 
american continental has contributed heavily to senate campaigns 
and had allegedly received favorable treatment from regulators 
the bank board said lincolns financial troubles started in 
february 1984 when it was bought by american continental and its 
management invested in risky real estate ventures stocks and junk 
bonds 
management appeared to operate lincoln mainly for the benefit 
of american continental corp and has repeatedly violated 
regulations and has refused to follow supervisory directives 
a bank board statement said 
lincoln and its owner american continental chairman charles h 
keating have been the subject of considerable controversy over the 
last two years 
an examination completed in may 1987 by regulators at the 
federal home loan bank in san francisco turned up substantial 
irregularities and recommended the seizure of the institution 
keating then alleged bias by the regional officials who 
technically work for a board controlled by sampl executives in 
competition with lincoln and complained to the nations top thrift 
regulator m danny wall the chairman of the federal bank board 
wall in an action that angered members of congress and top 
regulators at other banking agencies prohibited regional officials 
from acting against lincoln in november 1987 he granted a new 
review which was conducted by examiners based in washington that 
exam concluded a year later upheld the findings of the san 
francisco agency 
at one point five senators who received campaign contributions 
ranging from 34000 to 112000 from american continental officers 
and employees met with regional regulators at the request of 
lincoln 
attending the april 1987 meeting in san francisco were sens 
donald w riegle dmich alan cranston dcalif dennis 
deconcini dariz john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz 
riegle who would become chairman of the senate banking committee 
less than a year later subsequently returned his 76100 
contribution 
the house banking committee chairman rep henry b gonzalez on 
friday renewed his call for walls resignation blaming wall for 
the gross mishandling of the case and months of delay that will 
ultimately cost taxpayers millions of dollars 
wall in a telephone interview said that until lincolns parent 
company sought bankruptcy protection the bank board faced legal 
obstacles in taking over the institution while it was still solvent 
he defended the decision to conduct an independent review of the 
san francisco officials findings saying enough questions had been 
raised about their actions to warrant a second look

colombian president virgilio barco says the 
only way to battle drug trafficking successfully is if all the 
countries of the americas join together in the fight 
drug production consumption and traffic is not a problem of 
one nation not even of a group of nations barco told the 
american societ of newspaper editors on friday it is a universal 
scourge we cannot expect successful results if colombia or 
for that matter any country is left to act alone 
barco said the scourge could not be ended until the united 
states which consumes more than half the worlds supply of 
cocaine reduces its demand for the drug and he called for a 
summit of the presidents of the americas to focus on the problem 
the insatiable demand for drugs in this country is also the 
greatest single threat to democracy in our hemisphere barco said 
the only law narcotics traffic does not break is the economic 
law of supply and demand he said if cocaine sales are 
tolerated on your streets coca will continue to be grown in the 
hidden valleys and hillsides of south america we can only break 
this trail through concerted action at both ends 
among the summit topics he said would be the sharing of police 
intelligence and satellite information better interdiction both of 
drugs and of chemicals needed to make those drugs better transport 
and equipment for law enforcement agencies and more support for 
programs to develop alternative sources of income in coca producing 
areas 
president bush suggested such a summit during the presidential 
campaign last year but there have been no plans set bush who is 
not meeting with barco during his trip to washington has invited 
him to visit again in july for an official working visit the white 
house announced thursday 
barco stressed that his country has suffered extensively with 
drugtraffickers having directed executions of guillermo cano the 
outspoken editor of el espectador as well as the deaths of another 
30 newsmen a minister of justice an attorney general judges and 
more than 1300 policemen 
contrary to what so many american tv drama programs suggest 
colombia is not a nation of criminals he said rather we too 
are victims of the scourge of narcotics 
national drug control policy director william j bennett who 
addressed the editors just before barco also focused on the need 
to reduce the demand for drugs 
if we did education right the drug problem would only be on 
the periphery on the fringe of society he said 
bennett called for construction of new prisons for incarceration 
of both drug traffickers as well as socalled casual users 
meanwhile attorney general dick thornburgh met friday with the 
attorney general of mexico enrique alvarez del castillo during 
which he congratulated alvarez for the recent efforts by mexicos 
new government to crack down on major drug traffickers 
thornburgh said in a statement that he and alvarez agreed to 
establish closer ties in the war on drugs 
those ties include working on joint operations increased 
assistance to the mexican government in the training of police and 
drug enforcement agents and the establishment of bilateral working 
groups to study proposals for increasing crossborder 
cooperation upgrading efforts to seize the assets of major drug 
traffickers and updating the extradition treaty between our two 
countries

a state appeals court has upheld a ruling 
against a man who claimed his son was cheated out of a 1987 
spelling bee championship 
as for the judgment of the trial court appellate judge 
arthur gilbert ruled wednesday well spell it out 
affirmed 
leonard mcdonald of thousand oaks claimed his son gavin then 
13 lost the ventura county spelling bee because two students 
instead of one from los altos school in camarillo were allowed by 
the sponsoring ventura starfree press to advance in the contest 
in the camarillo contest student victor wang had spelled 
horsy and steven chen had spelled it horsey 
although judges ruled that steven won starfree press officials 
said an unacceptable dictionary had been used a tie was declared 
because websters third new international dictionary said both 
spellings were correct both victor and steven were allowed to go 
on to the countywide competition where steven beat gavin in the 
27th round 
gavins father argued that steven shouldnt have been allowed to 
compete in the county finals and asked for 2 million in damages 
in his lawsuit mcdonald named the newspaper the papers editor at 
the time and scripps howard newspaper group which runs the 
national spelling bee in washington 
mcdonald contended his son suffered unfair treatment that caused 
him to lose his standing in the community and suffer humiliation 
indignity grief fright and mental anguish 
ventura county superior court judge kenneth yegan dismissed the 
case in november 1987 but the case was appealed 
gilbert in upholding yegans action called the lawsuit 
frivolous and said the reason gavin lost was that he finally 
misspelled a word 
gavin took first place in his school and can be justifiably 
proud of his performance gilbert wrote it is this lawsuit 
that is trivial not his achievement our courts try to give 
redress for real harms they cannot offer palliatives for imagined 
injuries 
john bowman editor of the starfree press said he was pleased 
the matter was resolved

nasa has selected april 28 as date 
for launching atlantis on the first space shuttle planetary mission 
with the magellanvenus probe 
the decision was announced friday following a comprehensive 
twoday review of all aspects of the flight by more than 200 
shuttle managers and engineers liftoff of the shuttle atlantis was 
set for 224 pm edt 
while we have much work to do and little contingency time we 
have established an april 28 launch date nasa shuttle director 
richard truly said 
that had been the unofficial launch target for several weeks 
during their fourday flight atlantis five astronauts are to 
release the 378 million magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay 
starting it on a 466day journey to venus 
the spacecraft is to orbit the cloudcovered planet in august 
1990 and map its surface over the next 243 days with a 
highresolution radar system 
magellan is the first new american planetary spacecraft since 
pioneer 13 was launched in 1978 also to venus it also is the 
first planetary payload to be carried by a space shuttle 
the goal of magellan is to obtain radar images of at least 70 
percent of the planet said stephen saunders magellan project 
scientist at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
the radar is intended to produce images showing features as 
small as 150 feet across in comparison pioneer 13 could not 
distinguish features any smaller than 60 miles across 
saunders said the images would help scientists understand how 
venus was formed and might provide answers to the puzzling question 
of how earth and venus with a surface temperature of 900 degrees 
fahrenheit evolved so differently even though at the beginning of 
the solar system 48 billion years ago they were almost identical 
he said the magellan pictures might answer questions about the 
extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether venus 
once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal plates 
similiar to those on earth 
commanding the astronaut crew is veteran shuttle pilot david 
walker the others are pilot ron grabe and mission specialists mary 
cleave mark lee and norman thagard

supporters of william lucas to head the 
justice departments civil rights division were given a boost when 
a liberal michigan congressman endorsed the republican a fellow 
black from detroit 
rep john conyers joining the debate over attorney general dick 
thornburghs choice of lucas on friday urged president bush to 
expedite the nomination 
conyers endorsement may blunt the potential effect of the 682 
vote the detroit naacp took last monday to oppose lucas whose 
nomination has not been formally announced by bush 
coupled with a decision wednesday night by the detroit urban 
league to endorse lucas conyers support could head off additional 
opposition 
other civil rights groups while privately expressing 
reservations about lucas have withheld public comment perhaps to 
assess the political climate on capitol hill 
conyers a democrat took issue with statements by civil rights 
leaders that lucas lacks the necessary experience for the job 
experience is not the issue in the lucas appointment 
conyers said in a statement the most important issue is the 
nominees commitment to civil rights enforcement and affirmative 
action 
after eight years of william bradford reynolds at the helm of 
the civil rights division bill lucas will be a breath of fresh 
air conyers said 
i believe he is qualified to do the job conyers said i 
am confident of his commitment to moving the federal government 
back into being an advocate for civil rights 
civil rights groups have questioned lucas qualifications for 
the job noting his lack of experience in the civil rights movement 
lucas a former sheriff and later chief executive of waymally 
submitted by bush is subject to senate confirmation 
lucas ran as the gops unsuccessful candidate for michigan 
governor in 1968 his choice as civil rights chief is seen by 
political observers as part of the republican partys efforts to 
attract more black voters 
critics who have questioned lucas commitment to civil rights 
noted his statements on affirmative action 
his record as sheriff has also been cited by opponents who 
point out he was cited for contempt of court in 1976 for failing to 
reduce overcrowding in the wayne county jail when he was sheriff

a tearful woman told how she was brutalized 
during pregnancy as the march of dimes birth defects foundation 
urged doctors and nurses to watch for signs that expectant mothers 
have been beaten 
one out of 12 pregnant women is a victim of battering said 
betsy berkhemercredaire head of the groups southern california 
chapter she is not the only victim her unborn child is 
incredibly at risk because of this battering 
nurses a prosecutor and the operator of a battered womens 
shelter joined berkhemercredaire on friday at a march of dimes 
news conference intended to increase awareness of abuse of pregnant 
women 
also attending was 28yearold mary siering who choked back 
tears as she recounted how her boyfriend abused her while she was 
pregnant 
he slapped me in the face he threw a sneaker at my stomach 
when i was five months pregnant and he put me in a headlock she 
sobbed he held me hostage in the apartment against my will when 
i tried to call 911 he ripped the cord out of the wall 
siering a social worker for los angeles county said her 
boyfriend fled to the east coast without being prosecuted and her 
child rita frances now 2 trusts the world because her mother 
cares enough to protect her 
still battered women are four times more likely to deliver 
babies with low birth weights and twice as likely to miscarry 
compared with other mothers berkhemercredaire said 
lowbirthweight babies are more likely to be born with birth 
defects and more than 40 times more likely to die during the first 
month of life she added 
she and others urged doctors and nurses to watch for signs of 
battering in their pregnant patients and to help document injuries 
so the assailants can be prosecuted 
battered women also should seek help and emergency shelter and 
leave those abusing them said participants in the conference at 
kaiser permanente los angeles medical center 
abuse against expectant mothers happens in all racial and 
socioeconomic groups said anne stewart helton a community health 
nurse consultant at texas womens university 
helton conducted a foundationfinanced study of 290 pregnant 
women randomly selected from public and private prenatal clinics in 
houston she found 8 percent or one in 12 were beaten by their 
male partners during pregnancy and another 15 percent reported 
being battered earlier 
more research is needed to confirm her belief that the 
statistics are valid nationwide helton said but many experts 
believe the onein12 figure is low because women tend to fear 
admitting they have been abused she said 
only one in every five incidents of domestic violence is 
reported said mia baker a special assistant district attorney 
who runs los angeles countys victimwitness assistance program 
she said 4000 american women die at their partners hands each 
year 
the march of dimes said 3 million to 4 million american women 
are battered each year resulting in onefifth of all hospital 
emergency room visits by women their injuries account for annual 
costs of 100 million for medical care and up to 5 million in 
absenteeism

the government is halting special inspections 
of fruit from chile after coming up with no evidence of poisoning 
since traces of cyanide were found in two grapes a month ago 
but fruit from the south american country will still be subject 
to routine random spot checks at us ports of entry the food and 
drug administration said friday in its announcement 
the fda said it expects the chilean government to continue 
inspecting 1 percent of its fruit shipments bound for the united 
states for the rest of its growing season which is winding down 
fda commissioner frank young said the cooperation of chilean 
officials as well as greater consumer awareness as well as 
laboratory studies and the finding of no additional problems in 
chilean fruit combined to end the need for the enhanced 
inspections 
when the tainted grapes were found march 12 after a 
cyanidepoisoning threat telephoned to the us embassy in the 
chilean capital of santiago the fda urged that all fruit from 
chile be removed from store shelves and imposed a temporary 
detention on chilean fruit shipments at the docks 
five days later the agency began a steppedup inspection plan 
for fruit being held in warehouses and at the docks but about 35 
million cases of fruit worth about 41 million that was held by 
wholesalers and retailers had to be dumped 
chilean fruit exporters and us importers said they lost about 
240 million because of the health scare but david holzworth a 
washington attorney who represents the chilean exporters 
association said the fda has been moving as rapidly as possible 
to get things back to normal 
chilean grapes virtually the only fresh grapes available in 
us stores at this time of year began reappearing on produce 
counters about two weeks after the poisoned grapes were found among 
samples at the port at philadelphia grapes constitute about 70 
percent of chiles fruit exports 
after grapes and berries other chilean fruits including 
pears nectarines apples plums and peaches were cleared in the 
inspection program for sale to wholesalers and retailers and soon 
began appearing on store shelves 
since the fda began its enhanced surveillance plan march 17 it 
has gradually reduced the proportion of shipments that had to be 
visually inspected the plan began with inspections required for 5 
percent of each shipment and was reduced to 4 percent on march 27 
and to 1 percent on april 6 
the inspections were carried out under the fdas supervision by 
several hundred inspectors who were paid by chilean fruit 
importers 
under the plan more than 9 million crates of chilean fruit has 
been inspected and cleared for sale the fda said

the agriculture department says widespread 
opposition in the honeybee industry prompted it to cancel a planned 
quarantine of states where a parasitic mite is plaguing apiaries 
the proposal would have applied to 19 states the district of 
columbia and 15 us territories or other possessions known or 
believed to be infested with the varroa mite public comments were 
solicited through march 31 
the comments we have received indicate widespread opposition 
to the proposed varroa mite program james w glosser 
administrator of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service said friday 
without extensive support from the affected groups a federal 
effort to retard the spread of varroa cannot work he said 
under the proposed quarantine the interstate movement of 
honeybees and bee equipment would have been restricted such 
articles would have required inspection and or treatment before 
being allowed to move across state lines 
varroa mites were discovered in the united states in a wisconsin 
apiary in september 1987 the usda imposed a quarantine in april 
1988 but was canceled after a month because it was too complex to 
administer 
the mite is an external parasite of adult honeybees and their 
developing larvae or brood infestations cause decreased brood 
numbers deformed bees and weaken the bees ability to pollinate 
plants and produce honey

the 1906 earthquake has shattered san

planet and ostrichplumed showgirls have paraded down the grand 
staircase on the worlds largest stage 
but after 11 years of pleasing the crowds at ballys hello 
hollywood hello is saying goodbye to make way for dino liza and 
frank 
its a wonderful wonderful show but its run 11 years and in 
the last couple of years the audience has been down our surveys 
showed that people wanted to see name stars said richard sturm 
vi entertainment at ballys hotelcasinos 
dean martin will inaugurate the new policy april 27 after the 
shows last performance april 18 martin will be followed by paul 
anka barbara mce president forandrell liza minnelli barry manilow and 
frank 
sinatra 
it will be a real sadness said diane petersen a principal 
singer who has been with the show since it opened june 2 1978 
thats always a difficult part of our business you become so 
close to people then face the reality that youve got to go other 
directions 
michael eardley a principal singer who also has been with the 
show from its opening echoed the spirit of family in the 90membere 
the waterfalls weigh six tons each another set weighs 10 tons 
the stage built solely to accommodate hello hollywood is 
58 feet shorter than a football field and 180 feet wide three 
giant elevators descend into a basement below for scene changes 
sturm said ballys was not ruling out the possibility of future 
productions in reno and that there has been talk of selling 
hello hollywood earthquakes waterfalls and all if a buyer 
comes along 
greg glodowski a principal dancer who moved here nine years ago 
from the pittsburgh ballet theater said the area will lose a 
valuable pool of talent when the show closes he will stay in reno 
to work as an attorney specializing in tax matters and will dance 
with the local ballet company 
eardley and his dancerwife katherine who met 4 years ago on 
the hello hollywood stage run a recording studio and music 
production company 
petersen is considering public relations work so she can remain 
in the reno area if another performing opportunity doesnt come 
along 
hello hollywood was developed around a motion picture theme 
when the casino was the mgm grand and the scenes remained after 
ballys bought it three years ago 
eardley said it is essentially the same show as when it opened 
a sameness that challenges the performers to keep their scenes 
fresh 
you may be bored or sick as a dog and not feel like singing a 
love song but this is a business like any other and you call upon 
your technique and discipline and thats what gets you through 
he said 
you know that most of the people out there are seeing it for 
the first time peterson said theyre going to see it one 
time so you want to be the best that you can be

the quality of corporate debt improved in the 
first quarter the quality of corporate debt deteriorated in the 
first quarter 
which you believe depends on which of the two major bondrating 
services you listen to 
standard amp poors corp says the quality of corporate credit as 
determined by the companys ratings of debt issues improved in the 
januarymarch period 
moodys investors service the other major debtrating service 
says that corporate credit quality continued its downward trend 
due mainly to buyouts restructurings and stock buybacks that 
affect corporate debt levels 
for the quarter sampp says it upgraded the ratings of 88 debt 
issues representing about 63 billion in debt while it downgraded 
64 issues representing about 30 billion the number it upgraded 
was about 13 times the number it downgraded 
moodys says it upgraded 32 companies representing 33 billion 
debt while it downgraded 66 totaling 47 billion moodys 
downgradetoupgrade ratio was 21to1 
one of the reasons for the vastly different snapshots of 
firstquarter debt quality is the timing of when the two ratings 
services upgrades or downgrades various debt issues 
there may be leads and lags said john lonski moodys 
senior economist 
for example moodys upgraded 39 billion in usx corp debt 
last september sampp didnt make a similar upgrade involving 5 
billion in usx debt until the first quarter thus accounting for 
some of the difference in the overall quarterly ratings improvement 
noted by sampp 
similarly some of the bonds moodys downgraded during the 
quarter may have been downgraded earlier by sampp 
as far as were concerned the first quarter had twice as many 
downgrades as upgrades lonski said last week 
kenneth c pfeil a senior vice president at sampp agreed that 
the timing of ratings changes was a factor in the differing 
interpretations of how debt fared in the first quarter 
another reason could be the subjective factor inherent in debt 
rating rating are not based entirely on hard numbers in part 
they reflect a judgment call on how a companys expected courses of 
action will affect its debt because of this variable the ratings 
of the two services can differ 
but pfeil added that he believes his firms firstquarter 
ratings picture is a fluke in an otherwise downward trend of 
corporate debt quality 
since 1982 he said there have been only three other quarters 
where sampps upgrades exceeded downgrades he said 
after this quarter well probably see the downgrades overtake 
the upgrades again i dont think weve broken the trend he said 
a companys debt rating is important because it can affect the 
price of the debt securities and the amount of interest a company 
must pay on new debt issues in order to entice investors to buy 
them 
for example when a companys debt rating drops it may find 
that it has to offer a higher interest rate on any new issues 
making them more expensive 
lonski said that though moodys believes the overall quality of 
corporate debt deteriorated in the first quarter it actually 
improved slightly from the last quarter of 1988 when moodys had 
57 downgrades to 25 upgrades for a downgradetoupgrade ratio of 
23 
about half the moodys downgrades in the first quarter reflected 
the continued concern by the credit rating companies about the 
effects of corporate takeovers and restructuring lonski said 
when one company takes over another through a leveraged buyout 
it typically takes on a huge chunk of debt from the loans and 
creditmarket issues needed to pay for the acquisition 
such debt raises concerns about the ability of the company to 
pay interest on its existing debt 
for example both ratings services downgraded the debt of rjr 
nabisco inc in the first quarter due to the 25 billion leveraged 
buyout of the atlantabased food and tobacco giant 
the other half of moodys ratings downgrades during the quarter 
reflect various factors such as increases in corporate debt due to 
other restructurings including stock buybacks lonski said 
lonski also wasnt optimistic about corporate credit quality 
improving in the near future he said he expects the wave of 
corporate takeovers and restructurings involving debt to continue 
we see no end to the situation he said

if you are willing to take the word of one 
veteran forecaster you can be confident that the economy wont 
slip into a recession this year 
the prophet in question is not some individual gifted with 
second sight rather it is the collective vision of countless 
investors as expressed by the stock market 
in recent history whenever a sustained business slump has 
occurred in 196970 197375 and 198182 stock prices fell for 
several months before clear signs of economic weakness appeared 
now despite all the talk on wall street about an economic 
slowdown in the face of rising inflation high interest rates and a 
long list of other worries stocks are holding their ground at or 
near their highest levels in a year and a half 
one of the best leading indicators we have of the economy the 
stock market is not forecasting a recession said jeffrey 
applegate at tucker anthony amp rl day inc 
there are plenty of skeptics who question the reliability of the 
market as an earlywarning system 
when stocks crashed in the fall of 1987 they note the dire 
events they seemed to be portending never came to pass that was by 
no means the first time that the market predicted a phantom event 
nevertheless analysts say it would be very unusual for a real 
recession to catch stock investors completely by surprise 
the market has held up incredibly well through a bunch of 
negatives which normally would have thrown stocks into the 
tank observed jay donnaruma at first albany corp in albany ny 
of course all this could change on very short notice most 
analysts readily acknowledge that there is plenty in the present 
business and economic picture to worry about 
consider the assignment facing the federal reserve clamp down 
on inflation but keep the economy moving ahead at a sustained 
pace all the while keeping the dollar stable in foreign exchange 
nevertheless stocks managed to post their third consecutive 
weekly gain in the past week the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 3226 to 233706 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 196 to 
16889 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 697 to 41768 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 523 at 33582 
volume on the big board averaged 14948 million shares a day 
against 15894 million the week before 
in the view of some analysts the stock markets steady showing 
is anything but reassuring they see it as a symptom of a troubling 
complacency manifesting itself in many areas of the financial world 
the junk bond market appears to be agreeing with the new 
wave economists that recessions are things of the past says 
raymond f devoe jr at legg mason wood walker inc 
virtually all of the 180 billion of outstanding junk has 
not weathered even one recession 
devoe says the low level of longterm interest rates in relation 
to shortterm rates also shows an incredible amount of optimism 
verging on complacency 
this would suggest that longterm investors are less concerned 
about inflation than the fed or are convinced that inflation 
worries have been exaggerated and the fed will be able to keep 
price indexes under control 
maybe maybe not however we remain a skeptic about any 
future governments ability to keep inflation below the 5 percent 
level which would appear to justify a 9 percent long treasury bond 
we remain extremely cautious about both the stock and bond 
markets

pinstriped lawyers and bankers worked 
frantically on two big deals within blocks of each other in lower 
manhattan feeling the deadline heat of an imminent triumph or 
defeat 
by the end of the week the proposed sale of eastern airlines 
had collapsed in failure while a longdelayed settlement of civil 
charges was reached between the government and drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
on the surface the two events had nothing to do with each other 
and shared more contrasts than similarities 
eastern is a moneylosing business that has come to symbolize 
airline deregulation at its worst and labormanagement feuding at 
its most intractable drexel is a roughandtumble moneymaking 
wall street powerhouse that incited the use of junk bonds to 
finance mergers crossed the bounds of illegality and agreed to pay 
for it 
but underneath the differences lie some common threads both the 
eastern and drexel stories are the outgrowth directly and 
indirectly of the 1980s debtfinanced takeover decade 
eastern boss frank lorenzo is a longtime drexel client who used 
its renowned prowess in highyield highrisk junkbond market to 
help him finance his texas air corp airline empire 
peter v ueberroth the former baseball boss and olympics 
organizer who offered to buy eastern for 464 million had planned 
to use drexels junkbond financing to complete the deal 
ueberroth even had kind words for michael milken the 
billionaire drexel banker who helped create the junkbond market 
and is now fighting criminal charges of securities fraud and 
racketeering that stem from a nearly 3yearold federal crusade 
against wall street corruption 
the charges facing milken are the same that drexel successfully 
dodged this past week via an unprecedented agreement negotiated 
with the securities and exchange commission that will effectively 
make the firm a governmentrun business for three years 
under terms of that pact which will enable drexel to plead 
guilty to six felonies and pay a 650 million criminal fine in a 
separate deal with the justice department the firm will banish 
milken and appoint as chairman a former sec chief who presided over 
the initial investigation into the firm in late 1986 
moreover drexel will cooperate with federal probes into other 
wall street crimes broadly restructure its business and let the 
sec supervise every aspect of its trading and financial structure 
the eastern and drexel stories share another common element that 
has yet to be played out their shrinking size and influence 
whether eastern is sold or kept by lorenzo it is bound to be 
much smaller and has been hardly missed in the competitive airline 
brawl already rival american airlines has moved aggressively into 
markets vacated by eastern and has expressed interest in buying 
some of its assets 
drexel though it remains a leader in the junkbond market has 
conceded losing hundreds of millions of dollars in business because 
of the federal fraud probe and now faces the prospect of competing 
as an admitted felon without the enormous clout wielded by milken 
exxon corp faced more criticism and a toughened government 
attitude over its handling of the nations largest oil spill from a 
grounded company tanker in the prince william sound of alaska 
federal officials took over the supervision of the disaster and 
ordered the oil giant to produce a detailed cleanup plan 
government statistics on the economy injected more confusion 
into the financial markets and the direction of interest rates 
the cost of money the trade deficit widened in february from a 
flood of imports implying more inflation and higher interest 
rates wholesale prices in march rose moderately suggesting 
inflation is easing business inventories rose in february and 
sales fell suggesting production cutbacks and an economic decline 
real and attempted takeovers swept the banking drug computer 
and chicken businesses banking company ncnb corp pressed its 
effort to buy citizens amp southern corp pharmaceutical giants 
smithkline beckman corp and beecham group plc of britain agreed to 
merge creating what would be the biggest drug company behind merck

as the channel one commercial news program for 
teens completes a test run this week geography teacher jim peters 
expects a planned series of reports on life in japan will command 
his class attention 
his seventh graders at eisenhower middle school in kansas city 
kan were captivated in early march with a channel one series on 
russian teenagers and paid more than usual interest to his lesson 
that week about the soviet union 
instead of some 40yearold geography teacher telling them 
what he saw when he went there the show allowed the kids to see 
something fresh for themselves every day he said 
peters expressed hope that the reports on japan will give an 
educational boost to this weeks lessons on that nation 
those are hopes shared by the channel one developers whittle 
communications lp which has visions of turning the test project 
into its biggest commercial venture yet by taking it national in 
the fall of 1990 
the knoxville tennbased media company has spent more than 
55 million on its channel one test that began running in six 
schools march 6 the costs including equipping each school with 
about 50000 in televisions and video equipment to receive the 
daily 12minutes news shows 
but whittle and school officials know that the project will not 
win much support nationally if they cant show it helps educate 
youngsters 
that is one of the reasons that in each of the five weeks of the 
test whittle sent teachers a course guide with suggested exercises 
based on that weeks program 
even as the 25th and last show signs off this friday whittles 
task of evaluating whether the project should be expanded has only 
begun 
ed winter the whittle executive who has overseen the 
development of channel one said that decision wont be made until 
midsummer 
before that he plans intensive talks with administrators 
teachers parents and students at each of the six schools in the 
test in addition to kansas city the schools are in cerritos 
calif knoxville tenn cincinnati billerica mass and detroit 
he will also be evaluating research designed to determine if the 
program significantly improved students knowledge of current 
events 
tests will have been given to students at each of the test 
schools as well as their sister schools which did not see the show 
researchers have also interviewed students on behalf of the 
seven advertisers who bought part of the two minutes a day of 
commercials carried on the show 
the commercial involvement that has seen companies pitch jeans 
chewing gum deodorant and candy to an audience of 10000 teens has 
drawn fierce attacks from childrens advocates and educators 
including the national parentteachers association 
patricia albjerg graham dean of the harvard school of education 
in cambridge mass said school officials should not be fooled 
about whittles basic intentions whittle is doing this to make 
money she said 
she said there is a potential danger in programs such as channel 
one for teachers to feel they can trim their lesson plans because a 
topic may have already been covered on the news show 
the danger is that youll give them this icing on the cake and 
never get on with the nutritious carbohydrates and the meat she 
said 
she said while the test has probably done no harm to the 
students and may have boosted their awareness of current events 
she said a longterm commitment to such programs could have 
unfortunate consequences 
since students are required by law to attend school and schools 
are hitting them with commerciallysponsored tv programs she said 
some students may conclude it is just as important to eat a certain 
kind of fast food as it is to learn arithmetic 
that is a subliminal message that is very bad for our 
children she said

the good news is the trade deficit eventually 
will shrink the bad news is why 
the next recession which may come next year will cause a 
short sharp and temporary improvement in the trade gap by 
decreasing american demand for imported goods economists say 
increased foreign ownership of american factories also will 
shrink the deficit thats because foreign companies will supply 
the american market from factories here instead of by shipments 
from abroad 
a decline in the value of the dollar will make the deficit 
smaller but a cheaper dollar means americans money is worth less 
in world markets and foreigners can buy us assets at bargain 
prices 
managed trade is touted in washington as a way to close the 
trade gap but managing trade usually involves restricting or 
taxing imports which hurts people who buy things like 
videocassette recorders 
in summary the four main factors that should eventually narrow 
the trade deficit recession foreign ownership a cheaper dollar 
and trade policy all carry big negatives 
there is no free lunch theres no solution thats going to 
make everybody happy jeff faux president of the economic policy 
institute in washington said last week 
the trade deficit has a good side it means americans are 
consuming goods and services from abroad without being required to 
pay for them with an equal amount of goods and services created in 
the united states 
but the foreigners are accumulating ious and persistent trade 
deficits have turned the united states into the worlds largest 
debtor 
the stubbornness of the deficit was obvious last friday when the 
commerce department reported that marchs deficit had jumped 209 
percent to 105 billion 
a fresh decline in the dollar undoubtedly would help shrink the 
deficit somewhat but us policymakers are too aware of the good 
news bad news tradeoffs to favor sharp depreciation 
the american economy already running near full capacity could 
go into inflationary overheating if a dollar drop did stimulate 
exports dramatically higherpriced imports would also add to 
inflation 
moreover a cheaper dollar would make it even easier for 
japanese german british and canadian companies to buy american 
assets ranging from treasury bonds to hotels and factories 
i have some japanese clients who are very eager to have the 
yen go higher because they want to transplant to the united states 
and they want to do it cheaper said harald malmgren an economic 
consultant in washington 
malmgren said he was convinced that american imports of cars 
from japan will virtually cease within three years because of north 
american production by the japanese automakers the us plants 
will even export cars to europe latin america and japan 
the good news on trade is bad news for detroit the big three 
automakers will have a hard time competing with the modern us 
factories of honda nissan toyota and the rest 
one neglected cause of the trade deficit is the durable demand 
for dollars by foreign central banks which use the us currency 
the way they once used gold as a reserve to back their own 
currencies 
the dollars that americans spend on foreign goods are finding 
their way into the vaults of foreign central banks instead of 
coming back to the united states through purchases of american 
goods 
a trade deficit is thus the unavoidable consequence of the 
appetite for dollars by foreign central banks said john mueller 
chief economist of bell mueller cannon inc 
the good side of that bad news is that the ious held by the 
foreign banks may never be cashed in mueller said in effect 
they are permanent holders of dollars they will be permanent 
loans

billionaire hotelier jay pritzker resurfaced 
friday with a proposal to buy strikecrippled eastern airlines 
sources said reviving the chance of a sale following the collapse 
of a deal with exbaseball boss peter ueberroths investor group 
ueberroth himself was said to be still interested in reviving 
his own bid for the airline and takeover speculator carl icahn 
plans to discuss a possible deal with union representatives this 
weekend the sources said 
right now is a good time for the pot to boil said one of 
the sources who were close to the situation but spoke on condition 
they not be identified 
they said the pritzker proposal essentially mirrored a bid he 
made before the ueberroth deal was announced april 6 the value of 
the pritzker offer wasnt clear but based on his earlier offer 
would be worth about 500 million 
pritzkers representatives presented what they described as an 
exploratory proposal friday to a meeting of the 15member eastern 
creditors committee in manhattan the sources said 
it called for pritzker to buy easterns fleet of around 250 
planes for an unspecified cash payment and lease them back to 
eastern the sources said 
in addition pritkzer would pay eastern around 100 million 
cash receive all easterns stock except for an unspecified share 
to be owned by its unions and forgive 185 million owed to eastern 
by its parent texas air corp the sources said 
pritzker did not return telephone calls to his chicago office 
and texas air aides declined to comment on the latest chapter of a 
tortuous effort to peddle the nations seventh largest airline 
which has been mired in a bitter strike and bankruptcycourt mess 
for more than a month 
texas air officials said after the ueberroth deal failed that 
they intended to restructure eastern as a smaller airline with 
about half its prestrike workforce and flight schedule 
but potential suitors may have been prodded to keep their feet 
in the door by a federal judges order on wednesday issued shortly 
after ueberroth formally withdrew his offer 
the former baseball commissioners deal fell through because of 
an intractable dispute between the unions and texas air boss frank 
lorenzo over whether a courtappointed trustee should run 
miamibased eastern until ueberroths group could assume control 
with his order us bankruptcy judge burton lifland moved to 
lure other buyers raising the possibility of an auction 
supervised by his court 
lifland overseeing easterns chapter 11 reorganization ordered 
the parties in the case to explain on monday why he shouldnt 
invite other bids for eastern that would include major assets it 
owned before lorenzo bought the airline in 1986 
charles e bryan the leader of easterns machinists said 
friday he remained confident that the airline will fly under a new 
owner and he noted that ueberroth shouldnt be ruled out as a 
candidate 
it will be resolved thats my prediction bryan said in an 
interview there are several other credible buyers 
in addition to ueberroth bryan would identify only icahn bryan 
said he was late for a speech friday in fort lauderdale fla 
because he was returning a phone call from ueberroth 
bryan declined to discuss the conversation but said he 
considers the former olympics organizer still a player 
ueberroth said thursday that he had not been in touch with any 
of the parties involved including lorenzo texas air and 
bankruptcy court officials he would not try to get in touch with 
them and did not expect to hear from them ueberroth told a 
reporter after a speech in new york
