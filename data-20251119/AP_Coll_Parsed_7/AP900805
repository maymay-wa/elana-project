president bush said sunday that iraq lied 
once again and reneged on its pledge to pull its invading forces 
out of kuwait angry and forceful the president again condemned 
iraqs aggression and said this will not stand 
bush dispatched secretary dick cheney to saudi arabia to confer 
with leaders of the desert kingdom administration sources said 
bush conferred sunday evening for 1 hours at the white house 
with his top civilian and military advisers including secretary of 
state james a baker iii and gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff 
they reviewed the situation in the gulf said white house 
spokesman doug davidson he would not elaborate 
bush turned aside reporters questions about whether turkey or 
saudi arabia would shut off pipelines critical to iraqs oil 
distribution and he refused to discuss any military action the 
united states might be planning 
im not going to discuss what were doing in terms of moving 
of forces anything of that nature he said 
the washington post reported in its monday editions that the 
us contingency planning includes planning to destabilize and 
eventually topple saddam from power 
the account attributed to unidentified sources said it could 
not be learned what timetable bush has set for making decisions 
about how to implement such a campaign 
we dont comment on options or intelligence matters said 
davidson in response to the account 
bush said he would meet monday at the white house with nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner and british prime minister 
margaret thatcher on her way home from aspen colo 
speaking on condition of anonymity an administration source 
said it hadnt been determined whether cheney will visit only 
ryadh the saudi capital or other mideast nations as well 
bush praised japans decision to join an international boycott 
of oil from iraq and kuwait and said he planned to speak again 
with turkish president turgut ozal as part of the intensive 
diplomatic activity around the world 
he said he had offered kuwaits emir now in exile certain 
assurances in a telephone conversation on saturday 
bush said his goal is to isolate iraqi leader saddam hussein 
the united states swiftly imposed an economic boycott on iraq after 
its lightning invasion of kuwait last wednesday and bush has spent 
much of his time since then urging other nations to join in 
pressuring baghdad economically 
these are outlaws international outlaws and renegades he 
said of the iraqi leadership 
there seems to be a united front out there that says iraq 
having committed brutal naked aggression ought to get out and 
this concept of their installing some puppet leaving behind will 
not be acceptable the president said 
bush was clearly agitated cutting short reporters questions at 
times and speaking in terse sentences he ended the impromptu news 
conference with these words 
this will not stand he said this will not stand this 
aggression against kuwait 
bush said he considered his options wide open he was asked 
whether turkey and saudi arabia would shut off the oil pipelines 
that provide a critical outlet for iraqis oil 
there is a strong feeling on the part of the nato countries to 
whom ive talked turkey being one of them that we must have 
concerted action to isolate iraq economically and you can just 
assume from there that those matters are being considered he 
said 
bush said the iraqis had not pulled back their invading forces 
as they promised friday they would the iraqis lied once again 
they said they were going to start moving out today and there is no 
evidence theyre moving out he said 
i want to see the arab states join the rest of the world in 
condemning this outrage and doing what they can to get saddam 
hussein out said bush 
asked about jordan king husseins defense of the iraqi ruler 
bush said i am disappointed to find any comment by anyone that 
apologizes or appears to condone whats taken place 
jordans monarch said saturday that other arab states were 
premature in condemning the iraqi invasion he called iraqs 
ruler a patriotic man who believes in his nation and its future 
and in establishing ties with others on the basis of mutual 
respect 
arab leaders have warned against foreign intervention but an 
emergency arab league summit to discuss the crisis initially 
planned for sunday in saudi arabia was postponed 
bush said an arab leader that i respect enormously told him 
friday they needed 48 hours to find what they called an arab 
solution that obviously has failed of course im 
disappointed 
jordans prime minister mudar badran said his natin will not 
recognize the new government because that would hinder arab efforts 
to end the conflict 
asked how he would prevent the iraqis from installing its new 
government bush snapped just wait watch and learn 
he also said the iraqiinstalled government in kuwait would gain 
little recognition internationally 
there is no intention on the part of any of these countries to 
accept a puppet government and that signal is going out loud and 
clear to iraq he said

contractors sprayed oileating bacteria 
on marshes sunday while crews vacuumed up heavy sludge that drifted 
northward from a spill of up to 700000 gallons of oil 
ships were allowed to leave the harbor for the first time in 
more than a week 
coast guard capt thomas greene said wind pushed a slick of oil 
surrounding houston point and its sensitive marshes back into 
galveston bay on sunday some of the oil washed ashore while 
streamers of up to 100 yards in length moved northeast toward 
trinity bay a marine area 
approximately 315000 gallons of the refinery oil from the 
bargetanker collision had been collected by sunday afternoon 
greene said 
about 150 contract workers and 90 coast guardsmen were working 
on the cleanup which will cost about 5 million greene said 
the oil was spilled july 28 when the greek tanker shinoussa 
collided with two barges under tow by the chandy n in the houston 
ship channel 
traffic is moving just not freely said scott inbody chief 
warrant officer of the coast guards vessel traffic service in 
houston were making sure no vessels meet or overtake each other 
in the waters near the accident 
the ship channel was opened to inbound towboat traffic friday 
it had been closed since the accident while the coast guard worked 
to free the barge that had partially sunk in the collision 
the coast guard hoped to open the channel to unrestricted 
twoway traffic by monday inbody said 
we have outbound ships and inbound towboats pulling or 
pushing barges moving right now he said about 40 vessels were 
waiting to get into the channel and 10 were waiting to leave late 
sunday the coast guard said 
at a hearing on collision sunday shinoussa crewmen blamed the 
houston pilot who guided them through the channel for bad 
directions the pilot contends the helmsman failed to follow 
instructions and steered into the oncoming barges after another 
ship passed 
state officials planned to spread about 150 pounds of the 
bacteria around houston point and its marshes sunday the microbes 
which occur naturally in small amounts are bred to reduce oil to a 
fatty substance that sinks and can be eaten by fish 
when the oil is gone the microbes die the process is called 
bioremediation 
weve got oil about 30 feet into the marshlands texas water 
commission chairman bj buck wynne said sunday were trying 
to do as much as we can today 
wynne said bacteria used on pelican island last week seems to 
have been beneficial but tests have not been completed 
this is different from oil on rocks or oil in open waters 
wynne said this is on a living organic system and its 
absolutely the most sensitive place it can be 
dead crabs mussels and other small marine animals have been 
found on the shore around houston point said larry mckinney 
director of the resource protection division of the texas parks and 
wildlife department 
a ban on shrimping in galveston bay continued sunday but fin 
fishing remained open

liberians have long hoped that the 
hundreds of us marines who swooped into monrovia on sunday to 
rescue americans and shore up embassy defenses would also help end 
their civil war 
besieged president samuel doe liberias council of churches and 
rebel leader prince johnson all have called on the united states to 
use force to help end the conflict a total of 5000 people mostly 
civilians have been killed 
johnsons threat saturday to start detaining foreigners in the 
hope of provoking foreign intervention brought the order to 
dispatch the marines to monrovia 
the marines returned to their ships with 62 americans and 12 
people from other countries leaving behind a group of soldiers to 
shore up embassy defenses 
the united states has insisted it will not intervene to end the 
7monthlong war but many liberians have hoped for more 
when the warships carrying the marines first arrived off the 
liberian coast two months ago people danced in the streets of the 
capital singing of how the soldiers would save them 
but the marines remained offshore and last week johnson asked 
reporters why does the united states not come to the aid of 
liberia which looks on america as its motherland his puzzlement 
is shared by many people in this west african nation that was 
founded by freed american slaves in 1847 
johnson said he appealed last week to the us embassy for 
american help to stop the killing of civilians but was told that 
the crisis was an internal conflict 
as though the united states had never interfered in the 
affairs of other people like those of grenada the philippines or 
panama johnson argued 
appeals for us intervention mounted after early hopes that the 
men of rival rebel leader charles taylor would quickly take 
monrovia were dashed 
doe remains inside his presidential mansion protected by 
loyalist troops while johnson and taylors forces once united 
have clashed with each other as the siege of monrovia continues 
in june thousands of peace marchers led by christian and moslem 
leaders ignored death threats from doe and demanded us 
intervention 
we are appealing to the congress to the government and to the 
people of the united states of america to come to our aid this is 
an sos call save our souls appealed one of the leaders bishop 
w nah dixon when marchers stopped outside the us embassy 
hundreds of the protesters waving banners reading stop the 
killings came from a refugee center set up at st peters 
lutheran church on july 30 does soldiers massacred more than 600 
people who sought refuge at that church 
many liberians blame the united states in part for the present 
conflict pointing to the 500 million washington pumped into the 
country to support doe after he seized power in a bloody 1980 coup 
us aid continued to pour in despite reports that doe rigged 
the 1985 elections and allegations of massive government corruption 
lethal military aid was suspended in 1986 after does soldiers 
massacred more than 2000 civilians to put down a rebellion but 
us military advisers remained until last month when doe accused 
them of supporting the rebels and ordered them out of the country 
many of taylors soldiers joined the rebellion to avenge family 
members killed by does soldiers 
the rebellion began in december when taylors forces invaded 
from ivory coast accusing doe of corruption and human rights 
abuses

the catholic archdiocese announced saturday that 
a priest had resigned because of a relationship with the same woman 
whose intimate ties with archbishop eugene marino forced him to 
step down last month 
the woman 27yearold vicki r long sued the church for 
paternity payments stemming from her alleged relationship with a 
third priest the church is paying child support but denies the 
priest is the father 
the rev michael woods pastor at st judes catholic church in 
sandy springs an atlanta suburb offered to resign saturday after 
confessing to an intimate relationship with ms long a riverdale 
lay minister said bishop james lyke acting administrator of the 
atlanta archdiocese 
it wasnt known if the church had accepted woods resignation 
the bishop said woods used an undisclosed amount of parish funds 
to help ms long in a statement read to his congregation by an 
archdiocese spokesman woods said his relationship with ms long 
has ended but did not say how long when it had begun 
marino who originally claimed health reasons for his departure 
last month had a twoyear relationship with ms long church 
officials said last week 
lyke has refused to say whether marinos relationship with ms 
long was sexual calling it intimate marino last known to be 
recuperating in new york has not commented publicly 
ms long has charged that another priest rev donal keohane of 
columbus ga fathered her daughter born in 1986 blood tests 
concluded he was not the father 
experts say the resignation of marino the nations 
highestranking black catholic will heighten debate over mandatory 
celibacy a church law adopted in the middle ages partly to curb 
corruption and nepotism in the church 
celibacy is unrealistic and its counterproductive now said 
richard mcbrien theology chairman at the university of notre dame 
the priesthood as weve known it is falling apart because of 
a stubborn refusal to change 
pope john paul ii strongly supports the celibacy requirement 
during his 1987 visit to the united states he said a priests love 
for christ must be paramount and is at the foundation of our 
commitment to celibacy this love also makes it possible for us as 
servants of gods kingdom to love our people freely and chastely 
and deeply 
mcbrien noted that there are increasingly fewer qualified 
priests in this country about 15 percent of priests have left the 
order since 1970 and officials expect applications for seminary to 
decline 40 percent by the year 2000 
the rev terrence dosh national coordinator for corpus a 
support group for married expriests said marinos stature draws 
attention to a worldwide disregard for celibacy 
in the past 25 years 19000 american roman catholic priests 
resigned and married and 110000 in the world resigned and married 
it takes the situation of a bishop to draw attention to it he 
said 
dosh said scholars believe mandatory celibacy has its roots in 
the old testament call for ritual purity women were believed 
impure so priests were forbidden to have sexual intercourse the 
night before celebrating eucharist in 1139 mandatory celibacy was 
adopted 
celibacy is quintessentially antiwoman he said 
cathy grenier of good tidings a pennsylvania support group for 
women and priests said celibacy is a feminist issue 
the attitude toward women is that if a priest touches a woman 
hes tainted said mrs grenier who married a priest if women 
were not believed inherently evil and dirty thered be no problem 
with marrying us 
mcbrien said he believed mandatory celibacy would be stopped 
but perhaps in a long and bloody manner 
ask a random sample of catholics whether they are impressed 
with the fact that priests dont marry if it makes them more of a 
spiritually credible person most would say no just the 
opposite he said

hundreds of army troops on saturday 
evicted about 4000 striking workers who occupied the usowned 
chiquita banana packing plant for 41 days in a northern town 
clashes were reported 
at least two workers were wounded by gunfire and two others were 
beaten when the army evicted workers from the installations in la 
lima 180 miles north of tegucigalpa said union spokesman 
alejandro maldonado 
a military intelligence source said at least two workers and one 
unidentified person were wounded

the 600 troops also occupied la lima and the government 
announced that the chiquita brands which produces and exports most 
of honduras banana crop could hire new employees and resume

earlier saturday the company rejected a proposed 30 percent pay 
increase for the workers who began their strike june 25 
about 4000 of the 10000 striking workers had peacefully 
occupied chiquita offices workshops and packing and cleaning 
installations during the strike 
the other 6000 had remained behind closed gates in about 80 
camps where they live around the installations troops did not 
enter the camps 
la lima has been occupied by the armed forces the military 
source said the situation in la lima is tense but there has 
been no armed response from the workers 
he said troops had removed the strikers and remained in the main 
installations on sunday he said a military operation would begin 
in all the banana camps to definitely reestablish order in that 
sector 
about 300 soldiers arrived in trucks and quickly occupied the 
installations they were reinforced by 300 more soldiers and 
police the source said 
labor minister rodolfo rosales abella speaking on national 
radio and television said president rafael leonardo callejas and 
his cabinet decided to end the strike 
the government guarantees the right to work of all employees 
of the company union members or not who desire to renew their 
labor rosales said 
the government also guarantees the right of chiquita brand to 
contract the necessary personnel for its normal operation he 
said 
the strike constituted a threat to the social and economic 
stability of the country he said cincinnatibased chiquita 
brand produces and exports 60 percent of honduras bananas the 
countrys main export 
karl f koch general manager of chiquita brand international in 
honduras told the associated press on saturday that his company 
absolutely rejects the new salary demand of 30 percent for the 
workers 
the strikers friday rejected a july 28 proposal by the nations 
president for a 25 percent raise which would have been acceptable 
to the company 
instead they demanded a raise of 30 percent earlier they had 
asked for a 60 percent increase over the 246amonth minimum 
salary 
groups representing 600000 workers and peasants had threatened 
to launch a general strike monday if the strike is not solved

china will not sell arms to iraq the official 
xinhua news agency said sunday joining other nations cutting off 
trade with the baghdad government after the invasion of kuwait 
xinhua quoted an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman as 
saying that since china supported the un security council 
resolution condemning iraqs invasion of kuwait it would 
naturally not sell arms to iraq under such circumstances 
the brief report did not elaborate on the ministry officials 
comment which it said was in response to a reporters question on 
whether china would embargo arms sales to iraq after thursdays 
invasion 
in the past china has officially denied selling arms to iraq

a moderate earthquake shook the 
santa cruz mountains on saturday night but no injuries were 
reported 
the us geological survey reported the 1152 pm temblor 
measured 43 on the richter scale and was centered near the town of 
san juan bautista about 75 miles southeast of san francisco 
it was just enough to rattle things and make the pots swing 
but it seemed very small said linda parker a clerk with the 
salinas police department 
the temblor served as another reminder for northern california 
residents of the deadly oct 17 1989 earthquake in the san 
francisco bay area that measured 71 on the richter scale killed 
67 people and caused billions of dollars in damage 
quakes of magnitude 4 to 5 are considered moderate and could 
cause some minor damage such as broken china and cracks in poorly 
built structures

the radio of kuwaits new iraqiinstalled 
government claimed that iraqi troops began pulling out of kuwait on 
sunday but the united states said it doubted a withdrawal was 
really under way 
the radio announcement came three days after iraq invaded kuwait 
and one day after baghdad said it had replaced the oilrich 
kingdoms ousted monarchy with a new government made up of nine 
kuwaiti army offices 
iraq also said saturday that it was creating a new kuwaiti army 
and that 100000 iraqis the approximate number of soldiers baghdad 
took over kuwait with had volunteered for the new military force 
in other developments 
the white house continued to seek the immediate and 
unconditional withdrawl of all iraqi troops and it thanked the 
many nations who have condemned the invasion and imposed economic 
sanctions on baghdad 
after several days of debate japan on sunday banned all oil 
imports from iraq and kuwait and halted japanese exports to both 
countries tokyo said it would suspend all loans to iraq and 
kuwait ban japanese investment there and freeze iraqi assets in 
japan japan which imports 99 percent of its oil had relied on 
iraq and kuwait for more than 11 percent of its oil imports the 
white house hailed japans move and said prime minister toshiki 
kaifu called president bush on sunday at camp david to inform him 
about the sanctions 
although tens of thousands of iraqi troops reportedly remained 
massed near kuwaits border with saudi arabia washington said on 
sunday there was no indication that any soldiers had moved into 
saudi arabia 
the white house said that 11 american oil workers rounded up 
after the invasion had been brought to baghdad talked with us 
embassy officials and were in good shape it said that accounts 
for all missing americans 
an unconfirmed report said a warplane from the deposed emirs 
air force in kuwait bombed an iraqi military headquarters near 
kuwait city it was not clear where the plane came from or whether 
its reported attack caused any damage 
the radio of kuwaits new government monitored in bahrain 
quoted its military correspondent as saying the pullout began 
at 8 am 1 am edt 
iraqi president saddam hussein allowed reporters based in 
baghdad to be taken south to basra overnight to observe the first 
iraqi troops return home 
but at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said on 
sunday morning we have no independent or confirmable information 
on this report of the withdrawl beginning saddam husseins 
actions in the past have raised serious skepticism about his 
intentions 
iraq declared earlier that the provisional government installed 
by baghdad is capable of ensuring security in the occupied country 
baghdad television has said the new government is headed by col 
ala hussein ali and that he holds the positions of prime minister 
commanderinchief of the armed forces minister of defense and 
interior minister the other eight members were lieutenant colonels 
and majors 
but kuwaits embassy in amman jordan on sunday dismissed the 
new government as a list of fake names and said ali is saddams 
soninlaw 
a similar report appeared in one of cairos leading newspapers 
alahram it quoted the kuwait embassy in tunis which said that ali 
works with saddams administration in baghdad 
the iraqi news agency carried a kuwaitdatelined statement it 
said was from the provisional government denying any of its 
members were iraqis 
in jordan prime minister mudar badran said his nation will not 
recognize the new government because that would hinder arab efforts 
to end the conflict 
us french and british warships meanwhile steamed toward the 
persian gulf president bush said friday that if iraq moved against 
saudi arabia it would be attacking us vital interests on 
saturday bush said in washington that the use of force in 
resolving the crisis remains an option saudi arabia ships 12 
million barrels of oil to the united states daily 
fitzwater said on sunday that there was no indication iraqi 
forces had moved into saudi arabia even though tens of thousands 
of them have been reported to be within 5 to 10 miles of the saudi 
border 
in washington iraqi ambassador mohammed almashat on saturday 
denied us and other foreign reports suggesting that iraq plans to 
invade saudi arabia 
saddam ordered the invasion of kuwait after accusing it of 
stealing oil from a field that straddles their disputed border he 
also blamed kuwait for a fall in oil prices that cost iraq 14 
billion saying it contributed to the oil glut by cheating on its 
opec oil cartel production quotas

the white house expressed serious 
skepticism sunday over claims that iraq was pulling its invading 
forces out of kuwait 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater also said there was 
no indication that iraqi forces had moved into saudi arabia even 
though they were within 5 to 10 miles of the saudi border 
president bush spending the weekend at camp david consulted by 
telephone with saudi king fahd turkish president turgut ozal the 
emir of kuwait and canadian prime minister brian mulroney on 
saturday 
the united states continues to seek the immediate complete 
and unconditional withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait and 
restoration of a legitimate government of that country fitzwater 
said 
we continue to consider all options in accordance with that 
policy 
the radio of the iraqibacked kuwaiti government said iraqi 
troops began pulling out of the oilrich country sunday three days 
after they were ordered to invade by iraqi president saddam hussein 
at the white house fitzwater said we have no independent or 
confirmable information on this report 
saddam husseins actions in the past have raised serious 
skepticism about his intentions the white house spokesman said 
he declined comment on reports that jordans king hussein had 
defended iraqs president 
were in the process of trying to work out a solution here and 
it does no good serves no useful purpose to try to characterize 
individual actions fitzwater said 
as to a report in the washington post that special operations 
forces and hostage rescue forces have already been dispatched to 
the mideast and that contingency plans call for sending stealth 
fighters and b52 bombers fitzwater said i cant comment on any 
specific military actions or movements 
reporting on the status of missing us citizens fitzwater 
confirmed that 11 american oil workers rounded up after the 
invasion had been brought to baghdad he said they had talked with 
us embassy officials 
they appear to be in good shape and this accounts for all 
missing americans fitzwater said they are safe and pursuing 
courses of their own free will 
one possible avenue of applying pressure against iraq would be 
to close down the pipelines in turkey and saudi arabia through 
which most of iraqis oil flows 
clearly they are part of the equation fitzwater said 
when asked if ozal or fahd had made a commitment to close the 
pipelines fitzwater said we cant comment on specific actions 
or agreements that have been reached in terms of private 
conversations 
he added im not prepared to comment on any conclusions that 
they may have reached at this time fitzwater said the pipelines 
apparently are still open 
fitzwater discussed developments in the middle east at an 
earlymorning white house briefing where he announced that 225 
marines had been sent into liberia to evacuate americans and 
protect the us embassy there from the countrys civil war 
asked if the us action in liberia carried a message to saddam 
fitzwater said i wouldnt link the two there really is no 
relationship between these actions in two separate parts of the 
world 
it does of course point up that president bush is extremely 
concerned about the welfare of american citizens fitzwater said 
we have acted time and again on behalf of their safety im 
sure that iraq and other countries are aware of that 
fitzwater said the united states was continuing to encourage 
other nations to freeze iraqi assets and to institute economic 
sanctions against baghdad the united states also is urging a 
freeze on kuwaiti assets to keep them away from iraq 
arab leaders have warned against foreign intervention and have 
sought a diplomatic solution but an emergency arab league summit 
to discuss the crisis initially planned for sunday in saudi arabia 
was postponed 
asked if the delay constituted a setback fitzwater said its 
difficult to know the timing is a question for them to consider 
we dont know all of the criteria or concerns that they had about 
holding the meeting versus at some later point so its just 
impossible to say

holding the annual convention of overeaters 
anonymous in this city of rich food might seem like too much 
temptation but for those attending it was more like a testimonial 
to the program 
we recognize the irony and some of the temptations it 
presents said jorge sever executive director of overeaters 
anonymous we arent worried about it however 
a week after the chefs of the american culinary federation 
staged their 1990 culinary mardi gras overeaters anonymous 
gathered this weekend to celebrate the groups 30 years of helping 
people recover from compulsive overeating 
it is ironic but its really neat in a way it points out 
that our program isnt just about food its about how were living 
our lives said kathy who has been involved in oa for 10 years 
kathy who like most members of the organization doesnt reveal 
her last name said she weighed 218 pounds when she joined oa she 
now weighs 125 though shes lived in this capital of cookery for 
two years 
if youre fit emotionally and spiritually and every other way 
you eat to enjoy it not because you have to said kathy new 
orleans is known for its food and its restaurants im sure some of 
our members will really enjoy it others will avoid it we all have 
to do whats right for us 
organizers said 1500 people from all over the world registered 
for the convention and its nearly 40 meetings and workshops 
overeaters anonymous is divided into nine regions nationally 
said annette mambuca the groups publications editor the 
conventions are rotated among the regions 
when the southeastern regions turn came new orleans was 
selected strictly on the convention facilities and the appeal 
it would have for our members ms mambuca said 
oa isnt the first group finding itself in conflict with new 
orleans rich food tradition in march 24000 heart doctors 
gathered for the american college of cardiologys convention and 
new orleansstyle banquet menus had to be modified to reduce 
cholesterol levels 
overeaters anonymous which was started in january 1960 in los 
angeles is patterned after the alcoholics anonymous program 
the program is not really a diet club sever said we 
dont provide a food plan or anything like that for our members we 
offer support we share in some of their griefs and in their joy of 
recovery some people feel they need some type of regimentation in 
that case we tell them to see a doctor or a dietitian 
oa does not charge fees or dues most groups take up a 
collection at meetings to cover expenses the organization doesnt 
solicit or accept outside contributions 
ill never graduate from oa kathy said initially i went 
to lose weight i stick around because of the spiritual and 
emotional growth

the army is stepping up its distribution of gas 
masks to civilians following iraqs invasion of kuwait israeli 
media reported sunday 
an army spokesman confirmed that soldiers have been distributing 
protective equipment against a possible chemical weapons attack but 
denied the move was linked to the invasion 
in april iraqi president saddam hussein threatened to scorch 
half of israel with poison gas if his country were attacked the 
israeli military began an experimnetal distribution of gas masks 
shortly following saddams threat 
the distribution of gas masks is part of a plan enacted 
several months ago and will continue until all residents in israel 
hear explanations of what chemical warfare is the spokesman 
said he spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with military 
regulations 
he said a mass distribution effort was being considered but 
added that no concrete decisions were made since thursdays 
invasion by iraq 
but the leftwing al hamishmar newspaper reported that gas masks 
would be distributed to hundreds of thousands of homes by the 
years end 
the haaretz daily said in a frontpage story sunday that army 
officers met secretly this weekend and decided to distribute gas 
masks in the tel aviv metropolitan area 
that region the most densely populated in israel is home to 
about 19 million of the countrys 45 million people 
it also reported that the army planned to start marketing 
videotapes explaining how to use the equipment 
this past year an experimental distribution of gas masks was 
conducted in two cities ramat hasharon north of tel aviv and 
sefad in northern israels galilee 
about halfamillion pupils in the nations 2200 schools were 
also taught how to use special antigas kits 
israel widely issued gas masks on a trial basis in 1979 but 
stopped the practice after it was discovered that the equipment was 
often used at masquerade parties and while painting cars 
but israelis began taking the issue more seriously after 
widespread allegations that iraq used poison gas against its 
kurdish minority during the eightyear iraniraq war that ended in 
1988 
iraq is one of four arab countries believed to have chemical 
weapons and possessed mediumrange missiles egypt syria and 
libya are also believed to have chemical weapons 
israeli leaders meanwhile said they were closely following the 
military developments in kuwait 
defense minister moshe arens said he saw no need for israel to 
intervene in the conflict but added that if iraq sent troops into 
neighboring jordan this would change the geostrategic situation 
for israel and would require action on our part

visit to indonesia and singapore seeking to enhance chinas 
influence in the region 
long ostracized by the west for its violent suppression of 
prodemocracy protests and bypassed by the democratic revolutions 
that shook its socialist allies china has sought to exert more 
influence in its traditional sphere of influence western diplomats 
say 
chinas aspirations have been encouraged by us plans to reduce 
its military profile in the region said the diplomats who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
beijing is anxious to counterbalance us and japanese 
influence in the region said one diplomat 
another diplomat added china sees itself as the 
preeminent power in southeast asia and the preeminent cultural 
force it decided it would be best to work on relations close to 
home 
by securing normal ties with indonesia and singapore beijing 
has also scored a diplomatic coup against taiwan which it regards 
as a renegade province 
while none of chinas neighbors would accept a chinese military 
presence on their territory some are welcoming closer diplomatic 
ties 
china and indonesia are set to resume normal diplomatic 
relations on aug 8 nearly 23 years after jakarta suspended ties 
with beijing after an abortive communist coup it blamed on chinese 
influence 
following indonesias lead singapore is expected to establish 
diplomatic relations with beijing before the end of the year 
both singapore and indonesia cited the promise of improved trade 
ties with asias most populous market as one reason for the 
rapprochement 
indonesias total trade with china has more than doubled from 
421 million to 918 million last year since the july 1985 
signing of a memorandum of understanding between the two countries 
chambers of commerce and industry 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas said he hopes to sign 
a new trade agreement during lis visit monday through friday

past decade singapore which is slightly larger than chicago is 
chinas fifthlargest export market much of it for reexport to 
other countries 
singaporean businessmen many of them ethnic chinese have been 
encouraged by their government to invest more in chinas 
manufacturing and tourism 
beijings decision to stop supporting antigovernment communist 
rebels in the region with the exception of the khmer rouge in 
cambodia has helped open the ways for better ties with neighboring 
states 
of the six members of association of southeast asian nations 
brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and 
thailand only the sultanate of brunei has not agreed to establish 
normal relations with beijing

of me and that was fine at the time ms swanson said in an 
interview with the des moines sunday register 
they lived together for four years married in 1984 and were

the cocaine and perjury trial of mayor marion 
barry has focused attention on race relations in the nations 
capital a city with a 70 percent black population and little 
recent history of racial strife 
i think that there is a perception with a substantial number 
of the population that he is being picked on unfairly said 
kenneth robinson a local attorney who consulted with barrys 
counsel 
robinson is white 
i think the barry trial is just another indication that people 
are very very sensitive to race and how people are treated said 
ethelbert miller a poet who teaches at howard university 
miller is black 
a us district court jury began deliberating the barry case 
thursday afternoon two members both men are white one of them 
has been chosen jury foreman 
barry admits that the trial has brought to the surface a 
simmering amount of polarization and racism that was already 
there 
some blacks agree with barrys claim that he was the target of 
overzealous white prosecutors others feel betrayed by the mayor 
who had claimed repeatedly that he didnt use drugs 
the majority of whites are just plain annoyed and angry and 
just want this guy to go dc councilman jim nathanson said 
before the trial began nathanson who is white represents a 
predominantly white district 
for all the talk about racial polarization barry is the one who 
was often credited with cooling the tempers that erupted after the 
assassination of martin luther king jr in 1968 ten people died 
1191 were reported injured and 7650 were arrested in the citys 
worst riots washington was then 63 percent black 
some black leaders jesse l jackson among them have suggested 
that the climate exists for a resurgence of racial violence in 
washington if barry is convicted 
barry himself said it will not those who would even talk 
about that dont represent me dont represent what i stand for 
he told reporters last week you obviously dont realize that we 
have grown as a people the last 20 years we will not destroy that 
which we have worked so hard to build up 
to equate this to the violence that would occur when a white 
man killed martin luther king is asinine robinson said people 
will talk about it in bars and on the street but i just dont 
believe that it is going to happen 
some of the noise that you hear is sort of par for the 
course said sam smith the white publisher of the progressive 
review a washington opinion journal its just that more people 
are paying attention to it now 
the presiding judge in the trial thomas penfield jackson is 
white one of the prosecutors assistant us attorney judith 
retchin is white the other assistant us attorney richard 
roberts is black barrys lawyer r kenneth mundy is black 
barry has called the case a political lynching and a case of 
satanic dirtlike tactics jackson called it part of an ugly 
pattern of white judicial leadership attacking black political 
leadership naacp executive director benjamin hooks voiced a 
similar complaint 
us attorney jay stephens said he believes in trying cases 
regardless of who the person is or what the political priorities 
are 
the mayor and his allies have also sharply criticized news media 
coverage of the case 
abdul alim muhammad a muslim who is running for congress in 
suburban prince georges county md said what we are 
witnessing in dc is like an electronic lynching in some 
respects the media are no better than the rednecked tobacco 
chewing members of the ku klux klan 
louis farrakhan leader of the nation of islam has shown his 
support for barry by attending the trial despite efforts by the 
judge to have him barred as potentially disruptive 
barry who broke into politics as a street organizer in the 
civil rights movement has been mayor for 12 years he is not 
seeking reelection and six candidates are running to succeed him 
when one of them city council chairman david clarke was 
introduced at a rally for black south african leader nelson 
mandela he was booed by members of the mostly black audience 
clarke is white 
although he still has a loyal following especially among poor 
blacks barry is increasingly viewed as an embarrassment by members 
of washingtons large black middle class 
longtime civil rights advocate and educator roger wilkins a 
past political supporter of the mayor wrote recently in the 
washington post marion barry used the elders and lied to the 
young he has manipulated thousands of others with his cynical use 
of charges of racism to defend his malodorous personal failures 
robert woodson president of the national center for 
neighborhood enterprise said barry has certainly created a 
racial situation out of something that i do not think was he is 
exploiting tensions and in some cases creating tensions that 
otherwise would not have existed woodson who is black was a 
member of a white house council on private sector initiatives in 
the reagan administration 
the rev james bevel a barry supporter who conducted prayer 
meetings in a tent outside the courthouse through much of the 
trial said it is not affecting basic race relationships or 
hostilities in black folks toward white people i dont see that in 
the people im around 
the rev a knighton stanley the black pastor of peoples 
congregational church said he avoids raising the issue of possible 
violence 
am i uneasy my answer is yes said stanley my judgment 
is we will not have it and my prayer is that my judgment is 
right

democratic economist charles schultze said 
sunday that iraqs invasion of oilrich kuwait could set off a 
mild recession in the united states 
but he said the situation would become far worse if iraqi power 
spreads and it comes to dominate world oil markets 
schultze who was chairman of the council of economic advisers 
during the carter administration said he did not expect severe oil 
and gasoline shortages of the type that developed in 1979 
he said he does expect higher energy prices 
the main thing we have to do is distinguish whats going on 
now which is bad for our economy and is going to raise oil prices 
and gasoline prices but is not going to be catastrophic 
schultze said 
but if iraq is let go and what could happen in the long run 
really happens then katy bar the door he said 
so short run this is not a big deal economically he said 
long run weve got real potential problems 
schultze made the comments on the abc television news program 
this week with david brinkley 
schultze said that if saddam hussein iraqs military ruler 
were to overrun not only kuwait but saudi arabia and the oilrich 
emirates along the persian gulf the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries or opec would move from being merely a cartel 
to really a controlling monopoly 
schultze said that before iraqi troops stormed across the border 
into kuwait the us domestic economy was probably on the edge of 
a recession 
we might have muddled through without one he said 
now he said my guess is that if nothing else happens it 
could kick over into a mild recession 
we wouldnt like it it would be costly he said but it 
wouldnt be huge 
but if in the longer run the opec oil supplies are really 
organized by one person then we could be in trouble in the long 
run seriously schultze said

signs were mounting sunday that social 
democrats in the two germanys the secondlargest party in both 
countries may push for a unified germany as early as this week 
horst ehmke deputy chairman of the west german social 
democrats reportedly suggested the east german social democrats 
may propose instant unity during a special parliamentary session 
this week 
asked by the newspaper bild whether the east german social 
democrats might make such a move during the wednesday session in 
east berlin ehmke reportedly replied i dont know i dont 
exclude it 
the social democratic parties in both germanys are in close 
consultation with one another 
the east german social democrats are part of prime minister 
lothar de maizieres broad coalition government the west german 
social democrats are the main opposition to chancellor helmut kohl 
on saturday the head of the west german social democrats 
hansjochen vogel said west germany would have to respect a 
decision by east germanys parliament for an early joining to 
the west before allgerman elections 
other west german social democrats have echoed that view in the 
past two days the move is most likely an effort to improve the 
partys chances of winning the leadership of a united germany when 
allgerman elections take place 
the social democrats apparent maneuvering comes as kohl presses 
to have allgerman elections moved up from dec 2 to oct 14 under 
that scheme formal unity would occur immediately before the vote 
kohls christian democrats want allgerman elections to take 
place quickly to avoid a potential loss of voter support if the 
east german economy collapses 
joblessness in east germany has climbed to more than 240000 
after the july 2 economic merger of the two germanys and is 
expected to move much higher 
social democrats are fighting to keep the elections from being 
moved up to oct 14 
but the social democrats now say they would accept actual 
unification much sooner because of east germanys economic problems 
that would allow them to be perceived as embracing a process 
they have tried to slow while still pushing for elections in 
december when the economic woes are expected to be much worse 
whether allgerman elections occur on dec 2 or oct 14 hinges 
on kohls ability to persuade the west german parliament to make a 
constitutional change necessary for the earlier date 
for that kohl needs a twothirds majority vote he cant manage 
without the social democrats 
oskar lafontaine kohls social democratic rival for the 
chancellorship of a united germany has vowed to block kohls plan 
kohl himself seemed to acknowledge that pushing the idea through 
west germanys parliament will be harder than expected 
kohls panicky proposal clearly shows that he sees his chances 
vanishing every day lafontaine told the sueddeutsche zeitung in 
a report released to other news media in advance of mondays 
publication 
seiters also announced that kohl and hansjochen vogel federal 
leader of the social democrats would meet on tuesday to try to 
reach agreement on the elections 
the proposal to move up the allgerman vote to oct 14 was made 
public friday by de maiziere following consultations with kohl

liberian rebels said they nearly 
fired on us military aircraft sunday during an evacuation 
operation because they had not been informed of the mission 
earlier sunday rebel leader charles taylor appealled to all 
liberians to oppose all foreign intervention and accused the 
us of a mounting new colonization drive but he made the 
comments before it was clear the us planes were on an evacuation 
mission 
more than 200 airborne us marines swept into liberia early 
sunday to evacuate americans after taylors rival prince johnson 
ordered the seizure of foreigners especially americans britons 
indians and lebanese on monday 
johnson said he hoped to provoke international intervention in 
the 7monthold tribal war targeted at liberian president samuel 
doe who remained holed up in his mansion in monrovia the capital 
doe on sunday welcomed the us operation saying it was needed 
to protect american lives in the past he has asked the 2100 
marines stationed offshore to help end the conflict 
tom woewiyu defense minister in taylors selfdeclared 
governmentinexile said the united states in the past has kept 
taylors rebels informed of its moves but this time said nothing 
we are protesting this woewiyu said the united states is 
trying to sneak around and do a wholly clandestine operation 
which only confuses the situation a situation where an accident 
will be caused and someone will blame us 
liberian rebels were just receiving orders to fire on the 
incoming us helicopters sunday when they found out about the 
operation woewiyu said 
he said the rebel order to fire was being sent by radio when a 
us transmission broke into the frequency identifying the aircraft 
as us planes 
once it was established the us aircraft were in monrovia for 
an evacuation and permission was given they landed and they have 
been doing the evacuation with our forces watching and there has 
been no incident woewiyu said 
in the confusion during the evacuation taylor broadcast an 
appeal over radio calling for a mass mobilization by liberians to 
defend your country and oppose all foreign intervention 
it is evident that all this is orchestrated to keep samuel doe 
in power taylor said in the broadcast from a station in the 
northern town of yekepa we are confronted with the challenge of 
a new colonization as in the times of slavery 
taylor has a much larger army than johnsons but thousands are 
young recruits with little training and they have been bogged down 
by government troops six miles east of does mansion johnsons men 
had reached to within hundreds of yards of the presidential 
residence when they withdraw to confront taylors troops 
approaching from their rear 
leaders of seven west african states are scheduled to meet in 
banjul gambia on monday to discuss the conflict and nigerian 
proposals to send in a task force to end the war 
about 5000 people mostly civilians have been killed in the 
fighting on july 30 about 600 civilians in a lutheran church 
compound were massacred witnesses blamed government troops but 
the government said they were rebels dressed as government troops 
the rebels accuse doe who took power in a 1980 coup of 
corruption

democrats get out your checkbooks and dig out 
those 1988 buttons the duke thinks he might want to give it 
another try 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis he of the plummeting poll 
ratings and slumping state budget hasnt ruled anything out for 
92 
in a television interview broadcast sunday the 1988 democratic 
nominee sounded like a man ready to get up off the canvas and go 
another round 
can you ever see yourself running for president again the 
governor was asked on cspan a cable tv public affairs network 
maybe maybe dukakis said 
i dont think you rule it out i dont think you rule it in 
he said kitty and i are still relatively young weve still got 
our health weve got a lot of energy its an exciting and 
wondrous world out there these days as we read about the 
cataclysmic changes every day internationally and otherwise 
the comments were only a slight advance from what dukakis has 
been saying all along since his crushing defeat at the hands of 
george bush two years ago never say never has been the 
consistent dukakis line 
i want to keep my hand in public life he said in response 
to the latest queries what form that takes i dont know 
marty linsky a political analyst at harvards john f kennedy 
school of government and a longtime acquaintance of dukakis found 
a dry way of depicting the governors chances 
there certainly doesnt seem to be much external data for 
it linsky said he cited a recent presidential preference poll 
of democratic national committee members in which not a single 
member mentioned dukakis 
dukakis is retiring from the governors office in january after 
three terms polling data editorials and political commentary seem 
to hold that up as a wise decision 
since losing to bush dukakis has come home to a state beset by 
budget shortfalls the specter of tax increases and an electorate 
angry with his administration 
for now dukakis said i want to finish up my final year as 
governor as strong as i possibly can leave a good solid state for 
my successor and then kitty and i will kind of take a look at the 
world and decide where we go from here

democrat john silbers shootfromthehip style 
has transformed him from a candidate who barely qualified for the 
massachusetts primary election ballot into a central character in 
its governors race 
the outspoken boston university president dominated headlines 
again last week this time by taking aim at the headline writers 
silber stormed into the cafeteria of the boston globe to 
announce he would stop participating in candidate forums sponsored 
by the globe and by the boston herald 
the reason he said was that the newspapers were distorting his

theres one thing to be said for live television said 
silber who is on leave from his post at bu where he was president 
for 20 years there is no editing and there is no way of putting 
a persons thumb on the scales 
and with that the 63yearold philosopher and administrator who 
refuses to talk political plastic once again made himself the 
issue 
according to silber he is running against a former state 
attorney general and the lieutenant governor in the democratic 
primary as well as a press that focuses mainly on sensational 
comments instead of his overall views 
he has made blunt remarks about everything from welfare to 
feminists giving him a public profile distinctly different from 
the democrat he hopes to replace retiring threeterm gov michael 
s dukakis 
the remark that created the biggest furor came during an early 
globe forum on health care in commenting on how best to distribute 
health care funds he referred to extraordinary and costly health 
care measures to prolong the life of the elderly he then let loose 
with what has come to be known as a silber shocker 
when youve had a long life and youre ripe then its time 
to go he said 
silber cried foul when one of his democratic opponents former 
attorney general francis x bellotti used the quote in a campaign 
ad 
back in january in the midst of putting forth the view that 
massachusetts welfare policies were attracting people from 
outofstate silber said why should lowell be the cambodian 
capital of america it is extraordinary why should they all be 
concentrated in one place 
and more recently at a forum on womens issues he said in 
response to questions about judicial appointments i would not 
put a white supremacist on the court for fear a black could not get 
a fair trial in his court neither would i put somebody like louis 
farrakhan on the bench who i think might discriminate against 
whites likewise i would not appoint gloria steinem to the bench 
that brought him criticism for lumping steinem with farrakhan 
and white supremacists 
as the newspaper forums progressed silber became the issue 
even when he missed one and left the field open for bellotti and 
lt gov evelyn murphy the third democrat seeking the governors 
seat 
after silber dropped out of the forum his opponents immediately 
said the academic administrator making his first run for public 
office couldnt take the roughandtumble of political debate 
if you cant stand the political heat john then maybe you 
should get out of the campaign kitchen murphy said 
public opinion polls have shown silber and bellotti in a dead 
heat with murphy slightly behind in the running for the sept 18 
primary 
in the republican race house minority leader steven pierce has 
held a comfortable lead over his lone opponent former us 
attorney william weld but polls also showed pierce well behind 
silber and bellotti 
former us sen paul tsongas welcomed silbers entry into the 
race anticipating silbers presence would elevate the level of 
debate but he said silber must share the blame when the substance 
of his remarks is lost 
the media has run with things and has blown certain statements 
out of proportion but twas ever so tsongas said that will 
always be the case if you speak in terms that lend themselves to 
that sort of thing

japan on sunday imposed tough sanctions against 
iraq for its invasion of kuwait including a ban on oil imports and 
japanese exports to the two countries 
the unprecedented japanese move which significantly broadened a 
ussupported campaign to isolate iraq for its invasion followed 
an announcement by china that it would not sell arms to iraq 
italy and spain two european community countries most 
dependent on foreign crude oil also announced sunday they would 
follow ec guidelines and impose sanctions 
in kuwait the iraqiinstalled provisional government in a 
statement carried by the iraqi news agency told other countries to 
refrain from taking punishing measures against it or iraq the 
provisional government said countries have to remember they have 
interests and citizens in kuwait and said it was prepared to 
close embassies and cut diplomatic relations with offending nations 
the united states already has banned oil imports from kuwait and 
iraq and frozen both countries assets in the united states 
japan said it will suspend loans and ban japanese investment and 
financing in both iraq and kuwait and freeze iraqi assets in 
japan chief government spokesman misoji sakamoto said 
iraq became eligible in february for 267 billion in japanese 
government credits which it had not yet received 
international conflicts must be settled peacefully from this 
standpoint we strongly denounce the iraqi military invasion of 
kuwait sakamoto said the government will fully support 
international efforts to settle the dispute through negotiations 
in washington the white house hailed japans decision it said 
prime minister toshiki kaifu called president bush on sunday to 
inform him of the sanctions 
these unprecedented measures undertaken by japan are in step 
with those that the united states and other countries have put in 
place against iraq for its blatant aggression against kuwait 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the president welcomed prime minister kaifus and the japanese 
cabinets decision and expressed confidence that such measures will 
help intensify international pressures aimed at achieving the 
immediate complete and unconditional withdrawal of iraq from 
kuwait fitzwater said 
on saturday bush telephoned kaifu to ask for japans support in 
sanctions against iraq and all 100 members of the us senate 
signed a letter urging tokyo to join other nations that have 
imposed sanctions 
the sanctions which exceeded those imposed saturday by the 
european community are the toughest that postwar japan has ever 
imposed the japan broadcasting corp reported 
news reports said the decision had been delayed because of 
differences of views within the government the foreign ministry 
reportedly urged the government to join its western allies in 
imposing sanctions while the trade ministry warned of resulting 
damage to japans economy 
japanese newspapers said some trade ministry officials had 
expressed concern that sanctions on iraq would push up oil prices 
in japan and worsen chances for baghdads repayment of 46 billion 
in outstanding debts with japan much of that is held by the 
private sector 
japan depends on foreign sources for 99 percent of its oil 
needs and imported an average of 260000 barrels a day or 62 
percent of its total consumption from iraq in the first quarter of 
this year it obtained 5 percent of its oil from kuwait or 210000 
barrels a day according to the trade ministry 
on friday the japanese government instructed banks and other 
financial institutions to block iraqi access to the estimated 20 
billion in kuwaiti assets held in japan 
following that decision officials initially said they would 
wait to decide on further measures until the un security council 
takes action on a resolution calling for sanctions the council may 
discuss the resolution on monday 
in beijing the official xinhua news agency quoted an 
unidentified foreign ministry spokesman as saying china supported 
the un security council resolution condemning iraqs invasion of 
kuwait and would therefore not sell arms to iraq 
spains foreign ministry issued a communique sunday saying spain 
would require government approval for any foreign transfer of 
kuwaiti assets in spain and would soon freeze iraqi assets 
the communique said the measures were in line with the ec 
sanctions which included an oil embargo on iraq and iraqioccupied 
kuwait a halt on arms sales to iraq and the suspension of 
cooperation with iraq in the military technical and scientific 
fields 
nearly 11 percent of the ecs oil imports last year were from 
iraq and kuwait 
in italy justice minister giuliano vassalli said italy agreed 
to freeze iraqi assetsthe government on friday froze kuwaiti 
assets held in italy and suspended arms shipments to iraq 
the soviet union iraqs main arms supplier announced thursday 
it was ending arms sales to iraq

a former ku klux klan grand dragon an 
impeached black federal judge and a selfdescribed salty old 
newspaperman are battling in a primary campaign for a state 
cabinet post that they insist wont focus solely on race 
but the exjudge alcee hastings of miami said the lastminute 
entry of john paul rogers former united klans of america leader 
into the democratic primary for florida secretary of state has 
forced him to switch to a campaign based on civil rights because of 
the emotions a klansman can stir 
im not going to let him get a free ride hastings said i 
didnt want to run a civil rights campaign the color of my skin 
shouldnt have anything to do with the issues im presenting 
hastings said he takes rogers seriously but can see some humor 
in the contrast between an avowed racist and a black liberal former 
judge 
if rogers doesnt burn any crosses in my community i wont 
spit any watermelon seeds in his hastings said 
rogers who entered the race just before the deadline july 20 
hastings and former tallahassee democrat editorial writer jim 
minter are seeking the democratic nod in the sept 4 primary to 
oppose republican incumbent jim smith for secretary of state the 
post is one of six florida cabinet positions elected statewide 
the main duties of the job are to run the states elections 
keep corporate records and file financial disclosure forms turned 
in by elected and appointed officials but theres more to it than 
just that as one of the cabinet posts the office also shares 
power with the governor on a wide range of statewide issues from 
environmental conservation to education 
smith who only recently switched to the gop got more than 26 
million votes in the 1986 election and will be a favorite against 
any of the three democrats 
rogers a lake wales barber and real estate agent said he left 
the klan 2 years ago 
rogers who has unsuccessfully run for the state house and for a 
couple of local offices refused to renounce the klans supremacist 
philosophy but said race and hastings didnt figure in his decision 
to run 
i hope people wont vote for or against me based on race 
rogers said i havent injected it at all and i dont plan to i 
hope people will vote on the issues 
florida democratic party chairman simon ferro has flatly 
declared the party would never support the exklansman if hes the 
nominee 
yet ferro says he would have no problem backing hastings who 
was aquitted of bribery charges in federal court but impeached in 
1989 by the senate over claims of an alleged payment to reduce 
sentences for racketeers hastings has always maintained his 
innocence 
he was impeached but that doesnt take away his rights to 
elective office and his right to have the voters judge his 
abilities and record ferro said it does not go to the core 
problem of a person belonging to a hate organization 
rogers has tried to turn the tables on ferro by claiming 
discrimination 
i consider this to be highly prejudicial and insensitive 
bigotry rogers said 
hastings has concentrated his campaign in south florida where 
he appeals to solid voting blocs of minorities who agree with his 
claim that the government railroaded him 
people are empathetic sympathetic when they hear the facts of 
the case they are outraged he said 
minter hopes to benefit from the clash between his two opponents 
minter began covering politics for the miami herald in 1968 he 
has spent time in state government including a stint working for 
former secretary of state george firestone and some time as a 
speechwriter for former gov reubin askew he resigned from the 
editorial board of the talahassee democrat to join this years 
campaign 
im the tallahassee pro here minter said i have been an 
insider in state government and ive covered it as a 
newspaperman

a dearth of federal dollars and good program 
management means rural and smalltown americans continue to suffer 
needlessly from poverty and pollution a yearlong study concludes 
the report by the center for community change criticized the 
farmers home administration for being run by people lacking 
backgrounds in finance civil engineering and organizing and 
blamed the reagan administration for serious funding cutbacks 
the fmha an agriculture department agency that has its roots in 
the great depression of the 1930s handles a variety of farm 
housing and community programs 
federal support for rural development was cut by nearly 70 
percent during the reagan administration said robert rapoza who 
directed the study yet the majority of the remaining funds 
failed to reach the neediest rural communities the federal 
response to these communities has been plainly inadequate 
the report searching for the way that works said rural 
problems include 
unemployment adjusted to include underemployment is onethird 
higher than in the cities 
rural americans are more likely to be poor onethird more 
rural people than urban residents are below the poverty line 
ninetyseven percent of the nations rural residents rely on 
ground water for drinking yet a 1984 survey by the environmental 
protection administration found twothirds of the wells were 
contaminated 
almost two million rural residents live in substandard housing 
usually lacking adequate plumbing 
maternal and infant mortality rates are substantially higher 
than in urban areas and are rising at faster rates 
rural residents are as a group less educated less healthy 
and less skilled than their urban counterparts the report 
saidthey operate in a comparatively static more conservative 
business environment and they receive less help from washington 
the center a nonprofit advocacy group for lowincome rural 
people conducted the study with a grant from the ford foundation 
joe oneill a spokesman for the fmha said the agency had not 
had the opportunity to study the report but he said were 
always pleased to get these kinds of studies and they can be 
very useful 
the report criticized the fmha for not targeting more of its 
resources to poor communities to help build water and sewer 
systems health centers fire houses and businesses these programs 
add up to about 900 million this year 
according to the report povertylevel communities got only 2 
percent to 3 percent of total fmha loans and grants for water and 
sewer facilities between 1985 and 1988 
the report said one reason for not targeting on the poorest 
communities is the way fmha uses poverty data 
while the agency adjusts the poverty line upward each year it 
uses 1980 census numbers to determine the average income of 
individual communities it said thus some communities whose 
average income exceeded the poverty level in 1980 now fall under 
todays higher poverty line 
the effect according to the report is that those communities 
qualify for fmha assistance even though others are much poorer 
programs operated by the environmental protection agency also 
were criticized for failing to provide more help for rural areas to 
meet federal water standards 
epa figures indicate that twothirds of rural water supplies 
violate agency drinking water standards said maureen kennedy 
principal author of the report given this need it is disturbing 
that the epa has naot provided more support to rural areas 
the report hedged on recommending a vast reorganization of 
federal rural development programs such as blending them all into 
one super agency but it did propose some administrative changes 
within usdas hierarchy 
also it said many communities lack the knowhow for getting 
access to federal programs that might help them develop 
futher the report said most fmha staff people come from 
agricultural backgrounds despite the fact that these programs 
demand training in finance civil engineering and organizing 
consequently fmha should strengthen its substantive training 
programs but more importantly the agency should focus its 
recruiting efforts on those with backgrounds appropriate to the 
changing needs of the agency the report said

food critics often liken bernard glassmans 
gourmet cakes and tortes to paradise 
but this brooklynborn zen buddhist abbot is concerned with 
earthly missions like providing job skills and housing for the 
disadvantaged and trying to save south american rain forests 
browsers at bloomingdales weekenders in long islands 
fashionable hamptons and diners at sardis regularly savor 
glassmans greyston bakery goodies which are sold in 300 gourmet 
shops and restaurants nationwide 
greyston also provides the vermontbased ben amp jerrys ice cream 
company with the brownies that go into its chocolate fudge brownie 
ice cream 
and soon the two socially conscious companies will market a new 
chocolatechip cookie which they hope will not only taste good but 
help save trees in the brazilian rain forest and provide work for 
the homeless in this new york suburb 
greyston and its sibling companies have taught job skills to 
some 200 homeless and those at risk of losing their homes since 
1982 
come fall the company plans to use its profits and federal and 
state aid to renovate buildings near the bakery which will be 
owned and managed by the formerly homeless tenants 
glassman describes the entrepreneurial effort as a mandala or 
circle of activities fostering jobs social action and interfaith 
expression 
the term mandala symbolizes a wholeness for which one strives in 
buddhism a religion and philosophic system which teaches that 
right thinking and selfdenial will enable the soul to reach 
nirvana a divine state of release from misdirected desire 
the zen sect seeks to attain an intuitive illumination of mind 
and spirit through meditation 
all of the profits from the bakery and two other zenoperated 
businesses one that trains minority construction workers and 
another that trains poorly paid office workers for jobs in the 
bakery and construction company goes into the greyston family 
inn a zenrun social services agency 
glassman who became a zen monk in 1970 and quit his aerospace 
engineer job a few years later oversees agency operations from the 
bakery a former lasagne factory in a rundown section of downtown 
yonkers 
glassman who has slipped on a white smock that identifies him 
as the sensei or teacher says he started the bakery with 
40000 from the yonkers private industry council 
when it started in 1983 the bakery had sales of 282000 this 
year glassman expects to bring in 18 million 
glassman said initial sales were made on the strength of the 
product not on the activist philosophy but thats changing 
only in the last few years has the fact that were involved in 
social action even been noticed he said 
three years ago glassman met ben cohen cofounder of ben amp 
jerrys at a gathering of activist entrepreneurs the two hit it 
off and the brownie deal was quickly sealed 
soon greyston will begin making chocolate chip cookies with nut 
flour a leftover from a ben amp jerrys offshoot that uses brazil 
nuts grown in the amazon rain forest for rainforest crunch 
candy and ice cream the businessmen believe that promoting nuts as 
a cash crop will encourage brazilians to maintain the rain forest 
eat a cookie save a tree proclaims glassman

a marine who pleaded guilty to using lsd 
on a hawaii military base is serving five years in the brig even 
though a urine test showed no trace of drugs in his body 
the parents of pfc charles serauskas 21 of stone lake in 
northwestern wisconsin have already spent 20000 to bring an 
appeal they say their son was still drunk and suffering from 
depression when he confessed to using and distributing lsd or what 
he thought was lsd at a barracks party last oct 13 
court records indicate that no drugs were found on serauskas 
and a urinalysis taken just hours his arrest on the night of the 
party turned up no sign of the drug the sample has since been 
destroyed 
we are going to fight them said serauskas father leonard 
i cant believe in this country you can be convicted when there 
is no evidence against you 
their son confessed hes guilty countered capt leonard 
ryan a spokesman for the marine corps air station at kaneohe bay 
hawaii where serauskas was arrested in that case there doesnt 
have to be evidence 
military records show that five other marines who testified they 
received lsd from serauskas were tested for drugs just hours after 
the party and no evidence of drugs was found in their urine 
either 
serauskas made a second confession at a sentencing hearing but 
his family claims he was given bad advice by his military lawyer 
who advised him to plead guilty in hopes of getting a lenient 
sentence of no more than two years 
instead serauskas was sentenced to seven years later reduced 
to five years in the pearl harbor guardhouse 
an appeal is pending before the military court of review in 
washington if it fails the case will be taken through civilian 
courts the family said 
serauskas drank at least a case of beer and some whiskey at the 
party 
with a confession of intent to use drugs physical evidence was 
unnecessary the military argued 
chief warrant office randy gaddo a spokesman for marine corps 
headquarters in washington said a persons intent to commit a 
crime is considered to be evidence in both military and civilian 
courts but the intent would weigh in with other evidence and 
other circumstances 
the serauskas family allege that the militarys witnesses were 
intimidated 
this case isnt a legal technicality this case is a lack of 
evidence said robert finlay a hawaii lawyer hired by the family 
he is the farthest thing from a dope dealer that ever was 
finlay said maybe he is guilty as hell but they sure couldnt 
prove it 
finlay said he has found evidence that the five other marines 
were threatened by military officers to testify against serauskas 
or risk being sent to the brig on various charges 
military prosecutors acknowledged that the five were questioned 
before a panel of seven officers court records indicate they were 
urged to tell the truth and prison punishment was discussed 
the five were later given honorable discharges 
the military judge who reviewed and then denied serauskas 
motion for retrial made no reference to the threats or the 
discharged soldiers he ruled serauskas was competent and 
understood the implications of his guilty plea 
in transcripts from his courtmartial serauskas an artillery 
cannoneer told the judge he purchased what he believed were 14 
doses or hits of lsd from a fellow marine 
he told the judge he ate three hits it made me kind of 
paranoid sir and i felt high sir see colors the walls move 
he said 
according to court records serauskas had received several 
marine citations during his threeyear career but he also had been 
cited for unexcused absences from a therapy program drunken 
driving and making false statements before his arrest his rank 
had been reduced from lance corporal to private first class in a 
disciplinary action

diplomatic sources said sunday that iraq 
may have executed 15 proiranian terrorists whose freedom was 
demanded by factions holding western hostages in lebanon 
but there were conflicting reports of the fate of the 
terrorists who had been held in a kuwaiti prison until iraqs 
invasion of the emirate thursday 
other diplomats said the kuwaiti prisoners had been taken to 
baghdad and a third report said the shiite moslem prisoners 
escaped during the invasion 
the proiranian islamic jihad or islamic holy war has 
repeatedly demanded that comrades jailed in kuwait for bombing the 
us and french embassies be released before it will free western 
hostages 
seventeen men mostly iranian and iraqi shiite moslems were 
jailed in kuwait in february 1984 for the dec 12 1983 car 
bombings that killed five people and wounded 86 
two were released in february 1989 after serving fiveyear 
sentences the kuwaitis have repeatedly refused to free any of the 
others including three whod been condemned to death but whose 
sentences have not been carried out 
the kuwaitis have identified the bombers as members of the 
proiranian addawa arabic for islamic call an iraqi group that 
seeks to topple saddams government in baghdad 
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf speaking on condition of 
anonymity said sunday they believed the 15 had been executed 
because of their membership in addawa the report could not be 
confirmed by official sources 
however kuwaiti embassy officials in amman jordan citing 
reports from reliable official and political sources in 
kuwait said the prisoners were seized by iraqis and taken to 
baghdad apparently to be used by president saddam hussein and used 
as a bargaining chip 
a senior kuwaiti embassy official speaking to the associated 
press on condition of anonymity said official reports to the 
embassy said that iraq seized the prisoners on saturday 
iraqi embassy officials said they had no information on that 
report 
radio monte carlo said arab press sources had quoted a foreign 
resident of kuwait as saying that the 15 were among 1300 prisoners 
who escaped during the turmoil of the invasion fortyfive 
political prisoners were reportedly among the escapees 
that report also could not be confirmed by oficial sources 
on friday the abc television network reported that the 
prisoners were freed after the invasion but gave no further 
details 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god believed to be 
the umbrella group for factions holding 16 westerners hostage in 
lebanon withheld comment on that report the longest held hostage 
is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985

a top iraqi official warned turkey on 
sunday not to cut two pipelines in turkey that carry more than half 
of iraqs total oil exports 
president bush had suggested friday that turkey could close the 
pipelines to protest iraqs invasion of kuwait 
iraqi deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan told reporters 
that a a turkish decision to shut down the pipeline would 
create mistrust between the two countries 
in the case of an economic embargo or a military intervention 
those who take these actions would be the losing party he added 
ramadan met with president turgut ozal during his fourhour 
visit to the capital of ankara 
a spokesman for ozal kaya toperi said ramadan delivered a 
message from iraqi president saddam hussein explaining why iraq 
invaded there was no further information on the message 
the turkish presidential office said ozal in his meeting with 
ramadan called on iraq to adopt a realistic and constructive 
attitude urgently 
president bush said friday it was certainly an option for 
turkey to cut the iraqi pipelines bush spoke by telephone to ozal 
on friday and saturday 
on saturday ozal told reporters there have been no demands 
from the united states for the closure of the pipeline such a 
demand is out of question 
it is wrong to relate the issue iraqi invasion with the 
closure of the pipeline ozal said i explained to bush that 
it was not that simple 
ramadan said he believed turkey would continue to say neutral in 
the persian gulf turkey which borders both iran and iraq 
remained neutral throughout the eightyear persian gulf war 
iraq exports 27 million barrels of oil daily and 16 million 
barrels of that oil flows through turkey 
turkey obtains 60 percent of its crude oil imports from iraq 
turkey earns 250 million from iraq annually for operating the 
pipeline

saudi arabia has deployed 200 to 300 tanks 
toward its border with kuwait where iraqi armored forces were 
reported to have moved into position said an american technician 
who returned sunday from saudi arabia 
in addition he said the families of american civilian 
employees at a saudi military base in the northern desert had been 
moved to riyadh the saudi capital and all others are on notice 
to evacuate 
the american who left saudi arabia on saturday spoke with the 
associated press after arriving at kennedy international airport 
on condition that he not be identified 
he said he saw the tanks moving out of king khalid military 
city a large saudi military complex in the desert about 80 miles 
southwest of the point where the borders of iraq kuwait and saudi 
arabia come together 
a former us commander in the persian gulf said the deployed 
tanks probably were drawn from a rapid deployment force 
maintained at the saudi base known as kkmc by the six member 
countries of the gulf cooperation council 
george b crist a retired marine corps general who formerly 
headed us central command the overall headquarters for american 
forces in the region said it was a safe bet that the council 
force was ordered into the field thats just what it was up 
there for he said in a telephone interview 
the unit includes two brigades each with about 5000 men and 
100 or more usbuilt m1 and m48 tanks one brigade is allsaudi 
and the other consists of single battalions from kuwait bahrain 
qatar the united arab emirates and the sultanate of oman under 
saudi command 
the gulf cooperation council set up the rapid deployment force 
several years ago as part of a mutual assistance agreement but 
this apparently would be its first use in a battlefield situation 
the american technician who works at the base said the 
deployment apparently occurred friday a day after the iraqis 
invaded kuwait and deposed its government forcing the emir sheik 
jaber alahmed alsabah to flee to saudi arabia 
the iraqis on friday advanced some troops and tanks to within a 
few miles of the saudi border according to us officials in 
washington 
the american said there had been no reports on how far apart the 
two forces were 
the saudi military complex which does not appear on maps lies 
off a main northsouth road it is about 35 miles in circumference

just when it seemed it could travel no 
faster the blinding pace of german unification appears ready to 
put on another burst of speed blink and you may miss history 
west german chancellor helmut kohl punched the fastforward 
button once again last week when he said that the two german 
nations should elect a single government on oct 14 
thats seven weeks sooner than the already quick dec 2 election 
date that kohl proposed earlier this year 
then as now the opposition social democrats in both countries 
have opposed the move saying it would require too much tinkering 
with west germanys election laws 
but horst ehmke deputy chairman of the west german social 
democrats reportedly left open the possibility the east german 
social democrats may propose an instant unity during a special 
parliamentary session this week 
asked by the newspaper bild whether the east german social 
democrats might make such a move during the wednesday session in 
east berlin ehmke reportedly replied i dont know i dont 
exclude it 
both kohls conservative christian democrats and the 
leftleaning social democrats are using the timing and sequence of 
german unity to enhance their own political fortunes 
but behind the bluster is one issue that is pushing the process 
ever faster whether east germany has the economic strength or the 
political will to continue as a sovereign nation for very much 
longer 
the young democratic government has become increasingly 
distressed over its empty coffers and the plight of its industries 
trying desperately to tread water in the nations onemonthold 
free market 
west germany which already has commited 71 billion to 
unification has turned down east german pleas for additional help 
there is a growing feeling in east germany that the country 
should dissolve itself and unify soon so its financial situation 
becomes the total responsibility of the bonn government 
even if elections for a single government are held on oct 14 
actual unification could take place much sooner 
it is up to east germany to enact unification that will be done 
when its parliament approves a clause in the west german 
constitution that will allow it to accede to its bigger neighbor 
right now east german joblessness while climbing is being 
kept artificially low by a west germanfinanced program to keep 
workers on payrolls at shortened hours and lower wages 
without that program unemployment would likely be at more than 
10 percent rather than the 27 percent it was officially estimated 
at last month 
joblessness is expected to eventually top out next year at 
perhaps 30 percent or 40 percent 
kohls christian democrats want allgerman elections to take 
place quickly to avoid a potential loss of voter support when the 
east german economy collapses 
for that reason the social democrats are fighting to keep the 
elections from being moved up to oct 14 
but the social democrats also say now that they would accept 
actual unification much sooner because of east germanys economic 
problems 
that would allow them to be perceived as embracing a process 
they have tried to slow while still benefiting politically from 
elections in december when the economic woes are expected to be 
much worse 
there is another wild card that could though unlikely throw 
the whole process out of whack 
oct 14 is the date already set for east germany to elect and 
create five state governments so the country can fit into the 
federal system in west germany which now has 11 states 
once those five state governments are created political 
analysts say they can technically vote individually whether to 
unify with west germany 
that means a state if it wants could decide that its 
particular industrial or agricultural economy needs to be attached 
to wealthy west germany right now not in december 
that may be another reason why kohl wants national elections on 
the day east german state elections are held less than three weeks 
before the first anniversary of the opening of the berlin wall

presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said there was no 
indication that iraq had sent its battlehardened forces into saudi 
arabia a critical world oil supplier although sen david boren 
said there had been minor incursions he described as sort of 
putting a foot across 
tens of thousands of iraqi troops were reported massed in kuwait 
near the saudi border rep les aspin dwis said fresh 
intelligence reports indicated an additional 18 iraqi divisions 
moving south toward saudi arabia but bush said he had not heard 
such reports 
after stepping out of his marine one helicopter bush read a 
note handed to him by richard n haass a national security council 
senior director for near eastern affairs before facing reporters 
bush juggling developments in two crisisridden regions of the 
world also issued orders for us marines to evacuate americans 
from wartorn liberia and protect the us embassy there 
he said he did not think any americans were in imminent 
danger in kuwait 
in a thinlyveiled signal to saddam fitzwater said the liberia 
operation demonstrates that bush is extremely concerned about the 
welfare of american citizens we have acted time and again in 
behalf of their safety im sure that iraq and other countries 
are aware of that 
bush spoke earlier sunday with japanese prime minister toshiki 
kaifu and praised japans decision to ban oil imports from iraq and 
kuwait which have supplied more than 11 percent of japans oil 
i appplaud japans stance cracking down on the imports from 
iraq said bush 
the white house dismissed claims that saddam was pulling his 
troops out of kuwait three days after an invasion that replaced the 
250yearold monarchy with a new government supposedly composed of 
nine kuwaiti army officers 
we have no independent or confirmable information on this 
report fitzwater said saddam husseins actions in the past 
raise serious skepticism about his intentions 
boren dokla said on abctv that intelligence reports did not 
indicate any troop rollback particularly along the southern border 
with saudi arabia so if they are taking anybody out its 
probably just a few people for show he said 
a us official who declined to be identified said it appeared 
iraqi troops were digging in rather than pulling out building 
fortifications in some parts of the conquered country 
as tensions rose in the region the washington post reported 
sunday that special operations forces and hostage rescue forces 
have been dispatched to the mideast and that contingency plans call 
for sending stealth fighters and b52 bombers 
i cant comment on any specific military actions or 
movements fitzwater said 
however he said the united states has extreme concern about 
the welfare of our citizens 
asked if the united states had asked saudi arabia for access to 
military facilities or landing rights to stage a military 
operation fitzwater said we do not have any us military 
staged in saudi arabia and we are discussing all options with 
them the saudis have been reluctant in the past to allow any 
us military exercises on their soil not wishing to provoke their 
neighbors 
a senior administration official said there have been numerous 
crossborder sorties by the iraqis into saudi arabian territory 
but that they have been very small and very brief incursions 
fitzwater confirmed that 11 american oil workers rounded up in 
kuwait after the invasion had been brought to baghdad he said they 
had talked with us embassy officials and appeared to be in good 
shape 
this accounts for all missing americans fitzwater said

for the entire country the russian federation is by far the 
largest of the soviet unions 15 republics and is home to more than 
half of the nations population 
while gorbachev vacationed in the crimea yeltsin took his 
holiday on the baltic sea in latvia he did not spend much time on

economy excluding land and natural resources within four or five 
years property will be sold to private individuals or collectives

president zhelyu zhelev said sunday that 
he will call immediate meetings with the countrys political 
parties to try to find solutions for bulgarias social turmoil 
in another development antigovernment protesters in the 
selfproclaimed city of truth who helped bring about the 
resignation last month of zhelevs socialist predecessor began 
dismantling their tent city in downtown sofia 
it was not immediately clear how many of the estimated 300 
people living there fulltime would leave the prodemocracy 
encampment only a few of the tents which at one point numbered 
about 170 were expected to remain 
zhelev said he would immediately call meetings with parties 
represented in parliament to find a way out of the crisis 
according to the state bta news agency 
in his televised speech bulgarias first noncommunist 
president in 40 years also urged the parties to form a council to 
consult with him 
he called on fellow opposition members to help him find an 
answer to bulgarias economic political and moral crisis 
zhelev a philosopher who led the opposition union of democratic 
forces in junes free elections was elected wednesday by 
parliament 
zhelevs election ended the parliamentary stalemate between 
socialists and the opposition over a replacement for petar mladenov 
mladenov a socialist resigned july 6 after he was accused of 
calling for tanks against antigovernment demonstrations last year 
and amid threats of escalating strikes 
the demonstrations started bulgaria on a path of democratic 
reform in november communist party members ousted longtime leader 
todor zhivkov they later changed the partys name to the socialist 
party 
zhelev says he favors the formation of a government of experts 
supported by both the socialists and the union of democratic 
forces his statement indicated that some opposition members could 
join the government while avoiding a formal coalition 
the opposition repeatedly has rejected offers of a coalition 
from incumbent socialist premier andrei lukanov arguing that the 
former communist party must shoulder responsibility for past 
political crimes and the rapidly deteriorating economy 
zhelev also said sunday that he would rescind all laws which 
violate the constitution in the first place those which infringe 
upon the fundamental rights of the citizens 
he said he will soon lift restrictions on bulgarians to move 
freely around the country including the right to live in the 
capital 
earlier sunday the protesters made clear that they decided to 
remove their tents because their main demands have already been met 
by the government that included a request that zhivkov be allowed 
to speak before parliament about his 35 years in power 
antigovernment campers in other towns where tents have been 
pitched to campaign for greater democracy and other causes said 
they would continue their protest 
the protesters who have put up 13 tent cities in towns across 
bulgaria have claimed 250000 supporters

british prime minister margaret thatcher on 
sunday called for a new magna carta that would establish basic 
rights for all europeans including the soviets 
mrs thatcher also renewed her call for the united nations to 
apply a total economic embargo against iraq unless it withdraws 
without delay from its occupation of kuwait she said the embargo 
only would be fully effective if it were supported by all members 
of the united nations 
iraqs invastion of kuwait defies every principle for which 
the un stands if we let it succeed no small country can ever feel 
safe again the law of the jungle takes over she said 
the prime minister devoted most of her remarks to more than 
3000 people at the aspen institute to her vision of the new europe 
the european community has reconciled antagonisms within 
western europe it should now help to overcome divisions between 
east and west in europe she sand at the closing session of the 
institutes 40th anniversary 
we dont see this new soviet union as an enemy but as a 
country groping its way towards freedom we no longer have to view 
the world through the prism of eastwest relations the cold war is 
over 
at the end of her halfhour speech inside the big blueandwhite 
aspen music festival tent the crowd gave thatcher a standing 
ovation 
about 1700 people were seated inside the big top the rest were 
scattered about the lawn outside in the warm summer air 
thatcher traveled to the institute to address its annual 
symposium and receive its statesman award which recognized the 
prime ministers long reign and her commitment to democracy and 
peace 
thatcher met with president bush in aspen on thursday before his 
opening address at the institute she is scheduled to travel to 
washington dc monday for an afternoon meeting with bush then 
return to london early tuesday 
during her speech thatcher said western nations need to help 
nations struggling to establish democracy but at the same time 
maintain a secure defense including nato and us forces in europe 
the unity and strength which we in the west have found from 
joining together in defense can now be turned to serve more 
positive and ambitious purposes she said 
king john of england was forced by english barons to grant the 
original magna carta at runnymede england june 15 1215 it 
traditionally has been interpreted as guaranteeing certain civil 
and political liberties 
the prime minister said her proposed european magna carta would 
entrench for every european citizen including those of the 
soviet union the basic rights we in the west take for granted 
among those rights freedom of speech worship access to law 
and the marketplace and the freedom to hold democratic elections 
own property maintain nationhood and remain free of fear of an 
overmighty state 
she also suggested that the european community be poised to 
accept all eastern european nations as members when democracy has 
taken root and their economies are capable of sustaining 
membership 
we cant say in one breath that they are part of europe and 
in the next our european community club is so exclusive that we 
wont admit them she said 
founded in 1950 the nonprofit aspen institute gathers leaders 
in all parts of society to discuss critical issues of the world 
the symposium this weekend concentrated on topics including health 
care and education

iraq said it had started withdrawing part of its 
invasion force from kuwait on sunday and the kuwaiti government 
installed by baghdad threatened to retaliate against any nation 
that challenges its legitimacy 
in washington president bush said iraq had lied once again 
in claiming that it was withdrawing its invasion force the 
president said he wanted to see arab countries join in condemning 
the iraqi invasion 
dozens of tanks armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying 
hundreds of soldiers were seen crossing the border back into iraq 
at the safwan checkpoint about 30 miles south of the iraqi port 
city of basra 
however thousands of iraqi soldiers remained behind tightening 
their grip on the oilrich desert country 
at his impromptu news conference bush said the united states 
would not recognize the kuwaiti puppet government set up by 
iraq he refused to discuss any military action the united states 
might be planning and he said his goal was to isolate iraq 
internationally 
us officials said there was no indication iraqi troops in 
southern kuwait were preparing to invade saudi arabia but bush 
dispatched defense secretary dick cheney to saudi arabia to confer 
with leaders of the desert kingdom administration sources said 
sunday 
diplomats in the persian gulf who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that up to 80000 soldiers of the new largely 
iraqistaffed popular army of the provisional kuwaiti 
government were fanning out across kuwait 
the television of the iraqiinstalled government in kuwait 
monitored in bahrain showed 30 minutes of continuous footage with 
military vehicles rolling back into iraq starting at 8 am 
twelve arab reporters based in baghdad were taken into kuwait on 
sunday by iraqs ministry of information to observe the first iraqi 
troops returning home 
a senior iraqi officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the first phase of pulling out the iraqi troops from the 
dusty desert state began and we will continue as long as the 
security of the troops and situation in kuwait allows 
he refused to give details on how many iraqi troops remained in 
kuwait saying there are enough to defend the sisterly arab 
countries against any foreign aggression 
about 100000 iraqi troops were estimated to have taken part in 
the initial invasion 
the reporters could not locate any of the nine members of the 
new kuwaiti provisional military government nor anyone who spoke 
for them 
roads connecting the iraqi border with kuwait city about 60 
miles away were littered with cars hastily abandoned during the 
first hours of the invasion many had been smashed by tanks to 
clear a path 
in kuwait city at least 30 burned and destroyed vehicles 
remained outside the defense ministry where eyewitnesses said a 
battle raged for hours after thursdays invasion 
hospital officials said many soldiers from both sides were 
killed during the first day of the invasion they were unable to 
give exact figures but said at least 300 died 
residents said the city was quiet during the daytime but 
gunfire could be heard at night most residents remained behind 
closed doors but some people ventured into the streets to search 
for food and stared at the iraqi troops 
in other developments sunday 
japan banned all oil imports from iraq and kuwait and halted 
japanese exports to both countries tokyo said it would suspend all 
loans to iraq and kuwait ban japanese investment there and freeze 
iraqi assets in japan japan which imports 99 percent of its oil 
had relied on iraq and kuwait for more than 11 percent of its oil 
imports 
the white house praised japan for joining the many other nations 
that have already penalized iraq for its invasion by imposing 
economic sanctions 
in new york the united states urged other un members at 
talks to impose broad economic and military sanctions on iraq 
western diplomats said the world body is expected to adopt the 
measures monday 
the emir of kuwait sheik jaber alahmed alsabah made his 
first public statements since fleeing to saudi arabia on thursday 
in a speech broadcast on bahrain and saudi television the emir 
pledged that kuwait would restore its territorial integrity 
independence and sovereignty he said what makes our hearts 
filled with sadness is that the source of this unjustified 
agression was not an enemy but a brother and a close neighbor 
 
arab nations remained divided over how to react to the iraqi 
invasion and there was no indication that saudi arabia and turkey 
were prepared to close the pipelines in their countries that carry 
the oil exported by iraq 
in ankara the turkish capital iraqi deputy prime minister taha 
yassin ramadan warned that shutting down the pipeline would 
create mistrust between iraq and turkey 
prime minister mudar badran of jordan a us and iraqi ally 
said sunday his nation would not recognize the provisional 
government in kuwait because that would hinder arab efforts to 
settle the crisis through negotiation 
in syria iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati met with 
president hafez assad to discuss ways of ensuring an iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait according to official reports syria was 
persian irans main arab backer during its 198088 war with iraq

agreement between baghdad and kuwaits provisional government

news agency told other countries to refrain from taking 
punishing measures against it or iraq the government said 
these countries have to remember they have interests and citizens 
in kuwait and said it was prepared to close embassies and cut 
diplomatic relations with offending nations

americans still living in kuwait has already banned oil imports 
from kuwait and iraq and frozen both countries assets in the 
united states

it would be the first time since 1967 it has taken such action 
against a member state the last time such sanctions were imposed 
was against the white minority government of rhodesia 
western diplomats said they expected up to 14 positive votes on 
the 15member council for sanctions against iraq they said they 
expected no vetoes allowing the legally binding measure to be 
adopted probably on monday they said cuba was the holdout 
us ambassador thomas r pickering told reporters after 
closeddoor talks sunday that the council discussed the absolute 
necessity of moving ahead toward a broad resolution of sanctions 
he said he expected a vote monday

drafts of a detailed resolution it calls for an embargo on iraqs 
oil exports an embargo on imports to iraq and a halt to all arms 
and other military supplies for iraq 
british ambassador crispen tickell told reporters later that he 
detected strong support with the exception of one member for 
action and a vote tomorrow

statement carried by the iraqi news agency told other countries to 
refrain from taking punishing measures against it or iraq the 
provisional government said countries have to remember they have

an unemployed oil equipment salesman claims 
that his late father a former dallas police officer was one of 
three men who assassinated president john f kennedy in 1963 
ricky white scheduled a meeting with reporters monday in dallas 
to offer evidence he said implicates his father roscoe white in 
the assassination the austin americanstatesman reported sunday 
the warren commission concluded that lee harvey oswald acting 
alone fired the shots that killed kennedy and wounded texas gov 
john connally despite the commissions findings conspiracy 
theories have abounded over 27 years 
white 29 said he had no conception of ever ever giving this 
story out but decided to do so after the fbi began questioning 
him in may 1988 in relation to his claims 
woody specht fbi special agent in dallas refused to comment on 
the claims other than to say you really need to evaluate the 
source on these types of things 
white said he can prove that his father fired two of the three 
bullets that killed the president and that his father not oswald 
also killed dallas police officer jd tippit less than an hour 
after the assassination 
white said oswald was involved in the plot but did not fire any 
shots the two other shooters were referred to in his fathers 
diary only by code names white said 
roscoe white died in a fire in 1971 
the evidence white reportedly will provide includes a rifle with 
telescopic sight that uses ammunition he said is similar to that 
used in oswalds gun records showing oswald and white served 
together in the marines and three faded messages he believes were 
sent by us intelligence officials ordering kennedys 
assassination in dallas in november 1963 
bobby inman the former deputy cia director viewed the messages 
and told the americanstatesman they were not genuine 
white an unemployed equipment salesman in midland said that he 
and his mother read his fathers diary which detailed the 
assassination his mother geneva white is seriously ill and 
unable to be interviewed family members told the newspaper 
the diary disappeared from his home after it was inspected by 
the fbi white says 
white said his mother worked briefly at jack rubys carousel 
club in dallas ruby fatally shot oswald two days after kennedy was 
assassinated 
clues found among his fathers effects and available government 
records show that roscoe white and oswald served together in the 
us marine corps in the late 1950s ricky white said he said his 
father claimed to have become acquainted with oswald in japan and 
the philippines 
he said his fathers possessions also included a photograph 
taken by marina oswald of her husband lee harvey oswald holding a 
rifle in the back yard of their dallas home in 1963 
oswald was discharged in 1959 and defected to the soviet union 
he returned to the united states in 1962 settling first in fort 
worth before moving to dallas 
the elder white was discharged in late 1962 and joined his wife 
and two sons in paris texas ricky white says his family later 
moved to dallas where his father sold insurance 
dallas police records show that on oct 7 1963 roscoe white 
joined the department as a photographer and clerk and that he 
became a patrol officer in 1964 
white says his father shot from behind a fence atop the grassy 
knoll that was to the right and front of kennedys limousine when 
he was shot he says the other two gunmen were behind the limousine 
in the texas school book depository where oswald also was and in 
a second building 
as the incriminating evidence began to mount against his father 
ricky white asked the jfk assassination information center in 
dallas to verify or disprove his fathers involvement center 
director larry howard told the associated press the information 
center is a private group that has pursued the idea of a conspiracy 
and coverup in kennedys death 
hes actually very courageous to follow this thing through 
howard said sunday the amount of documentation we have to back 
his story up is just incredible 
howard said he has been working with white for 1 years and 
hopes whites story will lead to a new investigation of the 
assassination 
ive never been so convinced of anything in my life howard 
said 
were not saying that weve solved the john f kennedy 
assassination case but this sure opens the doors to another 
investigation 
howard said americans are fascinated by jfks assassination i 
think they know that it was a massive coverup in the very beginning 
and they want to know the truth he said

iraq exports much of its oil through 
pipelines across saudi arabia and turkey with the rest shipped via 
the persian gulf all three routes are highly vulnerable 
the 27 billion twin pipeline through saudi arabia which ends 
at the red sea oil terminal at almuajjis has a capacity of 165 
million barrels a day 
the 979mile pipeline was a central element in iraqs plan to 
seek alternative oil routes during the iraniraq war when iranian 
raids on gulf shipping almost shut down sea routes 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer has described the pipeline as a 
symbol of the deep ties between the two countries 
another pipeline with a capacity of 16 million barrels a day 
snakes through 612 miles of southeastern turkey to the 
mediterranean oil terminal at ceyhan 
oil shipped through the gulf passes through iraqs mina albakr 
terminal which when postwar rebuilding work is completed will 
have a design capacity to load 16 million barrels a day into 
tankers its current capacity is 800000 barrels 
but with the united states japan and the european community 
announcing embargos on iraqi oil after iraqs invasion thursday of 
kuwait the question is whether president saddam hussein will be 
able to sell it 
in addition the pipelines are highly vulnerable to military 
attack and their operation depends on the cooperation of saudi 
arabia and turkey 
so far those two countries have given no indication of any 
willingness to interfere with the oil flow with saudi arabia 
reportedly fearful that any such action could provide baghdad with 
a pretext to send its army into the oilrich kingdom 
but the possibility remains 
as for the gulf route the iraniraq war demonstrated vividly 
that it can be virtually shut down by military aircraft missiles 
gunboats and possibly a naval blockade 
at times during the eightyear gulf war with iran iraqs oil 
output fell below 1 million barrels a day but now it ranks again 
among the worlds oil giants 
iraq itself has increased its production capacity to 45 million 
barrels a day although it has kept its output no higher than its 
organization of petroleum exporting countries quota of 314 million 
barrels a day 
kuwaits violation of its opec quota was one factor that pushed 
oil prices down sparking saddams anger and costing baghdad losses 
of 14 billion iraq said 
kuwait has an opec quota of 15 million barrels of oil a day but 
had been producing up to 19 million barrels a day and it has 
capacity to produce even more 
iraq has more than 100 billion barrels of oil reserves while 
tiny kuwait itself floats on a sea of 94 billion barrels of oil 
both countries however still rely on foreign expertise both to 
extract the oil and to conduct exploration work the western 
sanctions will eliminate much of this assistance

a 16 million super clinic that 
opened at malmstrom air force base three months ago isnt getting 
full use because strict air force regulations disqualify most local 
doctors from working there 
airmen and their families are being treated at two local 
hospitals at greater expense by the same doctors 
its ironic said dr peter horst a private urologist 
the air force is perfectly comfortable with us doing the same 
work at local hospitals that we cant do at the new base clinic 
the clinic has been billed as the first nonhospital in the 
military designed for outpatient surgery that civilian hospitals 
offer 
twenty great falls physicians won contracts totaling about 
600000 to perform surgery at the new base clinic in addition to 
their other work 
but the air force has more stringent standards for physicians 
who conduct socalled major surgery such as hernia repairs than 
either columbus hospital or the montana deaconess medical center 
some of the surgeons tabbed to work at the air force clinic plan 
to upgrade their medical certification but 12 anesthesiologists 
have balked at other air force requirements like a dress code and 
mandatory aids test 
horst estimated the certification would require two to 10 hours 
of study and a few hours of testing 
the problem was discovered in april when paperwork was being 
signed 
we assumed the standards for downtown providers are the same 
as for the air force but they werent said col ronald burnett 
clinic commander 
the service standards are more rigorous than at other montana 
hospitals and by the commission that accredits most civilian 
hospitals said dr john highsmith chief of clinical services at 
malmstrom 
the reason for the air force standards is not clear but the air 
force has refused to grant malmstrom a waiver 
a primary air force requirement is that all doctors working in 
highrisk fields to be certified in advanced cardiac life support 
only one of the 20 great falls doctors has such certification 
they obviously have the skills but may need a refresher 
course highsmith said it will be a formality to most of them 
but its a required formality 
malmstrom offered a certification course in june but most of 
the doctors could not rearrange their schedules on short notice 
the air force is paying 1500 to run another course wednesday 
seven doctors had signed up last week 
anesthesiologists are required for major surgery but the 12 
local specialists decided against working at the clinic because of 
the dress code and aids test and increased demand for their 
services at the citys hospitals said dr fred fleming 
malmstrom may have to hire resident anesthesiologists a process 
that could take months burnett said

a judge may be asked this week to decide 
whether a faint message was inserted into the blasting soundtrack 
of a heavymetal rock album and whether that message drove two 
troubled youths to try suicide 
attorneys for the families of raymond belknap and james vance 
concede there is not overwhelming scientific evidence to support 
their claim that such subliminal words can be comprehended by a 
persons unconscious mind and cause dramatic consequences 
the families case against the british rock band judas priest 
and cbs records is expected to conclude this week then washoe 
district judge jerry carr whitehead will decide if the bands 
stained class album does contain hidden messages and if so 
whether they contributed to the youths deaths 
belknap 18 died on dec 23 1985 after firing a sawedoff 
shotgun in his mouth vance then 20 blew away the lower portion 
of his face he underwent numerous reconstructive surgeries before 
dying on thanksgiving day 1988 of complications from his injuries 
and a reaction to medications 
neither side disputes that the youths drank beer smoked 
marijuana and listened to the judas priest album before shooting 
themselves 
and they dont disagree that the use of drugs and alcohol 
contributed to the young mens fates 
there are few additional points of agreement 
the defense maintains the youths substance abuse family 
violence brushes with the law and personality disorders 
predestined their suicides 
attorneys for the families contend it was the judas priest 
album specifically the alleged subliminal message do it on the 
song better by you better than me a song dealing with 
suicide that pushed them over the edge 
ken mckenna and vivian lynch representing the families offered 
the testimony of a university of michigan psychology professor to 
support their case 
howard shevrin said that while the youths had a predisposition 
toward taking their lives they would not have tried without the 
subliminal messages he said such a message issued in the form of a 
command such as do it can create a compulsion that renders a 
person helpless to deny it 
they had no choice ms lynch said they were compelled to 
do what they did it was totally beyond their control 
but shevrins testimony relied on the opinion of another 
witness william nickloff that the hidden messages exist masked 
by the pounding music 
defense attorneys suellen fulstone and bill peterson challenged 
nickloffs credibility saying he held a degree in marine biology 
and lacked expertise to pass judgment on the musics content 
the band denies subliminal messages exist on the album 
lead singer rob halford gave a 10second courtroom concert 
singing two lines from better by you better than me to 
exhibit his explosive breathing style he said the alleged do 
it was no more than an exhalation combined with guitars and drums 
additional defense witnesses countered that the whole idea of 
auditory subliminal messages is nonsense because it is impossible 
to record below the frequency of white noise a low hissing 
found on all recordings 
still others said the brain cannot perceive anything it cant 
hear 
you hear what you hear stanford university medical school 
psychiatrist donald lunde said we dont have more than one mind 
up there it either hears it perceives it and registers it or it 
doesnt 
the judge ruled the song lyrics are protected by the first 
amendment and are not on trial but allowed the plaintiffs to 
present testimony regarding themes found in heavy metal music 
ms lynch said the musics underlying themes focus on death 
rebellion and suicide and therefore are relevant because they 
enhance the predispositions of listeners many of whom are 
teenagers 
mckenna said the plaintiffs won a small victory last week when 
halford said under oath he used reversed lyrics on a song in a 
judas priest album recorded seven years after stained class

gasoline dealers paid 95 cents more per 
gallon last week for regular unleaded gasoline following the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait a survey of suppliers said sunday 
the lundberg survey of wholesale prices the amount gasoline 
dealers pay for their product showed nationwide average prices 
checked friday rose to 765 cents a gallon among the most 
pricesensitive wholesalers 
the survey is taken weekly of about 75 percent to 80 percent of 
suppliers of refined gasoline in the united states 
figures gathered since friday indicate a weekend of increases 
rough estimates show prices from the most pricesensitive suppliers 
have gone up another 6 cents survey chief trilby lundberg said 
sunday 
crude oil bought at last weeks higher prices wont be refined 
and flowing from us gasoline pumps for about a month but 
lundberg and an oil company spokesman said increases in the spot 
market for gasoline translate into higher pump prices more quickly 
during the summer 
many oil companies sell more gasoline than they refine during 
the heavydriving summer months so they have to supplement their 
supplies by buying on the volitile spot market said john lord a 
spokesman for mobil oil co in new york 
the refinery industry is cranking out every gallon of gasoline 
it can and still has to buy on the spot market the impact on the 
gasoline distributing system is faster than ever lundberg said 
lord also said many are apparently anticipating higher costs 
from the iraqkuwait conflict 
when you know future costs are going to go up if you can 
recover some of those costs today youre going to do it if the 
price will hold lord said i think thats whats going on in 
the marketplace 
other increases over the week for the same grade of gasoline 
were 473 cents for 745 cents a gallon for middlemarket 
distributors and 255 cents for just over 78 cents a gallon for 
the most stable part of the market 
since friday estimates show prices in the middle market have 
risen 325 cents and 350 cents for the upper or most stable 
market lundberg said 
the most pricesensitive are the independent wholesalers that 
have few if any longterm contracts with gasoline dealers and 
meet demand by getting supplies on the spot market 
the most stable are those who deliver branded gasoline to 
stations under a contract their higher base price allows more of a 
cushion before changes affect their costs
