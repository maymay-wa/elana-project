a former funeral director was 
sentenced friday to 28 years and 11 months in prison for burying 
the dead with trash in their coffins or without prepaid vaults 
robertson county circuit judge john peay sentenced bobby wilks 
less than three weeks after wilks pleaded guilty to 48 counts of 
burial fraud 
wilks 53 entered the pleas to a 71count indictment on oct 11 
and opted for sentencing by a judge rather than face a jury trial 
prosecutors said 
relatives of the burial victims had called for a harsh sentence 
for the millsdale mortician 
exhumations last fall revealed more than 25 bodies buried by 
wilks business had been buried improperly in robertson and sumner 
counties and simpson county ky

the trial of former exxon valdez 
skipper joseph hazelwood will be held in anchorage despite defense 
claims that it will be hard to field an impartial jury in this port 
city 
if oliver north can get a fair trial im sure capt hazelwood 
can get a fair trial too anchorage superior court judge karl 
johnstone said at a hearing friday 
prosecutors had earlier agreed that valdez where the tanker 
picked up its load before causing the nations worst oil spill 
march 24 was an inappropriate site for the trial 
hazelwoods lawyer dick madson of fairbanks argued that an 
opinion poll showed that inland fairbanks was the city most likely 
to offer a fair trial he said people in anchorage which lies on 
the coast about 350 miles south of fairbanks were more likely to 
be influenced by ties to maritime industries affected by the spill 
anchorage prosecutor brent cole pushed for his city saying it 
offered a much bigger pool of potential jurors the citys 
population of 250000 is about five times the size of fairbanks 
hazelwood faces misdemeanor and felony charges stemming from the 
crash of the tanker in prince william sound exxon fired the 
skipper soon after the ship struck a charted reef and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil polluting miles of 
shoreline and killing wildlife 
the trial on charges of recklessness negligent discharge of oil 
and operating a vessel while intoxicated is scheduled to open jan 
22 and is likely to last at least three weeks 
hazelwood who lives in huntington ny listened to fridays 
hearing by telephone from a new york law office

the energy department is suspending commercial 
shipments of tritium for the second time in four months because of 
another unexplained loss of the material used in nuclear warheads 
rep edward j markey dmass lambasted the department friday 
saying it had bungled the investigation at the oak ridge national 
laboratory in oak ridge tenn 
you have to wonder what kind of keystone kops operation the 
department of energy has down at oak ridge when they lose more than 
22000 curies of tritium in a test designed to find out why doe 
keeps on losing track of tritium he said a curie is the unit 
used to measure radioactivity 
the department usually sells about 56 million of tritium a 
year to private companies that use it in research and the 
manufacture of luminous lights and dials 
most tritium however is used as a vital component in nuclear 
warheads 
for now were on hold on making further shipments said oak 
ridge spokesman jim alexander 
murray rosenthal deputy director of the lab said in a 
telephone interview that investigators had not ruled out the 
possibility the material was stolen he said however that there 
was no evidence of theft and that a more likely explanation was 
that the equipment that handles the gas had developed an air leak 
rosenthal said shipments were suspended oct 5 shortly after it 
was discovered that a small amount of tritium shipped to a 
commercial customer in california was missing no date has been set 
for resuming shipments rosenthal said 
spokesmen at department headquarters in washington said they had 
no firm information about the situation at oak ridge they said 
questions about missing tritium and the oak ridge operation were 
being reviewed by energy secretary james d watkins 
senior officials directly involved in the issue declined to 
accept a reporters phone calls 
the department announced a halt in shipments from oak ridge in 
july after an inconclusive search for about 5 grams of tritium that 
lab records said had been shipped to commercial customers but that 
buyers said never arrived shipments resumed in august although 
not all of the lost material had been recovered 
an internal lab report on efforts last summer to account for the 
missing material said theft was possible but unlikely 
a copy of the confidential report and related oak ridge 
documents were obtained by the associated press earlier this week 
under a freedom of information act request 
investigators for martin marietta energy systems inc which 
runs oak ridge under an energy department contract said in the 
july report that a significant amount of tritium was lost during a 
test shipment between lab buildings 
based on figures in the report it appeared the loss amounted to 
about 2 grams thats about half the amount needed to make a single 
atomic warhead according to private analysts 
the test shipment was arranged as part of a broader effort to 
find reasons for the shipping discrepancies 
workers loaded tritium into a container sent it across the lab 
to another building unloaded part of it for sampling reloaded it 
sent it back to the original building and unloaded it again for 
reasons not yet publicly explained threequarters of the tritium 
was lost in the round trip 
leakage from the containers and other procedural problems were 
ruled out

the chairman of a house panel investigating 
allegations of wrongdoing at hud during the reagan administration 
says its inquiry is likely to end soon but that the subcommittee 
has shown there was a colossal scandal at the agency 
i have high hopes the justice department will do its duty 
subcommittee chairman rep tom lantos dcalif said friday after 
former hud secretary samuel r pierce jr again refused to testify 
lantos excused pierce from a subpoena requiring another 
appearance next week and said the panel faced with a refusal to 
testify from three other former top hud officials would soon end 
its inquiry 
the subcommittee lantos said had demonstrated a colossal 
scandal existed at the department of housing and urban 
development during the reaga administration the panel is 
investigating allegations of fraud influencepeddling and 
mismanagement 
lantos said the subcommittee doesnt plan to offer immunity from 
prosecution to pierce or his former aides as a way of compelling 
them to testify though that remains an option 
pierce invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination for a second time friday and some lawmakers 
called for a special prosecutor 
now its clear that sam pierce is stonewalling said rep 
charles schumer dny our only choice now is to take the 
process from the legislative arena and move it into the arena of an 
independent counsel 
pierce said he wants to tell his story but refused to answer any 
questions saying he had been made a target of the subcommittees 
investigation and unfairly accused of alleged lies and 
dishonesty 
i look forward to the time when innuendoes and rumors to the 
contrary are put to rest he said i look forward to the time 
when i can tell my story and i can assure you i do have a story to 
tell 
pierce testified voluntarily before the panel in may but he 
refused to testify last month when the panel subpoenaed him to 
answer questions about what members say are inconsistencies and 
contradictions between his and other witnesses testimony 
lantos put a series of questions to pierce including one about 
a former hud officials contradiction of the former secretarys 
testimony that he did not influence the selection of hud subsidy 
awards 
pierce called the question unfair and refused to answer 
rep christopher shays rconn said pierces earlier testimony 
on that point could be perjury and told pierce it was in your 
best interest to answer 
after pierces latest refusal schumer and rep bruce morrison 
dconn both members of the house judiciary committee said they 
would seek a vote to formally ask the justice department to name a 
special prosecutor to investigate pierce 
only a majority of the members of either party on the judiciary 
committee is required to initiate a formal process requiring a 
review of the request and response by attorney general dick 
thornburgh schumer said 
i think its clear from these hearings that there is 
criminal activity at hud in the area of defrauding of the federal 
government conspiracy to defraud the government and we may well 
have perjury said rep bruce morrison dconn 
lantos meanwhile disclosed that pierce had asked hud to pay 
his legal expenses stemming from the congressional probe hud 
secretary jack kemp rejected the request lantos said

americans doing business with panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega could face up to a 12year prison sentence 
under a bush administration declaration naming him an agent of cuba 
noriega his wife felicidad sieiro de noriega and 32 companies 
including several hotels and airport dutyfree shops are being 
added to the list of 134 businesses and individuals already 
identified as cuban agents in panama the treasury department 
announced friday 
this action is another step in the united states efforts to 
halt the channeling of funds to the illegal regime of gen noriega 
and to neutralize cuban commercial activities in panama that serve 
to circumvent the us trade embargo against cuba the 
announcement said 
fourteen names including noriega associate carlos duque were 
added to the list sept 20 
under a world war i statute the united states has banned trade 
by americans with cuba since 1960 violations of that embargo or 
similar bans against trade with cambodia north korea and vietnam 
can result in fines up to 500000 against us corporations and up 
to 250000 against individuals who can also be imprisoned for a 
maximum of 12 years 
the latest action serves to underscore the administrations 
resolve to undermine the extensive network of commercial and 
financial collusion between the noriega and castro regimes 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity last week 
had revealed that the designation was imminent the officials said 
they had begun examining ways to bring new pressure to bear on 
noriega even before an abortive coup attempt oct 3 
but the administration has been reluctant to use extreme 
measures such as a trade embargo out of concern that hundreds of 
american companies in panama would go bankrupt 
the new sanction is narrowly targeted at noriega and his 
business partners and is not expected to do major damage to 
panamas economy 
it is not clear how extensive american business dealings are 
with the companies linked to noriega cuba has found these 
companies useful to import high technology usmade items which 
otherwise would be beyond cubas reach because of the trade embargo 
the companies also have served as conduits for illegal cuban 
exports to the united states

turmoil appears to be growing at top levels of 
the energy department spurred in part by secretary james d 
watkins frustration at ineffective leadership in the office 
overseeing production of nuclear weapons 
in an internal memorandum obtained by the associated press on 
friday watkins told the departments no 3 official john tuck to 
assume temporarily the added title of head of defense programs 
which runs the nuclear weapons system 
the defense programs office has been without a permanent 
director for more than a year 
the vital national security mission of the department can no 
longer be carried out under the current management arrangement 
watkins wrote adding that tucks assignment was designed to give 
the office leadership and direction 
the central problem for watkins is that his choice to be 
permanent head of the weapons office victor stello has been 
unable to gain senate confirmation 
stello was nominated by the white house in july but a 
confirmation hearing by the senate armed services committee has not 
been scheduled 
stello has been sharply criticized by environmentalists and some 
members of congress for being lax on nuclear safety although he 
calls the charge unfair 
watkins said he hoped the stello nomination would be acted upon 
soon but one environmental group opposed to stello said it 
appeared watkins was anticipating the possibility that stello 
either would be blocked by congress or dropped by the white house 
hes doomed said stephen schwartz a spokesman for 
greenpeace usa 
also friday watkins announced the resignation of robert o 
hunter jr as director of the office of energy research hunter had 
drawn criticism in some scientific circles for his efforts to 
restructure the departments fusion research program 
no replacement was announced 
in a related development advisers told watkins on friday that 
the department may be moving too quickly in its plans for 
restarting the three idled savannah river nuclear reactors that 
produce a gas needed in nuclear warheads 
in a letter to watkins members of the advisory committee on 
nuclear facility safety said that while prospects for a safe 
resumption of production at savannah river had improved in recent 
months a number of serious problems remained 
the chief concern was that training of westinghouse corp 
workers who operate the reactors has not included reactor 
fundamentals learned by operators of commercial nuclear reactors 
westinghouse runs savannah river under a government contract 
the savannah river reactors built for the government in the 
early 1950s were closed down more 18 months ago because of 
mechanical problems and safety concerns among the major issues in 
planning a restart is whether the operators are adequately trained 
and whether westinghouse puts enough emphasis on safety 
the advisers told watkins that while restart planning was 
generally good the absence of operator training in reactor 
fundamentals was a serious problem 
that this omission will remain through restart may belie 
westinghouses claim that safety is their primary concern and that 
early restart of the reactors is not the driving factor in 
training the letter said 
in addition the committee members said watkins may be biting 
off more than he can chew in trying to get all three idled reactors 
back in operation within a sixmonth period starting next summer or 
fall 
it might be wiser they said to focus all the best available 
talent on restarting one reactor before focusing on another

exxon is resigning from the national wildlife 
federations corporate advisory panel because it says the 
conservation group has been unfairly critical of the exxon valdez 
oil spill along the alaskan coast 
the federation said friday that it regrets the resignation but 
issued a stinging response that called exxon a corporate pariah 
that should keep an open dialogue with environmentalists 
the federation with 58 million members nationwide has been 
one of the sharpest critics of exxons handling of the 11 million 
gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of repeatedly 
ignoring requests to meet and discuss it 
the march 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline 
along alaskas southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and 
the fishing industry 
exxon usa was one of the charter members of the corporate 
conservation council a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the 
national wildlife federation to foster frank and open 
discussions between industry and the federations leaders 
among the 15 members on the panel are top executives of general 
motors corp monsanto co dow chemical usa dupont arco miller 
brewing co and tenneco inc 
raymond campion exxons environmental coordinator said in a 
letter to the federation that the conservation group had not met 
our expectations in seeking solutions to the nations 
environmental problems 
recent public actions by you regarding the valdez oil spill 
have failed to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness 
campion wrote federation president jay hair 
the federation was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in 
august against exxon seeking full payment of environmental recovery 
costs from the spill 
hair returned from alaska in september with a pile of 
oilstained rocks and distributed them to each member of congress 
to dramatize what a number of environmentalists feel are 
shortcomings in exxons attempts to clean alaskas beaches of oil 
i regret we did not meet your expectations but did you 
really think your membership on our corporate conservation council 
would buy exxon immunity from the national wildlife federations 
response to such a massive and poorly managed environmental 
disaster hair wrote in a reply to campions letter 
the fact that exxon has been judged a corporate pariah in the 
court of public opinion has little or nothing to do with the 
national wildlife federation he wrote that distinction has 
been clearly earned by exxons leadership 
the federation made public the exchange 
hair said in a statement that the resignation typifies the 
insularity of exxon management 
instead of engaging in a constructive dialogue with the 
environmental community over this tragedy exxons leaders 
apparently would rather complain about how unfairly we have treated 
them 
hair said the corporate council was established to promote 
exchanges between environmentalists and corporate leaders in an 
atmosphere of cooperation and respect 
in our view exxon desperately needs this forum now more than 
ever hair said

journalists should do a better job of 
balancing privacy and first amendment rights says a woman who 
accused the media of badgering her family after her daughter was 
murdered 
however reporters and editors who participated in the same free 
speech seminar said most journalists are sensitive about how their 
story might affect the private lives of people they write about 
reporters and editors in the past tended to go with it and 
worry about the consequences tomorrow said bob mccord senior 
editor at the arkansas gazette it doesnt seem to be like that 
anymore 
about 60 journalists media lawyers and others attended fridays 
seminar sponsored by the first amendment congress an umbrella 
organization for 16 national media and communications groups the 
organization tries to educate the public about first amendment 
issues 
patsy day who founded a victims support group after her 
14yearold daughter was murdered in 1985 criticized the media for 
publishing her address and camping outside her home with television 
crews 
she said she was badgered by a reporter who wanted to film her 
daughters bedroom and the media questioned whether she and her 
husband had violated child labor laws by letting her daughter work 
in the donut shop where she was abducted 
one of the big gripes i have with the press is that they apply 
the same standards to crime victims as to public officials who 
are derelict in their duties mrs day said 
the journalists said there were no clear guidelines for deciding 
when privacy concerns outweighed the need to have a fact in the 
story 
for years and years that collision of privacy needs and the 
need to know has been occurring on every level and it comes down to 
a judgment call said paul mcmasters deputy editorial director 
of usa today 
mcmasters said reporters have to be careful not to have a 
nonchalant attitude about privacy rights 
steven mcgonigle a reporter for the dallas morning news said 
he seeks colleagues opinions when he has qualms about invading 
someones privacy 
its foolish and arrogant of us to make decisions that affect 
peoples lives in a vacuum and hopefully most of us dont 
mcgonigle said 
the group also discussed hurdles reporters face in trying to 
gain access to government documents and potential changes to 
freedom of information laws that are supposed to guarantee the 
publics access to information 
for instance arkansas open meetings and records law was 
recently changed to seal certain corporate tax documents and 
another effort at a crippling amendment is under way mccord 
said 
powerful politicians are still out there and theyre still our 
enemy he said

behind the fanfare surrounding the visit of former 
president ronald reagan and his wife nancy there is a clear 
message tokyo values harmonious ties with the united states and 
sees reagan as the catalyst 
the reagans hosts the huge fujisankei communications group and 
the japanese government showered their guests with lavish praise 
during their nineday 7 million visit which ends saturday 
fujisankei reportedly paid reagan 2 million 
reagan in turn glossed over serious trade disputes in his 
speeches with expressions of affection for the japanese people 
however in a speech scheduled to be delivered at the end of his 
visit reagan said americans did not think their products had fair 
access to japan and that trade barriers must be lowered to avoid 
rising anger in the united states 
as a friend i tell you that americans are not as patient as 
the japanese reagan said in his speech according to the new 
york times 
officials here have welcomed the opportunity to emphasize 
positive aspects of sometimes rocky usjapanese ties 
president reagan symbolizes usjapan friendship said 
yukio okamoto director of the foreign ministrys north american 
division 
as emperor akihito looked on the government showed its 
appreciation for reagans role in promoting good ties with japan 
and in fighting trade protectionism in office by awarding him one 
of its highest honors the grand cordon of the supreme order of the 
chrysanthemum 
the only other us president to receive the award was dwight 
eisenhower 
mrs reagan has been honored during the visit for her antidrug 
program and for her support for her husband 
reagan 78 is the only former us president to receive such 
regal treatment officials said because unlike his predecessors 
who either left office in disgrace or after losing elections 
reagan served the two full terms and left office as a popular 
leader 
there is nothing controversial about inviting reagan 
president reagan still carries high prestige among the american 
people okamoto said 
the reagans enjoy enormous prestige in japan reagans dignified 
demeanor coupled with the image of the two former movie stars 
standing handinhand captures romantic imaginations in a country 
that revels in the pomp of lavish wedding ceremonies and royalty 
at concerts banquets and other gatherings of japans rich and 
powerful the reagans have received trumpet fanfares standing 
ovations and warm smiles youll never know ron how much we 
need you please come here with nancy to stay audience and 
performers sang to the tune of you are my sunshine on sunday at 
a concert to benefit the ronald reagan presidential library 
a capacity crowd of 56000 cheered as reagan tossed the 
ceremonial first pitch in a japanese championship baseball game 
tuesday 
rather than criticizing tokyo for trade barriers which 
washington says contributed to japans 52 billion trade surplus 
with the united states last year reagan spoke of a golden age 
for japan in his speeches 
trade issues he said were a few little itchy things here and 
there that we still need working on from both sides 
americans as the worlds largest foreign investors should 
welcome japanese investments in the united states reagan said he 
said sony corps takeover of columbia pictures could help bring 
back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that are being 
made 
a newsweek survey following the takeover indicated that 
americans view japans economic power as a greater threat than 
soviet military might 
while reagan has occasionally reminded listeners here that 
having retired he no longer speaks for the us government 
officials of the japanese government have welcomed his words of 
praise his optimism and his playing down of economic disputes 
we need a communicator of reagans prestige and ability 
said foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe we respect him 
and we love him 
reagans conservative probusiness ideology and his opposition 
to protectionist trade policies have enormous appeal in japan 
particularly with the couples host the fujisankei group which is 
known for the conservative nationalist outlook of its chairman 
nobutaka shikanai and of its media outlets 
a fujisankei official said shikanai wanted to bring reagan in 
and give him a chance to talk to the japanese people in hopes 
the visit would smooth over some problem areas

the bush administration is trying to distance 
itself from allegations made by a salvadoran army defector that top 
salvadoran military leaders ordered death squad killings and us 
advisers ignored the activity 
the white house said the us embassy in el salvador is looking 
into the charges made this week by cesar vielman joya martinez 28 
who admits to taking part in eight death squad murders from april 
to july 
he claims to have seen reports from el salvadors joint chiefs 
of staff ordering 72 executions during the same period 
joya martinez also said two american advisers assigned to the 
intelligence unit at the 1st infantry brigade in the capital of san 
salvador obviously had to know what was going on 
were concerned about it white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said friday ambassador william walker is looking 
into it 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
departed from normal procedure of not commenting on investigations 
in progress he strongly denied any us complicity and said a 
salvadoran government probe into human rights abuses by its 
military has not revealed any evidence substantiating joya 
martinezs statements 
the pentagon called the statements about us military 
involvement patently absurd the cia declined to comment 
saying as a matter of policy we dont comment on intelligence 
matters 
the us armed forces have 55 military advisers assigned to el 
salvador the cia has an unknown number of agents in the central 
american nation 
on friday joya martinez and his attorney william van wyke 
walked from office to office on capitol hill volunteering to 
testify about the death squads 
among others he spoke with staff members of sen alan cranston 
dcalif an outspoken critic of death squad activity in el 
salvador the staff members declined to comment pending a report to 
the senator 
the accusations could complicate upcoming congressional debate 
on new aid to el salvador which so far this decade has received 
more than 3 billion in us economic and military assistance 
lawmakers made earlier aid contingent on human rights improvements 
by the salvadoran military which has been blamed by church groups 
for murdering thousands of suspected leftists and leftist 
sympathizers 
the salvadoran military denies joya martinezs claims and any 
other involvement in the death squads 
my work was to execute these people joya martinez said 
adding that he was part of a sevenman group that operated out of 
the salvadoran armys 1st infantry brigade in the capital of san 
salvador 
joya martinez who is seeking asylum in the united states said 
he went public to stop the killing the salvadoran army says he is 
wanted for two murders in july in el salvador 
in el salvador testimony obtained friday said some of joya 
martinezs comrades told a judge investigating the murders of two 
civilians that the army deserter was the most zealous of torturers 
who beat drowned or suffocated prisoners 
marxistled guerrillas have been fighting the usbacked 
government in el salvador since 1979

a man walked into a government building 
in medellin friday whipped out a submachine gun and killed a 
leftist leader of the antioquia state assembly before being slain 
by guards police said 
the victim gabriel jaime santamaria was state leader of the 
leftist patriotic union whose ranks have been decimated the last 
four years by death squads believed to be operated by drug 
traffickers 
the slaying came less than 24 hours after the patriotic union 
refused to support a proposal by drug traffickers to negotiate an 
end to the violence that has plagued colombia since midaugust 
the leftist party said it could never condone amnesty for 
traffickers implicated in the murders of hundreds of its members 
including its president jaime pardo leal in 1987 
earlier friday hundreds of policemen and soldiers with 
automatic weapons had manned checkpoints in major cities after a 
bomb killed five policemen and injured 16 others in the cocaine 
center of medellin 
also a police officer died in a bomb explosion at a private 
airport at a police air base six miles north of bogota the 
national radio network caracol reported 
unidentified terrorists fled after placing the dynamite bomb in 
a bathroom of the guaymaral airport terminal caracol said 
three other bombs exploded in bogota late thursday and early 
friday injuring one person and two bombs were deactivated in 
bogota and barranquilla the police said 
santamaria was sitting at his desk in the apuajara government 
building in the heart of medellin when he was killed at 330 pm 
the medellin police said in a telephone interview medellin 150 
miles north of this capital is the hub of the most powerful 
colombian cocaine cartel 
the government building includes the offices of the antioquia 
state governor many of the state assembly members and the mayor of 
medellin a city of 2 million residents 
the gunman was killed in a hail of gunfire from guards who 
belong to colombias secret police a spokesman for the medellin 
police told the associated press speaking on condition of not 
being named 
the assassin was about 20 years old the police spokesman said 
three persons believed to be accompanying the gunman were 
arrested he said 
santamaria was the 737th member of the patriotic union to be 
killed since the party was organized in 1975 as part of an attempt 
by the federal government to reach a truce with leftist guerrillas 
the traffickers are believed to have set up the death squads 
after leftist guerrillas kidnapped the sister of three medellin 
cartel leaders and were paid 10 million for her return 
a survey by a colombian polling company showed that colombians 
heavily favor the government starting talks with drug traffickers 
to end the violence president virgilio barco has rejected such 
talks 
the bomb in medellin exploded thursday night as a police bus 
carried patrolmen to their posts in medellin 
the driver and four other policemen were killed as chunks of 
shrapnel tore through the bus said the medellin police chief col 
humberto camero 
afterward the most rigid security measures seen since the 
government declared war on drug traffickers aug 19 were put into 
force in colombias five largest cities bogota medellin cali 
barranquilla and cartagena 
an ap reporter on his way to work friday in bogota was stopped 
at three checkpoints by soldiers and police searching cars for 
explosives and guns 
jeeps mounted with machine guns patrolled parts of the capital 
extra troops and policemen guarded police stations and army 
bases 
the bomb in medellin an estimated 65 pounds of dynamite was 
set off by remote control about 730 pm as the police bus passed 
by camero said 
with the driver fatally wounded the bus careened out of control 
and smashed into a taxi the colonel said no one in the car was 
injured 
no one claimed responsibility for the bombing but suspicion 
fell on drug traffickers 
the traffickers are the only criminals with the means and the 
desire to carry out an attack of this size said a police 
lieutenant in medellin speaking on condition he not be identified 
government security forces have assumed that the scores of bombs 
that have exploded in colombia in the last two months are part of 
the drug traffickers campaign to persuade the government to stop 
extraditing trafficking suspects to the united states 
the government has extradited four colombians and nine more are 
awaiting extradition 
in the last two months there have been 169 bombings which have 
killed 21 people and injured 219 
in bogota a poll by the private national consulting center 
indicated 61 percent of colombians aged 18 to 60 want the 
government to negotiate a truce with drug traffickers

the bush administration says in a pessimistic 
assessment of trade prospects that the trade deficit may grow next 
year 
the current account deficit the broadest measure of the us 
trade measuring investment flows as well as payments for goods and 
services narrowed sharply in 1988 to 1266 billion down from a 
record 1437 billion in 1987 
but progress has stalled this year with the gap running at only 
a slightly better 1228 billion annual rate from january through 
june 
the administration in a report prepared by the treasury 
department released friday warned that the current account deficit 
may start widening again unless the group of seven industrial 
nations the united states japan west germany great britain 
france canada and italy do a better job of coordinating economic 
policies including currency exchange rates 
it would appear further improvement in the us current 
account position in 1990 if any is to occur at all is likely at 
best to be very modest treasury said in its semiannual report 
to the congress on international economic and exchange rate 
policy 
furthermore the possibility of deterioration in the current 
account next year cannot be excluded 
a key element in the fight to reduce the us trade deficit has 
been group of seven efforts this year to check a rise in the value 
of the dollar a strong dollar can hurt the trade deficit by making 
american goods more expensive overseas and foreign imports cheaper 
on us markets 
the treasury report acknowledged that skepticism among currency 
traders is hindering the effort 
the group of seven launched a new effort to contain the dollar 
in midseptember which included dollar selling and interest rate 
increases in japan and west germany however the report noted that 
it took the oct 13 stock selloff in the united states to subdue 
the dollar 
the report was prepared under a provision of the trade act of 
1988 that requires the administration to look for currency 
manipulation by american competitors in world trade and to 
negotiate to halt such practices 
under the law the administration has singled out south korea 
and taiwan fridays report expressed approval of taiwans effort 
to boost its currency and lower its trade surplus but sharply 
criticized south korea 
the two countries have for many years used part of the money 
earned through their trade surpluses to buy and sell currencies on 
the open market to keep their own currencies weak in relation to 
the dollar making their products cheaper for americans than they 
would otherwise be 
however the treasury report noted that the taiwanese dollar has 
appreciated 12 percent over the past year against the us dollar 
it said taiwan put in place a new exchange rate system in april and 
took other significant steps to curb its trade surplus 
we are encouraged by these significant steps it said 
despite an appreciation of the south korean currency won in 
1988 the report rebuked south korea for the 075 percent decline 
in the value of that currency since april

calamity jane was an uneducated 
uncultured woman and some frontier heroes were shameless bigots 
according to an iconoclastic conference titled speaking ill of 
the dead jerks in montana history 
nearly every event in the life of the true calamity jane 
martha jane canary is clouded by contradictory evidence dan 
gallacher told the annual montana history conference on friday 
even her birth date and parents names are suspect 
much of the legend of calamity jane as a swashbuckling frontier 
woman who rode with general custer and captured wild bill hickocks 
killer was built by canary herself who fed lurid stories to 
newspapers that didnt care if they were true he said 
fridays panel on jerks in the states history also featured the 
golden hatchet award which went to lyndel meikle whose 
research showed that many of montanas founding fathers were racist 
and sexist 
the panel drew a crowd of nearly 200 and may become an annual 
part of the conference 
conference organizer jennifer jeffries thompson was pleased but 
also distressed that the scholarly work of the meeting would go 
unnoticed 
the same sort of thing happened in september she said when a 
society program was upstaged by the great montana centennial cattle 
drive 
this is the cattle drive of the history conference thompson 
said 
gallacher a historian with historical research associates in 
missoula said much of the legend of calamity jane can be flatly 
disproved 
her claim to have been a cavalry scout for george armstrong 
custer in arizona is easily debunked he said because custer never 
served in arizona 
and despite the many tales about her and hickock including 
that she was married to him the only verifiable fact is that both 
were in deadwood sd when hickock was shot to death in 1876 
it was pure fantasy that she captured hickocks killer jack 
mccall gallacher said 
meikle a ranger at the grantkohrs ranch national historic site 
southwest of helena dug into official records that revealed the 
prejudices of delegates to montanas original constitutional 
convention in 1889 
cj hartman one of montanas founding fathers wanted a 
requirement that anyone allowed to vote should be able to read 
english he saw that as a safeguard against the scum of foreign 
nations who were being admitted to the united states meikle said 
delegate charles s warren would have allowed only some 
foreigners to vote but not italians 
the official transcript meikle said notes that delegates 
laughed and applauded as warren read an article that he said voiced 
his feelings 
it is somewhat uncomfortable to reflect that a citizen of 
intelligence property good moral character and a keen sense of 
responsibilities and dignities of his duties as an american citizen 
may have his ballot offset by an italian 
warrens prejudice against italians was not unusual and similar 
racism was aimed at the chinese meikle said 
women faced different barriers she said they were not 
considered people 
when a proposal to let women vote was introduced at the 1889 
convention a mr collins of cascade county requested that its 
supporters first introduce a motion that a woman is a human being 
or person in the language of the court 
to their credit meikle said the delegates devoted a 
tremendous portion of their time to the debate on womans suffrage 
it is not to their credit however that they didnt grant it

the longrunning squabble on the proposed 
capital gains tax cut that continues to stymie senate action on 
several bills has led democrats to accuse the administration of 
undermining the nations credit rating abroad by doggedly pursuing 
the issue 
there apparently is no limit to what theyll do to get a 
capitalgains cut senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine told reporters friday 
white house budget director richard g darman responded to the 
criticism with a lecture about the need for statesmanship 
we need people in congress to get back to their better selves 
in all of this darman said 
the issue is blocking senate action on bills to provide economic 
assistance to poland and hungary and to raise the federal debt 
limit so the government can continue to borrow money 
it also is slowing work by senate and house negotiators on a 
compromise bill to reduce the budget deficit 
the treasury department stepped in friday with a plan to ensure 
that social security checks will go out next week even if congress 
and the president are unable to agree on a higher debt limit the 
department announced it will borrow 176 billion on an emergency 
basis monday 
fridays announcement was considerably less dramatic than 
treasurys disclosure 24 hours earlier that it was taking the 
unprecedented step of emergency borrowing the earlier statement 
had been read as indicating 17 billion in new borrowing would be 
required monday 
in fact treasury will be raising its credit needs by only 2 
billion monday the remaining 156 billion will be raised in the 
usual monday auctions of 3 and 6month securities the only 
difference is that buyers will have to pay for those securities 
tuesday rather than thursday as usually would be the case 
that money will be used to keep the government going after 
tuesday night when federal credit authority drops from 287 
trillion to 28 trillion the extra 176 billion from securities 
sales is expected to carry the government for another week through 
nov 7 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee described the emergency borrowing as an unprecedented 
gamble 
i dont see how such an action can fail to undermine 
confidence in our financial operations he said 
he said there was no danger congress would fail to raise the 
debt ceiling or would do anything else to jeopardize government 
checks for 389 million social security recipients 
the chairman of the house ways and means committee rep dan 
rostenkowski dill asked treasury secretary nicholas brady to 
explain his actions in writing by monday on the unusual borrowing 
action 
i view this as a serious matter he said in a letter to 
brady 
at bushs urging the house voted last month to tax capital 
gains profits from the sale of stocks and other investments at 
a lower rate than applies to wages and other income the house 
attached the cut to a bill designed chiefly to reduce the budget 
deficit 
senate republicans have developed with bushs backing a new 
plan for cutting capitalgains cuts the chief sponsor sen bob 
packwood rore says as many as 44 republicans and 12 democrats 
a majority of the senate favor his bill but he acknowledges he 
does not have the 60 votes that would be required to end a 
democratic filibuster against it

a major earthquake registering 72 on the 
richter scale shook the solomon islands in the south pacific today 
the us geological survey says 
the preliminary reading of 72 is slightly stronger than the 71 
magnitude earthquake that hit the san francisco bay area oct 17 
the earthquake struck the islands at 805 am today or 505 
pm edt friday said usgs spokesman don finley it was the largest 
earthquake in the solomons since a 74 quake on nov 5 1978 
there were no immediate reports of injury or damage major 
earthquakes in the solomons usually dont cause much damage or many 
casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not 
extensively developed 
the pacific tsunami warning center in honolulu said no 
pacificwide tsunami popularly called a tidal wave was 
generated by the quake but some areas might see small changes in 
sea levels 
saturdays earthquake was the strongest in the world in five 
months finley said an 83 quake hit the macquarie islands south 
of australia on may 23 
the surveys earthquake monitors in golden colo said early 
seismograph readings placed the epicenter of saturdays earthquake 
about 200 miles southeast of honiaria which is on guadacanal 
island and is the capital of the solomons 
that places the earthquake just east of san cristobal the 
easternmost island in the solomons chain and about 1300 miles 
northeast of brisbane australia 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

planned to fix them but overlooked the similar interstate 880 
viaduct says a top state highway engineer 
interstate 880 in oakland the oldest of the doubledecker 
freeways in northern california was missed because nobody in the 
department of transportation remembered until after last weeks 
earthquake that it too might have the flaw in its upper support 
column hinges caltrans chief structural engineer jim roberts said 
friday 
two scientific teams from the university of california at 
berkeley and ucsan diego have tentatively decided that the hinges 
or joints sheared off during the quake allowed i880s upper deck 
to slam down killing at least 39 motorists 
roberts was asked during a press briefing whether the repair 
planned for san franciscos doubledeckers would have prevented the 
i880 collapse 
the answer i believe is affirmative he said i think it 
would have gone a long way 
but roberts noted that even if i880 had been on the list 
repairs would not have been done prior to oct 17 
hinge repairs on the three other doubledeckers the 
embarcadero china basin and central freeways will be expedited 
officials said the three highways were damaged in the quake and 
are temporarily closed 
engineers discovered the hinge flaw in the embarcadero freeway 
during an august review by seismic experts on whether the structure 
needed more earthquakeproofing of its horizontal decking roberts 
said he confirmed the contents of an aug 21 internal memorandum 
brought to his attention thursday 
the memo from one of his engineers to another turned up in a 
flood of departmental documents turned over to the news media this 
week roberts earlier had denied its accuracy 
the memo states that at roberts request the other two san 
francisco freeways would be added to the list because state 
engineers recalled that they too contained the flaw 
asked how engineers could have forgotten the oldest of these 
structures i880 roberts said maybe it was the lack of 
foresight 
thats hindsight he said later 
many of the states 700 multicolumn structures need column 
bolstering but engineers are waiting to do so until technology in 
the works at ucberkeley has been developed roberts said 
engineers plan to temporarily strengthen the three san francisco 
structures however by attaching to the flawed columns strong 
backs or splints much as a physician stabilizes a leg 
roberts said 
he was asked why that could not be done with all 700 elevated 
structures 
the splints are not very good looking and youre not going to 
leave them up permanently he said

an arabamerican organization is planning 
weekend demonstrations to protest a decision by a novelty company 
to continue selling two halloween masks the group finds offensive 
the american arab antidiscrimination committee said members 
would demonstrate at spencer gifts inc outlets because the company 
decided to put its sheik and arafat masks back on the 
market 
the pleasantville njbased company had earlier this month 
withdrawn the masks for sale at its 435 outlets after a threeday 
protest and telephone campaign by the committee 
on friday spencer general counsel ronald mangel said in a 
letter to aaadc spokesman faris bouhafa that the company decided to 
put the masks back on sale but would not reorder them for next year 
the essence of halloween is exaggeration mangel said 
earlier its not an ethnic mask its a character mask 
in its halloween catalog spencer urged customers to put on 
our arafat mask and terrorize your friends 
the arab group characterized the ad as an exhortation that 
reinforces the negative and increasingly discredited stereotypical 
image of palestinians as terrorists

leaders of the countrys oldest and largest 
hispanic organization voted friday to clean house after 
learning that 88000 had been funneled through an undisclosed 
account officials say 
the national executive board of directors of the league of 
united latin american citizens voted after a daylong closed meeting 
friday to create a new foundation and strip the old foundation of 
its taxexempt status said ruben sandoval special counsel to 
lulac president jose garcia de lara 
but the fight over the old foundation managed by former 
presidents of lulac to receive corporate donations for the groups 
charitable works appears to have caused an angry rift among some 
members of the san antonio texasbased organization of 140000 
its bitterly divided very bitterly said nelda ojeda 
savoy president of a washington dc lulac council texas has 
always tried to manipulate and control lulac 
de lara initiated efforts to replace the foundation with a new 
entity after discovering in march a previously undisclosed account 
through which 88000 most of it corporate donations had been 
funneled said sandoval

in just a few seconds on oct 17 untold 
numbers of windows were shattered trapping pedestrians in glass 
storms and sending shards spitting through homes and businesses i 
magnins department store alone lost 73 plate glass windows to the 
earthquake 
some of the windows have been replaced some boarded up and some 
ignored the amount of glass needed to help in the recovery exceeds 
supplies on hand in most cases and that has strained the glass 
pipeline 
we are small but we lost all our stock said h behrouz 
office manager for city glass express and kaiser glass both of 
which closed for four days to clean up the mess left by the quake 
we had over 15000 worth of stock on hand when it shook 
all our glass and mirrors fell from the racks he said we 
still havent got the replacement glass we need 
the system is definitely strained said bob hansen manager 
for national glass 
but four of the nations big glass manufacturers are on the west 
coast and replacements are on the way no one has statistics on 
just how many windows shattered 
libbeyowensford in lathrop began increasing shipments the day 
after the quake although the company was also damaged said randy 
zatrock manager of customer service we almost doubled what we 
would have shipped for the week 
zatrock said the company lost about 250000 square feet of 
glass the equivalent of 10000 fivefootsquare windows 
the 71magnitude quake blamed for more than 60 deaths more 
than 3000 injuries and damage that could exceed 71 billion was 
felt strongly at lathrop 90 miles south of the epicenter near 
santa cruz 
there was dust everywhere zatrock said 
while distributors struggled to deliver glass through a network 
of closed or damaged freeways installers set up a system to handle 
the the most dangerous breaks first and let cracks wait 
in june 1906 after the great quake ravaged san francisco 
habenicht and howlett opened for business to fill the demand for 
glass that followed the company is having little trouble getting 
glass this time although some sizes are in short supply said 
manager don post 
there was definitely a lot of breakage it seems like the 
older buildings had most of the damage the newer buildings have 
thicker glass and different types of safety glass post said 
in 1906 he said none of the glass manufacturers were on the 
west coast and the availability of glass was not what it is today 
there was a lot more destruction in 1906

a young man opened fire with a 
submachine gun in a heavily guarded state government building in 
medellin killing a leftist political leader 
hours later a bomb exploded at a police air base near bogota 
killing a police officer 
gabriel jaime santamaria vice president of the antioquia state 
assembly was talking on the telephone in his office friday when an 
unidentified man walked in and shot him killing him instantly 
police said 
the office is on the second floor of medellins main government 
building which also houses the offices of the antioquia state 
governor and the citys mayor the downtown building is patrolled 
by scores of police officers army troops and private security 
guards 
medellin a city of two million in northwest colombia is the 
capital of antioquia state and is considered the center of the 
countrys drug trade 
guards shot and killed the assassin in an exchange of gunfire 
that left two officers wounded a police spokesman said from the 
region 
police arrested three men suspected of assisting in the attack 
he said on condition of anonymity 
santamaria also was state leader of the leftist patriotic union 
the ranks of which have been decimated in the last four years by 
death squads believed operated by drug traffickers 
it was carried out by the same narcofascists that have 
murdered hundreds of our leaders patriotic union president diego 
montana said the most suprising thing was that an assassin 
carrying a submachine gun could walk into the most heavily guarded 
government building in medellin 
hours after the slaying a bomb exploded at a police air base 
and private airport six miles north of bogota killing a police 
officer according to the national radio network caracol 
unidentified terrorists fled after placing the dynamite bomb in 
a bathroom of the guaymaral airport terminal caracol said it also 
caused extensive damage to the building 
police are using the small private airport to store many light 
aircraft seized from suspected drug traffickers in a government 
crackdown on narcotics that began in august 
a bogota police spokesman could not confirm the bombing because 
communication with the airport was cut he said 
earlier friday the government announced it would increase to 
600000 the reward offered for information leading to the arrest 
of pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha two leaders of the 
medellin cartel 
in august the administration of president virgilio barco offered 
250000 for information leading to the suspects capture 
us officials say the medellin cartel and a rival organization 
in southern cali are responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine sold 
in the united states 
the government declared a crackdown on drug traffickers on aug 
19 a day after leading presidential candidate sen luis carlos 
galan was assassinated by drug barons the government reinstated 
an extradition treaty with the united states and began confiscating 
property belonging to the drug lords 
traffickers responded with bombings and assassinations in an 
effort to persuade the government led by president virgilio barco 
to end its extradition of drug suspects 
the administration has extradited four alleged traffickers to 
the united states where they will face trial in colombia drug 
lords have received relative impunity by paying off or intimidating 
the nations judges 
on thursday five patrolmen died and 16 were injured when a bomb 
attributed to traffickers exploded beside a bus carrying them to 
their night posts in medellin 
security was stepped up nationwide as a result of the bombing 
in bogota on friday military checkpoints were increased and jeeps 
mounted with machine guns patrolled the streets

the third game of the world series played 
to a captive audience in red cross shelters where televisions were 
set up for baseball fans left homeless by the earthquake 
this is definitely not the place id like to watch the game 
said william johnson 53 as he sat on a cot in the crowded 
gymnasium of oaklands lowell middle school 
but due to the circumstances its not so bad the as fan 
said if it wasnt for this place i wouldnt be watching at 
all 
sounds of an ebullient candlestick park crowd blasted out from 
the tv echoing to every corner of the cavernous gym where 120 
cots were lined up side by side 
some officials questioned the wisdom of resuming the world 
series while some people remain homeless in the san francisco bay 
area but in the shelters baseball fans were happy to watch the 
oakland athletics beat the san francisco giants 137 calling it a 
welcome break from what they called depressing footage of 
destruction 
we love it it takes your mind off the earthquake and thats 
good for the nerves said winston presley 54 as he sat with a 
cluster of as fans 
when the earthquake hit last week presley was just about to 
turn on the televised game in his room on the third floor of 
oaklands lowrent woodrow hotel 
hed have preferred to be there watching fridays game but his 
quakedamaged building was condemned presley was forced into the 
shelter and his tv was stolen before he was allowed back to his 
room to pick up his belongings 
not everyone in the shelter was glued to the television during 
fridays game many people milled around their cots others escaped 
the shelters smelly noisy confines to enjoy the crisp clear 
evening outside 
raymond smith 48 lay disconsolate on his cot far from the 
blaring set 
i cant watch the game because of my heart he said smith 
complained that officials were giving him the runaround in finding 
a more permanent place to stay and in supplying him with the 
prescription drug he needs for his heart condition 
the world series held no magic for him all i want is a place 
to stay

the meat was offbeat the diners chic but 
picketers outside the new deal restaurant were in a pique 
it was the place to be friday night where else in town could 
you find sweet and sour ostrich kangaroo yakitori and beaver 
empanada on the menu with animal rights activists chanting 
lions tongue is no fun in the street 
the restaurants eighth annual wildlife game festival attracted 
customers who wanted to savor a rare taste treat it also drew the 
attention of an animal rights group that protested in front of the 
restaurant shouting slogans such as wild game is not a treat 
this is symbolic of the really decadent disrespectful 
attitude that unfortunately our society exhibits said steve 
siegel of transspecies unlimited some of them are endangered 
animals theyre making a game out of it making a fun experience 
out of the suffering of these animals 
the kangaroo meat served by new deal is marinated in soy sauce 
and grilled with scallions the drunken diamondback rattlesnake 
is panroasted with cilantro coriander and bell peppers and then 
baked in tequila and lime 
barbara and bill hinton regulars at the eatery in manhattans 
soho area were seated at the bar friday night 
we had zebra once which was quite delicious said hinton 
they have some things here that you cant get in other places in 
the city and its very tasty and very well prepared 
as the protestors continued their chanting chef jeffrey nathan 
and restaurant partner harvey riezenman lamented that the 
demonstrators were misinformed 
they think were doing something illegal said riezenman 
everything is sanctioned by the government no one drives up here 
in a truck with three deer on the back of the truck and dumps it 
out on the street 
added nathan we too are concerned with the protection of our 
wildlife we do not feature endangered species our exotic 
meats come from preserves whose sole purpose is to raise these 
animals for consumption 
but protester sari bailer was unimpressed 
those animals dont belong on a plate they belong on the open 
fields or the jungle she said as she took up a new chant 
beaver moose and ostrich too new deal restaurant shame on 
you 
game will be on the menu until january and chef nathan intends 
to hold the festival again next year especially with the 
popularity of highprotein lowcholesterol food 
its a healthier product than the meat you get in most 
restaurants he said in here youre not eating animals that 
are all pumped up with hormones or antibiotics 
but how can anyone eat kangaroo a visitor asked 
its like filet mignon nathan said 
but every taste bud has its limits 
i particularly have a morbid fear of snakes and ive never 
eaten it and i probably never will bill hinton said

audrey ellis is a 20yearold mother with another 
child due in february she is also one of six pregnant homeless 
women to enter beth israel hospital in just 10 days 
the distress of such women represents a surge so alarming it 
prompted dr benjamin sachs chief of obstetrics and gynecology at 
beth israel to call friday for more attention to the needs of 
homeless pregnant women 
now this may be a statistical quirk but im just outraged 
what kind of a society is this he said 
ive never seen this number before i hear about a case once 
in a blue moon perhaps once or twice a year said sachs who has 
worked in boston hospitals for 11 years in some ways it must be 
coincidence but its highlighted by the times when i read the 
headlines i have to make an outcry 
sachs said that among the six pregnant homeless women two have 
already given birth one of those two women left her child behind 
at the hospital to be put in foster care 
and there is ms ellis a diabetic who has a 3yearold daughter 
and has been homeless since july the stress made her so ill she 
checked into beth israel 
its a lot of pressure ms ellis said in an interview from 
the hospital where the staff is helping her obtain a state housing 
subsidy a difficult feat at a time of budget cuts 
i see mothers every day put out every day from the shelters 
and i see them prostituting to feed their children she said 
its very scary because you dont know whats going to happen 
the next day she said its also in a way very painful my 
3yearold wakes up crying wondering where she is 
the size of the problem is difficult to gauge many homeless 
pregnant women might not disclose their predicament for fear of 
having their children placed in foster care sachs said 
but in a report soon to be released by the national coalition 
for the homeless a survey of 26 communities from new york city to 
fargo nd to st louis and los angeles found that more than 35 
percent of the homeless were families with children said joan 
alker a legislative analyst in washington for the coalition 
while no statistics were collected specifically on homeless 
women giving birth alker said the fastest growing segment of 
the homeless population is families with children

six former secretaries of state agreed 
that rapid political changes in the eastern bloc pose tough foreign 
policy questions for the west but they couldnt say whether the 
cold war is dead 
we shouldnt be incessantly euphoric about all the welcome 
changes alexander haig told the panel discussion haig henry 
kissinger and dean rusk said they did not believe the cold war was 
over despite warmer ties between the united states and the soviet 
union and displays of nationalism and changes in leadership in 
eastern europe 
edmund muskie said the cold war was maybe over william 
rogers said im closer to a yes while cyrus vance said 
its ending 
vance who served under former president carter said such 
developments as the noncommunist leadership in poland and the 
exodus from east germany indicate a demise of the cold war 
mentality 
in the cold war these could never have happened vance said 
the former officials met friday at bates college for the seventh 
annual report of the secretaries of state presented by the 
atlantabased southern center for international studies 
i would say its ending but were not out of the cold war 
vance said 
the secretaries agreed that soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs 
reform efforts are welcome but they were not sure what us 
leaders can or should do to assist 
nobody knows what perestroika is including gorbachev so 
nobody knows what were supposed to be supporting said 
kissinger who served under former presidents nixon and ford 
trying to help gorbachev could backfire by causing him political 
problems at home some of the speakers said 
the best we can do is assist mr gorbachev at the margins 
haig said 
muskie the former maine senator who also served as secretary of 
state under carter suggested that the soviets need to help 
integrate themselves with the economies of the west by making the 
ruble exchangeable with other currencies 
asked whether the bush administration is responding quickly 
enough to the changes in eastern europe vance said he would like 
to see bush speed up his reactions while haig encouraged a 
cautious approach 
in hartford conn paul h nitze a retired diplomat 
ambassador and arms control negotiator friday expressed a lack of 
trust in gorbachev saying the soviet leader is very good at 
keeping people deceived as to what hes going to do next 
nitze said gorbachev has essentially become a oneman 
dictator 
nobody can stand up to him today said nitze and i dont 
approve of oneman dictatorships even if they might look as though 
theyre heading in a benevolent direction toward their own people 
you never can tell about dictators 
we want to be sure that the things that hes suggesting do in 
fact take place before we let down our guard nitze said 
before a speech to the world affairs center a group of businessmen 
and civic leaders interested in foreign policy 
the 82yearold nitze who served as former president reagans 
adviser on arms control retired from the state department on april 
30 and now is diplomat in residence at the paul h nitze school of 
advanced international studies at johns hopkins university in

as firefighters doused smoldering 
buildings a caravan of buses ferried 960 inmates from the scorched 
camp hill prison to other crowded facilities in the state today 
after two nights of rioting 
the siege left more than 100 people injured numerous buildings 
razed or damaged by fire and hundreds of inmates without cells 
five hostages were released friday morning after state police 
stormed the prison and retook it building by building 
it looks like a riottorn city in there said firefighter 
george smith 
with large areas of the prison gutted or damaged officials had 
little choice but to begin shuttling busloads of inmates to other 
state prisons all of which are already full beyond capacity 
prison officials said overcrowding at camp hill may have been a 
cause for the riots 
there were no deaths and no escapes during the uprising at the 
prison in southcentral pennsylvania about 100 miles west of 
philadelphia officials said 
the violence was sparked wednesday by an inmates assault on a 
prison worker that led to a sevenhour rampage during which eight 
hostages were taken and 47 injured 
officials regained control of the prison and the hostages were 
released but by 7 pm thursday the inmates managed to free 
themselves from lockdown and began the second night of rioting 
ken robinson spokesman for the state department of corrections 
said officials are unsure how the inmates freed themselves there 
has been speculation inmates still had keys gained in the first 
night of rioting or took advantage of locks damaged the first night 
the sieges end came friday morning when state police firing 
guns stormed a kitchen building wounding at least one inmate as 
they began taking control of the prison 
robinson announced about 930 am that officials were again 
in control of the institution nearly 15 hours after the second 
wave of rioting began 
fourteen of 31 buildings on the grounds were burned out 
including eight modular housing units the education building 
greenhouse laundry building and furniture factory robinson said 
during their storming of the prison state police in riot gear 
and armed with shotguns pushed surrendering or captured prisoners 
to the ground holding them facedown in the grass of a prison 
courtyard 
troopers who spoke on the condition of anonymity detailed 
handtohand scuffles and counterattacks by inmates 
they were throwing molotov cocktails at us and pieces of 
blocks said one trooper 
robinson said 76 people were injured thursday and 46 were taken 
to hospitals they included 34 prison employees 32 inmates and 10 
state police or firefighters 
all five hostages taken thursday night were injured one was in 
serious condition with a stab wound three were in stable condition 
with head injuries or in one case broken ribs and one was in 
good condition with a head injury he said 
an 18yearold inmate was in critical condition a 24yearold 
inmate was in serious condition and a third inmate of undetermined 
age was in fair condition all with gunshot wounds area hospital 
officials said 
a 41yearold guard was listed in serious condition at the 
medical center after undergoing surgery for multiple stab wounds to 
the back hershey medical center spokeswoman marybeth bruchwalski 
said 
friday afternoon the corrections department said 960 inmates 
from camp hill would be moved to the graterford mercer 
pittsburgh smithfield and waymart state prisons 
overcrowding and a shortage of guards may have contributed to 
the disturbance officials said camp hill with 2600 inmates was 
about 45 percent over capacity and the entire state prison system 
is about 48 percent over capacity 
robinson said both a prison administrative and a criminal 
investigation have begun to determine what happened during the 
outburst the states senate judiciary committee plans a hearing 
next week 
state department of corrections superintendent robert m freeman 
had said the first nights problems may have been linked to a 
decision to prohibit families from bringing food to inmates during 
extended visits he also said inmates were upset by a change in the 
way they received medical care

candlestick park shook again but it was the 
roar of fans cheering the world series not another earthquake 
and the only cracks came from bats as the bay area took a break 
from its woes to watch baseball 
the citys back just like the world series san francisco 
mayor art agnos declared to the television audience before the 
oakland athletics pounded his giants 137 friday night to take a 
30 lead in the series 
it was the loss of the tv signal shortly before game 3 was to 
begin 10 days earlier that gave the nation its first hint of the 
powerful temblor that rocked northern california killing scores 
and causing widespread damage 
were well on the way to recovery although its early yet 
because there have been so many aftershocks said oakland mayor 
lionel wilson 
the 62000 fans stood silently to remember victims of the 
71magnitude quake that hit at 504 pm oct 17 then jubilantly 
sang san francisco before a dozen rescue workers were given the 
honor of throwing out first balls 
not everyone thought the bay bridge world series should resume 
in the face of the enormity of the tragedy 64 deaths six people 
unaccounted for nearly 14000 people homeless and an estimated 
71 billion in damage 
but majorleague baseball thought it was time to play ball and 
many fans agreed 
we all feel bad for the people who got hurt but this game 
means its ok to be yourself again said ray torres who with a 
friend had seats near the top of the stadium and brought a banner 
that read upper deck parachute rental many fans wore hard 
hats to the game 
i think enough time has passed so that we can put it behind 
us said lawyer mike franchetti at a tailgate party in the same 
spot where he had been on oct 17 its an escape from the 
sadness and uncertainty 
commissioner fay vincent who announced a 14 million gift from 
baseball to earthquake relief said he received mail from around 
the country urging that the series be called off because of the 
earthquake 
vincent said he understood those feelings but i dont think 
there is any disrespect in going on with the world series he 
said 
baseball can be part of this areas mental therapy said 
giants manager roger craig 
the death toll rose to 64 on friday with the addition of an 
88yearold san mateo woman who died of a heart attack shortly 
after the quake 
demolition continued at interstate 880 in oakland where 39 
people were known to have been killed in the collapse of the 
doubledeck freeway the search for more more bodies was delayed 
because the road was too shaky 
in other quake developments 
dockworker buck helm 57 rescued after four days trapped in 
the rubble of i880 remained in serious condition in oaklands 
highland general hospital helm was making slow progress in 
kidney and respiratory functions nursing supervisor grace reece 
said late friday 
julio berumen 6 whose leg was amputated during a rescue from 
i880 was in good condition at childrens hospital in oakland a

iran has quietly stopped flooding part of 
its ceasefire line with iraq ending a yearlong dispute between 
tehran and the united nations over the truce violation 
the flooding had sparked the deadliest shelling across the line 
since the 1988 ceasefire that effectively ended the 8year persian 
gulf war under the truce the two armies are not allowed to 
strengthen their positions 
the news came friday as new mediation efforts began to break a 
deadlock in peace talks between iran and iraq 
the security council called on iran and iraq to work 
constructively and in a spirit of good will with un envoy jan 
eliasson who monday begins a threeweek shuttle diplomacy mission 
between tehran and baghdad 
diplomats said water levels along the 40milelong area 
northeast of basra dropped dramatically over the last two to three 
weeks and parts of the marsh are now dry 
they said they were not sure why tehran had stopped the 
flooding which began three weeks after the ceasefire to drive 
iraqi troops from positions they occupy in iranian territory iran 
has not commented on the move 
in september 1988 iran opened a large canal turning the marshy 
region into swampland beneath 4 feet of water making it 
impassable for iraqi tanks or armored vehicles according to un 
military observers 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar called the flooding a 
serious violation of the ceasefire agreement and tension over the 
raised water levels provoked shelling in december 1988 that killed 
two iranians 
perez de cuellar said un envoy eliasson is not taking 
specific proposals but will be listening to all parties concerned 
who will be available to him 
the war between iran and iraq tentatively ended with a truce 
effective aug 20 1988 but peace talks in geneva quickly bogged 
down 
an uneasy truce prevails along the 350mile war front and the 
warring armies are separated by a un iraniraq military observer 
group 
baghdad says that since hostilities have ceased all prisoners 
of war should immediately be exchanged according to the terms of 
the geneva conventions of 1949 governing the treatment of pows 
about 100000 prisoners still languish in pow camps 
but tehran insists the next step in the peace process must be 
the withdrawal of troops to the border iraq still occupies about 
385 square miles of iranian territory

former colleagues of a 
salvadoran army deserter who told washington officials about 
deathsquad assassinations testified the man was a zealous torturer 
who initiated the killings 
the testimony obtained friday was given in recent weeks to 
judge miguel flores figueroa of quetzaltepeque 12 miles north of 
san salvador 
cesar vielman joya martinez who deserted from the san 
salvadorbased 1st army brigade in july met in washington friday 
with members of congress 
he has said he was part of a rightist death squad responsible 
for killing 72 suspected leftists the government and armed forces 
deny the existence of military death squads 
joya fled el salvador after being charged with the deaths of 
suspected leftwing guerrillas lucio parada and hector miranda who 
were killed after being captured by joyas army brigade 
in the testimony col francisco elena fuentes 1st brigade 
commander called joya a deserter a murderer and a liar 
joya 28 told reporters on thursday my work was only to 
execute these people my job was to kill or be killed i realize 
i was manipulated he said some of the people he killed were 
almost dead from being beaten during interrogation 
but joyas former army colleagues told the judge that joya an 
army intelligence officer was the most zealous of torturers who 
beat drowned or suffocated prisoners 
parada and miranda were among eight guerrilla suspects captured 
during an operation around the village of tres ceibas 
soldiers who took part in the operation testified that all eight 
were beaten and several were almost drowned by joya over two days 
of interrogation even though the battalion commander had said they 
were not to be tortured 
lt herbert soriano commander of the atlacatl battalion company 
operating north of the capital reportedly warned joya who 
replied if i dont they wont tell us anything 
gomez and another soldier eugenio mendez said soriano told 
joya after the deaths youre in big trouble 
soriano said a squad from his company accompanied joya in making 
the arrests at tres ceibas but their only mission was to give 
security to the two 1st brigade soldiers so they could perform 
their intelligencegathering duty 
an estimated 70000 people mostly civilians have been killed 
in the 10yearold war between leftist rebels and usbacked 
governments 
human rights groups have said rightist death squads allegedly 
sponsored or tolerated by the military killed more than 20000 
suspected leftists in the early 1980s the number of slayings 
attributed to the squads declined between 1984 and 1987 but 
increased again last year

a woman whose imprisonment for hiring a 
gunman to kill her husband led to changes in state laws protecting 
battered women was free today on a grant of clemency 
delia alaniz blinked back tears as she walked through prison 
gates friday afternoon saying her prayers for mercy and 
understanding had been answered 
the governor put trust in me and im not going to let him 
down she told reporters outside the purdy corrections center for 
women 
alaniz had served about 22 months of a 10 year threemonth 
sentence for hiring a hit man to kill her husband roy 
gov booth gardner granting the first clemency order of his 
five years in office said alaniz and her four children had 
suffered enough and society wouldnt be threatened by her early 
release 
skagit county public defender robert jones who defended alaniz 
called the clemency order an extraordinary act done for an 
extraordinary case there is room in our law and room in our 
hearts for forgiveness and understanding 
gardner said he did not condone alanizs action but felt the 
order would increase public awareness of the tragedy of spouse 
abuse 
my first thought was id be united with my children alaniz 
told reporters outside the prison 20 miles southwest of seattle 
weve been through a lot in the past due to our separation 
weve suffered a lot when i got word i would be free i thought i 
finally will be home with my kids i had faith it was going to 
happen 
alaniz was met at the gates by her 16yearold daughter dominga 
the two left the prison together to join two of her other children 
at hickman house a seattle transition house for battered women 
her fourth child will join the family at a later date said 
edith maffeo a spokeswoman at hickman house 
no one condones or approves the action taken to end years of 
abuse jones said this is not a pardon this is not sending 
the message you can take the law into in your own hands 
alanizs lawyers said roy alaniz beat and threatened his wife 
and the children caused a miscarriage chopped off her hair raped 
her put a gun to her head threatened to drown her and sexually 
physically and psychologically abused the children 
alaniz said her attempts to flee to get police protection or 
to get any extensive help from shelters for battered women were 
fruitless and she felt she had no alternative but to have her 
husband killed 
she admitted hiring michael earls 22 to shoot her husband in 
their family home in sedro woolley north of seattle on march 31 
1987 while she and the children were upstairs she agreed to give 
earls 200 a vcr that didnt work and an old volkswagen that 
didnt work 
earls is serving a 30year prison term 
alaniz initially was charged with aggravated firstdegree 
murder which carries the possibility of the death penalty 
but after she detailed the years of abuse the charge was 
reduced to seconddegree murder and she pleaded guilty 
at the time alaniz faced trial evidence of a history of abuse 
could be used as a defense only if the person killed the abuser in 
selfdefense during an actual or imminent attack 
prompted by her case the washington legislature passed a 
measure giving lighter sentences to abuse victims who strike back 
at their tormenters

prince charles the architecture critic who would 
be king has set up a summer school to promote his own ideas about 
design 
the first fiveweek prince of wales summer school in civil 
architecture will be held next summer according to an announcement 
friday from essex university which is administering the 
postgraduate course 
architecture students from britain europe and north america who 
have completed at least their bachelors degrees will be eligible 
to apply for 24 places in the course which will include three 
weeks in oxford and two weeks in rome 
students will pay 1600 for the course all other costs will be 
met by funds raised privately by the prince who is expected to 
visit the course and may attend some of the classes according to 
jules lubbock the schools director 
in the course prospectus prince charles writes that 
architecture students are not properly exposed to classical design 
those rare students courageous enough to pursue this approach 
on their own are sometimes browbeaten by their tutors luckier ones 
are merely ridiculed as freaks the prince wrote 
the course will concentrate on four disciplines civic design 
and building codes invention and design within codes building 
materials and craft and life drawing 
learning to draw the subtleties of the human body is the 
timehonored way of tutoring the hand in the delicate lines of 
beauty and harmonic proportion the prospectus said 
lubbock said prince charles decided to sponsor a school after he 
spent two years working on a television documentary a vision of 
britain in which the heir to britains throne toured the country 
praising neoclassical design and pointing out architectural 
carbuncles 
an exhibition at the victoria and albert museum and a book both 
titled a vision of britain elaborated on the principles that 
will be the basis for the summer school 
some prominent architects have taken sharp exception to charles 
architectural enthusiasms but a vision of britain is now on 
the bestseller list 
in the course prospectus charles writes that design students 
need to realize the role their buildings will play within their 
environments 
the philosophy of designing buildings from the inside out has 
had the effect of tearing apart the fabric of our cities in a 
jostling scrum of buildings of outlandish shapes and materials and 
all kinds of heights and sizes screeching for attention like a 
classroom of unruly children he wrote 
some of the money for the school is expected to come from the 
1851 exhibition fund the great exhibition was the brainchild of 
prince albert queen victorias husband and made a considerable 
profit from the crowds who came to see wonders such as the crystal 
palace

utah has the healthiest population of the 50 
states and delaware the sickest according to a nationwide study 
that seems to show higher elevations and northern lattitudes are 
better for the body 
the compilation of statistics from public and private health 
groups showed people who live in most rocky mountain and upper 
midwest states are healthier than residents of the southeast and 
the east coast 
utah residents live an average of 2 years longer than residents 
of delaware according to the study by the northwestern national 
life insurance co 
many of the states that show up at the bottom of the list 
arent the ones most people would expect florida for example has 
one of the highest life expectancies but poor health habits bring 
it down to 44th place said frederic sattler head of the 
insurors health care division 
michigan in spite of its high median income ranked 48th due 
to the highest level of disease in america he said 
the study released this week compiled data from the 1986 
national health survey along with information from the american 
cancer society the american heart association the national center 
for health statistics and the american medical association 
the states were compared in terms of life expectancy incidence 
of major illnesses lifestyle habits such as tobacco and alcohol 
consumption access to medical care absence from work due to 
illness and mortality rates 
after utah the healthiest states were north dakota idaho 
minnesota and hawaii the bottom five were south carolina nevada 
michigan mississippi and delaware 
youll probably find a pretty good correlation between health 
and genetics education a clean environment and even the cultural 
background sattler said 
theres less of a relation between health and income he 
said adding that montana with a median income below the national 
average ranked as one of the 10 healthiest states 
among the studys findings 
hawaii has the highest life expectancy followed by minnesota 
iowa utah and north dakota 
utah has the lowest incidence of major illness followed by 
idaho wyoming north dakota and minnesota 
utah where the dominant mormon religion forbids use of many 
stimulants had the best ranking in terms of lifestyle habits such 
as exercise and low smoking and drinking next in line were idaho 
iowa and nebraska and kansas 
hawaii and utah tied for the lowest mortality rate followed by

former president ronald reagan winding up a 
nineday visit to japan said today that americans do not feel 
their products have fair access to japanese markets and called for 
a pacific free trade zone 
addressing 400 prominent businessmen in the western port of 
osaka reagan said japan and the united states should put this 
stepbystep bickering behind us and embrace a trade vision that is 
encompassing 
we are the two greatest economic powers in the world reagan 
said let us leap beyond our nowin squabbling by undertaking a 
breathtaking plan a free trade zone between the us and japan 
in earlier appearances during his current visit reagan glossed 
over trade disputes to emphasize positive aspects of bilateral 
ties today he took direct aim at japanese policy 
americans admire japan he said but sixtyeight percent of 
americans find the economic threat from japan to be a more serious 
threatthan the military threat from the soviet union 
the notion is wrong but americans believe us products do 
not get fair access in japan he said 
japan enjoyed a 52 billion trade surplus with the united states 
last year according to us figures 
reagan said the principle of fairness had been a very strong 
strain among americans referring to the unfair treatment from 
britain that provoked the boston tea party in 1773 we dont want 
a japanese tea party he said 
in another criticism of tokyos policies the former president 
warned japan faced possible boycotts of its products over practices 
of driftnet fishing and logging in tropical rain forests 
reagan and his wife nancy who arrived in japan oct 20 left 
for the united states today aboard a boeing 747 chartered by their 
hosts the fujisankei communications group japans largest media 
conglomerate 
they shared the jet with 230 family members of us military 
personnel stationed in japan who hitched a free ride with them to 
the orient 
the reagans in japan at the invitation of the government and 
fujisankei have not commented on reports reagan will receive about 
2 million for his appearances on television and at charitable 
events during his visit 
fujisankei reportedly spent 7 million on the entire visit 
which has been seen as an opportunity to improve japans ties with 
the united states

seattle ap a crowd of hundreds watched as radical vietnam 
veterans torched 1000 american flags in a festival of defiance 
early today minutes after a federal law prohibiting desecration of 
the flag went into effect 
alternately chanting burn baby burn and singing the 
national anthem the crowd cheered as members of vietnam veterans 
against the warantiimperialist torched a pile of american flags 
shortly after midnight 
on friday four cloth flags were burned in a protest at 
berkeley calif and a flag burning at colorado state university 
was halted when a passerby snuffed the flames with his bare hands 
kathleen taylor american civil liberties union director in 
seattle said the law encourages the very action its intended to 
discourage 
there were no incidents of public flag burning in seattle 
until congress enacted the prohibition she said liberty needs 
special protection not its symbol the flag 
the law took effect at 1201 am 
one thousand flags one large and most of the rest the size of 
a large postage stamp were burned in the seattle protest 
organizers said 
the demonstration was held in front of a post office and the 
flag hanging on a pole outside the building was lowered doused 
with lighter fluid and set afire 
were burning the flag to say we will not stand by to see 
forced patriotism abridgement of the first amendment right of 
free speech is the first infringement said brian chambers who 
served in vietnam in 197071 
no voices were raised in opposition to torching the flags 
flagburnings were conducted in other cities friday 
in berkeley members of the emergency committee to stop the flag 
amendment and laws burned cloth flags and handed out small paper 
flags mounted on toothpicks and asked bystanders to set them ablaze 
as we all know the flag is just a symbol a piece of cloth 
even the rightwing supreme court upheld that position attorney 
linda fullerton vice president of the bay area chapter of the 
national lawyers guild said at the demonstration fullerton did 
not burn any flags at the protest 
in fort collins colo jeff crank nearly got his hands singed 
when he broke up a protest at colorado state by rubbing out the 
flames of a burning flag with his bare hands 
my father served in world war ii crank shouted after 
grabbing the flag im not going to let what he did go by the 
wayside so that you can burn this flag 
jamie krutz a freelance writer who organized the protest said 
he was pleased with the impromptu debate that the partial 
flagburning had generated 
we werent eager to burn a flag in the first place he said 
we have a high respect for the flag we have a higher respect for 
freedom 
burning one flag is punishable by a 1000 fine and up to a year 
in jail 
the new law was passed by both houses of congress earlier this 
month in response to a supreme court ruling that struck down a 
texas law making it illegal to burn the us flag 
the law is subject to judicial review opponents and supporters 
have said that if the court overturns the law there will be new 
pressure to amend the constitution to allow congress and the states 
to ban flag desecration

they will still use no 2 pencils to fill 
in the oval blanks but the act tests administered today to 
aspiring college students have undergone their first overhaul since 
the american college testing program began in 1959 
there is more of an emphasis than ever on the ability of a 
student to think and apply and problemsolve with the new test 
rather than just to recall some fact or piece of information act 
president richard ferguson said friday 
ferguson said well over 300000 students are registered to 
take the enhanced act assessment test nationwide today most 
colleges in 28 us states weigh the act test results in their 
application procedures 
the new act test includes 215 questions and takes 2 hours and 55 
minutes to complete the old test had 219 questions and took 2 
hours and 40 minutes 
work on the new exam began seven or eight years ago and act 
officials have studied surveyed and tested it over the last three 
or four years ferguson said 
there wont be surprises for us he said we know how it 
will work 
the new test will give more detailed information on students to 
high schools and colleges ferguson said 
the english section includes questions that measure a students 
awareness of decisions a person makes when writing including style 
and audience 
the range of questions has increased in the math section to 
include easier and more difficult questions and has been lengthened 
by 10 questions and 10 minutes 
the new reading section includes fiction and readings in the 
humanities 
the knowledgeoffacts items have been dropped from the science 
reasoning section which now focuses on the process of science the 
section still includes material from science areas covered in high 
school 
the enhanced test also includes subscores in english math and 
reading which the old test did not compile 
act officials expect higher scores but say it is not easier 
on the average the test will not be more difficult than it 
was before we are simply testing some different things ferguson 
said 
overall scoring has changed so that a 15 composite score last 
year might be comparable to an 18 composite this year officials 
said the range is from 1 to 36

they feel quite as confident about this one said bryan whose 
union representing mechanics ramp agents and baggage handlers 
walked out march 4 and was joined by the pilots and flight 
attendants unions at eastern 
under the bill a democrat and republican from each house of 
congress would be appointed by their respective leaders and over 45 
days would investigate the eastern situation they would make 
recommendations on how to resolve the strike and also on how to 
preserve competitiveness in the airline industry and how to protect 
employees rights during bankruptcy protection 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days 
after the strike began 
the union struck after federal mediation failed to resolve their 
contract dispute president bush was empowered to intervene then 
but refused 
the dispute is over proposed wage cuts and workrule changes 
but the unions charge that texas air which bought eastern in 1986 
planned all along to break easterns unions while siphoning off its 
assets to the parent company 
eastern on wednesday will increase its daily flights to 775 and 
is aiming to fly 1000 daily flights by midspring eastern had 
nearly 1100 daily flights when the strike began

the new york stock exchange said it would 
contact wall street brokerages about reforming computerized program 
trading rules after three major firms dropped the strategy 
morgan stanley group inc and bear stearns amp co two of the 
biggest users of program trading said friday they would stop using 
a form of the strategy known as index arbitrage to trade for their 
own accounts painewebber group inc also stopped using the 
strategy 
phoenix mutual life insurance co of hartford conn which 
manages more than 86 billion in assets stopped doing business 
with brokerages that conduct program trading becoming the third 
large institution to do so this week 
certainly as a marketplace that has almost 47 million 
individual investors we have got to be concerned about anything 
that might be harmful to those constituent users nyse president 
richard grasso said 
goldman sachs amp co asked the nyse to place new limits on index 
arbitrage while dean witter reynolds inc which abandoned the 
strategy earlier this year sent a sharply critical letter to more 
than 2 million clients 
the outcry follows a return of volatile market price swings in 
recent weeks including the 190point drop in the dow jones 
industrial average on oct 13 and an 85point morning drop this 
past monday 
earlier this week kemper financial services inc and keystone 
group inc two major institutional investors said they would no 
longer buy or sell stock through brokerages that conduct index 
arbitrage phoenix mutual followed suit friday 
index arbitrage is a computerized trading strategy aimed at 
profiting on brief and minute differences between prices of stocks 
and stockindex futures which are traded on chicago futures 
exchanges 
the trading tactic in which millions of shares can be bought or 
sold in seconds often is geared to make shortterm gains in 
excitable markets

agents marlborough fine art in albemarle street off piccadilly 
but he did show up friday morning 
he looked very well hes still painting of course said a 
member of the staff 
bacon paints disquieting and disturbing pictures of people dogs 
and carcasses in rooms that look like torture chambers his work 
portrays the world in anguish 
one of his favorite images is the 17th century pope innocent x 
in a famous portrait by diego velazquez bacon took over the 
velazquez and on several canvases depicted the pope caged in plate

colombias former justice minister said the entire 
international community must help her nation battle its drug 
barons and could start by helping to pay for reforms of the 
colombian justice system 
monica de greiff 32 served only 70 days as her nations top 
law enforcement official before resigning last month amid threats 
from traffickers and fleeing with her family to the united states 
dozens of plainclothes us marshals and miami police officers 
stood guard friday as she addressed the colombian american chamber 
of commerce of greater miami her first public speech since leaving 
office 
i am not in favor of a dialogue with drug traffickers and i 
upheld that policy in the time i served as a minister ms de 
greiff said and i believe that continues to be the policy 
instead she said the international community must cease feuding 
over whether the drug problem is one of producing or consuming 
nations and form a united front against drugs 
our societies have been challenged by this invisible enemy a 
common enemy said ms de geiff there is no historical 
precedent for this kind of war 
neither the opium wars in china during the last century nor the 
us experiment with prohibition in the 1920s created problems of 
the current magnitude she said 
colombia cannot continue to fight alone with the united states 
as its only partner said ms de greiff 
she said one concrete step would be for the international 
financial community to smooth the way for a 40 million loan to 
modernize and protect colombias beleaguered judicial branch 
ms de greiff resigned at the height of drugrelated violence 
sparked by the aug 18 assassination of leading presidential 
candidate sen luis carlos galan 
her resignation was widely attributed to repeated death threats 
but she has said she quit because president virgilio barco wanted 
to replace her 
since leaving office ms de greiff has been living in the us 
with her husband argentine public relations consultant miguel 
paley and their 3yearold son she said she has not been 
threatened in the us and plans to stay in this country for the 
present

usbacked rebels have blocked a key 
highway for seven days cutting flour and fuel shipments to the 
capital government soldiers said today 
soldiers said heavy fighting had broken out on the salang 
highway just north of kabul on the southern slope of the massive 
hindu kush mountains for the past three nights government forces 
have launched dozens of sovietmade katyusha rockets at the highway 
from bases in kabul 
in pakistan the private news agency afghan press reported that 
government planes had bombed a 40mile stretch of the highway to 
push through un supplies headed for kabul the rebel alliances 
official news organ said however it could not confirm the attacks 
the government troops said more than 1500 trucks carrying food 
and weapons were backed up on the highway they said shipments of 
fuel and food from harytan on the soviet border had stopped and 
more than 18000 metric tons of gasoline and oil are waiting at the 
border town for shipment 
a un official said some of the supplies on the salang road 
were from a un shipment of finnish aid which entered afghanistan 
last week but he said it took up only several trucks most of the 
aid is going to poor families in northern afghanistan 
in the capital government forces have been launching scores of 
rockets north in the direction of the highway on friday night the 
sky was streaked red with flames from the rocket boosters as they 
sped north seconds later the sky would be bright orange with 
explosions lighting up the black hills 
government and private markets have been without flour the main 
grain of afghanistan since midweek the city however is not in 
immediate danger silos holding 50000 metric tons of grain are 
reportedly full 
the salang road is the only land route through which a 
substantial amount of commodities have passed recently the road 
east to jalalabad is open one day closed the next said one 
soldier the road south to logram is effectively closed to 
government traffic as is the road west to herat 
hundreds of antonov12 supply planes from the soviet union have 
arrived at kabuls international airport over the past few days 
but each plane can only carry about 30 tons each 
gasoline prices are skyrocketing in the city going as high as 
6500 afghanis 1325 a gallon when asked where the flour is 
merchants at food markets put ther fingers to their lips and blow 
imaginary dust from their nails 
its gone with the wind said one trader sitting on a bag 
of rice in his converted ship container which he uses as a store 
it could not be immediately determined which rebel group was 
carrying out the attacks on the salang road which primarily is the 
domain of mujahedeen commander ahmad shah masoud of the powerful 
jamiatiislami rebel group 
masoud has pledged not to attack nonmilitary traffic but the 
rival hezbiislami group of fundamentalist gulbaddin hekmatyar has 
said it wants to cut all supplies to kabul forcing people to flee 
hezb guerrillas operate to a limited extent along the lower salang 
close to the capital 
the fighting appeared to be part of a recent increase in rebel 
assaults against the government 
fighting over the southeastern town of khost has intensified 
over the last month with reports of rebel gains the guerrillas got 
so close to the city in late september that the government was 
forced to kill its own troops with sovietmade scud missiles when 
it wiped out rebel positions a diplomat said 
the diplomat who comes from a socialist country with good 
relations with afghanistan cited a government military source for 
the information 
observers in kabul said the current military activity appeared 
to indicate the rebels were returning to the hitandrun startegy 
they used during the decadelong soviet military intervention 
rebel attempts to adopt conventional military tactics and take 
the eastern city of jalalabad earlier this year failed

attempted murder of seven people racketeering witness 
intimidation kidnapping and obstruction of justice us attorney 
anton r valukas said at a news conference friday

the el rukns also were charged with controlling a major part of 
chicagos drug market over the last 24 years the indictment also 
charged five robinson associates with fraud racketeering and 
conspiracy 
we intend to bring an end to this scourge that has 
debilitated the city of chicago and suburbs throughout these 
years valukas said i expect if the prosecutions are 
effective yes it will be a death blow to the el rukn gang 
the arrest of the gang members could help solve up to 50 
unsolved slayings dating to the late 1960s said dot koester 
spokeswoman for the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms in 
washington 
robinson 45 was arrested at his south side home friday 
valukas said if convicted he could be sentenced to 249 years in 
prison 
robinson and jackson a democratic candidate for president in 
1984 and 1988 have the same father but jackson has described 
their relationship as strained 
robinsons associates face an average of 160 years in prison if 
convicted the indictment charged that robinson sold heroin and 
cocaine to a drug operation that controlled hundreds of markets in 
chicago and milwaukee and had ties in new york south carolina

in milwaukee minneapolis south carolina ohio and new york

chicago police seized the el rukns south side headquarters in a 
morning raid friday police superintendent leroy martin said the

abortion opponents say they will have 
to wait until spring to have abortion restrictions considered again 
by the general assembly 
ralph rivera chairman of the illinois prolife coalition said 
oppoents of legalized abortion have decided not to push the 
legislation any more this year because the bill is one vote short 
of getting through the house rules committee 
we really dont want a media event on this he said friday 
the decision likely postpones any action on abortion legislation 
in illinois until the spring session 
the proposal drafted to mirror missouri abortion restrictions 
upheld by the supreme court would have required doctors to 
determine the viability of any fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or 
older before performing an abortion 
it also required the presence of a second physician at the 
abortion of any fetus determined to be viable and barred public 
employees and public facilities from involvement in the procedures

a biblequoting judge sentenced john david 
brown to life in prison with no parole for murdering a church 
caretaker 
brown who had eluded hundreds of police officers in the longest 
manhunt in missouri history showed no emotion as judge douglas 
long pronounced the sentence friday 
a jury convicted brown on july 29 of murdering claude c long 
inside a church in nearby doolittle in central missouri on april 1 
1987 
two different individuals were taking refuge in that church 
for different reasons the judge said adding a quote from the 
book of amos in the bible as if a man were to flee from a lion 
and be met by a bear 
do you understand that long asked 
after appearing bewildered for a moment brown slowly nodded his 
head and said yes sir 
the victim a retired soldier was preparing the church for 
evening services when he was shot 
the judge no relation to the victim said the case lacked the 
necessary aggravating circumstances to warrant the death penalty 
county prosecutor john wiggins said he was not disappointed with 
the life sentence 
our primary objective was conviction through a fair trial and 
thats what mr brown received he said 
about 45 spectators attended the sentencing including browns 
father grandmother and sister they did not act surprised by the 
verdict 
i figured theyd do this said browns grandmother lula 
brooks 82 but i still dont think they truthfully proved he 
killed that man 
browns courtappointed attorney brad kessler made an 
impassioned plea to jurors to spare browns life for the sake of 
his sickly father and elderly grandmother 
he praised the judges decision 
i think he did a lot of soul searching and i think that he did 
what was right for him kessler said i think the punishment 
fits the crime 
but kessler said he would file an appeal within 10 days 
brown had frustrated police for weeks by hiding out in the ozark 
mountains after the killing inspiring songs and stories in nearby 
towns 
he was captured on may 28 1987 by fbi agents in ada okla a 
357caliber magnum revolver found on brown was identified by 
several ballistics experts as the gun used to kill long 
long 56 a military retiree from waynesville was preparing the 
new apostolic church west of rolla when he was shot once in the 
head the prosecution contended that brown shot long and then stole 
the victims car 
at the time police were hunting brown for allegedly wounding a 
rolla police officer two days earlier in a motel parking lot 
brown had been at large since escaping in 1984 from the ozark 
correctional center where he was serving time for burglary and 
possession of explosive weapons

a salvage expert who discovered two 19th century 
steamers at the bottom of lake michigan is battling the state for 
control of the wrecks 
harry zych searched the cold waters of the lake for nearly 16 
years to find the seabird and the lady elgin a luxury steamer 
whose 287 passengers and their valuables sank when the boat was 
accidentally rammed by another vessel in 1860 
all i want to do is see this wreck preserved zych said 
friday referrring to the lady elgin 
in august the 41yearold diver and salvage company operator 
filed a claim in us district court in chicago seeking title to 
the two ships under federal admiralty law 
diving in 42degree water he already has removed some artifacts 
from the wrecks and says more should be brought to the surface for 
preservation the recovered items are under control of the court 
until ownership is decided 
illinois officials claim the wrecks are state property and 
should stay at the bottom untouched except for authorized 
archeological work and recreational sightseeing by divers 
to go in and strip them of artifacts and sell them is just not 
palatable to the state and is not in the best interest of the 
state said william kane an assistant state attorney general 
kanes office is seeking to intervene in the case on behalf of 
the illinois department of transportation and the illinois historic 
agency 
a 1987 federal law gives states the rights to any shipwrecks 
found in their territorial waters kane said the state is also 
citing an illinois law that prohibits the desecration of 
unregistered graves 
although zych wont reveal the specific location of the wrecks 
he doesnt dispute that the wrecks lie in illinois waters and his 
legal action in federal court in chicago indicates they are 
the sinking of the lady elgin sept 8 1860 somewhere off 
chicagos north shore suburbs ranks as one of the worst disasters 
in the history of great lakes shipping the death toll is listed as 
287 most of the victims were members of a milwaukee political 
group returning from an excursion to chicago 
the wooden sidewheeled steamer was rammed by the lumber 
schooner augusta which was running without lights the lady elgin 
sank rapidly and only a handful of passengers made it to shore in 
winnetka 
in a lesserknown tragedy the seabird caught fire and sank 
april 9 1868 killing all but one of the 100 passengers on board 
also a sidewheeled steamer the seabird was making its first run 
of the season to chicago after wintering in manitowoc wis 
zych said he has found no remains on either wreck and cited 
newspaper and other historical accounts that all the bodies were 
recovered soon after the sinkings 
zych who runs the american diving and salvage co said he 
first started looking for the lady elgin in 1973 and found it in 
may using sonar

the governments tough austerity program is 
putting people out of work and unemployment will double to 4 
percent by the end of the year a newspaper quoted officials as 
saying today 
song xiaowu of the china enterprise management association told 
an international business forum that millions of people in rural 
areas not included in chinese employment figures also will be 
without work 
the sword of damocles hanging over the capitalist society is 
now hanging over the heads of the workers of new china the 
official china daily quoted song as saying 
he said unemployment among chinas urban workforce of 135 
million stood at 2 percent in february but has increased sharply 
since the government suspended construction projects and took other 
measures to curb overheated economic growth 
the unemployment problem has come to the forefront of our 
whole society song was quoted as saying how to correctly 
identify and effectively solve the problem poses a new challenge to 
the theory and practice of chinas economic development and 
structural reforms 
chinese officials have acknowledged the austerity program will 
put people out of work previously however they stressed that 
most people losing jobs are rural transients who will return to 
work on their farms 
song said however that there are 80 million surplus farmers 
township enterprises that have provided jobs for many will absorb 
50 percent fewer workers this year than last 
song said chinas unemployment problems are exacerbated by 20 
million surplus workers in stateowned enterprises who cant be 
laid off because of the governments policy of providing jobs for 
all 
beijing has made an attempt to cope with the unemployment 
situation by encouraging outofwork people to set up collective 
and private businesses and exempting them from income tax for one 
year and business tax for half a year 
however they were unlikely to get many takers under the current 
political and economic atmosphere private entrepreneurs are being 
strongly criticized as exploiters and the government has cut 
off credit to smaller businesses 
meanwhile the nation as a whole is doing little about the 
unemployment problem a few cities have experimented with providing 
unemployment insurance but for the most part people without work 
receive no benefits and get little help finding work

a former uss iowa gunnery officer who 
permitted sailors to conduct unauthorized experiments with the 
battleships 16inch guns has been given a letter of reprimand 
navy officials announced 
the punishment was imposed friday on lt cmdr kenneth m 
costigan sr at an administrative hearing stemming from the 
explosion in a gun turret on the battleship that killed 47 sailors 
april 19 
costigan who was relieved of command of the iowas big guns 
earlier this year also received a suspended fine of 1500 which 
will be negated in six months if he does not violate goodbehavior 
rules the navy said 
costigan has been reassigned to a position in a shore command in 
norfolk navy sources told the daily press of newport news 
costigan is the fifth and final iowa sailor to be reprimanded 
for administrative deficiencies uncovered in an investigation 
of the blast the navy has emphasized that those deficiencies did 
not contribute to the deaths in turret no 2 of the battleship 
navy officials have said that while they may never know the 
exact cause of the explosion the preponderance of evidence 
points to an act of sabotage by clayton m hartwig a 24yearold 
gunners mate from cleveland who was killed in the blast 
under the direction of one of costigans subordinates the crew 
of turret no 2 prepared to fire a 2700pound projectile with the 
wrong kind of powder the day of the explosions costigan has said 
he believed the crew was engaging in authorized ordnance 
experiments

an envoy of president bush will meet 
with officials in vietnam next week to discuss missing american 
soldiers and other humanitarian issues 
presidential envoy john w vessey jr a retired general is to 
arrive sunday for a twoday visit the first by an american 
official since vietnam said it had withdrawn its troops in cambodia 
last month 
vessey is to hold talks on humanitarian issues including efforts 
to account for an estimated 1700 american soldiers missing from 
the war in vietnam a us embassy spokesman in bangkok said today 
vesseys visit in august 1987 resulted in agreements to speed up 
work on humanitarian issues including the resettlement of 
vietnamese migrants and refugees in the united states he was the 
highestranking us official to visit since the communists 
defeated the usbacked south vietnam government in april 1975 
this current mission seeks to expand and improve on the 
significant progress attained over the past two years said the 
embassy spokesman james williams 
he said vesseys team included senior state and defense 
department officials and ann mills griffiths the head of the 
private national league of families of american prisioners and 
missing in southeast asia 
the visit comes as us and vietnamese specialists were halfway 
into their 8th joint field investigations to account for missing 
soldiers one team was investigating an area in song be province in 
southern vietnam while the other team was working in ha bac 
province in the northern region 
the vietnamese seek american diplomatic recognition to end their 
isolation from the noncommunist world and bring in badly needed 
economic assistance they have complained about us refusal to 
move in that direction after vietnam in late september withdrew 
what it called its last 26000 troops from cambodia an action 
washington had called a prerequisite for establishing relations 
but washington now demands that vietnam work toward getting a 
political settlement to the war between westernbacked guerrillas 
and the vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh 
in the current situation we plan to steadfastly maintain our 
support for the diplomatic and economic isolation of vietnam 
us deputy assistant secretary of state david f lambertson said 
earlier this month 
on friday the official voice of vietnam radio said there have 
been new developments in relations with the united states in 
recent months and noted the visit by vessey and previous visits by 
prominent americans 
it noted that vietnam earlier this month returned three sets of 
remains believed to be those of missing americans since march 1974 
vietnam has repatriated 394 sets of remains on 29 occasions it 
said

israel uses violence and torture to oppress 
palestinians a former norwegian ambassador to tel aviv said in an 
interview published today 
torleiv anda 68 retired from diplomatic service last summer 
after having served in israel since 1984 
little by little i had to turn completely around in my 
conceptions about israel and its form of democracy the oslo 
newspaper aftenposten quoted anda as saying in an interview 
aftenposten said anda would publish a book in two weeks time 
entitled intefadeh revolt against israel in which he 
criticizes israeli policy and occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
if i was asked about my main reason for having lost so much 
belief in israeli democracy anda said i would have to say it 
is the question of punishment forms and the judicial system the 
incomprehensible and unappreciative corruption in the 
administration of justice has discredited itself far beyond 
israels borders 
anda also said his attitude to the plo has changed 
when i came to israel i had a quite banal and vulgar 
conception of the palestine liberation organization as being a 
terrorist organization but gradually i discovered that plo 
consists of a lot of clever and very honest people 
he said there is no other alternative to the plo in the occupied 
territories and that the group must be dealt with in any peace 
negotiations israel refuses to negotiate with the plo because it 
considers the group a terrorist organization 
since taking over power two weeks ago norways new 
nonsocialist government of jan p syse has signaled it would place 
more critical demands on the plo and give stronger emphasis to 
israels right to secure and recognized borders 
foreign minister kjell magne bondevik last week refused to meet 
with plo representatives attending the annual convention of 
landsorganisasjonen the confederation of norwegian trade unions

hundreds of demonstrators from both sides 
of the irish border rode peace trains between belfast and 
dublin today to protest the continuing ira bombing of the 
crossborder rail link 
when the two trains pulled into dublins connolly station they 
were greeted by irelands post office workers union band playing 
congratulations the first train arrived 28 minutes late 
because of mechanical 
the only sign of opposition was at the newry station in county 
down near the border where followers of sinn fein the irish 
republican armys legal political wing carried banners calling for 
british withdrawal from northern ireland 
the almost exclusively roman catholic ira is fighting to push 
the british out of protestantdominated northern ireland join it 
with the republic of ireland and set up an allireland socialist 
state 
rail passengers planned to distribute leaflets in dublin 
demanding an end to the bombings of the rail line they were then 
to make the 100mile return trip to belfast where a similar protest 
was scheduled 
one of the irish politicians on the train workers party leader 
proinsias de rossa called for the organizing committee to remain 
in existence and become a broadly based campaign for peace in 
ireland 
he said the unprecedented response to the idea with well over 
1000 people looking for places on the trains at one stage 
showed there was a huge number of people in the north and south 
anxious to take a public stand for peace and against terrorism 
the peace train concept has brought together people of 
different political opinions from all walks of life north and 
south i am sure the vast majority would also be prepared to 
support a more general demand for peace and an end to the killing 
and destruction he said 
train service between the two cities has been disrupted more 
than 60 times this year because of bombs and bomb hoaxes causing a 
sharp drop in the number of passengers and threatening the future 
of the line organizers said 
people right across the community are making a point and the 
point is this that this railway link between north and south must 
be kept open it is vital to our island said bishop samuel ponyz 
of the protestant church of ireland who saw the demonstrators off 
in belfast 
bishop cahal daly a roman catholic leader in northern ireland 
who joined him at belfast station added this is a message the 
ira cannot refuse to hear because it is coming from working and 
middle class people young and old who are not going to allow 
communication in this island to be stopped 
dr chris mcgimpsey secretary of the organizers and a member of 
the east belfast unionist association said hundreds of people had 
to be turned away because the trains were full seats were free but 
tickets were needed 
all we are doing is making a peaceful point he said we 
just want the ira to stop blowing up the line

former prime minister zenko suzuki will not run for 
reelection to parliament an aide said today making him the third 
expremier planning to clear the way for younger leaders in the 
troubled governing party 
suzuki prime minister for the liberal democratic party between 
1980 and 1982 said he would retire from politics when his term 
expires next summer said kazuhiko hiraga a spokesman for suzukis 
election committee in morioka in northern japan 
suzuki 78 will make an official announcement at a news 
conference after the election committees regular meeting sunday 
hiraga told the associated press 
to us mr suzukis decision came out of the blue hiraga 
said 
earlier this year kakuei tanaka 71 and takeo fukuda 84 said 
they also will not run again and will leave their seats in the 
powerful lower house of parliament next summer 
suzuki told the nhk broadcasting network he believes the two 
decided to resign as a younger generation of politicians has 
become active and its time for senior people to retire 
i strongly feel a big wave of change coming with the new 
generation said suzuki whose party has been dogged by a series 
of sex and influencepeddling scandals for more than a year 
fukuda told kyodo news service he was surprised by suzukis 
decision and said he hoped suzuki would remain active in politics 
even though he would not be in office 
hiraga said reactions from suzukis local election committee 
were varied some say its disappointing to see mr suzuki leave 
while others say its about time 
the cabinet of prime minister toshiki kaifu japans third 
premier this year was only a few months ago considered a 
transitional government to smooth over the rocky political fortunes 
of the liberal democrats 
recent opinion polls show kaifu who at 58 is considerably more 
youthful than most party leaders gaining in popularity among 
voters partially due to his planned revisions of an unpopular 3 
percent sales tax 
suzuki became prime minister in july 1980 after the sudden 
death of prime minister masayohi ohira he resigned in november 
1982 after a series of unpopular political moves including a 
decision to freeze a pay raise for the countrys 500000 public 
servants 
fukuda left office in 1978 and tanaka in 1974 tanakas exit was 
prompted though not forced by a lockheed payoff scandal while 
fukuda was suffering a drop in popularity due to economic recession

organizers say threats of an 
attack by white extremists will not stop sundays rally for freed 
leaders of the outlawed african national congress 
the rally will go ahead despite threats from the faceless 
rightwingers said cyril ramaphosa a union leader who is one of 
the main organizers we appeal to our people to conduct 
themselves in a highly disciplined fashion to avoid any form of 
provocation 
elsewhere saturday several hundred blacks staged an 
antigovernment march in pretoria and about 30 black and mixedrace 
teachers and students read for two hours in a whitesonly 
public library in boksburg east of johannesburg 
but two planned protest marches in other towns failed to 
materialize after magistrates banned them and police cordoned off 
assembly points 
police officials have confirmed they were aware of anonymous 
threats by rightwing whites to shoot at blacks during the rally 
sunday in hopes of provoking a bloodbath the officials said steps 
would be taken to prevent any attack 
organizers hope to draw at least 80000 people to the rally at a 
soccer stadium between johannesburg and soweto for what could be 
the largest antigovernment gathering ever in south africa 
there are plans to use about 300 buses to bring supporters of 
the outlawed african national congress to the rally from 
communities across the country 
organizers said no spectators will be allowed on the playing 
field of the stadium seven hundred security marshals recruited 
from antiapartheid organizations are to screen people as they pass 
through entrance gates to the stands 
seven of the eight men to be honored were freed unconditionally 
on oct 15 and the other was released in november 1987 six were 
sentenced to life imprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along with 
nelson mandela the african national congress bestknown leader 
who remains jailed 
the keynote speech expected to outline the main components of 
current african national congress policy is to be given by walter 
sisulu he is a close colleague of mandelas and was the congress 
general secretary when arrested in 1963 
the organization has been outlawed since 1960 a year before it 
began a sabotage and bombing campaign against the white minority 
government 
it is illegal in south africa to promote the aims of the 
organization but government officials have indicated that police 
will not interfere with the rally unless disturbances occur 
since midseptember the government has allowed numerous protest 
marches nationwide organized by trade unions and other 
antiapartheid groups 
however a magistrate banned a protest march which black trade 
unions had planned for saturday in vereeniging an industrial city 
south of johannesburg small groups of workers assembled at various 
points in the city and there were unconfirmed reports that eight 
were arrested but the march did not materialize

a killer whale appears to have flipped 
for a norwegian ferry enchanting passengers and most of norway as 
it tries to court the lumbering vessel 
for 10 days the 13footlong killer whale has hugged the side 
of the voksa a 150foot car and passenger ferry on its 
glamourless route to island villages that freckle the west coast of 
norway 
norwegian newspapers widely reported the blackandwhite sea 
mammals infatuation with the blackandwhite ferry 
although the whale has been making all the advances a voksa 
crewman said its hard to say who fell in love with whom 
the crew claims the whale enjoys showing off for people they 
named it hanna despite questions of its gender 
kjell nystoeyl the voksas 35yearold captain said hanna 
probably lost her flock seen in the area about a month ago 
there must be some vibration from the ships hull that she 
finds comforting he said 
sea mammal expert karl inne ugland of the university of oslo 
said the whale is lonely and wants company because it has a strong 
flock instinct he said it is probably a young female about 7 
years old 
killer whales actually large dolphins are intelligent and 
hanna knows she is being watched by people aboard the ferry ugland 
said 
in port the whale gently bumps and rubs herself against the 
voksas cold steel hull she rolls over lazily to allow streams of 
water pumped from the ships side to shower her white belly 
hanna lolls in the bubbly backwash of the ships propellers 
waiting up to half an hour for it to load passengers and cars the 
whale peers up at downturned faces showing her teeth which causes 
many passengers to smile back 
the unlikely pair has drawn crowds at each of the four stops on 
the ferrys 12milelong route in the beautiful and remote fiord 
south of the town of aalesund 
shes really putting on a show for you today crewman 
bjoernar hal kjellsvik told a reporter 
passengers endured icy wind to spend hours leaning over the 
ships side watching the antics some drove eight or nine hours on 
treacherous mountain roads to see hanna teachers suspended classes 
so schoolchildren could ride the ferry 
shes like the ferrys guardian angel when she is around 
nothing bad could happen to the voksa said passenger gerd 
ristesund 
the whale dives deep under the white foam of voksas wake as it 
clips along at 14 mph then erupts inches from the boat splashing 
delighted passengers she has logged about 745 miles a week at 
voksas side nystoeyl said 
the killer whale and the boat had to adjust to each other at 
first hanna was wary of shallow harbors and disrupted the voksas 
timetable 
the first few days we were delayed because we were afraid to 
hit her and because so many people came to see her said nystoeyl 
the worst thing about the whale is getting people to pay for 
their tickets said kjellsvik 
i have to shout at people to get their attention because they 
are all leaning over the railing to watch her said kjellsvik 
hanna snubs handouts she has refused fish offered by the crew 
and is believed to hunt while the ship is docked at night 
during a break the voksa captain tried to give the whale a 
backrub with a stiff broom the whale kept its distance but 
nystoeyl said shell get used to it 
the crew worries that hanna might grow bored with the ferry and 
jilt the boat for a flock of real killer whales 
the first question every crewman asks when they come aboard is 
have you seen her today said machinist olav vestnes 
mammal expert ugland said the whale will probably leave the 
fiord this winter if shes still there in april shell probably 
stick with the boat for a long time he said

czechs striving for democracy may 
look to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev as a force for change 
but in the twisting alleys and elegant squares of old prague the 
name masaryk still rings clear 
tomas garrigue masaryk philosopher dreamer politician orator 
and liberator of czechoslovakia in 1918 symbolizes czech 
yearnings for democracy he was instrumental in forming the 
republic in 1918 it existed for 20 years as an independent country 
until the munich pact opened the way for hitler to take over 
his son jan masaryk was the radio voice of czechoslovakia from 
london during the dark days of nazi rule he had become the 
czechoslovak foreign minister when the communists seized power in 
1948 and died a few days after the takeover in a mysterious fall 
from the window of his apartment in the foreign ministry 
the names of the father who died in 1937 and the son have a 
mystical pull on czechoslovaks the masaryks decades after their 
deaths also are a problem for the communists 
in the lies and halftruths that surround us it is 
necessary to recall tomas garrigue masaryk who as a politician 
embodied an unambiguously moral standpoint an unofficial youth 
group the independent peace association noted recently in a 
typical show of popular respect 
during maxaryks presidency from 1918 to 1935 the youths 
declared czechoslovak society was free to use democratic 
institutions as never before and never since 
despite decades of communist schooling that paid little or no 
heed to the masaryks most czechs revere masaryk as a leader of 
impeccable morals education and eloquence 
by contrast they laughed in ridicule recently listening to 
blackmarket tapes of current communist leader milos jakes speaking 
incoherently to fellow comrades 
in the heady prague spring of 1968 the masaryks were 
honored as a source of inspiration for the democratic reforms then 
sweeping the country 
demanding an investigation into jans mysterious death 
thousands of students made pilgrimages to lany a village 30 miles 
west of prague and the family graves 
masaryk maintained a country residence in lany that is now 
occupied by president gustav husak in the village cemetery 
masaryk his american wife charlotte and jan lie buried beneath a 
simple slab of polished granite 
during the prague spring there was a revival of official 
interest in masaryk and minor officials paid tribute at the lany 
grave 
with reform again in the air 20 years later lowranking 
officials have returned to the lany cemetery 
in hurried ceremonies last year and this they laid wreaths on 
masaryks to mark the oct 28 anniversary of the proclamation of 
the republic and again designated the day a public holiday 
the low rank of the officials and the brevity of the ceremonies 
testified to the communists continuing unease about masaryk 
aware of the standing of taticek or daddy as masaryk 
is popularly known the government is beginning to accord him a 
role in the official version of national history 
masaryk was undoubtedly the most important politician we ever 
had said josef harma a leading official historian today we 
are trying to rectify the deformed picture put in the minds of our 
people in the 1950s or later than that 
but he added swiftly in this process we dont want to 
go to the other extreme and create another masaryk myth 
official praise in staterun media and school textbooks is still 
tentative 
but at the american embassy in prague there is an annual 
outpouring of respect for masaryk each oct 28 hundreds of 
czechs many of them elderly gather around a plaque to masaryk 
anthems are sung poems recited and heads bowed in memory of 
masaryk a staunch friend of the united states 
two regulars at the ritual are masaryks only surviving 
relatives in prague his granddaughters anna and herberta 
they are also among the leading lights of an unofficial masaryk 
society that counts prominent dissident vaclav havel among its 
supporters 
despite their tribulations in the stalinist 1950s because of 
their name anna and herberta masarykovna now in their late 70s 
preserve the fondest memories of taticek and of the affluent 
1930s when prague was a center of civilization for all europe 
more robust than the english dowagers they resemble in bearing 
and fondness for gardening tea biscuits and homemade jam they 
reminisce in annas apartment a minimasaryk museum at the top of 
one of the innumerable twisting staircases of pragues magical mala 
strana district 
of course he does play a role and his standing is better and 
better every day herberta masarykova says of her grandfather 
but its difficult to say what people know 
terribly little adds her sister

vishwanath pratap singh is called king 
in manda the lonely north india domain he inherited from his 
father but singh has his sights on a larger kingdom 
the 58yearold politician has emerged as prime minister rajiv 
gandhis main challenger in next months general election and as 
the rallying point of hopes to replace the government that has 
dominated india for most of its 42 years of independence 
singh is attempting to galvanize a coalition of opposition 
parties that span the ideological spectrum from communists to 
rightwing ethnic parties to oust the man he once called his 
friend 
but the groups collectively known as the national front are 
plagued by highly publicized feuds and have little in common except 
their opposition to gandhi and his congress party 
a month ago a unified opposition seemed possible as hindu 
activists joined ardent communists in mass demonstrations against 
the government but recent outbreaks of hindumoslem violence 
around india have led the communists and some centrists to question 
the viability of a broad opposition alliance 
it is hard to predict how if at all indias social economic 
and foreign policies would change if power switched from a congress 
to an opposition government in voting nov 22 24 and 26 
the national fronts platform apart from accusing the gandhi 
government of tolerating corruption makes no radical departures 
from the goals outlined by congress party governments both sides 
speak of easing poverty and strife in this ethnically and 
linguistically diverse country of 880 million people 
except for accusing the government of corruption singh has 
voiced few opinions 
political analysts say singh changes his ideological color so 
often and with such deftness that it has become almost impossible 
to put him in a definite category 
he has been nicknamed the mr clean of indian politics but 
he also has been called a fraud and villified by numerous people 
including former allies in the top ranks of the government 
vp singh is a cobra he was fed on the milk of the congress 
party and now he is injecting poison into the congress party 
said a congress party leader kalpnath rai he should be hanged 
for treachery 
singh a balding bespectacled man with a charlie chaplinlike 
mustache is aware of the importance of image but opposes 
personality politics 
i have always taken the stand that we have to shift from 
personal appeal to issues he said this is the way a democracy 
matures and its the issues which are agitating the peoples 
minds 
the biggest issue is the feeling that the people have been 
tremendously let down by the present regime and there is rampant 
corruption at the top he said 
when singh was 5 his biological father the rajah king of 
daiya gave him to the rajah of manda who was childless he grew up 
in one of the most palatial outposts in uttar pradesh state and was 
the sole heir to the estate when his adoptive father died six years 
later 
not allowed to see real family for years the shy young singh 
turned to poetry and painting 
prime minister indira gandhi outlawed royal titles in the early 
1970s but people in manda still call singh the rajah 
while in college singh became interested in politics and 
eventually joined the congress party in 1974 mrs gandhi named 
him a deputy minister of commerce and two years later promoted him 
to minister of state for commerce he served there until mrs 
gandhi was ousted in the 1977 parliamentary election that installed 
indias only noncongress government since the country gained 
independence from britain in 1947 
when she was brought back to power after the opposition 
government disintegrated in 1979 singh was inducted into her 
cabinet as commerce minister 
after mrs gandhis assassination in 1984 her son succeeded her 
and picked singh as one of the whiz kids who would lead the 
worlds most populous democracy into the 21st century singh became 
a champion of political morality a campaign for which he was 
sacked as finance minister and defense minister and then expelled 
from the congress party two years later 
although he made a great show of renouncing political office he 
was embraced by the opposition former congress party members who 
bitterly opposed mrs gandhi and later her son today the 
opposition at least for the moment has accepted singh as its 
leader his protestions about shunning positions of power have been 
set aside 
the oppositions battle cry has been a controversial indian 
government contract to buy 14 billion worth of artillery from the 
swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors indian newspapers have alleged 
that bofors paid middlemen up to 50 million in kickbacks to secure 
the 1986 contract 
the deal was negotiated by the prime ministers of the two 
countries and was supposed to be free of commissions and agents 
fees 
no one has been charged with any crime but the scandal has 
tarnished gandhis image many statements issued by the government 
in parliament have been proved wrong by documents uncovered by the 
hindu and other newspapers 
the scandal which has faded and flared intermittently was 
propelled back to the front pages recently spurring gandhi to call 
elections nearly two months before the jan 14 1990 deadline 
most analysts say the average indian voter has been numbed by 
charges of highlevel corruption and is more concerned about 
unemployment and rising prices 
i am not saying that corruption is a new thing or that there 
was no corruption before rajiv gandhis time singh said big 
money always has been close to politics 
but there was a difference the moneybags might have funded 
politics but they could not influence decisions politicians were 
like charioteers and big money was the horse pulling the chariot 
now rajiv gandhi has become the horse and big business has climbed 
into the charioteers seat

after more than a year of relative peace 
iraq on saturday accused iran of attacking one of its tugboats in 
the persian gulf and killing a crewman iran denied it 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit reported the incident 
thursday and also said an iraqi was killed 
it was the first report of a naval incident between iran and 
iraq since a ceasefire in their war took effect aug 20 1988 
there have been only minor reports of ceasefire violations on land 
the official iraqi news agency said the report was contained in 
a protest letter that its un representative gave to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in new york 
the letter said iran will be held responsible for the results of 
the attack ina said it did not elaborate 
iraq has said in the past that any shot fired on an iraqi vessel 
would be considered a serious violation of the ceasefire which 
ended eight years of war between the neighboring countries 
in its letter to perez de cuellar iraq said two iranian 
gunboats attacked the tugboat alintisar on wednesday morning close 
to the iraqi offshore oil terminal of mina albakr 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted navy 
commander rear adm mohammad hussein malekzadegan as saying 
iranian forces have not been engaged in any encounter in the 
persian gulf 
it is possible that the clash took place between two foreign 
forces stationed in the persian gulf and that the foreign media 
have wrongly taken one of them as the iranians he said in the 
report also monitored in cyprus 
malekzadegans comments came before iraq made its public 
accusation 
iranian reports at the time of the reported incident said iran 
was conducting naval maneuvers in the gulf but did not specify 
where 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit said thursday that two 
iranian gunboats fired at the tug 
it said an iraqi was killed in the incident which it said took 
place wednesday in the persian gulf off iraq about 30 miles from 
the port of faw

congress and the bush administration are 
struggling to write new rules governing citizen access to 
government information amid growing fear that the computer is 
becoming an engine for official secrecy 
current practices could turn ordinary citizens and volunteer 
organizations into information peasants while wellfinanced 
government business science and media interests become lords of 
the information age says columbia university political scientist 
alan f westin 
a survey westin conducted of nearly 300 research and lobbying 
groups concludes that they were better off in locating and 
obtaining federal public information in the 1970s than they are 
now 
the justice department meanwhile is conducting the first 
survey of how federal agencies release electronic data to citizens 
under the freedom of information act preliminary analysis shows 
that agencies adopt a more restrictive rather than a more open view 
of their obligations by a 31 margin 
this situation has emerged after a decade in which federal 
computer use has exploded the government owned a few thousand 
microcomputers in 1980 next year its inventory should reach 1 
million 
with limited public awareness that the problem even exists 
lobbyists officials and legislators in this city have been 
advancing rapidly toward farreaching decisions 
negotiations are under way to revise a bill submitted last may 
by rep bob wise dwva chairman of the house government 
information subcommittee if enacted the bill would present the 
first declaration by congress that government has an affirmative 
obligation to distribute its electronic information to citizens in 
a form they can use and at a price they can pay 
if warring interest groups can agree on issues like how much 
power to give the office of management and budget the bill might 
reach the house floor as early as january 
without warning last june omb announced plans to reverse a 
muchcriticized policy it had issued during the reagan 
administration in 1985 
the reagan policy still in effect as omb circular a130 
forbids federal agencies from developing any electronic information 
system that duplicates those available in the private sector and 
requires them to rely on private industry to disseminate government 
information in june omb said it was ready to adopt many of the 
principles of wises bill including encouragement of a diversity 
of private and government distribution systems 
so shocked was one watchdog group omb watch that its 
newsletter headlined the story hunger ends world declares 
peace and omb announces reform movement 
at the end of november the justice departments office of 
information and privacy will gather all the governments freedom of 
information officers to try to develop uniform policy on a range of 
issues such as whether citizens can obtain the software or 
programming used by the government to analyze data on its computers 
down the road are other issues some of which have already 
generated lawsuits like one over whether citizens can use the 
freedom of information act to read the electronic mail that 
officials send to each others desktop computers 
last week about 70 of the interested parties justice and omb 
officials legislators and their staff public interest and 
information industry lobbyists and lawyers librarians and academic 
researchers were brought together for a twoday conference by the 
benton foundation and the bauman family foundation 
their discussions made clear that those seeking electronic data 
from the government face serious obstacles in the way federal 
agencies interpret the freedom of information act a number of 
problems have involved a provision that agencies need not create a 
new record to respond to requests 
the phrase create a record was drafted when nearly all 
government information was on paper computer specialists say it 
has little meaning in describing how to extract information from a 
computer 
quin shea of the national security archive a washington group 
that collects government documents for researchers and news 
reporters cited a case involving the energy department asked in 
an foia request for a list of limitedaccess technical reports it 
said no such list existed even though all the titles were 
compiled in a computer 
the agency argued that its computer program matched names of 
eligible requesters with titles they were allowed to see but that 
asking for a complete list would amount to creating a new record 
the departments appeals office eventually overruled that 
decision but only after several exchanges with the archive which 
has proven its willingness to go to court and has the expertise of 
shea a former top freedom of information official at justice 
patti goldman a lawyer for public citizen litigation group 
argued that no new legislation is needed because courts have so 
far been applying the freedom of information act to electronic 
data the rush to amend the act is premature she said 
but the conference organizer jerry berman head of the american 
civil liberties unions information technology project argued that 
courts took 40 years to figure out that wiretapping violates the 
constitution and theres no guarantee all the rulings will come 
out right 
further he argued that court cases could pit impoverished 
public interest groups against wellfinanced private interests 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate subcommittee 
that oversees foia told the group im very hesitant to open up 
foia again unless there is a consensus among the various 
interests at the conference he said some members of congress still 
would like to gut the original freedom of information act 
former leahy aide john podesta argued that such a consensus 
should form around legislation to extend citizen access to 
electronic records noting that in this congress three agencies 
have sought exemptions from the existing act podesta said if 
the only proposals are on the bad side then only bad things will 
get passed 
but the wise bill is showing that federal information users 
agree more easily on problems than solutions 
conference participants agreed on the need for standardized 
computer formats and a list of government databases but those 
provisions have been dropped from wises bill because the american 
library association and some other groups worried they would 
entrust too much power to the office of management and budget

boosters of the everglades have told 
tales of woe for four decades but deterioration of the river of 
grass now may have reached a point of no return says a national 
park service biologist 
watching the park since 1965 john ogden has seen rookeries with 
10000 to 20000 birds disappear and witnessed a general decline in 
what was once an abundant wildlife sanctuary 
were just sticking our thumbs in the levee right now he 
said last week at a conference that drew 40 everglades scientists 
and their latest research i think most people agree we have come 
to a nowornever stage 
the litany of problems seems to grow longer with each new study 
human intervention in the form of urban development farming 
drainage flood control firefighting and the introduction of hardy 
exotic plants has cut the size of the everglades in half from an 
estimated 25 million acres in 1900 erased 12 native species and 
stressed what remains 
the florida panther and wading birds were subjected to the most 
intense study and as in past years the news is bad 
only a handful of endangered florida panthers a close relative 
of the cougar remains in everglades national park but a new study 
shows that the dwindling habitat may be able to support only eight 
to 10 cats apparently too low to make the species biologically 
viable 
water policies favoring farmers and urban dwellers have forced 
wading birds to relocate their colonies and cut the population in 
the southern everglades from 300000 to 15000 
rick smith of the governors office told the 6th everglades 
symposium that 163 million has been spent by the state since 
thengov bob graham declared the everglades a top priority in 1983 
progress is steady but its slow and we all need to recognize 
that smith said the spending is no small amount of money but 
its probably not enough 
federal and state agencies have obtained more than 275000 acres 
in recent years as a buffer zone for the park and are restoring 
some of the freeflowing channels that have been lost since the 
1940s in the shallow inland wetlands 
there is virtually none of this system left the way it was 
said steve davis wetlands research coordinator with the south 
florida water management district 
the district mandates water policy for the region but is being 
sued by the federal government for delivering polluted water to the 
park 
virtually every square mile of the everglades is not what it 
was in 1900 he said picking the time before settlers made their 
mark 
solutions revolve around park expansion southwest of miami 
water delivery to approach the historic natural flow and delivery 
of cleaner water possibly by buying land north of the park to act 
as kidneys filtering out unwanted phosphorus and nitrogen 
the everglades is a 12millionacre expanse of marsh grasses 
hardwood stands and pine islands but only about onethird is 
within park boundaries on the southern tip of the florida peninsula

duke ellington not one to take public positions 
on politics or politicians spoke through his music with the help 
of his son and his orchestra ellingtons melodic voice will be 
heard again 
the platform is a benefit sunday for the schomburg center for 
research in black culture the culmination of a yearlong 
celebration of ellingtons 90th birthday april 29 
ellingtons son mercer granddaughters mercedes ellington the 
choreographer and gaye ellington pianist billy taylor and tap 
dancer honi coles were among those scheduled to join the tribute at 
the shubert theater 
i feel that people didnt realize how much of a message he 
left in his works were going to put it right in front of them and 
tell it like it is said mercer ellington 70 
the only way you got to know duke ellington was not to know 
him but to know his music 
edward kennedy ellington died in 1974 after casting his black 
brown and beige spell upon the globe for nearly 50 years his 
output much of it scratched onto napkins envelopes and scraps of 
paper tucked in his pockets added much to the books of opera 
broadway church music film scoring and of course jazz 
take the a train by his collaborator and alter ego billy 
strayhorn satin doll a drum is a woman mood indigo 
sophisticated ladies it dont mean a thing if it aint got 
that swing and in the beginning god are just a few ellington 
standards 
i think hes one of the worlds great composers said 
taylor a phd in education who is wilmer d barrett professor of 
music at the university of massachusetts and a fellow at yale 
university 
his music reflects the sophistication the earthiness and the 
many other qualities we know about ourselves 
ellingtons music was a reflection of the man himself a man who 
supported the rev martin luther king and other causes but did not 
say so publicly said mercer ellington 
talking to ellington many times was like talking to your 
psychiatrist he would let you talk on the couch and cure 
yourself his son said he was a very hard man to pin down but 
he did make absolute statements 
the song money jungle for example meant that money was 
eternal grief whether you had money or didnt have money it was 
always trouble the younger ellington said all during the way 
he had money problems he supported a large family the song 
shows the turbulence that was gnawing away at him underneath 
the three black kings of another piece were actually the 
rev martin luther king king solomon and one of the kings who 
found christ in the manger 
take the a train was ellingtons paean to black imagination 
much of what he represented and believed in was harlem that 
this was the one subway stop that was the greatest harlem really 
meant black creativity mercer ellington said jazz is like 
baseball in the united states and the basic source for it was the 
black community 
marian logan whose late husband arthur was ellingtons good 
friend and physician recalled how ellington strayhorn and logan 
got caught in a hotel during a coup in baghdad iraq in 1963 
while planes bombed the palace near their hotel arthur and 
strayhorn were on the roof taking pictures said mrs logan 
edward was under the bed writing music

in a peaceful display of the popular desire for more freedom 
cheers went up when banners saying the truth will prevail 
and we will not let the republic be disrupted a popular 
communist slogan turned on its head by the demonstrators appeared 
in the crowd 
the crowd also chanted for tomas garrique masaryk the 
philosopher who founded independent czechoslovakia in 1918 the 
czechoslovak state came into existence on oct 28 1918 with the 
dissolution of austriahungary 
the communists consolidated power in 1948 and czechoslovakia 
remains one of the soviet blocs most rigidly controlled socialist 
states 
riot police appeared in side streets about 20 minutes after the 
demonstrations began and gradually moved in to disperse the crowd 
some people were beaten with police batons as they were led away 
to waiting buses dotted amid dozens of yellowandwhite riot police 
vans 
we want no violence hundreds of people chanted as they were 
penned in by riot police weve got bare hands they shouted 
raising their arms to the sky to show police they were unarmed

protesters still intermittently shouted freedom as police 
sought to disperse them

to old town square like wenceslas square a historic gathering 
place for czechs 
there they sang the national anthem and chanted more slogans for 
freedom before helmeted riot police again moved in to disperse the 
crowd 
the crowd was estimated at between 10000 and 15000 marking 
the largest antigovernment demonstration since august 1988 when 
10000 people marched for more freedom on the 20th anniversary of 
the sovietled invasion that crushed reform in 1968 
authorities had arrested at least 11 dissidents including 
havel to prevent them attending the independent rally but 
dissidents said other activists escaped the police dragnet and 
hoped to attend the protest 
todays march was held shortly after the communist government 
celebrated the anniversary of independence with a military parade 
in wenceslas square about 1500 soldiers stood at attention as 
defense minister gen milan vaclavik instructed them to swear 
allegiance to their socialist homeland 
in a 15minute speech josef kempny head of the 
communistdominated czech national council emphasized the 
importance of preserving communist rule he reiterated the 
government will not seek dialogue with opposition groups 
there is no sense in debate with those who like to talk but 
who oppose february 1948 and are against socialism who care only 
for the return of capitalism and who try to distract our honest 
workers from their work and to create chaos kempny said 
his speech drew only scant applause from an estimated 3000 
czechoslovaks who received special cards to pass through police 
cordons and metal barriers for the ceremony 
most attending appeared to be relatives of the soldiers who 
concluded the ceremony marching past kempny vaclavik prague party 
boss miroslav stepan and other dignitaries the officials stood on 
a reviewing stand draped in red cloth bearing the legend we 
serve the socialist homeland 
two rocket transporters carrying two missiles apiece and two 
armored personnel carriers were stationed on the square 
last year 5000 people rallied on oct 28 and were dispersed by 
riot police using dogs a water cannon tear gas and batons at 
least 87 people were arrested 
at the us embassy ambassador shirley temple black made a 
veiled call for more freedom in czechoslovakia in a brief speech 
before about 250 czechoslovaks honoring tomas garrigue masaryk who 
founded democratic czechoslovakia 
masaryk is now gradually being accorded a role in national 
history after being reviled for decades as a bourgeois capitalist

drug agents raided a cocaine laboratory 
seized 440 pounds of the drug and arrested a colombian believed to 
be the leader of a european narcotics distribution ring the 
interior ministry said saturday 
in a statement the ministry said authorities also arrested five 
other people in the raid on a warehouse in mejorada del campo 
about 20 miles east of madrid 
it called the laboratory the biggest in europe european 
authorities have noted a steady rise in cocaine consumption in 
recent years 
the operation came two days after us spanish italian and 
french drug officials met in madrid with representatives of latin 
american cocaineproducing nations to step up efforts to combat 
drug trafficking 
in the raid narcotics agents found that the drug had been 
worked into the fabric of alpaca wool blankets ponchos and 
sweaters and packed in numerous boxes in the warehouse 
police also seized about 260 gallons of ether a chemical used 
to transform coca leaf paste into cocaine and more than 50 bottles 
of compounds added to the pure drug to increase its quantity for 
street sales 
agents surprised two men as they began the chemical process to 
remove the cocaine from the blankets and clothing the ministry 
said 
police arrested luis carlos martinez henao of colombia the 
alleged leader of the organization and cubanborn americans luis 
de la cruz ferro jose antonio reyesdupont and dora rosa sanchez 
others arrested were pedro manuel tagle nino of peru and caridad 
gabriola bayolo believed to be a colombian no hometowns were 
given 
police accused martinez henao of running the european 
distribution of the shipmentthe interior ministry said more 
arrests were possible 
police conservatively estimated the value of the 440 pounds of 
cocaine at 8 million but the street value could be as high as 80 
million to 160 million 
a ministry spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
police believed the laboratory had just been set up 
in the past colombian cocaine traffickers have hidden cocaine 
in clothing to make it easier to smuggle the drug into spain 
mainly for later ground transport to other european countries 
the investigation that led to the raid included extended 
surveillance of martinez henao who had lived in lavish style in 
spain two years the statement said 
police said de la cruz ferro and reyesdupont had been in touch 
with martinez henao in madrid earlier this year 
the two traveled to peru but returned in september apparently 
after having arranged for a shipment of cocaine to spain the 
statement said 
spanish and international drug enforcement agencies have said 
spain is being used as a gateway into europe by latin american drug 
traffickers 
but recently miguel solans head of spains national plan on 
drugs coordination agency said increased police and customs 
efforts have led cocaine smugglers to turn away from spain and move 
more shipments into europe through ports in the netherlands 
britain and west germany 
colombian drug syndicates are believed to supply the vast 
majority of cocaine distributed in the united states 
the colombian government in august declared war on traffickers 
drug traffickers in turn have waged an almost daily campaign of 
bombings and killings of officials and journalists in an effort to 
intimidate the government into ending its crackdown

black candidates whose views and resumes place 
them in the political mainstream are breaking new ground as they 
seek white support in settings as varied as tidewater virginia the 
boroughs of new york and the neighborhoods of cleveland and new 
haven 
leading the way are l douglas wilder with his strong bid to 
make virginia the first state to elect a black governor and david 
dinkins who could become the first black mayor of new york city 
a former state legislator now in his fourth year as lieutenant 
governor of virginia wilder is running as a supporter of the 
fiscally conservative management of democratic gov gerald 
baliles who cannot succeed himself his opponent republican j 
marshall coleman contends wilder would take the state back to 
the days of higher taxes high interest rates and high inflation 
what was unthinkable only a couple of years ago has become 
inevitable said pollster ron lester when asked about the 
progress blacks were making attracting white votes while wilder 
and dinkins are attracting the most attention in the offyear 
elections to be decided nov 7 they are not the only candidates 
bidding for racial breakthroughs 
this years elections also are providing the first electoral 
test of the impact of the supreme courts recent decision on 
abortion 
like virginia new jersey is electing a governor and hundreds of 
cities from new york detroit cleveland and seattle to some of 
the nations smallest are choosing mayors in most cases 
incumbents seeking new terms face only token opposition 
voters in virginia and new jersey also are filling legislative 
seats while in maine a referendum asks whether people favor 
stopping cruise missile tests in the state 
the race to succeed republican gov thomas h kean of new jersey 
is between two house members democrat james j florio and 
republican james a courter 
while blacks seek new gains in virginia new york seattle and 
new haven conn and to build on earlier success in cities like 
detroit and cleveland the most prominent black in national 
politics jesse jackson has played a lesser role 
jackson has stayed out of virginia at wilders request 
i think jesse is an activist said wilder in an interview 
i have been involved with compromises getting half the loaf 
when you couldnt get the whole loaf i dont want to walk away 
emptyhanded 
lester who specializes in polling for minority candidates said 
the new wave of black politicians seem to have developed a 
particular way of connecting with the electorate if you look at 
most of them there is something about them that makes them more 
acceptable to white folks 
i think we are certainly seeing a kind of different appeal on 
the part of black candidates said linda williams a scholar who 
specializes in studying black political trends 
we dont hear the sort of rhetoric of our time has come 
instead we hear black candidates emphasizing their resumes and 
also emphasizing they are the people to bring about unity she 
said 
after the supreme court ruling last summer that would allow 
states to restrict access to abortions florio took a strong 
position in favor of abortion rights courter had earlier said he 
would sign legislation outlawing abortion but then asserted he 
would not impose his views on others 
courter aides conceded that we have had problems with the 
issue 
recently the new jersey campaign has grown increasingly nasty 
with each candidate portraying the other in television ads as 
pinocchio his nose growing with each new untruth 
despite the savage nature of the new jersey campaign it has 
drawn less national attention than the virginia contest between 
wilder and coleman 
the grandson of slaves the 58yearold wilder grew up during 
the period when virginias public facilities were racially 
segregated and has urged voters not to turn the clock back 
both candidates have avoided making race an overt issue in the 
campaign coleman said virginians see their contest just as two 
candidates running for office 
while race is avoided as an issue abortion has emerged as a 
highly charged element in the campaign and one that appears to 
work in favor of wilder a supporter of abortion rights 
coleman conceded that abortion was an issue that was hurting him 
and urged that it now should be put to rest 
dinkins held a wide lead over republican rudolph giuliani a 
former us attorney in early public opinion polls but the contest 
tightened dramatically when the democratic candidate was put on the 
defensive by reports he had undervalued stock he sold to his son 
and by remarks by robert c sonny carson a black activist who 
had worked in the primary campaign 
carson said it was wrong to call him antisemitic as many have 
charged im antiwhite he said 
dinkins lowkey style was considered an advantage when he upset 
flamboyant mayor ed koch in the democratic primary 
the contest for mayor of cleveland is between two blacks and the 
winner is likely to be the one who attracts the most white votes 
the cleveland race has been marked by bitter personal attacks 
from both candidates city council president george forbes and 
state sen michael r white 
forbes has called white a slum lord while the state senator 
has described the council president as a master of sleaze 
another issue in the race has been allegations denied by the 
twicedivorced white that he beat his first two wives 
in seattle norm rice a city councilman is given a better 
chance of becoming the first black mayor than doug jewett is of 
becoming the first republican elected to the office in 24 years 
in new haven black state sen john c daniels overwhelmed john 
destefano jr in the democratic mayoral primary last month despite 
destefanos backing from the citys democratic party establishment 
and the fact the city is about 70 percent white daniels is heavily 
favored to defeat republican robie pooley

last summer sandra day oconnor the first woman justice in the 
200year history of the supreme court gave chief justice william 
rehnquist the vote he had sought for 16 years a working majority 
to begin dismantling the roe decision written by fellow justice 
harry blackmun in 1973 
for now business continues as usual at most of the clinics and 
hospitals that annually perform legal abortions on three out of 
every 100 american women of childbearing age under the new ruling 
more than 95 percent could proceed without legal interruption 
because that is the proportion who get abortions earlier than the 
point at which the states may now intercede 
but with three more challenges to roe on the justices docket 
it may not be long before the court jettisons the landmark 1973 
decision entirely allowing states either to recriminalize all 
abortions or impose any of dozens of proposed restrictions ranging 
from mandatory parental or spousal consent to forced medical 
testing of the fetus and psychological counseling of the mother 
blackmun himself wrote that the signs his decision will be 
explicitly overturned are evident and very ominous and a chill 
wind blows 
some saw the missouri ruling as the grandest judicial 
affirmation to date of ronald reagans revolution others say it 
may prove ironically to unravel it the opinion of the courts 
majority simply is not shared by the majority of americans 
most polls including a media generalassociated press survey 
last summer say that by a 21 margin americans believe abortions 
should be legal but they are more evenly divided and in some 
cases tilt the other way on questions regarding public spending 
parental consent and related curbs 
charlotte taft director of a womens clinic in dallas puts it 
this way americans favor abortion only in the case of rape 
incest and their own personal circumstance 
democratic pollster peter hart says many republicans outside the 
religious right those in the suburban mainstream of the party 
have always given a wink and a nod to their candidates stated 
abortion views but now that the court has made abortion a hot 
political issue he says many will not find that acceptable 
anymore 
william schneider of the conservative american enterprise 
institute echoed that view when he warned gop politicians that 
suburban defections could drive a stake through the heart of the 
reagan coalition 
republican consultant roger stone however says the democratic 
party which unequivocally endorsed abortion rights in its platform 
last year stands to lose its last conservative bloc the urban 
bluecollar roman catholics 
there are no guarantees to any of these theories even the 
catholic coalition cannot be taken for granted despite the 
churchs vehement opposition to abortion indeed guttmacher 
researchers have found that catholic women are more likely to have 
an abortion than either protestant or jewish women probably 
because they practice less birth control another somewhat 
startling finding one out of every six women who have an abortion 
describes herself as an evangelical christian 
there will be some early clues on the political scene abortion 
is an issue in two gubernatorial races next month in new jersey 
and virginia as well as the mayoral contest in new york city and 
next year 36 gubernatorial races as well as the us house and a 
third of the senate will be fought 
the prochoice movement meanwhile is back on the march 
starting with a demonstration that drew more than 300000 people to 
the capital on the eve of the supreme courts hearing of the 
missouri case and it was buoyed last month by the florida 
legislatures wholesale rebuke of the antiabortion laws gov bob 
martinez tried to push through a special session moreover for the 
first time this decade the house and senate passed a bill that 
would have granted rape and incest victims federal assistance for 
abortions bush vetoed it this past week 
read our lips take our rights lose your jobs says kate 
michelman director of the national abortion rights action league 
at its 20th anniversary convention the league named nine 
politicians including martinez and sen jesse helms of north 
carolina as special targets for defeat next year 
according to larry sabato political scientist at the university 
of virginia abortion is likely to become the beirut of american 
politics a nowin issue california pollster mervin field says 
the nations 7500 state legislators are saying oh my god and 
wondering how they can control the damage 
the anitabortion movement meanwhile is content to take things 
one step at a time we believe the court will permit the states 
and congress to restrict the reasons for abortions says douglas 
johnson of the national right to life committee 
overall more than half the states are regarded as likely to 
enact some restrictions another eight to 10 are battlegrounds and 
10 to 15 are likely to retain full abortionondemand rights 
part of the strategy of abortion opponents is to create such a 
blizzard of consent and testing requirements that clinics and 
doctors will give up their abortion services as legally or 
financially risky the antiabortion shock troops meanwhile 
belong to operation rescue a largely white evangelical 
christian group that counts 35000 members and thousands of arrests 
while demonstrating at abortion clinics around the country 
typically its rescues entail forming a human blockade 
around the clinic while sidewalk counselors attempt to turn 
away the women trying to get through some protestors have entered 
clinics and damaged medical equipment with eggs and fake blood 
the group disowned by many in the antiabortion movement is 
led by young randall terry who carts a disfigured splotchy fetus 
he calls baby choice around the country in a jar of 
formaldehyde at news conferences he lays the fetus out in a tiny 
coffin lined with white satin terry a former usedcar salesman 
will point to the fetus and declare thats not a blob of cells 
thats a little girl 
operation rescue also distributes a video designed to evoke 
equal shock it features shots of aborted fetuses mixed with scenes 
of nazi concentration camps a somewhat milder video called the 
silent scream has been circulated for years by other 
antiabortion groups 
now the prochoice forces are distributing a video of their 
own produced by the fund for the feminist majority it is called 
abortion for survival and depicts an actual abortion that 
lasts 84 seconds and shows two aborted embryos amounting to about 
two tablespoons of blood and tissue the point is to demonstrate 
that what is swept from the womb in most abortions is not nearly 
the babylike figure depicted by the opposition 
whatever the tactics the abortion war looms like the civil 
rights struggle and vietnam as a long and painful one for the 
country the difference is that nobody predicts an end to this 
fight by law or by conscience

president daniel ortega said anew 
today that nicaraguas sandinista government will break a 19month 
ceasefire with usbacked contra guerrillas but he refused to 
say when 
i dont want to abuse the hospitality of costa rica and so the 
date on which the ceasefire will be suspended will be announced in 
nicaragua he told a news conference 
the leader of nicaraguas leftist government added however 
that he would keep observing the ceasefire if the united states 
decided to take the money it gives to the counterrevolutionaries 
and gives it instead to the united nations so that it can be used 
to demobilize the rebels inside and outside of nicaragua 
ortega had shocked a hemispheric meeting on peace and democracy 
friday by saying the ceasefire could not hold because of stepped 
up attacks by rebel guerrillas he made the announcement in a 
speech at the university of costa rica 
president bush at a news conference called it a shameful 
blow to democracy if ortega does end the ceasefire and renew 
hostilities he called ortega this little man in a military 
uniform and criticized ortegas conduct at the hemispheric 
meeting on democracy 
the ceasefire has been extended on a monthly basis since march 
23 1988 with the latest extension running out oct 31 
ortega said the fighting had never entirely ceased in nicaragua 
despite the ceasefire he said contra attacks since march 1988 had 
left 736 dead and 1153 injured with 1481 other people kidnapped 
or disappeared 
the waves of attacks by the counterrevolutionaries have 
increased enormously in the last few weeks said ortega 
he said thousands of contra troops had moved back into 
nicaragua the objective is the destruction of the electoral 
process in nicaragua said ortega who is running for reelection 
in feb 25 elections 
the drop of water that made the glass spill was an attack 
that killed 19 people last sunday ortega told an audience at the 
university of costa rica friday night 
after these savage attacks i met with the army high command to 
analyze the situation and the result of the analysis was that the 
ceasefire could not be maintained ortega said 
secretary of state james a baker iii promptly condemned any end 
to the ceasefire as a step backwards in a central american 
peace process that has been painstakingly promoted by costa rican 
president oscar arias 
baker said ortega must have been too ashamed to bring it up 
during a threehour meeting with 16 other hemispheric leaders here 
to help celebrate 100 years of costa rican democracy 
the ceasefire went into effect shortly after the united states 
halted military aid to the contras 
scattered fighting inside nicaragua continued but at a greatly 
reduced scale the united states kept up nonlethal aid as about 
12000 contra troops moved out of the jungle and into camps in 
honduras 
the fighting began to pick up again after five central american 
presidents noriega included signed peace accords on aug 7 
the accords called for disbandment of the contras in exchange 
for democracy in nicaragua and an agreement that all parties would 
stop supporting subversive movements in other countries 
in a surge of optimism that followed the accords and sandinista 
moves towards elections contra and sandinista commanders held 
battlefield parleys and the sandinistas suspended the draft 
but contra field leaders said they were not a party to the 
agreements and would not comply they said they had been betrayed 
and tarred by their association with the united states and its 
unsteady support 
israel galeano commander of the contra army began sending his 
troops back into nicaragua saying they were the only guarantee 
that the sandinistas would keep their promise to hold free 
elections 
nicaraguan defense minister humberto ortega daniel ortegas 
brother said sandinista forces would not attack contra positions 
but also would not allow them to move into new areas 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said ending the 
ceasefire is a serious blow to the central american peace plan 
we should all understand that the solution isnt easy 
baker said cristiani appealed to ortega at fridays meeting to 
stop shipping arms to rebels in el salvador but ortega made no 
reply 
when the first contras began marching out of their camps in 
honduras at the beginning of september some us officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said they feared that the powerful 
sandinista army would be able to wipe out the isolated and 
outnumbered contra groups 
sundays attack which took place on the last day of voter 
registration for feb 25s general election proved the contras 
are trying to deny the nicaraguan people their right to an 
electoral process ortega said 
we have to guarantee the safety of the nicaraguan people and 
the electoral process which means we have to organize the army 
better and means it is unacceptable for us to disarm ourselves 
he said 
baker warned that resumed fighting could be seized upon as a 
desperate effort to cancel the elections the linchpin of the 
peace process

the sixmonth house investigation of federal 
housing programs yielded dramatic tales of mismanagement and 
favoritism but failed to reveal definitively what roles former top 
agency officials played and whether they engaged in criminal 
activity 
we didnt crack the ring said rep christopher shays 
rconn we didnt nail down and expose what i think was a 
conspiracy to defraud the government 
the investigation by the government operations subcommittee on 
employment and housing began in april after a department of housing 
and urban development report found that a rehabilitation program 
was being milked for millions of dollars in excess rents and that 
subsidies apparently had been steered to developers who hired 
wellconnected consultants 
in 24 hearings the panel was told how hud failed to keep track 
of millions of dollars mismanaged programs and gave favored 
treatment to those with agency or political connections 
but the refusal of former hud secretary samuel r pierce jr and 
three of his top deputies to answer questions about their roles 
left a gaping hole in the investigation and also effectively ended 
it only a few more hearings are expected before the investigation 
is closed 
the question of whether there was criminal activity was left to 
the justice department justice department spokesman david runkel 
said friday that investigations are ongoing 
we have more than 700 open cases that involve up to 1000 
individuals or companies he said these are high priority 
items and will continue to be until this hud mess is cleaned up 
but runkel said attorney general dick thornburgh opposes 
congressional efforts to get him to name a special prosecutor to 
investigate hud 
federal authorities have in recent months reviewed records 
compiled by huds inspector general and the subcomittee and 
several grand jury investigations are known to exist 
the only way for the subcommittee investigation to make 
significant progress would be to secure the testimony of one or 
more of the former hud officials who refused to testify members of 
the panel said the only way to do that it appears would be to 
grant immunity 
the panels chairman rep tom lantos dcalif said friday he 
had no current plans to offer immunity to anyone but said he had 
not ruled it out in the future 
lantos appears to lack the support on the panel he would need 
for such a move 
i have no intention of playing god and trying to decide who 
should and who shouldnt be granted immunity said shays 
rep barney frank dmass said immunity was a very sensitive 
subject and should only be granted if approved by prosecutors 
one member of the panel speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said preliminary discussions with two of the former pierce aides 
about immunity had convinced him they would provide too little 
evidence to make it worthwhile 
even lantos who has appeared to relish his role in leading the 
televised hearings conceded the decisions by pierce and others not 
to answer questions effectively brought the subcommittee 
investigation to a halt 
the subcommittee has finished the bulk of its work he said 
that work included public testimony from 50 witnesses staff 
interviews with scores more and occasional theatrics 
with one notable exception the former hud officials 
consultants closing agents and attorneys called before the panel 
to discuss their activities said they had done nothing wrong 
the exception was marilyn harrell better known as robin 
hud who wept and read from scripture as she told how she easily 
stole more than 5 million from hud during her work as a closing 
agent on property sales and gave some of it to the needy she said 
she deserved to be punished and promised to repay 
other witnesses however defended their hudrelated activities 
which including reaping fees of up to 13 million for lobbying hud 
on behalf of developers 
paul manafort a prominent republican consultant conceded his 
work could be called influence peddling but said he broke no 
laws or hud regulations 
former interior secretary james watt matteroffactly defended 
his making 300000 to 420000 on one project alone for making a 
few phone calls to hud and sitting down with pierce for one meeting 
and bill taylor a national republican committee member from 
florida bragged about his ability to win hud work for his clients 
and blurted out a sarcastic good luck when told the goal of the 
hearings was to remove influence peddling from government 
he promised to stop cashing in on his political position as 
soon as congress does

compact discs showed 41 percent of people over age 10 had taped 
recorded music in the previous year 
that compared with 2122 percent in a 197879 survey but was 
about the same as 1982 the office of technology assessment said 
the survey also found that most people tape from their own 
recordings or those of family members and that they think the 
practice should continue to be allowed without extra compensation 
to recording artists or manufacturers but overwhelmingly they 
thought taping for sale was wrong 
tapers and nontapers agreed that taping to save money was 
acceptable but taping to make money was wrong the study said 
it is noteworthy that none of the alternative approaches of 
limiting recording technology or imposing new fees seemed to have 
an identifiable constituency among the public ota said in 
general tapers purchasers of prerecorded products and nontapers 
seemed to feel that it was fair to leave current home taping 
practices unchanged 
ota which advises congress on technological issues said the 
survey was conducted by phone with 1501 people last september and 
october the margin of error was plus or minus three percentage 
points 
ota found that 57 percent of those who had taped in the previous 
year thought they could have bought the material if they had 
wished of those 49 percent said they would have bought it if they 
had been unable to tape in 77 percent of the cases in which the 
taper could have purchased the taper said that if he or she had 
bought the recording it would have been in addition to other 
recordings purchased rather than in place of them 
the ota concluded that about 22 percent 57 multiplied by 49 
multiplied by 77 of the most recent tapings from prerecorded 
formats displaced sales of prerecorded music that might have 
otherwise been made if the respondent could not tape 
ota acknowledged however that the figure could be 
excessively high since other studies have shown that half or 
fewer of respondents answering affirmatively to hypothetical 
questions actually engage in the behavior being studied 
thus ota said the 22 percent figure should be considered the 
upper limit 
the ota noted however that the findings also indicated that if 
people were unable to make the tapes over threefourths of the 
tapes that would have been made would not be replaced by sales of 
prerecorded music 
the survey providing some good news for the music industry ota 
said 
music tapers in general had a greater interest in music 
listened to more music and purchased more recorded music products 
than did nontapers ota said 
while home taping certainly displaced some sales of 
prerecorded music sales of prerecorded products survey data also 
pointed to some stimulative effects home tapes had value in 
promoting songs and performers in addition a significant number 
of purchasers bought prerecorded products with the intention of 
copying them ota said 
most copying was for placeshifting that is copying music 
from records and compact discs to the more portable cassette format 
for walkmantype players and car decks ota said 
the result was that tapers were far more likely to purchase a 
record or more expensive cd than a prerecorded audiocassette the 
study said 
the study primarily was devoted to audio taping not video 
taping but the survey found that most videocassette recordings 
unlike their audio counterparts were made for temporary use 
primarily timeshifting for viewing at a more convenient time 
the supreme courts landmark mcasony case in 1984 said home 
video taping of overtheair broadcast material for timeshifting 
purposes was allowed the court did not address the taping of cable 
tv or pay television programs or the issue of library building 
of recorded programs ota said 
the ota survey found that 75 percent of those questioned thought 
it was acceptable to copy a record tape or cd they owned for their 
own use only 11 percent found the practice unacceptable 
most people 76 percent found it unacceptable to sell a copy 
made from their own tapes records or cds 
other findings showed that of respondents 17 years and older 
56 percent said it would be unfair to make recorders that wont 
copy and 55 percent deemed it unfair to make prerecorded music 
copyproof 
57 percent said it would be unfair to add a copyright fee to 
recorders to compensate recording artists for home taping and 59 
percent thought the same thing about a fee on blank tapes

president bush today denounced 
nicaraguan president daniel ortegas decision to end a ceasefire 
with the contras as a shameful blow to democracy but urged the 
usbacked rebels to refrain from military attack with elections 
looming in february 
at a news conference on the final day of talks with leaders from 
throughout the hemisphere bush sidestepped a question about 
whether he would seek a resumption of military aid to the rebels 
saying any such decision was premature 
i dont think the contras ought to attack he said of the 
small force of rebels operating within nicaragua what we ought 
to do is fulfill the agreements forged by costa rican president 
oscar arias under the arias plan ortega had agreed to hold free 
elections in nicaragua in february and the united states had 
withheld military aid to the contras 
bush spoke after ortega declined to specify when his own troops 
would resume offensive actions 
i dont want to abuse the hospitality of costa rica and so the 
date on which the ceasefire will be suspended will be announced in 
nicaragua he said 
ortega said he would continue observing the 19month ceasefire 
if nonlethal american aid currently going to the contras were made 
available only to demobilize the usbacked rebels 
the rival news conferences demonstrated the extent to which the 
ceasefire issue had overwhelmed arias carefully planned twoday 
celebration of democracy the international gathering was 
ending later in the day with the dedication of a public plaza 
with both bush and ortega on the guest list 
ortega said friday night that he was ending the ceasefire 
because of savage attacks by contra forces on peasants trying 
to register to vote 
bush said the world was dismayed by the announcement and 
that a break of that agreement and a renewal of allout fighting 
would be a very bad thing for ortega 
the president made his comments after a meeting with a group of 
latin american leaders including opponents to ortega and panamas 
manuel antonio noriega to emphasize his distaste for the pair 
he chided ortega for being the only leader to wear a military 
uniform in this meeting of democracies and said the announcement 
was an affront to arias 
its a shameful blow to democracy bush said 
as for panamas leader he said the outlaw noriega regime 
simply must be replaced 
bush said it appeared that ortega might be hedging his threat to 
lift the ceasefire but noted that us officials had not had a 
chance to fully review his latest comments 
but asked whether the united states should be prepared to help 
the contras bush said 
youre asking me to buy into a hypothesis that might not be 
true i want to see what develops but he knows if there is a 
military offensive that is going to change the equation 180 
degrees 
asked to elaborate he said well let you know 
he grew more acerbic about the sandinista leader as his 
40minute news conference progressed describing ortega as that 
unwanted animal at the garden party 
he added we didnt come here to have any contretemps with 
this little man showing up at a democracy meeting in a military 
uniform 
the president urged ortega not to interfere with the elections 
set for next february and said the people of this hemisphere 
know the difference between real elections and sham elections 
discussions of drugs and debt issues dominated fridays 
openingday of the meetings but tensions between the united states 
and nicaragua overshadowed the threehour official session and a 
lavish state dinner friday evening 
going into the meeting the united states had refused to sign 
any communique stemming from the meeting if ortega also signed 
bush and ortega greeted each other at the opening session with a 
handshake but the nicaraguan president stung by days of hostile 
rhetoric from bush announced soon after the meeting that he was 
ending the ceasefire that had been in effect with the contras 
since march 1988 
the drop of water that made the glass spill over was the 
attack that the mercenaries launched on oct 22 the last day of 
voter registration when campesinos who wanted to vote were 
assassinated ortega told an audience of about 3000 at the 
university of costa rica 
he said 19 peasants had been killed 
us officials acknowledged skirmishing had occurred but said 
they could not tell who started it and secretary of state james a 
baker iii suggested the contras might have been defending 
themselves 
baker said he found it more than passing strange that ortega 
never mentioned the ceasefire in the threehour group meeting 
maybe he was too ashamed to bring it up there with the other 
heads of state in attendance baker said 
in nicaragua roger guevara leader of an opposition lawyers 
group claimed that recent attacks attributed to the contras 
actually were the work of government troops to impede the 
democratic process in this country 
but foreign minister miguel descoto said in a radio interview 
that the nicaraguan government has the responsibility to be 
absolutely firm against terrorism 
bush made a point of greeting both violeta chamorro the 
opposition presidential candidate in nicaragua and guillermo 
endara leader of panamas opposition at fridays opening session 
which they attended as guests 
observers contend that endara handily won the may 7 panamanian 
election that was subsequently invalidated by noriega 
baker said the leaders in their afternoon meeting discussed a 
proposed drug summit but no date or place was set

here is the text of president bushs 
news conference saturday 
first a statement and then some questions be glad to respond 
together with the other democratic leaders of the hemisphere 
ive just met with the leaders of the political opposition in 
nicaragua and panama and here in costa rica saluting 100 years of 
democracy these discussions sponsored by costa ricas main 
political parties serve as an especially fitting tribute to the 
spirit of the occasion and the spirt of the times and these 
courageous leaders left us with a stronger appreciation of the 
daily difficulties of the prodemocracy movements in these two 
countries i conveyed to them the encouragement and the admiration 
of the american people 
and its ironic that the shining example of latin american 
democracy in which we meet lies between two nations whose rulers 
have so long and so harshly ignored the will of their own people 
from cape horn to the bering straits from chiles promising new 
plebiscite to the alaskasoviet border we opened after 40 years a 
new breath of freedom has swept the americas with hope and freedom 
hope and opportunity and bringing us even closer to the worlds 
first completely democratic hemisphere 
a few nations however have been left behind shackled by 
failed ideology and failed leadership to the north the nicaraguan 
people have waited for democracy since they ended the somoza regime 
10 years ago that dictatorship and elections are planned for next 
february but to date there are some disturbing signs 
the world i believe is dismayed at mr ortegas announcement 
last night that he had unilaterally ended the ceasefire i 
understand there may have been some refinements on that today but 
that was what he said and its a shameful blow to democracy and 
the fact that no mention of this came during the course of the 
hours of dialogue that we all had the presidents of these 
democracies demonstrates just how shameful an act it truly is 
regarding the forthcoming elections as was so evident in 
panama the people of this hemisphere know the difference between 
real elections and sham elections and the hemisphere will not 
settle for anything less than free and fair elections the people 
of nicaragua know the kind of steps that the ruling sandinistas can 
take to show a real commitment to fair elections and the whole 
world will be watching this one and if the sandinistas dont allow 
fair debates and clean elections they confirm the dictatorship 
long before the elections even take place the world understands 
that no real democracy is threatened by the voices of its own 
people 
and its ironic that here we are and im so glad i came to this 
meeting to salute costa ricas hundred years of democracy it was 
very ironic there was only one man in a military uniform in this 
meeting of democracies 
speaking of military uniforms speaking of dictatorships to the 
south the outlaw noriega regime simply must be replaced this is 
not the judgment of uncle sam it is the judgment of the panamanian 
people and it is the judgment of history and it is the judgment 
i believe of every single democratically elected president who was 
at this meeting 
today noriega may think his leadpipe politics have won but 
hes won nothing more than a fragile status quo and democracy 
really will triumph in panama im confident of that its a 
question of when not if and by putting his own personal interests 
above those of the panamanian people noriega will only continue to 
lose support internationally inside the panamanian defense forces 
and among the growing number of courageous panamanians who dare to 
resist his oppressive rule 
let me assure you the united states will continue to work with 
the democracies in this hemisphere and around the world to support 
the struggle of the panamanian people today every continent is 
being swept by the new breeze of political change and the world 
has watched in wonder as brave men and women have taken to the 
streets to claim their rights to proclaim a faith in democracy 
some governments respond with reform some with repression but 
there is no longer any doubt which side history is on the day of 
the despot the day of the dictator is over finished 
the nicaraguans and panamanians with whom ive just met are 
brave and inspiring people they stand in the vanguard of history 
and they deserve the active support of all who support democracy in 
this hemisphere 
id be glad to respond to questions

q mr president mr ortega says that the ceasefire wont hold 
because of what he calls savage attacks by the usbacked 
contras to what extent does the united states bear 
responsibility for the actions of the contras and what kind of 
instructions will you send to the contra field commanders now in 
view of the end of the ceasefire 
a well first i wont listen to mr noriegas charge that this 
is his outrageous breach of this alleged breach of the 
ceasefire willingness to breach it is entirely ortega willing 
to bear the burden put it all on the contras there have been 
flareups up there we have encouraged the contras not to take 
aggressive military action and we would certainly continue to do 
that but to accept his judgment that some excuse for ending the 
ceasefire rests totally on the contras im not going to do that 
at all 
q inaudible did you say that you wont encourage them not 
to take aggressive action 
a oh yeah well 
q ceasefire is ending and theyre going on the attack 
a whos that 
q if the sandinistas are ending the ceasefire to go on the 
attack 
a well i think theyre violating and breaking the very very 
agreements theyve made if they do that and i dont think they 
should and i dont think the contras ought to attack 
what we ought to do is fulfill the agreements that have been 
made they agreed to stop subverting their neighbors for example 
im talking about ortega and the sandinistas my golly the other 
day we uncover a great truck of munitions going in and one of the 
dramatic moments yesterday was when mr cristiani the fairly 
elected president of salvador in a very diplomatic way i might 
add told him stop sending that stuff into our country you 
agreed you wouldnt do it and now youre doing it you agreed to 
talk to the resistance 
thats who they ought to talk to hes always kind of sidling up 
to me looking for some photo op what he ought to do is talk to 
the resistance thats what he agreed to do why doesnt he do it 
and he agreed to release the political prisoners not so hasnt 
done it 
conditions for free and fair access to the media they agreed to 
that and that hasnt taken place the way it should theres some 
signs that are good the registration lets say hey thats good 
were encouraged some 90 percent supposed to have registered no 
government resources are supposed to go to the campaign im told 
that has been violated 
so rather than find a canard rather than find some hook to 
break up an agreement on i think they ought to go forward and 
honor the agreement thats been made and i would also say i would 
encourage the contras in every way possible not to engage in 
military action 
q what are your options what can you do since its very clear 
that you are at a meeting where i would say most of the latin 
leaders would not want to resume military action or aid to the 
contras and so forth thats obviously this is the peace 
meeting so what do you have in mind what have you done so far 
knowing this for 18 hours or so 
a well one of the things i did is talk to those who have a 
little more influence with mr ortega than i do that would be 
everybody at the meeting probably and talked to several of them 
last night and they leaned on him pretty hard and there was to 
be fair about it im told at a press conference the man had a 
little bit of backing off a little bit and so lets wait and see 
is what im saying but right now i could use this forum to say do 
not break that ceasefire 
q inaudible 
a well were not going to cross that bridge till we get there 
yes way in the back yes sir 
q mr president i am journalist from el salvador and i want 
to do a question specifically of my country 
a sure 
q the first are are there any signs that peace in el salvador 
is near and what are these signs and the other one is with 
respect to the human rights in el salvador would you say that your 
government is satisfied 
a i would say on the first part and i got this from the other 
presidents a recognition that the election in el salvador free 
and certifiably fair was an important major step towards the peace 
that the people of el salvador want i must say that the shipment 
that was discovered of mr ortega shipping military weapons into 
into el salvador in a direct violation of this these agreements 
was a bad sign but what was the second part of your question 
so in other words i am more encouraged about peace there i 
believe mr cristiani is trying very hard and let me just say he 
has the full support of our government whatever that whatever 
we can do to help him facilitate the peace and to enhance the 
democracy 
there was a second part though that im not sure i responded 
to

president bush today defended his 
veto of the district of columbias 34 billion budget saying he 
will stand like a brick wall against any attempt to use public 
funds for abortions 
bush here for the western hemisphere meeting on democracy 
vetoed the measure friday despite protests that the veto could 
impede the citys anticrime effort 
the bill would have restored the district of columbias ability 
to pay for abortions for poor women with local taxpayers funds 
not federal money bush last week vetoed a 157 billion 
appropriations bill for the departments of labor health and human 
services and education that would have allowed medicaid to pay for 
abortions nationwide for victims of rape or incest 
asked at a news conference how he justified blocking the 
district of columbia from using its own funds for abortions bush 
replied 
i dont think public money ought to go for that except in the 
life of the mother they can push me for political advantage 
every time they want to and theyre going to be up against a brick 
wall 
the people that are being victimized by those kinds of 
political games are the people in the district of columbia bush 
said 
city council chairman david clarke complained that a 32 million 
extra federal payment for a series of anticrime measures will now 
be delayed for at least a month 
the president has shown his willingness to sacrifice the 
public safety of the citizens of the nations capital in order to 
appeal to a oneissue constituency clarke said 
mayor marion barry said we find it ironic that at the same 
time the president is vetoing this anticrime antidrug 
appropriations package he is in costa rica to celebrate the 
centennial of democratic rule in that country yet while he is 
away we are having dictatorial rule here in washington 
the budget was for the fiscal year that began oct 1

a draft report by a defense department study 
group says homosexuals trying to join the military have stronger 
qualifications and fewer problems in their backgrounds than their 
heterosexual counterparts 
these results appear to be in conflict with conceptions of 
homosexuals as unstable maladjusted persons the report by the 
defense personnel security research and education center concludes 
the center analyzes what kind of people can be trusted with 
classified information 
the report conducted early this year was leaked to members of 
congress who want the pentagon to reverse its policy against 
allowing gays and lesbians into the military 
us rep gerry studds dmass an avowed homosexual gave a 
copy friday to the associated press 
the report compares the background records of 166 gays and 
lesbians who entered the military and were subsequently discharged 
because of their sexual preference with those of heterosexuals who 
were in the military 
the preponderance of the evidence presented indicates that 
homosexuals show preservice suitabilityrelated adjustment that is 
as good or better than the average heterosexual the reports 
author michael a mcdaniel concludes 
the 23page report looked at school conduct records thinking 
skills adjustment to military life and substance abuse 
homosexuals performed better except in all except the drug and 
alcohol abuse categories 
the report cautioned that relatively few homosexuals were 
surveyed in the report compared with some 42000 heterosexuals 
less confidence should be placed in conclusions drawn from small 
samples mcdaniel said 
one argument against homosexuals in the military it that they 
pose security risks because someone could use the threat of 
exposure to blackmail them into spying studds said that removing 
discrimination would remove the problem 
the report is the second in as many weeks released to media 
organizations that raises questions about the pentagon policy 
toward homosexuals a longer 1988 study by the same center 
concluded that the pentagon should let homosexuals enter military 
service 
the new report makes no policy recommendation but instead 
suggests further study 
defense department spokesman jim turner said the earlier report 
was rejected because it was not responsive to the original 
research request whether there is any connection between personnel 
security and sexual orientation 
turner said a completed report from the center on that subject 
is expected by the end of the year he said the second report also 
had not been released because it was in draft form and had not gone 
through a complete review 
the pentagon currently stands by its policy against homosexuals 
in military service homosexuality is not compatible with 
military life turner said 
several court decisions have upheld the militarys policy 
although a federal appeals court in san francisco determined in may 
that career officer perry watkins could reenlist because the army 
had known of his homosexuality when he reenlisted in the past 
the defense department policy which discriminates against gays 
and lesbians employs precisely the same arguments used against 
blacks and women before they were integrated into the armed 
services namely that their inclusion is contrary to good order 
and discipline studds said 
but studds says there is no political climate in congress to 
pressure the pentagon to change 
studds accused the military of withholding the reports from 
congress and the public simply because they ran contrary to current 
pentagon policy 
the new report is another eloquent statement requested by and 
then subsequently rejected by the pentagon he said

scientists say there is a 90 percent chance a 
quake as strong as the one that just wrecked part of the san 
francisco area will hit the moreunprepared eastern united states 
within 20 years 
all of japan is subjected to risk so japan thinks about it an 
awful lot said engineer michael orourke california thinks 
about it a fair amount in the east i dont think the public 
awareness is at the level where one would like it to be 
earthquakes were relatively common in the eastern states in the 
17th 18th and 19th centuries but few have occurred this century 
that has raised fears that tension is building deep underground 
waiting to be suddenly released in a damaging tremor 
there have been some studies recently which indicate that the 
chances of a significant quake with a reading of 65 and above is 
greater than 90 percent in the eastern united states within the 
next 20 years orourke said in a telephone interview 
orourke a civil engineering professor at rensselaer 
polytechnic institute in troy ny said such a quake would 
affect more people and there would probably be more damage because 
of the differences in building code requirements in california as 
opposed to the east 
robert m hamilton a seismologist at the us geological survey 
in reston va said the new madrid mo region which was hit by 
major tremors in 181112 is considered one of the most hazardous 
in terms of potential earthquake activity in the east 
that could be serious for cities such as memphis and st louis 
that are built largely on sediment deposited by the mississippi 
river over the centuries 
it was similar mud fill in the bay area where the greatest 
damage occurred in san francisco and oakland said hamilton filled 
land in a former lakebed also was blamed for the massive 
destruction in the mexico city earthquake a few years ago 
a devastating quake struck charleston sc in 1886 and 
serious quakes also have been felt around boston connecticut the 
virginiawest virginia border along the st lawrence valley in 
upstate new york and in parts of illinois utah and other states 
a tremor shook jamaica bay in new york in the 1800s such a 
tremor if repeated today could cause as much as 7 billion in 
damage to the borough of brooklyn the late robert l ketter has 
said 
ketter who was director of the national center for earthquake 
engineering research in buffalo ny told a senate subcommittee 
last year that a destructive earthquake is almost certain to strike 
the eastern united states sometime in the next two decades 
while scientists cannot predict when or where the quake might 
hit or its strength they consider one almost sure to occur in the 
east before the year 2010 ketter said 
its an almost sure thing we just dont know where or 
when said dr james e beavers an engineer with martin marietta 
energy systems in oak ridge tenn 
beavers warning is detailed in a study of the earthquake hazard 
to energy systems published by the american association of 
engineering societies 
particularly vulnerable to tremors in the eastern states he 
noted are schools largely constructed of unreinforced brick and 
masonry many deaths and injuries could result if a quake struck in 
the eastern states during daytime hours 
orourke said that in structures not designed to resist quakes 
such as homes similar amounts of damage would be expected in 
either california or the east 
but larger buildings termed engineered structures in 
california are designed to meet fairly stringent building codes and 
thus would be expected to withstand seismic shaking better than 
similar facilities in the east said orourke 
also he said people in the west have planned for 
earthquakes there are emergency response plans which 
municipalities have utilities water systems and so forth in 
the east that kind of planning has not been as common 
in 1811 and 1812 a series of quakes shifted the land around new 
madrid mo so drastically that the mississippi river was said to 
flow backwards for a time the huge reelfoot lake in northwest 
tennessee was created by that tremor and the ground shook as far 
away as washington dc 
a similar series of tremors could be expected to kill 200 to 
5000 people injure 8000 and leave an estimated 250000 homeless 
in the nearby memphis vicinity scientists have estimated damage 
would extend to such cities as paducah ky carbondale ill 
evansville ind poplar bluff mo and little rock ark 
an additional problem for the east is the fact that quakes there 
are felt over a larger area than those that strike the western 
states 
the attenuation is different in the east than the west 
explained orourke if you have a have a magnitude 7 quake in 
california the distance that people feel it is maybe 100 to 
250 miles if the same event occurred in the east the area able to 
feel the motion would be much larger because the damping in the 
rocks in the east is not as large as in the west 
he compared the east to a puddle of water where you throw a 
stone in and waves move outward and said the west is more like 
a puddle of heavy oil where the waves die out rapidly 
also quakes are not as narrowly defined in the east in 
california the tremors occur along the san andreas fault which 
divides two great plates of the earths crust in the east the 
nearest plate border is the middle of the atlantic ocean so quakes 
in the eastern states are at the center of a giant plate rather 
than along an edge 
its as if you had a large disk and were pressing at the edge 
and it cracked somewhere in the middle as opposed to two disks 
rubbing together said orourke

there have to be some kind of stick employed here in terms of the 
contras now arent you honorbound to help them defend themselves 
if indeed the sandinistas are about to unlaunch some sort of 
offensive against them 
a well if it resulted i mean youre asking me to buy into a 
hypothesis that may not be true 
q he talks of breaching it 
a well hes talking about it and youve got a lot of 
presidents here that are trying to tell him that would be sheer 
folly so i want to see how it develops but he knows that if 
theres an allout military offensive thats going to change the 
equation 180 degrees 
q mr president you have placed great faith in regional 
diplomacy your relations with leaders in this hemisphere like the 
leaders gathered here what does it tell you about the 
effectiveness of such an approach when a man like daniel ortega 
feels free to walk into a gathering like this and at this very 
meeting announce an action which is an insult to every leader here 
and a violation of the agreements that youve cited 
a it tells me that i should not judge the whole hemisphere by 
one i heard it i heard one of our leading tv journalists use an 
analogy about an animal at a garden party yesterday and i wont 
do it because it might take on different but thats exactly what 
happened so am not going to judge a salute to democracy a 
hundred years of costa rican democracy by the fact that mr 
ortega looks like that unwanted unwanted animal at a garden party 
and im so what youre doing is focusing on and i 
understand it the controversy the one thing there has been 
the feeling on parts in some countries here of neglect by the 
united states under this president there will no longer ever be a 
feeling of neglect and we came here to talk about debt and drugs 
and democracy and were not going to let this one little man who 
is out of whack with the rest of the hemisphere ruin a very good 
meeting 
q doesnt it suggest sir that he feels he has nothing to fear 
from the regional diplomacy by which you have set such great store 
when he feels free to do what he has done here 
a if he goes forward with it yes and it will bring down on 
him the outrage of every president and those that invited him here 
im sure will be terribly disappointed but we didnt come here to 
have any contretemp with this little man showing up in his 
military uniform at a democracy meeting thats not what its all 
about were talking about much broader things but well lets 
wait and see how that develops he knows the united states 
position and he knows the position of others in the hemisphere 
q do you foresee a change in us policy towards latin america 
directly because of this meeting 
a i see an enhanced interaction and i dont see a dramatic 
change because im one and our defense i mean our secretary of 
state and our interests have long been intertwined with those in 
this hemisphere but i see a day of the democracy hemisphere 
total democracy

defense secretary dick cheney on saturday 
reaffirmed washingtons military commitment to west berlin saying

surround the divided city

government leaders and visit us troops he arrived in west berlin 
late friday after two days of talks with west german leaders in 
bonn

said berlin would likely be one of the last places where troop 
reductions would be made under future superpower disarmament 
agreements 
my personal view is that we couldnt make any adjustments as 
long as west berlin is surrounded by large numbers of soviet and 
east german forces cheney said 
cheney said the us engagement in berlin will continue to see 
berlin stays free and he lauded the courage and determination 
of west berliners who stand in an outpost of freedom in a sea of 
communism 
he also called on communist east germany to tear down the berlin 
wall which he said continues to be a symbol of a philosophy 
which leads to oppression of people 
the three allied powers the united states britain and france 
have a total of 12500 troops stationed in west berlin active 
duty us forces number about 6000 
the alternative list the farleft partner in west berlins 
coalition government has called for a 10 percent reduction of 
allied troops in the city

for two days in bonn to discuss nato defense needs in an age of

you look at the changes that are taking place that have taken 
place in the last few years and that are likely to take place just 
in the next few months and its very optimistic and we want to be 
a constructive part of helping with the debt problem that i heard a 
lot about yesterday we want to help where we can enhance 
democracy and strengthen the concept of free elections 
so i wouldnt say dramatic change but i think being here and 
saying what i feel about the democracies here and trying to show 
the respect we feel for those democracies is a good thing to have 
done 
q oscar arias invited here the democratically elected 
presidents are you questioning his decision of inviting daniel 
ortega 
a well i was a little surprised to feel that he was 
democratically elected though they reminded me that there was an 
election im not sure how certifiably free and fair it was but it 
was under that under that rubric that he was invited here so 
who am i to question our host im glad to be here myself 
but it did seem a little odd walking in in a military uniform 
and you know coming in having pledged democracy to the 
organization of american states eight or nine years ago and 
frustrating the democratic ambitions of his people it wasnt 
exactly the most comfortable fit but no im not questioning mr 
arias hes the host and hes been a generous host and im very 
glad were here to salute costa ricas democracy 
q mr president id like to ask you about another foreign 
policy subject theres very strong evidence that israel is 
involved in a joint project with south africa to build a nuclear 
missile if that project should continue what effect would it have 
on us relations with israel 
a well we i hope our position is clear in transfer of any 
military technology that should not be transferred and if thats 
taken place it would not enhance relations between us or any 
country that does that it it would complicate things theres no 
question about that 
q another question on that same general subject sir will the 
united states give isreal a veto over the identity of the 
palestinians in negotiations on elections in the occupied 
territories 
a we are not we are not going with preconditions on we are 
trying to be a catalyst and whatever is worked out between the 
parties will have our our generous and enthusiastic support but 
the israelis have made clear that that would be very difficult for 
them so were not trying to throw down a precondition were just 
trying through the baker five points and through giving support to 
presidents mubaraks 10 points to be helpful in getting the talks 
going and the main thing is to talk and i hope that theyll get 
together 
q mr president you mentioned that if theres an allout 
offensive this would change the equation 180 degrees what exactly 
do you mean are you talking about more military aid again to the 
contras 
a well let you know well let you know but i dont see i 
dont want to get out ahead of where i think things may be right 
now youre pressing me to act as if there is a fait accompli and 
all barriers are down and shooting starts on all sides i dont 
want to argue that that is whats going to take place and but i 
can tell you a break of that agreement and a renewal of allout 
fighting would be a very bad thing for ortega because i think the 
whole world would see it as a direct breaking of his word and then 
we would see what kind of action is taken

history placed malcolm x and martin luther king 
jr on opposite ends of a philosophical spectrum but their 
daughters have found a middle ground 
yolanda king and attallah shabazz are cofounders of a theater 
company nucleus which tours the country with its production 
stepping into tomorrow a play with a stayinschool message 
for young people 
they live on opposite ends of the country ms king in atlanta 
and ms shabazz in los angeles this weekends performances at the 
martin luther king jr center for nonviolent social change gave 
them several days to get together as friends for the first time 
in five years 
maybe well try to see a movie next week ms king joked 
not everybodys father was one of the most important black 
leaders of all time one who led thousands with his own brand of 
moral thought before being felled by an assassins bullet 
but thats the reality for both ms king and ms shabazz 
theres a bond between us because of the way in which our 
fathers achieved their success ms king said their notoriety 
came through the people the people being the least of these the 
left out and oppressed and exploited so its a different kind of 
celebrity status 
the two men had vastly different views on ways to achieve 
equality for blacks king believed in black liberation through 
passive resistance and malcolm x advocated violent confrontation 
before he converted to traditional islam and became elhajj malik 
elshabazz 
but their daughters point out that their fathers did have one 
meeting albeit brief in washington in 1964 and malcolm x went 
to selma ala when king was jailed there but prison officials 
wouldnt let him visit ms king said 
the reality is that there was a real effort made to kind of 
keep them separate she said 
i feel that there was a sense of brotherhood ms shabazz 
said i feel that there was an uncle in king for me 
the daughters met in new york in 1979 while both were trying to 
eke out careers in the performing arts they were introduced by a 
writer friend who pointed out how much they had in common and 
thought their getting together would make a heck of a story 
after the guy invited us to do the interview i said oh 
fine sure it is kind of coincidental that these commonalities 
exist ms king said there was something there from the very 
beginning 
but both were a little apprehensive 
i was nervous just nervous because this was martin luther 
kings daughter somebody famous who is the child of someone you 
admire ms shabazz said 
and also a little concerned about what her impression of me 
and my family might be based on the perpetuation of how the public 
always portrayed our parents malcolm and martin at ends at 
odds competing 
that interview led to offers to speak to young people then the 
creation of nucleus it also left them on the road together with 
a lot of time to talk 
it got rid of the formality ms shabazz said we got to 
hear about daddy not malcolm or martin we got to hear about the 
one who rode you on the back of the bicycle it was moving for 
us something that kept bringing us together 
the fact that our fathers were assassinated puts us in a 
different place in terms of the way people reach out ms king 
said i think very few people could share that with me

just 36 hours after helping free buck helm 
from the wreckage of the collapsed nimitz freeway in oakland two 
rescue workers were busy seeking a missing hunter in the sierra 
nevada 
jim mendonsa and don stone have orchestrated countless rescues 
as members of the tuolumne county search and rescue team but never 
has one followed so quickly on the heels of another 
after awhile the memory fades but those two backtoback 
thats going to to be there forever certainly its an event of a 
lifetime mendonsa said in a telephone interview friday 
helms rescue after 85 hours beneath tons of concrete and steel 
that had been a doubledecker highway before the 71 magnitude 
quake oct 17 was touted as a miracle but mendonsa who with 
stone coordinated both rescues found the lesspublicized search 
for hunter lee fetzer more challenging 
for lee it was like looking for a needle in a haystack for 
buck the needle was right in front of you it was just a matter of 
reaching in and getting it mendonsa said 
with buck once the medics got there we knew wed get him out 
alive with lee we werent sure if wed get him out alive 
mendonsa and stone had been back from oakland for only a day and 
a half trying to recover from their exhaustive earthquake efforts 
when they received word tuesday that fetzer 24 was missing in the 
stanislaus national forest 
fetzer became lost after tracking a wounded buck into the woods 
and got caught by a swiftmoving storm that dumped 6 inches of snow 
over the area the odds of finding him in the large search area 
5000 feet above sea level were very slim after temperatures had 
dropped to below freezing mendonsa said 
fetzer an experienced hunter and volunteer firefighter helped 
himself by hiking to lower elevations away from the storm and found 
shelter before nightfall each day said mendonsa he was rescued on 
thursday 
on the other hand mendonsa said he never doubted that the helm 
rescue would be successful even though he was found in what 
mendonsa described as the most unstable part of the freeway 
frankly i felt comfortable with it i didnt do anything i 
felt was unsafe said mendonsa the only think that on occasion 
would kind of pop up in the back of my mind was an aftershock

q just the second part of that why did ortega do this do you 
think 
a i cant figure it out its an offense to the president of 
costa rica it is an offense to the democratically elected leaders 
here it is the most outrageous use of a meeting on democracy that 
i can think of i ask our own folks what in heavens name would 
make a person do something so counterproductive stick him out 
like a sore thumb amongst a bunch of democratically elected 
leaders offend a host and im sure it has you can ask oscar 
arias but if i were him i would have been deeply offended by such 
brutal disregard for the feelings of the sensitivities of this 
meeting 
so i dont know what motivates this man i did see him there 
yesterday and you know i knew you all wanted to see the photos 
and the confrontation thats boy scout stuff i mean theres no 
you know he wants to talk to me talk to the resistance thats 
what he agreed to do thats who he ought to talk to dont go 
sliding around for some photo opportunity that means nothing 
q mr president i just wanted to get one domestic policy 
question in here 
a fire 
q at a time when youre endorsing and youre celebrating 
selfdetermination abroad and youve endorsed state initiatives in 
so many areas like education at home how do you justify refusing 
to allow district of columbia residents to use their own local tax 
money to fund abortions for poor women 
a i dont think public money ought to go for that except in 
the life of the mother my position is so wellknown there and they 
can push me for political advantage every time they want to and 
theyre going to be up against a brick wall so lets forget it and 
get on with helping the people in the district of columbia and 
thats what they ought to do and not try to play games to think 
that ones going oneup or onedown on this very personal very 
difficult question of abortion 
my position is spelled out was defined openly debated in the 
elections a year ago maybe to this very day and im not 
changing my position and they know that and if they think theres 
political advantage in pushing me to the wall fine but the people 
that are being victimized by those kinds of political games are the 
people in the district of columbia 
q mr president there seems to be a consensus that the 
government that should be in power in panama at this moment is mr 
endaras since he won a fair election however hemispheric 
presidents passed up the opportunity to recognize that government 
last september could you explain why this happened 
a it happened because there was an action the presidents 
agreed to work with the oas and to back strongly back the oas 
mission and in my view the oas mission failed in its mission 
and that was to get noriega out of power and then go forward now 
youre having some constructive suggestions by felipe gonzalez the 
prime minister of spain by others at the meeting here 
but i can whatll be the next step i cant tell you but it 
i am not put it this way i am not totally frustrated about the 
return of democracy to panama i think that the thing i sense from 
these leaders is such solidarity with free and fair elections and 
that was what happened in panama that the handwriting is on the 
wall for mr noriega 
but whether at this juncture recognition of that government 
would be a constructive step or not id want to talk to others 
itd have to be done in concert with other nations to be 
meaningful and we are encouraging people not to give any kind of 
formal recognition to the existing crowd by you know not having 
their ambassadors there and all 
q in your discussions here did you move in any sense a step 
closer towards a drug summit did you get strong support on that

a i made very clear in my comments yesterday that we look 
forward to the having this andean drug summit whether any plans 
were finalized on it i dont know id have to ask our experts 
whether could we have had some discussion of trying to pin down 
with particularly with the colombians what would be a good 
timeframe for that but i personally didnt go any further than 
just saying we enthusiastically support the concept and we will be 
pleased to attend 
q have any of the others asked to get involved in the 
a ah not to me they didnt this this topic got a lot of 
interest and discussion but it didnt get into the modalities of 
the summit that i know of but maybe there was some 
behindthescenes work with it 
q in spanish 
a the second part of your question no i do not believe in 
legalization i am firmly opposed to it and i salute colombia for 
its unwillingness to negotiate and bargain with these insidious 
narcotraffickers first part was on the summit yes i answered 
that in english a second ago but yes i would be happy to attend 
such a summit and i think its worthwhile and i made that point 
yesterday in my intervention 
q mr president id like to take you back to the question of 
a moment ago about the reports of an israelisouth african 
collaberation on the missiles senior administration officials say 
its clear something is happening 
a on whats that 
q on on israelisouth african reports of israelisouth 
african collaboration on missiles transhipment of technology 
administration officials say its clear something is happening i 
want to know sir given this countrys historical reluctance to 
impose sanctions on israel what kind of leverage we have to deal 
with the situation what are you prepared to do 
a well youre asking me to accept a hypothesis that im not 
accepting but ive said that whoever it is the transfer of 
forbidden technology is taboo were not going to have that and we 
will find ways to assert that with any country that abuses the 
system 
q mr president president sarney of brazil said 24 hours ago 
that he was very frustrated by the state of relations between the 
united states and latin america he told us that he perceives that 
latin america is not a priority for the united states and that 
democracy without economic vitality is not enough as far as panama 
and nicaragua do you have an announcement to make to latin 
america a positive announcement 
a yeah you know i didnt i didnt detect that high level of 
frustration on president sarneys point he made a very strong and 
very an emotional appeal on the debt question and i can 
understand that and we are trying to work with him the one theme 
i detected through this meeting was strong support for the brady 
plan and the fact that we have moved and the fact where it has 
taken place in mexico capital flight capital is coming back 
into the country by doing some of the necessary reforms why they 
have for example deregulation of transportation they have 
reduced the cost of transportation by about 30 percent i am told 
so things are moving 
but i i sensed an urgency by president sarney i can identify 
with it and we do want to be helpful but i think he i had a 
chance to talk with him last night i think he was very pleased we 
came i think he was very pleased we are not in the united states 
or indeed canada neglecting our friends in this hemisphere and so 
i left with a pretty upbeat feeling not a diminished feeling of 
the importance of his problem but in terms of the hemispheric 
solidarity you might say 
but i your having phrased the question that way i want to be 
sure were not missing a signal with him hes going out of office 
next year he has done a good job under extraordinarily difficult 
times i went to his inauguration and i dont think anybody ever 
came into office in any country under more difficult difficult 
times 
so i would salute him and say if hes frustrated about the 
debt i can understand it but im not going to let that nor 
should he in any way interfere with what i think are improving 
relations with brazil look over our shoulders and it wasnt long 
ago that brazil did not have the democracy that president sarney 
has tried to perfect even in spite of enormously difficult 
economic times

aids patient gary lee brown has been told 
he has just three to six months to live but when the earthquake 
hit he ran for his life like everybody else 
im not giving up the 30yearold man said i dont want 
to die im not ready to go 
brown and others among this citys 3000 aids patients suffered 
special problems in the oct 17 earthquake 
already weakened by the virus their immune systems made them 
more susceptible to illness while huddled outside the quake 
provided another layer of stress atop the fear of dying and 
crucial home health services were disrupted as some nurses could 
not reach their patients 
on the positive side project open hand which normally provides 
1500 meals per day to aids patients expanded its normal services 
by sending 47600 meals to earthquake relief shelters in san 
francisco oakland and berkeley in the past week 
brown who weighs just 110 pounds and has trouble talking and 
breathing was lying in bed when the quake hit at 504 pm he 
rushed outside because falling plaster from the walls and ceilings 
made him fearful of remaining inside 
but with his immune system nearly destroyed brown caught a cold 
from spending four hours in his back yard he suffers from what is 
known as the wasting syndrome in which he continually loses weight 
his lover rick echols had to go back into their damaged 
apartment to get browns oxygen bottle 
then brown spent four days at the home of his lovers mother in 
sunnyvale south of san francisco to escape the dust raised by the 
collapsed plaster 
i came back and went into shock again said brown who has 
had aids for two years six days after the quake i went into the 
emergency room 
brown said he was lucky to have echols support 
i was able to deal with it a lot better than most aids 
patients he said especially those who were home alone 
the quake stranded some bedridden patients without telephone 
service or a nursing visit for more than a day said jacqueline 
mollema supervisor of visiting nurses and hospice of san 
francisco which provides home care for 600 people including 120 
aids patients 
in the first day we had absolutely no telephone contact with 
our nurses or our patients she said 
but many nurses took it upon themselves to visit the most 
seriously ill patients and there were no reports of anyone hurt by 
the delay in care she said 
steven petrow spokesman for the san francisco aids foundation 
said aids hot lines were down for six days making it hard for 
patients to call in for help 
the quake increased stress for aids sufferers at a time when 
they are least able to handle it petrow said 
if you are looking at someone with a lifethreatening illness 
and who may or may not be indigent and factor in the earthquake 
you are looking at a very full palette he said 
petrow also said the nearly 345 billion the federal government 
quickly produced for disaster relief is much greater than the total 
spent for aids programs this year 
spokesman james brown of the us public health service said the 
agency is spending 16 billion on aids programs annually and that 
the total federal spending is just more than 2 billion 
it heightens the low priority the federal government has given 
to aids petrow said weve had a natural disaster with this 
epidemic for nine years in the city 
he also said that private aids organizations in the area would 
likely be strapped for money as donations are channeled to the red 
cross and other relief organizations 
we are very concerned that we will see a big dropoff 
petrow said 
like others in the bay area aids patients were changed by the 
quake 
i dont think that ill ever settle down from that brown 
said it doesnt help when the news says we havent had the big 
one yet 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a 
virus that damages the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to death from infections and cancer no one is known to 
have recovered from aids 
as of midoctober aids had been diagnosed in 109167 americans 
of whom 64849 have died according to the national centers for 
disease control the chief victims of aids in the united states 
have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers

q one more 
a one more this is the last it really is were in real 
trouble on the time 
q you said earlier on 
a aside its all right 
q that the presidents last night leaned on daniel ortega 
twopart question is do you think ortega in fact hurt himself by 
what he did 
a yes 
q and do you think that its incumbent now on president arias 
to publicly say so since theres one more ceremony left of this 
meeting 
a i think that he hurt himself because i think these leaders 
here to celebrate democracy saw that this that this man is still 
a bit of an outcast in the whole family around that table and i 
think that unconscionable election to hold that press conference 
yesterday and as i say maybe hes backed off a little i want to 
be fair and he may have backed off about whether he stops the 
ceasefire or whether he fails you know whether it doesnt 
continue theres im told theres a little trying to interpret 
what he means by all that but yes he hurt himself very very 
badly i think 
and maybe maybe people will understand more clearly some of 
the reservations we have when they see him violate the agreements 
that mean so much to president arias and to the other to the 
other leaders that participate in the agreements i think the 
intervention by cristiani incidentally yesterday that nobody 
disputed of ortegas continuing to subvert the salvadoran 
democracy really was profound it was you could hear a pin drop 
when he said that and because everyone knows its true and 
everyone knows its in direct violation of an agreement made 
so i think he hurt himself and whether it will reflect himself 
in talks i dont know i do know that president arias got a hold 
of him last night and spoke very directly to him and im told that 
two other presidents you can guess about who they might be no 
you already had a question were spoke very very frankly to him 
q but if i may the second part of my question 
a youve had two parts this is the third part of a twopart 
question 
q im going for it etx 
a okay 
q the second part was shouldnt given that youve got 16 
leaders here shouldnt mr arias say something publicly not just 
 
a i would hope he would but i thats thats his call ive 
had a chance here and i feel better for it 
q why do you keep calling him a little man 
a because he is thats why laughter 
q thank you

hit a base used to fire scud missiles killing six soldiers and 
wounding 18 
markets again reported no deliveries of flour or fuel soldiers 
of the sovietsupported government were seen at several locations 
stopping taxi drivers and buying gasoline that has topped 16 a 
gallon 
throughout the day the capital was rocked by the vibrations of 
departing government rockets shot north to the salang highway the 
main supply route linking the capital with the soviet border 
government soldiers with knowledge of the battles said the 
northern part of the highway was held by moslem rebels they said 
government forces were trying to regain parts of the southern half 
of the road 
more than 2000 trucks carrying supplies for kabul were reported 
stuck on the highway north of the battles up until late last week 
when it was closed the salang had been the only governmentheld 
land route into the capital 
three other roads to the east south and west have been 
effectively closed to government trucks 
the governmentrun nightly news said 22 rockets hit kabul on 
saturday killing 12 people and injuring 24 government spokesman 
mohammed nabi amani said one hit a military base that houses the 
womens militia headquarters killing five women 
another missile hit a kindergarten and killed a young girl said 
abdul salam jalalin head of the childrens hospital 
more rockets landed near the polytechnic university in northwest 
kabul kicking up huge plumes of smoke several homes were 
destroyed but no deaths were reported 
witnesses said rockets also landed in a nearby military base 
but the government does not release data on military casualties in 
kabul 
a doctor speaking on condition of anonymity said the scud 
missile base was hit friday afternoon by several rockets the base 
is controversial because a us intelligence report has alleged 
that soviet soldiers are operating the base 
the soviet union said it pulled the last of its troops from 
afghanistan in february ending a decadelong intervention 
the doctor said six soldiers were killed and 18 were wounded in 
the attack all of them he said were afghan soldiers 
since june when rocket attacks on kabul intensified about 400 
people have been killed and more than 900 injured the government 
blames the guerrillas who say the government is rocketing its own 
people 
in pakistan the guerrillas afghan press news agency reported 
friday that government planes bombed a 40mile stretch of the 
salang highway to chase off guerrillas and allow un supplies 
headed for kabul to get through the guerrillas also claimed 
government troops bombed and rocketed villages along the road 
government spokesman amani denied it we never rocket 
villages he said 
a un official said some of the supplies on the salang were 
from a un aid shipment but that it only comprised several 
truckloads 
the guerrillas who have been fighting the communist government 
11 years say they want to cut off all food and fuel to the capital 
to force residents to flee then they say they will increase their 
attacks on the city 
when asked where the flour is merchants at the food markets 
blow imaginary dust from their fingertips 
its gone with the wind said one trader

a report requested by sen edward m kennedy 
a strong supporter of economic sanctions against south africa 
questions the value of such sanctions against south african gold 
even if enforcement were perfect most sanctions against south 
african gold might fail to generate substantial direct economic 
pressure the general accounting office said in the report which 
was released saturday 
kennedy dmass is a staunch opponent of south africas 
apartheid system of racial segregation and supports additional 
sanctions against south africa he had asked the gao to investigate 
sanctions against gold and diamonds both key exports from south 
africa 
the interim report released saturday dealt only with gold 
in an accompanying press release kennedy characterized the 
report as a significant breakthrough on the sanctions issue 
asked to reconcile that description with kennedys position on 
the sanctions issue an aide cited one section of the report 
dealing with discovery by a commerce department scientist of tests 
that can trace the country of origin of refined gold 
this technology gives us something we could not do before 
said kennedy aide david smith 
the report acknowledged that metals combined with gold in 
jewelry manufacturing may render the test ineffective 
kennedy would like to add jewelry made of south african gold to 
the list of gold items banned in this country most south african 
gold enters the united states in the form of jewelry mostly made 
in italy the report said about 800 million to 900 million worth 
of that jewelry is imported into the united states annually 
jewelry was excluded from a 1986 congressional ban in large part 
because it is difficult to establish the source of gold in imported 
jewelry kennedys office said 
as for the critical look at gold sanctions in general smith 
said we recognize both the porousness of sanctions and their 
limits 
but he added that sanctions have political symbolic and 
psychological effects such as lowering business confidence in the 
economy he said sanctions are one weapon out of several in the 
fight against apartheid 
imports of gold krugerrands and bullion are already banned 
congressional opponents of apartheid in addition to the jewelry 
ban are also mulling the idea of encouraging countries to release 
south african gold from their central banks and forcing investors 
to divest all holdings in south african gold mining shares 
throughout the report however the view of sanctions was gloomy 
even if there were no smuggling and other nations began to 
adopt a ban on imports of bullion south africa could sell its gold 
to many alternative markets the report said 
gold accounts for 45 percent of south africas export earnings 
and 10 percent of its government tax revenues the gao report said 
because the united states is the largest market for gold 
jewelry in the world and a customer for over 50 percent of italys 
jewelry exports it might be able to exert some leverage on jewelry 
makers to use nonsouth african gold the report said but 
because the boycott would be directed at imports from 
jewelryproducing countries rather than directly at south african 
gold bullion some chance exists that the united states would be 
accused of violating international free trade agreements 
if sanctions became so effective that mines began to close it 
would be difficult to reopen them in any postapartheid society 
the report said noting that the pressure of the earth on the deep 
mines would close them naturally 
on current bullion sanctions it said because little gold 
bullion was imported into the united states directly from south 
africa prior to the ban and because knowledge of the boycott in the 
gold market was not widespread the ban has had little actual 
impact reducing south african gold revenues or on the world price 
south africa could legally avoid sanctions by developing 
alternative markets and might benefit from unintentional 
speculative price increases the report said also releasing 
gold from central banks might harm other goldproducing nations 
at least in the short term by depressing prices 
congress in 1986 banned imports of south african minerals 
metals farm goods and products from governmentowned or controlled 
agencies

thousands of prodemocracy protesters took to the 
streets in two east german cities on saturday keeping up pressure 
on the communist government to adopt reforms 
about 30000 reform activists protested in plauen the staterun 
news agency adn said adn said another 6000 marched in greiz 
adn said marchers in both cities carried placards demanding free 
elections travel freedom and legalization of the prodemocracy 
group new forum 
according to adn many in the plauen march shouted enough 
talk we want action 
in greiz adn said many protesters carried posters showing 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev whose reforms they support 
also saturday east germanys new communist leadership hinted at 
further steps to decriminalize escape attempts to the west a day 
after tens of thousands demonstrated in at least six other cities 
across the nation for prodemocracy reforms 
meanwhile there were indications several east german political 
parties allied with the ruling communist party are seeking greater 
independence 
manfred bogisch a leader in east germanys liberal democratic 
party wrote in the party newspaper der morgen saturday that a 
multiparty system can only work when the political parties act 
and are true to their platforms 
west germanys zdf television network late friday said it had 
information that the liberal democrats and another communistallied 
party the christian democrats want to pull out of the national 
front the union of parties under communist dominance 
according to zdf the two parties want to campaign for more 
seats in parliament based on vote totals and not on a quota system 
set by the communist party 
the calls for greater political independence came one day after 
the communist government announced important concessions and after 
thousands took to the streets to demand reforms 
the demonstrations in dresden karlmarxstadt senftenberg 
saalfeld guestrow and grossraeschen late friday came despite a 
government decision to grant an amnesty for demonstrators for 
people who have left the country illegally and for thousands who 
were jailed for trying to escape 
the amnesty was the the most dramatic move that egon krenz has 
taken since he became communist party chief on oct 18 replacing 
hardline leader erich honecker 
the government said people who remain in the west after 
officially permitted trips are finished will be able to return home 
later without fear of prosecution 
the government also said it will restore free travel to 
czechoslovakia as of nov 1 restrictions were imposed oct 3 to 
stop a rush of east germans to the west german embassy in prague 
where they demanded to be allowed to go west 
travel restrictions have been among the most bitter complaints 
of east germans the new government has also promised to allow east 
germans greater travel freedoms to the west 
about 60000 east germans have gone to west germany since july 
via czechoslovakia poland and hungary 
by extending leniency to people who left the country illegally 
the government clears the way for them to return without facing 
criminal prosecution 
the amnesty covers incidents through friday and all prisoners 
included in the act will be released by nov 30 the government 
said about 4000 people are believed jailed for trying to flee 
west 
the countrys prosecutorgeneral guenter wendland said future 
laws were still under discussion but it is already quite certain 
that the regulation to prosecute those who dont return from 
allowed trips will not be in the amended law 
neues deutschland the communist partys official newspaper 
hinted in a commentary saturday that attempted escape might be 
further decriminalized if violence or force was not a factor 
the amnesty and the new travel law that is being worked out 
will require changes in the law relating to illegal flight the 
newspaper said 
a liberal travel law coupled with a decision not to prosecute 
those who leave and then decide to return would largely eliminate 
the need for daring escapes across the border 
the government said the amnesty also included people charged 
with taking part in illegal street protests during weeks of turmoil

million medicare beneficiaries pay to cover doctor bills will rise

the government on saturday offered 
600000 for the capture of either of colombias two most powerful 
drug lords more than doubling the previous reward 
the higher reward was offered in television advertisements run 
by the government which has been trying for 10 weeks to crack the 
highest levels of colombias powerful and feared cocaine cartels 
the government previously had offered 250000 for the capture 
of either pablo emilio escobargaviria or jose gonzalo 
rodriguezgacha the leaders of the huge medellin cocaine cartel 
the television spots run nationwide show a wanted poster with 
mug shots of the two suspects the ad offers 606000 for the 
capture of either man 
the government of president virgilio barco has extradited four 
colombians to the united states since the drug war began aug 18 
and nine more are awaiting extradition 
however all are middleranking traffickers none is on a us 
justice department list of the 12 mostwanted colombian 
traffickers a list topped by escobar and rodriguez 
us officials in colombia have said they believe escobar 
rodriguez and other top members of the medellin cartel are still in 
colombia 
the fugitives the officials have said are protected by bribes 
fierce loyalty of people they have helped and by outright fear of 
people who think they will be signing their own death warrants if 
they try to collect the reward 
the government declared war on traffickers following the aug 18 
assassination of leading presidential candidate luis carlos galan 
drug traffickers in turn have waged an almost daily campaign of 
bombings and killings of officials and journalists in an effort to 
intimidate the government into ending its crackdown 
meanwhile 10 young people were killed in the medellin area 
friday night including five women whose bodies were thrown from 
moving cars police there said saturday 
earlier this week the bodies of seven teenagers who had been 
shot to death were found in medellin the recruiting ground for 
drug traffickers private armies 
all of the 17 killed were between the ages of about 17 and 21 a 
medellin police spokesman said 
the bodies of the young women were thrown from cars in the 
fashionable neighborhood of el poblado shortly after midnight 
friday the police spokesman said asking not to be named 
earlier gunmen walked into a bar in the town of bello on the 
outskirts of medellin opened fire with pistols and killed three 
young men the spokesman said 
two more bodies of young men were found in bello tossed along a 
roadside the policeman said 
interviews with gang members in the past in medellin have shown 
that the gangs are trying to prove which are the most powerful and 
to emulate the medellin cartels leaders especially escobar 
escobar started out in medellin as a pickpocket and car thief 
forbes magazine ranks him as having between 2 billion and 3 
billion 
rodriguez also a billionaire was a pig farmer before he got 
into the cocaine business 
the apparent gang war killings came just hours after a young man 
with a submachine gun killed a state government official in 
medellin 
the victim was gabriel jaime santamaria the vice president of 
the antioquia state assembly and the state leader for the leftist 
patriotic union party 
santamaria was the 737th member of the party to be killed by 
death squads that the attorney generals office says are run by 
drug traffickers 
drug traffickers are attacking party members in revenge for 
attempts by leftist guerrillas to kidnap and ransom traffickers and 
their families the attorney generals office has said 
meanwhile bombings by drug traffickers have become so frequent 
that they are largely played down or ignored by colombias 
newspapers 
two bombs friday night that killed one person and injured two 
others got little attention in bogotas five daily newspapers 
saturday three newspapers didnt even publish news of the 
bombings and two others put the news on their inside pages 
one bomb went off at the private guaymaral airport on the 
northern outskirts of bogota police said saturday in a communique 
the bomb in a bathroom at the airport headquarters for narcotics 
police killed a policeman the communique said 
there have now been 171 bombings with 22 people killed and 220 
injured since the drug war began

foreign minister qian qichen toasted former 
president richard nixon on saturday for restoring ties between 
their nations 17 year ago and said the relationship must now be 
mended in the interests of world peace 
qian spoke at a welcoming banquet for nixon on the first evening 
of his private visit to china as a guest of the government 
the visit is nixons sixth to china beginning with the 1972 
trip that began a rapproachment after decades of hostility it is 
his most lowkey ever with even his schedule and length of stay a 
secret 
reporters were kept at a distance at the beijing airport when 
nixon arrived on a commercial flight and was greeted by vice 
foreign minister liu huaqiu he made no statement and was whisked 
off in a waiting car to the diaoyutai state guesthouse 
the overall interests of safeguarding world peace and the 
longterm interests of our two countries require us to make a 
success of chineseus relations the official xinhua news 
agency quoted qian as saying in his banquet toast 
chineseus relations are at a crossroads he said we 
sincerely hope that the us government will weigh the pros and 
cons and take a forwardlooking approach so that chineseus 
relations may return to the track of normal development at an early 
date 
qians comments were milder and more hopeful than any other 
recent government statements most of which have bitterly accused 
the united states of interfering in chinese affairs 
the united states has criticized chinas use of the army in june 
to crush student prodemocracy protests and its subsequent arrests 
of thousands of protesters and dissidents it also has given refuge 
in its embassy in beijing to two wellknown dissidents fang lizhi 
and his wife li shuxian and has told tens of thousands of chinese 
studying in the united states that they can overstay their visas 
for one year if they fear political persecution at home 
qian blamed the united states for the current tension but only 
indirectly and emphasized common ground 
the present difficulties in chineseus relations are not 
what we would like to see nor what we have created he said 
differences between china and the united states in social 
system ideology and other aspects do not necessarily hinder the 
establishment and development of normal friendly relations 
xinhua usually only summarizes and paraphrases banquet toasts 
but it quoted qian at length indicating the government intends his 
remarks to be seen as an important statement of policy toward 
washington 
xinhua said nixon described himself as a friend of china 
and expressed concern about relations 
he said ties between countries could not be based solely on 
friendship and that uschinese relations were essential to both 
sides because of shared interests 
a strong and stable china also is very essential to world 
peace and the two countries ties should be safeguarded and 
strengthened xinhua which only summarized nixons toast 
paraphrased him as saying 
nixon is the most prominent american to visit china since the 
june crackdown president bush has halted all highlevel official 
exchanges however nixons spokesman john taylor said the former 
president would report to bush after his trip

just 36 hours after helping free buck helm 
from the wreckage of the collapsed nimitz freeway in oakland two 
rescue workers were busy seeking a missing hunter in the sierra 
nevada 
jim mendonsa and don stone have orchestrated countless rescues 
as members of the tuolumne county search and rescue team but never 
has one followed so quickly on the heels of another 
after awhile the memory fades but those two backtoback 
thats going to to be there forever certainly its an event of a 
lifetime mendonsa said in a telephone interview friday 
helms rescue after four days beneath tons of concrete and 
steel that had been a doubledecker highway before the 71 
magnitude quake oct 17 was touted as a miracle but mendonsa who 
with stone coordinated both rescues found the lesspublicized 
search for hunter lee fetzer more challenging 
for lee it was like looking for a needle in a haystack for 
buck the needle was right in front of you it was just a matter of 
reaching in and getting it mendonsa said 
with buck once the medics got there we knew wed get him out 
alive with lee we werent sure if wed get him out alive 
mendonsa and stone had been back from oakland for only a day and 
a half trying to recover from their exhaustive earthquake efforts 
when they received word tuesday that fetzer 24 was missing in the 
stanislaus national forest 
fetzer became lost after tracking a wounded buck into the woods 
and got caught by a swiftmoving storm that dumped 6 inches of snow 
over the area the odds of finding him in the large search area 
5000 feet above sea level were very slim after temperatures had 
dropped to below freezing mendonsa said 
fetzer an experienced hunter and volunteer firefighter helped 
himself by hiking to lower elevations away from the storm and found 
shelter before nightfall each day said mendonsa he was rescued on 
thursday 
on the other hand mendonsa said he never doubted that the helm 
rescue would be successful even though he was found in what 
mendonsa described as the most unstable part of the freeway 
frankly i felt comfortable with it i didnt do anything i 
felt was unsafe said mendonsa the only think that on occasion 
would kind of pop up in the back of my mind was an aftershock

president bush said saturday that 
transfers of forbidden technology are taboo and it would not 
enhance relations if israel had defied the united states to help 
south africa develop an intermediaterange missile 
it would complicate things theres no question about that 
bush said at a news conference winding up a twoday meeting with 
western hemispheric leaders 
bush did not confirm or deny reports that israel has assisted 
the south african missile program in return for a steady supply of 
uranium 
the president said i hope our position is clear in transfer 
of any military technology that should not be transferred and if 
thats taken place it would not enhance relations between us or 
any country that does that 
asked if the united states might impose sanctions against israel 
or take other steps he said youre asking me to accept a 
hypothesis that im not accepting 
but i have said that whoever it is the transfer of forbidden 
technology is taboo were not going to have that and we will find 
ways to assert that with any country that abuses the system 
on another topic bush was asked if the united states would give 
israel veto power over what palestinians can take part in 
negotiations on elections for the occupied west bank and gaza 
were not trying to throw down a precondition bush replied 
were just trying through the baker five points and through 
giving support to egyptian president hosni mubaraks 10 points 
to be helpful in getting the talks going bush said 
in jerusalem israel radio reported saturday that baker had 
agreed to modify his proposed fivepoint framework for getting the 
two sides to the table to discuss elections 
the state radio gave no details but said the changes followed 
almost a week of intensive contacts between baker and foreign 
minister moshe arens over the peace offer 
arens had written baker earlier insisting the plan be modified 
to drop cairo as the site for preliminary israelipalestinian peace 
talks and that exiled palestinians be barred from participating 
arens also demanded that the discussion be limited to discussing 
israels election plan for the occupied territories not the 
palestinians desire for an independent state 
an israeli foreign ministry spokesman refused to confirm or deny 
the radio report 
baker said in washington on wednesday that we want to do 
everything we can to try and move things forward and therefore we 
will review the suggested changes that we have received but he 
added it would be much better if both sides would accept the 
five points as a general framework for moving forward

achievement testing saying the results are misleading and may even 
be hindering school reform 
shanker president of the american federation of teachers made 
the radical suggestion after a speech at the educational testing 
services 50th invitational conference in which he said many school 
districts are apparently shying away from reform ideas for fear 
they might drag down standardized test scores 
i would call for an immediate end to standardized tests as 
they are now shanker told reporters 
what you need to do is test for things that are really 
important reading writing computing history he said to 
test for depth of knowledge you have to get away from things that 
are machinegradeable 
he suggested that schools should demand and publishers produce 
new tests that measure ability to perform higherlevel academic or 
intellectual tasks such as writing sensible essays or computing 
multistep math problems 
such tests he said might resemble the national assessment of 
educational progress exams congressionally mandated tests taken 
periodically by thousands of 9 13 and 17yearolds measuring 
ability to read write and compute at different levels of 
sophistication 
children are being tested far too frequently shanker added he 
suggested that if students were tested at fiveyear intervals 
instead of every year or so educators might feel freer to innovate 
to better suit individual student needs 
shanker stressed that he was not antitest he in fact 
cautioned against siding with antitest groups because the public 
would conclude that school officials were simply trying to escape 
accountability but he nonetheless expressed strong agreement with 
many of the test critics arguments in his address before 650 
educators and testing experts 
he cited for example a recent study by dr john j cannell 
showing that 48 states and some 80 percent of local districts are 
reporting misleadingly above average standardized test scores 
that phenomenon has come to be called the lake wobegon effect 
after the mythical setting of author garrison keillor where 
supposedly all children are above average 
tests cited by cannell as being misleading include the 
california achievement test the stanford achievement test the 
metropolitan achievement test the science research associates 
test the comprehensive test of basic skills and the iowa test of 
basic skills 
but shanker did not extend his call for cessation of 
multiplechoice standardized testing to the scholastic aptitude 
test the college entrance exam taken each year by some 16 million 
high school students 
he said the sat did not have nearly the negative impact of other 
standardized achievement testing on school curricula but he said 
was concerned that the sat may sometimes act as a learning 
disincentive to some students who figure that they dont have 
to study hard as long as they do well on the exam 
the educational testing service administers the sat 
ets president gregory anrig in his opening address agreed that 
there was an overreliance on standardized tests in the name of 
reform 
he later told reporters that ets was in the midst of revamping 
the sat away from the purely multiplechoice format the new sat 
to be unveiled in 1994 might include essay questions and math 
problems to be solved without multiplechoice answers 
other conference speakers echoed shankers concerns over the 
magnified role of testing in the current school reform movement 
most current tests are working against the very reforms now 
required in our educational system said lauren b resnick 
director of the learning research amp development center at the 
university of pittsburgh 
typical standardized tests demand bits of information rather 
than reasoning 
tests perform the function of sorting and gatekeeping but 
often stop there said sharon robinson director of instruction and 
professional development at the national education association the 
result is limiting expectations and opportunity rather than 
expanding them

a liquor store owner took a stand against 
drinking by selling the contents of her shop saturday in a benefit 
for charity 
fay wood says she was auctioning off the inventory of her liquor 
store on the condition that the buyers empty the whiskey rye and 
scotch bottles onto the ground 
wood decided to close her store in april after hearing a man 
speak at a church meeting about the number of people killed by 
drunken drivers 
it was a real confirmation of what i was feeling i knew after 
that i had to go back and close the store she said thursday 
she returned to streeters package store the liquor store she 
has run for three years and the only one in this western 
massachusetts town and told a helper to turn off the refrigerator 
and close up early 
she thought i had gone off the deep end wood said 
until then wood had felt it was her customers own business if 
they wanted to drink even though she stopped drinking alcohol in 
1984 
wood who also has a hair salon says she will use proceeds from 
the auction to open a retreat for aids patients and their 
caregivers in southern vermont

mahatma gandhi told him how to meditate 
adolf hitler taught him how to work in a society of fear now 
journalist william shirer is tackling the mystery of leo tolstoy 
who walked into the moscow night and never returned 
at 85 shirer could bask in the memories of a career spanning 
such milestones as lindberghs transatlantic landing in paris 
gandhis india and world war ii but the author of the rise and 
fall of the third reich is too busy planning his next projects 
to think about retirement 
in a sense a writer never stops he probably should shirer 
joked its awfully difficult to stop you know as long as you 
have your marbles 
in five years shirer says he may give up his daily routine of 
writing each morning in a berkshire house stacked to the ceilings 
with books papers and the diaries he used to write most of 15 
books 
but until then theres a book to be written about why tolstoy 
walked out on his wife at age 82 dying a few days later its a 
question that has tantalized shirer for 20 years 
how could this happen to such a great man he says 
the journalist who proudly shows a visitor his back yard plot 
glowing with color and says he still likes to sail when his health 
permits has lived quietly in the berkshires since a brief second 
marriage in the 1970s 
in 1987 he married again this time to his 50yearold russian 
teacher irina lugovskaya who is helping him with the tolstoy 
research 
in a recent interview shirer recalled his career starting in 
1925 with a trip to europe after graduation from coe college in 
iowa 
all the students that year were going to paris he recalled 
america at that time had prohibition and coolidge was in the 
white house with his inane ideas if any 
the night before he planned to return to the united states 
shirer was hired by the paris office of the chicago tribune he was 
later fired and was again on the brink of returning when cbs radio 
hired him 
shirers memoirs of covering hitlers germany the nightmare 
years were recently made into a turner network television 
miniseries of the same name starring sam waterston as shirer and 
marthe keller as tess shirers first wife 
part of the nightmare was the dangerous task of getting 
information about the third reich he said 
a lot of our work was contacts with the opposition which 
wasnt very much he said we had to get out and get the story 
from pastors and priests and bishops and people like that 
and he says he wasnt always successful in convincing american 
editors about the horrors of the events unfolding in europe 
shortly before war broke out he was scheduled to do a feature on a 
dance festival but balked at the assignment 
it was the most horrible taste in the world he said 
shirer who covered india before going to germany said gandhi 
who tried to teach him meditation provided a great contrast to 
hitler 
its sort of ironic that in my journalistic career that the 
two great men that i spent most of my life covering were gandhi and 
hitler both of them genuises but hitler an evil genius he said 
he experienced the german leaders famed charisma firsthand at 
an art lecture in nuremberg in 1934 
it was a gloomy dank church it was sunday evening and he was 
talking about art about which he knew absolutely nothing except 
that it was bad and for two hours he spoke without a note and he 
held this audience absolutely shirer said 
by 1940 it was time to get out of berlin and shirer went 
becoming a radio commentator for cbs

jimmy swaggarts dalliances with a prostitute 
got him tossed out of the assemblies of god in 1988 but several 
church organizations have closed ranks behind the fallen television 
evangelist in front of the us supreme court 
swaggarts lawyers hope to persuade the nations highest court 
tuesday to overturn rulings that forced the louisianabased jimmy 
swaggart ministries to pay california 183000 in back taxes and 
interest for the years 1974 through 1981 they will argue that the 
california tax on bibles religious literature recordings and 
other items sold by the ministries violates religious freedom 
no other state has such a tax swaggarts attorneys say 
the national council of churches the evangelical council of 
financial accountability prison fellowship the national tax 
payers union the association for public justice and other groups 
have filed briefs on swaggarts behalf said william treeby 
swaggarts new orleans lawyer 
churches beyond the jimmy swaggart ministries realize this 
issue carries broad implications that would chill if not totally 
end the dissemination of religious messages especially across 
state lines said treeby 
if the court says you can impose this tax it will have a 
dramatic effect on all churches said charles r ajalat the los 
angeles lawyer representing swaggart its a very important first 
amendment case theyre talking about taxing bibles religious 
service tapes and religious music the sales of these items are 
really people making donations to the ministry 
california however claims that sales of tangible property are 
not protected by the constitution whether they are made by a shop 
or a church 
if a bible is sold in a bookstore its taxed thats the same 
as if a church sells it donations are taxexempt they can make 
all the donations they want but when they start buying and selling 
its another matter said gary jugum assistant chief counsel to 
the california board of equalization 
when swaggart ministries sells the bible treeby says its 
different 
a book store is in the business for profit jimmy swaggart 
ministries is a nonprofit organization he said 
in earlier appeals which were rejected by the california 
supreme court swaggart admitted that some items the ministry sold 
were subject to the tax jugum said those items included mugs 
bowls plates pen and pencil sets bud vases communion cups 
candlesticks replicas of roman coins tshirts bearing the 
ministrys logo and plastic replicas of the crown of thorns and ark 
of the covenant 
where do you draw the line if you put words from the bible on 
a coffee mug is that taxable or is it a symbol of religious 
freedom thats the danger here said jugum 
for the years at issue california and swaggart ministries 
estimate that sales from baton rouge la to california consumers 
totaled 17 million sales of merchandise at california crusades 
totaled 240000 
california has not taxed the ministry since 1982 pending 
appeal but if the supreme court rules against the ministry it 
must pay the state taxes based on its sales over the past seven 
years 
swaggarts baton rougebased ministry was once estimated by 
local officials to be a 150 million industry that changed in 
february 1988 when swaggart confessed to moral failure 
although swaggart never gave specifics a rival minister said 
the transgression involved liaisons with a new orleans prostitute 
swaggart was later defrocked by the assemblies of god 
swaggarts ministry is leaner now construction projects at his 
10 million complex were halted after many television stations 
stopped carrying his programs but it still remains a big industry 
in baton rouge 
ministry officials wont discuss specifics but tourism and 
convention officials said visitors are still drawn to the baton 
rouge area to attend camp meetings and revivals

two us representatives on saturday 
tried to persuade christian leader gen michel aoun to accept an 
arab leaguesponsored peace plan they also urged kidnappers 
holding western hostages to free the men 
democratic reps mary rose oakar of ohio and nick rahall of west 
virginia both of lebanese descent arrived in lebanon on saturday 
and held a threehour meeting with aoun in the bunker of the 
shellshattered presidential palace in baabda 
the announced reason for the trip was to discuss with aoun the 
peace accord approved a week ago by a special session of the 
lebanese parliament in taif saudi arabia it would shift political 
power to the moslem majority and clear the way for election of a 
president 
aoun has rejected the accord for not setting a timetable for the 
withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon and refuses to accept 
results of an election held in syriancontrolled territory 
the state department told the politicians their lives could be 
in danger in lebanon where eight american hostages are held the 
hostage held longest terry anderson passed his fifth birthday in 
captivity friday 
while our state department does not approve of this trip of 
ours they did state that they did not mind us coming and 
speaking with gen aoun said rahall 
ms oakar said aoun agreed with much of the peace plan but 
theres some missing link she said without elaborating 
thousands of aoun supporters met the two representatives at the 
palace carrying placards that read the us administration 
supports the taif conspiracy against free people and we need 
support and not intelligence compounds an apparent reference to 
the us embassy that closed last month 
in an address to the throng aoun said he would not honor 
presidential elections outside lebanons christian enclave 
any president elected outside lebanon will be president for 
those who elected him and any president elected in syrian 
occupied lebanese territory will be sa urrogate of theirs but only 
the one elected here will become president for all lebanon he 
said referring to the enclave north of beirut that is controlled 
by his army 
aouns stance on the elections complicates efforts to arrange 
for balloting within the period proposed by an arab league 
mediation committee which is no later than nov 7 
aoun did not say whether he would reject an election held in the 
nomans land of beiruts dividing green line which is controlled 
by neither his troops nor the syrians and which houses the current 
parliament 
rahall also announced that efforts are under way to reopen the 
american embassy in beirut 
we want to return our ambassador and reopen our embassy in 
this country and thats the first visible step of showing our 
commitment said rahall 
washington pulled ambassador john mccarthy and 29 other 
diplomats from east beirut on sept 6 after aoun accused the united 
states of supporting the presence of 40000 syrian troops in 
lebanon who were deployed in 1976 to quell the civil war 
the general has accused the united states of selling lebanon to 
syria out of fear for the lives of the americans held hostage in 
lebanon 
after speaking with aoun the americans crossed into moslem west 
beirut where they held talks with acting prime minister salim 
hoss who heads a moslem cabinet vying for legitimacy with aouns 
ms oakar paid special tribute to anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who marked his 42nd 
birthday in captivity friday he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
i want to make a special plea for terry and the others if i 
can she said we call on anybody that has any influence upon 
the hostage takers to release them 
there are a total of 18 westerners held hostage in lebanon

italy said saturday it was prepared to take the 
consequent decisions in the case of an italian who was shot and 
set on fire in libya during antiitalian protests 
the government called on libya to disclose the circumstances of 
the murder wednesday of roberto ceccato 35 
in an interview with italys state rai television friday night 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi said he had not heard about 
ceccatos slaying which has shocked italy and severely strained 
relations between the countries 
in a further comment that outraged many italians gadhafi said 
i hope he had life insurance 
the foreign ministry issued a communique saturday saying it 
preferred not to respond to gadhafis comments 
but it said italy would consider it inadmissible for the 
libyan side not to shed full light on the very grave incident in 
view of identifying the culprits 
the statement urged libya with maximum firmness to carry out 
a swift investigation italy it said was ready to take the 
consequent decisions taking into account the elements and evidence 
which come to its attention 
it did not elaborate some newspapers suggested the government 
could order the evacuation of the 3000 italians in libya and some 
politicians said italy should recall its ambassador or reduce its 
diplomatic staff 
about 100 people demonstrated outside libyas consulate in milan 
on saturday some throwing eggs or scrawling protests on walls 
the demonstration was organized by italys neofascist italian 
social movement which also declared a day of remembrance on nov 5 
for the italians who died in libya during the colonial period 
ceccato was slain wednesday night on the eve of day of 
mourning protests declared by gadhafi for libyans deported during 
30 years of italian colonial rule between 1911 and world war ii 
italian media reports said ceccato who worked for an italian 
farm products firm was found dead near the companys complex just 
outside tripoli he had been shot in the head and stomach and his 
body set on fire 
libyas official news agency jana said it appeared to be an 
ordinary criminal crime 
pressed about the death gadhafi said foreigners must have been 
responsible 
italys ambassador in tripoli giorgio reitano met with two 
libyan foreign ministry officials saturday and said they offered 
their condolences 
an italian policeman flew to tripoli saturday to join the 
investigation along with a doctor who will assist in the autopsy 
in the television interview gadhafi repeated his demand for 
reparations for the colonial period italy says it met its 
obligations with payment of 67 million under a 1956 agreement 
with the former libyan monarchy 
gadhafi also demanded an explanation from italy for its refusal 
to accept a boatload of 846 libyans who sailed to naples without 
visas to mark the day of mourning gadhafi suggested libya 
could retaliate by detaining italian ships that sail into tripoli 
and benghazi 
the interview appeared to be conducted inside a tent gadhafi 
clad in a black leather jacket sat casually in a swivel chair his 
comments were translated from arabic into italian by a libyan 
interpreter 
romes la repubblica newspaper called gadhafis comments 
cynical and impudent milans corriere della sera newspaper 
reported that the rai network was flooded by calls from hundreds of 
viewers angered by gadhafis statements

jacob wetterlings parents are not yet 
ready to look beyond sunday which marks a week since their 
11yearold son was snatched at gunpoint by a masked man less than 
a mile from their home 
ive been living basically moment by moment since sunday 
night said jacobs father jerry 
i thought by monday morning this is awful this is sick 
said jacobs mother patty a substitute teacher and pta president 
at her sons school this day after day i cant possibly 
imagine going through the weekend i cant possibly think beyond 
one minute at a time i really dont think 
jacob his 10yearold brother trevor and an 11yearold 
friend were accosted sunday night by a man dressed in black on a 
lonely stretch of road outside this central minnesota town of 
2200 which now display posters of the missing boy along with its 
halloween decorations 
the abduction occurred about 930 pm as the three were 
returning on bicycles and a scooter from a convenience store where 
they had gone for the first time after dark without an adult the 
man who was on foot and had no vehicle in sight asked the boys 
how old they were then held onto jacob and threatened to shoot the 
other two unless they ran into the woods 
the fbi released a personality profile of the type of person 
likely to have kidnapped jacob a handsome boy who plays goalie on 
an ice hockey team 
according to the profile the kidnapper is probably a previous 
sex offender a white male 25 to 35 years old with some type of 
physical deformity and is likely to work at an unskilled job 
state and local police as well as the fbi have been frustrated 
by the lack of evidence despite repeated aerial and ground surveys 
national publicity more than 100000 in reward money and appeals 
to stearns county residents to scour their property for clues 
wetterling 41 said they havent received any ransom demands 
and doubts that his work as president of the st cloud chapter of 
the national association for the advancement of colored people is a 
factor in the abduction 
gov rudy perpich who visited the family thursday activated 
100 minnesota army national guardsmen to expand the search 
the guardsmen plus another 100 department of natural resources 
employees began searching saturday at the spot where the 
sixthgrader was abducted and will fan out through the township 
said lt kent christianson of the hennepin county sheriffs 
department horseback patrols and dogs also are being used 
at home a note posted on the kitchen wall by his 8yearold 
sister carmen awaits jacobs return it reads in part you 
were on the radeo and the news evrybuty cryd very hard i am glad 
you are home now 
this family counselor of ours said to me wisely as i see it 
you only have one option and thats to know that hes fine and he 
will be home safe soon i just program that into my being said 
ms wetterling 
friends and relatives have been staying around the clock at the 
twostory frame home in a small wooded subdivision answering the 
phone and the door to shield the wetterlings from 
curiosityseekers most visitors bring gifts of food 
theres nothing anybody can do so they bring food said ms 
wetterling 39 im diabetic and everybody is worried about me 
eating but it just wont go anywhere she said as she began to 
cry yet again 
right now we have the luxury of having lots of support people 
around said wetterling whose chiropractic office was being run 
last week by a retired chiropractor who normally fills in during 
vacations 
carmen wakes up frequently at night and her 13yearold sister 
amy wont sleep alone but the psychological damage extends beyond 
the wetterling household 
a classmate of trevors 10yearold stephanie larson has had 
problems sleeping since the abduction said her mother sandy for 
a few days after the abduction stephanie made her mother accompany 
her to the bus stop even though ms larson can see it from their 
home 
the wetterlings believed it was safe for their sons and their 
friend to travel together at night to the store and now they dont 
know what to tell other parents 
thats the thing the teachers are having a hard time with 
because theyve also taught them to go in a group said ms 
wetterling now all of a sudden being in a group wasnt enough 
i have no advice we did everything we knew

president bush defending his veto 
of the district of columbias 34 billion budget said saturday he 
will stand like a brick wall against any attempt to use public 
funds for abortions 
the white house announced the veto friday as bush arrived here 
for the twoday conference on western hemisphere leaders on drugs 
debt and democracy 
the measure would have allowed the nations capital to use local 
taxpayers funds not federal money to resume paying for elective 
and other abortions for poor women 
bush asked at a news conference how he justified his action 
replied 
i dont think public money ought to go for that except in the 
life of the mother they can push me for political advantage 
every time they want to and theyre going to be up against a brick 
wall 
the people that are being victimized by those kinds of 
political games are the people in the district of columbia bush 
said 
del walter e fauntroy ddc conceded saturday that bush 
who won a veto fight in congress last week over federal money for 
abortions has the upper hand on the use of local money for 
abortions 
it is not likely that the house will be able to override the 
presidents veto any more than it was his veto of the health 
appropriations fauntroy said in washington the president 
seems to have all the cards at this point 
fauntroy said the district would probably use stopgap 
appropriations measures to continue city services until a 
compromise could be engineered on abortion funding 
washington mayor marion barry said after the veto we find it 
ironic that at the same time the president is vetoing this 
anticrime antidrug appropriations package he is in costa rica 
to celebrate the centennial of democratic rule in that country 
yet while he is away we are having dictatorial rule here in 
washington 
city council chairman david clarke complained that the veto 
means a delay of at least a month in getting an extra 32 million 
to fight crime the district has already recorded 364 homicides 
eight short of last years record toll 
the president has shown his willingness to sacrifice the 
public safety of the citizens of the nations capital in order to 
appeal to a oneissue constituency clarke said 
the budget bill was for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
congress earlier this week upheld bushs veto of a 157 billion 
appropriations bill for the departments of labor health and human 
services and education that would have allowed medicaid to pay for 
abortions nationwide for victims of rape or incest

when 45yearold mark anderson sat down to 
take the american college test on saturday the nervous high school 
students around him thought he was a proctor 
then they realized he was one of them 
anderson an admissions director at gustavus adolphus college 
took the test so he could understand what students go through 
trying to get into the school located in the nearby southern 
minnesota town of st peter 
im done im done im done anderson said after finishing 
the test in four hours 
anderson was easily the oldest test taker at mankato state 
university one of many testing sites around the country high 
school students taking the test with him couldnt believe he would 
want to take the act when he didnt have to 
at first they asked if i was the proctor for the test then i 
got that same look i get all the time what are you doing taking 
the test 
but by break time he said they were all swapping testtaking 
stories 
the act measures competency in english mathematics reading and 
scientific reasoning and is used by college admissions officers as 
one tool for selecting students 
and how did anderson do 
i know i got some questions right on the test he said 
chuckling 
but anderson who expects to receive his test results within 
seven weeks is coy about whether he will make them public 
well see how it turns out he said my office staff had a 
pool on what i would score

the nicaraguan contras weakened by 
a central american peace agreement and reduced us aid may have 
lost their military and political momentum but not their 
determination to overthrow daniel ortegas sandinista government 
ortegas plan to break off a ceasefire with the contras 
disrupted costa ricas celebration of 100 years of democracy and 
led president bush to hint saturday at the possibility of renewing 
us military aid for the rebels 
ortega said he was ending the 19monthold ceasefire because of 
stepped up contra attacks and accused the usbacked rebels of 
trying to subvert the electoral process bush angrily called ortega 
the unwanted animal at the garden party 
ortega is crying wolf said adolfo calero a contra leader 
in miami who accused the nicaraguan president of trying to subvert 
the elections scheduled for feb 25 
five central american presidents agreed aug 7 that the contras 
should be disbanded in exchange for democratic reforms in 
nicaragua the accord called for the contras to be voluntarily 
repatriated to their homeland by dec 8 
the contras in turn vowed not to disband quietly they left 
their home bases in honduras and began marching back into their 
homeland carrying old weapons and dwindling stocks of ammunition 
were sure well be able to make sure the sandinistas cant 
live in peace said contra army commander israel galeano in a 
late august interview with the associated press at his headquarters 
camp in honduras 
galeano said then the rebels would launch no offensive 
operations and would await the outcome of the elections 
if the elections are democratic well go back thats what 
were fighting for said a contra battalion commander interviewed 
then but we dont believe them thats why were here 
fighting had escalated in the last three weeks in nicaragua 
ortega said the straw that broke the camels back was a contra 
attack last sunday that left 19 dead on the last day of 
registration for the upcoming elections 
we havent been launching any attacks weve only been 
defending ourselves wilfredo montalvan a member of the 
nicaraguan resistances directorate said saturday 
theyre always attacking us because they want to liquidate 
us said montalvan who is based in san jose 
added bosco matamoros the chief contra spokesman in washington 
it defies any logic that 3000 men at the most could carry out 
any military operation in nicaragua 
in managua sandinista army spokesman carlos lara said the 
latest contra attack occured friday when a patrol of army and 
interior ministry troops was ambushed in northern matagalpa 
province lara said the patrol returned fire killing six contras 
the ceasefire which took effect shortly after the united 
states halted military aid to the contras was extended on a 
monthly basis by the sandinistas the current extension runs out 
oct 31 
the united states meanwhile kept up nonlethal aid 
scattered fighting continued at a greatly reduced scale even as 
us officials urged that the contras to stay in honduras and not 
to launch attacks 
ortega said saturday that since the ceasefire was implemented 
contra attacks had killed 736 nicaraguans and injured 1153 others 
he also accused the rebels of kidnapping or causing the 
disappearance of 1481 people 
with even nonlethal contra aid due to end in february contra 
officials in miami began to lose control and leadership was taken 
over by battlehardened field commanders 
when the first contras began marching into nicaragua at the 
beginning of september some us officials who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said they feared that the powerful sandinista army 
would be able to wipe out the isolated and outnumbered contra 
groups 
the contras had about 12000 troops in honduras camps when the 
accord was signed and claimed another 6000 in the interior of 
nicaragua 
we have too much morale and not enough bullets said galeano

firefighters and police will get some help this 
year from some 30000 volunteers and car telephone owners who will 
be on the lookout for arson fires set during devils night 
a dusktodawn curfew also is in place to guard against the 
threat of arson during the threeday devils night period that 
begins sunday and ends tuesday on halloween 
in tustin calif a group urged pet owners to lock up their 
cats until halloween is over saying the animals are being 
mutilated and tortured to death 
several southern california animal shelters also said they will 
not give away black cats until halloween is over fearing the 
animals may be killed or used as party novelties 
in carbondale ill police arrested 20 revelers as hundreds of 
college students blocked a downtown street early saturday morning 
despite efforts to defuse the annual halloween street party 
most of the arrests were for alcohol violations and came after 
about 300 people left a private party and joined a large crowd in 
the streets authorities said 
the devils night period named after the nickname for the night 
before halloween traditionally has been a time for pranks in 
detroit but it grew into a bout of arson that peaked in 1984 with 
810 fires that killed one person and left dozens homeless 
the number of fires in recent years has decreased steadily 
there were 229 fires reported during the period last year an 
average of 76 per night about 65 fires are reported on an average 
night in detroit fire officials say 
i assume if we have the cooperation of the people of this city 
we should be able to keep matters under control mayor 
coleman a young said 
the city council voted for a fifth consecutive year to impose a 
6 pm to 6 am curfew on youths under 18 during the devils night 
period 
more police officers and firefighters will be on duty and other 
city workers mayoral appointees and police cadets will patrol 
detroit streets to serve as additional eyes and ears young 
said 
block club members and citizens band radio owners will comprise 
many of the estimated 30000 volunteers expected to assist police 
in patrol work 
the cellular one telephone service will activate a tollfree 
number for reporting suspected arson during the threeday period 
the detroit fire department will activate a hot line of its own 
on sunday that program offers 1500 for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of an arsonist 
city officials also hoped steppedup demolition of abandoned 
buildings would present arsonists with fewer potential targets 
nearly 2000 such buildings have been torn down since july 1

a regional court ruled that striking coal miners 
in the soviet arctic were violating a new labor law but their 
walkout continued tass reported saturday 
the case indicated that the soviet unions increasingly frequent 
labor disputes are now to be settled by legal means until 
recently workers could expect strikes to be broken up by tough 
police action and leaders could expect long jail sentences 
the supreme court of the komi autonomous region ruled that 
strikers at the vargashor mine in the vorkuta region north of the 
arctic circle had grossly violated a law passed oct 9 by the 
national supreme soviet parliament 
the miners walked off the job wednesday to protest what they 
said was the governments failure to follow through on promises of 
improved economic and social conditions that ended a major walkout 
in july 
the vargashor mine is the largest of nine mines in the vorkuta 
region with a total of 18000 workers 
the court decision involved a suit filed by managment tass did 
not say when the court ruled 
the news agency said the court found the coal miners violated 
provisions of the new law that requires conciliation and 
arbitration commissions to be set up before a strike 
it said they also violated a provision requiring that a strike 
be approved by a vote of at least twothirds of the workers 
however there was no immediate indication that miners would end 
their strike or what kind of penalties the court might impose 
under the law those held responsible can be forced to compensate 
for business losses 
strikes at other coal mines in the vorkuta region collapsed 
thursday when management took the issue to court 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev warned thursday that 
strong administrative measures through the prosecutor and the 
courts could be taken to end the strike and promote stability 
soviet officials have expressed worry there will be shortages of 
coal for producing fuel and electricity this winter because of this 
years series of walkouts 
the regions coal production is only about half of its targeted 
level tass said it said the region is 55000 tons behind for 
october

more than 2000 people led by roman 
catholic leader jozef glemp prayed saturday at a funeral mass for 
thousands of prisoners secretly executed in the stalinist era and 
buried in unmarked graves throughout poland 
after more than 40 years it was believed to be the first public 
funeral for the untold numbers executed during the early years of 
the communist takeover in poland 
the crimes were long cloaked in silence with families fearful 
to even speak about the victims 
a changed official attitude however was underscored at 
saturdays ceremony by the presence by two ministers from the new 
government led by noncommunist solidarity members 
also attending were widows and children of victims and former 
stalinistera prisoners no officials from the communist party were 
seen 
historian wojciech ziembinski speaking during a symbolic burial 
ceremony after the mass referred to the victims as those who 
made the sacrifice of their life in the service of their homeland 
the victims included officers of the home army the main 
underground resistance force during the wartime nazi occupation 
and other suspected opponents of the communist takeover 
in his sermon cardinal glemp wearing violet funeral vestments 
condemned the terrifying evil that raged unmindful of any 
violation of morality capable of the utmost contempt of humanity 
the roman catholic primate of poland called for full disclosure 
of stalinist crimes 
the ceremony was held at the 750yearold parish of st 
catherines on the southern edge of warsaw just a few hundred 
yards from walbrzyska street cemetery many of the warsaw victims 
are said to have been secretly buried there at night during the 
late 1940s and early 1950s 
former underground army fighters and members of the recently 
legalized union of former prisoners from the stalinist time formed 
an honor guard inside the packed church much of the crowd spilled 
over into the yard outside 
after mass an urn filled with earth from the walbrzyska 
cemetery and three other suspected burial sites was laid in a small 
stonelined grave next to the church steps 
among those watching was bernart jozef of warsaw who served as 
an officer in the us army during world war ii after the 
occupation of poland 
for that reason he was sentenced by the newly installed 
communist regime to 10 years in prison as an american spy when he 
returned to poland he said he was sent to mokotowski prison now 
notorious for its brutality to political prisoners 
they would come in the night and take people out of their 
cells he said no one ever heard from them again

efforts to curb money laundering in 
the western hemisphere have pushed drug traffickers to scour the 
globe for banking havens for their illicit profits bankers and 
economists said saturday 
countries whose economies thrive due to banking secrecy laws may 
want to join the war on drugs but few are willing to clean up 
other blackmarket activities said r thomas naylor an economist 
at mcgill university in montreal 
drug money is mixed with money from arms trafficking 
smuggling insider trading and the looting of underdeveloped 
countries naylor told bankers lawyers and law enforcement 
officials from the united states and colombia at the conference on 
money laundering being held in this miami suburb 
the indian ocean seems to be the new frontier naylor said 
the seychelles and mauritania are getting into the offshore and 
instantcorporation game and dope dealers are moving in under 
the cover of that 
in his keynote speech friday attorney general dick thornburgh 
said us laws making money laundering a crime requiring banks and 
corporations to report large cash transactions and treaties 
allowing authorities to exchange information across borders have 
immeasurably helped efforts to seize the profits of the drug 
cartels 
nevertheless drug traffickers are diabolically innovative 
at hiding their money thornburgh said they will employ any 
financial instrument as a cleanser 
many academics lawyers and bankers said they were even more 
pessimistic 
curtailing money laundering will never be as successful as 
interdicting the flow of drugs because it isnt feasible to 
restrict international financial markets said economist peter 
reuter of the rand corp a think tank 
the us seized about 90 metric tons of cocaine last year about 
onefourth the estimated 360 to 450 tons that reached us users 
in contrast the more than 6 million cashtransaction reports 
submitted so far this year have uncovered only several dozen 
laundering leads reuter said 
these are hardcore desparadoes to think that additional 
money laundering controls in the banking system will exert a 
chilling effect is simply unrealistic said steven wisotsky a 
law professor at nova university in fort lauderdale 
wisotsky advocated cutting the drug enforcement budget and 
putting more taxpayer money into social programs 
that comment drew an angry reaction from tom cash head of the 
us drug enforcement administrations miami office who pointed to 
the conference as evidence of the international cooperation needed 
to fight drug trafficking 
ten years ago no such thing as money laundering was a 
crime he said later now you no longer see one to two million 
dollars in loads of cash going into banks 
but ethan nadelmann a politicalscience professor at princeton 
university who endorses legalizing drugs said the government was 
misdirecting its resources 
the current drug policy is a social moral economic and 
political disaster nadelmann said we should treat it as a 
public health issue lets stop screwing around and thinking we can 
win this war

former president ronald reagan said saturday 
that americans may lose patience with what they consider unfair 
japanese trade barriers and he urged creation of a pacific free 
trade zone 
the remarks on reagans last day of a nineday visit were in 
contrast to earlier speeches made during the trip in which he 
glossed over trade disputes 
reagan and his wife nancy left this western port city at 4 
pm for the united states with about 230 kin of us military 
personnel stationed in japan aboard their chartered boeing 747 
the plane arrived in los angeles at about 1 pm edt said 
reagan spokesman mike busch he said the former president and his 
wife made no remarks at the airport but went directly to their 
limousine for a ride to their belair home 
before their departure reagan told a gathering of 420 prominent 
businessmen that many americans do not feel their products have 
fair access to japanese markets 
fairness is a very strong strain in the american people he 
said recalling the unfairness that provoked the boston tea party 
in 1773 leading up to the american revolution 
we dont want a japanese tea party he said 
japan posted a 52 billion trade surplus with the united states 
in 1988 according to us figures 
even more damaging than actual trade barriers he said is a 
communications gap in which americans think japan is a nation of 
trade barriers 
in turn the japanese think america is a nation that makes 
products that nobody wants to buy 
until trade barriers of any kind are lowered the focus in the 
us is not going to be on whether american companies have the 
quality products japanese consumers want to buy but that the 
japanese system wont let the japanese consumers buy them reagan 
said 
reagan referred to a newsweek poll that showed 68 percent of 
americans surveyed believe japans economic power is a greater 
threat to the us future than soviet military might but he said 
few americans realize trade barriers account for no more than 20 
percent of the trade deficit and even fewer are aware of us trade 
barriers 
reagan urged both countries to overcome their disagreements on 
trade put this stepbystep bickering were going through behind 
us and embrace a trade vision that is encompassing 
his dream reagan said was of a free trade arrangement similar 
to the north american trade zone the united states and canada have 
agreed to establish that agreement will eliminate trade barriers 
between the two nations over the next decade 
we are the two greatest economic powers in the world reagan 
said let us leap beyond our nowin squabbling by undertaking a 
breathtaking plan a free trade zone between the us and 
japan 
the reagans arrived in japan on oct 20 as guests of the 
japanese government and fujisankei communications group japans 
largest media organization the hosts spent 7 million on the visit 
there have been reports that fujisankei paid reagan 2 million 
for his appearances on television and at charitable events reagan 
and the company refused comment on the reports 
fujisankeis media outlets are known to favor conservative 
nationalistic views and company chairman nobutaka shikanai has 
been a strong supporter of reagan company officials have said they 
viewed his visit as an opportunity to improve japans ties with the 
united states

this sunblessed land struts to the name of 
the golden state a reallife shangrila of precious resources 
opportunity space bounty beauty and unabashed individualism 
but paradise has a trap door 
below its surface are plates of earth that slip and slide past 
each other with enough occasional fury to move mountains flatten 
freeways and put lives and lifestyles in peril 
the oct 17 quake jolted the fickle existence of northern 
californians who inhabit a world so ideal that mark twain called it 
life on the half shell 
california has always represented the dream of a better life 
more sunshine more space a perfect home but its also the center 
of tragedy fires earthquakes mudslides all kinds of 
disasters said kevin starr a san francisco historian and a 
fourthgeneration californian 
to be a californian now is not to be an escapist but its to 
be a highrisk person 
san francisco was named the nations secondmost livable city by 
randmcnally just a week after it got its most potent jolt since 
1906 it is synonymous with earthquakes the way johnstown pa is 
with floods 
its another stereotype but californians endure them the same 
way they endure easterners and rain as a nuisance 
blissful california is the land of the laidback tofu 
selfawareness yoga hedonism narcissism wheat grass juice 
kooks nutballs and weird religions 
the rest of the country thinks we all sit around in hot tubs 
with glasses of white wine and grow organic gardens and we do but 
so what said steve gross a waiter at coffee rons 
a waitress there swears her friend sprained his wrist while 
skateboarding in an earthquake fissure 
there was no underestimating the tragedy of the earthquake it 
killed 64 people it sent 3300 to hospitals and forced nearly 
14000 from their homes 
earthquakes are something we live with here said real 
estate agent jean sinel of albany 
and quake response in california was well uniquely californian 
nancys quiches of menlo park donated 20000 quiches to the 
relief effort someone else gave hibachis for cooking the national 
holistic institute sent 200 massage therapists to knead the aching 
stressed muscles of rescue workers 
hanson industries a british company that makes hot tubs sent a 
1 million check to the red cross to help victims of the earthquake 
and hurricane hugo 
costa rican president oscar arias donated 2500 pounds of coffee 
beans to relief agencies in los gatos santa cruz watsonville and 
hollister 
a city porn shop offered an earthquake special of vibrating 
sex toys 
the quake interrupted baseballs premier event the world 
series pitting the crossbay rival oakland athletics against the 
san francisco giants sports prowess is another part of the elan of 
the bay area also home to the super bowl champion 49ers 
one entrepreneur stuck with stacks of battle of the bay 
tshirts printed a giant r over the b and came up with rattle of 
the bay another shirt read i went to candlestick park for the 
world series and all i got was this lousy earthquake a bumper 
sticker read stop continental drift 
the temblor was centered 56 miles south of the city under a 
remote peak of loma prieta or dark hill in the santa cruz 
mountains it registered 71 on the richter scale but didnt reach 
the force of the big one a quake of apocalyptic proportions that 
experts warn is coming 
smug californians called this one the pretty big one 
an earthquake simulator one of the hottest attractions on the 
universal studios hollywood tour suspended operations for 48 hours 
after the quake as a sympathy gesture the big one is set in a 
san francisco transit station 
we equated closing it down to flying the flag at half staff 
said spokeswoman joan bullard it is the studios most popular 
attraction 
the quake knocked out bridges and freeways forcing record use 
of public transit no easy trick for californians who are so 
wedded to their cars that a hearse driver once tried in vain to 
claim the body in his coffin as a passenger so he could use the car 
pool lane 
this is going to be a lifestyle change for us said rod 
diridon chairman of the metropolitan transportation commission 
some motorists used ferries that normally carry tourists to 
alcatraz and angel island on monday gale force winds created 
enough waves to cause seasickness 
ive just been through hell but heck i have to admit i made 
it through said an ashenfaced john trowbridge 27 of alameda 
the san francisco examiner had this to say about lifestyles 
people began to talk of lifestyle changes as if the earthquakes 
had suddenly come into fashion and we had nothing in our wardrobe 
that matched 
the quake smashed elegant homes in the citys marina district 
and drove the permanently homeless from the seedy tenderloin deeper 
into their shadowy world the moscone convention center was used as 
an emergency center but was cleared out to make room for a 
prescheduled meeting of plastic surgeons 
the earthquake had no priority list theres a common jolt 
that hit us all every race every class it made us all feel 
finite said the rev cecil williams of the glide memorial united 
methodist church 
this is the city where carol doda jiggled in americas first 
topless bar in 1964 where licentious hippies flourished in 
haightasbury in the tiedyed sixties and where homosexuals came 
out of the closet in the seventies 
evangelist virgi rosemond weaved those threads into the fabric 
of the quake as she preached this week through a bullhorn at 
halladie park the citys version of times square 
jesus said he would send earthquakes to godless places this 
citys wicked like sodom and gomorrah where men love men more 
than they love god she railed on behalf of the true hope 
pentecostal church of god and christ 
meanwhile the sisters of perpetual indulgence a band of gay 
men who dress in miniskirted nuns habits and fishnet stockings 
will aid earthquake victims by holding benefit dances 
were sort of icons were as much a symbol of san francisco 
as earthquakes said kenneth bunch also known as sister vicious 
when people call california kooky and weird theyre reacting to 
our wideopen freedom 
two days after the quake cynthia woods lectured reporters 
huddled near ruins in the marina and told them to write about the

luella wilson enjoyed the kind of 
retirement lifestyle most people dream about until a 
precedentsetting liability case two years ago claimed everything 
she had 
wilson 91 had paid for her house traveled south every winter 
and had more than 500000 in the bank money she often shared with 
family and friends 
i always thought money was to spend on myself and on 
others she said recently thats what i worked for 
but her generosity led to her legal woes 
wilson lent a grandnephew money to buy a car three weeks 
later after a night of drinking and using drugs he was in an 
automobile accident in which a passenger lost a leg the passenger 
successfully sued wilson saying she knew her grandnephew did not 
have a drivers license and that he used drugs and therefore was 
negligent in lending him money to buy a car 
wilson now lives like a recluse eats lunch courtesy of meals on 
wheels and owes 950000 to a young man with criminal convictions 
her one small hope is a retrial scheduled for nov 6 in 
bennington superior court last spring the vermont supreme court 
upheld the decision against wilson but also ruled that the auto 
dealer who sold the car to the grandnephew should not have been 
excluded from the case 
wilson said she feels like a victim of a legal system gone awry 
i dont know how all this ever happened to me it couldnt have 
happened 50 years ago she told the rutland herald in an 
interview last week 
wilson who did not testify in the 1987 trial because of a 
medical problem said of the retrial if i can walk ill be 
there i should have told my story to the jury last time 
according to testimony at the first trial wilsons grandnephew 
willard stuart was driving a 1981 chrysler on april 24 1984 when 
he picked up three friends stuart testified that he drank nearly a 
gallon of beer had at least one shot of whiskey and shared at 
least six marijuana cigarettes with the others 
sometime after 11 pm stuarts car went off a railroad bridge 
mark vince who was riding in the back seat was paralyzed from the 
middle of his back down and later had a leg amputated 
vince unemployed with 18 misdemeanor convictions before the 
accident had not known stuart before the night of the accident and 
did not know he had no drivers license 
vinces attorney successfully sued wilson by arguing that she 
knew stuart did not have a license and that he drank and used 
drugs after deliberating for an hour the jury agreed 
i think its just really stretching to hold a grandmother 
responsible because she either lends or gives money to a 
greatnephew to buy a car said wilsons attorney manfred ehrich 
the plaintiffs attorney rolf sternberg told the new york 
times that wilsons claims of poverty are exaggerated 
she is not destitute sternberg said the court order said 
her assets are to be frozen except for what she needs to live 
adequately somebody is trying to make it difficult to pick a fair 
and impartial jury 
sally mcvie a juror in the 1987 trial said the case had been 
difficult 
we saw and heard vince in his wheelchair and we felt terrible 
for him she said we werent told about his record and we 
were told by his lawyers that he was going to school and had 
straightened out his life 
i guess in our hearts we were afraid it could turn out like 
this but we never saw her and we didnt know if she had insurance 
or not 
when wilsons insurance company refused to pay the 950000 
judgment against her vince attached all her assets including her 
102000 home 
wilson has sued her insurance company vermont mutual 
if this ruling as allowed to stand i feel sorry for any other 
older people loaning relatives money she said theyll have to 
watch out or theyll be sued by someone they never met

a group of japaneseamericans who were denied 
their high school diplomas seven months after pearl harbor won 
recognition 47 years later in a graduation ceremony at their alma 
mater saturday 
wearing blue mortarboards and graduation gowns 11 of the 15 
former students who were snubbed in wartime assembled at los 
angeles high school to receive their diplomas which were dated 
june 26 1942 
our purpose today is to redress this very serious grievance 
that occurred in 1942 said los angeles unified school district 
spokesman dan isaac 
the ceremony included the pledge of allegiance 
graduate aiko yoshinaga said she blamed the government not her 
school for the insult 
i think the governments action was based on racism said 
mrs yoshinaga motherinlaw of current school board member warren 
furutani 
not only racism but really a lack of honesty a lack of real 
strong political leadership she added so i have warm feelings 
about the high school i went to 
the wartime graduation was held not at the high school but in 
suburban arcadia at the santa anita racetrack which had been 
converted in 1942 to a temporary holding pen for 
japaneseamericans an estimated 120000 japaneseamericans were 
taken from their west coast homes and detained in camps during the 
war 
hundreds of students received their diplomas at the racetrack 
ceremony but the 15 students from los angeles high school waited 
in vain to hear their names called 
they blame the tide of antijapanese sentiment that swept the 
nation after the attack on pearl harbor which brought the united 
states into the war the students said that sentiment was 
personified in paul webb the wartime principal at los angeles high 
webb who died in 1982 refused to issue the students diplomas 
even though the school board declared all japaneseamerican seniors 
in good standing be given diplomas 
furutani was contacted about the diplomas by another member of 
mrs yoshinagas class hayao shishino furutani had district 
employees search old school records to document shishinos claims 
it was time to set the record straight furutani said this 
week we decided it was time they have their real diplomas 
one of the original 15 has died and three others could not 
attend the ceremony shishino said 
the us house of representatives voted thursday to begin making 
12 billion in reparation payments next year to japaneseamericans 
confined to camps during world war ii the bill which would give 
20000 to each of the 60000 surviving internees now moves to the 
senate

president bush angered by daniel 
ortegas threat to resume fighting with the contras derided the 
nicaraguan president on saturday as a little man and an 
unwanted animal at a garden party 
ortega a bit more diplomatic responded that bush was just 
reacting defensively 
what triggered bushs temper was ortegas surprise announcement 
friday between meetings at the summit of western hemisphere 
leaders that he would break off the ceasefire with contra rebels 
that has been in place since march 1988 
at a news conference saturday bush mocked ortegas decision to 
wear a military uniform to a meeting of democratic leaders he 
called ortega an outcast and an unwanted animal at a garden 
party 
he said ortega had embarrassed himself in front of the 
hemispheres leaders i do know that president arias got a hold 
of him last night and spoke very directly to him said bush 
adding that two other presidents did as well 
just hours before declaring his intention to end the ceasefire 
ortega shook hands with bush at a brief encounter the nicaraguans 
eagerly released photos of the two presidents together the white 
house withheld its shots 
bush said saturday that instead of seeking a photo 
opportunity ortega should be talking to the usbacked contra 
guerrillas to his own people 
twice he referred to the 5foot10 nicaraguan as a little 
man asked why he used that description the 6foot2 bush 
snapped because he is thats why 
ortega upon returning to managua responded this is a 
totally defensive attitude on the part of president bush 
his spokeswoman maria cristina arguello quoted ortega as 
saying the tone of the bush statements was not in harmony with 
the spirit of the summit 
little man may not have been the best phrase for an american 
president to use in latin america where uncle sam is often 
portrayed as a tall blueeyed devil taking advantage of short 
brown indians 
ortega is actually tall for a central american arias their 
mutual host is closer to average at 5foot6 
arias said nothing publicly about the contretemps but his 
spokesman jorge urbina said ortega had insulted all the 
democraticlaly elected presidents of latin america and the 
caribbean 
later brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser told 
reporters aboard air force one that bush meant little man in 
the sense of small man petty 
scowcroft who stands 5foot8 added he doesnt call me a 
little man the retired air force general said ortega stepped 
on his necktie at the hemispheric gathering

opposition leaders on saturday 
denounced president daniel ortegas talk of ending a ceasefire 
with usbacked rebels amid reports that government troops were 
massing possibly for new fighting 
however the president returned home saturday from a regional 
summit saying president bush had shown interest in enlisting the 
help of other latin american presidents to change ortegas decision 
to end the 19monthold truce 
i interpret this as a predisposition of president bush amid 
all his rhetoric of negotiating this matter of the truce with the 
mediation of latin american presidents ortega said 
opposition leaders said ortegas announcement he would end the 
truce was designed to disrupt national elections that the 
government fears it will lose 
luis sanchez a spokesman for the national opposition union 
said the cancellation of the ceasefire places the electoral 
process under a state of siege he spoke to radio catolica 
nicaraguas roman catholic church radio station in a telephone 
interview from san jose costa rica where the summit was held 
he called ortegas plan a maneuver to intimidate the 
population 
ortega announced friday in costa rica that his leftist 
sandinista government will end the ceasefire with the contra 
rebels but he did not say when 
he stepped back slightly from that announcement after arriving 
in managua saturday he said his government will announce tuesday 
whether it will extend the truce with the contras for another month 
however he said he would continue observing the truce only if 
nonlethal american aid to the contras were used to disband the 
rebel force 
ortega said friday the ceasefire could not hold because of 
stepped up attacks by rebels a claim denied by contra leaders 
the drop of water that made the glass spill over was an 
attack oct 21 in which 19 soldiers died he told an audience at 
the university of costa rica 
government troops were reportedly being moved to strategic 
points in what could be preparations for new military operations 
a governmentrun radio station in central chontales province 
said saturday that more than 1000 soldiers from managua were being 
transported to guard the strategically important rama road 
the station radio catarran cited unidentified military sources 
as saying the move was because of the constant activity of the 
contras along the road 
sources in chontales said there has been heavy helicopter 
traffic in the area around juigalpa the provincial capital over 
the past few days there was speculation that government troops and 
equipment were being moved in that manner 
for 19 months the government had been extending the truce 
usually at the beginning of every month 
ortega said he had spoken with presidents carlos andres perez of 
venezuela and oscar arias of costa rica at the summit and that they 
told him they were willing to mediate between ortega and bush on 
the truce 
interviewed live by governmentrun voice of nicaragua radio 
after stepping off an airplane on his return to managua ortega 
denied reports he had stormed out of the twoday summit 
he said he left early simply to attend to matters in nicaragua 
ortega dismissed a bush comment calling him a little man 
saying this is a totally defensive attitude on the part of 
president bush 
contra leader adolfo calero said in a telephone interview in 
miami that the contras were not responsible for the oct 21 ambush 
ortega is crying wolf he said behind this ploy we can 
see that he wants to disrupt the electoral process because of 
violeta chamorros increasing popularity and support 
violeta barrios de chamorro of the coalition national opposition 
union is ortegas main challenger in the feb 25 election 
calero and bosco matamoros the chief contra chief spokesman in 
washington said rebels have neither the weapons nor manpower to 
mount offensives 
it defies any logic that 3000 men at the most could carry out 
any military operation in nicaragua matamoros said in a 
telephone interview he said most contras remained in camps in 
neighboring honduras 
matamoros accused ortega of raising the allegation to justify a 
final offensive against the contras 
barricada the newspaper of the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front said saturday that truce violations by the 
contras have left 736 people dead and 634 wounded in the past 19 
months 
also saturday an army spokesman denied the government had 
staged mock combat in northern nicaragua to keep people from 
registering to vote 
lt carlos lara an army spokesman said a patrol of army and 
interior ministry troops was ambushed friday in northern matagalpa 
province and returned fire killing six contras 
the contras denied staging any offensive inside nicaragua 
col enrique bermudez the hardline contra military leader 
said the sandinista army had been conducting a cleanup operation in 
the area against the guerrillas who have to defend themselves

david dinkins rudely interrupted in his cruise 
to city hall faced an array of television cameras a week ago and 
uttered six awful words for a politician to speak i have not 
done anything wrong 
strategically at least he had besieged by questions about a 
stock sale to his son the democratic frontrunner for mayor found 
himself forced into a complicated defense by early last week he 
had plummeted in the polls 
happily for dinkins republican nominee rudolph w giuliani did 
not pull past him after six weeks of sharply negative campaigning 
the 45yearold former federal prosecutor was illpositioned to 
grab dinkins defectors 
still the mayoral race with the outcome once seemingly set in 
stone is suddenly uncertain with just 1 weeks to go the duel to 
lead the nations most populous city is startlingly uncertain and 
increasingly contentious 
its one of the great races of guys running backwards that 
ive ever seen said david garth political adviser to mayor 
edward i koch whom dinkins upended in the democratic primary 
sept 12 
giuliani hurt himself very badly in a series of early 
missteps that raised charges of racial insensitivity said garth 
and dinkins problem is definitely dinkins the question is 
whos going to lose it first 
the new york times endorsed dinkins in sundays editions saying 
he is more experienced in city government than giuliani and could 
help ease racial tensions in the city but the times editorial 
bemoaned what it called a sorry campaign 
neither man has demonstrated compelling qualifications for the 
job ed koch has filled for half a generation the newspaper said 
in a city that has five registered democrats for every 
republican dinkins the 62yearold manhattan borough president 
has a builtin edge in his quest to become new yorks first black 
mayor he enjoys the support of most unions whose field work in 
turning out voters can be invaluable on election day 
but dinkins is wounded his lead perhaps cut in half from the 
20point cushion he had enjoyed all fall one reason is his 
struggle to explain why he sold his son stock in a privately held 
communications company for 58000 when less than three years 
before he listed its worth as 1 million 
dinkins said the higher sum was an overstatement and he produced 
documents supporting the lower price giuliani suggested dinkins 
undervalued the stock to avoid gift taxes and accused him of 
knowingly and intentionally breaking the ethics law the 
republican used the issue to remind voters of dinkins failure to 
file tax returns from 1969 to 1972 
despite the comfortable margin in the polls dinkins has been on 
the defensive since primary night when he let his friend jesse 
jackson address a victory party a tactical error analysts say 
because jacksons support of palestinian rights and his onetime 
reference to new york as hymietown have made him anathema to 
some jewish voters 
while dinkins himself has a strong proisrael record his 
troubles were compounded by charges that one of his advisers made 
antisemitic remarks years ago and that his campaign paid 9500 
for work by a black nationalist who is a convicted kidnapper 
some strategists think dinkins would not have held a 20point 
lead in any case the mans a black candidate thats an inherent 
liability in some communities said norman adler political 
adviser to the teamsters union which backs dinkins 
dinkins one salvation has been giulianis own woes critics 
suggested giuliani was playing to racial and ethnic divisions when 
he placed an ad in a yiddish newspaper showing himself with 
president bush and dinkins with jackson let the people of new 
york choose their own destiny it said 
then there was the jackie mason flap the comedian serving as 
giulianis emissary to jewish voters created a furor by suggesting 
that jews favored dinkins out of guilt and by calling dinkins a 
fancy shvartze with a mustache shvartze is a derogatory 
yiddish term for blacks 
for all their differences in image the candidates share 
positions on many issues in separate appearances before a group of 
rabbis last week they made strikingly similar points calling for 
more police patrols more housing for the homeless better drug 
education and treatment on demand for addicts 
there are substantive differences dinkins has suggested a 1 
percent nearly acrosstheboard budget cut to handle a looming 
deficit crisis while giuliani wants more selective cuts giuliani 
backs building a trash incinerator in brooklyn dinkins wants more 
study 
if the race is dinkins to lose political analysts said 
another misstep could be fatal 
david dinkins is like the stock market right now said 
adler he took a long fall he leveled off and bounced up a 
little and he may or may not fall more depending on what comes 
up

catholics and protestants took two 
peace trains saturday to protest an ira bombing campaign 
against the dublinbelfast rail link but a bomb threat stopped one 
of the trains 
the irish republican army which has disrupted service on the 
rail line more than 60 times in the past year with bombs and bomb 
threats had promised to let the day pass peacefully 
people right across the community are making a point and the 
point is this that this railway link between north and south must 
be kept open it is vital to our island said bishop samuel 
poyntz of the protestant church of ireland he saw the train riders 
off in belfast the capital of the british province of northern 
ireland 
roman catholic bishop cahal daly of northern ireland was also at 
the station as the trains left for dublin each with about 400 
riders aboard hundreds more were turned away for lack of seats 
this is a message the ira cannot refuse to hear because it is 
coming from working and middleclass people young and old who are 
not going to allow communication in this island to be stopped 
daly said 
the two trains went to dublin capital of the republic of 
ireland and back to belfast without incident 
however when one of them set off again from belfast with new 
passengers later saturday it was halted before reaching the border 
because of an anonymous telephone warning of a bomb on the line on 
the republic side 
inspector terence brady of the republics police whose force 
received and relayed the warning said it could not investigate 
until daylight 
the 70 people aboard including irish republic legislators 
decided to stay on the train through the night at portadown 25 
miles southwest of belfast and about 90 miles north of dublin 
in a statement reported friday by press association britains 
domestic news agency the mainly catholic ira said it would 
resume occasional attacks when we see fit 
these attacks are not aimed at closing it down but to force 
british soldiers into painstaking and dangerous operations said 
the statement 
the ira is fighting to unite the protestantdominated british 
province with the republic of ireland which is predominantly 
catholic 
no one has been killed or seriously injured in the campaign 
against the railroad line and the major impact has been to depress 
business on what until recently was the only public transport 
link between the two capitals 
the rail line now has competition from a daily bus service 
when the two special trains pulled into dublins connolly 
station they were greeted by irelands post office workers union 
band playing congratulations 
the only protest came at the border station of newry where 
supporters of sinn fein the iras legal political wing carried 
banners calling for british withdrawal from northern ireland 
the peace train concept has brought together people of 
different political opinions from all walks of life north and 
south said proinsias de rossa a passenger on the train and 
leader of the workers party which broke away from sinn fein and 
the ira 20 years ago 
i am sure the vast majority would also be prepared to support 
a more general demand for peace and an end to the killing and 
destruction said de rossa whose group has rejected armed 
struggle as a means of uniting the two irelands

the seattle group which including neonazi skinheads and 
counterculture types of various stripes cheered wildly and 
profanely as two small piles of flags were set afire outside the 
post office 
they sang the national anthem as a flag was lowered down a pole 
outside the post office soaked with lighter fluid then set alight 
and raised back into the night sky 
the handful of organizers from vietnam veterans against the war 
antiimperialist said there were 1000 flags one large and most 
of the rest the size of a large postage stamp in two metal pans 
placed on the sidewalk outside the post office 
people in the crowd also produced a flag that was held aloft and 
torched as the national anthem was sung 
loud cheers went up when a flag from a mcdonalds restaurant was 
produced for burning it melted but would not burst into flame 
after the demonstration protesters milled up and down the 
street in seattles capital hill section they blocked traffic and 
occasional fights with clubs and bottles broke out but no serious 
injuries were reported 
several people some apparently drunk argued the pros and cons 
of flagburning and ripped at least one flag to shreds as they 
fought over it 
no uniformed police were seen in the vicinity although police 
spokesman hal kulgren had said friday there would be arrests if a 
law was broken 
members of the veterans group had said they would have american 
civil liberties union and national lawyers guild lawyers at the 
scene as observers however it was not apparent such observers 
were present 
kathleen taylor aclu director in seattle said the law 
encourages the very action its intended to discourage 
there were no incidents of public flag burning in seattle 
until congress enacted the prohibition she said liberty needs

beer and soft drink cans died thursday at the age of 76 
fraze died of a brain tumor at kettering memorial hospital in 
dayton the hospital said

the inspiration came one night when fraze couldnt sleep he got 
up at 130 am to work on a way to attach an opening lever to a 
can 
i was up all night and it came to me just like that he 
said later i knew how to do it so it would be commercially 
feasible

a letter he wrote from his hospital bed saying how much he would 
miss his wife who gave birth to their first child shortly before 
she died 
my life will be empty without you stuart wrote now 
youre taken away from me i will never know the feeling of your 
hand in mine

suburb north of boston after a funeral mass that packed st james 
of the fellsway church in nearby medford with about 300 mourners

raymond flynn and cardinal bernard law 
the stuarts were leaving brigham and womens hospital in boston

president bush on saturday condemned 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega for a shameful decision to 
end a lengthy ceasefire with the contras and hinted at renewing 
arms for the rebels even as he urged them to avoid military 
aggression 
ortega who shattered the tranquility of a twoday hemispheric 
celebration of democracy with his military plans later 
softened his stand and said he would decide tuesday whether to 
extend the ceasefire 
he accused the contras of mounting waves of attacks inside 
nicaragua 
the two leaders clashed at rival news conferences that upstaged 
the ending to the twoday conference and the most personal 
language by far came from bush 
the president belittled the leftist nicaraguan leader as this 
little man showing up in his military uniform at a democracy 
meeting and said ortega looks like that unwanted animal at a 
garden party 
a spokesman for costa ricas president oscar arias host of the 
gathering said ortega had dashed cold water on the party since 
he was invited to a party for democracy and should have behaved 
properly 
nothing like this has ever been seen before said jorge 
urbina 
at the united nations general secretary javier perez de cuellar 
said he was extremely concerned about the recent clashes 
between the contras and the sandinista forces and the apparent 
breakdown of the ceasefire 
he expressed his strong wish that both sides exercise 
restraint so that the peace process may continue 
in nicaragua government troops were reportedly being moved to 
strategic points in what could be preparations for new military 
operations 
governmentrun radio catarran in central chontales province said 
more than 1000 soldiers from managua were being transported to 
guard the strategically important rama road after rebel activity in 
the area 
the final act of the twoday summit dedication of an outdoor 
democracy plaza in the costa rican capital was played out 
without ortega who left for home early 
school children carrying the flags of the nations represented 
made up more than half of the crowd which did not quite fill the 
square bush watched the ceremony from behind a thick transparent 
bulletproof shield that had been installed by the secret service 
before departing ortega underscored his intention to break the 
19monthold ceasefire between forces of his leftist sandinista 
government and the contra guerrillas 
but after arriving back in managua he told reporters he would 
announce on tuesday whether the truce would be extended for another 
month as it has almost monthly since march 1988 
ortega said arias and carlos andres perez president of 
venezuela had offered to mediate any discussions between the 
united states and the sandinistas 
the waves of attacks by the counterrevolutionaries have 
increased enormously in the last few weeks the objective is the 
destruction of the electoral process in nicaragua said ortega 
who is running for reelection in feb 25 elections 
he said he would continue observing the truce only if nonlethal 
american aid currently going to the contras were used instead to 
demobilize the rebels bush said he had encouraged the contras 
not to take aggressive military action and we would certainly 
continue to do that 
in comments after speaking to the costa rican journalists 
association perez pledged to work to make sure that ortegas 
decision is not carried out he said he thought the conflict 
could still be mediated and that he arias and other latin american 
leaders would be able to help 
after an early morning tennis game with argentine president 
carlos saul menem bush met privately with nicaraguan opposition 
presidential candidate violeta chamorro and panamanian opposition 
leader guillermo endara as well as a group of costa rican political 
figures 
he emerged afterwards to tell a news conference that several of 
the leaders at the conference have told ortega it would be sheer 
folly to resume hostilities 
he ortega knows that if theres an allput military 
offensive thats going to change the equation 180 degrees bush 
said 
asked if that meant he would seek more military aid for the 
contras bush said well let you know well let you know 
he also said i dont think the contras ought to attack what 
we ought to do is fulfill the agreements forged by arias 
he added we have encouraged the contras not to take 
aggressive military action and we would certainly continue to do 
that 
under arias plan ortega had agreed to hold free elections in 
nicaragua in february and the united states had withheld military 
aid to the contras 
faced with resistance from congress for providing more arms for 
the contras bush reversed eight years of president ronald reagans 
policy by endorsing a diplomatic rather than a military solution to 
the nicaraguan conflict 
bush en route back to washington aboard air force one told 
reporters it was a great visit asked about the tone of his 
criticisms of ortega bush said only speaks for itself 
an administration official who asked not to be identified said 
ortegas move may be intended to give the sandinistas an excuse 
to tighten up internally and to have troops out to intimidate 
people before the february elections 
at his news conference bush blistered ortega with unrelenting 
criticism sarcasm and insults 
professing bewilderment at ortegas decision bush said i 
cant figure it out ive asked our own folks what in heavens 
name would make a person do something so counterproductive stick 
him out like a sore thumb amongst a bunch of democraticallyelected 
leaders offend a host costa rican president oscar arias 
referring to his handshake with ortega on friday bush said 
hes always kind of sidling up to me looking for some photo op 
what he ought to do is talk to the nicaraguan resistance 
bush called ortegas action a shameful blow to democracy 
warning ortega not to backtrack from presidential elections on 
feb 25 bush said the people of this hemisphere know the 
difference between real elections and sham elections and the 
hemisphere will not settle for anything less than free and fair 
elections 
bush also took aim at panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
saying he represented an outlaw regime that simply must be 
replaced 
the president said noriega may think his lead pipe politics 
have won but hes won nothing more than a fragile status quo and 
democracy really will triumph in panama im confident of that

federal investigators believe a flaw developed 
in the manufacture of an engine part of united airlines flight 232 
caused the planes midair explosion over iowa in july according 
to a published report 
the dc10 jet which lost its hydraulic flight controls july 19 
in the breakup of its tailmounted engine crashed in flames in an 
attempted landing at sioux city that killed 112 of the 296 people 
on board 
a federal hearing on tuesday will focus on whether the problem 
in the engines fan disk should have been detected before the 
crash the washington post reported in its sunday editions 
the federal aviation administration last month ordered 
metallurgical tests on the engine disks of other aircraft that were 
made in the same manufacturing process 
officials for the national transportation safety board which is 
investigating the crash could not be reached for comment late 
saturday 
investigators discovered a crack in the engines fan disk which 
they found in an iowa cornfield earlier this month which they have 
suspected led to the explosion and loss of the planes hydraulic 
system 
the origin of the crack appears to be the thing that started 
the whole sequence of events anthony j broderick faa acting 
executive director for regulatory standards and compliance told 
the post 
broderick also said detailed inspections of the disk from the 
flight indicate the crack began with an internal flaw caused by the 
double melting process used to make the titanium in the disk 19 
years ago 
further tests have been ordered by the government are expected 
to be completed no sooner than february

rescue workers saturday recovered the 
bodies of six more victims of the explosion at the phillips 
petroleum co plastics plant raising the death toll to at least 
the 13 officials said 
the search for nine other workers missing since mondays 
explosions continued around the clock 
the search has been stymied by debris up to 40 feet high near 
the control and finishing room where its expected the missing 
workers will be found said company spokesman rob phillips 
the blasts injured 124 people 
until saturday seven bodies had been recovered five bodies 
were found early saturday and the sixth was found during the 
afternoon said phillips spokesman rob phillips 
only four of the dead have been positively identified said jere 
smith another phillips spokesman identification has been slow 
because the victims were burned beyond recognition forcing medical 
examiners to use dental records 
two of the dead that have been identified are phillips employees 
james h campbell 30 of baytown and jeffrey l harrison 36 of 
houston said sheryl tumis of the harris county medical examiners

and demolition workers were at the plant on a 24hour basis rob 
phillips said 
the factory accounts for nearly 20 percent of the nations 
production of plastic pellets used in the manufacture of milk jugs 
and grocery bags 
the company believes flammable hydrocarbon vapor from ethylene 
and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical reactor 
triggering the blasts but phillips officials have said they dont 
know how the gases were ignited 
the company city officials and the employees union have 
organized a memorial service monday evening for the dead and 
missing workers 
phillips has established a memorial fund to aid the families of

now that the dust has settled the rubble 
remains 
it ranges from 1 miles of collapsed interstate 880 to the 
kindlingsized splinters of destroyed houses around the bay area 
disposing of the mess will be a major problem for months after 
the oct 17 earthquake and already garbage bins are as ubiquitous 
as espresso machines 
no formal accounting has been made although it is unlikely to 
approach the 11 million cubic yards produced by 28000 destroyed 
buildings in 1906 
in a tragic irony much of that rubble was pushed into san 
francisco bay and covered with sand to form the foundation of the 
posh marina district in the latest quake the landfill turned to 
jelly amplifying the shaking and destroying 60 buildings the 
quake also uncovered a brick and a piece of concrete from the 1906 
rubble 
it is a cycle that may be repeated this time although not with 
homes officials say the biggest piece of rubble the interstate 
880 viaduct may be ground up and used as landfill in oakland 
that frustrates quake experts who for years have warned against 
such practices with little result in the landhungry bay area 
we know and have said for a long time that landfill is a 
more risky place to build and this earthquake confirms that said 
andrew pitt a scientist for the us geological survey in menlo 
park 
landfills ordinarily appear solid but under earthquake 
shaking they essentially liquefy and offer the ground above no 
support and you have a major failure pitt said 
despite the lessons of history building on landfill continues 
san francisco voters go to the polls nov 7 to decide whether to 
build a new baseball stadium the proposed site is on landfill 
land is so expensive and devastating earthquakes so far apart 
that people are encouraged to take their chances said pat 
jorgenson of the usgs after all it was 83 years between 
devastating quakes in san francisco every generation figures it 
wont happen in my lifetime 
if the ground is properly compacted and clay is added and if 
expensive techniques are used it can be safe to build on landfill 
she said but many of the buildings destroyed in the quake were not 
built with modern techniques 
in a briefing last week the usgs said many of the problems had 
been known about before the 71 magnitude quake the greatest 
loss of life and damage to property during the loma prieta 
earthquake occurred in areas where geologic hazards had been 
clearly identified and mapped as early as 15 years ago 
the outer perimeter of san francisco including the 
highrisestudded financial district was built as landfill claimed 
the bay it is a constant source of worry that the anticipated big 
one will liquefy the ground and topple the buildings 
the pattern of damage in the latest quake suggests that could 
happen 
i880 whose collapse killed dozens was built on landfill 
so was the heavily damaged embarcadero freeway which will be 
closed three months so was candlestick park which suffered slight 
damage 
the main runway of the oakland airport is on landfill and 3000 
feet of it sank so did the busy seventh street terminal at the 
port of oakland which handles 7 percent of the freight at the 
nations fourthbusiest port it was resting on landfill 
in other parts of the earthquake zone the problem wasnt 
landfill but ancient streams that have been built over but produce 
the same earthquake result as landfill 
in los gatos where 30 buildings collapsed the town was built 
on old stream deposits that had gathered in a wet geologic bowl 
when the land gave way so did the buildings the story was the same 
in watsonville where 195 buildings and 106 mobile homes were 
destroyed and 235 suffered major damage 
the heavily damaged pacific garden mall in santa cruz lies on 
stream deposits that also liquefied in the 1906 quake 
despite its landfillrelated damage oakland has requested the 
rubble from i880 to shore up quakedamaged areas said port 
spokesman mel wax theyd have to crush it and remove the steel 
so all that was left was aggregate which can be mixed to form 
cement he said 
as long as you dont have an earthquake its quite good 
the groundup freeway would be stored on seven acres at the 
airport and used as needed he said 
the freeway rubble weighs about 40000 tons said jim drago of 
the california department of transportation which owns the mess 
department officials say the contractors chosen soon to remove 
the debris will decide who gets the rubble 
another alternative causing controversy is a proposal to place 
the rubble onto barges and dump it 42 miles out to sea at a navy 
dump site where it would serve as fish habitat 
environmentalists and us rep tony lantos dcalif oppose 
the proposal saying the rubble could hurt fishing 
while government agencies will foot the bill to remove public 
structures homeowners have to pay for their own demolition and 
removal 
most of the hundreds of destroyed homes will be buried in the 
zanker road resource and recovery inc landfill near san jose a 
bayside garbage and recycling facility that will never be overbuilt 
with homes said site engineer mike gross 
for the next two months the company expects 1500 cubic yards 
of quakerelated debris a day and has added 10 workers to handle 
the load it costs 530 to 850 per cubic yard to bury debris at 
the landfill he said 
we currently recycle 33 percent of incoming material and that 
should increase to 40 to 45 percent he said most valuable items 
include old bricks wood metals concrete and dirt 
in watsonville contractors are eager to recover construction 
materials said city clerk lorraine washington weve had a 
number of contractors call and volunteer to bring dump trucks in 
they are chomping at the bit to get more brick 
demolition of downtown businesses worth 200 million is to begin 
monday mrs washington said the federal government will pay to 
remove buildings considered a public danger but owners are 
responsible otherwise 
in san francisco which has 250 buildings considered unsafe two 
garbage operators have offered to go through the rubble of 
destroyed homes as they dispose of the structures at the zanker 
landfill said michele pla of the department of public works 
they clearly are looking for irreplaceable items which will 
be returned to owners she said

three hundred departing jobs might not mean much 
in a metropolitan work force of 3 million but when the company 
exiting with them is oil giant exxon corp it sends a profound 
message about new yorks eroding reputation as the national 
frontoffice capital 
exxon the worlds largest oil company and thirdlargest 
american industrial concern after general motors corp and ford 
motor co announced the impending closure of its 107year home 
base in new york this past week 
the company is moving the headquarters to the dallasfort worth 
area where it will save on rent taxes building costs and 
employee commuting time 
how much it will save remains unclear but the gleaming 54story 
building the company has occupied in midtown manhattan rents for 
about 50 a square foot vs about 10 for the temporary space 
exxon will move into until a new headquarters is constructed on a 
former ranch in a dallas suburb 
of course the departure isnt like gm or ford shutting down a 
factory in a onefactory town it is likely that new tenants will 
replace exxon and the outside world will barely notice much of the 
buildings space was occupied by other tenants already 
new york officials surprised and annoyed by exxons 
announcement quickly emphasized what they called the citys 
strength in retaining businesses despite the highprofile 
departures of other corporate giants in recent years ranging from 
retailer jc penney amp co to trans world airlines 
although exxon is certainly a major company in new york in 
the country and the world the practical matter is they employed 
300 people here said stanley grayson deputy mayor for finance 
and economic development 
but others said it wasnt the 300 jobs that new york should 
worry about instead they emphasized the symbolic meaning of 
exxons departure in a city where symbolism is a crucial element of 
attracting business in the first place 
new york is very much dependent on its image said samuel 
ehrenhalt regional administrator for the bureau of labor 
statistics and an authority on the new york areas economy 
if everybody else is here this is the place to be he said 
if this is the place of action then people will be here new 
york is based on the people that make it creative and exciting 
that reflects its key role as a national and international 
financial and business service center 
more than 100 leading american corporations make their home in 
new york more than any other single us city in addition 
thousands of other companies have important new york office 
operations 
but bureau of labor statistics figures show that employment in 
new yorks corporate administrativeoffice category has fallen from 
54000 jobs 10 years ago to about 29000 now 
the significance of these numbers goes beyond simple arithmetic 
thousands of other jobs from advertising executives to janitors to 
restaurateurs are directly dependent on the frontoffice segment 
of new yorks economy 
in addition the departure of bigname companies like exxon is 
coming at a time when the northeasts economy is softening this 
makes it less likely for example that major trade organizations 
will book conventions in new york opting instead for cheaper areas 
or meetings close to home 
to a large extent the departure of exxon reflects the 
technological leaps made during the 1980s enabling corporations to 
do business by telephone computer networks and facsimile machines 
that means they can be headquartered practically anywhere theres a 
phone and an electrical outlet 
i think what we see here is a picture of increasing 
vulnerability as a result of stiffening competitive pressures and 
improvements that permits relocation of companies historically 
based in the city ehrenhalt said it means the city must look 
to shore up its competitive strengths 
in other business and economic news this past week 
wall street spoke with two voices on a computerized form of 
stock trading that critics blame for roiling the market several 
key brokerages said they would restrict use of one type of 
socalled program trading because an investor outcry but the new 
york stock exchange began trading in a new product called a stock 
basket that makes program trading much easier 
prospects of a debtfinanced takeover for ual corp grew more 
distant reflecting an increased resistance to the use of 
highyield junk bonds to bankroll corporate acquisitions 
directors of the parent of united airlines said they wanted to keep 
the company independent 
the big three automakers reported sharply lower thirdquarter 
earnings due the high cost of summertime incentives aimed at 
peddling more vehicles at the same time a takeover battle 
appeared to be emerging between general motors corp and ford motor 
co for britains luxury carmaker jaguar 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said the central bank 
could erase inflation with painful shortterm policies but he 
evidently wasnt including beer drinkers in his analysis they 
could benefit from lower inflation without pain due to aggressive 
pricecutting plans announced by anheuser busch cos which were 
part of an industrywide price war

corporate profits often relegated to a 
subordinate role in recent years have staged a strong comeback as 
a driving force in the stock market 
but unhappily for investors who like their news upbeat the 
earnings news that has been capturing most of the attention has 
been negative 
and as wall street looks ahead to 1990 uneasy talk is starting 
to revive of a recession or at least a bumpy landing for the 
economy 
a steady drumbeat of disappointing earnings reports lent a 
dolorous tone to financial markets last week said economists at 
merrill lynch in their weekend appraisal of the financial outlook 
unfortunately more of the same is likely in the period ahead 
many optimists on wall street have long been counting on the 
federal reserve to stave off any impending slump by relaxing its 
credit policy and setting up a soft landing for businesses 
consumers and the markets 
indeed the fed seemed to carry out just such a mission adroitly 
during the summer when a recession scare hit the street many 
observers now think circumstances will soon prompt the fed to ease 
again 
but some wonder whether the central bank can keep succeeding in 
its finetuning efforts to restrain inflation without putting 
businesses through a period of pain 
the fed may have waited too long say the economists s jay 
levy and david a levy in the new edition of their newsletter 
industry forecast the expansion is looking sicker almost every 
day 
a recession in the coming nine months while not a certainty 
is now more probable than not the united states economy may 
already have passed the business cycle peak 
government data issued thursday seemed to suggest growth still 
was slogging along at a slowtomoderate clip preliminary figures 
for the third quarter showed the gross national product expanding 
at a 25 percent annual rate after adjustment for inflation 
matching the pace set in the second quarter 
but a lot of the thirdquarter strength was concentrated in 
consumer spending especially for cars that many analysts consider 
unlikely to persist 
on wall street many traders view of consumer stocks already 
has been soured by signs of intensified price competition in 
businesses ranging from fastfood restaurants to beer 
the stock market fell steadily all through the past week 
leaving the dow jones average of 30 industrials with a loss of 
9242 points at 259672 wiping out most of the previous weeks 
11988 gain 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 652 to 
18560 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
fell 1830 to 45233 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 1256 at 37001 
volume on the big board averaged 17501 million shares a day 
against 23404 million the week before 
whatever weakness in corporate profits might mean to the stock 
market many analysts believe it will soon be a plus for higher 
government bond prices and lower interest rates 
the recent inflation news has been better than expected they 
note giving the fed more apparent maneuvering room to pursue a 
stimulative credit policy 
inflation has been beaten for the moment contends john 
connolly at dean witter reynolds inc we believe that 
fourthquarter growth will be the slowest of the year 
the fed will soon conclude that the major danger is economic 
weakness not strength

the bush administrations savings and loan 
bailout plan has passed a crucial test with better marks than 
expected 
the introductory sale last week of 30year bonds used to raise 
money for rescuing the nations sickly thrifts went without a hitch 
despite familiar rumblings in the credit markets that the supply 
would be tough to absorb and distribute profitably demand was good 
at the auction of the dubiously nicknamed bailout bonds the 
average yield on the 452 billion of tenders accepted was 815 
percent 
nearly 13 billion in bids were received at what was the first 
30year bond auction by resolution funding corp known as refcorp 
which was created to raise some of the cash needed to save 
troubled savings institutions 
what is called the bidtocover ratio was 287 to 1 the ratio 
which compares the number of bids received to the number accepted 
is a measure of investor demand 
surprisingly the ratio produced in the bailout bond auction was 
better than at recent sales of 30year treasury bonds historically 
considered the bestquality government debt securities 
part of the bailoutbond buying interest came from bond dealers 
planning to strip the issue for repackaging as a zerocoupon 
security 
the dealers intend to sever the interest payment part of the 
bond from the principal payment portion and sell the two pieces 
separately at a deep discount to face value or par zeros are 
bonds lacking the coupons that entitle a bondholder to periodic 
interest payments all the interest is paid at maturity 
i am very pleased with how well the auction went said 
michael e basham deputy assistant treasury secretary 
given that the bond market always gets edgy ahead of longterm 
debt auctions particularly when new types of securities are 
involved basham said it went exceptionally well 
as expected the bailout bonds sold wednesday went for a slight 
premium over the yield on recently auctioned treasury issues of the 
same maturity the benchmark 30year treasury bond closed trading 
in the credit markets wednesday at an average yield of 788 
percent making the premium 027 point 
the market doesnt perceive refcorps bonds to be quite as 
unshakable as regular treasury securities which have the 
comforting support of the federal governments full faith and 
credit 
but the government does guarantee that interest and principal 
will be paid on refcorps bonds granting them almost the same 
strong backing market analysts say once investors become 
accustomed to dealing with the bailout bonds the spread between 
treasuries and refcorp issues will shrink 
i think this is a name that people eventually will become 
familiar with and a little bit more comfortable with says carol 
a stone a senior economist at nomura securities international 
inc subsequently we can look for narrower spreads between the 
treasurys 30year bonds and refcorps 
refcorp has authority to issue up to 30 billion in 30year 
bonds and it is expected that auctions will be held once a quarter 
basham said the next sale likely would occur in january

pork producers are bracing for a drop in hog prices after an 
unusual autumn rally appeared to reach its peak in the past week 
but analysts say the descent probably will be less dramatic than 
the dizzying sixweek rise because farmers marketed hogs 
aggressively as prices climbed and the animals now coming to market 
are smaller than in past years 
on other commodity markets in the past week copper prices 
nosedived amid fears that the stock markets gyrations signal 
economic troubles ahead precious metals rallied energy prices 
fell wheat retreated and corn and soybeans held steady 
the hog futures market appeared to peak on monday when the 
contract for december delivery reached 4790 cents a pound on the 
chicago mercantile exchange the price fell to 4617 cents by the 
end of trading friday 
mondays high price represented a 16 percent increase in hog 
futures since sept 8 the starting point for the markets surge 
analysts cited two main reasons for the upswing which defied 
the normal seasonal pattern high beef prices and strong japanese 
demand for us pork 
beef prices reached record highs last spring partly due to 
droughtrelated herd thinning during the previous summer and 
havent backed off much since 
with beef so expensive consumers gravitated toward lowerpriced 
pork retailers seeking to fill that demand bid up wholesale pork 
prices and the increase worked its way back to the meatpackers who 
buy hogs from producers 
meanwhile tighter supplies of pork from denmark and taiwan 
forced the japanese to increase their purchases of us pork by 30 
percent over a year ago according to a recent report from the 
futures brokerage allendale inc 
as a result cash hog prices soared and are expected to average 
about 48 per hundredweight this month in iowa and southern 
minnesota compared with about 40 last october 
and for only the second time in the last 20 years according to 
analyst charles levitt of shearson lehman hutton inc the october 
average hog price will be near or higher than the july average 
which was 4822 per hundredweight this year compared with 4659 
in 1988 
the runup peaked at the wholesale level about two weeks ago as 
the japanese completed their buying hog slaughters approached 
their seasonal peak consumer demand slackened due to the higher 
pork prices and retailers began shifting their sights to obtaining 
poultry for the upcoming holidays 
on monday oct 16 levitt said fresh pork loins were quoted at 
121 a pound one week later the price had dropped to 110 to 
112 and by this past thursday the price had fallen further to 
104 to 107 
levitt said hog prices are likely to continue weakening through 
thanksgiving but because producers were active sellers during the 
rally cash hog prices may not drop much below 44 per 
hundredweight he said 
because the hogs are lighter in weight and producers are much 
more current on marketings we are could get a much softer landing 
this time than we have in recent years and especially last year 
he said when cash hogs bottomed at less than 38
