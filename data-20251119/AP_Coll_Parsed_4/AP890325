house and senate leaders predict smooth 
sailing for a new policy toward central america containing 45 
million for nicaraguan guerrillas even though some conservatives in 
congress say they will try to change it 
nicaraguas leftist government said it didnt like the us 
program either 
in managua foreign ministry secretarygeneral alejandro bendana 
called the plan confusing and unclear and said it goes against 
a regional pact that calls for dismantling the rebel force by 
midmay 
humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a 
contradiction in terms bendana said 
the new policy was announced at a white house news conference 
friday by president bush and leaders of congress and was hailed as 
a bipartisan approach to foreign policy 
in contrast to the bitter fights of the past decade over central 
america bush said congress and the white house will be speaking 
with one voice on the region 
secretary of state james a baker iii conceded the collapse of 
the reagan administrations effort to oust the leftist sandinista 
government of nicaragua with a military victory by the contra 
rebels 
we all have to admit that the policy basically failed to some 
extent because we were not united baker said we had an 
executive branch going in one direction and a legislative branch 
going in another 
does it mean an end to the war lets hope so baker said 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros lauded the plan as a very 
significant step that will keep their fighters alive while 
diplomatic peace efforts are pursued 
the agreement commits the administration to support central 
american peace efforts and provides for continuation of nonlethal 
aid for the contras for clothing food shelter and medical 
supplies at the rate of 45 million a month through february 1990 
the date set for elections in nicaragua 
moreover the accord provides funds for the first time for the 
voluntary resettlement of the contras within nicaragua to rejoin 
political life there 
amid all the talk of bipartisanship there was some grumbling 
an aide to sen jesse helms rnc said conservative senate 
republicans were particularly angry over the part of the accord 
dealing with relocation of the contras 
using the word relocation is a code word for sellout said 
the aide who spoke on condition of anonymity once you use that 
word it signifies that were bailing out of this 
the aide said helms planned to demand a vote on separate 
legislation that would provide 75 million in nonlethal aid to 
the rebels including items like radios gasoline and helicopter 
parts that could not be bought under the administrations proposal 
the 45 million outlay is expected to be approved by congress 
soon after it returns from its easter break next month 
the current appropriation of 271 million in humanitarian aid 
expires next friday congress halted military funding for the 
contras in february 1988 
baker said there were no plans to request further military aid 
but he added there is no bar or prohibition to that in this 
agreement in the event that conditions should deteriorate 
substantially 
the deal marks the first major element of bushs emerging 
foreign policy it was the result of weeks of negotiation between 
baker and congress many of the details were not spelled out in a 
broadly worded twopage statement but were part of a gentlemens 
agreement 
although it was not mentioned a key ingredient was a promise by 
baker that would allow any of four congressional committees to cut 
off the contras aid after november if it believed the presence of 
the rebels was harming regional peace efforts according to sources 
moreover house speaker jim wright dtexas said the 
administration had agreed that the contras would not engage in 
military action for any offensive purpose it was understood 
that violations would result in an automatic end to the aid 
bush said a peace agreement signed by the leaders of nicaragua 
honduras el salvador costa rica and guatemala calls for a free 
open political process in which all groups can participate the 
playing field must be level 
the burden of proof is on the sandinista government to comply 
with the promises that it has made since 1979 bush said and 
if they comply we have an opportunity to start a new day in 
central america 
the new accord was signed by bush wright house minority leader 
robert michel rill senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house 
majority leader thomas foley dwash 
with regard to nicaragua the agreement said the united 
states is united in its goals democratization an end to 
subversion and destabilization of its neighbors an end to soviet 
bloc military ties that threaten us and regional security 
while the contra funding is expected to win congressional 
approval dole said not every republican senator is enthusiastic 
about this program mitchell said the vote would not be unanimous 
among democrats either 
but wright said the program will deserve and will receive a 
support of the majority in the congress

they led snakedancing students in huge protests 20 
years ago but today japans radical leftists encounter the blank 
stare of indifference in a land blessed with affluence greater than 
anyone had dreamed 
although they got headlines with threatening to disrupt the 
summer olympics in seoul and emperor hirohitos funeral the 
radicals clearly have lost the widespread support of those days 
when student unrest swept campuses around the world 
a former radical looked back on the zeal of his college days 
with fondness but said they are gone for good the former member 
of the kakurokyo or revolutionary workers association now is a 
photographer for a conservative weekly news magazine 
when we were college students marxism was a fad he said 
asking that his name not be used students these days dont have 
any philosophy 
he said affluence was the main reason radicalism has lost its 
appeal but revulsion over the bloody acts of ultraleft groups 
also keeps their ranks small 
even housewives and businessmen sympathized with some protests a 
generation ago but the radical left sent itself into rapid decline 
with events in 1972 that shocked the nation the japanese red army 
attack at israels lod airport that killed 28 people and wounded 
dozens and the united red army slaughter of 14 members for alleged 
ideological deviations 
police actions and internecine violence have left many of the 
bestknown radical groups defunct weakened or based outside japan 
national police officials still fear the japanese red army but 
say its membership has dwindled to about 20 it is based in lebanon 
and said to be run by fusako shigenobu who once worked in a soy 
sauce factory 
authorities believe the group is more capable of carrying out 
terrorist operations abroad and cite its alleged involvement in an 
explosion outside a us military club in naples last april it 
threatened to disrupt hirohitos funeral in feb 24 but did not do 
so 
another wellknown terrorist group the red army faction formed 
in 1969 is based in north korea and has virtually no organization 
left in japan 
takuji otsu the lawyer for an admitted hijacker said 
students today have the same amount of dissatisfaction with the 
government but they have a stronger sense of futility 
otsus client yasuhiro shibata a 35yearold member of the red 
army faction is being tried on charges that include forgery 
hostagetaking and grand theft 
japan had no laws on hijacking in 1970 when shibata then 16 
and eight others used samurai swords and a bomb to hijack a japan 
air lines flight to north korea 
he was arrested last year in japan after 15 years in pyongyang 
capital of north korea and three years in which his movements are 
unclear his accomplices remain in pyongyang and one is believed 
to have died 
involvement of a high school student in the hijacking stunned a 
people already unsettled by demonstrations against the education 
system vietnam war and a mutual security agreement with the united 
states 
shibata still supports revolution but said he returned to japan 
to establish an economic and social foundation for a new kind of 
political movement 
his lawyer said in an interview it would be meaningless for 
them to profess violence in todays society i think they have 
realized that they must do something more in tune with the 
times 
according to otsu his client will not explain what kind of new 
movement the radicals plan beyond saying it would try to solve 
specific problems and would not recruit in the colleges 
kaoru tsunoda a junior at japan womens university in tokyo 
said the leftist movement just doesnt have much to do with me i 
think making friends and creating a foundation for my own life is 
whats important 
miss tsunoda said she had begun trying to keep up on politics 
but largely because she thinks it will help her chances for a good 
job after graduation 
a recent survey by the government management and coordination 
agency found young japanese tend to be socially conservative 
apolitical and most interested in getting rich 
even in the early 1970s most abandoned activism after 
graduation to avoid rejection by prospective employers 
the most active radical group the chukakuha is a direct 
descendant of a factionridden movement of college students whose 
violent revolt disrupted campuses in march 1969 
strikes affected more than half the 377 universities that year 
and police arrested 10000 students they confiscated 12000 wooden 
staves 4000 iron bars and 4000 firebombs 
by 1985 arrests of radical leftists had fallen to about 100 
in a report on 1988 the national police agency estimated the 
number of radical leftists and anarchists in japan at about 35000 
compared with 53500 in 1969 with the number of activists much 
lower 
chukakuha or middle core faction has 30005000 members and 
several hundred radicals claim allegiance to the kakurokyo 
revolutionary workers association and the senkiha or battle 
flag faction 
all three oppose the mainstream japan communist party which 
they say is stalinist and antirevolutionary the party denounces 
them as trotskyite adventurers 
dozens of deaths have been reported in factional fights between 
the chukakuha and the kakumaruha or revolutionary marxist 
faction which supports the communist party

a 17yearold canadian youth was fatally 
shot by a us border patrol agent after illegally entering the 
united states and brandishing what appeared to be a revolver 
authorities said friday 
the gun jason haring pointed at the patrol agent thursday 
night was actually a replica they said 
border patrolman dale a rude shot haring about 400 yards east 
of the border station run by the us customs service in roosville 
in northwest montana authorities said 
det lt don bernall of the lincoln county sheriffs office said

crossed into the united states 
haring from kanata ontario walked away from a youth detention 
center in bellville ontario on march 11 authorities said 
a trucker alerted officers at the station that haring had been 
hitchhiking and officers saw the boy get out of a car on the 
canadian side of the border walk north along the highway and then 
cut to the east said deputy lincoln county attorney scott spencer 
rude went up a hill to a vantage point often used by officers 
spencer said rude spotted haring through binoculars then 
confronted him about 80 feet over the border and told him to stop 
he said 
spencer said rude told him haring then turned pulled what 
appeared to be a pistol and pointed it at him rude said he fired 
one shot from his 12gauge shotgun at the youth from a distance of 
12 to 15 feet spencer said 
haring died at the scene shot in the right shoulder and chest 
officials said 
lincoln county attorney susan loehn said friday afternoon that 
the fake gun haring brandished looked surprisingly real it has 
so much detail that its not what i think of as a toy gun she 
said 
the county is still investigating the shooting and will decide 
after a coroners inquest whether to prosecute rude she said 
the coroners jury will make a recommendation on whether the 
shooting was justifiable loehn said adding she wont make any 
decision on the matter until the inquest is completed 
jurors viewed harings body friday and an autopsy was conducted 
friday in missoula loehn said the inquest will not be held until 
results are returned from the state crime laboratory she said

the maker of the stealth fighter is facing a 
15 million fine for more than 400 alleged violations of 
workersafety laws at the california plant where it assembled the 
radarevading plane 
the fine against a division of the lockheed corp was proposed 
friday by the occupational safety and health administration which 
also announced it was launching a walltowall inspection of 
the burbank plant because of the alleged violations found during a 
fourmonth review of the stealth project 
under osha procedures lockheed has 15 working days to contest 
the proposed fine lockheed spokesman jim ragsdale said the company 
had no immediate comment and likely would not comment until its 
management had an opportunity to review the citations 
osha cited 251 instances in which it said lockheed aeronautical 
systems co willfully failed to record illnesses and injuries to 
employees and 88 alleged willful violations of federal regulations 
requiring employers to inform workers about the potential dangers 
of chemicals they work with and instruct them on proper safeguards 
in addition the company was cited for another 99 violations of 
various osha standards including alleged mislabeling or failure to 
label chemical containers and alleged failure to include health 
warnings on information the company was required to provide to its 
workers 
other alleged violations included failing to list suspected 
carcinogens on safety sheets provided to workers overexposing 
workers to asbestos and failure to provide workers with gloves 
impervious to a hazardous chemical used on the fighter 
the proposed fine follows an osha inspection based on numerous 
complaints from workers at the plant which employs about 14000 
people 
in october a month after the inspection began john c 
brizendine the president of the division said we have seen 
nothing to indicate the materials we work with are fundamentally 
unsafe or pose a health hazard provided proper procedures are 
followed 
a month later the government for the first time publicly 
acknowledged the existence of the stealth fighter a singleseat 
dualengine jet that resembles a bat and is formally designated the 
f117a 
the defense department has ordered 59 stealth fighters 52 had 
been delivered as of the november showing 
seventyfive employees at the plant have a suit pending against 
lockheed and companies that make and supply the chemicals used to 
help the fighter avoid radar detection more than 100 workers have 
filed workers compensation claims alleging they suffer from 
injuries caused by the chemicals 
the suit and the claims allege composite materials used in the 
fighter and chemicals used to mill and clean those materials cause 
rashes nausea dizziness memory loss and concentration problems 
osha spokesman frank kane said the fine represented the 
ninthlargest in the agencys 17year history and the largest ever 
levied in california the record fine was 51 million against two 
companies involved in an april 1987 bridgeport conn building 
collapse

the us official in charge of foreign 
disaster relief is calling on nations around the world to put the 
cash down and help avert a repetition of the massive starvation 
that afflicted sudan last year 
julia taft director of the state departments office of foreign 
disaster assistance said friday that unless a unsponsored 
emergency relief program succeeds hundreds of thousands could be 
lost 
the united nations estimated that more than 250000 sudanese 
died of starvation last year because food deliveries were impeded 
by the civil war between the sudanese government and the sudanese 
liberation peoples liberation army 
ms taft discussed the us role in operation lifeline the 
unsponsored effort designed to deliver more than 100000 tons of 
food to more than 1 million people next month project participants 
say it is the largest effort of its kind in a developing nation 
its a race against time ms taft said adding that unless 
the sudanese government the rebels the united nations and the 
donor nations pull together over the next few weeks we will see a 
repeat of last years horror 
april has been designated as a month of tranquility in 
sudans civil conflict 
everybody wants peace but peace will be a hollow victory if 
the people for whom peace is the goal are not alive because we 
cant deliver the food in time to save them ms taft said 
the food is to be delivered by train truck barge and air to 
remote areas in the south before seasonal rains and floods make 
transport routes impassable 
the cost of the un project is 132 million 55 million of 
which still must be raised 
ms taft said the united states has arranged to provide some 30 
million of that amount and is trying to arrange for an additional 
10 million to pay for a food swap that would trade some foods 
available in sudan for others that certain segments of the society 
need 
the 30 million is in addition to some 72 million in various 
forms of aid the united states has pledged to sudan since last 
february ms taft said 
but the united states is concerned because many nations that 
have pledged to help the un relief program with foodstuffs now 
need to come forward with cash in order to adapt to the emergency 
monthlong relief effort ms taft said 
we will deliver but were quite concerned that the other 
donors were not forthcoming for some reason were out there 
in front and we would like to expand the participation of other 
donors in this urgent effort she said we hope the consciences 
of these donors will find this opportunity to save lives and put 
the cash down 
she said she hoped nations such as japan and saudi arabia could 
assist the effort she noted that the soviet union was not at a 
recent conference in khartoum on the relief effort but they might 
well be asked to contribute since their own disaster they know 
the importance of an international effort 
she said it was up to the united nations to formally make such a 
request 
ms taft said she feared that because the crisis had not had the 
media coverage of the 1984 famine in ethiopia or even the december 
soviet earthquake in armenia the international community was not 
aware of the severity of the tragedy even though many nations are 
usually more than willing to help 
some disasters get such broad international coverage the 
whole world feels as though they had come to the aid of mankind 
ms taft said 
ms taft who will be in the region with a congressional 
delegation next week said the traditional donor nations such as 
the british dutch canadians and italians are all being asked to 
provide additional funding

the government will try to block oliver 
norths effort to get former president reagan to testify as leadoff 
witness for the defense at the irancontra trial next week 
the government has a court motion pending to quash the subpoena 
for reagan and we will pursue that matter david runkel an 
aide to attorney general dick thornburgh said friday 
the defense sought a court order seeking the former presidents 
appearance next friday following testimony in the past month at 
norths trial that reagan was deeply involved in helping the 
contras 
the judge in the north case us district judge gerhard a 
gesell is expected to schedule a hearing for next week to consider 
the defense request 
reagan and thenvice president george bush got subpoenas from 
north on dec 30 to testify at his trial but sought through the 
justice department to have them quashed gesell dismissed bushs 
subpoena but held reagans open pending trial developments 
the importance of mr reagans testimony to the defense of 
this case is clear both from the record in the trial to date and 
from a filing in january by north defense attorney brendan 
sullivan said in a court filing 
norths lawyers argued jan 23 that concerns about privileges 
for confidential communications and state secrets must yield to a 
demonstrated need for testimony 
subpoenas for the appearances of reagan and bush raise 
profound constitutional concerns thornburgh argued in january 
the concerns are in connection with executive privilege 
but also regarding the authority of the courts to compel 
appearances by a former or sitting president thornburgh said at 
the time 
the spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjected 
to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the 
way they deal with the president now and in the future 
thornburgh said 
reagan told the tower commission investigating the irancontra 
arms and money affair in january 1987 that he did not know his 
national security council staff including north was helping the 
contras 
according to testimony at norths trial reagan based on nsc 
staff recommendations 
secretly approved slipping 110 million worth of extra aid to 
honduras as an enticement for supporting the contras 
telephoned the president of honduras to gain release of an arms 
shipment that had been seized by the honduran military while en 
route to the contras 
apparently approved airdropping intelligence and recoilless 
rifles to the contras to destroy ships carrying arms to nicaragua 
the activities in question came in 1985 when congress had banned 
us military aid to the contras 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane testified that 
when reagan learned of a contra contribution from a foreign 
country the president said we shouldnt share that with 
congress 
he did not say to lie about it mcfarlane said of reagan 
he just said do not share that information 
north faces 12 criminal charges including six alleging he lied 
to congress about his activities on behalf of the contras

air force chief of staff gen larry welch d 
welch drew the wrath of defense secretary dick cheney for 
reportedly discussing with members of congress how to update the 
us nuclear deterrent 
cheney said friday that welch wasnt speaking for the 
department had no right do so and would be rebuked for doing it 
general welch was freelancing cheney told reporters 
saying no decisions on the issue had been reached 
i think its inappropriate for a uniformed officer to be in a 
position where he is in fact negotiating an arrangement cheney 
said i will make known to him my displeasure he was not 
speaking for the department 
a spokesman for welch who is the air forces top military 
officer said welch had no comment 
cheney said all of our options are open when it comes to the 
future of the landbased nuclear missile force 
the bush administration like the reagan administration before 
it is trying to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear missile 
to americas arsenal 
the pentagon has told congress it would like to buy 50 more of 
the 10warhead mx missiles and place them on railcar launchers 
congressional democrats however would prefer to see the 
development of a small singlewarhead midgetman missile that could 
be deployed on a truck launcher 
welch and navy adm william j crowe the chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff have been searching in recent days for a 
compromise 
according to some members of congress welch has suggested a 
compromise in which 50 mx missiles already deployed in silos would 
be shifted to rail launchers instead of purchasing new missiles 
while the number of midgetman missiles to be built would be scaled 
back from 500 to 300 
but cheney said no decision had been made 
to say that a compromise is near i think would be 
premature cheney said 
cheney declined to discuss cutting the pentagons budget as 
president bush has instructed saying he needed more time to review 
programs 
he did say that as a general priority he would rather reduce the 
size of the armed forces instead of returning to the days of a 
hollow military without adequate ammunition or spare parts 
in another development friday acting air force secretary james 
f mcgovern said he will step down later this spring to seek a job 
in the private sector 
mcgovern has served as the undersecretary or no 2 man in the 
air forces hierarchy since november 1986 and as the acting 
secretary since last december 
an associate of former sen john tower mcgovern had been widely 
expected to take on the air force post on a permanent basis had 
tower been confirmed as the secretary of defense 
towers nomination was rejected two weeks ago by the senate and 
president bush replaced him with cheney 
in a meeting i had with defense secretary cheney earlier this 
week i indicated that i was inclined to return to the private 
sector so that i could finally give my two daughters the attention 
they deserve and to pursue several other professional interests 
mcgovern said in a prepared statement 
an aide said mcgovern is planning to leave in may the aide who 
asked not to be named insisted that the controversy involving 
welch had played no role in mcgoverns decision

the air force says it has changed maintenance 
procedures for the b1bs fuel system and is studying whether 
structural changes should be made to the aircraft in the wake of a 
crash last november 
but the service on friday denied it had found any design or 
maintenance problems that contributed to the nov 8 accident near 
dyess air force base texas 
an internal air force report first disclosed by wbnstv in 
columbus ohio raised questions about the fuel systems design 
according to officials friday who spoke on condition they not be 
named 
whatever the exact cause a b1 design deficiency allowed the 
fuel in the overwing fairing to migrate into the compartment 
containing the environmental system precooler which reaches 
temperatures sufficient to provide ignition the internal 
document said 
the internal document elaborated on the findings of an accident 
report the air force made public in february on the texas crash 
the public report concluded the b1b crashed because a fire in 
the left wing knocked out two of the planes four engines and 
burned out critical control equipment all four crewmen parachuted 
to safety 
the public report also said the fire apparently had been fed by 
a ruptured fuel line in the portion of the wing that runs above the 
left engines but added the crash impact had destroyed evidence 
necessary to further isolate the cause of the fire and the exact 
location of the fuel leak 
the crew received no warning of a fire due to lack of a fire 
detection system in that section of the plane the internal 
report says 
when they did realize the plane was on fire they had no means 
to shut off fuel flow or suppress the fire in that area says 
the document 
the air force in its statement friday acknowledged the 
internal report had spawned a new study that could lead to 
structural changes 
the b1b program office is also assessing engineering 
proposals to design a fuel isolation and fire detection capability 
for the overwing fairing areas the air force said

wotan leader of the gods comes into the picture in act 2 he 
was sung by james morris whose voice is brighter than many basses 
who sing wotan his wife fricka was sung by christa ludwig in a 
way that sounded more like explaining than laying down the law 
hildegard behrens as wotans warrior daughter brunnhilde was 
girlishly exuberant at first later when she has less to be 
exuberant about she maintained an attractive girlish quality in 
her singing 
a variety of vocal shadings kept the singing interesting miss 
norman particularly had many colors and textures in her singing 
morris salminen and miss norman were singing their parts at the

authorities said they scored a big victory when 
nine members of what was once the citys largest drug ring received 
lengthy federal prison terms but they added that the fight is far 
from over 
its a continuing problem and im not going to say weve 
turned the corner yet said us attorney roy c hayes who 
prosecuted the case but weve made a significant dent 
us district judge richard f suhrheinrich gave the maximum 
prison term to eight of the nine chambers brothers gang members 
sentenced friday the members were convicted oct 28 following a 
sixweek trial 
there are crimes against civilization for which there is no 
excuse and this is one them suhrheinrich said how can we 
have any regard for people who are destroying future generations 
so far no drug gang has succeeded in replacing the chambers 
brothers although many are vying for the role hayes said 
im hoping that the era of big drug gangs in detroit has ended 
with this trial hayes said what weve shown is that a big 
powerful and violent drug gang can be put out of business 
there is no shortage of drug suspects according to police 
statistics drugrelated arrests in detroit increased 123 percent 
in the 12 months ending nov 30 1988 compared with the same 
12month period the previous year police spokesman christopher 
buck said 
buck said the increase does not mean the drug problem in detroit 
has worsened the rise in drug arrests from 4102 in 198687 to 
9520 in 198788 was due primarily to an anticrack offensive that 
helped reduce overall crime he said 
suhrheinrich said he imposed the maximum sentence possible in 
most cases because of the seriousness of the crack threat in 
detroit 
it crack is indeed doing to our poor people what no person 
could do it is enslaving them suhrheinrich said before 
sentencing its doing what hitler could never do to us 
larry chambers 39 the reputed leader of the gang was 
sentenced to life in prison and a 250000 fine for operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
billy joe chambers 26 was sentenced to more than 45 years and 
a 500000 fine for conspiracy and operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise 
otis chambers was sentenced to more than 27 years and a 350000 
fine for conspiracy and willie chambers was sentenced to more than 
21 years and a 350000 fine for conspiracy and tax evasion 
also convicted of conspiracy and sentenced friday were gang 
members eric l wilkins more than 33 years in prison elaine 
coleman lucas 10 years belinda lumpkin 25 years jerry gant 30 
years and marshall glenn 30 years 
only lucas received less than the maximum sentence because of 
her minor role in the ring the judge said 
the chambers brothers gang was notorious for its corporatelike 
structure according to witnesses testimony the ring supplied 
cocaine to as many as half of detroits estimated 1000 crack 
houses from 1982 until 1988 prosecutors said 
hayes said the stiff sentences will send an important message to 
wouldbe drug dealers battling to fill the void created by breakup 
of the chambers gang 
police alone cant stem the tide of drugs in detroit 
suhrheinrich said in an often emotional 20minute presentencing 
speech 
where is the community where is the press where is the 
mayor where is the governor where is the president 
suhrheinrich said until we in the united states demand and are 
allowed to walk down streets without drug dealers putting us in 
fear then we will never improve our institutions

a satellite circled earth on a 
missilehunting assignment today as part of research into a 
spacedbased defense system after passing its first tracking test 
within hours of soaring into orbit 
the 3ton delta star payload rocketed into space friday to begin 
a monthslong mission during which it is to aim its sensors at 
several groundbased missile and space launches 
the research could help perfect the technology for detecting and 
destroying enemy missiles within minutes after they leave their 
launch pads 
the satellite passed its first trial within two hours after 
liftoff when it successfully tracked the thrusting second stage of 
its own delta booster rocket after separation and during its fiery 
destruction in the atmosphere over the indian ocean 
we watched that burn with the sensors we not only got the 
second stage burning but we also got the reentry and breakup 
said air force col michael rendine program manager for the 
strategic defense initiative office we had a perfect ride into 
space and the spacecraft is operating just like we expected it 
to 
researchers especially want to gather rocket exhaust data 
against the background of the north pole region an area through 
which attacking soviet missiles would travel 
well observe a large number of booster rockets as well as 
characterize a number of backgrounds such as the aurora borealis 
northern lights said michael griffin director of technology 
for the strategic defense initiative office we have to know what 
rockets look like from space when they are launched from the ground 
against various environmental backgrounds 
rendine said the delta star experiment is part of the research 
being done for the strategic defense initiative or star wars 
program to develop a spacebased missile defense system 
the satellite carried laser radar seven video imaging cameras 
and an infrared imager a laser illumination detection system was 
designed to spot groundbased laser firings a capability that 
would permit future satellites to take evasive action 
using a 48jet thruster aiming system delta star has the 
capability to maneuver into position to spot the blazing plume of 
missiles and rockets to be launched over the next several months 
from cape canaveral wallops island va white sands nm poker 
flats alaska barking sands hawaii and perhaps from soviet 
launch sites 
besides quickly locating a rocket plume researchers want the 
sensors to gather information to help distinguish various 
backgrounds such as land ocean horizon space atmospheric 
effects and the aurora borealis 
as envisioned by former president reagan who proposed it in 
1983 the stars wars defense shield would include several hundred 
large orbiting platforms equipped with rockets and hundreds of 
supporting surveillance and tracking satellites 
but the program on which 16 billion has been spent so far has 
met with increasing resistance from a budgetminded congress and 
officials have spoken in recent months of a modified or scaleddown 
system president bush has said he supports it but his 
administration is reviewing other strategic systems as well 
vice president dan quayle earlier this week endorsed a new 
version of the program known as brilliant pebbles citing its 
small size comparatively low cost and fast schedule for 
development 
the brilliant pebbles technology would involve thousands of 
small satellites that could home in on enemy missiles and destroy 
them by colliding with them

the treasury departments bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms has ordered the customs service to halt 
shipments of more than 400000 militarystyle assault weapons at 
the nations borders a newspaper reported 
bureau officials stunned that hundreds of thousands of weapons 
such as the ak47 had already been approved for import in effect 
is rescinding that approval the los angeles times reported in its 
saturday editions 
the action goes beyond steps taken earlier in march when the 
bush administration announced a temporary ban on issuing of new 
permits for five types assault weapon including the ak47 the 
weapon used earlier this year in a massacre of schoolchildren in 
stockton calif 
william t drake a top official at atf acknowledged in an 
interview with the times that the move would be controversial but 
he said an internal audit detailing the vast extent of imports 
already authorized had persuaded the agency to take the emergency 
action 
the bureau declined to disclose how many weapons have been 
approved for import but an unidentified customs service source 
cited by the times said the number is more than 400000 
the weapons were not affected by the moratorium which only 
blocked approval of new applications for weapons imports when the 
action was taken new applications to import 110000 assault 
weapons were pending 
the moratorium will be lifted only if importers can prove that 
the weapons are used generally for sporting purposes 
about 70000 assault rifles have been imported into the united 
states in the last three years according to the agency 
the atf order was transmitted orally thursday and made formal in 
a directive issued by drake on friday

an island in the firth of forth 
that may have inspired robert louis stevensons treasure island 
has been purchased by admirers of its resident seabirds 
the royal society for the preservation of birds said friday it 
had purchased 12acre fidra island for 3200 from the northern 
lighthouse board whose former employees include stevensons father 
robert louis stevenson was brought up in edinburgh and his 
family spent holidays for many years at north berwick said iain 
illingworth the societys reserves manager for east scotland 
fidra 15 miles east of edinburgh and a halfmile off shore in 
the river forth has a 56foot high lighthouse and ruins of a 
12thcentury chapel dedicated to st nicholas 
i dont think there is any very hard evidence but it is 
believed that it is the inspiration for treasure island 
illingworth said 
the treeless islands 50foot cliffs are a very important site 
for nesting seabirds and its important that it be allowed to 
carry on said illingworth among the residents are puffins 
kittiwakes razorbills guillemots fulmars and shags 
more than 200 eider duck nests were found on the island last 
year he said 
its only sort of 15 miles from edinburgh yet its a jewel in 
the firth of forth because it is very little visited and it has 
these cliffs its an excellent place for birds to breed

for the past month andrea gail cervantes has made 
her family crack their eggs at the top not in the middle 
thats so they can fill them with confetti decorate them and 
smash the eggs called cascarones on the heads of friends and 
relatives a tradition in the cervantes family and many other 
mexicanamerican families for generations 
the spanish word for eggshell is cascaron and for many 
mexicanamerican families they are an essential part of easter 
celebrations 
its a tradition mexicans are reared on said ms cervantes 
mother also named andrea 
for some families its a yearlong project 
judith zaffirini a state senator from laredo has been saving 
eggshells since last easter 
we collect yearround we never stop said mrs zaffirini 
who has a 7yearold son i keep them in the cabinets in the 
kitchen at christmas thats when we really collect a lot of 
cascarones because i make a lot of sweets 
but this year we have fewer easter eggs because my husband 
used to eat two eggs for breakfast now he only has one 
last year the zaffirini family collected more than 100 dozen 
eggshells 
the craft of filling the eggs with confetti and covering the 
shells with tissue paper can be a profitable business especially 
this time of year 
jesse moreno special activities coordinator for el mercado the 
market in downtown san antonio said some vendors sell the eggs 
all year 
san antonio residents not only purchase cascarones for easter 
celebrations they also stockpile them for fiesta a weeklong 
citywide celebration of parades and parties that follow easter 
vendors along the texas border with mexico sell cascarones by 
the bag with customers able to get 100 for about 150 
stories of cascarones origination vary but all seem to tie it 
to europe 
a 1980 brochure published by the conservation society in san 
antonio said perfumefilled eggshells were used in italy during the 
renaissance according to that account carlotta wife of 
maximillian an austrian duke who established an empire in mexico 
for napoleon iii brought them with her to mexico 
moreno said perfumefilled cascarones were brought to italy from 
china by marco polo they eventually made their way into spain and 
then to mexico somewhere along the line the perfume was replaced 
with confetti he said 
the empty eggshell is said to symbolize the empty tomb of jesus 
christ the colorful confetti is a reminder of the joy of the 
christian belief in christs resurrection 
the cascarones are the center of many celebrations such as 
birthdays weddings and even christmas but are most important at 
easter 
families often color and fill the shells together 
like hardboiled easter eggs cascarones are placed in baskets 
or hidden but often the eggs are carried to a picnic spot in a 
park where children and adults try to sneak up and smash the eggs 
on each others heads 
i sit down with the kids and we paint and decorate them its 
a lot of fun and we can share a moment or two and do things 
together said eddie lucio a state representative from 
brownsville who says he also made cascarones as a youngster 
we do get together and set out some ground rules and rule no 
1 is not to get mad rule no 2 is not to hurt anybody and rule no 
3 is to clean up the mess lucio said

randall dale adams attended a quiet family 
gathering and toured his hometown during his first full day back 
since his release from prison 
but the man who spent 12 years behind bars in texas for a crime 
he says he didnt commit appeared less concerned about the future 
than about adjusting to the life he left in 1977 when he was 
sentenced to death 
to be able to dress like a human being again that adds to 
your selfconfidence adams said friday at a relatives home 
south of columbus to be able to go out among people and not be 
an inmate a convict that improves your outlook 
adams case had garnered wide attention after the thin blue 
line a documentary raised doubts about his guilt in the 
shooting death of dallas officer robert wood 
he came within three days of execution in 1980 for the murder 
before his sentence was commuted to life in prison 
at the family gathering adams told columbus television station 
wbns that he received a card containing a check from an anonymous 
source in the mail friday he didnt reveal the amount of the check 
adams 40 who worked as a clerk in the prison maintenance 
office and earned an associate degree in general studies while 
imprisoned said he has no immediate job plans columbus mayor dana 
rinehart has offered him unspecified employment with the city 
he was greeted by yellow ribbons and rousing cheers when he 
returned thursday to columbus 
on march 1 the texas court of criminal appeals had ordered a 
new trial for him saying a witness had lied and a prosecutor 
suppressed evidence and on thursday the dallas county texas 
district attorney dropped the case against him citing a lack of 
evidence 
adams spent much of his day out of the public eye 
all was quiet at the blue and white trailer home on the citys 
west side where adams mother mildred has lived since she sold 
her house in suburban grove city to help pay her sons legal bills 
mrs adams said her son embarked on a tour of the city early in 
the morning with filmmaker errol morris who directed the thin 
blue line 
in texas a juror said she was convinced she had erred in 
declaring adams guilty 
if he had gone to the death chamber and all this had come out 
later that would have been a horrible thing to have on my 
conscience said bette jane fain the jury forewoman at adams 
1977 trial

a 2yearold boy whose footprints led 
to the edge of a 500footdeep abandoned mine shaft was found dead 
friday night after searchers built a road to the site and then 
shored up the unstable opening authorities said 
at 1041 pm the body was brought up out of the shaft 
said gilpin county dispatcher dodie shaw 
she said the body of the child identified as michael mills was 
recovered from a depth of about 200 feet 
authorities said the toddlers babysitter was watching the boy 
friday afternoon then went inside for a moment to answer the 
telephone when she returned about 245 pm the boy was gone 
searchers followed the boys tracks from his home to the mine 
shaft about 100 yards away 
the little footprints in the snow went up to the shaft there 
were no other tracks they did see the slide marks that went down 
into the mouth of the shaft said gilpin county sheriff rosetta 
anderle 
search of the abandoned mine shaft was delayed several hours as 
a 200yard road had to be cut to the hilly site 
then heavy timbers were placed across the unstable shaft opening 
and a network of chains and cables rigged for reinforcement 
a boom truck with a cable winch was brought to the shaft opening 
and a cage with two rescue workers lowered into the shaft about 10 
pm 
i want to keep all the hope i can said town marshal elmo 
gatlin earlier when asked of the little boys chances 
about 40 rescue workers took part in the search under the bright 
glare of floodlights in mild weather friday night 
taylor said loose rock and gravel around the mine shaft opening 
made it difficult to move the boom truck to the opening and allow 
rescuers to be lowered into the mine in a cage 
authorities said there were probably 5000 abandoned mine shafts 
in the central city area many of them uncovered 
taylor said the mine shaft was inside this historic mining 
towns city limits but in a residential area away from the 
commercial district

joel steinberg convicted of killing his 
illegally adopted daughter has been sentenced to the maximum 8 13 
to 25 years in prison after being described as callous selfish and 
manipulative 
the disbarred attorney slumped in resignation upon hearing state 
supreme court justice harold rothwax issue the sentence for his 
manslaughter conviction in the november 1987 death of 6yearold 
lisa 
the defendant had spent nearly 20 minutes protesting his 
innocence saying he was guilty only of an error in judgment 
for not immediately getting medical help for the child when she 
fell unconscious 
near tears and almost pleading steinberg told rothwax that he 
never hit lisa and said she received constant love 
those children were not locked in a house of horror 
steinberg said of lisa and the baby boy he called mitchell also 
illegally adopted 
but assistant district attorney john mccusker told the court 
lisas death was a result of steinbergs life of violence 
selfishness and selfgratification at the expense of other people 
mr steinberg has shown not one ounce of remorse for killing 
elisabeth mccusker said 
i understand the meaning of remorse said steinberg who had 
not testified at the trial i have remorse about losing my life 
i feel that pain every day its my loss im the victim 
hedda nussbaum steinbergs battered former livein companion 
and the key prosecution witness against him watched the sentencing 
on television at the manhattan office of her lawyer betty 
levinson she heard steinberg say lisa was fine when he left her 
with ms nussbaum 46 and went to dinner with a friend 
he just got up there and lied and shes furious ms 
levinson said of ms nussbaums reaction he was weaving together 
this totally untrue and fantastic rendition of what happened 
steinberg 47 said lisa received constant nurturing constant 
caring constant love and described their life in a greenwich 
village townhouse where mark twain once lived as joyous superb 
delightful 
steinberg denied hitting the child but said i dont deny 
that during the course of administering cpr ok i could have 
caused some injury 
he dispassionately discussed the technical aspects of lisas 
bruises more as a lawyer rather than a defendant 
steinberg suddenly stopped and told rothwax your honor is 
laughing 
im not laughing the judge im just astonished 
at several points during steinbergs discussion of lisa her 
natural mother michele launders and graceann smigiel the boys 
maternal grandmother wept 
steinberg smiled chuckled and fidgeted while his lawyers 
offered lengthy presentencing motions all of which were denied by 
rothwax 
in a brief preamble to the sentence rothwax said steinbergs 
extraordinary narcissism and selfinvolvement his extreme need 
to control led him to become the instrument of lisas death 
the judge also fined steinberg 5000 and recommended against 
parole 
steinberg has been held without bail since his arrest nov 2 
1987 so he will eligible for parole in seven years having already 
served 16 months of the 8 13year minimum sentence 
even without parole new yorks general practice would allow 
steinberg to serve only twothirds of his maximum 16 years and 
eight months in this case since he can earn onethird of his 
sentence off for good behavior 
rothwax received hundreds of letters from adoptive parents 
childless couples and people abused as children urging him to 
give steinberg the maximum term 
perry reich a attorney for steinberg said a notice of appeal 
was filed friday adding were very optimistic it is fair to 
say this was just round one

the calm waters of prince william sound 
have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in us 
history which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid 
chunks of ice officials said 
the spill of some 270000 barrels or 113 million gallons 
occurred early friday when the 987foot tanker exxon valdez went 
hard aground on bligh reef about 25 miles outside valdez the 
northermost icefree port in the united states 
coast guard spokesman ed wieliczkiewicz said the use of 
chemicals to disperse and sink the heavy north slope crude oil 
failed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up 
the oil 
he said exxon officials plan to pump the oil remaining aboard 
the exxon valdez onto the exxon baton rouge another tanker 
early friday the exxon valdez was losing 20000 gallons of oil 
per hour but the flow slowed to a trickle later 
an oil slick snaked about five miles from the ship as wind and 
tide pushed the crude oil into the sound and away from shore 
this is the largest oil spill in us history and it 
unfortunately took place in an enclosed water body with numerous 
islands channels bays and fiords said richard golob publisher 
of the golob oil pollution bulletin 
gov steve cowper said the ship was impaled on the reef he 
said the vessel steered from its course to avoid chunks of ice and 
did not return to its normal traffic lane 
dan lawn an engineer for the state department of environmental 
conservation said the captain could not steer the exxon valdez 
back on course in time to avoid a collision 
lawn likened the ships situation to trying to park a cadillac 
in a volkswagen spot 
divers were to check the ships hull and their findings were to 
be used in making plans for the removal of crude oil still aboard 
the vessel 
a spill of this size in such a complex environment promises to 
be a cleanup nightmare said golob a cambridge massbased 
consultant whose firm has studied oil spills and environmental 
disasters for 15 years 
in washington interior department spokesman steve goldstein 
said efforts had begun to evacuate waterfowl sea otters and other 
wildlife from the danger area 
the exxon valdez had loaded 12 million barrels of oil at the 
alyeska pipeline service co marine terminal at valdez and was en 
route to long beach calif when it crunched onto the reef the 
ship marks the second aniversary of its maiden voyage today 
the terminal was closed early friday to tanker traffic as 
officials tried to deal with the mammoth spill the flow in the 
transalaska oil pipeline also was reduced to 800000 barrels daily 
from 12 million barrels 
alyeska spokesman tom brennan said that at the reduced rate 
the marine terminals capacity would allow nine days of operation 
before the line would have to be shut down 
valdez a town of about 3000 yearround residents that grows to 
more than 4000 with a summer influx of fishing industry workers 
and travelers is a picturesque community about 125 miles east of 
anchorage 
it relies on the fishing oil and tourism industries the sound 
is considered a playground for kayakers sport fishermen and 
tourists 
jason wells executive director of the valdez fisheries 
development association said he believed the oil slick would cause 
little damage unless wind pushes it back toward valdez the fishing 
industry is between seasons 
wells said the black cod fishery is scheduled to begin april 1 
but the regions major herring fishery is not expected to get under 
way until midapril 
but the spill likely will draw increasing fire from 
environmentalists sensitive about the transalaska pipeline and 
efforts to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil 
development 
its of concern for two reasons one is the size of the spill 
and that this is such a sensitive very productive area said 
lisa speer senior staff scientist with the natural resources 
defense council in new york 
valdez city manager doug griffin said the 800mile transalaska 
pipeline which carries oil from prudhoe bay to valdez and the 
marine terminal have an enviable environmental record but he added 
living in valdez weve always worried that sometime something 
like this could happen 
previously the largest us tanker spill was the dec 15 1976 
grounding of the argo merchant tanker off the nantucket shoals off 
massachusetts in which 76 million gallons of oil spilled golob 
said 
the largest tanker spill in history was in the july 19 1979 
collision off tobago of the supertankers atlantic empress and 
aegean captain in which 300000 tons more than 80 million 
gallons of oil was lost

a federal appeals panel in florida has ordered a 
lower court to reconsider eastern airlines request that pilots be 
ordered back to work as a strike against the carrier enters its 
fourth week 
in another development the trustee of the new york bankruptcy 
court hearing the eastern case harry jones said friday he was 
conducting a careful search for a bankruptcy examiner 
the miami herald reported in todays editions that jones said he 
was looking for someone us bankruptcy court judge burton r 
lifland knows and trusts to mediate disputes among easterns 
management and unions investigate the airlines sale of eastern 
assets to parent texas air corp and report back to the judge and 
jones 
also friday lifland extended his order that other airlines 
honor agreements on ticket baggage and cargo transfers eastern 
badly needs to keep its few remaining flights in operation he 
barred striking machinists from picketing on the sidewalk in front 
of easterns terminal at bostons logan international airport and 
flight attendants at easterns sister carrier continental airlines 
ended a fourday strike that had little apparent effect 
the developments came on the 21st day of the strike by easterns 
8500member machinists union which has been honored by most of 
the airlines pilots and flight attendants 
of easterns prestrike daily roster of 1040 flights about 10 
percent are still running all on the airlines northeast shuttle 
and latin american routes 
in tallahassee the 11th us circuit court of appeals told us 
district judge edward davis in miami to hold new hearings to 
determine whether the walkout by easterns 3600 pilots is a 
sympathy strike as the pilots claim or a de facto pilots strike 
seeking its own aims as eastern management contends 
eastern had asked the appeals court to overturn davis earlier 
ruling permitting the air line pilots association to honor the 
machinists pickets under the railway labor act of 1926 
a claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext to 
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the 
railway labor act the appeals court said 
the ruling called on davis to report back to the appeals court 
after his hearings on the issue 
a statement issued by eastern said that if davis finds the 
pilots union has stayed off the job primarily to pursue its own 
bargaining objectives the court would be expected to order them 
back to work 
the pilots said they were satisfied with the ruling 
the appeals court denied easterns request for an immediate 
injunction and the lawful pilots sympathy strike shall continue 
an a pilots union statement said 
after cutting fares on its northeast shuttle service linking 
boston new york and washington to as low as 12 to combat the 
strike eastern on friday raised ticket prices on those runs to 
their original 99 daily and 69 weekend fares 
in new york lifland granted a twoweek extension to an order 
that competitors honor interline agreements after eastern 
attorneys said the carriers few remaining services would be 
crippled without cooperation from other airlines 
liflands order barring eastern machinists picketing on a 
150yardlong sidewalk in front of easterns terminal at logan 
international airport followed the airlines complaint that 
machinists were trespassing on private property 
but lifland also said his court could not and would not bar 
picketing altogether he said he only wanted to ensure the strikers 
remained in authorized areas 
in houston texas spokeswoman myra clayton of the union of 
flight attendants said the union notifed continental flight 
attendants to return to work 
no flights were disrupted or canceled because of the walkout 
continental said the airline claimed only 200 light attendants 
took part in the walkout while the union claimed more than 1200 
of their members struck 
the 6000member union called the walkout monday to protest what 
it said were substandard wages and working conditions

a 2yearold boy wandered away from 
his home in this historic silver mining town and fell to his death 
in a nearby abandoned mine shaft authorities said 
gilpin county coroner dick allen said the child identified as 
michael mills apparently was killed instantly from massive head 
injuries 
john rittenhouse search coordinator for the gilpin county 
search and rescue team said the boys body was found friday night 
about 150 to 200 feet down the shaft lodged among timbers and 
rocks he said the shaft went far below that point 
central city in the foothills of the rocky mountains about 30 
miles west of denver was a silver mining boom town from the 
mid1800s till the turn of the century 
authorities said probably 5000 abandoned mine shafts are in the 
area many of them uncovered 
the boy had been playing in his yard with his older sister whom 
rittenhouse described as being in her 20s 
there was a phone call and when she came back out he was gone 
we were called out about 245 pm we followed his tracks up to 
an abandoned mine shaft thats maybe 100 yards behind his house and 
found an area that something apparently had slid down into the mine 
shaft rittenhouse said 
the mine rescue unit was then called out and an access road had 
to be bulldozed about 100 yards up a hill to the shaft site he 
said 
a special boom truck rigged with cable winch and an enclosed 
cage was brought to the mouth of the shaft 
two men were lowered in the cage about 10 pm 
we got down about 50 feet with the cage and the shaft narrowed 
to the point the cage wouldnt go any furthur rittenhouse said 
at that point we pulled it up and hooked a smaller ore bucket to 
our boom truck and lowered it down with two men in it we were able 
to get down to the boy 
the boys body was found about 1040 pm rittenhouse said 
about 30 rescue workers participated in the search under the 
bright glare of floodlights in mild weather

an emergency relief effort to help 
the hundreds of thousands of people facing starvation in southern 
sudan can begin now that rebels have pledged their support a un 
official said today 
richard s reid regional director of the un childrens fund 
for the middle east and north africa said operation lifeline 
will be the biggest emergency relief operation of its kind in the 
world 
un officials announced thursday at the united nations that the 
rebels agreed to back the aid program marking a breakthrough in 
protracted negotiations with the sudan government and the 
insurgents to protect relief workers from rebel attacks 
reid said today that rebel leaders are now impatient for the 
relief effort to begin he said they strongly and emphatically 
support it 
it is time for the united nations and the relief donor 
governments and agencies to start the relief action to couple 
words with deeds reid said 
he said he hoped to show results not later than april 1 
in washington on friday the us official in charge of foreign 
disaster relief called on nations around the world to put the 
cash down and help southern sudan 
julia taft director of the state departments office of foreign 
disaster assistance said unless the unsponsored emergency 
relief program succeeds hundreds of thousands of sudanese could 
die 
she said the relief program will cost an estimated 132 million 
with 55 million of that amount still to be raised 
reid flew friday from amman jordan to addis ababa where he 
met officials of the sudan peoples liberation army they have 
fought a sixyear civil war to gain more autonomy for the mostly 
christian and animist south from the mainly moslem north which 
controls the government 
the united nations earlier urged the rebels to accept a 
sixmonth ceasefire offered by the government but they rejected 
the proposal 
as an alternative the united nations proposed both sides in the 
civil war agree to safeguard emergency relief corridors for 
at least one month 
under the plan the united nations with donor governments and 
agencies plans to transport about 100000 metric tons of food 
medicine and other relief supplies to southern sudan before heavy 
summer rains begin in may 
a metric ton is equivalent to 2205 pounds 
the supplies are to be transported through eight corridors on 
barges trucks railroads and airplanes they will move from 
sudans capital khartoum and from neighboring ethiopia uganda 
and kenya 
reid said the relief must be delivered before the rainy season 
if we are to avoid the catastrophe of last year in which an 
estimated 250000 people died 
the rainy season makes surface transport virtually impossible 
and air transport difficult between may and november 
reid said the sudanese government and the rebels would assist in 
distributing the aid 
he said the relief operation will be about the same size as a 
major drought relief drive in ethiopia in 198788 but he said the 
sudan effort will be carried out in a shorter time

wounded since march 8 when clashes broke out between gen michel 
aouns christian troops and militiamen of druse warlord walid 
jumblatts progressive socialist party syrian troops earlier this

government for control of this divided nation which has endured 14 
years of civil war 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
rules said the new casualties were civilians the spokesman said 
no christian soldiers were injured and he knew nothing of any 
casualties on the other side 
the independent daily newspaper annahar published in 
syrianpoliced moslem west beirut said aouns gunners operating 
usdesigned 155mm howitzers scored direct hits on syrian army 
positions in seven towns and villages around beirut it gave no 
casualty figures 
syrian army gunners pounded christian towns northeast of beirut 
with 107mm sovietdesigned grad rockets from multibarrelled 
launchers deployed along mountains south and east of the capital 
the barrage several times reached as high as 80 rounds a minute 
before the artillery duel tapered off into sporadic exchanges at 
daybreak the police spokesman said 
syria the main powerbroker in lebanon keeps 40000 troops in 
lebanon under a 1976 arab league mandate to end the civil war 
flashes from artillery explosions cut the darkness as the thuds 
of bombardment shook beirut and surrounding areas 
the clashes have followed a pattern of massive nighttime 
shelling followed by daytime lulls apparently to give people a 
chance to buy food and other supplies 
denise khater an executive secretary in the christian suburb of 
baabda saidit was raining rockets at baabda several times i 
thought the building would collapse on the basement where we were 
hiding 
bank employee elie badran said christian east beiruts densely 
populated ashrafiyeh district also came under ferocious bombardment 
overnight but that most people had taken refuge in basements and 
bomb shelters before dusk 
weve installed a television set in the basement of our 
building we also have beds mattresses and blankets in addition to 
a variety of medicines first aid equipment and water supply he 
said 
the artillery duel escalated sharply friday evening after aoun 
rejected a truce with the syrian and jumblatts forces and vowed to 
drive the syrian army out of lebanon even if the fighting destroys 
beirut 
the confrontation broke out earlier this month after aoun 
decided to blockade illegal militiarun ports along lebanons 
coast the militias have been skimming tax revenues the government 
would otherwise collect there

a woman who claims she shot her 
82yearold mother eight times in the head and neck in a 
homicidal compulsion induced by the drug halcion has filed a 
21 million federal lawsuit against upjohn corp 
ilo marie grundberg says she was suffering a severe case of 
halcion intoxication when she shot and killed mildred coats on 
june 19 1988 according to the lawsuit filed in us district 
court on friday 
grundberg who once shared a home with her mother in the 
southern utah city of hurricane faced a seconddegree murder 
charge until a judge dismissed the case ruling the killing was the 
result of her addiction to the prescription drug used in treating 
insomnia 
grundberg is joined in the lawsuit by her daughter janice gray 
who both now live in yucaipa calif gray represents coats estate 
the lawsuit contends that upjohn of kalamazoo mich knew or 
should have known that halcion known generically as triazolam 
could cause intoxication in the user even when properly prescribed 
and used according to the advice and directions supplied by the 
defendant 
among the possible reactions the lawsuit claims are severe 
depression hallucinations psychosis organic brain damage 
bizarre and profoundly disturbed behavior amnesia and other side 
effects which if not promptly discovered and treated can lead 
to personal injury and death to the user and others in contact with 
the user 
upjohn spokeswoman nancy heitzman declined to discuss the 
lawsuit friday saying company policy prohibited comment on pending 
litigation 
grundberg 57 admitted that on the night of her mothers death 
she slipped a birthday card into the sleeping womans hand the 
next day was her 83rd birthday then shot her with a 22caliber 
revolver 
she then wrote a confession saying she loved her mother but 
killed her to spare her from what she described as troubled 
financial times ahead she then called police 
an investigation however revealed the women were well off 
financially and that coats had signed over all her assets to 
grundberg police said they had no motive for the shooting

nearly two people a day were killed last year in 
drugrelated slayings in the nations largest city making up 
almost 37 percent of the record 1896 homicides police said 
in addition the epidemic of crack a powerful form of cocaine 
was responsible for 1988s record rate of aggravated assaults 
larceny and motor vehicle thefts police said 
i think we have to attribute a significant portion of all 
these increases to crack said assistant chief raymond kelly of 
the departments office of management analysis and planning its 
sweeping the country its been here since 1986 thats when the 
figures started going up dramatically 
officials had acknowledged in december that 1988 was the citys 
most murderous year topping the old record of 1826 people set in 
1981 
the figures were released friday 
in 1988 368 percent of all the homicides committed in the city 
were drug related kelly said and those are only the ones we are 
definitely sure of im sure theres more 
homicides and nonnegligent manslaughters topped the list of 
crimes against people increasing 134 percent in a year from 1672 
to 1896 
the only decline in crime came in the number of reported rapes 
which dropped 27 percent from 3507 in 1987 to 3412 in 1988 
department statisticians do not view that as a significant 
decrease because generally speaking rape cases are 
underreported kelly said

phonesex is safe sex says a group that 
promotes education about aids 
in the age of aids we need to make sure people have access to 
forms of sexual expression which are completely safe said 
benjamin schatz of the national gay rights advocates we cant 
allow conservative moralizing to take precedence over peoples 
lives 
schatzs group has prepared a brief for the san francisco aids 
foundation to be filed today with the us supreme court 
the court is reviewing a federal communications commission 
proposal to ban obscene or indecent commercial messages in 
telephone calls on interstate lines or in the district of columbia 
the calls are carried for a fee on numbers beginning with 900 
prefixes 
there is direct evidence that some people consciously use 
dialaporn as a form of safe sex instead of engaging in sexual 
contact involving the exchange of bodily fluids the foundation 
said in the papers 
records of the foundations safesex workshops with homosexual 
men reveal that participants named phone sex as a safesex 
substitute in every recorded session 
schatz acknowledged that telephone sex does not always prevent 
unsafe sex and can even encourage it but said the beneficial 
effects outweigh any justification for a ban 
it would be naive to say that this is something everybody 
responds to in a socially responsible manner he said but 
watching television can encourage unsafe sex and thats no reason 
to ban television 
the aids foundation a nonprofit educational and service 
organization argued in its supreme court brief that even obscene 
phone messages that might otherwise be banned should be 
constitutionally protected to the extent that they may divert 
some individuals from lifethreatening behavior 
look at gay newspapers you will find pages of ads for phone 
sex lines where years ago the ads would have been for 
bathhouses schatz said friday 
the bathhouses which have been shut down in san francisco were 
viewed by health officials as major sources of transmission of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in anonymous sexual contacts 
between male homosexuals 
aids an affliction in which a virus attacks the bodys immune 
system leaves victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers it is most often transmitted through sexual contact 
mostly between homosexual males 
the brief argued that telephone sex not only serves as an 
alternative to sexual contacts that can transmit aids but also can 
serve as a form of education to make safe sex more attractive 
a study presented by us public health researchers at a recent 
international conference on aids in stockholm found that sexually 
explicit materials presenting safer sex behavior in an 
affirmatively erotic manner was the most sucessful means of 
motivating persons to change from highrisk to low or norisk 
behavior said the brief signed by schatz and lead attorney 
leonard graff 
heterosexual as well as homosexual phone mssages should be 
allowed because both groups can get aids from sexual contacts 
schatz said 
he said the foundation has no objection to regulation of 
dialaporn such as blocking of the service by individual 
households or restrictions on access to children

radio talkshow listeners from black and white 
audiences are getting a chance to sound off together on special 
programs aimed at easing racial tensions before chicagos upcoming 
mayoral election 
wbbmam a 50000watt station with a 75 percent white audience 
plans to join with wgciam a 5000watt station with a mostly 
black audience to broadcast a fourhour callin talk show april 3 
on the eve of the election 
chicago is a very segregated city and in many cases 
chicagos radio stations are also segregated said chris berry 
executive editor of wbbm the allnews am station that came up with 
the idea 
race has been part of the campaign in that we have had some 
white and some black candidates running he added friday it 
looked to us as though voting would probably go along racial 
lines 
the candidates are democratic frontrunner richard m daley 
republican edward vrdolyak and alderman timothy evans a democrat 
running on a thirdparty slate daley and vrdolyak are white evans 
is black 
voting in the feb 28 mayoral primary was divided largely along 
racial lines when daley defeated mayor eugene sawyer for the 
democratic nomination becoming the first white candidate to defeat 
a black incumbent mayor in a major us city 
chicagos votingage population is about 49 percent white 42 
percent black 7 percent hispanic and the remainder asian and other 
groups 
after the wbbmwgci plan was announced two weeks ago two other 
stations joined for a similar program that aired wednesday 
blackoriented wvonam teamed with public station wbezfm for a 
morning show on politics social life and race and agreed to do it 
again the day after the election 
i dont think we got into anything all that controversial 
wbez announcer ken davis said of wednesdays program we were all 
on our best behavior 
wbezs audience is 92 percent white and wvons is 89 percent 
black according to the chicago tribune and their combined show 
reached an estimated 450000 listeners 
for the electioneve show produced by wbbmwgci the candidates 
themselves have been invited daley is expected to send a 
representative and vrdolyak and evans are expected to participate 
berry said 
also about 50 business and community leaders are being invited 
to sit in as a studio audience and be potential participants berry 
said 
this is an opportunity for our listeners and their listeners 
to talk with people they might not normally have the opportunity to 
talk with and to discuss the issues facing this city berry added 
darlene black marketing director for wgci said its a 
landmark thing to happen for two stations who are normally 
competitors to come together for a common cause but thats really 
our main goal 
ms black said the mayoral race has come down in some areas to 
a blackwhite issue and thats one of the things were trying to 
eliminate 
no estimate was available on wgcis usual number of listeners 
but wbbm has a usual evening audience of 387000 adults in the 18 
counties surrounding chicago said spokeswoman barbara diguido

us customs officials have been ordered to 
halt previously approved shipments of more than 400000 
militarystyle assault weapons at the nations borders a newspaper 
reported today 
the treasury departments bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms had already approved the weapons shipments but quickly 
rescinded that approval friday the los angeles times reported 
the order follows the bush administrations announcement earlier 
this month that it was issuing a temporary ban on new permits 
allowing the importation of five types of assault weapons into the 
united states 
among those banned was the ak47 the weapon used earlier this 
year in a massacre of schoolchildren in stockton calif 
william t drake a top official at atf acknowledged in an 
interview with the times that the move to ban previously approved 
weapons shipments would be controversial but he said an internal 
audit detailing the vast extent of imports already authorized had 
persuaded the agency to take the emergency action 
when the moratorium on new permits was announced earlier this 
month federal officials indicated they had no control over permits 
already approved 
however drake said his agency believes it was granted that 
power under the 1968 gun control act which empowered the aft to 
grant licenses authorizing gun imports 
what god giveth god can taketh away he said 
the bureau declined to disclose how many weapons have been 
approved for import but an unidentified customs source told the 
times the number was 420000 
according to the atf 70000 assault rifles have been imported 
into the us in the last three years

tales to enchant children with titles such 
as the white pigeon or locusts in the city line the shelves 
of middle eastern classrooms and homes 
behind their shiny covers and bright pictures lie subtle 
messages of nationhood homeland and a peoples yearning the 
messages of the palestine liberation organization 
these books and others published by dar alfata alarabi the 
arab youth house repeatedly drive home the proclaimed plo 
philosophy on what young palestinians should be taught hope 
ambition and persistence for independence during the struggle 
against zionism and imperialism 
the chairman of the cairobased publishing house nabil shaath 
is an aide to plo chief yasser arafat and a member of the palestine 
national council he and 19 other wealthy palestinians started dar 
alfata in 1974 with 100000 
but hasna mekdashi the companys executive manager denies the 
organization still influences dar alfata the house was guided by 
the plos educational planning department at first she said but 
it is now independent our themes are really about universal 
values mrs mekdashi said noting that many of the little books 
have been translated into english and other languages 
nevertheless the message remains 
in the white pigeon by syrian writer zakaria tamer little 
pigeon ventures out of the nest to discover the world gets lost 
but eventually makes her way home 
after chiding her daughter for leaving mama pigeon recalls that 
she did the same thing as a chick but that her love of home guided 
her back she marvels in a commentary on the palestinian diaspora 
all those who are lost and far away from their homes will be 
guided back to them by their love for their homes 
and the message changes with plo policy shifts 
although the plo recently has taken a conciliatory posture in 
its conflict with israel and says it wants a political solution to 
the middle east crisis early dar alfata publications had a 
militant flavor to them 
the home a brightly colored 1974 pamphlet depicts the 
dwellings of birds animals and fish 
then beside a picture of a tank with a star of david on its 
side it says the residence of the palestinian is occupied by the 
enemy next is a rifle dominating an orangecolored page and 
author tamer concludes how will the palestinian regain his home 
with arms alone 
the publication was distributed at the united nations when 
arafat spoke to the general assembly in 1975 mrs mekdashi said 
shaath said in an interview that the booklet was written 15 
years ago but said if it were written today we would say by arms 
and persuasion 
he laughed now i would say more persuasion than arms 
shaath planned dar alfata soon after a dispute between 
palestinians in jordan and king hussein deteriorated into war in 
september 1970 husseins army drove out arafat and the plos 
guerrilla forces 
soon the publishing house had another experience with arab 
schisms it had to move its headquarters from beirut to cairo in 
1976 when civil war broke out although its main printing 
facilities remain in the battered lebanese capital 
of the houses 260 books and posters 12 are translated into 
english four into swedish and a few into french spanish and 
german the translated works serve mainly ethnic arab communities 
in the united states britain france and australia giving them a 
taste of their ancestors culture 
the publishing house has not shirked from criticizing arab 
divisions and rhetoric 
plantdevouring insects swarm into a town in locusts in the 
city instead of attending to the business of eliminating the 
pests residents spend their time talking about the problem and 
making eloquent speeches critical of the insects the book 
concludes when the locusts occupied the city they did not leave 
it they are still eating the grass the ears of wheat and the 
leaves of the trees 
in the house of white paper dar alfata shows palestinian 
children the benefits of cooperation five pencils draw a house in 
an idyllic setting with a dog cat and crows but a donkey 
intrudes and takes over the house pencils paper animals and 
crows confer and decide to attack 
the pencils rained down blows on the donkey the cat bit the 
donkey the dog bit the donkey and the crows pecked at the 
donkey the book says 
though the donkey brayed and kicked out violently he was

a united airlines jumbo jet bound for 
san francisco with 357 people aboard returned to manila today after 
a piece of one wing peeled off over the pacific ocean 
the boeing 747 landed safely at manilas airport and no serious 
injuries were reported to the passengers or crew of flight 820 
last month the cargo door of a united boeing 747 blew off after 
the craft left honolulu ripping a huge hole in the side of the 
fuselage nine people died when they were sucked out of the hole 
in todays accident passenger jonathan miller of torrance 
calif said the plane began to vibrate after a 10by3foot hole 
appeared in the right wing between the fuselage and the nearest 
flaps 
first i felt a bump then the plane began vibrating said 
miller who was seated near the wing i saw a foot of the 
starboard wing peel off and then other pieces followed you can 
clearly see through the hole 
rob doughty a united spokesman in chicago said a 3by5foot 
portion of a fiberglass panel fell off the wing but he said there 
were other panels beneath it and that the accident did not leave a 
hole in the wing 
its not a hole at all he told the associated press 
fred farrar a spokesman for the federal aviation administration 
in washington said in an interview that the panel was strictly 
there for streamlining he said it was not structurally 
significant and that there was no compromise to the structural 
integrity of the airplane 
doughty did not know how high the plane was flying when the 
accident occurred but miller a 50yearold aircraft products 
engineer said it was probably about 35000 feet above the pacific 
ocean at the time 
witnesses who saw the plane after it returned to ninoy aquino 
international airport said the torn portion was just above the 
flaps near the fuselage security forces kept reporters away from 
the aircraft 
rudy flores the airports supervising air traffic controller 
said the crew discovered a fiberglass section of the wing had torn 
off about 30 minutes after the plane took off from manila 
doughty said the boeing 747100 was delivered to united in nov 
28 1970 he refused to speculate on the cause of the accident but 
he said the age of the plane probably played no role 
its too early to tell what the problem is and to jump to the 
conclusion that it was age of the airplane at his point is 
irrelevant he said 
flores said the pilot informed the airports tower the damage 
was considered minor and emergency assistance would not be needed 
miller said there was very mild panic inside the plane when 
the passengers learned about the torn wing section he said one 
passenger suffered an apparent heart attack 
nobody was hurt flores said in a telephone interview but 
because of the damage the flight has been canceled 
dr edgardo francisco the airport doctor said one passenger 
showed symptoms of a heart attack but recovered after taking 
sedatives 
the plane left manila airport at 1011 am for an intermediate 
stop in tokyo en route to san francisco flores said basso said 
the planes 340 passengers and 17 crew members were safe and would 
be flown on later flights 
in april a crew member was killed and 61 passengers were injured 
when a section of fuselage ripped off a 19yearold aloha airlines 
boeing 737 
that accident over hawaii and other recent structural failures 
have focused public attention on the age of americas airplane 
fleet currently estimated to average about 127 years the us 
aviation industry is studying ways to keep americas aging aircraft 
aloft and avoid structural failure in the future

the rev jesse jackson is sounding an easter 
season call for renewed humanitarian efforts to gain freedom for 
american hostages held in lebanon saying that we should go on 
the offensive the moral offensive 
renewed effort and hope must replace futility jackson said 
its time now to roll the stone away 
nine americans are held hostage in lebanon as are six men from 
other foreign nations longest held is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped on 
march 16 1985 
we are concerned about all of those who are held captive 
whether they are lebanese or french or british of american 
jackson said in an interview on the hostage situation we are 
concerned that a whole nation is held captive to these continued 
shellings and bombings 
in a sense terry and the others are prisoners of war 
anderson had covered jacksons 1984 mission to syria which led 
to the release of a navy lieutenant whose plane was shot down 
during a us raid over lebanon the navy man was held for a month 
then released to jackson anderson himself was seized by gunmen in 
beirut little more than 15 months later 
jackson said it is important that the lebanese moslems holding 
us hostages know that americans are concerned about the 
rebuilding of that country about children in refugee camps about 
bombing and shelling 
we are concerned about that he said so was terry 
we should not take the position that lebanon is a no mans 
land cursed with eternal and perpetual war the black civil 
rights and political leader twice a democratic presidential 
candidate said in the interview he said the united states should 
make clear that it is prepared to help rebuild and restore lebanon 
just as europe was rebuilt after world war ii 
he advanced no new proposals for hostage release efforts but 
urged a return to some that have been tried before saying that the 
armsforhostage deal with iran had undone humanitarian efforts 
that might otherwise have made headway 
two americans were released during the reagan administrations 
armsforhostages dealings with iran 
jackson said that at the time the administration complained 
that citizentocitizen appeals would get in the way of 
government operations then it turned out that government 
operations meant straight swaps of hostages for arms and money 
we want to put the focus again back on the captured as well as 
on our concern about the basic agony of the captors he said 
jackson said he is seeking sponsors and support for an effort to 
reach the captors of american and other hostages through 
advertisements and announcements in newspapers and on radio and 
television in the area 
we have no way of knowing the impact but we do know that they 
are read he said 
jackson said he would make the radio and tv tapes and would sign 
the advertisements 
in lebanon the captors are basically nameless and faceless 
jackson said therefore the appeal has to be a broadbased appeal 
to the religious and political leaders and to others who care 
jackson said he has talked with religious leaders from lebanon 
during the past few weeks and will continue those appeals we 
should not leave our friends in an outofsight outofmind 
position he said 
he also suggested that the united states should seek action on 
its offer to pay reparations to the families of 290 people killed 
when an iran air jetliner was shot down by mistake by a us 
warship in the persian gulf last summer that has been stalled 
because the tehran government has not proposed a system for direct 
payment to the families 
jackson said he would be prepared to return to the middle east 
in the cause of the hostages if he had leads and contacts that 
would indicate it would help 
whenever i make these approaches i always do so with respect 
for our government and whatever plans it may have jackson said 
but i still think that within the law citizens have the right 
and the obligation citizen to citizen church to church to also 
make appeals and approaches 
sometimes theres less hostility to citizens

congress of peoples deputies a new chamber created last year in 
broad electoral reforms championed by president mikhail gorbachev

than 70 years 
about 10000 people chanting slogans and waving posters 
attended the peaceful outdoor rally today in a large parking lot 
next to lenin stadium 
the demonstrators echoing a central theme of yeltsins election 
campaign demanded an end to privileges for the communist party 
elite such as special food stores and chauffeured limousines 
do away with special privileges for politicians and 
bureaucrats said a typical placard that one demonstrator held 
aloft on a ski pole servants of the people should have to stand 
in line said another 
about 5000 people streamed into the parking lot under partly 
cloudy skies before the noon rally and the crowd swelled to more 
than 10000 an hour later forcing police to hold people back from 
a roped off area 
hundreds of police lined the entrance to the parking lot outside 
of the former olympic stadium and scores of officers waited in 
dozens of buses parked nearby around a bend in the road hidden by 
trees 50 military trucks packed with soldiers stood by in the 
event the rally got out of control 
this is what it must have been like in 1917 said a yeltsin 
supporter referring to the year of the communist revolution i 
have not seen anything like it in my lifetime 
rally organizers from three moscow political action groups 
obtained permission for the threehour rally after convincing 
authorities it would be better than having an illegal demonstration 
such as the one sunday in downtown moscow in which thousands of 
yeltsin supporters gathered and marched 
yeltsin is running against yevgeny brakov director of the zil 
auto factory that supplies limousines for the kremlin leadership 
for the right to represent all of moscow in the new congress 
the 58yearold yelstin was ousted as head of the moscow 
communist party gorbachev in november 1987 yeltsin and his 
supporters have accused the party of trying to discredit him with 
critical articles in the official media 
brakov 51 is running a lowkey campaign on the issue of ending 
chronic soviet food shortages i am for a speedy decision on the 
food problem development of food and processing industries he 
said in an article written for the newspaper economic gazette 
yeltsin supporters at the rally said they believed their 
candidate who did not appear at the rally would win the votes of 
5 million of moscows 65 million eligible voters 
about 190 million of the 280 million soviets are eligible to 
vote sunday according to the central election commission soviets 
over 18 years old are eligible to cast ballots except those 
certified as insane voting is not mandatory and ballots will be 
secret the official news agency tass said 
voting precincts ranging in size from 20 to 3000 people will be 
set up throughout the soviet union including at polar research and 
mountain stations as well as on navy ships at sea tass said today 
the 750 seats in the new assembly that will not be contested in 
the election were filled by the communist party and other 
officially sanctioned groups ranging from labor unions to an 
association of stamp collectors 
more than 80 percent of the candidates for the 1500 seats that 
are up for grabs in the election are party members 
in a quarter of sundays races only one candidate is running 
the party has dominated the selection of candidates and will if 
only by mathematics also dominate the assembly after sundays 
balloting 
moreover the new chamber will meet just once a year to pick a 
working legislature thus the party should be able to stack the 
legislature with its own members if it so chooses 
nevertheless the campaign has brought competition and public 
debate of a kind almost impossible to imagine in the pregorbachev 
preperestroika era

between 1892 and 1954 nearly 17 million 
immigrants poured through ellis islands main building many hoping 
to make their mark in the new world now as workers restore the 
gateways faded elegance a conservator is preserving the marks 
some immigrants made on ellis island 
christy cunningham adams an art preservationist from boston 
has spent much of the past three years stripping layers of old 
plaster and paint to find old graffiti 
giuseppe and achille came to the battery the day of the 18th 
of may saturday 1901 one giuseppe or achille wrote in italian 
on a column in what had been a dining hall 
mrs adams wrapped the column in rice paper gauze and resin to 
preserve the surface which was covered with drawings poems and 
signatures 
workers have discovered about 400 square feet of 
graffiticovered surfaces in the course of restoring the main 
building 
restoration work began on the island in 1984 and is expected to 
be completed later this year the ellis island immigration museum 
is scheduled to open in 1990 some examples of graffiti are being 
removed from the wall for display in a gallery 
the main building was designed as a very grand gracious 
elegant receiving place mrs adams said 
from the water the four cupolas on the corner of the building 
create the impression of a floating palace the vaulted ceiling of 
the great hall the secondfloor registry room generates a sense 
of expectation and a hint of the anxiety people may have felt as 
they waited to be processed 
it was a very scary place mrs adams said some of the 
graffiti that we have been able to decipher does reflect that 
panic that despair 
one italian immigrant wrote damned be the day that i left my 
homeland and country 
it tends to be in places either where they were asked to wait 
or where they were detained mrs adams said 
but beyond expressions of anger or frustration the graffiti 
scrawls reflect a far more basic need to tell the world of ones 
existence graffiti arent necessarily a message to anyone but 
the planting sewing your name in time mrs adams said 
so must pietro mecio have thought when he signed his name on 
aug 31 1901 
some left messages or pictures of boats birds people others 
simply put their hand to the wall and drew its outline 
incontestable evidence that they were there 
mrs adams said she uses the same tools to restore graffiti that 
she uses to restore old paintings chemical reactions between lime 
in the walls and sea air have crystallized the plaster so the 
graffiti have been encapsulated in the surface of the wall 
the challenge in restoring graffiti comes in putting the words 
and images in context its just not easy to know when its 
done mrs adams said its new to everybody preservation of 
graffiti 
mrs adams has stripped one section of wall to graffiti she has 
left the black paint and old plaster on the strip of wall above 
that the second band ends abruptly where new plaster starts 
seeing it like this you see all the things the buildings 
been through she says

president bushs new central america policy is 
in large measure a politically mandated repudiation of president 
reagans views and accelerates what has been the slow but steady 
demise of the nicaraguan contras over the past 18 months 
bushs action on friday was tacit acceptance of the notion that 
without bipartisan congressional support no policy can succeed 
as the reagan administration saw it nicaragua was condemned to 
the endless darkness of communist tyranny under the sandinistas 
and military force was the only instrument capable of inducing them 
to moderate their policies 
under the new policy antisandinista rhetoric has been muted 
and the emphasis is on political diplomatic and economic pressure 
on nicaragua as opposed to military force to encourage a 
democratic outcome 
bush knew that if he tried to resurrect the more pugnacious 
reagan policy the democrats wouldnt stand for it 
two years ago the contras were riding high armed with a fresh 
infusion of us aid the rebels were reinfiltrating nicaragua at 
the rate of 100 a day from honduras and staging frequent attacks 
but by 1988 an impatient congress was rejecting further 
military aid for the rebels and reagan had to settle for 
humanitarian aid most of the contras retreated back across the 
border into honduras 
now the focus is on using a new package of humanitarian aid 
45 million per month for the eventual demobilization of the 
contras and their reintegration into nicaragua from the base camps 
in honduras 
under the new approach the bush administration gets the 
benefits of bipartisanship a coming together of republicans and 
democrats perhaps for the first time on the central america issue 
and the prospect of a policy that will be politically sustainable 
if a peaceful democratic nicaragua emerges from the process 
expected to culminate with elections next february bush will earn 
plaudits all around as the man who found a way to tame an issue 
that had festered under his predecessor for eight years 
the big question many conservatives are asking is whether the 
combination of nonmilitary pressures can be enough to make the 
sandinistas do what reagan had said could only be done by military 
force democratize 
reagan in effect said of the sandinista promises to create 
democracy we cant trust them arms for the contras 
bush in effect is replying well maybe they can be trusted 
food but not firearms for the contras but only for a while 
if the sandinistas demonstrate good faith congress could cut 
off even humanitarian aid by november two months before the 
election under the agreement announced friday 
but if the sandinistas are uncooperative bush has the option of 
tightening a 4yearold trade embargo against the sandinistas and 
encouraging aid donors in western europe and japan to withhold 
assistance 
as a final option bush could try to win renewed military aid 
for the contras if he concludes that the sandinistas are 
irretrievably committed to marxist rule and destabilizing 
neighboring governments 
under that scenario the nowdiscarded reagan would seem more 
plausible in retrospect 
in any case just how much the rhetoric has changed from the 
previous administration can be illustrated by citing some quotes 
from a reagan speech in june 1986 the day before a house vote on a 
100 million aid package for the contras 
for over 200 years reagan said the security of the 
united states has depended on the safety of unthreatened borders 
north and south do we want to be the first elected leaders in us 
history to put our borders at risk 
the aid package was approved but that kind of talk is all but 
forgotten nowadays 
the view of secretary of state james a baker iii outlined 
friday was that reagans policy foundered because he couldnt get 
congress to go along on a consistent basis 
i think we all have to admit that the policy basically failed 
to some extent because we were not united we had an executive 
branch going in one direction and a legislative branch going in 
another he said

michial patric thompson lost 
his job his home his friends and his confidence after he told 
pentagon officials that his former employer was cheating on a 
defense department contract 
two years later he has found peace and hope for a new life at 
an isolated retreat for whistleblowers tucked into the mountains 
of southeastern west virginia 
i still wake up nights wondering how im going to afford to 
get the kids new shoes or a new pair of pants said the 
unemployed 35yearold father of four 
here at least i can stoke up the wood stove while i wonder 
and not have to worry about my familys safety or look over my 
shoulder every time i go out 
thompsons haven lies at the end of a steep winding dirt road 
best driven in low gear that just happens to be near the 
greenbrier an elegant old resort for the wealthy and 
wellconnected 
the pineshaded 50acre retreat dubbed the whistle stop by 
owner donald r soeken a maryland psychiatric social worker 
provides a respite for those exhausted by the retaliation 
financial loss and stress from revealing fraud or waste in 
government or private industry 
every so often people would call and they were desperate 
said soeken a former whistleblower himself who runs a counseling 
service for whistleblowers in laurel md a washington suburb 
they had no place to go 
he started taking them to his country place here early last year 
thompson was working at the am general plant in mishawaka ind 
in january 1987 when he told government inspectors that documents 
on the militarys hummer general purpose vehicle were being 
falsified to allow the vehicles to move faster along the assembly 
line he claimed workers made it appear that the vehicles wheels 
had been aligned when in fact they had not 
spokesmen for am general a division of ltv aerospace of 
dallas denied the allegations after a company investigation 
thompson said he was fired a short time later the company 
maintains he quit by refusing to accept other job assignments after 
he made his allegations 
no criminal charges have been brought against am general but a 
defense department investigation of thompsons allegations 
continues 
i consider myself to be a patriot thompson said i didnt 
want those boys to be driving defective vehicles and i wanted to 
make sure the taxpayers were getting their moneys worth 
soeken says thompsons experience is representative of the 
ordeal faced by most whistleblowers or ethical resisters as 
soeken prefers to call them 
it can go on for years and sometimes you feel like its never 
going to end said soeken who has a doctorate in human 
development and has counseled well over 100 whistleblowers 
he was caught in a fear network up there first you lose your 
job then your friends stop talking to you then you begin to ask 
yourself whether you did the right thing 
you begin to ask yourself was it worth it 
most whistleblowers think it was according to research done by 
soeken and his wife karen a statistician and a faculty member at 
the university of maryland school of nursing 
the couples survey of 90 whistleblowers found that most win 
little more than a boost in their selfrespect but many the 
soekens said would do it again 
more than half of those surveyed said they had been harassed by 
coworkers 20 percent lost their jobs 10 percent attempted 
suicide 17 percent lost their homes and 15 percent had been 
divorced 
these people are acting out of their consciences soeken 
said but society sees them as tattletales and it carries the 
same stigma as it did when we were kids 
people say we cant trust you we dont want you as a 
friend people use fourletter words to describe them they become 
outsiders theyre no longer company men who can be controlled 
thompson his wife robyn and their children have been at the 
whistle stop since january living on a 413 monthly public 
assistance check and contributions from friends family and 
strangers he does odd jobs around the retreat to help pay for his 
stay 
thompson was paid about 25000 annually counting overtime 
while working at am general he has averaged 7000 a year or less 
since he went public with his allegations 
i sure wouldnt do it again the way i did it thompson said 
id try and stay anonymous next time

theres a joke about the vice presidency that 
dan quayle likes to repeat a man had two sons one went away to 
sea and the other became vice president and neither one was ever 
heard of again 
the joke underscores the relief in many gop quarters that so 
far quayle has avoided the kind of blunders that would embarrass 
president bush 
the traditional bane of the vice presidency is to be a 
peripheral cheerleader for the administration while the president 
and cabinet members corner the limelight but for quayle who slid 
into the vice presidency on a wave of low expectations negative 
press and attacks on everything from his intelligence to his 
wealthy background life out of the limelight is a relief 
the critical headlines behind him for now quayle quietly goes 
about his work settling into his new job amid generally positive 
reviews for showing competence in his assignments 
he has asserted himself within the administration as a voice for 
conservative republicans become a soughtafter speaker on the gop 
lecture circuit and traveled to latin america in the bush 
administrations first foreign trip 
with the exception of a particularly strident attack on senate 
democrats for rejecting bushs defense secretary nominee john 
tower in language that cut against bushs own conciliatory 
remarks quayles statements have been fairly humdrum news 
he often attends the presidents morning intelligence briefings 
and participates in toplevel advisory meetings 
administration officials describe quayle as more than a passive 
participant in these sessions and say he weighs in on a variety of 
subjects 
bushs chief of staff john sununu is said to have regard for 
quayle and seek out his opinion especially on matters involving 
congress where quayle served as a senator and representative from 
indiana and on foreign policy sununu has informed his staff that 
quayle is to be included as an active contributor on policy matters 
quayle himself says the most rewarding aspect of his new job is 
a close relationship with bush developed in almost daily visits to 
the oval office 
in an interview with the associated press quayle described it 
as a comfortable warm relationship 
he has worked to show only the most supportive public face for 
bush modeling himself after bushs own loyal vice presidency under 
reagan 
should he ever disagree with a bush decision quayle said 
recently he would never make his opposition public 
in the interview quayle said the hardest part of being vice 
president is balancing his work with time for his family 
the quality time has been abbreviated he said theres no 
such thing as going to mcdonalds with the kids 
still the 42yearold father of three young children has managed 
to duck out to a video store with his son and take the family out 
for a ribs dinner on occasion 
i think he has tried to stay out of the headlines and become 
temperate and not become a lightning rod for democrats said 
stuart eizenstat former domestic policy adviser to president 
carter eizenstat gave quayle an overall positive report card along 
those lines with the exception of the tower speech in which quayle 
strayed from bushs congressional fence mending 
quayle defended the speech in which he accused his former 
senate colleagues of tactics recalling the virulent anticommunist 
crusade of the late sen joseph mccarthy in the 1950s 
there are certainly things that a vice president can say and 
do that it would be best for a president not to say and do 
quayle said he said he will continue to do those things in a 
way i think will help the president 
quayles generally good reviews are amplified against the 
campaign background of critical press probes into his national 
guard service his mediocre academic record his wealthy fathers 
influence and his lowkey performance in congress 
hes benefiting tremendously from low expectations people 
expecting this cartoon character that the media has created said 
gop political consultant roger stone 
eizenstat contended that quayle has wiped away a lot of the 
image of immaturity that developed in part from bush campaign 
operatives efforts to package him 
former white house political director mitch daniels who was 
enlisted by the bush camp as one of quayles campaign handlers 
said he felt all along that quayle would exceed expectations 
because of the coverage last fall what has surprised me is how 
quickly hes been able to establish himself 
its both because the president has been eager to see him 
rehabilitated and because he stood out somewhat from the rest of 
the administration daniels said he characterized the new 
administration as getting off to a slow start making quayle sort 
of pastel against a beige background 
quayles specific duties are to chair bushs new council on 
competitiveness and his national space council the news has been 
quiet so far on both fronts 
he also has shown an interest in making latin america a 
specialty interest after his threeday swing through venezuela and 
el salvador while there he delivered a tough prohuman rights 
message to the salvadoran military and extended the bush 
administrations hand to a number of heads of state who gathered 
for the venezuelan inauguration 
on the speakers circuit quayle has been drumming up support 
for the administration with conservativetoned addresses to such 
groups as religious broadcasters and cubanamericans 
in the process he is solidifying his base with the right said 
david keene chairman of the american conservative union 
the conservatives are gradually becoming less enamored with 
george bush keene said quayle begins to look better as he 
makes some attempt to reach out to them

premier li pengs call last week for huge 
spending cuts to slow the overheated economy has angered local 
officials highlighting centuriesold tension between chinas 
central government and its unruly provinces 
beijing demands austerity thats fine the provinces say but 
not at their expense 
chinas local governments have taken swipes at lis plan to slow 
exaggerated industrial growth and high inflation through 
recentralization of the economy under a government less generous 
with handouts 
first to speak out was the governor of guangdong chinas most 
prosperous province located next to hong kong about 1200 miles 
from beijing 
guangdong should be an exception ye xuanping thursday told 
delegates to the national peoples congress chinas legislature 
we are a special province and we should be treated differently 
next came chen xitong mayor of the capital beijing which is 
treated as a province by the chinese government 
beijing must be protected must be protected chen boomed 
during a session with delegates from beijing after all china 
only has one capital 
officials from guizhou qinghai and yunnan all poorer 
provinces followed suit 
look at all these big buildings in beijing said one 
delegate from yunnan a rural province in chinas mountainous 
southwest stop one of those hotels and youd help thousands of 
my people in the countryside 
luo pingyi a delegate from guizhou in the south said austerity 
measures should not be applied to us who are falling behind 
local governments have clashed with chinas central government 
since the communist revolution in 1949 and for centuries before 
one dynasty the sung actually abolished provinces in the 10th 
century and put all officials under the emperors direct control 
the communist government regularly rotates its governors to avoid 
the development of independent power bases 
on monday premier li opened chinas annual legislative session 
with a call for belttightening and thrift 
chinas overheated industrial sector grew 17 percent last year 
inflation is running at 36 percent the highest since the communist 
victory in 1949 
li said local governments must abandon selfishness 
all localities departments and units should take the 
interests of the whole into account and firmly subordinate their 
local interests li said 
a day later vicepremier yao yilin and minister of finance wang 
bingqian weighed in with some specifics increased taxes and cuts 
in funding for enterprises operating outside the centralized state 
plan greater central control of loans a stronger national bank 
in addition provinces and cities which recently gained the 
right to trade with and borrow money from foreign countries saw 
those rights diminished poorer provinces were told to expect less 
help 
but many provinces arent so sure they want the recentralization 
of the countrys economy 
richer provinces benefited from the recent trend toward 
decentralizing economic decisionmaking and the accompanying new 
political power 
counties got rich opening mines and starting little factories 
cities prospered cutting deals with foreign countries and trading 
among themselves 
poorer provinces still need state subsidies and aid and their 
delegates said austerity will have little effect on prosperous 
coastal provinces 
to the coastal areas the retrenchment is like taking a knife 
to the tale of an ox said huanjue cailang a delegate from 
impoverished qinghai but to us poor districts its like hitting 
him on the head with a brick

here is the text of a statement from president 
bush issued by the white house on saturday in honor of the 1979 
middle east peace agreement 
ten years ago representatives of egypt and israel met here in 
the presence of american witnesses to sign a treaty that 
transformed the political map of the middle east of course i 
speak of the peace agreement ending over 30 years of war between 
egypt and israel 
the treaty was the product of vision statesmanship courage and 
persistence on the part of all the participants anwar sadats 
historic trip to jerusalem illustrated dramatically how one man 
could raise his nation above the hostility and isolation the arab 
states showed israel for over three decades menachem begins 
response demonstrated the courage to overcome fears and obstacles 
in pursuit of a larger goal and the american team pursued every 
lead toward peace and contributed critically to the process begun 
by previous administrations 
recognizing the historic achievement of 10 years ago however 
turns our minds toward the still more daunting challenges ahead if 
we wish truly to honor those whose bravery and hard work made 
possible the peace treaty we need to complete the work they began 
we must commit ourselves as anwar sadat and menachem begin did to 
fresh thinking 
the middle east today remains a dangerous and volatile area 
deep seated hostilities and legitimate security concerns frustrate 
efforts to expand the peace and yet there are hopeful signs the 
desire to find a peaceful settlement is increasingly widespread 
there is also a growing understanding that a settlement can be 
reached which both satisfies israels security needs and addresses 
the legitimate political rights of the palestinians what worked in 
the egyptisrael peace treaty negotiations based on us security 
council resolutions 242 and 338 can work as the basis for a wider 
lasting peace 
this administration is committed to this goal we must be 
patient but we must never stop trying the search for peace will 
continue to animate our discussions with good friends from egypt 
isarel and other middle eastern countries as they visit here or as 
we visit there the best way to do honor to those who gave us the 
treaty of peace with israel and egypt would be to bring peace to 
the entire middle east

travel for a moment the rocky road of the 
prosecution at oliver norths irancontra trial in an attempt to 
convict him you have to rely on witnesses who are hostile to your 
case and sympathetic to the defense 
so far the prosecutions witnesses have included 
nicaraguan contra leader adolfo calero who tells the jury 
north cant possibly have stolen 4300 in travelers checks and 
describes the fired white house aide as sort of a savior to the 
guerrillas 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane who 
repeatedly states during five days of testimony that hes to blame 
for crimes north is accused of committing 
beer magnate joseph coors in front of the jury coors walks 
over to north and warmly shakes his hand 
what will the jurors remember the handshake or that coors 
acknowledged under questioning that north had given him the number 
of a swiss bank account to contribute money to the contras 
then theres the tearladen testimony of norths former 
secretary fawn hall who praised north as a tireless patriot and 
then began crying uncontrollably 
she bristled at being a prosecution witness she said instead 
that she was a witness for the truth 
in order to make some of the witnesses stick to the truth 
prosecutors were forced to confront them with earlier testimony 
they had given 
excia operative glenn robinette repeatedly denied that an 
attempted coverup was designed to protect north prosecutor john 
keker confronted robinette with his grand jury testimony from two 
years ago robinette said then that the coverup was an attempt to 
help north who had accepted a 13800 home security system free of 
charge 
facing up to his earlier remarks robinette reluctantly agreed 
that yes he had been trying to protect north as well as 
irancontra codefendant richard secord who had paid for norths 
security system 
mcfarlanes testimony gave the prosecution fits even the judge 
in the case described it as equivocal and confusing 
under questioning by north lawyer brendan sullivan mcfarlane 
said north prepared just two innocuous paragraphs of a sept 5 
1985 letter to congress other portions of the letter denied the 
national security council staff was involved in fundraising for 
the contras or offering them tactical advice 
mcfarlane also testified about a key draft of a sept 12 1985 
letter to congress containing similar denials mcfarlane first 
testified he thought north prepared it then said he wasnt sure 
there has been strong testimony for the prosecution from former 
house intelligence committee chairman lee hamilton and intelligence 
committee staff director thomas latimer 
they testified of norths alleged statements at an aug 6 1986 
meeting with the intelligence committee denying he had recently 
seen a retired army general who helped the contras or that he had 
much to do with robert owen 
north actually met constantly with owen who served as his 
courier to the contras and had several contacts with retired army 
gen john singlaub in 1986 
the problem with the charge from the prosecutions point of 
view theres no transcript of the meeting just sketchy notes 
taken by latimer the intelligence committee was able to arrange 
the session only on condition that no transcript be kept 
as the prosecutions case draws to a close this week the north 
trial will focus on thenattorney general edwin meese iiis weekend 
inquiry in november 1986 which uncovered the diversion of funds to 
the contras 
no transcript was kept of that inquiry either the prosecution 
will rely on notes taken by meese aides chuck cooper and john 
richardson and call on all three men to recount events that 
happened 2 years ago 
their testimony relates to charges that north lied to meese by 
denying the national security council was involved in the diversion 
and by asserting that israel determined how much would go to the 
contras from the iran arms sales

jack fisher broke a record saturday as the 
person to live longest on an electric blood pump to help his ailing 
heart more than anything though the 46yearold bond salesman 
hopes for a transplant 
its not a record i want to break he said grinning 
but i dont mind being a medical pioneer fisher said 
relaxing in his hospital room with his wife edie 39 and four of 
their five daughters the girls arrived thursday from the familys 
home in rumson nj to spend the easter weekend with their father 
surgeons at presbyterianuniversity hospital of pittsburgh 
implanted a novacor left ventricular assist device into a dying 
fisher in an operation that ended dec 9 saturday was his 107th 
day with the device while awaiting a transplant 
he had been diagnosed 3 years earlier with cardiomyopathy a 
disease of unknown origin that damages heart muscle 
i think the toughest part psychologically is knowing that in 
order for you to live you have to take something a heart from 
somebody else even though you know the person cant use it he 
said 
the 1pound polyurethane pump was implanted behind the muscle 
of the front abdominal wall as a temporary means of helping the 
left ventricle which does 85 percent of the hearts work 
unlike the jarvik and other total artificial hearts the novacor 
and other assist devices do not require removing the patients own 
diseased heart they are intended to keep people alive while 
awaiting transplants although eventually a longterm device may be 
developed 
the novacor is the only one of the devices to be driven by 
electricity making it less bulky than the airdriven models 
a heartassist device driven by electricity rather than 
compressed air allows the patient awaiting a transplant more 
mobility and reduces the risk of infection said dr peer portner 
president of the californiabased novacor division of baxter 
healthcare corp 
thirteenyearold alison also has mixed emotions about her 
fathers feat 
its kind of funny to think of my dad breaking a record i 
mean i thought it would be a different record that hed break not 
this one she said im upset that hes sick and everything 
but im happy hes alive 
a tube protruding from fishers abdomen carries electrical wires 
that feed into a tiny white box on his lap the box in turn is 
connected by 20 feet of cable to a 440pound console and computer 
that control the pump and monitor his heart rhythm a technician 
pushes the equipment beside him on his daily strolls down hospital 
hallways 
ever present is the loud constant click of the pump as it 
distributes blood through fishers body the noise doesnt bother 
him and the pump is painless 
if this stops clicking im in trouble he said 
dr robert kormos one of his surgeons says its hard to say 
how long the novacor pump could sustain fisher 
its been essentially working faultlessly kormos said 
since the first novacor implant in 1984 at stanford university 
41 of the pumps have been used on people awaiting transplantation 
portner said 
eighteen of the 41 patients went on to receive human hearts and 
were alive as of friday portner said of the remaining 23 fisher 
and three others were still on the device 15 died while on the 
novacor and four died after getting a transplant 
until saturday the record for the most time on a leftventrical 
assist device was 106 days set in january by a 64yearold patient 
at methodist hospital in houston who spent that long on a novacor 
before receiving a human heart the transplant was not successful 
and he died three days later 
the survival record for a total artificial heart is much longer 
william schroeder of jasper ind lived 620 days on one before he 
died in august 1986 but artificial heart patients have all had a 
variety of complications and use of the devices as permanent 
replacements for diseased hearts has been largely suspended 
more than 1200 americans are awaiting heart transplants 
obviously theres a great need to increase as much as 
possible the number of heart donors available portner said 
the only alternative for all those patients is a mechanical 
device 
fisher on leave since january 1988 from shearson lehman 
brothers in new york says he is confident hell pull through a 
transplant once a suitable donor heart is found 
he doesnt sit around worrying when his day will come 
you dont have any control over it theres nothing i can 
do he said shrugging these guys already took care of me 
once i say theyre going to take care of me again 
hes always been one to fight the odds his wife agreed 
hes already proven that here

nearly four out of five us atomic reactors 
have failed to complete sweeping safety changes required following 
the 1979 accident at three mile island nuclear regulatory 
commission records show 
rep edward j markey dmass a nrc critic who requested the 
documents said the data shows that we may be as vulnerable to a 
meltdown in the 21st century as we were in 1979 
only 24 of the nations 112 licensed commercial reactors have 
installed all 149 changes outlined in the three mile island action 
plan drafted in the wake of the nations worst commercial nuclear 
accident the pennsylvania plant suffered a partial core meltdown 
10 years ago tuesday 
of the 88 reactors not in compliance 54 do not plan to complete 
all the safety changes by the end of this year and several will not 
finish until well into the 1990s markey said 
while some of the safety requirements were minor others had 
been labeled top priority by the nrc and given deadlines that have 
long passed notably in the case of some control room and 
instrument improvements 
nrc officials defended their performance saying reactors have 
met 975 percent of the posttmi changes markey rejected that 
argument 
nuclear power isnt horseshoes he said the difference 
between coming close and getting the job done can mean the 
difference between safety and catastrophe 
thomas murley director of nuclear reactor regulation conceded 
the record could be better on the safety changes 
when you look back at 10 years its hard for me to justify 
it murley said but we have to make safety judgments all the 
time were satisfied that we can operate the plants safely 
murley said part of the problem was putting too many 
requirements on the nuclear industry in the wake of three mile 
island and then not giving utilities enough time to implement the 
changes the changes mandated by the three mile island report cost 
each plant an average of 50 million he said 
we were overly optimistic murley said in an interview 
friday we did not properly estimate the amount of work that it 
was going to take the plants he also said if the nrc had to go 
through this again we would be more discriminating on what is 
required i think we laid too much on the industry not all the 
requirements are absolutely necessary 
nevertheless murley said he believes a halfdozen requirements 
pointed out by markey are important and he vowed to pressure the 
industry to complete those changes 
we are going to turn the heat up and require that these will 
be completed he said we want to know why its not done 
the nrc documents showed that 
twentythree reactors have failed to install display consoles 
to help reactor operators more quickly determine a plants safety 
status that had been designated a top priority by the nrc 
following three mile island and given a jan 1 1982 deadline 
thirteen reactors have not installed instruments specifically 
to detect core cooling a requirement that also was given a top 
priority by the agency the nrcimposed deadline was jan 1 1981 
nine reactors have failed to install instruments to tell 
operators about the conditions inside the containment vessels the 
jan 1 1980 deadline is almost a decade old this too received 
nrcs top priority designation 
despite a jan 1 1983 deadline 63 reactors still have not 
conducted a detailed review of their control room designs to 
determine if they are sufficient for operators to cope with an 
accident 
eleven reactors have not tested and analyzed reactor coolant 
valves and pipes to make sure the equipment is qualified for the 
full range of operating and accident conditions the deadline for 
this priorityone requirement was july 1 1981 
five reactors have failed to establish an emergency operations 
center to coordinate evacuations and emergency operations in case 
of an accident the deadline was jan 1 1981 
markey said 25 reactors were licensed and permitted to operate 
following the pennsylvania accident without meeting all the 
posttmi requirements and nine others have restarted or may soon 
restart without meeting all the standards 
murley said no plants have ever been fined or shut down for not 
meeting the requirements 
markey in a letter to nrc chairman lando w zech jr lambasted 
the commissions actions on the regulations which stem from a 
presidential commissions recommendations 
the tmi action plan was a major test of the commitment of the 
nrc to public health and safety the congressman said it is a 
test which the nrc has clearly failed 
murley however defended the nrc saying the commission has 
made plants substantially safer since three mile island and that 
is showing up in all the performance indicators we see everything 
is turning in the right direction were confident weve done the 
right thing 
the nations most troubled plants generally had the most 
posttmi requirements that have gone unmet the nrc documents 
showed 
each of the three browns ferry plants in alabama have not 
complied with 22 separate requirements including five of the six 
listed by markey 
san onofre i in california failed to meet 10 of the regulations 
and the pilgrim plant in massachusetts the shoreham plant on long 
island and millstone i in connecticut each failed to meet eight 
reglations

a 13yearold girl let two boyfriends 
into her home so they could kill her father who was strangled 
stabbed and beaten on the head with a fireplace poker police said 
michelle say was taken into custody friday in connection with 
tuesdays death of ronnie edward say 47 officers already had 
arrested two boys who say reportedly had not wanted around his 
daughter 
ironically say who recently was divorced had moved to manteca 
with his daughter in hopes of avoiding urban crime in the san 
francisco bay area 75 miles west 
witnesses told investigators that michelle let the boys into her 
home before she went to school where she was a seventh grade 
student 
she knew when she left the house that they were going to kill 
him capt charles halford said 
a girlfriend reported that the two boys met her and michelle in 
a park tuesday evening and made statements about the slaying 
michelle then returned home and found her fathers body in a pool 
of blood in the bathroom 
what is unusual about this one is the age of the defendants 
and the brutality of the crime halford said he was beaten 
repeatedly with fireplace tools he was strangled stabbed and 
beaten the autopsy shows he could have died from all three 
berto talaveras 15 and his cousin juan valdez 13 were 
charged with attacking say when he returned home from work a 
juvenile court judge officially made their names public despite 
their ages because the names already had been published in two 
newspapers 
despite their youth both boys outweighed say state department 
of motor vehicles records describe the victim as 5foot3 125 
pounds police said the boys weighed between 160 and 170 pounds 
each 
judge duane martin also allowed reporters and news photographers 
into juvenile court for fridays arraignment of talaveras and 
valdez an unusual action because most juvenile court proceedings 
are kept secret martin said he had the legal discretion under 
california law to open the proceedings to the public because of the 
crimes heinous nature 
separate public defenders were appointed to represent each boy 
and the arraignment was continued until april 13 the defendants 
cannot be tried as adults because they are under 16 so the maximum 
penalty they can face is sentencing to the california youth 
authority until age 25 the judge said 
max valdez brother of defendant juan valdez was quoted in the 
modesto bee as implicating michelle say or micke as he called her 
micke was in on it max valdez told the newspaper micke 
always hated her father she wanted him dead 
the newspaper said michelle dated juan valdez after the says 
moved to manteca last september and was dating talaveras at the 
time of her fathers death 
talaveras was expelled from manteca high school last year said 
district spokesman william whiteside he refused to reveal the 
reason

a panel ripped off the right wing of 
a united airlines jumbo jet over the pacific ocean on saturday but 
the plane returned safely to manila and none of the 357 people 
aboard was injured 
the boeing 747 landed at ninoy aquino international airport 
about an hour after departing for tokyo and san francisco 
the accident did not affect the planes ability to fly the 
airline and the us federal aviation administration said 
last month the cargo door of a united boeing 747 blew off after 
the plane left honolulu for auckland new zealand ripping a huge 
hole in the side of the fuselage nine people died when they were 
sucked out of the hole 
in april 1988 a crew member was killed and 61 passengers were 
injured when a section of fuselage ripped off a 19yearold aloha 
airlines boeing 737 
these accidents and other recent structural failures have 
focused the attention of the us aviation industry and the public 
on the age of americas airplane fleet estimated to average about 
127 years 
the plane involved saturday was delivered to united more than 18 
years ago but an airline spokesman said he doubted its age was a 
factor in the accident 
passenger jonathan miller a 50yearold aircraft engineer from 
torrance calif said the plane began to vibrate after a 
10footby3foot strip of the right wing blew off above the flaps 
near the fuselage 
first i felt a bump then the plane began vibrating said 
miller who was seated near the wing i saw a foot of the 
starboard wing peel off and then other pieces followed you can 
clearly see through the hole 
but rob doughty a united spokesman in chicago said the portion 
of a fiberglass panel that fell off was only five feet long and 
three feet wide 
he said there were other panels beneath it and that the accident 
did not leave a hole in the wing its not a hole at all he 
said in an interview 
fred farrar an faa spokesman in washington told the associated 
press the panel that flew off was strictly there for 
streamlining 
he said it was not structurally significant and that there 
was no compromise to the structural integrity of the airplane 
doughty did not know how high the plane was flying when the 
accident occurred but miller said it was probably about 35000 
feet above the pacific ocean at the time miller said there was 
very mild panic inside the craft when the passengers learned 
about the torn wing section 
maria rowena pizarro a filipino passenger traveling to chicago 
said she felt the plane vibrating but assumed it was wind 
turbulence i knew something was wrong when we saw some of the 
passengers seated near the wings frantically waving at the 
stewardesses and pointing at the planes wings she said 
mrs pizarro said a crew member emerged from the cockpit looked 
at the wing and announced the plane was returning to manila 
we were assured by the crew that everything was ok she 
said and since we were not instructed to take any emergency 
procedures i knew we were safe 
rudy flores supervising air traffic controller at manilas 
airport said the crew discovered a fiberglass section of the wing 
tore off about 30 minutes after the plane took off from manila 
flores said the pilot radioed the airports tower that the 
damage was considered minor and emergency assistance would not be 
needed 
nobody was hurt flores said in a telephone interview but 
because of the damage the flight has been canceled 
dr edgardo francisco the airport doctor said one passenger 
showed symptoms of a heart attack but recovered after taking 
sedatives 
a united official in the philippines said the planes 340 
passengers and 17 crew members would be flown from manila on sunday 
doughty said the boeing 747100 was delivered to united in nov 
28 1970 its too early to tell what the problem is and to jump 
to the conclusion that it was age of the airplane at his point is 
irrelevant he said

arab and israeli reports 
the army confirmed four people were dead and nine wounded 
it said two palestinians were killed in clashes with soldiers in 
the occupied gaza strip the bodies of two others found in gaza 
were apparently killed after being suspected of collaborating with 
israel arab reports and israeli media said

have been killed in the 15monthold uprising against israeli rule 
including 60 suspected arab collaborators eighteen israelis also 
have died 
also saturday about 60 israeli peace activists including three 
rabbis traveled to the west bank town of beit sahour where they 
discussed peace with dozens of palestinians over plates of chicken 
and salad witnesses said 
the activists of the peace now movement said they sought to 
prove dialogue between israelis and palestinians is possible when 
the government and the army do not interfere

as the reagan administration came to an end 
dan howard figured he was out of a job then it began to look like 
he wasnt now hes been told he is again but he doesnt know how 
soon 
howard assistant secretary of defense for public affairs finds 
himself in an extreme example of the limbo in which some reagan 
appointees are caught by president bushs failure to act quickly in 
filling subcabinet level jobs 
howard doesnt blame the president or the pentagon saying any 
new secretary of defense must be able to select his own spokeman 
but he agrees he has been on a roller coaster nonetheless 
the situation is taking a toll on the nerves of the employees 
and the efficiency of government departments say some of those 
affected and some outside experts 
so far with very few people on board things are not yet 
running let alone humming said robert ortner under secretary 
of commerce for economic affairs who is leaving office after 
nearly eight years 
i think it does have a kind of chilling effect on 
productivity said ben burdetsky dean of business administration 
at george washington university and an expert in personnel 
management 
it affects not only the political people but the nonpolitical 
people said burdetsky these people just dont know what the 
boss wants to be done the longer it goes on the worse it is and 
you get a kind of stagnation 
although bush is taking longer than most recent presidents to 
fill the positions some observers and participants play down the 
impact of the delay 
james n mosel a george washington university psychology 
professor whose specialties include the study of worker motivation 
said if i were doing it i wouldnt feel awkward about it id 
be focusing on the future rather than trying to ease the pains of 
the past 
its just unusual in that folks arent used to it said 
stephen hess a senior fellow in governmental studies at the 
brookings institution and a former eisenhower and nixon white house 
aide 
bush is the first president to succeed a predecessor of the same 
party since herbert hoover took over from calvin coolidge in 1929 
bush wanted to take advantage of that and he thought that 
gave him the luxury of time said hess 
when hoover was elected there were fewer positions to fill and 
more time to fill them since the incoming president didnt take 
office until march 4 
two leading hoover scholars george nash and vaughn davis 
bornet both said they were aware of no delay in filling vacancies 
in the hoover administration 
in this administration burdetsky said there is certainly a 
lot of anxiety i have chatted with a few people and they are just 
biting their nails waiting to see what is going to happen 
howard was named the pentagons chief spokesman heading a staff 
of about 400 when frank c carlucci took over as secretary of 
defense in november 1987 although he made no secret that he would 
like to stay on howard was telling friends in december that he 
expected to be leaving 
during the course of the bruising fight over bushs nomination 
of john g tower to be secretary of defense however howard came 
to towers attention and the two became friends several pentagon 
insiders said howard was going to keep his job after all if tower 
was confirmed 
with towers rejection and the confirmation of richard cheney in 
his place howard now has been told that hes out of a job but has 
been asked to stick around for a month or so until his replacement 
is confirmed 
after 20 years in government this was a new experience for 
me he said 
at the commerce department ortner said most people know by now 
whether they will be staying but there is some uncertainty 
morale could be better but morale could always be 
better he said 
planning for the future is difficult ortner said its 
extremely awkward because those of us who are presidential 
appointees have been warned to be very careful about conflicts of 
interest and cautious about outside contacts its very difficult 
to make precise plans while still here therefore many of us leave 
with some future uncertainties 
howard asked how he would advise people working amid such 
uncertainties said just continue to do your job thats the 
key we didnt put things on hold in my shop i was determined that 
wouldnt happen here it wasnt easy but i didnt get so 
distracted that i couldnt do my job

ibms decision to advise employees to stay off 
us airlines because of a hijack warning will be examined very 
carefully by other companies the head of britains largest 
business organization said saturday 
international business machines corp the us computer giant 
said friday it had notified employees to avoid traveling on us 
air carriers from europe and the middle east until the end of april 
because of a us federal aviation administration warning of a 
possible hijacking in europe 
when ibm decides there is something to be concerned about 
other companies will look at it very carefully as they should 
because ibm has an enviable management record said john banham 
director general of the confederation of british industry which 
represents 250000 businesses 
banham said companies that had a lot of employees traveling 
around the world would have to make their own decisions on whether 
to take similar action 
its worth remembering that ibm must have more people in the 
air at any one time than almost any other company so they have a 
particularly acute problem he said 
ibm based in armonk ny employs nearly 164000 people 
outside the united states 
michael mates chairman of the house of commons select committee 
on defense and a member of prime minister margaret thatchers 
governing conservative party said the ibm decision could have a 
worldwide snowball effect 
mates said he could not blame ibm management because the warning 
had been made public and the company might have been open to legal 
action in the united states if it had not taken precautions to 
protect its staff 
but of course the consequences of a firm of this size taking 
action like this could have a snowball effect all around the 
world he said in a british broadcasting corp radio interview 
news of the hijack warning was first reported in britains daily 
express newspaper the faa then confirmed thursday it had issued a 
security bulletin to airports and carriers on march 16 about the 
possibility of a hijacking of a us airliner in western europe 
mates said publicizing warnings to airlines opened the door to 
every nutcase in the world to telephone an airline with a 
threat 
at britains airports travelers faced delays of up to four 
hours because of stringent security checks and air traffic 
restrictions but many flights were taking off less than an hour 
behind schedule 
people appear to be turning up an extra halfhour early and i 
cant see as many portable cassette recorders which should speed 
things up said gatwick airport duty manager john lyons 
investigators have said the bomb that blew up pan am flight 103 
over lockerbie scotland dec 21 was concealed in a radiocassette 
recorder all 259 people aboard the boeing 747 were killed along 
with 11 people on the ground

us and vietnamese technical experts 
have discussed plans for further joint investigations to account 
for americans listed as missing in action in the vietnam war the 
us team said saturday 
a statement from the team leader lt col joe harvey said the 
two sides held the regular talks in vietnams capital hanoi from 
tuesday to friday 
it said the talks were productive and concentrated on plans 
for moving forward with joint investigations of discrepancy cases 
these are cases on which the united states says vietnamese 
authorities should have information such as american pilots who 
were captured but failed to emerge from prisoner of war camps 
the statement said they also discussed reports in which 
americans were supposedly sighted in vietnam after the war and 
future excavations of warplane crash sites to search for human 
remains 
the us team gave the vietnamese additional information for 
their unilateral investigations the statement said 
harvey is commander of the us joint casualty resolution 
center the honolulubased military unit entrusted with resolving 
the fates of 2371 americans who never returned from the war in 
indochina which ended with communist victories in 1975 of those 
1737 are reported missing in vietnam 545 in laos 83 in cambodia 
and six in china 
in vietnam work on the issue has accelerated since an august 
1987 agreement between a us presidential envoy retired gen john 
w vessey and vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach 
the two sides since have conducted four joint investigations on 
some of the 70 discrepancy cases the united states considers top 
priority 
a us military team flew to southern laos on march 18 for a 
joint excavation of a crash site laos had delayed that project for 
two weeks in a show of displeasure over us state department 
charges it was not cooperating with us narcotics suppression 
efforts

while attention was focused on the release from 
prison of the thin blue line defendant randall dale adams 
family and friends grieved for the police officer whose murder was 
the center of the case 
i noticed that adams has got a lot of publicity said randy 
spiller robert woods best friend as the two were growing up in 
dodd city a small town northeast of dallas theres not been 
much written about robert 
wood 27 was killed in november 1976 when he and his partner 
stopped a car whose headlights were off the motorist responded 
with gunfire shooting wood five times with a 22caliber pistol 
then fleeing 
at his 1977 trial adams was sentenced to death for the 
shooting a sentence that was later commuted to life in prison 
his case received wide attention when the acclaimed 1988 
documentary movie the thin blue line questioned evidence and 
testimony used in the trial and the prosecutors key witness 
death row inmate david harris recanted his testimony 
the texas court of criminal appeals earlier this month ordered a 
new trial and he was freed on bail tuesday on thursday officials 
announced that he would not be retried and filed a motion to 
dismiss the charge against him 
woods family has had little to say about adams release one 
sister said through police that the decision not to retry adams 
shows the state no longer cares about woods death but woods 
mother linzey said its not going to do much good its not 
going to bring him back 
john vance the dallas district attorney said thursday that it 
would be difficult to retry a case that was 13 years old because of 
problems in finding credible witnesses 
wood was born in oklahoma one of six children to a choctaw 
indian couple spiller said the family moved to dodd city when 
wood was a boy and for a time wood dreamed of playing 
professional baseball 
after graduating from high school in 1969 wood served two tours 
in vietnam he then returned to texas and began working as a 
policeman in the veterans hospital in bonham just west of dodd 
city 
one of woods bosses at the hospital eldon frair called him 
a born policeman 
the rev lonnie murphy the baptist preacher who married and 
buried wood agreed everything he did was to qualify himself as 
a policeman he said he would in a smaller town have ended 
up being chief of police he had a personality you just couldnt 
help but like 
he joined the dallas police force in 1974 working night patrol 
in west dallas a dangerous shift in one of the toughest 
neighborhoods 
sgt jt carey who was woods last boss in dallas believes 
the job fit his personality 
he really thought the profession he had chosen would not only 
fulfill his ambitions but also would give him a chance to help 
people carey said

runcie and the pope have met four times in 1980 in 1982 and 
twice in 1986 it will be runcies first visit to rome as 
archbishop of canterbury 
the archbishop sees the visit as an opportunity to make a 
strong affirmation of the commitment of anglicans and roman 
catholics to unity whatever obstacles there are to be overcome 
mrs keatley said 
the anglican church was established during the reformation of 
the 16th century after englands king henry viii broke with the 
vatican when pope clement vii refused the king a divorce 
the two largest christian churches have made tentative efforts 
toward unity but many anglicans do not accept the concept of papal 
infallibility and the likely primacy of the pope in a unified 
church 
in the 700 millionmember roman catholic church a major 
stumbling block is the ordination of women which some branches of 
the anglican communion accept 
mrs keatley said the visit had been under consideration before 
the consecration of the first woman bishop in the anglican 
communion the rt rev barbara harris of the episcopal church of 
the united states 
the two church leaders will review the work of the 
anglicanroman catholic international commission 
john paul in an easter letter to the archbishop welcomed the 
visit as an occasion for responding anew to the will of christ 
for the unity of his followers mrs keatley said 
the previous two archbishops of canterbury arthur ramsey and 
frederick coggan both made official visits to rome

president najibs government said 
saturday its air force thwarted new offensives by afghan moslem 
guerrillas with bombing raids in the past 48 hours around eastern 
jalalabad province 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said 345 
insurgents and seven pakistani militiamen were killed in the air 
strikes in jalalabad and southern kandahar province 
amani said only 15 afghan troops were killed six civilians died 
when they were caught in a crossfire in the battle for 
governmentheld city of jalalabad he said 
according to amani 173 guerrillas died in bombing raids east 
and south of jalalabad between sundown thursday and late saturday 
afternoon 
his figures could not immediately be verified the 
pakistanibased guerrillas usually report far lower death tolls 
fighting was continuing near jalalabad he said but it was 
100 percent certain the usbacked guerrillas were losing 
in another air strike south of kandahar 172 guerrillas and 
seven pakistani militiamen were killed friday he said the city 
has been under guerrilla attack for more than a year 
also in kandahar amani said about 2500 guerrillas attacked a 
security post at takhta poll 25 miles south of the city he 
claimed combatants included 500 pakistani militiamen and 12 saudi 
arabian advisers 
they were forced to retreat and were not even able to carry 
away the dead bodies he said adding afghan troops recovered 95 
of 179 insurgents 
pakistan supports the guerrillas but denied that any nationals 
are fighting in afghanistan 
the anticommunist guerrillas launched their first major 
offensive on jalalabad on march 6 less than three weeks after the 
soviet union withdrew the last red army troops who had been helping 
najibs forces in the decadeold civil war 
the government claims more than 2100 people mostly guerrillas 
have died since then in the battle for jalalabad 75 miles east of 
kabul 
amani said the guerrillas were shelling the city and surrounding 
security outposts with artillery and mortars but he said the 
insurgents were 15 to 18 miles from the city 
since thursday night he said guerrillas fired 1200 shells and 
artillery rounds on jalalabad airport and military posts from the 
ghaziabad area south of the city in the same period they fired 
4500 rounds from shewa a town east of jalalabad he said 
ghaziabad and shewa are within 25 miles of the pakistani border 
our air forces attack impeded their attack and in some areas 
they were fully forced to retreat said amani 
he said three afghan military supply convoys have reached 
jalalabad since thursday with the last arriving saturday afternoon 
the breakthrough signals a setback for rebels who have besieged the 
city since march 6 
if jalalabad falls it would give the guerrillas their first 
major city and provide internal headquarters for a 
governmentinexile elected in pakistan a month ago 
jalalabad had a prewar population of 200000 but fewer than 
half that number are thought to remain after a decade of war that 
sent 5 million afghanis fleeing to pakistan and iran 
amani also charged pakistani border police opened fire and 
killed 18 refugee women who tried to return to afghanistan at 
torkham to ascertain whether their relatives were among dead 
guerrilla fighters no immediate comment was available from the 
pakistani government

the customs service has been ordered to stop 
previously approved shipments of thousands of militarystyle 
assault rifles at us borders a government spokesman said 
saturday 
gerard rudden a spokesman with the treasury departments bureau 
of alcohol tobacco and firearms said the agency is requesting 
enforcement by customs of the temporary import ban on five types of 
semiautomatic weapons announced by the bush administration earlier 
this month 
when the ban was imposed it included the further importation 
of any of these types of firearms if they had not physically 
cleared customs he said 
rudden said atf has gone back to individuals who had 
importation requests previously approved and told them that any of 
these types of firearms would not be permitted into the country 
they were told that the importation privilege was suspended 
the los angeles times quoted an unidentified customs source as 
saying that the number of weapons previously approved for import 
totaled about 420000 
rudden said he was unable to confirm or deny that figure but he 
added that the numbers specified several months ahead in import 
permit applications are frequently much higher than the weapons 
actually shipped into this country 
its not unheard of for someone to ask to bring in 50000 
firearms and actually bring in only 100 firearms he said 
president bush will call a highlevel meeting early this week to 
discuss the status of administration efforts to deal with concerns 
about firearms in drugrelated violence and to talk about what 
further actions may be taken a white house official said saturday 
the white house meeting is slated to involve bush along with 
attorney general dick thornburgh national drug policy director 
william j bennett and treasury secretary nicholas f brady the 
meeting had been set for friday but brady could not make it that 
day said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush said in an interview with the washington times that he has 
been prompted to think anew on the issue in the wake of appeals 
from law enforcement groups 
i think the whole american people have changed he said 
when they see kids getting killed in a schoolyard and im a 
strong sportsman a hunter have been all my life and ive 
resisted the outrageous claims of some that would strip away 
legitimate weapons from legitimate sportsmen 
but here weve got a major new problem new in its intensity 
facing this country bush said

colossus reputed to be the largest 
gorilla in captivity apparently isnt considered much of a simian 
hunk by his wouldbe mate muke 
the female was brought to the zoo near this pensacola suburb 
here on breeding loan from the st louis zoo but the couple hasnt 
quite clicked said pat quinn director of the zoo 
they have shown no signs of mating quinn said recently 
she has shown no sign of presenting herself and im not sure yet 
he knows what to do 
muke pronounced mookey is the only other gorilla that 
colossus has seen since he was an infant 20 years earlier 
otherwise the socialization of colossus who had lived in 
solitude at a zoo in new hampshire for most of his life has gone 
well quinn said he is no longer abusive to muke although he does 
exert his dominance and herd her around which quinn said is normal 
for a gorilla 
but there has been no courting in the courtyard 
gorillas have to like each other to breed quinn said 
maybe he doesnt think shes pretty although i think she is 
beautiful and maybe she doesnt care for him too much 
colossus believed to be the biggest gorilla in captivity at 
more than 550 pounds is considered a good breeding candidate 
because he was captured in the wild as a baby and would bring some 
new genes into the worlds captive gorilla population quinn said 
he may seek other mates for the animal

fallout over the house speaker jim wrights 
ethics woes the savings and loan industry bailout and sen phil 
gramms budgetary crusades all pose a potential threat to the 46 
billion superconducting super collider a texas congressman says 
to the extent wright is weakened by any events related to this 
ethics committee thing it will also weaken our ability to get the 
super collider rep john bryant dtexas said 
bryant expressed doubt that a coming report from the house 
ethics committee concerning his finances would wound the speaker 
but he said unfavorable findings from the panel could be 
devastating to the future of the super collider a massive 
particle accelerator the energy department is planning to construct 
at a texas site 
bryant said he detects an antitexas undercurrent in congress 
the kind of budgetary pressure were experiencing is 
unprecedented and there is not a lot of good will right now toward 
our state he said 
bryant said texas is being blamed for the planned bailout of the 
troubled savings and loan industry at an estimated cost of more 
than 100 billion 
grumbling is also heard over an austerity plan to close military 
bases across the country but which leaves all texas installations 
intact except the navys homeport at galveston which is under 
construction 
texas also would gain from the possible construction of a space 
station and members of its congressional delegation are 
traditionally at the front of efforts to fund the space budget 
bryant said 
there is a general perception with a president speaker and 
all of these cabinet members from texas and all of our 
congressional chairmen that we have too many things going our 
way bryant said and we have to overcome that perception 
bryant said gramms opposition to homestate projects of other 
lawmakers has caused a measure of consternation in the senate 
gramm attacks every proposal here regarding spending even 
those that were worthy proposals and hes not receiving a very 
favorable reception from other senators when he goes and asks for 
his project bryant said 
gramm recently told the senate a coal purchase proposed by sen 
john heinz rpa was felony theft of the taxpayers money 
perpetrated by special interest groups who have spokesmen right 
here on this floor he called the weed science and technology 
center at north dakota state university a pork barrel project that 
could bust the budget 
not surprisingly sen kent conrad dnd replied by telling a 
recent hearing that the super collider was not high on his list of 
priorities 
here you are conrad told gramm one of the foremost 
advocates of being tough on spending in here advocating a spending 
project that would benefit your constituents 
he gramm was against north dakota getting a thing and now 
hes in here wanting it all for texas said sen wendell ford 
dky 
gramm spokesman larry neal said gramm stands by his criticism of 
heinz and the north dakota weed project 
the weed research institute was a budget buster neal said

jordans king hussein said on saturday 
that his country iraq and north yemen will boycott future arab 
summits unless egypt regains its arab league seat 
hussein linked his surprise disclosure of a boycott threat to 
calls for an extraordinary league summit to forge unified arab 
strategy for peace negotiations with israel 
hussein spoke to reporters at a briefing with president hosni 
mubarak and plo chief yasser arafat after they talked nearly five 
hours about coordinating a middle east peace strategy 
the meeting was in preparation for mubaraks talks in april and 
husseins in may with president bush in washington 
mubarak said a major aim of his washington talks is to seek 
agreement on an international middle east peace conference

threat recently when they formed a common market called the arab 
cooperation council 
there have been calls for an ordinary or extraordinary arab 
summit hussein said we are always for a summit and the 
members of the arab cooperation council will attend any summit 
together this is a decision we have taken to attend together 
asked if the opposite was true hussein nodded and said yes 
the arab league froze egypts membership in 1979 after it signed 
a peace treaty with israel of its 21 member states only syria and 
libya oppose egypts readmission 
the ismailiya summit was held on the eve of the 10th anniversary 
of the camp david treaty the first and only one between an arab 
country and the jewish state which is opposed to an international 
conference 
egyptian officials said the threeway summit came amid 
encouraging developments including wednesdays meeting in 
tunisia between us and palestine liberation organization 
representatives which got down to substantive issues for the first 
time since the dialogue began last december 
the officials who demanded anonymity also cited bushs praise 
of the dialogue in a newspaper interview in which he said he would 
try to convince israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir that 
something good might come from this 
bush is to meet mubarak on april 3 shamir on april 6 and

premier turgut ozal struggled to improve 
the chances of the motherland party in sundays local elections as 
public opinion polls indicated it would draw only about 31 percent 
of the vote 
the centerright party attracted 36 percent in the last general 
elections in 1987 and 416 percent in local polls five years ago 
surveys also predict motherland will lose the races for mayor in 
ankara the capital and izmir the thirdlargest city mayor 
bedrettin dalan was expected to carry istanbul the cultural and 
financial center for the party 
the opposition has been portraying the elections as an 
indication of national mood 
seven parties are competing to elect thousands of mayors city 
council members provincial assembly members village leaders and 
neighborhood representatives 
motherlands major rival is the social democrat populist party 
led by erdal inonu and made up of many politicians who served in 
the governments of former premier bulent ecevit in 1970s 
surveys predicted that the true path party headed by former 
premier suleyman demirel would come in third 
the 61yearold ozal has combined promises of expanded democracy 
with threats to resign in his efforts to improve motherland partys 
chances 
the prime minister who has been accused of nepotism by the 
opposition pledged to reshape his cabinet the day after elections 
party sources say ozals brother yusuf and his cousin husnu dogan 
may be left out of the cabinet 
ozal once lauded at home and abroad as turkeys economic 
miraclemaker proposed working with the opposition to fashion a 
new constitution for turkey that would bolster democratic freedoms 
and lift the ban on communist and religious parties 
the constitution was enacted in 1982 by the thenruling 
military it has come under fire as having too many restrictions on 
freedom of expression labor rights and academic autonomy 
the motherland party also has promised voters to reduce income 
tax withholding and to grant housing credits that were halted as a 
measure against inflation which hit 75 percent last year 
then on friday ozal told a news conference he would quit if 
major opposition gains in the polls made it difficult for him to 
govern on friday evening in a tv campaign appearance he asked 
turks to remember the turbulent 1970s when terrorism and an 
economic crisis paved the way for the 1980 military takeover 
anrchy will come back to haunt the country the shortages and 
lines for necessities will return if the opposition gains ozal 
said 
motherland party mayors have completed huge water and sewage 
projects and started lowcost housing projects to replace slums 
surrounding their cities 
but it is ozals overall record that has been the main campaign

members of the opposite sex burn lobsterpink in the bright 
sunshine 
this is the largest crowd to ever hit daytona beach traffic 
is snarled every parking space on the beach is taken plus all the 
private and public parking near the beach said beach department 
chief john kirvin at times you cant even find any sand 
sightseeing is one of the most popular activities 
i came here to look at the boys i mean men to look at 
tan chests said michelle abbott a junior at the university of

more after that said larry turner a botany student at southern 
illinois as he focused on a young woman strolling down the sand 
some men carried signs urging young women to take off their 
bikini tops one group of women carried a sign urging men to drop 
their trunks 
if their parents only knew what their daughters were doing 
said a beach police officer who asked not to be identified 
the party till you drop action moves from hotel pool decks 
onto the beach in early afternoon kirvin said 
he estimated that some 200 people have been arrested on the 
beach most for disorderly conduct and alcoholrelated offenses 
alcohol is not allowed on the beach but if students follow an 
officers warning to get rid of it they are not charged 
there is no way he said that his 36 fulltime officers and 15 
parttimers can stop everyone drinking on 40 miles of beach

the bishop of durham a familiar voice of 
controversy in the church of england has reiterated his belief 
that the resurrection of jesus christ was spiritual rather than 
physical 
the remarks of the rt rev david jenkins recorded for 
broadcast sunday by tyne tees television immediately drew 
suggestions he be replaced 
jenkins has frequently fueled controversy in the state church by 
publicly questioning the literal truth of several basic christian 
beliefs including the virgin birth and jesus rising from the dead 
some church members said it was an act of god when the great 
york minster cathedral was struck by lightning and badly burned 
three days after jenkins consecration there as bishop in 1984 
in remarks for broadcast easter sunday jenkins said knowing 
christ was alive was an inner feeling that did not need the 
physical proof of a corpse returning to life 
i dont think it means a physical resurrection it means a 
spiritual resurrection a transforming resurrection a real 
resurrection 
because the experiencing which enabled people to know that 
jesus was alive beyond death must be more than the revival of a 
corpse jenkins said 
geoffrey dickens a conservative member of parliament accused 
jenkins of seeking to undermine the whole doctrine of the 
church 
it would certainly be beneficial if ways could be found to 
remove him from office he said 
neil hamilton another tory legislator added when will the 
archbishop of canterbury give a lead and speak out against this 
man 
jenkins said he was sure the disciples did not think of the 
resurrection as a physical phenomenon 
if you read the echoes of the narratives let alone what st 
paul says i dont think it means a physical resurrection at all 
its a real presence a real renewal of personality which is now 
transformed to be alive forever he said 
sir nicholas fairbairn also a conservative legislator said of 
the bishop does he not know that christ appeared before his 
disciples and when they doubted he actually showed them the wounds 
of the nails on the cross 
another tory irvine patnick commented i am sure 
christianity which has been going on for 1989 years will 
continue despite his sudden statement which demolishes the church 
and its teaching 
controversy over jenkins beliefs prompted a church doctrine 
study in 1987 a commission of 14 theologians decided such 
controversies are a sign of vitality in the church

sen phil gramm rtexas announced saturday 
his 1984 campaign committee has agreed to pay a 30000 penalty to 
settle a 5year dispute with the federal election commission 
although errors made by his first senate campaign committee were 
unintended and in no way benefitted the campaign they were 
errors gramm said 
the fec does not contend that anyone in the campaign committee 
consciously sought to violate any fec reporting requirement and the 
committee is now in total compliance they were technical reporting 
errors and they in no way benefitted my campaign said gramm who 
intends to seek reelection in 1990 
in a statement gramm said he rejected suggestions that he take 
the fec to court to fight the penalty as unfair and unjustified 
because a lawsuit would cost many times the 30000 penalty 
donald r white treasurer of the friends of phil gramm 1984 
senate campaign committee said the fec accused the group of 
failure to make timely reports and failure to supply adequate 
documentation of campaign contributions 
according to white the fec questioned the campaigns handling 
of contributions from husbands and wives on joint checking 
accounts the fec has found that 15000 of 690000 in potentially 
excess contributions was outside the limit of 1000 per person 
per election 
after the committee provided documentation on the questionable 
contributions the fec decided 675000 was within the limits the 
remaining 15000 will be donated to charity white said 
also the fec questioned whether the campaign fully reported 
primary debts which white said were accurate although most of the 
debt had not been billed to the campaign by the time original 
reports were to have been filed the fec also determined that 
9708 in corporate funds were erroneously accepted the money has 
been refunded white said 
the fec complained that contributor identification data such as 
addresses and job title were not always available in a timely 
manner and not all funds were deposited within 10 days of receipt 
white said both assertions were correct in scattered instances 
and that complete information on each contributor was provided to 
the fec 
finally the fec complained that the campaign overpaid its share 
of a joint fundraiser at the 1984 republican national convention 
in dallas white said a campaign audit found the complaint to be 
accurate and has agreed to seek a 506 reimbursement from the only 
remaining cohost the national republican senatorial committee 
two other cohosts the texas victory 84 fund and the 
republican host committee have been disbanded 
in no way did the failure to obtain written allocation of 
funds on joint checking accounts the failure to report debt in the 
primary the overpayment of the committees share of fundraising 
costs or any other reporting error in any way benefit the gramm

almufti a former jordanian prime minister 
who helped lead his country to become an independent kingdom died 
on saturday staterun jordan television reported 
the report gave no details including where mufti died the 
cause of death or his age 
mufti was one of jordans most prominent citizens throughout the 
countrys 68year history as an emirate under british protection 
and later as an independent monarchy 
a strong nationalist he balked at the 1928 constitutional 
agreement with britain claiming it gave britain too much say in 
jordans affairs britain was responsible for jordan under a league 
of nations mandate jordan became an independent monarchy in 1946 
as prime minister from april to december 1950 mufti opposed 
king abdullahs negotiations with israel 
during his second term as prime minister in 1956 mufti 
expressed reservations about the baghdad pact a usbacked plan 
to create a belt of anticommunist nations from turkey to iran 
he was a major figure in the regency council that governed 
jordan between the abdication of king talal in 1952 and the 1953 
accession of king hussein then a teenager 
mufti was leader of jordans small community of circassians who 
had emigrated to jordan from the russian empire in the 19th century 
and who became a bedrock of support for the current hashemite 
monarchy 
he served repeatedly in jordanian cabinets from 1929 until the 
early 1960s often as deputy prime minister and as interior 
minister 
one of muftis sons azmi almufti was assassinated in 1985 
while serving as ambassador to greece jordanian diplomats at the 
time were targets of a wave of terrorist attacks by syrianbacked 
palestinian factions opposed to husseins efforts to reach peace 
with israel

the middle east landscape is vastly and 
dramatically changed since israel and egypt signed their historic 
peace treaty a decade ago palestinian arabs are in revolt and 
their cause is being promoted with the bush administration by 
nations around the world 
four key american players at the time and a former special us 
mediator all agree that the treaty has served the cause of peace in 
the troubled middle east 
it changed the map of the middle east and to a degree its 
political climate says cyrus r vance who was secretary of 
state when egypt and israel decided to turn from war to peace 
it established a precedent and provided a foundation on which 
one can still build says zbigniew brzezinski who was former 
president jimmy carters national security adviser in those parlous 
days 
the good news is the treaty has lasted says william quandt 
who was the national security councils mideast specialist 
its a framework that has really held up says harold 
saunders who headed the near east bureau at the state department 
the dramatic fact is not a single israeli or egyptian soldier 
has been killed on that border since the treaty went into effect 
says sol linowitz who subsequently served as carters special 
emissary to the middle east 
but all five interviewed separately for the 10th anniversary of 
the treaty registered impatience and disappointment with what the 
consider to be a lack of accomplishment in the years since 
they hope president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii will recapture the spirit and drive of camp david and apply it 
to israel and the palestinian arabs thousands of whom are in 
rebellion on the west bank and in gaza 
for 11 exhausting days to september 17 1978 carter shuttled 
between the cabins of the late egyptian president anwar sadat and 
thenisraeli prime minister menachem begin in the presidential 
retreat in marylands catoctin mountains and cajoled them into a 
peace accord that took the largest and most powerful arab country 
out of the conflict with israel 
the treaty which also required israel the victor in the 1967 
sixday war to return all captured territory to egypt the 
vanquished needed more than carters heavy lifting at camp david 
to be nailed down he had to go to the middle east and keep sadat 
and begin from flying apart again 
it was a highwire act but it worked 
israel would like a warmer relationship from egypt more trade 
tourism and the other trappings of friendship egypt would like 
israel to give up the rest of the land the arabs lost in 1967 but 
they are at peace 
vance who negotiated several of the key provisions of the 
treaty with the late israeli foreign minister moshe dayan said 
from his new york law office it has prevented another war 
between israel and its neighbors and it has laid the first stones 
for a just and enduring peace 
but vance quickly added i think the question we have to ask 
ourselves now is how can we breath new life into the peace 
process 
he suggested three ways 
by demonstrating a willingness to try again starting with 
confidencebuilding measures 
by being willing to engage in creative fresh thinking 
and a willingness to think the unthinkable 
by the parties to the arabisraeli conflict putting 
themselves in the shoes of the person across the table 
specifically vance said the time has come for direct talks 
between israel and the palestinians including the palestine 
liberation organization 
i still believe peace is possible he said but its going 
to take courage and great political will on the part of all 
involved 
vance doesnt mean only arabs and israelis he also means the 
united states 
i think the united states has a clear and important role to 
play and i hope that the united states will put the middle east 
question on its agenda he said i have seen some recent signs 
of this 
brzezinski who sometimes disagreed with vance on other policy 
issues when they served under carter voiced similar views in in a 
separate interview from his washington office 
he called the treaty a partial success but also a partial 
failure and said the failure is obviously the absence of 
progress on the west bank issue 
the camp david agreement which established the outline for the 
peace treaty called for five years of autonomy for the 
palestinians on the israeliheld west bank and in gaza afterward 
all options including statehood were to be open for negotiations 
brzezinski said the palestinians have grown stronger since 1979 
he said the transitional period should be shortened and it should 
lead to some form of statehood 
and that he said means israel negotiating directly with the 
plo 
baker seems to be taking the first few steps in that direction 
he has not broken off us talks with the plo despite several 
guerrilla attempts at infiltrating israel he has stressed his aim 
is to bring israelis and palestinians together and he has said 
that might require israel talking to the plo 
quandt a scholar who met recently with chairman yasser arafat 
and other plo officials said he had nothing against the notion 
that incremental steps are valuable 
but he said events in the middle east are accelerating 
israelis understand they are going to have to make a deal with 
the palestinians quandt said and i think the palestinians are 
willing to talk to israel as it is 
quandt summed up i think we are in sight of israeliplo 
negotiations 
saunders like quandt a mideast scholar at the brookings 
institution offered this curbstone advice a strong involvement 
by the president and secretary of state is going to be necessary 
its taken a lot of time for egyptians and israelis to learn to 
talk to each other 
the israelipalestinian relationship today is a lot more fully 
developed once they get together they are going to be able to do 
more on their own than was in the case of egypt and israel 
linowitz who tried to build on the peace treaty as carters 
mideast envoy from late 1979 until the onset of the reagan 
administration in 1981 puts a lot of the blame for a lack of 
progress on the west bank and gaza since the treaty on the 
unwillingness of the united states to take real leadership 
he said he had urged alexander m haig jr who had taken over 
as secretary of state to appoint a special emissary to pick up 
the negotiations where they then were on the palestinian issue 
linowitz said he thought at the time if that were done it 
would be possible to have a treaty by may of 1981 
but he said the administration wanted to take its time and 
valuable time was lost

randall dale adams has little chance of getting 
compensated for his 12year imprisonment and nearexecution for a 
police murder he didnt commit because texas law protects his 
prosecutors experts say 
even if theres out and out misconduct even if he the 
prosecutor lied you cant sue the prosecutor dallas civil 
rights attorney doug larson said 
adams was freed last week after his conviction was overturned 
new evidence brought out in the film the thin blue line had 
strongly suggested that another man committed the killing 
adams attorney randy schaffer said he hasnt discussed the 
possibility of a lawsuit with his client who has returned home to 
columbus ohio but if adams agrees schaffer said he has some 
ideas 
what i might do is sue former assistant district attorney 
doug mulder and challenge him to waive any claim of prosecutorial 
immunity schaffer said if doug mulder feels that his conduct 
was defensible i challenge him to waive immunity and try this 
matter on the merits 
on the other hand if he concedes his conduct was illegal 
unethical and dishonest then i invite him to invoke prosecutorial 
immunity as a defense 
schaffer said he also intends to ask the texas legislature to 
authorize goodwill compensation for adams who spent 12 years in 
prison and at one point was only three days away from being 
executed for the slaying his sentence was later commuted to life 
imprisonment 
adams would not be the only texas victim of wrongful conviction 
unable to receive redress 
lenell geter who served 16 months of a life sentence after he 
was wrongfully convicted of a 1982 robbery saw his 82 million 
federal lawsuit claiming civil rights violations dismantled last 
year marvin maurice wells whose 1986 capital murder trial was

didnt even try to win compensation his attorney roger joyner 
told him texas law made no provision for it 
in fact joyner suggested that senegars case would be ruled

the federal trade commission is pushing for 
the forfeiture of an estimated 75 million in profits made by 
brothers steven and mitchell rales in their unsuccessful drive to 
acquire interco inc last year according to published reports 
accounts in the washington post and ftc watch a private 
newsletter said three of the commissions five members have asked 
the justice department to take the two washington entrepreneurs to 
court over their alleged failure to comply with merger notification 
requirements 
the post said the three commissioners hope to make an example of 
the raleses in a bid to keep secret takeover artists frmom thumbing 
their noses at the comparatively paltry civil fines which the ftc 
is empowered to level by itself 
ftc and justice department officials declined to discuss the 
case saturday i can neither confirm nor deny that such a 
petition has been sent to the department said ftc spokeswoman 
susan ticknor 
at issue is whether the rales brothers should have informed the 
ftc sooner last year that they had acquired more than 15 million 
worth of stock in interco a st louis consumer goods conglomerate 
the post said the comissioners charged that the rales eclipsed the 
trigger holdings last may but didnt serve notice until nov 10 
the post said that when the rales brothers who control more 
that 20 companies retreated from the interco bid they sold their 
stock at an estimated 75 million profit if the ftc leveled its 
maximum fine of 10000 per day they would pay an estimated 38 
million still leaving them more than 70 million ahead the 
newspaper said 
ftc commissioner terry calvani while declining to discuss the 
rales case said the civil fine is totally inadequate to deter 
acquisitive corporations and individuals from engineering their 
takeover gambits in the dark if a company can save or make 30 
million by paying a 300000 fine he said its going to cut 
that penalty check quickly 
the brothers and their attorneys declined to discuss ftcs 
reported request that the justice department sue for the 
disgorgement of all their profits from the sales of interco 
stock but the post said they had taken the position that the 
notification delay was perfectly legal and moreover were 
protected by a provision in the law that exempts partnerships from 
the reporting requirement if no investor controls more than 50 
percent of the partnership each of the rales owned 49 percent of 
the group which bid for interco 
with virtually no precedent for such a disgorgement case it was 
unclear who might get the money even if the justice department and 
the courts side with the ftc ms ticknor said returning the 
profits to interco shareholders was one possibility or it might 
just go to the us treasury

the spokesman for deposed philippine president 
ferdinand marcos and 14 other marcos supporters face possible 
deportation by the us government with a preliminary hearing on 
the first four cases scheduled for monday officials said 
ronald oldenburg the attorney for marcos spokesman gemmo 
trinidad claimed friday the hearings were an attempt to isolate 
and to some extent harass the marcos group and intimidate them into 
incriminating mr marcos 
but william craig hawaii district director for the immigration 
and naturalization service said the government routinely reviews 
the status of aliens to determine whether they are maintaining the 
status by which they entered the united states 
if there is no reason to be here any longer we can request 
that they depart thats all there is to it craig said 
marcos and his wife imelda are under us indictment for 
allegedly plundering their homeland of more than 100 million and 
stashing much of the money in the united states 
mondays preliminary hearing was scheduled via telephone with a 
federal immigration judge in san diego 
oldenburg said the supporters involved were not part of the 
initial group that accompanied marcos from the philippines to 
hawaii in february 1986 those people were granted parole status by 
the reagan administration 
trinidad for example entered the united states a few months 
later with a sixmonth tourist visa and was allowed to stay after 
it expired oldenburg said 
if this is not an effort to in some way isolate the marcoses 
why was he trinidad allowed to remain almost three years and 
suddenly now they issue a deportation action oldenburg asked 
trinidads phone was disconnected and the associated press was 
unable to contact him through marcos residence saturday 
marcos has been in st francis medical center since jan 15 for 
treatment of heart and lung ailments he was listed in guarded 
condition saturday

passenger loads on strikebound eastern airlines 
northeast shuttle were extremely light entering the busy easter 
weekend travel period as the carrier ended a cutrate ticket 
promotion the pilots union said saturday 
the average number of passengers carried friday on the shuttle 
linking boston new york and washington was between 25 and 35 
according to an air line pilots association news release on 
thursday eastern flew 60 shuttle flights with some carrying as 
few as three or four passengers the release said 
most of easterns 3600 pilots along with flight attendants 
have refused to cross picket lines as the machinists strike against 
the airline entered its fourth week saturday 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the airline does not 
release passengerload figures specifically for the shuttle 
although it had a monthly traffic report for all its flights 
but she said the holiday weekend was not a peak time for the 
shuttle which caters to business travelers and loads had been 
light ever since the strike started march 4 
were running a good reliable product in the shuttle ms 
ceremsak said its a shame that an organization that claims to 
be professional like alpa is busy trying to drive a stake through 
the heart of a great airline 
the miamibased carrier on friday raised ticket prices to their 
original 99 daily and 69 weekend oneway fares after cutting 
fares to as low as 12 
meanwhile a miami judge scheduled a hearing monday on easterns 
request to order the pilots back to work 
on friday a threejudge appeals panel ordered us district 
judge edward davis in miami to determine if the walkout by pilots 
is a sympathy strike or a de facto strike to press their own 
contract demands davis earlier had refused to issue a ruling 
saying he lacked authority 
the claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used a a pretext to 
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the 
railway labor act the appeals court said 
davis could order the pilots back to work if he finds they 
called a strike over their own contract demands without having 
exhausted all collective bargaining options required under the 
railway labor act 
three weeks after easterns 8500member machinists union 
struck the airline continues operating just a small fraction of 
its prestrike schedule of 1040 flights the carrier is presently 
operating only its northeast shuttle and latin american routes 
while it attempts to rebuild under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the trustee of the new york bankruptcy court that is hearing the 
eastern case next week will appoint an examiner who will have the 
dual role of investigator and mediator 
i think this is an examiner who has all the authority except 
for operating the business said harry jones the court trustee 
in new york 
the examiner will among other things probe union allegations 
that texas air corp easterns parent damaged the carrier by 
stripping it of assets such as its reservations systems planes and 
various routes and airport facilities 
the examiner also could become involved with easterns union 
contracts in an attempt to remove obstacles to the carriers 
rebuilding plans 
its conceivable he could come back and say the parties are at 
an impasse said harvey miller easterns bankruptcy lawyer he 
could come back and say texas air is irresponsible or the unions 
are irresponsible 
meanwhile disappointed band members at two cincinnati high 
schools hoped to recover 30900 they deposited with a miami travel 
agency that canceled their trip to mexico because of the strike 
sixtyeight students from the suburban greenhills and forest 
park high schools along with 17 parents and teachers staged 
fundraisers for the concert trip to merida mexico during the 
spring school break 
the owner of the travel firm has apparently agreed to return the 
money

thousands of people venting their anger over 
privileges of the communist party elite rallied saturday to 
support maverick candidate boris n yeltsin on the eve of national 
parliamentary elections 
for shame for shame more than 10000 people roared when 
speakers listed newspapers and politicians who have attacked 
yeltsin for his unorthodox campaign in the soviet unions first 
contested election in more than 70 years 
hundreds of police stood guard nearby 
yeltsin is one of thousands of soviets campaigning nationwide to 
win a seat sunday in the new 2250seat congress of peoples 
deputies the new chamber was created last year in broad electoral 
reforms championed by president mikhail gorbachev 
since his ouster as moscows communist party boss in 1987 
yeltsin has emerged as an antiestablishment crusader against 
privileges for the powerful including access to special stores 
better food and chauffeured luxury cars 
critics in the partys central committee accuse him of accepting 
the same privileges 
thousands chanted yeltsins name at the peaceful rally in a vast 
parking lot next to lenin stadium supporting his campaign promise 
to work to reduce the privileges if voters elect him 
do away with special privileges for politicians and 
bureaucrats said a placard one demonstrator held aloft on a ski 
pole servants of the people should have to stand in line said 
another banner 
hundreds of police lined the entrance to the parking lot scores 
of reinforcements waited in dozens of buses parked nearby around a 
bend in the road hidden by trees 50 military trucks packed with 
soldiers were parked rally organizers from three moscow 
political action groups had obtained permission for the threehour 
rally after convincing authorities it would be better than having 
an illegal demonstration such a march 19 rally in which thousands 
of yeltsin supporters marched through downtown moscow 
yeltsin 58 is running against 51yearold yevgeny brakov 
director of the zil auto factory for the right to represent all of 
moscow with its 65 million registered voters 
brakovs campaign has been focused on the issue of ending 
chronic soviet food shortages i am for a speedy decision on the 
food problem development of food and processing industries he 
said in an article written for the newspaper economic gazette 
speakers at the rally also praised the political reforms that 
have made sundays election possible 
this is the first time in 70 years we have had a real 
election speaker igor chubais told them 
he was followed by popular poet yevgeny yevtushenko who was 
loudly applauded after reading a short poem praising gorbachevs 
policy of glasnost or openness which allowed the rally to take 
place 
a british newspaper on sunday quoted yeltsin as saying in an 
interview that restructuring should have begun with problems 
which everyone would have understood including food 
distribution housing and living standards 
we have wasted 3 years the sunday telegraph quoted him as 
saying now the new direction is concentrating on exactly those 
three points we have admitted that we did not have an overall 
conception of perestroika restructuring 
yelstin said he and gorbachev have different ideas on how to 
push through perestroika but did not see himself as an 
alternative to mr gorbachev according to the newspaper 
yeltsin said the government needs to cut military spending and 
chop investment in industrial construction by about 40 percent 
he also inveighed against privileges for the elite how can 
one tolerate one man eating good quality sausage and another not 
perestroika should have started in the communist party he said 
voting takes place sunday at 180000 stations which will open 
from 7 am to 8 pm in the countrys 11 time zones 
first results are expected late sunday night but full results 
will not be known for about 10 days said the official soviet news 
agency tass election officials say than 190 million of the 280 
million soviets are eligible to vote 
on sunday 1500 seats are being contested and the other 750 
seats were filled by the communist party and other officially 
sanctioned groups about 80 percent of the candidates are party 
members

the worlds first space chick was 
joined by a brood of cousins saturday less than a week after their 
eggs concluded a fiveday flight aboard the space shuttle 
discovery officials said 
the first chick a 418gram male named kentucky emerged 
from its shell about 830 pm est friday at kentucky fried chicken 
headquarters the company said in a statement the fastfood 
restaurant chain sponsored the experiment 
fifteen more of the space eggs hatched saturday afternoon and 
16 earthbound eggs that were fertilized later are expected to hatch 
in the next few days 
the experiment conceived by purdue university senior john 
vellinger is designed to measure the effects of a weightless 
environment on embryo development 
the first chick looked normal but only time will tell how well 
it does said gregg reynolds a spokesman for kentucky fried 
chicken 
the only thing were sure about now is that its a boy he 
said 
vellinger 23 was as excited as an expectant father 
reynolds said 
it sends chills up my spine to realize ive done something no 
one has ever done before the young scientist said 
when discovery was launched on march 13 it carried an incubator 
designed by vellinger containing 32 chicken eggs a similar 
incubator with a control group of 32 eggs was kept on the ground 
during the mission 
the two groups of eggs and the chicks that emerge from those 
eggs will be studied at purdue by vellinger and a team of 
scientific advisers from four universities during the next year 
before a paper assessing the results of the experiment is prepared 
vellinger and his five scientific advisers opened the other half 
of the 32 discovery eggs and half from the control group left on 
earth after the shuttle landed to examine the embryos at that 
stage in their development 
the project may help solve some puzzling problems of space 
flight said ronald hullinger a professor of veterinary medicine 
at purdue and one of vellingers advisers 
information the scientists glean from differences in cartilage 
bone tissue and internal organs between the space chicks and their 
earthbound contemporaries may shed light on motion sickness in zero 
gravity and the puzzling loss of bone mass in astronauts it could 
also provide clues about humans reproducing during generationslong

city officials thought they would save 
13500 annually by pulling retired german shepherds out of the 
public trough but the action brought a snarling response from the 
dogs human supporters 
the trouble began when the police department decided to cut off 
retirement benefits for overthehill police dogs who had been 
receiving pensions of food biscuits and veterinary care 
first the fraternal order of police announced plans for a 
lawsuit then a group of activists gathered more than 1000 
signatures on petitions urging police commissioner willie l 
williams to reverse the decision 
the leader of the petition campaign randi l biba also wrote 
to various dog food manufacturers pleading for help 
finally alpo petfood inc based in allentown came through 
this week with an offer to provide free canned or dry food for the 
36 retirees until the issue is resolved alpo volunteered to give 
food to police for distribution

the deal

false aircraft images on radar screens 
startled air traffic controllers at an federal aviation 
administration center but one official said the problem may have 
been a computer that just went haywire 
controllers at the denver air route traffic control center at 
several sectors were astonished to see numerous ufos appearing on 
their radar displays kevin cain a center spokesman said of the 
incident on tuesday 
cain the centers national air traffic controllers association 
safety chairman released written comments on the incident friday 
faa officials would not comment directly on the incident 
these unidentified targets looked like actual aircraft with 
apparently normal speeds and altitudes cains statement said 
some controllers had a dozen or more of these targets merging 
with actual aircraft targets over a halfhour period 
mitch barker an faa spokesman at the regional office in 
seattle would not directly answer when questioned about the false 
targets 
cain said he believed the problem was caused by a relatively new 
computer system in operation at the center in september 1987 
the head of the safety committee for the controllers union 
believes that the new computer just went haywire for that period of 
time cain said we have not seen anything like this out there 
before 
barker said the problems were caused by the data feed from the 
grand junction radar site 
they were having a problem with the transponders which 
automatically send information from the aircraft to the center 
said barker the faa would only confirm that the controllers were 
not receiving correct data blocks of identifying information that 
appear on controller screens 
they had a day before a commercial power outage in grand 
junction this problem appeared after that outage barker said 
a relay had gone bad they believe that outage had something to 
do with it 
barker said the radar feed was only out for 51 minutes and 
adjoining radar sites were able to provide sufficient radar data to 
the sectors involved 
other controllers at the site said it is not unusual to get 
false targets on occasion but such a large number of false targets 
might be dangerous during busy traffic times one sector might 
have about 15 real targets on the screen although cain said the 
false targets appeared at a slow time of day 
the center controls aircraft between airports in about 35 
sectors an area including colorado and wyoming and parts of utah 
oklahoma kansas nebraska and south dakota 
cain said there have been a number of computer and radio 
problems at the center during the last year

a grisly find on a country golf course has 
police culling clues from around the nation but so far detectives 
are baffled about the identity of a woman whose head was discovered 
lying along a brook 
police say they may have to use the lastest technology of modern 
forensics to determine the victims identity 
we have nothing concrete said hopewell township police lt 
michael chipowski weve gotten dozens of calls about people who 
havent been seen for a while but they havent led anywhere 
chipowski said the case has recently drawn more than 200 leads 
and inquiries from across the nation 
probably nothing has stirred up such excitement here since the 
lindbergh case chipowski said referring to the trial of bruno 
hauptmann who was convicted in a nearby courthouse of murdering 
flying ace charles lindberghs baby son a half century ago 
this is certainly out of the ordinary its a real mystery 
he said 
the female human head was discovered march 5 by a golfer whose 
errant shot sent him searching for his ball along the bank of a 
brook at the hopewell valley golf club north of trenton chipowski 
said police believe the killing occurred just before the discovery 
because there was fresh makeup on the head and the features were 
in a good state 
we have about 30 leads yet to complete said chipowski 
well run down every one of them

the us customs service has deployed 
nationwide a special group of field associates to investigate 
drugrelated corruption and other internal problems an agency 
spokesman said saturday night 
the spokesman richard weart said these personnel had been 
specially selected to be alert for serious types of corruption 
they are assigned to a district office or regional office or 
to the office of enforcement but they are not directly assigned to 
internal affairs weart said 
he said they are not paid extra for their role in monitoring 
other employees 
but if the situation arises they will report to a local office 
of internal affairs on such matters weart said 
the washington post reported in sundays editions that assistant 
customs commissioner for internal affairs william f green had 
recruited about 40 agency employees as field associates assigned to 
key offices nationwide to keep their eyes and ears open for any 
wrongdoing among their colleagues 
the post said the group was selected from among recruits 
training at the federal law enforcement academy at glynco ga 
weart acknowledged that the group had received additional 
training for uncovering serious types of corruption such as theft 
of cash or other evidence seized by the service but he said they 
were certainly not trained as spies 
in our view for an agency that is on the front line of drug 
interdiction we intend to hold our employees to a higher 
standard he said 
weart said the approach of having employees act as informers 
against their coworkers was nothing new explaining that the 
code of conduct for federal employees required reporting wrongdoing 
by fellow workers 
he added that the program was modeled after a new york city 
police department internal investigation headed by exofficer frank 
serpico 
recently two customs inspectors were arrested in hidalgo texas 
on bribery charges and five agency workers were arrested in new 
york with airport and agriculture departmewnt workers on 
drugdealing charges

millions of gallons of crude oil that 
spilled when a tanker ran aground spread across a wildliferich 
stretch of ocean saturday and alaskas chief environmental officer 
criticized cleanup efforts as too slow 
the biggest oil spill in us history created a slick about 
seven miles long and seven miles wide in prince william sound the 
coast guard said only reef island and the western edge of bligh 
island had been touched by the slick 
this situation i think was everyones secret nightmare about 
what could happen with oil traffic in the sound said dennis 
kelso commissioner of the alaska department of environmental 
conservation 
some 240000 barrels about 10080000 gallons of crude oil 
from alaskas north slope spilled early friday when the 987foot 
tanker exxon valdez ran hard aground on bligh reef about 25 miles 
outside valdez where it had taken on a total cargo of 12 million 
barrels initial reports indicated 270000 barrels had spilled 
what we have here is a major environmental catastrophe said 
one oil spill expert richard golob of boston publisher of golob 
oil pollution bulletin 
golob said cleanup equipment at the site was grossly 
inadequate but added that even under ideal circumstances cleanup 
efforts would not have significantly reduced the spills impact 
it is an enclosed body of water he said the only way for 
this oil to ecape out to the sea is by traversing the entire length 
of prince william sound with all its islands fjords and bays and 
channels 
and during that transit undoubtedly a large stretch of 
shoreline will be contaminated he said 
divers saturday said they had found six to eight holes in the 
vessels hull large enough to swim through said frank iarossi 
president of exxon shipping co about 30 feet of the vessel is 
resting on a shelf on the reef 
efforts to begin pumping 200000 gallons of oil off the exxon 
valdez onto another tanker the exxon baton rouge were halted 
early saturday when authorities noticed that oil appeared to 
leaking as the pumping operation proceeded 
eleven of 17 tanks that lie forward of the ships masthead were 
ruptured in the accident causing concern over removal of the oil 
said coast guard lt ed wieliczkiewicz 
whenever you start removing oil from a vessel this size it has 
to be done in a controlled manner wieliczkiewicz said if its 
not you endanger the stability of the vessel 
wieliczkiewicz said a boom was placed around the exxon valdez 
and the exxon baton rouge to help contain oil around the vessels 
he also said four members of the coast guards pacific strike 
team from san francisco specially trained to deal with pollution 
and oil spills arrived saturday and were helping to rig pumps and 
assemble equipment needed to transfer oil to the baton rouge 
kelso was highly critical of what he said was a slow response to 
the spill 
the initial reponse was inadequate and unacceptable he said 
before a news conference saturday kelso said the efforts should 
have been under way in five hours but took much longer you miss 
the opportunity right at the beginning and youve missed our best 
opportunity to do something 
kelso said alaska has a plan for oil spills that calls for 
action within five hours of a spill it took several hours longer 
he said and only two of seven skimmers available to the alyeska 
pipeline service co were used at the outset 
alyeska spokesman chuck odonnel said he was satisfied with his 
companys actions i think our people did an excellent job he 
said 
the spills effect on wildlife had not yet been assessed but 
commercial fishermen who depend on the sound for a catch worth 
millions of dollars were outraged and said a key herring spawning 
area had been polluted 
the whole food chain could be affected by the spill said 
alan reichman ocean ecology coordinator for the environmental 
group greenpeace in seattle 
theres a high concentration of sea otter waterfowl sea 
birds and pink salmon in that area said steve goldstein a 
spokesman for the interior department in washington some birds 
have already died and we are doing our best to try to save the 
fish by containing the oil to the area where it presently is and by 
trying to skim it 
whales porpoises and seals are also common in prince william 
sound its kind of like sailing through a zoo said jim 
lethcoe who lives on a boat in the sound and operates a sailing 
business 
an animal cleanup station was set up in a building at the 
community college in valdez but volunteers there said they had no 
animals to work on by midafternoon 
the response to the spill also drew fire from the 12000member 
united fishermen of alaska 
we feel that this should have been the easiest oil spill in 
the world to clean up said riki ott chairman of the 
organizations habitat committee she noted that the spill had 
occurred in a protected area close to the valdez marine terminal 
and the water was calm 
ott said the spill had polluted prince william sounds primary 
herring spawning area fishermen also take salmon and shellfish 
from the sound last year they were paid about 85 million for 
their catches she said 
the port of valdez remained closed to tanker traffic north 
slope crude oil is shipped 800 miles through the transalaska oil 
pipeline from prudhoe bay south to valdez for shipment aboard 
tankers to refineries outside alaska 
the coast guard said the exxon valdez struck the reef when it 
maneuvered outside normal tanker traffic lanes to avoid icebergs 
the vessels captain joseph hazelwood has worked for exxon for 
20 years at least 10 as a ships master it was unclear if a pilot 
was aboard the exxon valdez when it grounded 
there was no decision saturday on whether to use chemicals to 
disperse the oil but a test of the dispersal method was being 
conducted saturday afternoon as was a test to determine whether at 
least some of the crude oil could be burned 
coast guard cmdr steven mccall said national transportation 
safety board investigators are expected to arrive sunday to take 
over the accident probe 
he said one or more bloodalcohol tests were administered after 
the grounding but he said he didnt know know how many people were 
tested or the results mccall said the tests routinely are 
administered in marine accidents involving federal jurisdiction 
the coast guard issued a statement late saturday that mccall has 
subpoenaed the ships master and two crew members 
the subpoenas require them to make themselves available to ntsb 
investigators arriving sunday the coast guard said the supoenas 
were routine 
previously the largest us tanker spill was the dec 15 1976 
grounding of the argo merchant tanker off the nantucket shoals off 
massachusetts in which 76 million gallons of oil spilled golob 
said 
up to 107 million gallons of oil was lost on nov 1 1979 when 
the tanker burmah agate collided with another ship in galveston 
bay texas however that oil burned as well as spilled 
the largest tanker spill in history resulted from the july 19 
1979 collision off tobago of the supertankers atlantic empress and 
aegean captain in which 300000 tons more than 80 million 
gallons of oil was lost
