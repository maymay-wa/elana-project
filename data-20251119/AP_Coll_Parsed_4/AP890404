soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said tuesday 
that the superpowers should renounce military intervention in latin 
america and the caribbean and make the region a zone of peace 
addressing the cuban national assembly he also emphasized that 
sovietstyle reforms are not a universal remedy for other communist 
countries including cuba 
we do not regard our approaches and solutions as some 
universal prescription for all he said in what appeared an 
attempt to minimize the difference between cubas orthodox 
communism and gorbachevs new pragmatism 
gorbachev said the soviet union opposes the export of 
revolution or counterrevolution referring to both cuban and us 
policy in latin america 
but he also reaffirmed that the soviet union will continue 
supplying weaponry to nicaraguas leftist government as long as the 
united states continues to arm other central american countries 
the issue remains a major sore point in relations between 
washington and moscow 
in washington president bush and secretary of state james a 
baker iii both said they had not had a chance to review gorbachevs 
speech but baker said his comment on nicaragua was the same old 
line theyve been pushing 
there had been speculation that gorbachev in a gesture of 
friendship toward cuba might announce forgiveness of part or all 
of cubas debt to the soviet union 
but he barely mentioned the subject merely restating his 
position that the industrialized nations of the world should try to 
help ease the burden of debtor nations in the developing world 
cuban president fidel castro in a 50minute introduction that 
was only three minutes shorter than his guests address lambasted 
the united states in a characteristic diatribe he blamed his 
longtime adversary for regional conflicts throughout the world and 
for pulling the third worlds leg by proposing unworkable 
solutions to the critical problem of third world debt 
waving his arms and jabbing his fingers the 62yearold castro 
rejected suggestions of friction in sovietcuban relations he said 
he was in full agreement with gorbachevs contention that each 
communist country must solve the problems of developing socialism 
in its own way 
gorbachev who had been expected to outline soviet policy toward 
latin america essentially reiterated his governments longstanding 
view that the united states holds the key to peace in central 
america and must halt its intervention in order to encourage 
settlement of regional strife 
we have a real possiblity of guaranteeing peace he said 
but all sides must halt military supplies to the region 
the soviet union does not seek for itself political strategic 
or military advantage in the western hemisphere gorbachev said 
we consider that this hemisphere and all others must not be an 
arena for eastwest confrontation 
in proposing establishment of a zone of peace the soviet 
president said his country does not have any intention of having 
in latin america naval air or missile bases or to place there 
nuclear or other weapons of mass extermination 
he called on the united states and other countries to adopt a 
similar approach to continue the transformation of latin america 
into a region of peace security and stability 
the soviet union and cuba are principal suppliers of the 
sandinista regime in nicaragua and leftist guerrillas in el 
salvador the united states provides nonmilitary aid to nicaraguas 
contra rebels and weaponry to the salvadoran government honduras 
and other nations 
soviet sources predicted before gorbachev left moscow that the 
soviet leader would try to persuade castro to extract cuba from 
involvement in leftist struggles around the world and concentrate 
on building the cuban economy which after three decades of 
socialism is still heavily reliant on soviet aid 
we are resolutely opposed to any theories and doctrines 
justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution all forms 
of foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign states 
gorbachev said in his speech 
he made similar statements after the speech at a news 
conference saying that power policies have totally discedited 
themselves 
earlier in an interview with the soviet news agency tass 
gorbachev suggested that he and castro are prepared to work for 
improved eastwest relations indicating some softening in the 
cuban leaders rigid antiamericanism 
gorbachev told tass a central topic of his talks with castro on 
monday was the new thinking in soviet foreign policy an 
approach that seeks to ease world tensions by reducing military 
commitments abroad and negotiating settlements of regional disputes 
that threaten to bring the superpowers into conflict 
it is a tenet of gorbachevs reform policies at home that the 
soviet union must demonstrate to the west it is eager to serve as a 
cooperative partner in world economic development and dispel the 
kremlins enemy image of the cold war era 
castro and gorbachev signed a 25year accord the cuban news 
agency prensa latina said dashes all speculation about a rift 
between havana and moscow and ratifies their traditional 
relations 
but despite a show of friendship between he two communist 
allies a series of arrests in havana on tuesday underscored the 
differences between the pragmatic liberalism espoused by gorbachev 
and the tight control still exercised by castro 30 years after he 
led a guerrilla army to victory over a rightwing dictatorship 
police rounded up seven dissidents who were planning a 
demonstration tuesday evening in support of gorbachevs reforms 
among those detained was samuel martinez lara leader of the 
prohuman rights party according to government and dissident 
spokesmen 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
condemned the arrests saying they underscore the need for 
ongoing monitoring of the human rights situation in cuba

twenty years after he performed the worlds first 
implant of an artificial heart into a human dr denton a cooley 
on tuesday said further medical advances have been hindered by 
ethical doubts and regulatory interference 
despite the difficulties cooley said on the anniversary of the 
operation that he expects still greater achievements over the next 
20 years 
the heart is truly a remarkable organ and developing a perfect 
substitute is going to be a challenge not only for this generation 
but for generations of researchers to come cooley said 
research institutions and investigators throughout the world 
are challenged by this project and i think that we will see an 
acceptable totally implantable permanent device within the next 15 
to 20 years 
it was april 4 1969 when cooley and his associates at the 
texas heart institute implanted a totally artificial heart into the 
chest of haskell karp a 47yearold printing estimator from 
skokie ill 
karp lived for three days on the device and then received a 
human heart transplant but died a day later when infection and 
tissue rejection set in 
cooley had first attempted a surgical repair of karps heart 
but the organ was too badly damaged and it was clear he would not 
survive the doctor said 
this was the first time that we decided we werent going to 
pull the plug but that we were going to give this man that remote 
chance of survival cooley said 
the first heart transplant had been performed less than two 
years before the proven human use of an artificial heart which 
earlier had shown promise in research animals elated the surgical 
team but drew a harsh reaction from some medical professionals and 
the public 
cooley was censured by the harris county medical society for 
publicity which meant violating the societys guidelines about 
having a physicians name appear in a newspaper in connection with 
the name of a patient 
all the theoretical objections really almost killed the 
transplant program that coupled with the high incidence of tissue 
rejection which brought a lot of bad news to the profession 
cooley said 
since then however the antirejection drug cyclosporine came 
into use and advanced artificial hearts have improved survival 
until donor hearts can be found and greater public acceptance has 
made donor organs more plentiful 
however new obstacles have emerged including burdensome 
federal regulations that limit the application of medical research 
said dr oh frazier who directs the cardiovascular surgical 
research lab at the texas heart institute 
im not sure today if that first step wasnt taken in 1969 how 
we would take it today frazier said 
cooley agrees that regulations make research applications more 
difficult today but he believes the food and drug administration 
is not directly to blame 
i know that the individuals at the fda who are responsible 
for these restrictions are people who are well motivated but they 
are responding basically to what the public seems to want cooley 
said 
i dont believe we ought to live in a completely unregulated 
society but i think that our restrictions should be liberal enough 
that progress can be made

the disaster expert whose crew saved two 
montana towns from last summers yellowstone firestorms now is 
plotting to defend another national park against the largest oil 
spill in us history 
our mission is to find out where the marine wildlife and sea 
birds are today then set priorities so the oil that kills them can 
try to be contained said dave liebersbach a veteran bureau of 
land management troubleshooter whose title is incident commander 
liebersbachs team has found similarities here to yellowstone 
in yellowstone we put firefighters on the ground here were 
providing logistics for phd biologists who were handling as a 
very intelligent resource very delicately if they need a boat we 
get one if they need a ham sandwich we make one what they need we 
try to provide liebersbach said 
the tanker exxon valdez hit a reef near valdez on good friday 
night and bled 101 million gallons of crude oil into prince 
william sound huge fingers of the slick are now extending westward 
through montague strait toward the 660501acre kenai fjord 
national park 
the oil was less than 10 miles offshore from seward on sunday 
night but calm seas and gentle breezes made its future course 
unpredictable 
its possible it could miss everything here said 
liebersbach but to ignore it would be totally negligent knowing 
what we do we have to prepare to mitigate it 
created by the alaska national interest lands conservation act 
of 1980 the new national park is a necklace of bird rookeries 
tidal pools and whale playgrounds draped along 610 miles of the 
kenai peninsulas eastern coastline 
located 100 air miles southeast of anchorage most of the park 
can be reached only by floatplane or boat it attracted fewer than 
60000 hardy tourists last year and is more hospitable to its 
critters than its visitors 
among the animals who cavort in the midnight sun amid the rugged 
grandeur of the parks coves and inlets are many endangered 
humpback and california gray whales a few endangered fin whales 
and otters sea lions and seals 
liebersbach is in charge of a 40memberandgrowing team of 
pilots support personnel and environmental experts drawn from 
alaska agencies the us forest service national park service 
bureau of land management and us fish and wildlife service 
although liebersbachs home is fairbanks he was at a meeting of 
the governments 18 class 1 disaster incident commanders in reno 
nev when his permanent eightman core unit was activated at the 
request of the park service 
the last time we were together was yellowstone on the storm 
creek fire said liebersbach we didnt expect to see each 
other again until summer 
last august and september he was boss to several thousand 
civilian and military firefighters who faced down 200foot walls of 
flame threatening to incinerate silver gate and cooke city mont 
the two towns were saved but yellowstones fires charred nearly one 
million acres 
marvin robertson the teams planning chief said the spill 
woke us all up and got us ready for the year it looks like it 
could be a long one 
the team set up shop in a small house near park headquarters in 
seward up went the topographical maps in came the photocopy 
machine typewriters and coffeemaker seven phone lines now ring 
constantly from dawn until midnight 
an oil slick is like a fire line it just keeps moving said 
robertson

a group of leading latin american writers 
artists and scholars has told president jose sarney of brazil he 
will bear historical responsibility for continued destruction 
of the amazon rain forest 
we believe that the historical responsibility for destroying 
the amazon jungle is very great and future generations of latin 
americans will not forgive it if everything possible is not done to 
avoid it the group of 100 warned un a letter which was released 
monday 
sarney has rejected international criticism of the deforestation 
of the amazon basin as foreign interference in brazilian affairs 
the group of 100 declared that to invoke national sovereignty 
to justify crimes against nature like those being committed 
against one of the richest and most complex ecosystems on earth 
appears puerile and dishonest to us 
the group condemned criminal burning that razes millions of 
acres of tropical forests the clearing of the jungle for 
colonization and transnational agriculture and the 
extermination of ethnic groups whose members are hunted down by the 
modernizers of agriculture to take over their lands 
the letter signed by 28 leading latin american writers and 
artists was delivered to the brazilian embassy by group president 
and poet homer aridjis 
among its signatories are carlos fuentes of mexico gabriel 
garcia marquez of colombia juan carlos onetti of uruguay isabel 
allende widow of the slain chilean president salvador allende

the museum of state security displays the scorched 
tail of a small plane plastic explosives a tattered 2506 brigade 
armband assault rifles a radio transmitter and a battered water 
can with a label in english 
the artifacts are part of what cuba presents as its 30year 
struggle with the central intelligence agency and dissident cubans 
accused of trying to kill or overthrow president fidel castro 
the museum which opened this weekend occupies a refurbished 
mansion in a oncewealthy neighborhood whose villas now house 
embassies or government offices 
in a small plaza visible from the street a power boat with a 
black hull sea blue decks and florida markings looks at first 
glance like a private plaything in a country where such luxuries 
are rare 
closer examination reveals that the boat driven by powerful 
mercury engines has heavy machine guns mounted fore and aft 
octavio cruz the cleancut graying guide at the museum said 
the vessel made coastal raids until it was captured by agents of 
the state security department castros special police force 
maps inside the museum are dotted with sites of imperialist 
aggression a battle plan for the ussponsored bay of pigs 
debacle in 1961 there are a rogues gallery of people accused of 
trying to kill castro and relics of what is portrayed as a secret 
war on the regime he established 30 years ago 
at the center of an upstairs room in its own sealed plexiglas 
case is a threevolume set of the yellowbound proceedings of a 
senate intelligence committee investigation of 1975 
the committee investigation disclosed bungled cia attempts on 
castros life once with an exploding cigar for instance and 
another time with poison powder that supposedly was scattered on 
the leaders clothing but did no harm 
asked why the evidence was not displayed cruz first said 
there have been so many attempts they couldnt all be put in the 
museum later he said he wasnt sure the evidence still existed 
he led the visitors into the hall of martyrs lined with 
portraits of 88 agents of state security described as having died 
fighting the cia cuban exiles counterrevolutionaries or other 
enemies a brass plaque beneath each portrait gave the details 
cruz said the museums purpose is to bring to the people a 
cultural identity and to transmit a story for all visitors 
fundamentally about a fight and the atrocities carried out against 
us and the aggressions of the last century 
asked why a meseum opened now to depict events of the 1960s 
cruz said the opportunity is now and in the past the 
revolution had other priorities 
in first room of the museum are a giant photo of the us marine 
landing at santiago de cuba in 1898 during the spanishamerican 
war and a huge copy of a letter written in 1895 by jose marti 
patron saint of cuban independence marti said the united states 
would continue to use cuba as a base to extend its power into the 
caribbean 
the only other exhibit in that room is an enlargement of a 
letter castro wrote in 1958 from a camp in the hills telling his 
longtime friend and secretary celia sanchez theyre firing 
rockets at us in the mountains mario was killed and the americans 
will pay dearly for this 
he also wrote just a year before gaining power its becoming 
clear to me that this war will go on much longer it will have to 
go on against the americans

exxon apologized and promised compensation 
for causing the nations biggest oil spill which on monday forced 
alaska to shut down its 12 million herring fishery in prince 
william sound for the season 
new york state police meanwhile said they expected the 
surrender tuesday of joseph hazelwood the former captain of the 
tanker that spilled 101 million gallons of north slope crude after 
it crashed into bligh reef on march 24 
we have reason to believe hell present himself at the state 
police barracks in east farmingdale said state police spokesman 
trooper craig rubio in a telephone interview monday evening 
an arrest warrant has been issued in alaska for hazelwood the 
huntington ny resident is accused of misdemeanor charges of 
operating a ship while under the influence of alcohol reckless 
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil 
the oil slick has now grown larger than rhode island the state 
fish and game department announced monday that the prince william 
sound herring fishery which generates 12 million in annual 
revenues will not open this year officials have previously closed 
the sounds sablefish and shrimp fisheries 
more than half the spawning habitat used by prince william sound 
herring has been fouled said dennis haanpaa a fisheries biologist 
with the department that bodes ill for both the fish and the 
fishermen who tend to catch herring near their spawning ground 
altogether the prince william sound fishing industry is worth 
more than 150 million annually 
in fullpage advertisements placed in newspapers around the 
country monday exxon chairman lawrence g rawl said i want to 
tell you how sorry i am that this accident took place 
rawls statement also appeared to respond to harsh criticism 
from alaskan officials fishermen and environmentalists who accuse 
exxon of reacting slowly and inadequately to the spill 
we believe that exxon has moved swiftly and competently to 
minimize the effect this oil will have on the environment fish and 
other wildlife he said rawl also offered to meet our 
obligations to all those who have suffered damage from the spill 
four class action lawsuits already have been filed against exxon 
at the outset of what could be years of litigation over the 
accident 
in an interview from the companys headquarters in new york 
exxon president lee r raymond said he hopes the emotional type 
of atmosphere generated by the spill does not prompt congress to 
reject the oil industrys request to drill in protected wildlife 
areas 
however that could be precisely the outcome of the spill 
interior secretary manuel lujan suggested in a speech to the 
national ocean industries association in washington 
if the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails 
among the us public then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil 
and gas development in the arctic national wildlife refuge 
offshore and in the public lands lujan said 
more than 1000 seabirds and at least 20 sea otters caught in 
the oil have died some found covered with asphalthard oil 
officials said the death toll is probably much higher but they 
have had time to survey only a slice of the sounds 2500 miles of 
coastline 
department of fish and game spokesman jon lyman said monday a 
deer found dead on naked island about 25 miles southwest of the 
tanker had apparently eaten contaminated food an indication of how 
rapidly the spill was spreading 
thats bad news thats the top of the food chain lyman 
said 
on nearby green island hundreds of birds lay along the beach 
as black and lifeless as the oilsmeared rocks around them 
sheltered coves and rocky points usually clamoring with the sound 
of gulls and other shorebirds were silent 
every day its getting a little worse otter rescue 
specialist chris donohoe said as he squatted by a dead sea duck 
you clean a beach up the tide changes and the oil comes right 
back 
oil is so thick that walking on once postcardperfect beaches is 
treacherous and workers wear hardhats to protect against injuries 
from frequent tumbles on rocks oil sprayed by waves splatters 
rocks and driftwood logs high above the tideline beaches smell 
like gas station garages 
in sawmill bay 11 miles west of valdez fishermen said monday 
they battling to keep oil away from 2 million salmon at a hatchery 
a sheen of oil has worked its way inside a plastic boom stretched 
across the bay they said 
exxon officials have conceded that beach cleanup efforts so far 
have been futile but the company said it began a new assault with 
more effective gear more workers and a floating command post 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi said exxon planned to 
flush beaches by pumping seawater over them then collect oil from 
the water with skimmers 
we intend not to leave until the job is done iarossi said 
we intend to leave prince william sound close to what it was 
before the tragedy 
state officials have blasted exxons effort to scrub beaches as 
dismal and ineffective less than 4 percent of the thick crude has 
been recovered 
the spill has fouled more than 800 miles of shoreline in prince 
william sound and the amount grows each day 
hazelwood 42 was fired by exxon last week the skipper 
admitted drinking before boarding the exxon valdez according to 
court documents blood and urine samples taken nine hours after the 
accident indicated he was drunk 
larry weeks director of criminal prosecution for the state of 
alaska said authorities in alaska have had communication with a 
lawyer in new york representing hazelwood 
the tanker accident forced reductions in the flow of oil through 
the alaskan pipeline which carries nearly onequarter of the 
united states domestic supply of crude oil 
alyeska pipeline service co said the flow was increased sunday 
evening with word from the coast guard that tanker traffic would 
soon be allowed to return to normal 
however the coast guard decided monday to reinstate 
daytimeonly restrictions on oil tanker traffic in prince william 
sound after state officials raised concerns spokesman rick meidt 
said 
night traffic was allowed sunday for the first time since the 
exxon valdez one of the two largest tankers in exxons us fleet 
ran aground but after a monday meeting the coast guard decided to 
again limit traffic until all agencies are satisfied that alyeska 
the operator of the valdez terminal has the equipment to handle 
another spill meidt said 
if something were to happen lets make sure we have enough 
gear there to respond he said 
the pipeline usually carries 2 million barrels of crude a day 
that had been reduced to 800000 barrels a day causing shortages 
at west coast refineries and sending oil prices higher 
by monday morning the pipeline flow had been increased to 13 
million barrels a day spokesman john ratterman said pipeline 
company officials said they didnt expect the latest restrictions 
in tanker traffic to force another cutback in flow

a barge carrying 160000 gallons of 
lye capsized on the ohio river on monday and authorities were 
trying to salvage the craft without a major spill state and 
federal officials said 
a spokesman for the us coast guard said small amounts of a 50 
percent lye solution also known as sodium hydroxide or caustic 
soda could be seeping through vents in the barge 
common sense tells us you assume theres some seepage said 
lt commander arthur adkins of the us coast guard at huntington 
wva but none has been detected 
because of its high alkalinity lye is considered a hazardous 
chemical that could endanger aquatic life and drinking water 
officials said 
the barge owned by ppg industries inc was one of 15 being 
transported by a tugboat around a sharp bend in the ohio river at 
long bottom ohio and murraysville wva it broke away from the 
other vessels and drifted close to the rocky shore before running 
aground between parkersburg and ravenswood adkins said 
the outer shell of the 195foot barge was punctured by a rock 
shortly before 9 am monday adkins said the space between the 
two hulls flooded and the barge capsized 
kemron laboratories a marietta ohio company hired by ppg 
monday to monitor the incident did not detect an alkalinity 
increase in the water surrounding the barge 
it would almost take a catastrophic release to pose a major 
threat adkins said 
in high concentrations such as the barge is carrying lye will 
burn skin and eyes adkins said swallowing it can be dangerous he 
said 
drinking water could be infected so water intake users 
downstream have been notified he said 
the cleanup and removal of the barge is expected to take several 
weeks ppgs salvage expert from lake charles la was to arrive 
early tuesday adkins said

boston is chief floral gardener for the national park service in 
downtown washington the generalissimo with rake and hoe who 
oversees the yearlong planting of 170 flower beds from the capitol 
to the kennedy center 
his job might seem staggering to backyard putterers for a month 
in late fall the efficient unflappable boston and his crew of 
eight gardeners were busy planting 186150 tulips 108300 
daffodils and 22000 pansies all of which bloom in the spring 
those flowers are removed by early may the soil is tilled 
fumigated with weed and pest killers conditioned with perlite and 
peat moss and planted with bright hardy annuals for washingtons 
hot summer months they are weeded and fertilized until they die in 
the first frost they are replaced by about 3000 crysanthemums 
then the beds are cleared and the cycle starts again in november 
boston a 26year park service veteran is especially proud of 
the tulip library a broad looping cluster of 95 small beds of 
the proud clarions of spring that lies near the tidal basin south 
of the washington monument 
this elaborate garden contains 15000 tulips most of them 
imported from holland each of the 95 beds containing a different 
variety with names as dazzling as their colors queen of night 
merry widow apeldoorn oriental splendor smiling queen flaming 
parrot estella rijnveld 
its so impressive that it won an admiring tribute from the 
dutch embassy 
boston says he gets great satisfaction from his handiwork 
which delights more than 23 million tourists who visit washingtons 
national parks and monuments each year 
this is always what i wanted to do said boston 45 who 
grew up on his fathers farm in eastern north carolina and migrated 
to washington after high school all my life ive been used to 
growing things 
his annual 330000 budget includes the cost of plants and bulbs 
purchased wholesale from growers many from neighboring maryland 
and virginia on the basis of competitive bids and shipped into the 
capital by truck or van 
during plantings bostons crew begins work at 6 am and can 
leave a flower bed blazing with color before the morning rush hour 
is over he says he couldnt meet his grueling timetable for the 
passing seasons without his eight park service helpers 
they really work hard and do a good job he said theyre 
all gardeners and they know what theyre doing they can plant 
20000 bulbs in one day 
in a city beset by violent crimes boston is pleased that his 
flowers are almost never stolen except by an occasional panhandler 
intent on selling them for spare change 
i guess people enjoy them so they dont take them he said 
about the only problem is when people stand in the beds to pose 
for pictures and mash the flowers down 
boston says he once had the bestlooking yard in the 
neighborhood in suburban capitol heights md where he lives 
with his wife and two children but in this job i dont have the 
time any more to take care of it 
his loss is washingtons gain

the government says it will force us 
airlines to take stricter antiterrorism measures but people who 
lost loved ones in the bombing of pan am flight 103 say the actions 
arent strong enough 
on the 103rd day after the bombing the transportation 
department announced orders requiring devices to detect plastic 
explosives and stricter compliance with aviation security warnings 
after flight 103 relatives met with president bush 
the white house meeting on monday which was scheduled for 20 
minutes but lasted an hour began a day of emotionfilled 
activities at nearby lafayette park congress and a washington 
church by scores of relatives and friends of the 270 people killed 
in the dec 21 explosion of the boeing 747 over lockerbie scotland 
the relatives called for a fullscale congressional 
investigation to determine what and where the breakdowns were 
that led to the preventable massacre at 31000 feet 
bert ammerman of demarest nj spokesman for the relatives 
said action announced by transportation secretary samuel skinner 
was a positive step forward we applaud the secretary but its 
not enough skinner was in the meeting with the relatives and 
bush 
ammerman said all checked and carried baggage should be 
handsearched until devices are installed that can detect plastic 
explosives such as the one believed to have blown up flight 103 as 
it was headed from london to new york 
the relatives also proposed better training and pay for airport 
inspectors and public disclosure of terrorist threats 
our loved ones were not given the freedom to make a rational 
decision regarding their fate based on all the available facts 
ammerman said 
we realize that we will never again be able to laugh cry or 
talk with our loved ones he told several hundred people in the 
park but we are determined to do everything in our power to 
prevent this senseless and preventable tragedy from occurring 
again 
skinner at a news conference outlined new orders affecting 
us airlines including required installation of plastic 
explosivedetection systems such as thermal neutron analysis 
devices at highrisk airport throughout the world at the 
earliest feasible date 
the government already has ordered six of the nearly 1 million 
machines for installation at various airports before the end of the 
year but skinner gave no timetable for carrying out the new order 
which would involve 100 or more airports 
he said it will require some negotiations with foreign 
governments a federal aviation administration official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said it could take years for full 
compliance with the order 
other steps ordered by skinner include mandatory airline 
acknowledgement and compliance with security bulletins that warn of 
possible threats against aviation an increase in faa personnel 
assigned to key us and foreign airports and upgrading of airport 
xray equipment 
skinner however said a public warning system when there are 
security threats saying it would cripple intelligence efforts to 
combat terrorists 
we must balance the needs of the american people and the 
industry to know with the need to gather meaningful significant 
relevant information skinner said 
he said bush told relatives he would look into the possibility 
of a unified congressional investigation into the explosion but 
skinner said he would recommend against he said government 
response has been adequate and the fbi and scotland yard are 
capable of solving the crime 
the air transport association which represents major us 
airlines said it supported skinners initiatives but spokesman 
tim neale said the airlines believe the government not the 
airlines should pay for new detection equipment from the growing 
aviation trust fund 
skinner estimated fares might increase from 20 cents to a dollar 
per ticket but said the requirements would not cause serious delays 
the association said any increased security measures should also 
apply to foreign airlines which carry about half of the americans 
traveling abroad

an agriculture department economist says 
federal emergency aid probably helped stabilize land values in 
the midwest last year after drought ravaged crops across the 
region 
gregory hanson of the departments economic research service 
said that surveys by the farm credit banks of st paul minn 
indicate that land prices did not decline in michigan north dakota 
or wisconsin in june through november last year 
other surveys indicate that farmland prices rose in the corn 
belt in 1988 he said real estate is the main source of loan 
collateral for farmers 
while drought assistance has helped stabilize the agricultural 
economy the usda estimates that 10000 to 15000 commercial farms 
faced loan repayment problems due to crop losses hanson said 
these stressed farmers represent 15 percent to 25 percent of 
all commercial farms 
the disaster assistance act of 1988 was signed into law last 
aug 11 as the scorching summer drought was still at its peak the 
law provided up to 39 billion in federal aid and other measures 
to help farmers recover 
hanson writing in the april issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said that federal disaster assistance may turn out to be 
less than foreseen last fall because crop losses were smaller 
than expected 
also qualification for drought assistance was based on the 
wholefarm average yield for each crop rather than on a 
fieldbyfield basis he said the averagingup of yields 
where good fields offset poorer fields excluded some farmers from 
qualifying in areas with scattered rainfall 
even so hanson added the combination of drought assistance and 
federal subsidized crop insurance has permitted thousands of 
farmers in hardhit states to survive last years bad weather with 
less financial suffering than had been anticipated 
hanson said a full assessment of federal drought aid and 
insurance benefits cannot be completed until all payments and 
indemnities have been disbursed but preliminary figures show those 
had substantial stabilizing effects in the hardesthit drought 
areas 
but on capitol hill there have been grumblings that usda has 
mishandled 1988 relief and has ignored drought conditions now 
prevailing in parts of the great plains notably in kansas and 
parts of texas 
department officials testified that more than 558000 producers 
had received disaster payments and emergency feed assistance 
amounting to more than 27 billion nationally 
in his report hanson said that as of early february more than 
2 billion in drought payments and almost 1 billion in federal 
crop insurance benefits had been paid to farmers in the top eight 
states 
farmers in montana and the dakotas where more than 80 percent 
of the commercial farms were in droughtstricken counties have 
received nearly a third of the drought payments made so far 
benefits paid to the eight states as of early february in 
millions of dollars included drought aid in the first column 
federal crop insurance in the second and the total in the third

american ketchup makers and other tomato 
processors will have a japanese competitor bidding for farmers 
crops says an agriculture department report 
the kogome co ltd japans largest tomato processing company 
announced it will open a 20 million plant next year in los banos 
calif to manufacture tomato products and fruit juice beverages 
most if not all of the manufactured products likely will be 
exported to japan to take advantage of future market openings for 
tomato and fruit drink products achieved under a recent usjapan 
agreement the departments foreign agricultural service said 
the agreement gives us exporters of 11 product categories 
including processed tomato products and fruit juices greater sale 
opportunities in japan 
bryand h wadsworth us agricultural counselor in tokyo said 
the plant will produce institutionalsize containers tomato ketchup 
from tomato paste bought from local manufacturers 
in addition he said the plant will produce retailsize

the agriculture department says the us dry 
bean situation has completely reversed itself from a year ago 
because of higher prices prompted by the 1988 drought 
by january the average farm price of dry edible beans was 
2960 per hundredweight up from 1340 a year earlier 
price increases were the greatest for beans hit hardest by the 
drought for example grower prices for navy beans in the week of 
jan 24 averaged 32 per hundredweight compared with around 10 in 
january 1988 the departments economic research service said 
total us output of dry beans dropped 26 percent to 192 
million hundredweight last year the agency reported 
the sharpest decreases in production were for red kidney 
pintos and navies the beans grown in states with less 
irrigation the report said 
another price factor is an improved outlook for bean exports 
because of poor harvests in several major importing countries 
including mexico and japan 
domestic demand for beans could also improve this year because 
of recent media attention and industry promotional efforts the 
report said beans are a nutritious food item and are noted for 
their fiber content

ethics not increased security are the best 
defense against computer worms like the one unleashed last fall 
by a cornell university graduate student a school official said 
a special university commission reported monday that robert t 
morris jr acted alone and with reckless disregard on nov 2 
when he launched a debilitating program into the internet network 
causing thousands of computers around the country to clog and 
overload 
the commission concluded that morris did not intend for the worm 
to destroy data or files but that he did want it to spread widely 
it said the program was not technically a virus a program 
that inserts itself into a host program to propagate but was a 
worm an independent program that replicates itself once placed 
in a computer system 
release of the worm was not a heroic event that pointed up the 
weaknesses of operating systems contrary to morris claim the 
commission wrote the panel also denied that morris was a genius 
for creating the worm it said although the worm was technically 
sophisticated it could have been created by many students 
in fact morris juvenile act did little to provide insights 
into the already wellknown security flaws of the internet system 
a national research network used by universities industry and 
government said m stuart lynn cornells vice president of 
technologies 
lynn and cornell provost robert barker said the incidents 
greatest impact was the breach of trust it had caused among 
researchers who use the network however both cautioned that 
employing drastic security steps was not a solution to prevent 
similar incidents 
violations of such a trust cannot be condoned said lynn 
a community of scholars shouldnt have to build skyhigh walls in 
order to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy particularly 
when such walls would impede the free flow of information and 
ideas 
lynn added that its unlikely any security steps could guarantee 
an impenetrable system in a community of individuals possessed of 
all the knowledge and skills required to scale the highest 
barriers 
instead the cornell officials stressed the need for improved 
awareness of computer ethics said lynn 
i dont think one can ever feel confident by putting bigger 
and tighter locks on the door said lynn thats why its 
important to stress ethical considerations 
morris who is on a leave of absence from school declined to be 
interviewed by the commission which was left to speculate as to 
the reasons he created the worm 
the panel made no recommendation about disciplinary action 
against the firstyear graduate student in cornells doctoral 
computer program barker said morris case would be reviewed by a 
panel of graduate students and faculty that could permanently bar 
him from the university 
morris 23 of arnold md remains under investigation by a 
federal grand jury in syracuse and the justice department in 
washington dc

the expanding shipboard set that dominates 
benjamin brittens billy budd at the metropolitan opera is so 
spectacular that the work would almost be worth reviving just for 
the chance to see it in action 
luckily there was also quite a bit of a musical nature to hold 
the interest monday night when the company presented the john 
dexter production for the first time in several seasons 
herman melvilles classic tale revolves around three sharply 
drawn characters who inspired some of brittens most memorable 
music billy budd the good and handsome sailor john claggart the 
evil masteratarms who is bent on his destruction and edward 
vere the philosophical captain who reluctantly sends billy to his 
death to preserve law and order 
two of the three roles were in excellent hands baritone thomas 
allen made a firstrate billy conveying first his youth and 
enthusiasm and later his pathos when chained and awaiting 
execution he sings a haunting ballad as vere tenor james king 
made a moving figure especially in the prologue and epilogue where 
he appears as an old man musing about the distant past 
another composer might have made billy a tenor the vocal part 
traditionally associated with a young hero but in melvilles 
ambiguous narrative captain vere may be the real hero and 
brittens decision to make him the tenor seems to acknowledge this 
the malevolent claggart is portrayed more conventionally as a 
deep bass janhendrik rootering looked sinister enough but his 
goodsized voice lacked the bite and menace that james morris 
brought to the part when the production was new 
the mens chorus which has a major role in the allmale cast 
performed lustily and the orchestra played well under conductor 
thomas fulton 
but it was above all the set designed by william dudley that 
commanded admiration with the aid of the mets elaborate system of 
stage elevators the ship expands and shrinks like an accordion as 
the action shifts from the maindeck to the captains cabin to 
the quarterdeck to the lower gundeck 
the effect is fittingly to make the ship itself the dominant 
image in the opera a microcosm where the battle between good and 
evil is played out to its tragic conclusion

opponents of capital punishment are pressing 
district of columbia mayor marion barry to block the extradition of 
a juvenile sought by alabama until hes assured the youth wont 
face the death penalty 
but barry so far has refused to interject himself publicly into 
the extradition case involving a 17yearold black youth charged in 
the may 1988 firebombing of a gadsden ala apartment a 
14monthold black child died in the fire 
rick blake the mayors deputy press secretary said barry would 
not respond to pleas made at a monday news conference by a group 
of death penalty opponents and church leaders that he refuse to 
honor alabamas extradition request unless state authorities 
guarantee the youth identified by the initials om will not be 
charged with a capital crime 
while barry has remained silent lawyers for the district 
government have supported alabamas bid to extradite the youth who 
has been held in washington since his arrest in december on a 
fugitive warrant from alabama 
superior court judge stephen f eilperin last week granted 
alabamas extradition request but he stayed his order until today 
to allow the youths attorneys to appeal an appeal was filed 
friday with the district of columbia court of appeals which 
extended the stay until april 10 
alvin j bronstein director of the national prison project of 
the american civil liberties union said barry can supersede the 
court ruling and block the extradition until alabama promises not 
to seek the death penalty 
bronstein charged that barry by allowing his government to 
support the extradition has forgotten the values that motivated 
him 25 years ago when he worked for racial justice in the south 
as a member of the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc 
bronstein who was an attorney for sncc members during the civil 
rights movement said he was issuing a personal plea to the mayor 
dont send this youngster back without the kinds of guarantees 
that will ensure us that he wont be killed in jail that he will 
be treated in a decent fashion and that he wont face the death 
penalty 
if alabama refuses to make such guarantees then bronstein said 
the district should release the youth because there are no other 
outstanding charges against him 
oms attorneys contend he cannot get a fair trial from the 
white authorities of etowah county ala because of their 
longstanding vendetta against his family both the boys father 
and uncle died while in police custody 
another of the boys uncles has been charged with murder and 
arson in connection with the 1988 firebombing om is charged 
under juvenile law as an accessory to the firebombing and thus is 
not facing an immediate threat of the death penalty 
but alabama authorities have refused to rule out the possiblity 
that he might be tried as an adult and subjected to the death 
penalty

president bush scoffs at the notion that his 
seasonopening pitch to orioles catcher mickey tettleton was a 
high and wide he caught it before it started breaking bush

law enforcement officials are armed with new 
support from the supreme court to fight drug smuggling by air 
travelers 
the justices on monday made it easier for authorities to stop 
question and search airline passengers who fit socalled 
profiles of possible drug couriers 
by a 72 vote the court ordered the reinstatement of a drug 
possession conviction of a man carrying 1000 grams of cocaine when 
he was stopped by authorities at the honolulu airport 
were pleased and happy that weve been upheld by the supreme 
court said cornelius dougherty spokesman for the drug 
enforcement administration 
the justices upheld the deas case against andrew sokolow who 
was stopped because his behavior and dress matched a profile 
the agency uses to identify suspected drug couriers 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
there were sufficient factors to lead agents to reasonably suspect 
sokolow was engaged in criminal activity 
the fact that these factors may be set forth in a profile 
does not somehow detract from their evidentiary significance as 
seen by a trained agent rehnquist said 
in a dissenting opinion justice thurgood marshall said the 
ruling likely will lead to questioning and detaining innocent 
people 
reflexive reliance on a profile of drug courier 
characteristics runs a far greater risk than does ordinary 
casebycase police work of subjecting innocent individuals to 
unawarranted police harassment and detention he said 
marshall was joined by justice william j brennan 
attorney general dick thornburgh hailed the ruling saying it 
validates an effective practice to crack down on drug 
trafficking 
without this tool our antidrug effort could be significantly 
hampered thornburgh said in a statement by upholding the 
profile practice the supreme court has struck a strong blow in 
support of law enforcements war on drugs 
sokolow was stopped by dea agents on july 25 1984 as he 
returned to hawaii from a trip to miami 
authorities said he aroused their suspicions three days earlier 
when he and a female companion departed from honolulu airport for 
miami 
they said sokolow who appeared to be in his mid20s bought his 
plane tickets with 2100 in cash taken from a roll of money that 
appeared to contain more than 4000 he was wearing a black 
jumpsuit and a great deal of gold jewelry appeared nervous and he 
and the woman with him carried four handbags on the plane without 
checking any luggage 
the agents also suspected he was using an alias because the name 
he gave the ticket agent was not the same as the name listed for 
the telephone number he gave the agent 
such behavior dress and demeanor fit the profile of a drug 
courier narcotics agents said 
sokolow pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to 
distribute and was sentenced to five years in prison he appealed 
the conviction on grounds the cocaine should have been suppressed 
as evidence because authorities violated his constitutional rights 
against unlawful search and seizure when they stopped him in 
honolulu 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals threw out the conviction 
ruling that suspicion of a crime cannot be intuited from a 
hodgepodge assembly of factors about individual character 
but the supreme court said the accumulated factors weighed by 
the agents were enough to permit them to question sokolow and 
detain him they subsequently obtained a search warrant after a 
police dog indicated a handbag contained narcotics 
any one of these factors is not by itself proof of any illegal 
conduct and is quite consistent with innocent travel rehnquist 
said but we think taken together they amount to reasonable 
suspicion 
for example rehnquist said traveling from hawaii to miami may 
not be suspicious but he said surely few residents of honolulu 
travel from that city for 20 hours to spend 48 hours in miami 
during the month of july 
the use of drug courier profiles has survived previous high 
court scrutiny mondays ruling may give authorities a freer hand 
to use them 
in other action the court 
ruled in a case from dallas that there is no generalized 
right of social association and allowed communities to protect 
young teenagers by banning anyone over 18 from some dance halls 
ruled by a 63 vote in a mississippi case that state courts 
lack the authority to approve adoptions of indian babies by 
nonindians even when the natural parents leave the reservation to 
give up the children 
sending the case back to a tribal court for more study the 
justices said tribal rights and indian culture take precedence over 
individual rights in such circumstances 
agreed to decide whether a baltimore woman may be jailed for 
refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her young son who 
authorities fear may be dead

the nations largest teachers union today 
called for 10 billion in new federal spending to counter a 
shocking erosion in education programs for the disadvantaged and 
handicapped 
these programs reach only a fraction of the young people they 
were meant to serve mary futrell president of the national 
education association said in issuing a report called federal 
education funding present realities and future needs 
in state after state the numbers in our new report clearly 
demonstrate a shocking erosion of federal support for these 
essential programs futrell said in a statement nothing could 
be more impractical for our nation than continuing this systematic 
underfunding 
futrell said the nea report contains the first estimates of what 
it would cost to serve all students currently eligible for help 
under four of the most important federal education programs 
nea has more than 19 million members across the country its 
report comes as congress prepares to tackle the fiscal 1990 budget 
the report looks specifically at chapter 1 grants to bolster 
basic skills among disadvantaged youngsters the education for all 
handicapped act which helps states educate disabled youngsters 
bilingual education grants to make sure students with native 
languages other than english succeed in school and pell grants for 
college students from lowincome families 
the most serious erosion appears to have occurred in chapter 1 
the nea report said the number of students served dropped from 7 
million in 198081 to 57 million in 198889 at the same time the 
number of children in poverty swelled so while the program reached 
65 percent of eligible students in 198081 it reached only 40 
percent by 1986 
for fiscal 1989 the group said congress provided 46 billion 
for chapter 1 enough to serve 47 percent of eligible students to 
serve the estimated 85 million who will qualify next year would 
cost about 69 billion a 23 billion increase over current 
levels 
the authors of the 1974 handicapped act intended that the 
federal government would ultimately pay 40 percent of its cost to 
local school districts but the federal share started at 12 percent 
and stayed there until 1980 and by fiscal 1989 had dropped to 7 
percent nea said 
to reach the 40 percent target would cost 84 billion a 65 
billion hike over current levels the report said and though 
funding has doubled since 1980 merely restoring the federal share 
to 12 percent would cost an extra 700 million 
the bilingual education program currently serves one in 18 of 
students who need help in english language skills nea said an 
increase of more than 1 billion would be needed to serve the 16 
million students states report as eligible the group said 
while funds for pell grants have increased slightly when 
adjusted for inflation the increases have not come near matching 
the soaring costs of postsecondary education nea said it also 
said congress has fallen far short of meeting its own 
authorized funding level for the individual grants another 600 
million would be needed to fully fund the maximum 2900 pell 
grants permitted in fiscal 1990 the teacher union said 
higher academic standards and a greater emphasis on analysis and 
problemsolving are doomed to failure unless schools and 
communities can maintain programs to help all students meet those 
standards the report said it says the solution given state and 
local economic constraints is to fully restore the federal share 
of support for public education 
the nea report was based on charts provided by federal planning 
services inc of washington dc an independent statistical 
analysis firm

a group that lobbies for poor people says 
president bushs proposal to immediately slash 829 million in 
domestic spending would fall heavily on the needy 
bush is asking congress to make the reductions to help pay for 
22 billion in new 1989 spending he is seeking in other areas 
including funds for veterans and for foster care 
the center on budget and policy priorities an advocacy group 
for the needy said that based on its analysis of bushs proposal 
270 million in cuts would come from programs that provide 
education job training health and other assistance to the poor 
the priorities reflected in these proposals raise questions 
about whether the talk of a kinder and gentler america largely 
represents a rhetorical attempt at imagemaking said the 
centers director robert greenstein in a written statement 
under bushs plan more than 1000 domestic programs excluding 
those he considers top priority would be slashed by nearly 11 
percent across the board 
the details of bushs request made available by the house 
appropriations committee and the white houses office of management 
and budget did not specify which programs would be affected by the 
proposed cuts 
but the center saying it based its figures on data from omb 
said 270 million of the proposed cuts would come from programs for 
the poor the center said this would include 64 million in cuts in 
financial aid to needy students 50 million for compensatory 
education for poor children and 41 million for job training 
overall the center said the sharpest cuts would fall on the 
departments of education 185 million health and human services 
88 million and agriculture 80 million 
the savings from the cuts bush is seeking would help finance 
increases the president wants in dozens of domestic programs for 
fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 even though most budget decisions 
are made before a fiscal year begins presidents often seek 
additional spending in the middle of the year 
included in bushs request for new spending is about 850 
million to pay for costofliving increases for veterans and their 
survivors and for other department of veterans affairs programs 
the president is also seeking 400 million to repay states for 
their foster care efforts 100 million to pay for increased 
refugees entering this country from the soviet union africa and 
southeast asia and 55 million for the governments uranium 
program 
in addition bush is asking congress to provide 892 million it 
has already committed itself to spending for the guaranteed student 
loan program for college students 
bush sent his request to congress on march 24 when lawmakers 
were on their easter recess they return tuesday 
in his package bush told the lawmakers he would later submit a 
request for about 50 million in aid to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels and 454 million to help bail out the nations teetering 
savings and loan associations

congress this week celebrates a curious but 
important milestone the 200th anniversary of the days on which the 
first house and first senate achieved a quorum and were finally 
ready to begin the work of the new nation 
the house marks the occasion today april 4 three days after 
the actual april 1 anniversary the senate celebrates on thursday 
april 6 the actual date of its first working quorum 
commemorative postage stamps will be issued honoring the 
bicentennials of both houses 
the congress established under the constitution first convened 
in new york city on march 4 1789 
but the absence of the required majority plus one prevented the 
two chambers from getting down to business 
on that first day only 13 of the 59 house members and only eight 
of the 22 senators were in attendance 
election complications bad weather muddy roads and just plain 
sloth get the blame as causes for the delay 
the journal of the house noted with monotonous regularity that 
a quorum of the members not being present the house adjourned 
congress under the discarded articles of confederation had been 
noted for absenteeism and near paralysis and many feared history 
was about to repeat itself 
we lose credit spirit everything rep fisher ames of 
massachusetts wrote to a friend in boston the public will forget 
the government before it is born 
the senators who had managed to reach new york wrote to their 
absent colleagues we apprehend that no arguments are necessary 
to evince to you the indispensable necessity of putting the 
government into immediate operation and therefore ernestly request 
that you will be so obliging as to attend as soon as possible 
george washington had been elected the nations first president 
but could not enter office until the senate achieved a quorum and 
met to count the ballots of the electoral college 
from mount vernon he grumbled that senators and house members 
were in a state of stupor or listlessness 
but eventually the required numbers assembled 
the house counting its first quorum on april 1 april fools 
day some have noted elected frederick augustus muhlenberg of 
pennsylvania as its first speaker 
and fisher ames much mollified now that work could begin said 
he was pleased with his new colleagues 
while there were few shining geniuses he said there were 
many who had experience the virtues of the heart and habits of 
business 
on april 6 the senate counted its first quorum 
the first order of business counting the votes of the electors 
and dispatching messengers to inform washington and john adams that 
they had indeed been chosen president and vice president

the postage stamp honoring the senate will display the gilt 
shield and eagle suspended over the presiding officers chair in 
the capitols old senate chamber in use from 1810 to 1859 
the stamp honoring the house of representatives features the 
fanciful car of history a winged marble chariot which since 
1819 has borne the carved figure of clio the muse of history 
over the floor of the old house chamber now statuary hall 
rep john quincy adams who served 17 years in the house after 
his single term as president was inspired in 1840 to dedicate a 
poem to the muse who is shown recording in a book the events 
unfolding on the floor of the legislative body below 
often at odds with his colleagues and irritated by their 
conduct adams paid tribute to the muse for putting up with the 
wordy war conducted by the members 
there was wit there was wisdom he acknowledged but there was 
also the conflicting jar of ranting raving parties day and 
night 
adams concluded 
oh muse historic in thy march sublime 
still urging onward on the wheels of time 
canst thou not whisper to the chosen band 
but for one day to calm their senseless rage 
and let thy volume bear one blessed page 
of deeds devoted to their native land

the senate banking committees proposal for 
solving the savings and loan crisis waters down key sections of 
president bushs reform plan but also hands industry lobbyists 
several defeats according to a committee document 
the proposal would make a number of changes sought by sampl 
executives regarding deposit insurance regulatory structure and 
capital requirements 
however other provisions such as those restricting commercial 
real estate lending and strengthening the federal deposit insurance 
corp are less favorable to the industry than bushs feb 6 
proposal 
the document obtained monday by the associated press was 
prepared for closeddoor meetings of the senate panel starting 
today it outlines the recommendations of the staff of sen donald 
w riegle jr dmich the committee chairman 
the panel plans three private sessions this week in preparation 
for public billdrafting sessions beginning april 13 meanwhile 
democrats on the house banking committee plan a private strategy 
session wednesday before the first open meeting on thursday 
among the victories for the sampl industry in the senate proposal 
are recommendations to 
equalize deposit insurance premiums for banks and sampls by the 
year 2000 the bush proposal after a series of changes would 
charge sampls 18 cents per 100 for their insurance versus 15 cents 
per 100 for commercial banks 
give the treasury department less control over sampl regulators 
than proposed by the administration 
allow some weak sampls to grow modestly after the june 1991 
deadline for meeting tougher capital standards bush would prohibit 
sampls from expanding if their owners did not meet stricter 
requirements on how much money they must put up to back their 
institutions loans the senate proposal also would give sampls twice 
as long 20 years versus 10 years to meet tougher standards on a 
portion of capital known as goodwill 
prohibit the government from hurting regional real estate 
markets by selling repossessed property from failed sampls too 
quickly it would add real estate expertise to the new government 
board overseeing sampl bailouts by expanding the board from three 
government officials to five members including two private 
business persons 
as expected the senate proposal would count sampl rescue spending 
onbudget as opposed to the complex administration plan for 
keeping 50 billion in sampl spending out of the budget deficit 
meanwhile in a separate development commercial banks sought 
guarantees that they would get refunds of deposit insurance 
premiums once the bank insurance fund regained its full strength of 
125 in reserves for every 100 in deposits up from a depleted 80 
cents per 100 now 
the administration has said rebates could begin by the 
mid1990s but the bush bill allows regulators to decide whether or 
not to offer them and fdic chairman l william seidman wants that 
flexibility until the insurance fund reaches a level of 165 per 
100 banking groups led by the american bankers association want 
to make rebates automatic after the fund reaches the 125 level 
in at least three respects the senate proposal would hand a 
defeat to sampl lobbyists 
although the senate would allow the sampl regulatory agency the 
federal home loan bank system greater independence from the 
administration it would transfer some of the bank systems most 
important powers such as setting capital and accounting standards 
and supervising statechartered sampls to the fdic 
current law and the administration plan permits sampls to invest 
as much as 40 percent of their assets in commercial real estate 
under the senate proposal all but the healthiest sampls would have 
stricter limits 
greater limits on activities would be permitted to 
statechartered sampls but forbidden to sampls with federal charters 
other significant changes offered by the senate include 
removal of a section of the administration bill that could undo 
many of the sampl rescues put together by regulators last year 
fixed terms for the chairman and members of the fdic the 
administration wants the president to have the power to dismiss the 
fdic chairman 
removal of tougher accounting standards for credit unions a 
dispute over the administrations proposal for that industry had 
threatened to delay the sampl package

the united states is challenging the worlds 
democratic powers to move quickly and put in motion the bush 
administrations plan for easing the third worlds politically 
explosive debt burden 
treasury secretary nicholas bradys proposals to ease the 
sevenyearold debt crisis were slated for a final review today 
from the executive committee of the international monetary fund and 
the world bank 
some participants at the spring meeting of the two organizations 
have expressed concerns that unless action is taken on the brady 
plan political unrest could be unleashed in the fragile 
democracies of latin america where the huge debt burden has 
depressed living standards for most of this decade 
at least 270 people were killed in riots in venezuela in 
february after the goverment imposed a new austerity program to 
satisfy creditors 
brady in an address on monday told the organizations it was 
time to turn these concepts into specifics which provide a basis 
for lasting progress in dealing with the debt problem 
bradys scheme marks a sharp turn from past us policy because 
it seeks for the first time to reduce the 13 trillion third world 
debt by getting commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of 
their loans 
although americas allies were not in total agreement with every 
element of the plan canadian finance minister michael wilson 
predicted it would receive general approval 
he told reporters that although much discussion had gone on 
about the technical problems of putting the plan in motion there 
are no serious objections that have been put forward 
the plan got a major boost on monday when the japanese stepped 
forward with a pledge to provide up to 45 billion in new loans to 
third world debtors over the next several years the funds 
however did not match the widely anticipated 5 billion to 10 
billion expected from the tokyo government 
brady also had been counting on other countries running large 
trade surpluses such as west germany to recycle a part of their 
wealth into increased aid for developing nations 
britains chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson made clear 
there were some doubts about how completely the us plan would be 
adopted saying its proposal to use world bank and imf resources to 
guarantee interest payments raised all sorts of problems 
lawson said the time had come for the commercial banks who had 
made the loans to do more to resolve the crisis by writing off debt 
without trying to shift the burden onto the backs of the 
international lending organizations 
the imf and world bank are supported by taxpayer funds from the 
151member countries but the united states is the largest 
contributor 
what i do not find acceptable is the idea that our taxpayers 
should bail out the commercial banks lawson told reporters at a 
briefing 
the two large international lending agencies have a key role to 
play in the plan because they would be expected to put up about 12 
billion each to guarantee to the banks that the remaining part of 
the debt or the annual interest payments would be repaid 
the administration won general approval for its new approach 
from its six largest allies on sunday but the communique issued by 
the united states japan west germany britain france canada and 
italy promised only to examine the question of guaranteeing 
interest payments to the banks 
the group of sevens communique was more supportive of the less 
costly idea of guaranteeing the reduced level of debt 
mailson ferreira da nobrega finance minister of brazil the 
largest third world debtor with 110 billion owed praised the 
brady initiative calling it a major conceptual breakthrough 
with success depending on our capacity to move quickly and far 
enough 
these new ideas raise new hopes he said in his comments to 
the imf steering group they should be translated into immediate 
action it is crucial that such new hopes do not give place to new 
frustrations

former vice president spiro agnew says he 
should be able to deduct 142500 in restitution he paid maryland 
for bribes he was accused of collecting while governor a newspaper 
reported today 
the los angeles times also reported that agnew has asked a 
california tax board to refund 24197 in state income taxes 
agnew claimed the deduction on his 1982 california income tax 
return after a maryland judge ordered him to reimburse that state 
for the kickbacks prosecutors said he had accepted during his 
tenure as governor plus 101235 in interest 
the deduction was rejected four years later by a california 
franchise tax board auditor who assessed agnew additional taxes 
and interest 
the times said agnew appealed the auditors decision to the 
california state board of equalization which has scheduled a 
hearing thursday 
agnew who lives in rancho mirage argued in his tax appeal that 
he is entitled to a deduction on his california income tax because 
he paid the 142500 
the kickback scandal came to light as the watergate scandal was 
bringing down the nixon administration agnew resigned as president 
nixons vice president oct 10 1973 as part of a plea agreement 
with federal prosecutors 
he pleaded no contest to charges of income tax evasion on 
thousands of dollars prosecutors said he had taken as baltimore 
county executive from 1962 to 1966 and as maryland governor from 
1967 to 1969 the kickbacks were in exchange for government 
contracts prosecutors said 
agnew was ordered to pay 148000 to the federal government and 
14105 to maryland agnew is seeking the tax deduction in 
california because by the time the final ruling was issued in the 
maryland case in 1981 he became a california resident and had 
already made payment 
agnew also contended he was being taxed twice by maryland when 
he was directed to pay 14105 in back taxes and by california he 
also complained it is unfair to pay taxes on money he was not 
allowed to keep 
there is no doubt it is patently unfair agnews lawyer t 
rogers harrison of maryland wrote in the tax appeal 
but lawyers for the california franchise tax board said the 
question of double taxation is something agnew must resolve with 
maryland not california they said in agnews case the tax was 
paid before he became a california resident 
the state of california has never received any income in the 
form of taxes or otherwise from the amounts agnew allegedly 
received as bribes during his various terms of office lazaro l 
bobiles a lawyer for the franchise board wrote in replay to the 
appeal 
agnew has made restitution of the alleged bribes only to the 
state of maryland and has paid taxes on the alleged bribes only to 
that state and to the federal government

two gunmen burst into the home of a roman catholic 
man in the town of ballymoney today and killed him in his bed 
police said 
no group immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell 
on protestant guerrillas 
belfast police headquarters said in a statement that the attack 
occurred shortly after midnight in the town about 40 miles 
northwest of belfast police said the unidentified 29yearold 
victim was the father of four 
they said his 3monthold daughter was asleep in a crib beside 
his bed when he was shot the child was unhurt they said 
a stolen car believed to have been used by the gunmen for their 
getaway was later found burned out in another part of ballymoney 
the killing appeared to be the latest in a series of what are 
thought to be retaliatory murders by protestant and roman catholic 
extremists that began feb 12 with the slaying of a prominent 
catholic attorney 
meanwhile a news report on monday said the british broadcasting 
corp transferred two of its belfastbased journalists out of 
northern ireland after the irish republican army threatened to kill 
them 
the bbc refused to discuss the report by press association the 
domestic british news agency other than to confirm two bbc 
personnel have received death threats from the ira 
press association did not name the journalists but said one was 
the editor of news and current affairs for northern ireland and the 
other was a female reporter

three california gray 
whales cavorting in the sparkling aquamarine waters of two arm bay 
are the vanguard of migrating mammals that have arrived here every 
spring for thousands of years 
danger lurks just 30 miles to the north 
just beyond the town of seward and cape resurrection a sluggish 
river tinted iridescent by the sun flows across the surface of the 
sea it appears to be drifting inexorably toward two arm bay 
it took just 12 days for tendrils of the 101 million gallon 
crude oil spill in prince william sound to thread their way around 
reefs and rocks through straits and narrows to threaten the 
669501acre national park just 12 days for mans folly to collide 
with natures symmetry 
i keep hoping the whales are so intelligent theyll sense the 
danger and just go away said anne castellina the national 
parks superintendent 
theyve come back again right on time and i dont know how 
well protect them 
the oil released when the tanker exxon valdez ran onto a reef 
on good friday has been carried by winds and currents to within 
five miles of the park and the rich fishing grounds around seward 
right now the spill is missing us but were planning for a 
worstcase scenario said ms castellina from what i saw in 
valdez thats the only way to go 
hundreds of miles of shoreline around the port town of valdez 
terminus of the transalaska pipeline have been fouled by the 
spill and thousands of animals and birds already have died because 
of the pollution 
if we get hit theres not much to do to protect the parks 610 
miles of shoreline but we can boom off the salmon streams 
created in 1980 the new national park is a priceless necklace 
of bird rookeries tidal pools and watery whale playgrounds draped 
along the kenai peninsulas eastern coastline because most of the 
park can be reached only by floatplane or boat it attracted fewer 
than 60000 tourists last year and is more hospitable to its 
critters than its visitors 
the park chief working with a federalstate disaster team and 
officials from seward had to decide what should be saved first 
with only several thousand feet of boom available to block the oil 
from contaminating rivers streams beaches and harbors there were 
tough choices to make 
its that time of year when all the little critters come back 
to where they spend the summer said ms castellina if the oil 
comes the seals and birds arent going to know what theyre 
getting into and soon well have dead animals 
then the bears who are waking up right now from hibernation 
are going to go down to the beaches and see all this great dead 
stuff and then this glop is going to get into their stomachs and 
then will come the eagles and this mess will be in the whole chain 
and could go on for years 
ms castellina said the group had decided the rich 
salmonspawning resurrection river would be saved first 
but in places like beauty bay and surprise bay quicksand cove 
and granite passage the seals and otters and sea lions will be on 
their own because theres not enough help to go around 
sunday the national park service received permission to deploy 
a boom itself instead of having to rely on the coast guard 
three boats carrying biologists are searching the park coastline 
to inventory flora and fauna 
we want to be able to document what the impacts are because in 
the end exxon may get a bill said bud rice the parks resource 
management specialist 
were scrambling to collect preoil carcasses and pin down 
the cause of death so we can avoid the charge later of well how 
do you know those dead critters werent there already 
the grim tasks stand in stark contrast to promotional material 
the park offers 
humans have had little lasting impact on this environment a 
colorful brochure says the parks overwhelming significance is 
as a living laboratory of change

president and the cabinet had agreed not to allow even marcos body 
to be brought home if he dies 
ill keep marcos here until 1992 then ill bring him home

property the aquino government says the marcoses and their 
associates robbed the country of at least 10 billion in cash and 
other assets during the 20year rule by marcos

police and guerrillas battled again in 
northern namibia today and officials said 180 people had been 
killed in four days of fighting since the territory began its 
transition to independence 
south african military officials say the fighting is the worst 
in 23 years of bush war against the soutwest africa peoples 
organization 
police chief inspector kierie du rand said 161 guerrillas and 19 
police had been killed since saturday in a remote region near the 
angolan border he said 41 policemen and an undetermined number of 
guerrillas were wounded 
du rand said police aided by namibian soldiers were conducting 
followup operations right through ovamboland the border strip 
where the swapo guerrillas have major support 
the independent south african press association said heavy 
fighting occurred monday at oshikango a few miles from the border 
south african officials said the fighting was started by 
guerrillas who crossed the border saturday from angola violating a 
un accord that is to free namibia from south african rule 
under the agreement all guerrillas are to remain in angola at 
least 100 miles north of namibias border until midmay 
guerrilla officials and the angolan government claim the 
fighters have been in namibia for some time and fired in 
selfdefense after security forces attacked them 
villagers in northern towns most of whom support the rebels 
said they believe the guerrillas left angola to return home and did 
not expect a fight because the independence process officially has 
begun 
the villagers said the guerrillas have no newspapers or radios 
at their angolan bush camps have little contact with senior 
guerrilla commanders and probably have little understanding of the 
peace process 
south africa however accused the guerrillas of trying to 
organize armed bases inside namibia 
south african foreign minister pik botha said i have very 
little doubt that the plan was that they should infiltrate to 
establish bases quickly then they would have liked to claim that 
they have always been there 
the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp said in a 
radio editorial issued in johannesburg today that the guerrilla 
incursions bear all the signs of a planned and wellorganized 
operation 
un officials on monday permitted 1500 south african and 
namibian troops to leave their bases to help policeman fighting the 
1200 guerrillas south african col japie dreyer and other 
officers said 
in new york un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said 
the fighting does not mean the peace plan is failing 
a united nations investigation found that guerrillas had mounted 
a major incursion from angola into namibia during the weekend 
said three western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united states urged pretoria to exercise restraint 
washington also said it was holding urgent consultations with the 
soviet union cuba and angola to prevent the unraveling of the 
peace accord 
all information available to us indicates that a major 
infiltration of northern namibia by military forces of the 
southwest africa peoples organization is occurring said state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler in washington 
ms tutwiler said the guerrilla organization appears to be 
taking advantage of the vacuum created because un peacekeepers 
still are deploying to monitor the peace agreement 
only about 1000 of the planned 4650 un troops have been 
deployed we have 300 men in the northern part of the area you 
cannot say it is a failure perez de cuellar said 
swapo south africa and angola said monday they remain committed 
to the un plan which calls for nov 1 elections leading to 
independence early next year

hernan buchi the architect of chiles 
successful freemarket economy says he has resigned as finance 
minister to consider running for president 
in response to buchis departure president augusto pinochet 
asked his 15 other cabinet members monday to resign so he could 
reorganize the body 
government spokesman miguel angel poduje said buchis 
replacement and any other cabinet changes would be announced on 
wednesday no important changes were foreseen in economic policy 
buchi 40 said he resigned to study the persistent appeals of a 
group of conservative politicians and business leaders who want him 
to run for president in the dec 14 elections 
the group has plastered bumper stickers and posters supporting 
buchis candidacy throughout the capital and said last week it has 
collected 142000 signatures from citizens backing the campaign 
it never was and is not my intention to be presented for 
this type of candidacy buchi told reporters at the finance 
ministry nonetheless the situation has reached the point that 
my name is being publicly mentioned 
i reached the conclusion that analyzing this situation was 
incompatible with keeping my post as finance minister he said 
the december elections are the first since before pinochet 
seized power in a bloody 1973 coup toppling an elected leftist 
government the 73yearold army commander was obliged to call 
elections after losing a referendum in october on a proposal to 
extend his rule to 1997 
although his supporters want him to run pinochet insists he 
will not be a candidate the constitution bars him from running 
buchi who holds a masters degree in business adminstration 
from new yorks columbia university joined the pinochet 
governments economic team at age 29 and rose swiftly to become its 
chief 
after serving as an advisor and as health undersecretary he was 
named planning minister in 1983 banks superintendent a year later 
and finance minister in february 1985 
pushing exports and promoting foreign investment the 
governments economic program has produced five consecutive years 
of growth while keeping inflation to a current annual rate of about 
13 percent far lower than most latin american countries 
it has elicited praise from financial experts although 
pinochets critics contend the policies carried a high social cost 
and reduced the buying power of most workers wages 
pinochet frequently boasts of his governments economic 
successes and often praises buchi in public he has affectionately 
called him our prince valiant a reference to buchis ragged 
pageboy haircut 
a recent opinion poll showed buchi as the strongest of several 
potential conservative or rightist presidential candidates but 
lagging behind opposition leader patricio aylwin 
aylwin 70 is candidate of the centrist christian democratic 
party and is seeking the backing of a coalition of 17 centrist and 
leftist parties

a un investigation of the fierce combat 
in namibia found that nationalist guerrillas mounted a major 
incursion from angola the day the territory began its transition 
to independence diplomats say 
south africa claimed the southwest africa peoples organization 
fighters had violated the un plan under which it is ending its 
74year rule of namibia 
swapo leaders denied guerrillas involved in the fighting near 
the angolan border had crossed into namibia and criticized un 
adminstrators for agreeing to let south african troops reinforce 
police battling the guerrillas 
our people are being butchered under the united nations 
flag said swapo foreign secretary theoben gurirab accusing 
south african forces of initiating the fighting 
namibian police say at least 161 rebels and 19 police have died 
in the fighting that began saturday when a formal ceasefire was 
to have begun they said the fighting continued today 
under the unbrokered independence accord all guerrillas are 
to remain in angola at least 100 miles north of namibias border 
until midmay 
but diplomats said the swapo guerrillas apparently felt they 
were entitled under the accord to set up bases inside namibia under 
un supervision just as the south africans whom they have been 
fighting for 23 years 
whether swapo should be allowed in namibia has been a 
contentious question in the independence process 
the report on the situation by investigators led by the un 
special representative for angola martti ahtisaari of finland was 
relayed to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who briefed 
security council members on monday said three western diplomats 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the diplomats said the report presented in an atmosphere of 
unusual secrecy concluded that up to 1000 guerrillas infiltrated 
northern namibia but that their motive was unclear its details 
were not disclosed 
black african diplomats were outraged 
there can never be any question of infiltration these are 
namibians said zambian ambassador peter zuze 
south africa has accused the rebels of infiltrating in an 
attempt to set up bases an option that was rejected during 10 
years of un negotiations on terms of the namibian independence 
plan 
some un diplomats said they believed many rebels misunderstood 
the terms of the ceasefire and peace plan and thought they could 
safely march home to namibia bearing their weapons 
others accepted south africas claim that the rebel leadership 
sent the guerrillas in to establish base camps in a bid to have 
them put under un supervision just as south african troops are to 
be confined to barracks 
diplomats said ahtisaaris report did not attempt to assign 
motives for the border crossing 
gurirab insisted the guerrillas always had been in namibia and 
criticized un administrators in namibia for allowing south 
african troops to reinforce the territorial police 
the president of swapo sam nujoma on march 29 issued a 
directive to swapo combatants in namibia to make contact with un 
peacekeepers for purposes of being confined to base he said 
since armed rebels troops are obviously in namibia said 
gurirab it would make sense and it would serve everybodys 
interest if they would be confined to base and monitored by un 
observers 
gurirab criticized un officials who allowed the deployment of 
1500 south african troops to back up namibian police but did not 
name names 
its a very ugly ugly sin i think you all know that there 
has been a longstanding bloody conflict between south african 
forces and our forces and for the un to pretend that south 
africa is an impartial disinterested party in this conflict is to 
say the lest most preposterous said gurirab 
perez de cuellar said the fighting did not mean the peace plan 
is failing adding that most of the 4650 un troops planned for 
the mission are not yet on the scene only about 1000 un troops 
have been deployed 
we have 300 men in the northern part of the area you cannot 
say it is a failure perez de cuellar said 
swapo south africa and angola said monday that they remain 
committed to the un plan which calls for nov 1 elections 
leading to independence early next year 
besides independence for namibia the plan calls for the 
withdrawal of cuban troops who have been helping the marxist 
government in angola fight south africabacked rebels

contra rebels have agreed to 
observe a ceasefire until february when elections are scheduled 
in nicaragua but pledge to keep their forces combatready to 
pressure the sandinista government 
a source in the rebel directorate speaking on condition of 
anonymity said commander enrique bermudez told the rebels about 
the decision during visits friday to contra camps just across the 
border from nicaragua 
bermudez is the contras chief military leader 
radio liberacion the contras radio station also broadcast a 
message monday from bermudez that said the rebels will not 
launch any attack against the sandinistas until february 1990 we 
will not look for combat but will permanently be on the defensive 
the rebel army will be preserved intact on the defense and 
watching for the sandinistas to fulfill their promise of greater 
democracy for nicaragua 
the leftist sandinista government has declared monthly 
unilateral ceasefires since the expiration of a temporary truce 
the two sides signed in march 1988 the truce was to lay the 
groundwork for a permanent peace but talks collapsed last september 
there was no immediate sandinista reaction to the rebel 
announcement 
in february five central american presidents agreed to come up 
with a plan by midmay to disband the contras nicaragua in turn 
agreed to general elections in february and to other steps toward 
democratic reforms 
that accord took us officials by surprise they reacted with a 
bipartisan proposal now before congress to provide about 45 
million in nonlethal aid to the rebels through february 
fighting in the 7yearold war has diminished to sporadic 
skirmishes since us military aid to the contras ended in february 
1988 an estimated 11000 rebels and members of their families live 
in the honduran camps 
the message broadcast by radio liberacion quoted bermudez as 
saying the weapons of the freedom fighters constitute the only 
guarantee that the nicaraguan people have to pressure the 
sandinistas into fulfilling their promise of introducing democracy 
to nicaragua 
for that reason our troops will remain intact and alert but 
will not participate in actions of destruction or attacks against 
sandinista military positions 
we reaffirm our desire to achieve democracy and freedom for 
our country through peaceful means but we reaffirm also our 
decision to achieve these desires through weapons if the peaceful 
means fail 
bermudez reportedly left for miami on friday 
the rebel source also said juan ramon vivas romero known as 
commander quiche had temporarily stepped down as head of the 
contras chiefs of staff because of pain from an old combat wound 
the source said israel galeano known as commander franklin 
replaced vivas romero

an immigration judge has ordered the deportation 
of a reputed organized crime boss linked to a dozen killings and 
known as the al capone of italy 
carmine esposito received the order monday but it could take 
moths before his is deported to his native italy said craig 
oswald assistant counsel for the immigration and naturalization 
service 
oswald said judge craig m zerbe weighed the positive factors in 
espositos case his wife and one of his children are us 
citizens against negative factors that included espositos 
alleged membership in an italian criminal clan similar to the mafia 
and his entry into the united states on a false passport 
the negative factors weigh overwhelmingly against an exercise 
of judgment on espositos behalf the judge decided 
philip parenti espositos attorney said he planned to 
challenge the ruling before the board of immigration appeals 
were appealing the fact that they cant use foreign 
convictions to deport somebody parenti said 
basically theyre trying to accomplish through the back door 
what they couldnt do through extradition 
authorities originally tried to deport esposito on an italian 
extradition memo but the italian charges were dropped after 
esposito was not brought to trial within 18 months of his arrest as 
required by law in italy 
italian authorities charged that esposito ordered or committed 
12 killings in italy from april 1982 through june 1983 while 
holding a top post in the nuova camorra organizzata a criminal 
clan that operates in and around naples near espositos home town 
of acerra 
when those charges were dropped us authorities shifted the 
case to immigration courts moving to deport esposito on grounds 
that he entered the united states illegally 
esposito 31 was arrested in march 1988 at his north side 
restaurant he also had worked as an autobody repairman car 
salesman and sausagemaker

several racist incidents on campus in recent years 
faculty instead agreed monday to ask the curriculum committee of 
the college of literature science and the arts to consider by next 
fall ways to offer racism studies 
incidents at the university have included the distribution of a 
flyer declaring open season on blacks in 1987 racist jokes by 
a disc jockey on the student radio station and the stuffing of ku

he was optimistic despite the vote 
the debate was a substantive and good one i think the

syrian and christian gunners attacked 
residential areas in and around beirut with howitzers and rockets 
and police said at least six people were killed and 18 wounded 
during a night of fighting 
the bombardment that began late saturday subsided into sporadic 
exchanges at daybreak today 
the overnight casualties raised the toll to 153 people killed 
and 499 wounded since march 8 when the latest round of hostilities 
broke out between gen michel aouns christian troops and an 
alliance of syrian and druse forces 
meanwhile lebanons electricity authority said in a statement 
that its power station in the christian suburb of zouk would run 
out of fuel oil today and it would stop providing power to most of 
lebanon 
the statement said a freighter loaded with 30 tons of fuel oil 
has not been able to unload its cargo at the power stations dock 
because of the shelling 
insurance companies want a solid ceasefire before accepting 
to cover any ship that wants to dock at the zouk station the 
statement said 
the independent daily annahar and other publications today 
carried frontpage statements from the us state department and 
the european community calling for a ceasefire in lebanon 
despite the relative lull today civilians remained huddled in 
basements and bomb shelters 
a dozen families in the basement of an apartment building in the 
christian district of adonis dispatched one man to a bakery for 
bread 
this is the safest way we will send one of us to buy food for 
the whole building every day until a ceasefire is declared and 
accepted by both sides antoine shedyak said 
yes there is a lull but there is no ceasefire we will not 
take any unnecessary risks shedyak a mechanical engineer said 
in a telephone interview 
kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah ahmad sabah was due in the 
syrian capital of damascus today to try end the present 
confrontation 
sabah heads a sixman arab league committee assigned to find a 
settlement to a political crisis that threatens to cement lebanons 
partition into sectarian ministates 
the leftist daily paper assafir which is close to syria said 
sabah would propose a twomonth truce in the conflict to give the 
arab league committee enough time to solve the crisis 
aoun backed by 20000 troops has insisted that syria be party 
to any ceasefire accord the current fighting broke out when aoun 
blockaded illegal militia ports that diverted 100 million from 
governmentrun ports 
the syrians have 40000 troops in predominantly moslem areas of 
lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate their received from the arab 
league in 1976 two years after civil war broke out in lebanon 
officially the syrians maintain that their troops in lebanon 
are not involved in the confrontation with aouns forces which are 
entrenched across a 310squaremile christian enclave northeast of 
beirut 
nabih berri the shiite moslem chief of the amal militia said 
monday in damascus that 20 representatives of moslem and leftist 
groups would meet sabah in damascus on wednesday 
press reports said the group would outline its desire for a new 
political system that distributes powers equally among the various 
lebanese sects the election of a new president and formal links 
with syria 
the christians are to dispatch a 10man delegation for a meeting 
with sabah later in the week 
lebanon has been without a head of state since sept 22 when 
the sixyearterm of president amin gemayel expired with parliament 
failing to elect a successor 
gemayel appointed aoun a fellow maronite head of an interim 
military cabinet to rule pending the election of a new president 
syrianbacked moslems rejected aouns appointment because it 
violated a 45yearold tradition of having a sunni moslem prime 
minister

wedding bells are ok but those who get 
married in the oklahoma county courthouse can no longer celebrate 
with rice or birdseed 
oklahoma county commissioners on monday voted to ban the 
throwing of rice bird seed confetti and other similar substances 
in and around the courthouse 
rice and bird seed traditionally have been tossed at weddings as 
symbols of fertility but the commissioners action apparently was 
not an effort to limit population growth 
commissioner fg buck buchanan said the policy was enacted 
as a safety measure 
weve had people who have been hurt by sliding on rice and so

after talks with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev a cheerful president fidel castro seemed pleased but was 
noncommittal about their discussions on issues that often have 
left them deeply divided 
familylike was how castro described the talks after 
bidding gorbachev good night monday on the steps of the 
presidential palace 
when reporters pressed him for details castro had ready a 
twoword linguistic hybrid glasnost manana 
that was castros way of saying more on the discussions will be 
known when gorbachev addresses the national assembly late this 
afternoon the last major scheduled event during his 63hour stay 
in cuba 
the official soviet news agency tass reported today that 
gorbachev said improving the international climate is central to 
his discussions with castro 
it is generally felt that there is mounting aspiration in the 
world for better relations and i think that the soviet union and 
cuba understand their responsibility gorbachev said 
the report made no mention of differences between the two 
leaders 
moments before castro said good night monday gorbachev 
descended the steps of the ornate prerevolutionary palace with his 
wife raisa at his side they received applause from the diplomats 
and officials who had joined them for a glittering reception 
aside from visits to two monuments and an exhibit highlighting 
the achievements of the revolution gorbachev spent monday with 
castro in talks 
speculation swirled all day about a possible gorbachev 
announcement forgiving cuba its debt to the soviet union estimated 
at between 8 billion and 20 billion but castro said that issue 
never came up 
debt he said is not a problem for cuba but for other latin 
american countries his answer did not appear to rule out a 
gorbachev announcement that he will give cuba a break on debt 
repayments 
combined with the estimated 6 billion cuba owes western 
countries the island is one of the most heavily indebted countries 
in the world in per capital terms 
diplomats in havana and in moscow speaking on condition of 
anonymity have said the soviets already appear to have reduced the 
subsidies they pay by buying cuban sugar at 
higherthanworldmarket prices and some said they expected 
gorbachev to tell castro bluntly but in private that cuba must 
put its economic house in order 
ricardo alarcon cuban vice foreign minister said today that a 
difference in views on economic policy doesnt necessarily mean 
that you should have a confrontation or difference of other sort 
in an interview with abcs good morning america alarcon 
also characterized mondays talks as warm and friendly 
gennady i gerasimov gorbachevs spokesman said the morning 
portion of the talks stressed latin american debt and drug 
trafficking 
a soviet official said monday evening that gorbachev might have 
an announcement this afternoon relating to a latin american issue 
but refused to be more specific 
gorbachev told the united nations in december the soviet union 
was prepared to offer the leastdeveloped countries a moratorium on 
debt service and in quite a few cases to write off the debt 
altogether 
castro has campaigned for years for cancellation of latin 
americas 420 billion foreign debt declaring it is unpayable and 
has contributed to economic decline throughout the hemisphere 
the cuban revolutionary leader seemed ebullient after mondays 
marathon talks leaving no hint that any of the widely publicized 
ideological problems with gorbachev were impairing their 
relationship 
a soviet official insisting on anonymity said western reports 
had been making too much of sovietcuban differences 
he said the soviet goal is to deemphasize ideology but castro 
himself has been a stalwart supporter of maintaining communist 
orthodoxy criticizing gorbachev for straying far afield with his 
campaign for greater openness and a restructuring of the soviet 
economy 
gerasimov said gorbachev explained to castro the details of last 
weeks nationwide parliamentary elections one of the most dramatic 
symbols of the soviet leaders reform program because they were the 
countrys first contested elections in seven decades 
gorbachev was to speak to the assembly today after visits to 
local health and construction projects and a final meeting with 
castro in early afternoon 
he is to leave for london on wednesday morning

for the couple standing vigil beside a 
collapsed highway bridge the waiting was harder than knowing if 
their loved one was killed along with seven others when the 
55yearold span gave way 
they brought up a piece of car that was the same color as 
his paul hurst said monday as searchers continued looking for 
victims in the rainswollen hatchie river 
seven bodies have been pulled from river since the bridge 
collapsed saturday night but authorities continued their search 
today operating under the belief at least one more car is still 
submerged 
hurst said his halfbrother adrain jones 26 has not been seen 
since shortly before a 90foot section of the us 51 bridge fell 
sending cars and a tractor trailer rig plunging 25 feet into the 
water 
he left the hospital and i went to memphis the same time 
said hurst who with his wife brenda has been waiting beside the 
river since they first heard of the bridge collapse a few hours 
after the accident 
he didnt make it he was going back to ripley because his 
daddy was sick and he was going to stay with him 
authorities said they too are working on the assumption that 
jones car is somewhere in the dark swirling water 
monday a dog trained to sniff bodies appeared to find 
something authorities resumed dragging operations this morning 
divers were forced to wait because of strong currents in the river 
about 50 miles north of memphis 
also monday workers began cutting up the three 28foot bridge 
spans when the 100ton concrete slabs are jackhammered into 
manageable pieces a crane will be brought in to remove them said 
jim thacker regional manager of the tennessee emergency management 
agency 
terry petty a diver with the tennessee highway patrol said 
searchers were unsure what they will find under the slabs two of 
which are known to be lying on at least three cars and a tractor 
trailer truck 
anythings possible he said 
also petty said it is unclear if any vehicles went into the 
river but were not trapped by the falling slabs 
i dont know with this current if a car went off after it 
fell it could be a mile down the river he said 
the cause of the collapse was unknown but state transportation 
commissioner jimmy evans said heavy spring floods following two 
years of drought may have undercut a bridge support two 
inspections during the last 18 months revealed no problems he said 
the collapse apparently began when a support holding up one of 
the bridge sections gave way said jacky carter a state inspector 
as the cars and the 18wheeler plunged of the bridge the other 
two highway sections came crashing down on them he said 
residents say they have worried about the safety of the bridge 
for some time but lauderdale county executive bill tucker said his 
office has not received any such complaints 
ive crossed that bridge many times every week and ive never 
had any fear of it he said obviously theyre going to 
complain now 
the bridge eighttenths of a mile long carries two northbound 
lanes of us 51 across the hatchie about five miles north of 
covington 
a companion bridge built in the mid1970s to carry the 
southbound lanes was unaffected but has been closed indefinitely 
while state and federal officials investigate 
joseph osterman an investigator with the national 
transportation safety board said it would take his agency several 
months to file a report

hiring parkin to help teledyne get the contract rosen said 
parkin told the teledyne officials he knew his way around the 
navy that he could do a job for us 
rosen said that parkin wanted a written agreement which he 
described as ink on paper to formalize his consulting relationship 
with teledyne in return he would take measures to assure the 
contract would be awarded to teledyne electronics 
the agreement called for parkin to receive 10000 in advance 
for expenses and 150000 as a reward once teledyne obtained the 
contract 
rosen said he later expressed misgivings to sullivan about the 
agreement with parkin recalling a conversation on a golf course 
rosen said he told sullivan i think we were being foolish i 
thought we were being ripped off 
asked how sullivan replied rosen said he said i was just as 
involved as everybody else 
at mondays opening day of the trial the first witness was 
charles jones an air force contracting officer 
on the witness stand jones discussed the 25month process that 
led to the pentagons decision in july 1987 to sign with teledyne 
electronics a contract to make handheld radar test equipment 
dehenzel argued the three defendants were part of a conspiracy 
that included bribing berlin to receive inside information crucial 
to winning the contract 
he said berlin provided information about another competitor 
that should have been kept secret 
a lot of information should not have been given to anyone 
outside government he said 
berlin also spoke during internal pentagon discussions in favor 
of a position that benefited teledyne he said specifically the 
former navy official opposed limiting the contract to small 
businesses a decision that would have excluded teledyne from 
bidding that decision was ultimately reversed 
teledyne industries parkin lackner and berlin were all named 
in the indictment returned by a grand jury in january they pleaded 
guilty and are cooperating with the government savaides also 
pleaded guilty but he was not indicted 
the defendants lawyers said their clients never knew about a 
secret deal that parkin made with his associates kaub sullivan 
and schnittjer believed parkin used legitimate methods to obtain 
information about contracts a timehonored practice they said 
the conspiracy in this case was directed as much as concealing 
from teledyne as defrauding the government said george 
oconnell sullivans lawyer 
mark tuohey kaubs attorney described the deal between parkin 
and his associates as a conspiracy of silence 
kaub was teledyne electronics executive vice president dealing 
with government contracts sullivan and his successor schnittjer 
were also executive vice presidents 
as part of the evidence prosecutors have said they will play 
tapes from conversations between parkin and his associates the 
government taped the telephone calls as part of their investigation 
the coasttocoast investigation into the pentagons 
150billionayear purchasing system began nearly three years but 
it was not publicly revealed until june 1988

egyptian president hosni mubarak defended the 
scope and pace of his nations economic reforms today and told 
members of congress that egypt needs continued high levels of us 
economic assistance 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine described the 
90minute private meeting between mubarak and 15 senators as very 
beneficial and fruitful but said commitments on the aid issue 
were neither sought nor given 
both mitchell and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
said senators told the egyptian president that the united states 
must keep the large us budget deficit in mind in dealing with all 
requests for economic and military assistance 
mitchell said senators appeared favorably impressed with 
mubaraks description of egypts economic reform program including 
the reduction of subsidies on a number of consumer products and 
revisions in the countrys tax structure 
mitchell was asked if senators were satisfied at the pace of the 
mubarak program 
obviously every national leader confronts the same general 
problem of the pace of economic reform he replied we confront 
a similar problem in dealing with our budget deficit 
the president argued that the pace he is pursuing is the one 
most appropriate to their circumstances and the one most likely to 
bring success mitchell said 
on another subject dole said mubarak flatly denied reports that 
egypt intends to acquire chemical weapons and said he was quite 
angry about being lumped in with such nations as libya which is 
widely believed to be ready to produce such weapons 
mubarak met on monday with president bush who said he has set as 
us goals in the middle east an end to israels occupation of the 
west bank and gaza and fulfillment of political rights for the 12 
million palestinian arabs who live in the territories 
bush also reaffirmed a us commitment to israels security and 
said all the goals were shared by egypt 
the statement appears to put pressure on israel in advance of 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs talks here wednesday and thursday 
but mubarak answering questions from the floor at a dinner 
monday night said he was not asking the bush administration to 
pressure israel exerting pressure wont solve anything 
mubarak said 
mubarak in the second day of his visit also met today 
secretary of state james a baker iii and treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady 
the egyptian leader is hoping congress will approve new weapons 
sales once they are formally proposed by the bush administration 
and that 230 million in us economic aid will be released the 
aid was withheld in march pending reforms in the way egypt manages 
its economy which that country must have in place by june 
bush did not spell out the political rights he seeks for the 
palestinians who live on the west bank and in gaza nor did he 
amplify his call for an end to israeli occupation of the 
territories lost by the arabs in the middle east war of 1967 
the president put his position this way egypt and the united 
states share the goals of security for israel the end of the 
occupation and achievement of palestinian political rights 
bush went on to say that a properly structured international 
conference could play a useful role at an appropriate time in 
reaching those goals through negotiations 
in nicosia cyprus plo chairman yasser arafats chief adviser 
welcomed bushs statement as an important and serious 
development 
bassam abu sharif told the associated press the palestine 
liberation organization feels this will give a real push for 
peace efforts in the middle east 
but in jerusalem shamir indicated that during his us visit he 
will state his opposition to an end to israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip and bushs endorsement of an international 
peace conference 
mubarak has been pushing for a mideast conference for years a 
us official said the egyptian leader had the end of the year or 
early 1990 in mind 
we believe there is a lot of ground that has to be covered 
before there could be a conference the official told reporters 
at the white house he answered their questions under rules that 
shielded his identity 
all us administrations since 1967 have said israel should 
yield land on the west bank and gaza in exchange for peace but 
none has specified whether the united states would urge its ally to 
yield all the territory 
the resolutions approved by the un security council in 1967 
and in 1973 after the yom kippur war were intentionally vague on 
this point 
bush did not specify whether his administration was demanding 
total israeli withdrawal 
another us official who also demanded anonymity said there 
was nothing new in bushs statement and i didnt see anything 
new 
shamir who arrives wednesday in washington will propose 
holding elections among the palestinians in the territories to find 
leaders who would negotiate their future with israel 
but mubarak told bush that elections held under israeli 
supervision were unacceptable to the palestinians the us 
official who briefed reporters said 
evidently bush did not reject the idea out of hand the official 
said the president had raised questions about various forms of 
supervision 
a revolt by arabs on the west bank and in gaza that began in 
december 1987 has led to the death of 419 arabs and 18 israelis 
shamir holds the palestine liberation organization partly 
responsible for the uprising 
mubarak told bush he doubted plo chairman yasser arafat could 
control the violence the official said

the owner of a winery has been ordered 
to pay 100 a week in fines because he did not plant enough grape 
vines on his property 
the town of southampton says alan barr who owns le reve winery 
was required to plant vines by april 1 on all 55 acres he owns in 
water mill and southampton he now has vines planted on 33 acres 
town attorney john bennett said the town wants to keep barr from 
erecting a large wine factory on the land which is in the middle 
of a residential area 
the money to pay the fine will be taken from a 5000 bond barr 
posted in 1986 when the town planning board approved his plan to 
build the winery bennett said 
barr said he wanted to plant all 55 acres but an upstate nursery 
refused to deliver vines without being paid 30000 in advance 
other nurseries were short on grapevines and it might be another 
year before he can plant more vines on his land he said

a former colleague of oliver north testified 
today that responses north was preparing for house members on 
contra assistance did not appear to be accurate 
vincent michael cannistraro recounted for the jury in norths 
us district court trial a conversation in september 1985 in which 
north shared some of the responses he was preparing for house 
members asking about reports he was assisting the nicaraguan rebels 
he showed you some of his answers asked prosecutor john 
keker 
i asked him if they were accurate and they did not appear to 
be so responded cannistraro who at the time worked with north 
at the national securiy council 
recalling cannistraros previously secret testimony before a 
federal grand jury keker asked did you do anything in the 
conversation with north after seeing the responses 
when cannistraro balked at answering keker the prosecutor put 
his hand up to his nose and then stretched out his arm in a gesture 
reminiscent of the tale of pinocchio a puppet whose nose grew 
longer when he lied 
not that long responded cannistraro as the courtroom 
erupted in laughter 
north is accused of lying to congress in 1985 by allegedly 
preparing letters signed by thennational security adviser robert 
mcfarlane denying the national security council staff was assisting 
the contras 
the denials came amid a twoyear congressional ban on military 
aid to the rebel force 
cannistraro recalled a comment by a cia official that 
whatever ollie was doing he was bound to get us all in a lot of 
trouble and he wanted to stay far away from him 
was colonel north considered a trustworthy person by his 
colleagues at the nsc asked keker 
i had considered colonel north a trustworthy person but there 
were occasions when there were questions about some of the 
things he told us cannistraro said after pausing 
keker then read portions of cannistraros grand jury testimony 
in 1987 in which he said that with colonel north you never could 
be certain if what he was telling us was true or fantasy or 
deliberately meant to mislead 
my practice was to take everything with four grains of salt 
cannistraro testified to the grand jury in 1987 
keker also revealed that cannistraro made no mention in his 1987 
grand jury appearance of his assertion monday that cia director 
william casey said president reagan had designated north as the man 
who would assist the contras 
cannistraro defended the omission by saying he wasnt asked 
about it but keker read questions from the prosecutor at the time 
in which cannistraro was asked for all details pertaining to 
meetings concerning the contras 
cannistraro stuck to his story that no prosecutor had asked him 
about the meeting despite kekers suggestion that cannistraro was 
either inventing the testimony about reagan or had covered up in 
1987 
mr casey said he had discussed this with the president of 
the united states and this was how it should be handled 
cannistraro testified 
cannistraro one of the first witnesses called by north is the 
first to state outright that reagan had chosen north to work for 
the contras 
cannistraro was also one of the first witnesses called by north 
as the former white house aide began his defense monday on charges 
of lying to congress and white house officials about his role in 
assisting the nicaraguan rebels 
at the meeting in caseys office the cia director said north as 
an nsc staffer wouldnt be subject to a congressional prohibition 
on aiding the contras cannistraro testified casey said north was 
to become the principal point of reference according to 
cannistraro 
congress banned us intelligence agencies from assisting the 
contras as of october 1984 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane has testified 
he was the one who directed north and an nsc colleague to do 
everything they could to keep the contras functioning and their 
morale up 
reagan told the tower commission which investigated the 
irancontra affair on jan 26 1987 that he did not know that 
the nsc staff was engaged in helping the contras

portauprince haiti ap the government said today it freed 
three military commanders who led a failed coup attempt mutinous 
soldiers surrendered control of the airport and returned to their 
barracks 
state television announced lt col himmler rebu commander of 
the leopards battalion col phillipe biamby commander of the 
presidential guard and col leonce qualo an administrative 
officer at army headquarters were given safe passage to the united 
states 
a government communique identified rebu biamby and qualo as 
leaders of what it called a foolhardy attempt sunday to 
overthrow the government of lt gen prosper avril 
the president magnanimously decided to release the officers 
and they were escorted to the border of the dominican republic on 
monday night to get a flight to an undisclosed city in the united 
states the communique said rebu was accompanied by his wife and 
four children 
the government did not explain why the three men were freed but 
the move was clearly meant to defuse resistance within the leopards 
battalion at least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were 
killed monday in skirmishes with troops loyal to avril the rebels 
were demanding rebus release 
independent radio haitiinter said rebel units of the leopards 
battalion withdrew monday night from the portauprince airport 
but the airport remained closed schools also were closed for a 
second day 
avril assumed power six months ago in a coup led by 
noncommissioned officers who said they were disgusted by official 
corruption and human rights abuses 
on monday night presidential guardsmen in tanks battled 
leopards commandos on a main throughfare between the airport and 
downtown portauprince 
radio stations gave conflicting casualty reports saying four to 
eight leopards were killed and several wounded 
nine members of an independent council appointed to organize and 
schedule presidential elections were to be sworn in today but the 
ceremony was postponed until thursday because of the violence 
officials said 
avril said in february he was forming the council an 
announcement many haitians welcomed as a sign of democratic times 
to come 
the leader of this impoverished caribbean nation has promised 
elections and pointed as proof he is keeping his pledge to the 
council which is to include representatives of the roman catholic 
church labor unions the military human rights groups the media 
and judiciary 
rebel soldiers made three demands over radio haitiinter on 
monday they said they wanted rebu released a civilian government 
installed and total restoration of a 1987 constitution restricting 
the armys role in government those parts of the constitution were 
suspended in june 
radio haitiinter cited sources close to the police command as 
reporting that avril had determined a handful of soldiers and 
officers were involved in sundays coup attempt 
avril said on nationwide television early monday that the coup 
was led by some members of the armed forces blinded by their 
exhorbitant ambitions but gave no details 
avril was seized early sunday by rebel troops but rescued by 
loyal forces later in the day no casualties were reported sunday 
there was speculation the coup attempt may have been linked to 
avrils crackdown on drug trafficking by the military last week 
four highranking army officers were accused of drug dealing and 
arrested 
the troops that installed avril as president ousted lt gen 
henri namphy on sept 17 1988 namphy had led the country for most 
of the time since a february 1986 popular uprising forced dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier into exile ending 30 years of duvalier family 
rule 
us officials have conditioned the restoration of 70 million 
in suspended economic aid on haiti moving toward democracy 
respecting human rights and cracking down on the drug trade the 
funds were suspended after thugs massacred 34 voters in november 
1987 aborting haitis first elections in 30 years

exxon finished pumping 42 million gallons 
of crude oil from the crippled exxon valdez today and planned to 
refloat the tanker 12 days after the wreck that caused the nations 
worst oil spill 
exxon shipping co plans to refloat the tanker wednesday and 
take it to portland ore for repairs but port officials there 
said they were uncertain about accepting it even though the 12 
million repair bill would provide about 200 jobs 
were not willing to trade in the environment for jobs port 
spokesman darrel buttice said monday 
the 11 million barrels of oil remaining after the accident have 
been pumped from eight ruptured tanks into three ships over the 
past week exxon shipping president frank iarossi said boats and 
booms will tag along as the tanker is refloated to prevent any 
spread of residual oil 
exxon valdez capt joseph hazelwood who was fired and charged 
with being drunk at the time of the disastrous accident made plans 
to surrender today near his hometown of huntington ny said new 
york state trooper craig rubio 
hazelwood 42 is accused of misdemeanor charges of operating 
the ship while under the influence of alcohol reckless 
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil 
on monday the spill forced officials to close the 12 million 
herring fishery for the season 
the fishery is where fishermen go after herring just as the fish 
are about to spawn at the start of the prince william sound fishing 
season more than half the herrings spawning habitat was polluted 
it means they dont have a fishery and it means they have to 
come up with another means of making a living said jack lamb 
president of the cordova district fishermen united the fishermen 
will be eligible for compensation from exxon 
other fishermen meanwhile worried that the spreading slick 
will shut down even more lucrative salmon fishing this summer the 
regions fishing industry is worth 150 million a year 
the ship has leaked oil since the good friday accident when the 
vessel crashed into bligh reef and spilled more than 10 million 
gallons of oil 
fishermen have formed the backbone of the cleanup using their 
boats to pull containment booms across bays near salmon streams and 
sensitive fish hatcheries 
at sawmill bay the hardesthit hatchery in the sound and home 
to 2 million salmon currents pushed oil against the booms a light 
sheen made its way past barriers 
the hatchery holds more than 2 million salmon fry which can be 
poisoned by small amounts of oil hatchery manager eric prestegard 
said they may have to airlift the fish fry to clean water a double 
whammy to fishermen who fund the hatcheries through surcharges on 
their catch 
more than 1000 seabirds and at least 30 sea otters caught in 
the oil have died some were found covered with asphalthard oil 
officials said the death toll is probably much higher but they 
have had time to survey only a small portion of the sounds 2500 
miles of coastline 
every day its getting a little worse otter rescue 
specialist chris donohoe said as he squatted by a dead duck you 
clean a beach up the tide changes and the oil comes right back 
department of fish and game spokesman jon lyman said a deer 
found dead on naked island about 25 miles southwest of bligh reef 
apparently had eaten contaminated food an indication of how 
rapidly the spill was spreading 
thats bad news thats the top of the food chain lyman 
said 
on nearby green island hundreds of birds lay along the beach 
as black and lifeless as the oilsmeared rocks around them 
in other developments 
flow through the pipeline was increased but remained below 
normal levels the accident forced restrictions on tankers in 
valdez harbor the only port for the transalaska pipeline which 
carries nearly onequarter of the united states domestic supply of 
crude oil 
in an interview in new york exxon president lee r raymond 
said he hopes the emotional type of atmosphere generated by the 
spill does not prompt congress to reject the oil industrys request 
to drill in protected wildlife areas 
thats exactly what could happen us interior secretary manuel 
lujan suggested in washington 
if the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails 
among the us public then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil 
and gas development in the arctic national wildlife refuge 
offshore and in the public lands lujan said 
rep george miller dcalif chairman of the house 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the pipeline planned to fly to 
alaska to examine the damage from the spill which has grown larger 
than rhode island 
the oil spill has raised many serious questions about the 
ability of the industry to safely operate in a fragile 
environmental area said miller whose house interior 
subcommittee will consider legislation that would allow exploration 
for more oil on alaskas north slope 
us sen frank murkowski a champion of oil exploration in 
alaska asked that plans for drilling in bristol bay the states 
richest fishing grounds be set aside until the industry can 
demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills 
the exxon valdez accident has taught us that simply having a 
plan is not sufficient the alaska republican said 
oil is so thick that walking on once pristine beaches is 
treacherous and workers wear hardhats to protect against injuries 
from frequent tumbles on rocks beaches smell like gas station 
garages

prison sentence is suing his victims alleging he is unable to find 
a new job and has suffered humiliation anxiety and loss of health 
john taylor booz 62 filed a 2 million damage lawsuit march 28 
in state district court 
defendants include two youths he was convicted of molesting 
other defendants include a boy whose allegations were rejected by a 
jury and members of at least two of the boys families 
booz alleged that he lost his job as a salesman and cannot find 
a new job in his field because of a conspiracy and accusations by 
the people he sued 
he alleged he has lost earnings and earning capacity into the 
indeterminate future and has suffered extreme humiliation 
anxiety and loss of health 
district attorney robert schwartz said he would defend the 
families 
he said he will not allow a convicted child molester to

legal assault comes to as final a conclusion as the sexual 
assault 
schwartz said he determined that neither the new mexico crime 
victims reparation commission nor the risk management division can 
cover legal expenses for the families so he will provide the 
defense

sexual contact of a minor and one count of child enticement his 
conviction was upheld on appeal 
the boys were about 10 to 11 years old at the time chief deputy

frigid weather chilled france on tuesday bringing 
paris its first snowfall since the winter of 198788 
the blustering cold followed days of balmy weather crowned by 
spring blossoms that started sprouting a week ago as temperatures 
soared to the 70s 
tuesdays early morning temperatures hovered around freezing in 
the northern half of the country with gusts of wind reaching 30 mph 
the snow coated trees and lawns but did not disrupt morning 
traffic because it melted as soon as it hit the streets 
the paris weather bureau said the impression that a cold wave 
had struck stemmed from the contrast between the freezing 
temperatures and the warm weather last week forecasters said snow 
and cold temperatures are normal for early april in the northern 
part of the country 
in the south in provence and along the french riviera where 
there was concern about the lack of moisture onehalf to nearly 2 
inches of rain fell in the past 24 hours rain also fell in the 
pyrenees along the spanish border 
in the english channel winds gusted up to 50 mph and waves of 
20 feet were reported off the channel islands

enjoying warm weather temperatures dropped to 36 degrees and the

travelers using lambert airport faced long 
delays and cancellations early this week because of fog 
thunderstorms and a radar malfunction but the weather cleared and 
operations were normal today 
lambert can land from 60 to 84 planes an hour but because of 
poor weather and the radar problem that figure was reduced to 36 
on sunday and monday traffic manager sam smith said 
smith said the weekend weather forecast was favorable when the 
decision was made last week to replace a radar antenna the switch 
was made saturday but a glitch blitzed the system sunday 
morning the local radar went down and lambert had to rely on an 
auxiliary system piped in from kansas city 
bad weather forced the federal aviation administration to put a 
ground hold on lambert meaning planes in other airports were 
not allowed to take off if their destination was lambert

a barge loaded with 160000 gallons of 
lye ran aground and capsized in the ohio river but officials said 
there was no immediate threat to wildlife or water supplies 
the barge was one of 15 being transported by a tugboat around a 
sharp bend when it broke away and ran aground near the rocky shore 
said lt commander arthur adkins of the us coast guard at 
huntington 
the accident occurred about 20 miles southwest of parkersburg at 
long bottom ohio and murraysville wva near where a barge also 
carrying lye ran aground two years ago 
a salvage expert from ppg industries inc the barges owner 
was expected to arrive at the scene today adkins said cleanup and 
removal of the barge was expected to take weeks 
no leaks were detected adkins said but small amounts of the 
lye solution known as sodium hydroxide or caustic soda may be 
seeping through vents in the barge 
coast guard lt kevin maehler said this morning that preliminary 
water tests showed little of the lye had escaped the barge 
lye is considered hazardous because it is highly alkaline in 
high concentrations such as the amount the barge was carrying lye 
will burn skin and eyes and can be dangerous if swallowed adkins 
said 
drinking water could be infected so water intake users 
downstream have been notified adkins said 
because of the swift current it would take a major leak to 
endanger aquatic life or drinking water said ron sandy the west 
virginia department of natural resources field staff supervisor 
if there was any significant leakage we would have seen some 
dead aquatic life sandy said there didnt seem to be any 
the accident didnt tie up river traffic officials said 
workers kept the upturned hull of the barge illuminated throughout 
monday night maehler said 
strong currents were blamed for the april 9 1987 grounding of 
a ppg barge with 200000 gallons of lye no leaks were reported 
from that incident

the fight to save oilfouled prince 
william sounds 100 million salmon run from ruin comes down to a 
fish hatchery tucked away in this pretty little bay 
if we lose san juan hatchery we lose it all said jack 
lamb the acting president of cordova district fishermen united 
san juan is owned by the prince william sound aquaculture corp 
san juan because it is close to the oilfree waters of the 
ocean has the best chance of any to survive and produce the pink 
salmon needed to replenish the oilkilled stocks lamb said monday 
thats why 25 fishing boats and sleepless crews from the fishing 
town of cordova are struggling to hold back the huge river of crude 
oil coursing past the bay 
the fishermen increasingly equipped with booms oil vacuums 
and supply vessels from the state and exxon have laid four miles 
of boom across the bay since they started a week ago 
still currents pushed oil against the booms monday and a light 
sheen made its way past outer barriers 
al rule is among the fishermen who move along the booms in 
skiffs keeping them lined up against the oil 
this hatchery is our meat and potatoes said rule so i 
know we got to save it 
but i still think about what id be doing if there wasnt an 
oil spill and i wasnt doing this id be fishin right now id be 
herring fishing if it wasnt shut thats my spring money my 
startup money there and thats what id like to be doing 
the fierce determination of people like rule is the reason san 
juan will survive the oil tide predicted al kegler the state 
department of environmental conservation official helping the 
efforts 
well make the booms hold and well beat the oil 
the hatchery nestled alongside rickety gray wooden docks in the 
sounds southwest corner is one of five hatcheries that supply an 
average of 50 percent of the millions of pink salmon that surge 
each summer through the sound 
lamb said only san juan has a chance now 
the others further north in a chain of islands will suffer due 
to their distance from clean ocean waters their hundreds of 
millions of salmon fry must feed and swim much further through oil 
and have less chance of surviving he said 
even small amounts of the toxic oil can poison the fry 
san juan is the linchpin of the salmon fishery here lamb 
said 
other fisheries meanwhile are quietly shutting down for the 
year victims of the spill 
the last casualty came monday when the state department of fish 
and game closed the regions 12 million to 15 million herring 
season last week the sablefish and shrimp fisheries were shut 
officials have until may 1 to decide on releasing the salmon fry 
the salmon runs begin in late june and early july 
frank gurske of nearby chenega bay thinks it will take more than 
one hatchery to save the fishery much less his way of life 
nobodys going to buy the fish theyll be scared of the 
oil he said 
gurske who lays boom now is a fisherman married into an alaska 
native family 
we go hunting seals to sell to make our income in the winter 
we catch halibut bottomfish salmon that we put up for the winter 
we go out and get our meat our deer now all this is going to stop 
because of the oil spill this thing is going to hurt all life out 
there gurske said 
clomping along the dock in heavily oiled boots he said i 
dont know whats going to happen now were going to have to 
buy the food and we dont know how well do it 
its a mess

macho muscle shirts clash with drippy 
highwater pants at jocks and nerds a fashion exhibit that 
celebrates and spoofs 20thcentury men 
the two stereotypes are among 12 categories being explored 
through may 16 in an exhibit at the fashion institute of technology 
that shows how men create images for themselves said curator 
richard martin 
mannequins are transformed into jocks nerds rebels workers 
cowboys military men hunters sportsmen joe college 
businessmen men about town and dandies 
a mans clothing reflects his personality although perhaps 
not in a purely conscious way martin said 
someone can be a businessman five days a week but on saturday 
he puts on his safari jacket and becomes the ernest hemingway of 
great neck said martin at night he goes to a downtown club 
and becomes a rebel 
or perhaps a jock depicted here in photographs of sylvester 
stallone as rocky a reclining jim palmer pitching jockey 
underwear and a comic book outlining charles atlas rise from 
97poundweakling to heman 
jocks go in and out of favor in the late 1960s and early 
70s the antiestablishment time jocks were portrayed as dumb 
said martin but they are always perceived as sexy 
indeed the classification of mens underwear into jockey and 
boxer shorts both alluding to sports seems to imply that the 
sanction of athletics is required for manly attire notes the 
jocks and nerds catalog 
nerds have other qualities 
the exhibit noted martin features our 80s nerd complete 
with white socks highwater pants and black glasses beautifully 
made clothing that really respects the history of the nerd the 
pattern mix the ungainliness the tshirt under the open collar of 
a 1950s nylon shirt in a really icky material 
a nerd he said might wear a shortsleeve shirt under a sweater 
vest making his arms too cold and his chest too hot it causes a 
real sense of discomfort and the nerd projects that 
nerds surfaced in the 1950s and a funny thing happened to them 
in recent years the downtown club people suddenly started 
buttoning their top button and wearing highwater trousers said 
martin 
also featured in the exhibit is a crowd of mannequins offering 
blasts from the past a paisley nehru suit cowboy chaps made of 
sheepskin and skunk on loan from the buffalo bill museum in cody 
wyo loud pants patterned with golf tees and balls once favored 
in palm beach and a black velvet suit with bellbottom pants 
donated by martin who cant believe i wore that 
and martin pointed out a collection of great bizarre ties 
with pictures of hula dancers marilyn monroe cocker spaniels 
horses there are always some men who are quite conventional but 
who will buy the most extraordinary ties he said 
the clothing was borrowed gleaned from staffers attics and 
scrounged at flea markets 
we were real crazed fleamarket shoppers wed get there the 
minute the doors opened said martin who usually hates to shop 
but discovered he would go wild and become the worst sort of 
grabby shopper while building the collection 
he said its believed to be the first exhibit of 20th century 
mens clothing 
most museums have collected great womens clothing but have 
very little concern for mens clothing said martin its very 
difficult to find historic mens clothing men tend to wear it 
until it wears out

gov evan bayh said today that he will 
abolish indianas specialassignment prison release program which 
has been criticized since a furloughed inmate was accused of 
killing his exwife 
bayh also endorsed a recommendation from a sevenmember 
department of correction panel to establish a bill of rights to 
better protect crime victims and witnesses 
bayh ordered the panels study after alan matheney was charged 
with fatally beating his exwife march 4 while on an eighthour 
pass from the correctional industrial complex in pendleton 
matheney was serving an eightyear prison sentence for battering 
lisa marie bianco he now faces murder and burglary charges in her 
death and could face the death penalty if convicted on both counts 
authorities say neither bianco nor the st joseph county 
prosecutor were told that matheney would be released on a pass 
despite their requests for notification 
the panel led by corrections commissioner james e aiken 
recommended the abolishment of the special assignment program 
which allows certain inmates who are not near the end of their 
prison terms to work in the community during the day those inmates 
also have been allowed unescorted leaves of up to 48 hours once a 
month 
the panel also recommended tighter controls on eligibility 
requirements for other minimumsecurity programs and closer 
monitoring of offenders criminal histories 
the priority is to protect the public aiken said noting 
that the corrections department is looking now at where the inmates 
who no longer qualify for prison release programs will be housed 
during the next 180day crunch period 
almost 400 inmates involved in the three minimumsecurity 
programs will be sent back to the general prison population because 
of the drastically tightened eligibility requirements bayh 
said 
the panel also recommended that offenders not be allowed to 
leave a work release center except for employment or educational 
purposes without a leave approved by the director the panelists 
also suggested random telephone calls to ensure that offenders 
released into the community shortly before their terms are 
completed are following department rules

a law giving one of chinas freeenterprise 
cities the right to make its own laws ran into unprecedented 
opposition in the legislature tuesday and after passage a member 
demanded a recount from the floor 
negative votes or abstentions were recorded on all nine laws or 
motions presented on the last day of the annual legislative 
session all were approved by large margins 
one of the most important measures give people the right to sue 
officials but a western legal expert said its purpose was to 
increase central control not protect the rights of citizens 
the law that caused the stir in the national peoples congress 
gave special legislative freedom to shenzhen a city in guangdong 
province 
most of the 2688 deputies supported the bill but 274 voted 
against it and 805 abstained in the greatest show of opposition 
since the legislature was established 40 years ago 
fellow deputies cheered when huang xunxin representing taiwan 
spoke out against the bill from the floor he said the congress was 
usurping powers of guangdong province and other cities also would 
demand autonomy 
a woman deputy screamed for a recount but her demand was 
ignored a third member strode to the microphone after the vote to 
repeat his opposition 
it was an unusual performance in a legislature that customarily 
rubberstamps communist party policies but was more indicative of 
the sessions conservative tone than of a new independent spirit 
chinas leaders stressed to the congress that power must be 
recentralized but the new law does the opposite in shenzhen one 
of the special economic zones where most capital is foreign and 
most products are intended for export 
at last years congress by contrast legislators made bold 
statements about the necessity for ambitious economic reform 
this year the reform program started in 1978 to introduce 
market forces received several setbacks and political reform was 
put on hold human rights was labeled an abstract concept and 
control of the staterun press was tightened 
at the start of tuesdays session the legislature approved a 
report given by premier li peng on opening day march 20 it 
stressed the need for social stability and a return to centralized 
economic power 
lis report was a reaction to such economic problems as record 
annual inflation of 36 percent widespread corruption and scarcity 
of staple goods he recommended at least two years of austerity and 
restoration of government controls over some aspects of the economy 
other reports approved by the legislature put new taxes and 
restrictions on fledgling private and collective enterprises the 
most active part of the economy 
deputies also passed a budget equivalent to 772 billion that 
devotes more money to education and agriculture and has a deficit 
equal to about 2 billion 
in its resolution approving the premiers report the congress 
called for stronger central management and adherence to such ideals 
as socialist morality collectivism thrift and hard work 
members made 120 changes in lis report most of them minor one 
that requires feasibility studies for major policies apparently was 
designed to keep powerful ministers from making decisions 
recklessly 
another change revives a modelworker program which seems to be 
a step back toward the days when portraits of socialist worker 
heroes adorned post office walls 
the law allowing citizens to sue the government takes effect in 
october 1990 it gives people the right to sue officials for 
specific acts but not to challenge laws or regulations 
a western legal expert who attended the congress said its aim 
was to further centralization of power by using the threat of legal 
action to restrict the often wide powers of middlelevel officials 
he said it is not designed to protect the rights of citizens 
even though it is couched in such language 
if an official follows the states laws and regulations then 
he is immune but if he ignores those regulations someone might 
bring him to court he said that is the message here 
as with the opening session 84yearold senior leader deng 
xiaoping was absent deng said he excused himself to preserve his 
health

costa rican president oscar arias sanchez said 
today its time to change bullets for ballots in central 
america but that cannot be done without the support of cuba and 
the soviet union 
following a meeting in the oval office with president bush 
arias praised the united states for finding a joint 
executivelegislative compromise on a program of almost 50 million 
in aid for the nicaraguan contra rebels 
now people here can talk with one single voice he told 
reporters gathered in the white house driveway following his nearly 
hourlong meeting with bush i think this time they are 
indeed in good faith trying to support the efforts of the five 
central american presidents to reach democracy and peace at the 
negotiating table 
arias said that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who is 
visiting president fidel castro in cuba must persuade castro not 
to support guerrillas in el salvador if he supports sincerely the 
central american peace plan 
war has taught us that violence is not the solution he 
said i think we have learned that we must change bullets for 
ballots and we cannot do this without the support of cuba and the 
soviet union 
bush paused amidst a series of meetings with mideast leaders to 
get an update on the central american situation from arias who won 
the nobel peace prize two years ago for his mediation efforts in 
the region 
neither bush nor his guest would answer reporters questions 
during a picturetaking session at the outset of the oval office 
meeting 
press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters the two had a 
very friendly and productive discussion fitzwater said arias 
asked for us assistance in helping to negotiate loans with the 
international monetary fund and world bank to pay off costa rican 
debts and said bush agreed to look into that 
on central american policy the spokesman said that our 
fundamental common ground with costa rica is the two countries 
interest in democracy in central america both presidents agreed 
that their goals were demobilization of the contras and 
repatriation into their country fitzwater said 
he also said reported remarks by soviet spokesman gennady 
ge4rasimov about soviet opposition to export of revolution were 
very encouraging in terms of central america 
fitzwater said the comments could be very significant if they 
mean the reduction of soviet military support in nicaragua or if 
they mean that soviet surrogates would cease supporting leftist 
guerrillas in el salvador 
the talks with arias come more than two weeks after bush and 
bipartisan congressional leaders announced agreement on the new 
humanitarian aid plan 
taking reporters questions at the conclusion of his white house 
meeting arias said it was crucial that the repatriation of the 
counterrevolutionaries occur simultaneously with the institution 
of democratic reforms by the sandinista government headed by 
president daniel ortega 
otherwise he said you cannot persuade the contras to go back 
to nicaragua if you have nothing for them there you need a big 
carrot 
arias noted that there long had been arguments about whether the 
contras should lay down their arms following democratization moves 
by the sandinistas or whether they should be dismantled as a 
fighting force before such steps are undertaken 
i think this should be simultaneous he said with 
repatriation there should be a democratic climate in nicaragua or 
there is no reason for them to go back 
arias however said he told bush he was concerned about how 
free elections could be achieved in nicaragua noting there had 
been no such elections there in some 50 years 
i am really worried as a costa rican about the organization of 
the next elections he said 
bush acknowledged last friday that there was not a snowballs 
chance in hell of getting a dime of military aid for the 
counterrevolutionaries 
the bush administration is demanding as the reagan 
administration did for eight years that the sandinistas make good 
on promises of democratization they made to the organization of 
american states in 1979 at the time they overthrew the 
dictatorship of anastasio somoza 
in the meantime arias is pushing a new plan aimed at 
dismantling the contras in exchange for free and open elections in 
nicaragua by february 1990 
arias scheduled the washington visit while passing through en 
route to an official visit to canada said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
bush said last friday that by getting humanitarian aid that 
goes with this february 1990 election i am hopeful that the 
nicaraguans will go forward and do that which they give rhetorical 
support for but that which theyve failed to implement and that 
means democracy free certifiable elections

the nato alliance shaped out of the 
fears of soviet expansionism turned 40 on tuesday with western 
officials expressing caution and uncertainty about the dramatic 
changes gripping the soviet union 
manfred woerner secretarygeneral of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization said the soviet union will still 
remain a strong military power even if promised cuts are carried 
out in troops and military spending 
the intentions of the current soviet leadership are 
peaceful ones woerner told a news conference at nato 
headquarters in brussels soviet president mikhail s gorbachev he 
said doesnt want to wage a war 
but he cautioned there is still a risk because intentions may 
change we have no control over them personalities leaders may 
change 
woerners remarks capped a morning of ceremonies marking the 
signing of the nato treaty on april 4 1949 forming a security 
alliance that links the united states and canada with western 
european nations the western nations joined the pact to unite 
against the threat of expansionism posed by moscow in the years 
following world war ii 
gorbachevs recent agenda of economic and social reforms and his 
promises of military cuts have diminished the publics perception 
of that threat and raised questions about natos role 
anniversary speeches celebrations and a few protests held 
elsewhere in europe reflected the new situation 
british defense secretary george younger in a speech at nato

namibian policemen battling 
black nationalist guerrillas are combathardened fighters more 
accustomed to bush warfare than routine law enforcement 
the black patrolmen and their mainly white south african 
officers wear military uniforms and move about in heavily armored 
personnel carriers equipped with machine guns 
they have played a leading role in fighting guerrillas of the 
southwest africa peoples organization since a special police 
counterinsurgency unit was formed in 1979 13 years after the black 
nationalist fighters began the war for independence from south 
africa 
known as koevoet the afrikaans word for crowbar the unit 
officially was disbanded in january as a goodwill gesture after 
south africa agreed to end its rule of namibia 
however most of koevoets estimated 3000 men were integrated 
into the regular police and were ready for combat when heavy 
fighting erupted saturday as a ceasefire was suppposed to take 
effect 
guerrilla leaders accuse police of initiating the fighting by 
hunting down guerrilla units which had no intention of staging 
attacks 
under the ussponsored united nations plan for namibias 
independence guerrilla and south african troops as well as those 
of the southwest african territorial force were to be confined to 
their bases from saturday the territorial police force of 8300 
men was entitled to operate freely with full responsibility for 
maintaining law and order during the transition to independence 
more than 90 percent of namibias policemen and soldiers of its 
territorial force are blacks they are led by white officers 
mainly south african most south african army troops in namibia are 
white 
koevoets history is clouded with controversy its effectiveness 
is widely acknowleged but many namibians attribute its success to 
ruthlessness several dozen of its members have been accused of 
atrocities against civilians although only a few have been 
convicted 
koevoet claims to have killed 2812 guerrillas between 1979 and 
1988 for the loss 132 black and 19 white members 
leaders of the guerrillas legal political wing in namibia 
describe koevoet members as programmed killers who will be 
required to undergo reorientation if the guerrillas win 
independence elections 
defenders of koevoet say the criticism is tacit acknowledgement 
of the units prowess 
counterinsurgency work is not very easy and sometimes things 
get a little tense koevet commander gen hans dreyer said last 
month but without the support of the local people we would not 
have had any success 
in a standard koevoet operation four armored personnel carriers 
with 10 blacks and a white commander each would head into the bush 
for a week at a time questioning villagers and looking for traces 
of guerrillas 
koevoet trackers sometimes would follow a trail for days even 
crossing into angola where most of the guerrillas are based most 
namibian policemen are recruited in the north of the country among 
the ovambo people who are famed for their tracking and other bush 
skills 
the guerrillas almost always were on foot and often were 
mismatched when overtaken by the personnel carriers or by 
helicopter gunships which koevoet would call in

the federal deficit should not be an obstacle 
to serving all handicapped and disadvantaged students eligible for 
help under federal programs the president of the nations largest 
teachers union said tuesday 
i do not believe that the children of america created the 
deficit said mary futrell president of the 19 millionmember 
national education association 
the organization is calling for an extra 10 billion in federal 
education spending to counter a shocking erosion in services 
under four major programs for disadvantaged students lowincome 
college students handicapped students and students with limited 
proficiency in english 
in a report called federal education funding present 
realities and future needs the group says many federal programs 
reach only a fraction of those they are meant to serve serving all 
students currently eligible for the four programs would cost more 
than 10 billion it says 
im not an expert so i cant say where we would get the 
money futrell said at a news conference but she said the union 
has offered to sit down with bush administration officials and 
members of congress to look at the overall budget and rearrange 
priorities 
we are aware of the fact that we cant do this in one year 
futrell said it might take five years or 10 years but whats 
important is that we recognize the problem and make the 
commitment to fully fund these programs in 1993 or 1998 
the report looks specifically at chapter 1 grants to bolster 
basic skills among disadvantaged younsters the education for all 
handicapped act which helps states educate disabled youngsters 
bilingual education grants to make sure students with native 
languages other than english succeed in school and pell grants for 
college students from lowincome families 
the nea reported the following statistics 
chapter 1 the number of students served declined from 7 
million in 198081 to 57 million in 198889 the program reached 
65 percent of eligible students in 198081 but only 40 percent by 
1986 
congress provided 46 billion for chapter 1 in fiscal 1989 
enough to serve 47 percent of eligible students to serve the 
estimated 85 million who will qualify next year would cost about 
69 billion a 23 billion increase over current levels 
handicapped the federal share of costs to local school 
districts started at 12 percent 15 years ago and was intended to 
rise gradually to 40 percent instead it stayed at 12 percent until 
1980 and has fallen to 7 percent today to reach the 40 percent 
target would cost 84 billion a 65 billion hike over current 
levels 
bilingual education such programs serve one in 18 of students 
who need help in english skills an increase of more than 1 
billion would be needed to serve all 16 million students states 
say are eligible 
pell grants such funds have increased slightly when adjusted 
for inflation but the increases have not come near matching the 
soaring costs of postsecondary education in addition congress has 
fallen far short of meeting its own authorized maximum fore 
individual grants some 600 million would be needed to fully fund 
the maximum 2900 pell grant permitted in fiscal 1990 
the nea report was based on charts provided by federal planning 
services inc of washington dc an independent statistical 
analysis firm and statistics from government agencies including 
the education department and the census bureau

the navy has postponed its april test shot of 
the trident 2 missile to give investigators more time to find the 
cause of last months failure the pentagons chief spokesman said 
tuesday 
the spokesman dan howard declined to provide a tentative date 
for the rescheduled test beyond saying it would probably be in 
early may 
he said the delay did not necessarily mean the entire test 
program for the navys newest and most potent weapon had suffered a 
serious setback 
were talking about a mechanical problem of some sort and the 
broad evaluation by experts is that mechanical problems are easier 
to solve than some other types of problems howard said 
the analysis to date of the telemetry data indicates that the 
missile control was lost due to a mechanical failure in the after 
end of the firststage motor until the investigation is completed 
and the extent of the corrective action is determined we simply 
cannot assess the impact on the overall program 
howard further disclosed on tuesday that the navy had discovered 
a large debris field from the failed test on the bottom of 
the atlantic ocean at a depth of about 2500 feet parts of the 
firststage rocket motor have been sighted he added 
the navys investigation began march 21 shortly after a trident 
2 missile fired from the submarine tennessee blew up just four 
seconds after launch the missile popped to the surface as planned 
and the first stage ignited properly but then the missile began 
spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded 
it was the first submarine launch of the new longrange nuclear 
missile 
according to howard the firststage rocket nozzles of the 
missile are supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the 
weapon on a 19degree angle of flight then another internal 
command is sent to the nozzles to straighten back up 
two motors are located in the missiles aft end to move the 
nozzles back and forth in this case the spokesman said the 
nozzles never straightened after the second command 
the threestage trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon 
that is the heart of americas naval nuclear deterrent the trident 
1 the new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to 
individual targets up to 6000 miles away 
the navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its 
undersea predecessors polaris poseidon and trident 1 and can 
match the targeting ability of landbased missiles even though it 
is launched from a submerged moving submarine

the massive alaskan oil spill could put the 
brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas at least 
temporarily environmental protection administrator william reilly 
said today 
we will take apart the environmental planning for every aspect 
of oil development in alaska and in other sensitive areas where the 
environment potentially could be threatened reilly told a house 
appropriations subcommittee 
asked by rep bob traxler dmich if the disaster in prince 
william sound would prompt a reevaluation of the environmental 
threat posed by oil development policy reilly added 
we are doing that as you know off the coast of california 
and the coast of florida looking at three proposed lease sales 
there for oil and gas that appear to have significant environmental 
concerns associated with them 
well do it in prince william sound and look very carefully at 
future contingency planning there and well do it on the north 
sslope i think we owe that to the environment we owe that to 
common sense 
rep bill green rny asked reilly if he meant that the 
administration would not move forward on a controversial proposal 
for oil exploration in the alaska national wildlife refuge until a 
review had been completed 
there is a very clear understanding that we will not move 
forward if we have any significant concerns that have not been 
resolved yes sir he responded 
reillys comments came just a day after interior secretary 
manuel lujan jr said the oil spill off alaska could become the 
petroleum industrys three mile island if steps arent taken to 
assure the public that oil developers are capable of protecting the 
environment 
lujans remarks to an oil and gas industry conference monday 
suggested the massive spill last month into prince william sound 
off alaska by the tanker exxon valdez could have long lasting 
effects on the petroleum industry if some public damage control is 
not undertaken 
it takes a long long time to recover from these things 
said lujan comparing the exxon valdez spill to the accident a 
decade ago at the three mile island nuclear plant in pennsylvania 
the nuclear industry has yet to recover from that accident 
if the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails 
among the us public then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil 
and gas development in the arctic national wildlife refuge 
offshore and in the public lands lujan told a conference of the 
national ocean industries association 
the group represents about 235 companies involved in offshore 
oil exploration and drilling 
lujan nevertheless emphasized that the bush administration 
continues to support environmentally sound oil development in 
the arctic refuge and declared unless we pursue a coordinated 
policy to develop this countrys domestic energy sources including 
offshore oil and gas every american will pay dearly for our 
failure 
president bush generally has supported offshore drilling but in 
one of his first steps as president ordered a review into the 
proposed sale of oil leases involving two areas off the california 
coast and one off the everglades in florida because of 
environmental concerns 
on the spill from the exxon valdez the worst oil tanker spill 
in us history lujan said inadequate recovery equipment likely 
prevented any chances of an effective cleanup within hours after 
accident the vessel ran aground during the early hours of march 24 
outside the port of valdez alaska 
if it happened again someplace now youd have the same 
disastrous situation the interior secretary told reporters after 
his speech to the petroleum industry group 
lujan said a key lesson learned from the accident is that 
cleanup equipment and preparedness for such a disaster must be 
improved 
we need to be a little bit more prepared said lujan 
i understand about 80 percent of the oil was lost in the first hour 
or two i dont know that we could ever have contained it maybe it 
got away too quick 
later he told reporters the kind of equipment that we have 
available isnt enough to take care of a spill like this 
he said it was found that floating containment booms broke and oil 
skimmers were of little help 
the characterization that the cleanup effort was doomed within 
hours of the accident has been disputed by some alaska fishermen 
who have complained that opportunities were missed when little was 
done while relatively calm weather prevailed for two days after the 
accident 
oil company officials have acknowledged they did not begin to 
deploy cleanup booms around the hemorrhaging tanker until at least 
10 hours after the accident 
exxon officials have blamed some of the delay on the government 
for not providing an early goahead to use chemicals to disperse 
the oil while fishermen and state officials have accused the oil 
company of misleading them as to their cleanup capabilities

rockets hit residential neighborhoods 
of kabul on tuesday killing at least five people afghan and 
foreign sources reported 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said up to 25 
people may have died his report could not be confirmed 
at least six rockets were said to have landed in or near the 
khair khanna and wazirabad sections close to the airport which has 
been a frequent target of moslem guerrillas fighting the 
sovietsponsored government 
it was the biggest rocket attack on kabul since five struck the 
airport march 14 wounding two people but causing no serious damage 
last summer and fall before soviet military forces left 20 or 
more rockets often hit kabul every day the red army completed its 
withdrawal feb 15 under a unmediated agreement 
foreign sources said privately at least eight people were 
hospitalized tuesday and another source reported 20 injuries state 
tv showed a burning bus it said was hit by a rocket 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said guerrilla 
attacks on jalalabad 75 miles east of the capital had weakened in 
the previous 24 hours 
reminded that the government had accused the usbacked 
insurgents and pakistani forces of massing men and arms for a new 
assault amani added it may be the calm before the storm 
he said two pakistanis captured 3 weeks ago and accused of 
spying would go on trial wednesday in kabul 
the afghan government often accuses pakistan of military 
involvement in the civil war but pakistan has denied it 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and the most active groups operate from pakistan on 
afghanistans eastern border soviet soldiers entered the war in 
december 1979 and an estimated 115000 were in the country when the 
withdrawal began may 15 1988 
amani said jalaladad was relatively calm in the 24hour 
period ending at sundown tuesday he described shelling of the city 
as sporadic and limited 
guerrillas besieged jalalabad on march 6 in their first major 
offensive since the soviets left the afghan army to carry on the 
fight alone 
government artillery and air attacks killed 85 of the enemy and 
wounded 48 in the past 24 hours amani said he gave casualties on 
the government side as two civilians and one soldier killed and two 
soldiers wounded 
casualty figures cannot be verified government and guerrilla 
reports customarily exaggerate the others losses and foreign 
reporters are not allowed into the jalalabad area 
most of the recent guerrilla rocket fire at jalalabad has come 
from kama about 12 miles east of the city and from surkhrod six 
miles to the west amani told reporters 
he said government forces opened firs and the enemy was forced 
to retreat amani said most of the insurgents were 15 to 30 miles 
from the city 
several scudb missiles supplied by the soviet union were heard 
being launched tuesday from kabul toward jalalabad which is on the 
main road to the pakistani border and near the afghan end of the 
khyber pass 
amani said the highway to jalalabad was open and an army convoy 
carrying food reached the city monday 
the pakistanis to be tried were captured near kandahar in 
southern afghanistan in midmarch and shown to foreign reporters in 
kaul a few days later they identified themselves as mohammed afzal 
and mohammed ashraf and said they were spying 
afghan law provides prison terms of 10 to 20 years for 
conviction on espionage charges amani said

the air force has discovered a problem with 
lubricant levels in a wing gear box on its b1b bomber fleet that 
is slowing the return of the bombers to the air the pentagon said 
tuesday 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said the strategic 
air command had cleared the b1b bomber fleet to return to flight 
status on sunday as individual planes underwent a final safety 
check and more than 35 of the planes would be flying tuesday 
during the course of the final safety checks however air force 
mechanics began discovering a problem with gear boxes that are part 
of the assembly to move the wings back and forth the spokesman 
continued 
howard said the air force now expects roughly 90 of the b1bs 
to be certified for flight operations by the weekend 
the problem involves a loss of the lubricant contained inside a 
sealed gear box that handles what is known as the angle gear drive 
shaft howard said that angle gear drive shaft is a key component 
of the wingmoving assembly 
according to the air force of 80 b1bs receiving the final 
safety inspection so far 70 showed insufficient lubricant levels 
inside that gear box 
howard denied tuesday the air force had uncovered any evidence 
showing that a loss of lubricant in that gear box was the cause of 
a march 27 incident that led to a weeklong grounding of the b1b 
fleet 
in that incident a b1b undergoing a preflight check at dyess 
air force base texas suffered a tear in a fuel tank when the left 
wing swung too far forward 
howard disclosed tuesday that accident investigators probing the 
mishap had discovered a fractured quill shaft in a main wing 
gear box and a fractured angle gear drive shaft 
other sources who insisted on anonymity said the air force 
does now suspect that a lubricant seal problem led to the march 
27 mishap probably by allowing too much torque pressure to build 
up on the shaft 
at first blush thats exactly what we believe caused the wing 
to go too far said one source theres a very definite 
connection 
howard referring to the two fractured shafts said we dont 
know what sequence those occurred in 
we dont know what the first cause was yet whether it was a 
procedural problem a maintenance problem or a hardware problem 
but simply in the course of investigating every possible problem 
that they could have had they did discover this potential problem 
with the lubricant 
the air force said the sealed gear boxes were manufactured by 
the sundstrand corp and when mechanics were finding one with 
insufficient lubricant it was being replaced and sent off to the 
contractor for repair 
i think its fortunate we had the incident at dyess on the 
ground because that led to the kind of detailed investigation that 
enabled us to catch something that we might not have caught 
added one air force source 
the fourengine b1b is the first addition to the manned bomber 
force in more than 25 years to improve its performance the plane 
features wings that can be swept forward or backward in flight the 
wings are normally swept back for highspeed attack runs and 
forward for takeoffs and landings 
built by the rockwell international corp the b1b has a 
maximum speed of about 1000 mph and a range of more than 7000 
miles 
the air force built 100 of the planes during the reagan 
administration to modernize the old b52 bomber force while it 
developed the new b2 stealth bomber three b1bs have been lost 
in accidents leaving 97 in the fleet

the first postchallenger mission said he felt some vulnerability 
as discovery rocketed into space last september 
the anxiety started about six minutes into the jarring ride 
long after the solidfuel rocket boosters had fallen away but 
while a trio of main engines were still blazing 
i remember thinking this is amazing that human beings can put 
together machinery like this recalled hauck a veteran of three 
shuttle missions and i remember thinking i hope this thing 
holds together 
hauck left the national aeronautics and space administration on 
monday for a pentagon post the 47yearold navy captain and 
vietnamera combat pilot said he will serve as an adviser to the 
chief of naval operations beginning in may

gina lollobrigida nino manfredi raf vallone and 
other italian screen stars have launched a campaign to reduce the 
growing number of foreign actors used in italian films 
we have to defend ourselves they do it in other countries 
why not here lollobrigida a sex symbol of the 1950s and 1960s 
said monday night at a meeting of the union of italian actors 
italian directors often dub actors voices after the film is 
shot making it easy to use foreign actors 
the difference between a foreign actor who comes to italy and 
the italian actor who goes abroad is that the italian must speak 
the language of that country said vallone

prosecutors demanded the death 
sentence tuesday for a professed north korean spy who told the 
court she wants to die to atone for killing 115 people in the 1987 
bombing of a south korean airliner 
prosecutor lee sanghyung also blamed north korean president kim 
il sung and the dictatorship in north korea for the grave crime 
of killing the passengers it was an unpardonable crime to 
mankind he said 
lawyer ahn dongil argued his client kim hyonhui was forced 
to commit the act and it is someone else who needs to be punished 
north korea 
ms kim 27 was a scapegoat of the worlds most isolated 
communist dictatorship ahn said to yells of abuse from relatives 
of victims 
why do you keep her alive some screamed kill her 
scores of other relatives were kept out of the courthouse by 
hundreds of police and security agents who ringed the building 
in her final testimony ms kim told the court i am really 
sorry for relatives of the victims i feel like dying to atone for 
what i did 
she too blamed the korean leader and his son and heir whom 
she says ordered her to bomb the plane i now curse kim il sung 
and kim jong il endlessly she said sobbing into a handkerchief 
the verdict and sentence will be issued april 25 
lee said ms kim might deserve sympathy because she was a 
puppet of north korea and had repented 
but as a signatory to the montreal convention that governs the 
safety of civil aviation the republic of korea is obliged to 
severely punish the defendant without fail irrespective of 
ideology he said 
ahn said ms kim should be kept alive to counter pyongyangs 
charges that she is a south korean agent and that the bombing was a 
frameup by seoul authorities 
government officials have indicated ms kim may get a 
presidential pardon because they say she was duped by north korea 
and has repented 
she said on south korean tv in january 1988 that she planted the 
bomb as part of a north korean plot to disrupt the summer olympics 
in seoul north korea denies involvement 
police explosives expert lt kim moonho testified tuesday that 
the mixture of explosives used in the bomb was so powerful it would 
have destroyed the aircraft in less than a second 
there would be no time no chance to contact anybody he 
said details of the bomb come from ms kim since little plane 
wreckage was found 
the korean air boeing 707 disappeared nov 29 1987 on a flight 
from baghdad to seoul over the andaman sea as it approached the 
burmese coast 
ms kim said she and another intelligence agent pretending to be 
japanese tourists planted the bomb when they flew from baghdad to 
abu dhabi 
the pair were arrested in bahrain shortly afterward and 
attempted to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes the other agent an 
elderly man died but ms kim recovered and was extradited to 
seoul 
in south korea defendants must stand trial even if they confess

liquor was once as much a staple of a mariners 
rations as bread and sights of drunken sailors in port were 
tolerated as compensation for hard lonely duty at sea 
but authorities said booze on board was banned by most us 
commercial shippers well before the alaskan oil spill that happened 
after the tipsy skipper allowed an uncertified third mate to 
operate the tanker 
the whole philosophy about drinking has changed its just not 
tolerated anymore said lt cmdr glenn epler of the coast 
guards crisis action center 
any hand whos drunk aboard a vessel makes it unseaworthy 
said carmine guastella who set up an alcohol rehabilitation 
program in 1977 for the national maritime union this is a black 
eye to the american merchant marine 
federal regulations that took effect in january 1988 prohibit 
commercial operators from having 004 percent alcohol in their 
blood drinking is also prohibited four hours before going on duty 
authorities said capt joseph hazelwood had a 0061 percent 
level nine hours after the exxon valdez lurched onto bligh reef in 
prince william sound gushing 101 million gallons of crude oil 
march 24 in the worst oil spill in us history 
hazelwood 42 was fired by the exxon corp which bans alcohol 
on its ships even to crewmen who are off duty the captain was 
twice arrested on drunken driving charges and his drivers license 
was suspended three times 
captains are required on their shipping license applications to 
report arrests for driving while intoxicated 
hazelwood was checked under new federal regulations that call 
for tests after a major accident federal officials had trouble 
finding a test kit but a coast guard corpsman used one supplied by 
exxon 
when asked by investigators what was the problem hazelwood 
said i think youre looking at it according to a court 
affidavit one crewman also said his balance was not good 
according to court documents 
the new rules about drinking followed 20604 commercial marine 
accidents involving drug and alcohol abuse between 1981 and 1986 
of the 1114 deaths and 960 injuries from all causes during that 
time 17 deaths and three injuries involved drug or alcohol use 
the coast guard said 
hazelwoods case is the most serious since the rules went into 
effect 
on sunday the crew of the century hope called the coast guard 
off long beach calif because it feared its captain was drunk 
allen jones 58 of ealing england voluntarily submitted to a 
bloodalcohol test and is being investigated for being drunk at the 
helm 
we havent found a lot of instances where commercial operators 
have been intoxicated its come up a handful of times said 
cmdr dave wallace of the coast guards casualty review branch 
its not widespread 
drinking on the high seas were once intertwined old refrains 
told about what do you do with a drunken sailor and yo ho ho 
and a bottle of rum 
in a tradition rooted in the rumpowered british navy us 
sailors were given a daily ration of spirits called a grog with 
their bread salt pork and peas 
the practice was banned in 1862 when sailors were compensated 
for their loss but a lament said theyve raised his pay three 
cents a day but stopped his grog forever 
all booze was banned in 1914 when the bluenosed teetotaler 
josephus daniels as secretary of the navy ended the custom of 
officers having wine in their quarters he earned the bitter 
nickname grape juice josephus 
aircraft carriers still have brandy hoarded by doctors for 
medicinal purposes and ships can still be christened with a bottle 
of champagne but a navy in which thirsty hands once swallowed 
alcoholbased torpedo juice during world war ii is officially dry 
federal regulations for drinking on pleasure boats are more 
relaxed 
pilots are allowed to have less than 01 percent alcohol in 
their blood although booze was the direct result of 158 deaths and 
135 injuries in 279 crashes in 1985 the coast guard said half of 
all pleasure boating accidents are thought to be related to 
drinking the coast guard estimated 
its much more stringent for operators of commericial 
vessels said lt cmdr paul milligan of the coast guards public 
affairs office in new york 
a tanker that has the potential of creating a major oil slick 
is more serious than going around a harbor erratically it can 
affect an ecology or the lifestyle of a whole community for years 
to come he said

a congresswoman is trying to win the 
release of a dutch visitor who was detained at a minnesota airport 
because he has aids 
hans paul verhoef 31 of rotterdam was being held by the 
immigration and naturalization service which declared he cannot 
enter the united states with an infectious and communicable 
disease said rep nancy pelosi dcalif 
verhoef had planned to attend the national lesbian and gay 
health conference that begins in san francisco on wednesday 
according to steve huber a conference spokesman 
we do not believe the intent behind the immigration law was to 
exclude tourists said pelosi who is approaching the us 
attorney general for a waiver that would allow verhoef to proceed 
to san francisco federal law prohibits people with aids from 
visiting the united states without such a waiver 
verhoef was taken to the scott county jail about 20 miles from 
the minneapolisst paul airport after us customs officials 
discovered the drug azt in his baggage on sunday according to a 
friend who was with him 
steve morin an aide to pelosi said verhoef told customs and 
immigration employees he had aids when he was questioned about the 
azt a drug used to treat people infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus 
he didnt try to hide it morin said we also question 
this on humanitarian grounds putting someone in jail under these

the united states on tuesday urged guerrillas 
of the southwest african peoples organization to pull back into 
angola and allow the namibian independence process to get under way 
the us statement came as fighting continued for the fourth day 
in namibia between thousands of sovietbacked swapo guerrillas and 
south african troops and local police 
swapos intention apparently was to establish bases in 
namibia in clear violation of a usbrokered peace agreement 
signed last december the pact negotiated over two years by 
assistant secretary of state chester crocker calls for cuba to 
pull its troops out of angola and for south africa to grant 
independence to neighboring namibia 
the agreement went into effect april 1 but was threatened by the 
fighting which has claimed 180 lives according to police figures 
that could not be independently verified 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the united 
states does not think the agreement is in danger of unraveling at 
this point 
us diplomats are still in touch with the soviet union cuba 
and angola asking them to use their influence with swapo to 
restore calm in namibia she said the united states for its part 
is asking south africa to rein in its troops who were scheduled to 
begin demobilizing sunday once the peace agreement went into effect 
and un peacekeepers were deployed 
the united states position is that swapo must withdraw the 
forces it has sent into namibia to north of the 16th parallel in 
angola ms tutwiler said under the peace agreement swapo 
guerrillas were supposed to stay in their angolan bases about 100 
miles north of the namibian border 
she said that despite rebel claims there was no doubt that the 
guerrillas had crossed the border on saturday 
guerrilla officials and the angolan government claim the 
fighters have been in namibia for some time and fired in self 
defense after security forces attacked them 
villagers in northern towns most of whom support the rebels 
said they believe the guerrillas left angola to return home and did 
not expect a fight because the independence process officially has 
begun 
asked whether the un force which has just 1000 of its 
planned 4650 soldiers deployed so far should have foreseen the 
swapo incursion ms tutwiler replied that hindsight is always 
great but i dont think anybody anticipated this

the peace proposals prime minister yitzhak 
shamir will submit to president bush focus on elections in the 
occupied territories to choose palestinians who would negotiate 
with israel on limited selfgovernment 
many prominent palestinians welcome the idea of balloting but 
argue that free elections cannot be held as long as israeli troops 
occupy the west bank and the gaza strip 
in interviews and through his aides shamir said he was willing 
to have palestinians choose mayors to speak for major population 
centers or political figures to represent the whole region 
the elected palestinians would then meet with israeli 
negotiators to work out a temporary solution for the 1 million 
residents of the west bank and the 650000 inhabitants of the gaza 
strip 
the most palestinians could expect from this process would be 
limited selfrule with israeli troops still stationed in the 
occupied lands but shamir has said troops could be pulled out of 
population centers once an autonomy scheme was agreed upon 
under shamirs proposals the final status of the west bank and 
gaza strip would be the subject of further negotiations after 
autonomy was implemented 
shamirs advisers also hint he is ready to release some 
palestinian prisoners and take other steps to reduce tension 
however they link any change to a truce in the palestinian 
uprising intefadeh in arabic in which 419 palestinians and 18 
israelis have died since december 1987 
the condition is that life in judea and samaria west bank 
must return to normal the intefadeh must end said yossi 
ahimeir a shamir spokesman the shamir ideas closely parallel the 
1978 usmediated camp david accords signed by egypt and israel 
but rejected by the palestinians and jordan the major difference 
is that shamir proposes electing negotiators before autonomy is 
implemented instead of members of an autonomous council after 
selfgovernment is defined in talks 
i believe that this will be the one big and important 
contribution that mr shamir is bringing to washington said an 
israeli official who described the proposal as a major change 
in the governments position 
shamir however rules out direct or indirect talks with the 
plo which means elected representatives could not act as 
intermediaries 
he gives palestinians little hope of seeing an end to occupation 
because he has rejected palestinian demands for statehood and 
refused to endorse the idea of returning any captured land to arab 
sovereignty 
in this the rightwing prime minister takes a harder line than 
defense minister yitzhak rabin and finance minister shimon peres 
the leaders of the leftofcenter labor party which shares power in 
the coalition government 
labor supports returning some of the captured land in exchange 
for peace agreements 
municipal elections have been held twice in the west bank since 
israel captured the land from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
in the last balloting in 1976 voters chose 23 mayors nearly all 
of them supporters of the plo 
only six remain in office with most of the rest having been 
deported or deposed by israel for nationalist activities 
in the gaza strip elections were last held in 1946 under 
egyptian rule 
the main flaw in shamirs plan is that he has been unable to 
find palestinians willing to go along with the elections proposal 
but some palestinians have met secretly with the prime minister or 
openly with military officials to discuss the idea 
saeb erakat a political science professor at the an najah 
university in the west bank city of nablus said that if as the 
plo has proposed israeli troops withdraw and turn over the 
occupied territory to un peacekeepers then we will consider 
elections 
he said electing city officials would be meaningless if 
occupation persisted 
will elected mayors be able to prevent arrests stop the 
deportation of palestinian leaders halt the confiscation of land 
or the closure of schools we would just wind up electing people 
who have the authority to collect the garbage said erakat 
soon after the uprising against israeli occupation began a 
group of prominent palestinians in jerusalem in january 1988 
presented a 14point list of demands that included a call for 
elections 
the idea was hotly debated among palestinians until bethlehem 
mayor elias freij proposed a ceasefire in the intefadeh or 
uprising in exchange for elections and the release of thousands of 
palestinian prisoners 
plo chairman yasser arafat responded by threatening to shoot 
anyone who proposed a truce and graffiti appeared on bethlehem 
walls threatening freijs life support for the idea rapidly waned 
hanna siniora editor of the proplo daily al fajr and a 
proponent of the 14point list said there was deep suspicion that 
shamir was meeting with palestinians and talking about elections in 
an effort to perpetuate the illusion that there are alternatives 
to the plo 
so far what we see from shamir is an attempt to repackage 
what was refused earlier autonomy under camp david said 
siniora a leading moderate

many of those involved in the fight against 
aids are lauding cartoonist garry trudeaus comic depiction of the 
ignorance unfounded fears and public indifference that sometimes 
surround the disease 
humor is essential for educating people said rene durazzo 
of the san francisco aids foundation it gets them to look at 
themselves without a lot of harsh confrontations gets them 
laughing at their own silly attitudes 
in a threeweek series of his doonesbury strip that began march 
27 and ends april 15 trudeau is gently dishing up some rather 
biting comments on how the public and government have responded to 
the disease 
centered around a town hall meeting in san francisco part of 
character lacy davenports congressional district the strip so far 
has poked fun at fears of getting aids through casual contact the 
view that aids largely affects only homosexuals and the publics 
discomfort at dealing with various sexual issues raised in its 
context 
at one point the 81yearold davenport finds herself unable to 
use the word aids instead saying the great unpleasantness 
a longtime character in the strip andy lippincott has 
developed aids 
trudeau told a columnist for the pioneer press dispatch of st 
paul minn this week that he had a hard time finding the right 
approach to aids 
i had to strip it the disease of its taboos to attack the 
fear and ignorance by laughing in its face said trudeau who 
rarely grants interviews he did not return a call placed by the ap 
brother kevin worth a roman catholic monk who works with aids 
patients at mother teresas spiritual resource center in oakland 
called trudeaus aids series an effective way of uncovering the 
publics ignorance about aids which destroys the bodys immune 
system 
lacy davenports unwillingness to name the issue represents a 
common response on the part of the american public much of which 
prefers that this disease simply did not exist or would just go 
away he added trudeau is showing us it will not 
according to lee salem a spokesman for universal press 
syndicate in kansas city mo which distributes the comic strip 
only one newspaper has refused to run the series the canadian 
paper which he did not identify considered the series in bad 
taste 
in san francisco where 9000 people are expected to be living 
with the disease by the end of the year the comic strip has been 
greeted with guffaws at numerous aids organizations 
lance henderson finance director of the names project which 
produces a giant memorial quilt using panels submitted by survivors 
of people who have died of aids is posting each segment of the 
daily strip on his door 
but some involved in the fight against aids are surprised the 
often controversial cartoonist known for his sharp political wit 
has taken so long to address aids issues 
i wish he had done this four years ago said democratic rep 
nancy pelosi of san francisco most of what ive seen so far is a 
little after the fact these issues have been raised before 
carisa cunningham of the gay mens heath crisis in new york feels 
it is appropriate that davenport represents a sometimes 
illinformed public and government officials who can be 
frustratingly prudish 
hes addressing the issue of denial in lacy who in the past 
has been a sympathetic character cunningham said in a telephone 
interview 
we arent meant to hate or despise her because of her 
ignorance its telling us that even wellmeaning people are having 
a hard time dealing with aids

voters turned out in large numbers to elect a new 
mayor tuesday as frontrunner richard m daley sought the office 
held by his father for 21 years and chief rival timothy c evans 
battled to keep black leadership in city hall 
maverick republican edward vrdolyak was not expected to be much 
of a factor in a contest democrats have won without fail since 1931 
including six straight terms captured by the late richard j 
daley last of the bigcity political bosses 
a victory by the younger daley who defeated mayor eugene sawyer 
in februarys democratic primary would make the nations 
thirdlargest city by far the biggest in the nation to replace a 
black mayor with a white 
tom leach spokesman for the chicago board of elections said 
that turnout was substantial all morning and appeared headed for a 
rate of 71 percent of the 156 million registered voters that 
would be the thirdhighest turnout for a chicago municipal 
election below the numbers that carried harold washington the 
citys first black mayor to victory in 1983 and 1987 
there was no early breakdown of how the turnout compared in 
mainly white and mainly black precincts 
the election was ordered by the courts to fill the two years 
remaining in the second term of washington who died of a heart 
attack in november 1987 
daley 46 is a threeterm cook county states attorney evans 
45 is a democratic south side alderman who skipped the primary to 
run on the harold washington party ticket vrdolyak 51 is a 
former democratic alderman who has not won elected office since his 
party switch in 1987 
a telephone poll released monday by the daily chicago southtown 
economist and wbbmtv gave daley 51 percent to 35 percent for evans 
and 3 percent for vrdolyak the poll had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 3 points 
daley who planned to visit the graves of his father and infant 
son voted with his wife maggie at a day care center near his 
home joking now i got two votes 
evans cast his vote and followed it with another prediction of 
victory saying its been a good struggle 
evans most prominent supporter jesse jackson also voted in 
the morning noting tuesday was the 21st anniversay of civil rights 
leader martin luther kings slaying 
this is not a day to throw bricks he said we must build 
with bricks

analysts agreed that turnout among black and white voters would 
be the critical factor whites make up about 48 percent of the 
voting population blacks about 42 percent and hispanics about 7 
percent 
but the black community that united around washington appeared 
bitterly divided this year between sawyer and evans who refused to 
endorse each other 
in the february primary daley beat sawyer by more than 100000 
votes in large part because many black evans supporters stayed 
away from the polls 
tuesday was daleys second bid for the mayoralty he lost in the 
threeway 1983 democratic primary won by washington 
vrdolyak advanced into tuesdays contest by winning the gop 
primary after a lastminute writein campaign unpopular with 
blacks for his city council opposition to washington vrdolyak 
generated little support in the general campaign 
daley far outstripped evans and vrydolyak in raising campaign 
funds collecting a warchest of about 65 million he also gained 
the endorsement of chicagos two largest daily newspapers 
like the primary the general election was largely free of the 
rancor and racial strife that characterized washingtons victories 
but evans and his supporters openly appealed to black voters not 
to relinquish control of local government to whites jackson urged 
the black community to keep the keys to city hall and evans 
told a rally last week that daley was getting ready to reopen his 
fathers plantation 
democratic national chairman ron brown a black and an ally of 
jacksons endorsed daley a partisan move that angered some blacks

a jewish refusenik whose emigration case had been 
pressed by british officials said tuesday he was given permission 
to receive medical treatment in london 
the case of georgy samoilovich has been on a list british prime 
minister margaret thatcher intends to raise with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev who is to arrive in london on wednesday 
undoubtedly the two events are connected samoilovich 66 
said in a telephone interview this is happening only thanks to 
the work of the two governments the british and the american and 
the work of my friends throughout the world 
in london a foreign office spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the action reflects a considerable achievement in 
anglosoviet relations 
the list mrs thatcher plans to discuss includes the wife of 
oleg gordievsky a top soviet spy who defected to the west in 1985 
officials confirmed tuesday the foreign office refused to say how 
many people are on the list 
the soviet decision came a day after a protest by about 40 
refuseniks in front of the british embassy in moscow who said they 
hoped the talks in london would help resolve their cases 
samoilovich who has lifethreatening lymphoma first applied to 
emigrate in 1979 he was sacked from a defenserelated job and the 
soviets have refused repeated applications on grounds he was 
involved with secret work samoilovich argues that everything he 
knew is now public material 
officials of the soviet visa office summoned him tuesday and 
told him the prohibition on his emigration due to access to state 
secrets had been removed samoilovich said 
refuseniks accuse soviet officials of applying regulations that 
allow them to deny emigration because of access to secrets in many 
inappropriate cases 
he said he was told he would be allowed to leave for medical 
treatment in london and that his wife vera and son viktor would 
be allowed to emigrate after they submit new documents to soviet 
officials 
samoilovich said he hoped to receive his international passport 
wednesday or thursday after using his internal soviet passport to 
prepare legal documents testifying that the entire family wishes to 
leave 
once in london he said he hoped not to return to the soviet 
union but would wait in britain for his family the family hopes 
to settle in the united states where it has close friends 
samoilovich said 
samoilovich has been offered free medical treatment both at 
londons staterun royal marsden hospital and in the united states 
at the hackensack medical college in new jersey 
a genevabased agency that helps to resettle soviet jews said 
tuesday the number who arrived in vienna in march was 3893 a 
10year high 
but it said only 114 or 29 percent wanted to go to israel 
most of the rest intended to go to the united states said reghina 
boucault spokeswoman for the intergovernmental committee for 
migration 
jewish emigration from the soviet union reached a peak of 51328 
in 1979 but then dropped sharply and in the mid1980s only about 
1000 a year were released 
in the past two years however many longtime refuseniks have 
been permitted to leave the soviet union and the number of emigres 
increased to more than 20000 in 1988

boa constrictors anacondas and 
pythons are not uncommon pets according to a resident who is suing 
to hang on to 16 of his household snakes that the city says are 
banned from dwellings 
eric larson 26 says his snakes the biggest of which is a 
13footlong green anaconda named annie never slither out of his 
apartment 
city officials were tipped about the snakes by an anonymous 
caller in february said lori finazzo an assistant city attorney 
this is a multiresidential area and were not talking about 
some small garter snakes she said we have some serious 
pythons here 
officials contend larson is violating an ordinance that 
prohibits keeping uncommon pets within 300 feet of a dwelling 
common pets include cats dogs and gerbils our ordinance is 
quite clear and hes in violation of it finazzo said 
macomb circuit judge raymond cashen issued a temporary 
restraining order against the city last week and set a hearing for 
april 24 on larsons suit 
larson who has kept snakes since he was a child defended his 
pets as quiet 
its not as bad as a kitty litter box he said larsons 
lawyer charles langton says he knows one pet shop owner who sells 
300 to 400 boa constrictors and pythons each year 
and thats just one store so that puts the big snakes into 
the realm of common pets langton said theres a lot of snakes 
out there people may not know it but theyre out there

although restaurant customers remain their top 
priority americas premier chefs are catering more and more to 
charities that are capitalizing on the nations appetite for fancy 
but healthy cuisine 
its a bit of an ego trip to be able to say i had dinner last 
night with seven of the finest chefs in the united states if this 
is what turns you on its a pretty big trip said robert l 
becker jr board chairman at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
the hospital has invited seven top chefs to dish out their best 
at a 1500aperson gourmet gala in october half the 100 dinner 
tickets already have been gobbled up solely through word of mouth 
the fundraising crowd is getting bored with always eating 
meat and potatoes said jean banchet chef and owner of le 
francais in wheeling ill near chicago they dont eat garbage 
anymore they know more and more about food all kinds of food 
theyre more educated of the palate 
banchet is one of the chefs donating their talents for 
childrens hospital the worlds leading pediatric liver transplant 
center the hospital will launch its 1990 centennial celebration 
with the culinary extravaganza 
at a preview luncheon monday banchet showed off the mille 
feuille of duck liver with artichoke truffle and toast brioche he 
will create in october cajun cook paul prudhomme whipped up his 
offering a creamy crawfish dish served in bread boats and called 
louisiana seafood fantasy 
the menu also features a consomme of wild mushrooms grilled 
marinated quail california garden greens saddle of lamb and an 
apple dessert with kilndried cherry sauce and topped with a sugar 
dome 
gourmet chefs became highly sought after for these kinds of 
highbrow fundraisers in the early 1980s according to lawrence 
forgione chef proprietor of an american place in new york 
it only came about because of the notoriety of chefs for lack 
of a better word the star quality of chefs forgione said 
what would be the sense if the chefs who are here today had no 
influence why bother paying to come to this event 
top chefs say they are besieged with requests to donate their 
services 
its worthwhile doing and hey its going to have a lasting 
effect that money is going to pay for a lot of good things thats 
why we do it said prudhomme owner of kpauls louisiana kitchen 
in new orleans 
you cannot say yes to all of them said another guest chef 
jeanlouis palladin of jeanlouis at watergate in washington 
every day of the year we would be doing that and we cannot 
because we have our job to do 
whether its for charity or for profit chefs with any 
conscience are blending what people want to eat with what they 
should eat according to ferdinand metz president of the culinary 
institute of america under fire are highcalorie highcholesterol 
foods 
its not just the responsibility of the chefs to wait and say 
well lets wait to see if they become more sophisticated 
said metz who is baking the dessert for the gala we have a 
responsibility to lead and im actually somewhat disappointed in 
the lack of corporate responsibility that i see on the part of some 
of the fastfood people 
education is the main ingredient to healthy eating and the new 
york institutes 22000 graduates are busy spreading the word 
according to metz 
the message will get around he said its an enormous 
undertaking but i think were making progress

the rights of television viewers are being 
trampled by laissezfaire federal regulators who no longer require 
tv stations to broadcast public affairs programming consumer 
advocate ralph nader said tuesday 
nader appearing at a news conference to discuss a study that 
said there has been a 51 percent decrease in issuesoriented public 
affairs tv programs since 1979 called for reinstatement of the 
fairness doctrine and requirements that broadcasters devote certain 
percentages of their broadcasting hours to nonentertainment 
programming 
the federal communications commission in 1987 repealed the 
40yearold fairness doctrine which had required broadcasters to 
cover controversial issues in 1984 the fcc revoked rules that 
obligated broadcasters to alot 5 percent of their programming 
between 6 am and midnight to local shows 5 percent to news and 
public affairs programs and 10 percent to general interest items 
such as as gardening religion and advicetype shows 
nader said the fcc under chairman dennis r patrick and his 
predecessor mark s fowler was a rogue agency that has 
dangerously transformed power from the public to private commerce 
in sheer violation of the 1934 communications act 
nader said fowlers view was audiences have no first amendment 
rights fowler and now patrick maintained that marketplace 
pressures would force station owners to broadcast issuesoriented 
programs 
that has not happened nader said and the fcc refuses to 
respect the access rights the response rights of the audience 
nader said that the fcc has abdicated its responsibility to 
monitor the broadcasting industry and that if it had it would have 
found an erosion of public interest programming in the wake of the 
1984 repeal of the socalled 5510 guidelines 
the study by essential information a public interest group that 
nader founded in 1982 examined tv listings for programs at 217 
stations in 50 markets on seven days in early 1988 
the listings were compared with fccrequired program logs from 
1975 1978 and 1979 the study did not include cable tv 
jim donahue who wrote the study said the results show a 51 
percent decrease between 1979 and 1988 in the average percentage of 
issueoriented public affairs programming 
he also said that the average percentage of time devoted to 
public affairs has decreased 39 percent with 30 percent of abc 
cbs and nbc affiliates and 63 percent of fox broadcasting 
affiliates neglecting to air a locally produced public affairs 
program 
donahues study also showed there has been an 74 percent 
increase in news programs and sharp increases in home shopping 
real estate and programlength commercials such as how to lose 
weight or get rich 
fcc spokesman john kamp said the report sounds terribly bogus 
we have increased the number of stations over the last 10 years 
both television and radio by half and news and public affairs 
programming makes money i find it incredible to think that the 
amount of this programming would go down so i dont know how he 
counted it but i think its subect to being recounted 
regarding the fairness doctrine kamp said the commission 
found that it decreased the amount of public interest programming 
available which was the opposite of what it was intended to 
do

race was the underlying issue in chicago where elections tend 
to divide voters by color more than party daley 46 the cook 
county states attorney captured overwhelming white support in the 
february democratic primary to oust the citys second black mayor

sawyer had been appointed acting mayor following washingtons 
death in november 1987 his chief rival at the time had been evans 
a fellow black democratic alderman who later formed the harold

sawyer was supported in the primary election by jesse jackson a 
chicagoan who casts a long shadow in local elections jackson then 
abandoned the democratic nominee daley to endorse evans 45 in 
the general election

democratic alderman had been washingtons archfoe but has been 
unable to win elective office since switching to the republican 
party in 1987

a turkey point nuclear plant already off line 
because operators failed routine retesting was shut down completely 
after technicians discovered a tiny coolingwater leak officials 
said tuesday 
the leak was found in the weld around a tube holding instruments 
that measure conditions in the core of the unit 3 reactor said 
nuclear regulatory commission spokesman ken clark 
several leaking and cracked tubes were found in the same 
location in january forcing florida power amp light co to shut the 
reactor down at that time as well 
a weeping tube in and of itself normally is not serious but a 
situation like this deteriorates and the utility usually shuts it 
down clark said 
until the leak was discovered saturday unit 3 had been on hot 
standby in the wake of the nrcs discovery that half of the plant 
operators taking regular recertification tests had failed the leak 
forced the utility to completely shut down the reactor 
nrc examiners are expected to review later in the week the 
performance of all the plants reactor operators a process that 
usually takes several days 
repairing the leak and retesting the reactor and the 
coolingwater system will delay unit 3s restart even longer 
utility spokeswoman stacey shaw said the utility originally had 
hoped to get the reactor back on line by the weekend but the 
delays are likely to add another week she said 
were moving along a step at a time said ms shaw 
the other turkey point reactor unit 4 is down for routine 
refueling and is projected to go back on line in mid to late 
april she said 
the nrc has hit turkey point with about 1 million in fines over 
the past five years for safety and security violations identifying 
the plant as one of the nations 10 worst ralph naders 
environmental group public citizen has also called it one of the

sprucecovered mountains rearing from the beach how will they fish 
or find other food when they leave their winter dens 
they will die lawn said 
that spash thats a seal he said pointing just offshore 
at the velvety blanket of oil undulating on the water that seal 
is going to die lawn said that thing floating next to it is 
already dead its probably an otter 
down the beach lawn spotted something else snorting and diving 
that sea lion is swimming in black oil theres no clean water

dead he said 
theres no clean water wheres he going to go 
up ahead gulls some partly oiled sat on tall black rocks 
theyre trying to stay out of the water lawn said they dont

a glittering collection of gold jewelry and 
ornaments from west africa where gold was shunned in ancient times 
as an evil spirit begins a threeyear ninecity tour of the 
united states on wednesday at the smithsonian institutions 
national museum of african art 
the handiwork of goldsmiths from ghana ivory coast mali and 
senegal comes from the private barbiermueller museum of geneva 
which houses one of the finest collections of african gold 
sculpture in the world 
more than 150 handmade objects comprising about half of the 
barbiermueller collection are going on display at the 
smithsonian they include elaborate necklaces rings hair jewels 
pendants masks earrings beads and ceremonial regalia such as 
golddecorated fly whisks sword handles and staffs 
guest curator timothy garrard a british historian and authority 
on the gold trade in west africa said gold dust and nuggets long 
were regarded with fear by natives who believed they would cause 
blindness and insanity 
africans began their goldsmith traditions in the 5th century 
when european traders alerted by slave merchants sailed down the 
west coast of africa or crossed the sahara desert in caravans from 
north africa to trade salt and spices for gold 
very little of ancient west african gold jewelry exists today 
because it was lost in trade looted from burial grounds and melted 
down to make coins or new ornaments garrard said the oldest piece 
in the smithsonian show probably is a fish pendant in pure gold 
about 22 carats from 18th century ghana 
after the show closes at the national museum of african art on 
aug 28 it is scheduled to travel through july 1992 to art museums 
in new york dallas birmingham ala tampa fla chicago

costa rican president oscar arias on tuesday 
said president bushs efforts on central american peace are welcome 
after the lip service of the reagan years and should be an 
example for the cubans and soviets 
arias who met separately with bush and vice president dan 
quayle endorsed the administrations plan for nonlethal aid to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels a plan developed with bipartisan 
support from congressional leaders 
now people here can talk with one single voice he said in 
contrast to years of division among members of congress and the 
reagan administration 
as for the situation in nicaragua itself he said he was 
concerned about the elections scheduled for february 1990 and said 
steps assuring fairness must be taken including giving all parties 
access to television and other mass media 
asked whether the nearly 50 million in nonmilitary aid 
recommended for the contras would not undermine the central 
american presidents proposal to disband the rebel army arias told 
reporters these people need some support 
he said disbanding of the contras and returning them to 
nicaragua must occur simultaneously with democratic reforms by the 
sandinista government 
the us decision not to revive military aid to the contras 
should spur reciprocal action by the cubans and soviets in el 
salvador added the costa rican who won the nobel peace prize for 
his efforts in bringing the five central american presidents to a 
regional accord in 1987 
arias said he told cuban president fidel castro that in view of 
the bushs emphasis on nonmilitary contra aid it was time for 
him if he supports our peace plan to stop supporting the 
guerrillas in el salvador 
arias also urged action by soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
who is currently on a visit to cuba 
if he supports sincerely the central american peace plan he 
has to persuade fidel castro not to keep the support of the 
guerrillas in el salvador war has taught us in central america 
that violence is not the solution we have learned that we must 
change bullets by ballots and we can only do this with the support 
of the cubans and the soviet union he said 
the united states has accused the soviets through their aid to 
cuba and nicaragua of supporting the leftist rebels in el salvador 
where the government is backed by the united states 
us officials also estimate that the soviets provide 1 billion 
a year half in military aid and half in economic assistance to 
the nicaraguan government opposed by the usbacked contras 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday that 
reported remarks by soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov about soviet 
opposition to export of revolution were very encouraging in 
terms of central america 
those comments could be very significant if they mean the 
reduction of soviet military support in nicaragua or if they mean 
that soviet surrogates would cease supporting guerrillas in el 
salvador said fitzwater 
in his oval office meeting with bush arias spoke of a need to 
have the united states and other democracies scrutinize the 
election rules set up by the nicaraguan government as well as next 
februarys election itself an administration source said 
later arias told reporters in a photo session with quayle that 
the nicaraguans must allow establishment of an independent 
television station with access by opposition parties as part of 
the proof that its elections will be free and fair 
the central american presidents had agreed that there should 
be equal opportunity and equal access to all mass media by all 
political parties otherwise it will be very difficult to talk 
about free elections he said 
he also said time must be allowed for such things as voter 
registration and fair campaigning 
comparing the bush administration to the reagan years arias 
said i breathe a new atmosphere a new environment because i 
have no doubts mr bush and the bush administration is going to 
sincerely support the guatemala accord the arias plan for 
central american peace 
this is something that in the past that i got some lip service 
when people mentioned they were happy with our efforts to 
democratize and bring peace to central america the neogtiating 
table arias said about the reagan years i think that now they 
are quite sincere and they are doing what they are doing in good 
faith 
he said he had discussed with bush his concerns about making 
sure the nicaraguan elections are fair 
i am really worried as a costa rican about the organization of 
the next elections he said though he also said he has no reason 
to doubt the sandinistas commitment to fulfilling their promises 
he noted arguments about whether the contras should lay down 
their arms following democratization moves by the sandinistas or 
whether they should be dismantled as a fighting force first 
i think this should be simultaneous he said with 
repatriation there should be a democratic climate in nicaragua or 
there is no reason for them to go back

when beef began to disappear from 
supermarkets last month and butchers took to the streets against 
illegal price increases many brazilians had a sinking feeling of 
deja vu 
three years ago powerful cattle ranchers defied a nationwide 
price freeze aimed at halting runaway 1000 percent inflation the 
shortages and black marketeering that followed doomed the 
governments plan 
now it seemed to be happening again 
the beef crisis alarmed the government president jose sarney 
called the shortage sabotage and said it threatened the fledgling 
democracy under which brazil on nov 15 will hold its first 
presidential election in 29 years 
brazil will not tolerate speculation fraudulent withholding 
of goods and crimes against the economy sarney said last week 
in a weekly nationwide radio program 
politicking and economic disorganization threaten the 
transition to democracy said sarney a civilian who took office 
in 1985 after 21 years of military rule 
inflation reached 288 percent a month in december then fell to 
3 percent for 11 days in february after the government froze 
prices but the cost of living rose 6 percent in march far above 
government predictions 
problems began soon after sarney on jan 15 announced a national 
wageandprice freeze as part of his summer plan brazils 
fourth antiinflation program in three years 
shortages soon began to occur eggs auto parts and cooking oil 
became scarce as suppliers said they couldnt meet demand at the 
governmentset price the government acted swiftly negotiating a 
tax break for auto industries and seizing 38 million cans of oil 
in a supermarket warehouse 
federal police even detained the supermarkets owner abilio 
diniz president of the pao de acucar chain and one of brazils 
wealthiest businessmen on charges of crimes against the public 
economy 
but the government was impotent against cattlemen for centuries 
a powerful and independent clan in latin americas largest country 
cattle breeders raised the price of beef to wholesalers from 18 
for each 32pound unit in january to 23 in march but wholesalers 
who tried to pass on the higher costs were fined by federal 
pricecheckers and many simply stopped sales altogether 
in many cities butcher shops sold meat on the black market or 
closed their doors supermarkets rationed beef to customers 
butchers in cars and oxcarts marched through downtown sao 
paulo brazils biggest city and financial center to protest the 
price increases riot troops broke up the march with water jets 
colored with pink dye 
the government vowed not to repeat the mistakes of 1986 when 
federal police on horseback and in helicopters tried to find cattle 
allegedly hidden in pastures police caught only a few cows for 
slaughter and the government was ridiculed 
this time officials threatened to ban beef exports and audit 
the tax returns of price violators but the ranchers didnt budge 
in april the government agreed to discuss a price increase for 
meat to save its antiinflation program 
politics and inflation are closely linked in this country of 144 
million past failed attempts to halt inflation caused the 
popularity of sarneys centerright government to plummet and 
helped leftist parties to sharp gains in november municipal 
elections

the law prevailed over the heart tuesday as a family 
court refused to return a 3yearold filipino girl to the italian 
couple who illegally adopted her 
the case of serena cruz has gripped italy for weeks provoking 
newspaper editorials petition drives and even a hunger strike 
the tearful parents rosanna and francesco giubergia announced 
they will appeal to the european court of human rights in 
strasbourg france to get the child back 
the case focused attention on italys adoption system and the 
reasons that have led hundreds of italian families to look abroad 
to adopt children 
the family violated the codes of the law but not those of the 
heart said an editorial in il popolo newspaper of the dominant 
christian democrat party 
serena was brought to italy from the phillipines by the 
giubergia family in january 1987 and taken away from them by a 
judge last month 
the couple from racconigi near turin admitted they lied in 
the adoption procedure to skirt the red tape francesco giubergia 
36 head of shipping for the state railway in turin had gone to 
manila and declared that he fathered the child 
the couple legally adopted a filipino boy in 1985 after mrs 
giuberia 34 was advised by her doctors not to have children 
a judge ruled they could no longer have custody of serena on 
grounds it would only encourage illegal adoptions and placed the 
child in an orphanage march 16 
in tuesdays ruling the family court in turin said the child 
had not suffered psychological damage from the threeweek 
separation and therefore will be placed with a new legal family 
residents of racconigi 20 miles southwest of turin have formed 
a committee of solidarity with serena and gathered 70000 
signatures on a petition urging president francesco cossiga to 
intervene 
cossiga asked justice minister giuliano vassalli to look into 
the case vassalli then met with the family but said the court had 
the right to decide 
according to a report released last week by the institute for 
political and social studies in rome requests for adoption of 
foreign children in italy have increased as much as 1000 percent 
between 1984 and 1987 
the report entitled a house for every child 19841987 
said that about threequarters of the foreign adoptions in italy 
are not done through official procedures and are legalized only 
after the child has been brought to the country

a former navy procurement official said 
tuesday that he took thousands of dollars from defense consultants 
in return for providing inside information that would help private 
companies get military contracts 
stuart e berlin who headed an aviation systems branch of the 
navy procurement command made the admission at the trial of three 
teledyne electronics inc executives accused of conspiring to bribe 
him to influence the award of an equipment contract 
berlin testified that he had received at least 2000 in cash 
from a defense consultant in return for providing detailed 
information about an equipment contract teledyne was seeking from 
the pentagon 
on crossexamination defense attorney mark tuohey iii said 
youve been selling your country short for money for 10 years 
i have taken money for 10 years berlin said acknowledging 
receipt of thousands of dollars in payments that tuohey listed 
on direct testimony berlin told jurors that he received two 
1000 cash payments and possibly a third from consultant fred h 
lackner after providing detailed status reports about the 
pentagons decision to buy handheld radar test devices 
berlin who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and bribery 
last month said he fed information to lackner during monthly 
meetings they had from mid1985 to june 1988 
everything i knew or could find out about the procurement was 
passed on to mr lackner berlin said he testified that lackner 
told him that he was relaying the information to william l parkin 
a defense consultant retained by teledyne 
but lackner who has also pleaded guilty testified later in the 
day that he received only sporadic reports from berlin and got no 
information at all during 1986 
he was passing this on to mr parkin who was in turn passing 
this on to teledyne berlin said he testified that he had 
expected to receive about 25000 a onefourth share of the 
100000 that parkin was to be paid by teledyne for his services 
but lackner testified that he and parkin and another 
coconspirator agreed to tell berlin they were sharing 100000 
instead of 150000 the amount they expected to receive from 
teledyne adding everyone felt he really didnt do anything to 
aid the procurement 
parkin also pleaded guilty in the case and may testify as a 
prosecution witness against the three defendants george kaub 
eugene r sullivan and dale schnittjer 
the defense contends that the three teledyne executives knew 
nothing about the illegal activities of parkin lackner and michael 
savaides the companys washington lobbyist who has also pleaded 
guilty in the case 
earlier in the day however former teledyne vice president 
william rosen testified that he had attended a meeting during which 
kaub and sullivan agreed to hire parkin and pay him 150000 if 
teledyne obtained the contracts 
rosen conceded on crossexamination that he did not know whether 
the agreement with parkin he helped draft was ever executed 
rosen said he had hired savaides on berlins recommendation 
berlin said lackner had repeatedly over 15 years offered to go 
into business with him proposing arrangements to provide inside 
information to defense contractors for a price 
berlin said he spurned those offers until mid1985 when lackner 
proposed a deal involving teledyne i told him yes that i could 
help him 
during a subsequent meeting lackner said that he did have a 
contact who would work with teledyne and it looked like this could 
be profitable for all of us berlin added 
he told me that it was bill parkin he said bill parkin had a 
relationship with teledyne and could easily get a contract with 
teledyne 
berlin added that lackner said that he needed quantity and 
budget information that would enable teledyne to know the scope 
of the potential contract berlin said he was supposed to keep 
him posted on what was happening in the navy and the air force a 
daily status report 
berlin explained to us district court jurors that much of the 
information he passed to lackner was not supposed to be released to 
the defense industry because it could possibly give one 
competitor an unfair advantage over another 
by the spring of 1987 berlin said that lackner complained that 
he was having difficulty getting paid from teledyne 
the former navy procurement official said that he suggested 
several ways of pressuring teledyne including raising the 
possibility that the contract would be terminated or that the full 
threeyear term of the order would not be completed 
berlin said that lackner told him he was going to threaten 
them with termination of the existing contract and use any leverage 
he could to get paid 
berlin said that six months later lackner reported that he was 
to share a quarter of the 100000 that teledyne had agreed to pay

politics did not sway the energy departments 
choice of texas for the super collider according to a study of the 
site selection process by the general accounting office sen 
dennis deconcini said tuesday 
deconcini an arizona democrat requested the audit by congress 
investigative arm after senators from some of the six other 
finalist states charged politics was behind the does decision to 
locate the 46 billion particle accelerator at a site south of 
dallas 
the texas site was announced days after adoptedtexan george 
bush was elected president it was picked instead of sites in 
arizona michigan illinois north carolina tennessee and colorado 
to me it looked like it was political at the time it doesnt 
look as much that way now deconcini said arizona lost it fair 
and square although he said he was sorry to admit texas had 
the better site 
our limited analysis provided us no reason to question the 
decision to site the super collider in texas the gao said in 
testimony that will be given wednesday at a house hearing on the 
site selection process 
we found that the task force evaluated and rated the proposed 
sites in accordance with the technical and cost criteria and 
provided evidence to support its ratings gao said 
deconcini who was briefed by gao on tuesday said the study 
resolves his concerns about the selection process and he is now 
ready to support the particle accelerator in congress where it 
faces an uncertain future as the doe seeks approval and money to 
begin construction 
had it been a political decision i would have washed my hands 
of support deconcini said 
the gao however said it had unresolved technical questions 
about tunneling in illinois for the 53mile underground ring the 
theory used to evaluate the electrical power subcriterion and the 
impact of caves in tennessee on that proposed site 
gaos verdict is no surprise to those of us who have been 
heavily involved in pushing the project forward in recent years 
texas won the super collider for the best of reasons hard work and 
technical merit said sen phil gramm a texas republican 
deconcini said he would support funding the project on a 
limited basis because money is tight and he doesnt want to see 
other science projects especially in arizona cut to pay for the 
collider 
deconcini is a member of the senate appropriations subcommittee 
on energy and water development which will decide the colliders 
funding 
the bush administration is seeking 250 million for the 
collider including 160 million for initial construction in next 
years budget 
this is the third year the energy department has asked congress 
to authorize construction 
last year congress appropriated 100 million although the 
president had requested 363 million to begin initial construction 
pushing back the targeted date of completion the project is now 
targeted to be built by 1998 instead of the original 1996 
completion said doe spokesman jeff sherwood

voters in one out of every eight soviet 
parliamentary districts refused to elect anyone even though they 
had a choice of only one or two candidates according to official 
results released tuesday 
the tass news agency released the central election commissions 
final tally of the votes from march 26 elections for the countrys 
new 2250member congress of peoples deputies 
tass said that in 195 of the 1500 geographical districts across 
the country no one got a majority of the vote even though there 
were only one or two candidates in those districts new electoral 
campaigns will be waged and a second election will be held may 14 
tass said 
election results released earlier showed that in the first 
nationwide multicandidate election in 70 years voters rejected many 
topranking communist party and government leaders they included 
yuri solovyev a candidate member of the ruling politburo who ran 
unopposed in leningrad 
tass said a meeting of leningrad party leaders tuesday led by 
solovyev characterized the election results as a serious 
political lesson 
leningrad residents are not satisfied with the tempo of 
solving the housing problem the equipping of the city the 
ecological situation the agency said they express 
dissatisfaction with the shortage of industrial and food products 
and concern about the growth of crime tass said 
among those who also suffered defeat were the kiev party leader 
and mayor the mayor and secondleading party official in moscow 
and a host of regional party chiefs 
in the majority of cases the reason for this is the striving 
of the people to quicken the process of restructuring more 
actively struggle with bureaucracy and commandadministrative 
methods of work election commission chairman vladimir orlov told 
tass 
boris n yeltsin the former moscow party chief who waged an 
antiestablishment campaign won his race with more than 89 percent 
of the vote 
tass also indicated that party officials met in leningrad on 
tuesday to review the results of the election but no word was 
available on the results of that meeting 
the literary weekly literaturnaya gazeta reported that in at 
least one case a party leaders loss may result in a court case 
the paper said the party leader of alma ata capital of kazakhstan 
was taking his opponent to court for distributing 100000 leaflets 
accusing him of selling deficit items like meat perfume and sugar 
at his election rallies 
vi romanov the alma ata party leader lost the election to a 
safonov the director of a homebuilding enterprise 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said two days 
after the balloting that party organizations would have to review 
the status of top officials who lost their races he refused to 
characterize the vote as a defeat for the party saying the vast 
majority of those elected were party members 
official figures released tuesday indicated that 876 percent of 
those elected on march 26 were party members 
orlov told tass that nationwide voter turnout was 898 percent 
that high degree of activity gladdens us more than the 
notorious 999 percent participation which we were proud of 
earlier orlov said in this election there was no race for 
percentage of participation the previous mandatory measures 
practiced previously were fully excluded 
in the past the soviet union proclaimed an almost total 
participation in elections as proof of citizens satisfaction even 
though voters werent offered a choice 
tass said runoff elections will be held in another 76 districts 
sunday for seats in which the vote was split among three or more 
candidates such that no one received a majority 
onethird of the new congress will consist of deputies elected 
by the party and its affiliates labor professional and social 
organizations 
tass said 18 of those 750 seats remain to be filled they 
include 12 seats from the academy of sciences where scientists 
rejected most of an old guard list that did not include human 
rights activist andrei d sakharov 
sakharov has been nominated again as a candidate and the academy 
is to decide later this week when a new election will be held 
the final figures indicated that of those elected 171 percent 
were women and 186 percent were workers both figures were lower 
than the composition of the present supreme soviet in which 
authorities have tried to impose quotas

president bush promised tuesday to make active 
use of his veto powers and suggested a minimum wage bill now before 
congress may be the first candidate 
let the congress not misunderstand my determination bush 
told a business group he insisted he would not budge from his 
proposal for raising the current 335 hourly minimum wage to 
425 with a 60day subminimum training wage for youths 
ive got to hold the line ive got to hold the line on the 
grounds of economics and on the grounds of making people 
understand i was serious about that being the best offer he said 
during a questionandanswer session with members of the american 
business conference 
the house has passed legislation to raise the minimum wage to 
455 by october 1991 with a subminimum wage starting at 335 to 
be paid for 60 days but only for a persons firstever job a 
pending senate bill would raise the minimum wage to 465 in 
january 1992 and currently has no subminimum provision 
bushs measure would raise the minimum wage to 425 by january 
1992 
this is our best shot bush said i respect and recognize 
the positions of members of congress on it but ive got to 
stay with this and im going to stay with this 
the president said he would not shy away from using the veto 
there will be time when we have to say look heres what i 
believe and then rally our one third to defend the presidents 
position it takes a twothirds vote of both chambers to override 
a veto 
on another subject bush who vowed no new taxes both 
during his campaign and as president was asked if he could 
support a valueadded tax on products and services something like 
a national sales tax 
i dont even want to discuss a tax on consumerism bush 
said however he said that given the hypothetical requirement to 
choose between different kinds of taxes a tax on consumption would 
be philosophically preferable to one that would sap job creation 
meanwhile press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush had set up 
a new white house council on business competitiveness and assigned 
vice president dan quayle to head it 
bush had promised to do so in his feb 9 budget speech to 
congress 
members of the council will include attorney general dick 
thornburgh commerce secretary robert mosbacher treasury secretary 
nicholas brady budget director richard darman white house chief 
of staff john sununu and michael boskin chairman of the 
presidents council of economic advisers 
quayle already is chairman of the national space council an 
eisenhowerera body bush has reconstructed to explore and promote 
the nations space program 
as part of its mission to improve us business competitiveness 
the new council will examine among other things government 
regulation and paperwork burdens fitzwater said 
he said however that it would not be a decisionmaking 
body and the panel would instead focus on the larger questions 
that bear on competitiveness 
they will determine their own duration and the nature of their 
work the spokesman said so the vice president will give form 
and substance to this group

syrian and christian gunners traded 
shellfire across beirut before dawn tuesday bombarding the citys 
residential suburbs nonstop for the fourth day 
a us embassy official said two american officers were 
evacuated monday the officers were part of a threeman technical 
team assigned to lebanons defense ministry 
ambassador john mccarthy told reporters after a meeting with 
army commander gen michel aoun that this fighting must stop 
quickly it has caused tremendous damage killed many people 
and brought lebanons economy to its knees 
mccarthy met aoun at the bunker of the battered presidential 
palace in suburban baabda five miles east of beirut 
aoun heads the christian military cabinet in lebanons dual 
government his 20000 mostly christian troops have been fighting 
an alliance of syrian and druse forces in and around beirut for the 
past four weeks 
police said overnight clashes killed six people and wounded 18 
in moslem and christian areas before shelling dwindled to sporadic 
exchanges after daybreak the shelling began saturday 
two more civilians were killed and seven wounded when the 
shelling intensified in the afteroon said a police spokesman who 
cannot be identified under standing rules 
the latest casualties raised the toll to 155 people killed and 
506 wounded since march 8 when the current round of hostilities 
broke out between aouns christian troops and the syrian and druse 
moslem fighters 
also tuesday syrian soldiers allowed a convoy of four tanker 
trucks to cross from north lebanon into the christian hinterland 
northeast of beirut to provide a power station with fuel oil 
mohammed mawlawi manager of the state oil refinery in the 
northern town of tripoli said the tankers would bring 1000 tons 
of fuel oil for the station over the next four days 
a total power failure would be disastrous to the whole of 
lebanon mawlawi said in a broadcast on the moslem voice of the 
nation radio 
supplies were allowed in after the electricity authority warned 
its power station in beiruts christian zouk suburb would run out 
of fuel oil saturday triggering a power failure across most of 
lebanon 
the christian voice of lebanon radio said christian army gunners 
monday set ablaze a syrian army ammunition depot in the mountain 
resort of abadieh east of beirut 
it said the depot contained lethal chemical materials which 
forced the syrian army to evacuate civilians from the abadiyeh 
area the report could not be verified 
despite the relative lull that prevailed over beirut and the 
surrounding mountains from 5 am civilians remained huddled in 
basements and bomb shelters to avoid any sudden escalation of 
hostilities 
a dozen families sheltering in an apartment building basement in 
the christian adonis district dispatched one man to a nearby bakery 
this is the safest way we will send one of us to buy food for 
the whole building every day until a ceasefire is declared and 
accepted by both sides antoine shedyak a mechanical engineer 
said by telephone 
kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah ahmad sabah head of a 
sixman arab league mediation committee was due in damascus on 
tuesday to try to arrange a settlement of the confrontation 
the leftist daily paper assafir which reflects official syrian 
views said sabah would propose a twomonth truce between aoun and 
his opponents to give the arab league committee time to work out a 
solution to lebanons sixmonthold political crisis 
aoun has been insisting that syria be a party to any ceasefire 
accord with his 20000 troops 
the syrians with 40000 troops in predominantly moslem 
terrritories of lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate are the main power brokers in the country 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of failing 
in their mandate by siding with the moslems against the christians 
in the 14yearold civil war 
officially the syrians deny their troops in lebanon are 
involved against aouns forces entrenched in the 310squaremile 
christian enclave northeast of beirut 
the political crisis erupted sept 22 when president amin 
gemayels 6year term expired with parliament failing to elect a 
successor gemayel appointed aoun a maronite catholic like 
himself head of an interim military cabinet to rule pending the 
election of a new president 
syrianbacked moslems rejected aouns appointment because it 
violated a 45yearold tradition of having a sunni moslem premier 
a christian president and a shiite moslem parliament speaker they 
pledged allegiance to acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni who 
governed under gemayel

a senior administration official on tuesday 
praised the senate banking committees savings and loan proposal 
for maintaining tough capital standards but criticized it for 
creating a loophole in the grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
the committee is meeting behind closed doors this week in 
preparation for public billwriting sessions next week on tuesday 
the panel began going over a series of changes to the 
administration plan proposed by the staff of the committee 
chairman sen donald w riegle jr dmich 
according to a committee document obtained by the associated 
press the senate plan would deviate only slightly from the 
administrations requirement that thrift owners invest more of 
their own money or capital to back up the loans they make 
the administration would prevent sampls from expanding after june 
1991 if they do not meet stricter capital standards the senate 
proposal keeps the deadline which sampl lobbyists have been trying 
to push back but would permit some weak sampls to grow modestly even 
if they missed it 
we would applaud the fact that they have resisted watering 
down the capital standards assistant treasury secretary david w 
mullins one of the key architects of the administrations 
proposal said in a telephone interview 
of the proposed capital changes he said i dont see anything 
thats grossly out of line 
however he warned that the senate proposal for raising 50 
billion to close or sell failed sampls fundamentally threatens the 
grammrudman process by setting a precedent that could be used 
again for other spending programs 
the bush administration has put togther a complex mechanism that 
combines taxpayer and industry funds and keeps the 50 billion out 
of the budget deficit by selling bonds through a quasigovernment 
agency 
riegle advocates including the spending in the budget deficit 
and raising the money through the sale of regular treasury bonds a 
method he says would save 45 billion over 30 years because 
treasury bonds carry a lower interest rate riegle would avoid 
grammrudmans automatic spending cuts by raising all of the money 
in the current fiscal year now that the deficit target deadlines 
have passed 
the administration believes its scheme for evading grammrudman 
cant be readily applied to other kinds of programs while the 
riegle plan could be used every year to avoid deficit limits 
mullins also warned that opposition to riegles proposal from 
grammrudman advocates could delay passage of the entire sampl 
package 
groups representing commercial banks are particularly happy with 
senate amendments that would shift more power over sampls to the 
federal deposit insurance corp a commercial bank regulator 
the administration wants to give the fdic control over the sampl 
deposit insurance fund the senate plan would expand the agencys 
power further by giving it control over accounting and capital 
standards for sampls and by making it the primary regulator of 
statechartered sampls that would leave the sampl regulator the 
federal home loan bank system with little power 
edward yingling executive director of government relations for 
the american bankers association said expanding the fdics control 
over sampls would ensure that sampl standards did not become looser 
than bank standards 
kenneth guenther executive vice president of the independent 
bankers of america said he was pleased by the senate change that 
would give the fdic chairman a set term the administration wants 
the president to have the power to dismiss the fdic chairman at 
will 
we think sen riegle has moved very much in the right 
direction in terms of making the fdic board considerly more 
independent of the white house and treasury department we think 
thats a major plus guenther said

a former national security council staffer 
testified tuesday he took much of what oliver north said with 
with four grains of salt and recalled making a pinocchiolike 
nosegrowing gesture whe he read a letter to congress that north 
was drafting 
vincent cannistraro said he felt that north in his efforts to 
help the nicaraguan contras had crossed the line from 
objectivity to advocacy 
although he was called as a defense witness cannistraros 
testimony was peppered with critical references to north who is on 
trial on charges including withholding information from congress in 
connection with the irancontra affair 
cannistraro jousted with prosecutor john keker who tried in 
cross examination to cast doubt on the witness credibility 
suggesting more than once that he had lied 
keker asked whether north formerly a marine lieutenant colonel 
attached to the staff of the nsc had been considered trustworthy 
i had considered colonel north a trustworthy person but there 
were occasions when myself and others had some questions about the 
veracity about some of the things he told us cannistraro said 
keker asked whether he remembered testifying before a grand jury 
that he took things north said with four grains of salt 
maybe three said cannistraro 
keker then read what the witness had told the grand jury 
with colonel north you never could be certain if what he was 
telling was true or fantasy or deliberately meant to mislead my 
practice was to take everything with four grains of salt 
to that reading cannistraro responded it was the way i came 
to feel about him in the summer of 1986 
cannistraro recalled a comment by a cia official that 
whatever ollie was doing he was bound to get us all in a lot of 
trouble and he wanted to stay far away from him 
north lawyer brendan sullivan drew from the witness that he 
admired north for his dedication and his persistence and would 
want him in a foxhole with me when the first rounds were coming 
in 
keker asked about a time when north was drafting answers to 
inquiries by two congressional committees one of the charges 
against north is that he made false statements in those letters 
which were signed by thennational security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane 
he showed you some of his answers keker asked 
i asked him if they were accurate and they did not appear to 
be so said cannistraro 
did you do anything said keker cannistraro balked 
appealing to the judge on whether he had to answer i want to 
know what you did keker continued 
i suggested cannistraro began and the prosecutor put 
his hand to his nose and stretched his arm out as if to show a 
long nose 
not that long said cannistraro and even north at the 
witness table joined in the laughter 
whose nose grew keker asked 
i was trying to convey to colonel north his answer did not 
reflect the facts said cannistraro he said it was out of the 
suggestion of mr mcfarlane and he was not a free agent in the 
matter 
mcfarlane testified earlier in the trial that he was responsible 
for the letters and that north contributed just two innocuous 
paragraphs to one of the letters 
keker also brought out that cannistraro had made no mention in 
his 1987 grand jury appearance of his assertion monday that 
thencia director william casey said president reagan had 
designated north as the man who would assist the contras if 
congress enacted a military aid ban 
you know its easy to blame things on a dead man keker told 
the witness 
yes responded cannistraro 
under questioning from us district judge gerhard a gesell 
cannistraro said that caseys comments were at a different meeting 
from the one he discussed before the grand jury 
cannistraro said that at the time he was being intimidated 
by members of the special prosecuting team and that my agenda was 
to try to be cooperative but avoid going into significant 
detail when not asked 
i did not lie to the grand jury cannistraro said at one 
point 
in rapid succession three more defense witnesses testified 
tuesday afternoon before the jury was sent home until thursday the 
oneday recess was called because of a death in the family of a 
juror 
norman h gardner jr a cia official testified that he had 
the job of drafting testimony that casey was to give on capitol 
hill on nov 21 1986 after the diversion of iran arms sales 
profits to the contras became known 
casey was in a central american country so the cia arranged for 
gardner to be flown in an air force c130 to take him the draft 
the witness said he and an armed guard were alone with the crew on 
the plane which can carry more than 42000 pounds of cargo 
william charles haskell who owns a taxpreparation franchise 
told of being detailed by north to help with getting the land for 
an air strip in costa rica haskell credited north with saving his 
life when both were marine platoon leaders in vietnam 
i saw an opportunity to help this country he said to 
this day i think everything i did and everything ollie did was 
helpful to this country 
gaston sigur who was assistant secretary of state for east 
asian and pacific affairs at the state department in march 1986 
said that at norths request he got north together with 
representatives of taiwan south korea and china north told each 
about the contras needs and eventually taiwan contributed 2 
million

gen colin l powell the former white house 
security adviser said tuesday that despite turmoil in the soviet 
union that countrys armed forces were strong and ready to fight 
powell was installed as head of the us army forces command and 
said his job was to keep 1 million active reserve and national 
guard troops in the united states ready for combat with the hope 
they will never be needed 
the soviets are going through wrenching historic change 
beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system 
is broken and has to be changed powell said at a ceremony at 
fort mcpherson the headquarters of the command which is known as 
forscom 
despite the soviets internal turmoil there is nothing wrong 
with their deployed forces he said their forscom is strong 
we must be strong 
powell said a priority was national guard and reserve units 
which are not as ready as we would like them to be we dont have 
the resources 
powell said he saw a role for the military in the war on drugs 
but cautioned against its use as a police force 
i will not be resistant to finding ways for the military to 
help civilian authorities in defense against a major threat he 
said i think there are opportunities for our men to get good 
training in interdiction 
powell cautioned that even an apparently innovative leader like 
mikhail gorbachev would need time to make major changes in soviet 
life 
it took them 70 years to acknowledge their system is not 
working theyre not going to fix it in one or two years he 
said it is the west that is strong he has to be innovative he 
has to be imaginative 
powell who will be 52 wednesday succeeded gen joseph t 
palastra jr who had the post for three years and was retiring 
powell who served in korea and vietnam became president 
reagans national security adviser in january 1987 
powell said the army was in a higher state of readiness with a 
better quality of soldier than at any time in his 31 years of 
military service 
in the old days he said soldiers would keep a pinball machine 
in a corner of their barracks today theres a computer there

us customs service chase plane 
ronald arthur coxe 42 a commercial pilot from miami set his 
beechcraft travelair on automatic pilot and making his first jump

coast guard petty officer luis diaz 
he said he almost took his head off he was upside down and 
the cables were around his neck when he pulled the cord diaz 
said 
in custody later coxe said a companion he refused to identify 
had bailed out before him 
we dont know anything about a second person said customs 
spokesman michael sheehan 
a coast guard blackhawk helicopter in pursuit of the beechcraft 
saw coxe swing a uturn and bail out over land just north of lake 
josephine sheehan said 
they saw a large object with a parachute leave the plane he 
said adding that agents werent certain at first what went out the 
door at 7500 feet they landed and took coxe into custody 
coxe charged with smuggling marijuana by aircraft was taken 
before a magistrate tuesday and ordered held without bond pending

a coast guard radar plane spotted a small plane flying 
suspiciously low at about 200 feet over the water 150 miles 
southwest of key west on monday afternoon sheehan said the 
helicopter and a coast guard falcon jet took off after it 
three hours after the saga began customs contacted the north 
american air defense command requesting an f16 to shoot down the 
unmanned aircraft 
the f16 from the florida panhandle base tailed the beechcraft 
and was ready to shoot it down had it veered back toward land and 
posed any danger to populated areas said coast guard ltjg john 
katinski 
the plane crashed after narrowly missing a coast guard 
airsurveillance balloon tethered to a ship in the gulf of mexico 
authorities said

danger to the community assistant us attorney william jung 
told us magistrate linnea johnson this man parachuted from a 
plane over a populated area the plane flew around and it was a 
bomb that easily could have landed anywhere 
a passport seized from coxe indicated he had left belize on

the district of columbia council approved an 
emergency antiloitering bill tuesday that would give the citys 
police power to arrest people congregating in designated illegal 
drug zones 
the bill the latest move in the citys attempt to curb 
drugrelated violence allows police to make arrests if those 
gathering in a such a zone refuse to move on when asked to do so 
the mayor has 10 days in which to sign the measure which then 
would be effective for 90 days the police chief would be able to 
designate a place with a history of drug activity over six months 
as an illegal drug zone and to ban congregation in an area of 1000 
square feet for up to 120 hours 
the areas limited to public property such as sidewalks 
streets and publichousing courtyards would be clearly marked by 
signs barriers and police tape the maximum penalty for loitering 
would be 300 or 90 days in jail 
the intent of the bill is to be able to disperse people 
said nadine winter a member of the council 
we recognize that we will have to impede on the rights of 
others in order for us to gain control of our community said 
hr crawford another council member 
he said he feared residents of neighborhoods where drug sales 
are rampant will be subject to arrest whnever they gather outdoors 
these areas are nonairconditioned public housing units when 
it gets hot of course people are going to come outside he said 
council chairman david clarke assured crawford the measure only 
prohibits congregating if police have asked the people to move on

education secretary lauro cavazos on tuesday 
denounced discrimination against prospective asianamerican college 
students and said his department is exploring allegations of 
admission bias at some schools 
our office of civil rights has been examining these charges 
weve been looking at them very closely cavazos said at a senate 
appropriations subcommittee hearing that kind of discrimination 
is reprehensible its illegal we will investigate all 
complaints in these areas and follow up 
cavazos said ocr also is doing compliance reviews based on press 
reports and information from other sources ocr will undertake 
several compliance reviews this year just to look at this very 
issue we dont have to wait for a formal complaint he said he 
did not say which schools would be targeted 
a spokesman later said reviews prompted by questions about 
discriination against asianamericans currently are in progress at 
harvard and the university of california at los angeles 
concern over admission policies biased against asianamericans 
was raised by sen tom harkin diowa chairman of the 
appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and 
education 
harkin cited a yale law journal article that discussed problems 
at brown university ocr complaints against the university of 
california at berkeley and a california auditorgenerals report 
questioning berkeley admission policies he asked cavazos whether 
his department would be interested in starting a compliance review 
at berkeley 
a cavazos aide deputy undersecretary charles kolb told him it 
would be up to ocr to follow up 
later ocr spokesman gary curran said ocr had received four 
individual complaints in the last two years about berkeley one of 
which is still pending he said no compliance review has been 
undertaken because the university is involved in a 
selfevaluation 
curran cited the auditorgeneral report as well as a recent 
faculty report noting asians may be at a disadvantage in gaining 
admission to the school we are waiting to see what sort of 
action they take in response to the reports he said 
officials at berkeley acknowledge that the law school has kept 
separate waiting lists for asians blacks hispanics and native 
americans for a dozen years they say the multiple lists are a way 
for minorities to gain representation in the incoming class 
cavazos told harkin that as a former college president i know 
that it is important to have a diverse student body i certainly 
favor greater opportunity for minority students but discrimination 
against students merely because they are asianamerican is illegal 
and unacceptable

congress should require 90 percent reductions 
in air pollution by nitrogen compounds given off in power plant 
emissions and motor vehicle exhausts the american lung association 
said tuesday 
nitrogen oxides help form ozone acid rain and the formation of 
airborne particles that hamper visibility 
some of nitrogen oxide compounds also contribute to the global 
warming embodied in the greenhouse effect theory while others 
may be more damaging to health than previously believed the 
association said 
aggressive control of nitrogen oxides is necessary feasible 
and long overdue said peg garland of the association which 
recommended reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by about 4 million 
metric tons a year from about 20 million metric tons now to do 
that would cost the economy about 3 per person per year she said 
several technologies can reduce emissions catalytic devices 
used in west germany and japan are achieving 90 percent reductions 
nitrogen oxides which result from any combustion have long 
been recognized as important pollutants in recent years however 
congressional attention has been largely focused on sulfur 
compounds which also form acid rain on epa policies for dealing 
with the failure of many cities to meet ozone standards and on 
emissions of industrial chemicals 
about half of all nitrogen oxides come from industrial fuel 
combustion mostly in power plants while 40 percent come from 
motor vehicle exhausts according to estimates by the environmental 
protection agency 
if nothing is done power plant emissions are expected to double 
in 30 years and total emissions to increase by 50 percent the 
association said 
new power plants must meet strict emissions limits with coal 
plants achieving a 65 percent reduction from what their emissions 
would otherwise be there are no standards for plants built before 
1971 however 
the association said that new plants should be forced to reduce 
emissions by 90 percent and old plants should be required to 
install control equipment achieving 80 percent to 90 percent 
reductions over the next decade 
current federal standards for auto exhausts in all states but 
california result in about a 75 percent reduction in emissions from 
an uncontrolled car california which has tougher standards of its 
own is tightening its standards to achieve a 90 percent reduction 
by the 1991 model year 
the association said that congress in its debates this year on 
revising the clean air act should extend the new california auto 
standard to the rest of the country 
almost 100 cities fail to meet federal ozone standards and john 
holmes chief researcher for the california air resources board 
said the epas strategies for fighting ozone have lost 
effectiveness by neglecting nitrogen oxides 
for sustained ozone formation both nitrogen oxides and 
hydrocarbon vapors like unburned gasoline are necessary in some 
areas reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone so the epa 
has stressed to states and cities that they should reduce 
hydrocarbon emissions 
john bachmann an epa environmental engineer said he believed 
the agencys concerns were converging with holmes 
if the numbers are high enough theres no question hes 
right bachmann said 
bruce jordan of the office said the agency was requiring states 
to consider nitrogen oxide reductions in revising their air 
pollution control plans 
speaking for himself and not the agency bachman said a 
requirement for a 90 percent emissions reduction in all cases would 
be technically premature 
the agencys spokesman on air issues did not immediately return 
a phone call

fire ant stings send at least 21000 people a 
year to doctors in 13 southern states a survey has found 
the survey of physicians for the american academy of allergy and 
immunology also found that 413 people were treated for 
lifethreatening reactions to fire ant stings last year and that 32 
died most of them because they were hypersensitive to the ants 
poison 
in most of those who died the ant stings triggered an 
anaphylactic or allergic response which caused the bodys 
respiratory system to shut down 
people and physicians should take these stings seriously 
said robert rhoades a pediatrician at the medical college of 
georgia 
people who are allergic to other kinds of insect stings should 
be especially cautious said rhoades who heads a special panel 
that monitors medical problems caused by fire ants 
fire ants arrived in florida by boat from south america and have 
been slowly moving northward and westward cold weather has 
seemingly confined them to the deep south 
but recent studies have shown the ant is crossbreeding and that 
the hybrid which can withstand lower temperatures may push its 
range farther north into the north georgia mountains and tennessee 
more than 2000 physicians in 13 states or about 10 percent of 
those polled responded to the allergy academy survey indicating 
they treat about 21000 patients a year for fire ant stings most 
of those stung were treated successfully with overthecounter 
antihistamines

the governments of the greek and turkish 
cypriot communities have agreed to withdraw their soldiers from 
three tense observation points on the green line in nicosia 
officials said tuesday 
rauf denktash president of the breakaway turkish republic of 
northern cyprus confirmed in an interview that his government had 
fully agreed with the un plan for the pullback 
the agreement in principle marks the first time the cypriot 
government and the administration of the turkish republic have ever 
concluded a military withdrawal agreement said officials from both 
communities 
greek cypriot troops are only 10 yards from turkish cypriot 
troops at some points in nicosia 
in 1988 a turkish cypriot and a greek cypriot were killed in 
separate sniping attacks across the green line as the unofficial 
buffer zone dividing the two ethnic communities is known 
under the terms of the un plan both the greek and turkish 
cypriot forces will withdraw from the posts but will not 
necessarily have to dismantle their defense works said a turkish 
cypriot official speaking on condition of anonymity 
cypriot defense minister andreas aloneftis said his government 
has agreed to the un plan both sides still have to sign formal 
documents with the united nations 
if the plan succeeds denktash said it would naturally lead 
to further steps toward demilitarization provided the un is 
between us our armed people must not see each other from different 
points 
the un peacekeeping force in cyprus known as unficyp was 
established in 1964 since 1974 it has patrolled the green line in 
an attempt to defuse hostilities it has about 2100 troops and 34 
police monitors from nine nations 
denktash and cypriot president george vassiliou are in new york 
for a third round of talks mediated by secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar on how to reconcile the greek and turkish 
communities on cyprus 
denktash said tuesday he has little hope the talks will result 
in progress toward reunifying the divided island 
the east mediterranean island has been unofficially partitioned 
since the greek government fomented a coup and turkish troops moved 
into the northern sector in 1974 to protect the turkish minority 
community 
the coup failed but about 30000 turkish troops remain and 
about 50000 turks moved from the mainland to settle in northern 
cyprus 
vassilious government demands the removal of the turkish troops 
and settlers as part of the process of establishing a national 
republic with two states with virtual autonomy in local affairs 
dentashs turkish cypriot community declared itself a nation in 
1983 but has only been recognized by turkey 
the turkish republic covers about 37 percent of northern cyprus 
and has 120000 residents mostly moslems they form about 18 
percent of the entire population of the island

five alaskan sea otters rescued from the 
oilstained waters of alaskas prince william sound were brought to 
sea world where park employees worked tuesday to help them recover 
the otters were cleaned of oil at an animal rescue center in the 
alaskan port of valdez but they need additional care and 
rehabilitation said jim antrim a sea world vice president and the 
parks general curator 
the sea mammals are among the victims of the nations worst oil 
spill which occurred march 24 when an exxon tanker ran aground on 
a reef ten million gallons of oil spilled into the sound 
antrim said four of the otters were basically in stable 
condition while the prognosis is very guarded for the fifth 
its got a lower body temperature and its not eating on its 
own antrim said it appears to be a bit dehydrated 
the otters arrived at sea world late monday night they were 
flown from alaska to los angeles in a cargo plane and then taken by 
truck to san diego federal wildlife officials asked the park to 
take in the otters 
though the animals have been scrubbed they still are threatened 
when the animls have been fouled with oil and cleaned theyve 
lost their natural insulation antrim said so they have to be 
cared for and fed and observed for a period of time until their 
natural body oils can make them waterproof again 
it will take a minimum of four to six weeks before the otters 
can rebuild the natural insulation vital for survival in the frigid 
ocean they also may have poisoned themselves by ingesting oil 
while preening 
sea world plans to release the otters into the wild upon their 
recovery but they might not be returned to prince william sound

the hatfield town clock can keep on 
chiming at night despite a couples lawsuit charging that it keeps 
them awake a judge ruled 
superior court judge john f murphy jr said in rejecting a 
request for a temporary injunction monday that silencing the clock 
until trial will not best serve the publics interest the 
judge also said richard and pamela carnall failed to show they 
would suffer irreparable harm if the clock was allowed to continue 
to toll the hours 
the carnalls who moved to the little farming community of 3200 
people last summer when the 200yearold clock was not working 
sued last month after selectmen declined to shut off the clock at 
night 
the couple contends the clock located in the steeple of the 
first congregational church about 50 feet from their home booms 
the hours at 75 decibels 15 decibels louder than a vacuum cleaner 
and 25 decibels above the level the federal aviation administration 
has set as the loudest people can sleep through 
murphy said in his decision that expert testimony would be 
required at trial to determine decibel levels as well as the 
mechanical feasibility of installing a timer to shut off the chimes 
late at night 
the carnalls were away from home and could not be reached for 
comment tuesday but their attorney w michael ryan said he would 
seek to bring the case to trial as quickly as possible 
most people are sympathetic to the carnalls even people who 
want the bell to keep ringing ryan contended

chemical agents such as those applied in 
response to the vast oil spill in alaskas prince william sound are 
of limited value in major spills but can be effective in dispersing 
smaller slicks according to a study published tuesday 
the study by a national research council panel of academic and 
industry experts said use of dispersants generally is helpful in 
ocean spills but more biological studies are needed to determine 
how coastal habitats are affected by the chemicals 
the research council is an independent adviser to the government 
on scientific issues its study was conducted before last months 
spill of 10 million gallons of crude oil from the exxon valdez the 
largest in us history 
dispersants are most effective when applied to oil within the 
first five hours after a spill the study said adding that a day 
or two of evaporation and weathering cause spilled oil to become 
too thick to disperse with chemicals 
exxons application of a dispersant called corexit was delayed 
for more than a day first because the water was too cold and calm 
then because strong winds that created a better environment for the 
dispersants hampered the aircraft used to spread the chemicals 
applying dispersants quickly is especially important because 
effective alternatives do not exist for treating ocean oil 
spills the council report said 
dispersants usually are made of thick liquid detergent that is 
mixed with a solvent that thins the detergent and makes it easier 
to apply the molecules of the dispersant attach themselves to the 
oil reducing the surface tension between the oil and the water 
this makes it easier for the oil to dissolve in the water 
the report quoted james n butler of harvard university 
chairman of the experts panel as saying the mandate is clear to 
use chemical dispersants when oil must be dispersed before it 
reaches shore 
once oil enters coastal habitats the decision to use chemicals 
is more difficult the study said since fish and shellfish can be 
harmed 
for years chemical dispersants have been suspected by some of 
causing more environmental harm than good the research council 
report said experts who studied a 1967 oil spill off britain in 
which thousands of tons of dispersants were used concluded that the 
chemicals contributed to the deaths of local animals and plants

israeli officials said they will release 
hundreds of palestinian prisoners on wednesday and ease 
restrictions in the occupied west bank and gaza strip for the 
moslem holy month of ramadan 
the announcement on tuesday came on the eve of prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs visit to washington 
an army official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed 
an israel television report that the detainees will be released 
wednesday but did not elaborate israel tv said it was a goodwill 
gesture before ramadan which begins friday

wounded tuesday in clashes between soldiers and stonethrowing 
palestinian protesters 
in tel aviv dozens of reserve soldiers and officers 
demonstrated in front of the defense ministry demanding that 
israel end military government in the occupied lands and that talks 
between israel and palestinians begin at once 
i did 72 days of reserve duty this year most of them in a 
battle against the children of the territories one officer told 
the rally participants told israel tv the rally was not political 
and they would not refuse service in the territories 
security forces meanwhile arrested members of a guerrilla cell 
organized by the fatah faction of plo chief yasser arafat the army 
announced 
it said the members residents of the west bank village of 
hajja were responsible for 16 attacks that wounded 13 israeli and 
palestinian civilians in 198687

ramot head of the military government in the gaza strip said that 
during ramadan the government will reopen some closed mosques and 
schools according to journalists who attended the meeting 
he said hundreds of prisoners will be freed but did not give a 
specific number more than 10000 held in connection with the 
palestinian revolt 
i gave orders and instructions to the army to keep away from 
schools and mosques because i know how sensitive ramadan is for 
moslems and we have no intention of killing or wounding anyone in 
the strip ramot told the journalists 
the journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity said ramot 
made clear he still believed mosques and schools were centers of 
incitement for the uprising

the violence in the occupied territories where the revolt against 
israeli occupation has led to the deaths of 419 palestinians 
eighteeen israelis also have been killed 
ramadan the most important holiday for moslems marks the 
period when the prophet mohammed began receiving the koran or 
moslem holy book from god 
one of islams five pillars or guiding principles is that 
every moslem must fast from sunrise to sunset during the entire 
month 
it is also a month of religious fervor when confrontations with 
soldiers could boil over into violence more than 80 percent of the

program or arp for the 1990 crop the idling requirement for 1989 
was 10 percent of a farmers wheat acreage base 
the department said a decision will be announced no later than 
june 1 by law if the us stockpile of wheat is estimated to be 
less than one billion bushels at the end of the current marketing 
year on may 31 the following years arp cannot exceed 20 percent 
department analysts are currently forecasting the wheat 
stockpile left over at the end of this marketing year at 534 
million bushels

the next cactus you see some night along the 
usmexico border in texas just might be a national guardsman 
gathering intelligence information on drug trafficking 
national guard troops will try to infiltrate areas of suspected 
drug smuggling along the border and relay intelligence to federal 
authorities under a 29 million program to fight narcotics 
trafficking in texas sen phil gramm said tuesday 
the texas republican said the guard is not disclosing many 
details of the planned foot patrols part of a drugtrafficking 
package of actions including aerial surveillance and helping the 
us customs service with search and seizure of cargo crossing the 
border 
a congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the texas guard troops would use camouflage paint to look like a 
cactus bush and then infiltrate along the border under cover of 
darkness 
the 29 million was approved last week by defense secretary 
dick cheney who also authorized plans involving guardsmen in other 
states 
gramm said a socalled longrange reconnaissance patrol 
program is a new program the national guard is not talking 
about 
however he said it involves troops who will provide additional 
assistance to federal agencies in a running war with 
drugsmugglers along our border 
the american people clearly want the military more involved in 
our war on drugs gramm said in an interview it is a great 
step to enhance our ability to interdict drugs coming into our 
country 
but lt col ed komandosky spokesman for the national guard in 
texas said he was not aware of any such foot or air patrols under 
the 29 million effort 
the only money weve been allocated by the department of 
defense for drug interdiction is to run a cooperative program with 
the customs service komandosky said 
under that plan some 90 to 100 volunteer parttime guardsmen 
would be sent beginning thursday to four border points of entry and 
the port of houston to assist customs inspectors searching for 
illegal drug shipments 
komandosky said he was positive the money would not be 
financing the air or ground patrols unless gramm knows something 
i dont know and thats entirely possible that im not aware of 
any such animal

mayor marion barry jr was sharply questioned 
tuesday by a senate panel over his failure to provide specific 
plans to curb the record homicide rate in the nations capital 
we are here in the capacity of private citizens outraged 
private citizens as well as public officials sen wyche 
fowler dga told barry at a hearing on the crime problem held by 
the senate district of columbia appropriations subcommittee 
in all this testimony we have not had a single request saying 
we have a war on our hands and we need your help fowler 
said 
mr mayor i think youre hearing something fundamental 
hereask us for the help and specify what we are to do said 
subcommittee chairman brock adams dwash weve got to take the 
streets back 
the hearing was held as washingtons drugrelated murder spree 
continued to place the district in the international limelight 
through tuesday 128 people had been killed in the district 
compared with 83 at the same point last year a record 372 were 
killed in the district last year and police blame 60 percent of 
those killings on drugs 
adams said he would recommend that more federal money be used to 
hire additional city police officers but only once barry provided 
him more details on current police antidrug efforts jail crowding 
problems and antidrug efforts 
we want to provide the funding but we need a basis on which 
to proceed adams said 
give us a couple of says and we can give you a good 
shortterm list barry told the senate panel this government 
has no problem asking for help and i hope i didnt give that 
impression 
barry repeatedly stressed that he held back on giving the senate 
panel details because he wanted to allow bush administration drug 
policy coordinator william j bennett to review a 102 million 
proposal barry had sent him monday 
during the hearing the mayor agreed to make public his bennett 
proposal but that move did not satisfy all on the panel 
sen robert kerrey dneb who described barrys written 
testimony as a chamber of commerce document accused the mayor 
of glossing over the citys problems 
if i were to judge you on the job youre doing with drugs and 
i were given a vote i wouldnt vote for you kerrey said 
angrily in the absence of a community committed to solving the 
problem no amount of money would help 
barry told kerrey that his oral remarks which kerry missed 
because he was at another hearing went to the heart of the citys 
drug crisis barry later acknowledged making a tactical error 
by not sharing with the subcommittee the plan he sent to bennett 
an aide to bennett said the bush administration probably will 
not provide all of the 102 million aid package the mayor has 
requested most of the money would be used to house district 
prisoners in federal jails and for the hiring of 700 additional 
police officers 
its hard to see how we could recommend an additional 100 
million a year for the district said bennett spokesman don 
hamilton 
bennetts office has not yet come up with its own total i 
dont have a ballpark dollar figure at all hamilton said 
stressing that his office had had the barry plan less than 24 
hours hamilton said it will be reviewed to see how it might 
agree with plans being developed by bennetts staff 
its clear that we agree on some of the things such as the 
need for more prison space he said 
the comments of adams fowler and others indicate growing 
congressional concern about the district governments ability to 
slow the record murder rate in the nations capital 
two weeks ago sen warren rudman rnh raised the 
possibility of a federal takeover of the police department rep 
stan parris rva is drafting legislation in the house that would 
do just that 
an aide to parris said his bill would be introduced by next week

the ira said it shot and 
wounded a parttime police officer after one of its members was 
killed in bed on tuesday while his 3monthold daughter slept in a 
crib beside him 
ira member gerard casey 29 a father of four children was the 
26th victim of sectarian strife to die in northern ireland this 
year and the 2737th to die in nearly 20 years of religious 
violence in the british province 
casey was shot by two men who stormed his home in balleymoney 
40 miles northwest of belfast police said protestant 
paramilitaries were responsible for the attack the ira in 
messages to belfast media said casey was a member of its north 
antrim brigade 
later tuesday a parttime police officer who had stopped his 
car at a pedestrian crossing in west belfast was shot and wounded 
by men firing from the sidewalk police said the ira said it 
carried out the attack 
the police officer who was not identified was in stable 
condition with wounds to his back police said 
in a third incident police said security forces found and 
defused a bomb in a belfast house after a twoday search after the 
ira said it had abandoned a bomb in the area 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in the 
province and unite it with the overwhelmingly catholic irish 
republic most protestants want northern ireland to remain under 
the british flag 
in another development tuesday a court heard how the last 
moments in the lives of two british soldiers slain by the ira at a 
funeral in west belfast were filmed by an army helicopter hovering 
helplessly above 
henry maguire 29 and alexander murphy 31 pleaded innocent to 
the murders on the first day of their trial at belfast crown court 
which is expected to last six weeks 
twentyseven more people three of them accused of murder have 
been charged in the case and will be tried later 
prosecutor ronald appleton said the helicopter crew saw 
corporals derek wood 24 and david howes 23 drive into the 
funeral procession for a slain member of the ira 
he said their car was surrounded and the two soldiers dragged 
out beaten kicked stripped almost naked driven in a black taxi 
to an empty lot and thrown over a 9foot wall 
a man seen getting a gun nearby returned to the soldiers and 
stretched out his arm in a firing position first over one and then 
the other appleton said afterwards the crowd dispersed 
he said wood was later found to have been shot six times and 
stabbed four times howes was shot five times 
appleton said maguire and murphy had bloodstains on their 
clothes of the same types as the two soldiers when they were 
arrested in a taxi near the spot where the soldiers car was 
stopped 
the helicopter had been monitoring the funeral procession on 
march 19 last year of ira member kevin brady

portauprince haiti ap the government bowed to pressure 
from mutinous soldiers and said tuesday it released from jail and 
deported three army officers who tried to overthrow haitian leader 
lt gen prosper avril 
rebels surrendered control of the international airport which 
reopened tuesday for the first time since sundays coup attempt 
the us embassy said there no longer appeared to be any active 
resistance in the army to the government 
i think theres no doubt that president avril is completely in 
control now said embassy spokeswoman susan clyde there are no 
signs of a continuation of the coup attempt against him 
a government communique identified the three alleged coup 
conspirators as lt col himmler rebu commander of the leopards 
battalion col phillipe biamby commander of the presidential 
guard and col leonce qualo an administrative officer at army 
headquarters 
the government accused rebu biamby and qualo of a foolhardy 
attempt to overthrow the government but said avril had 
magnanimously decided to free them from arrest on humanitarian 
grounds 
the communique read on staterun tv said the three were given 
safe passage to the united states and were driven monday night to 
the dominican republic border for a flight out rebu was 
accompanied by his wife and four children 
independent radio haiti inter said tuesday the leopard battalion 
had accepted their new commander col lionel claude a strong 
indication the insurgency had ended 
in santo domingo foreign ministry sources said the haitians 
crossed the border at dawn it was not known how long they would 
remain in the country before flying to the united states 
release of the coup leaders was seen mainly as an attempt to 
appease soldiers of the elite 300man leopard battalion who were 
demanding freedom for rebu their commander 
at least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were killed 
monday in skirmishes with troops loyal to avril the rebels briefly 
seized control of national television station monday before being 
evicted by the presidential guard and held the airport until late 
monday night 
the airport was reopened tuesday but all commercial flights 
into the country had been canceled earlier 
schools remained closed but most stores in portauprince the 
capital were opened by midday tuesday and traffic was picking up 
steadily 
avril who assumed power six months ago in a coup led by 
noncommissioned officers demanding democratic reforms narrowly 
escaped the attempt to topple his government loyal troops rescued 
him sunday as he was being led to the airport to be deported to the 
dominican republic 
motives for the coup attempt remained unclear and it was not 
known whether rebu biamby and qualo were the only officers 
involved 
the staterun daily newspaper lunion said tuesday that rebu was 
the main ringleader and said he and the other conspirators 
were arrested and held under military guard at the national palace 
there was speculation the coup attempt was prompted by fears 
that a crackdown by avril on illegal drugs within the army might 
lead to widespread dismissals of officers suspected of corruption 
avril last week dismissed four highranking army officers accused 
of drug trafficking 
in washington on tuesday the state department denied giving the 
haitian government a list of officers it wanted cashiered from the 
army because of alleged involvement in drug trafficking 
no we did not state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said when asked about the suggestion that the us demand 
led to the attempted coup 
she said richard melton a department envoy had visited haiti 
and discussed with avril the broad range of us interests in 
haiti which would include narcotic cooperation along with 
democratic reforms respect for human rights and credible 
development programs 
we did not deliver any list of names nor did we give any kind

south africa said tuesday the 
4dayold independence process in namibia is in danger of 
collapsing because of fierce fighting between security forces and 
black nationalist guerrillas 
foreign affairs minister pik botha wrote un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cueller on tuesday that south africa was 
considering suspending the implementation of independence in the 
territory 
unless active and effective measures are taken within the next 
few hours to stem the rapid deterioration of the situation the 
whole peace process in namibia is in danger of collapse said his 
letter released in south africa 
at least 169 guerrillas 19 police and one south african soldier 
have been killed since saturday in clashes across namibias 
northern border with angola according to police and military 
officials 
south africa accused sam nujoma leader of the southwest africa 
peoples organization of sending 1200 swapo guerrillas from 
southern angola into northern namibia in a deliberate attempt to 
sabotage the peace process 
a un investigation found the guerrillas had launched a major 
incursion from angola in violation of the peace plan according 
to diplomats in new york who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the united states on tuesday urged swapo guerrillas to pull back 
into angola and allow the namibian independence process to get 
under way 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said washington 
does not think the agreement was in danger of unraveling at this 
point 
british prime minister margaret thatcher also condemned what she 
called a rebel incursion into namibia and said the incursion caused 
the fighting 
botha wrote the south african government cannot be expected 
to implement its undertakings while swapo continues to act in 
flagrant violation of the provisions approved by the united 
nations 
under the un plan all swapo guerrillas are to remain at their 
bases in angola at least 100 miles north of namibias border until 
midmay 
botha said 4450 swapo fighters now are south of that line he 
also said hundreds of cuban troops in angola in tandem with swapo 
fighters had moved to within 650 yards of the namibian border 
in such circumstances south africa has the undoubted right to 
suspend its compliance with its obligations bothas letter added 
fighting broke out saturday the day the united nations began 
supervising a yearlong independence plan for the territory that 
south africa has controlled for 74 years 
south african military officials say the fighting is the 
heaviest since the 1966 start of the bush war against swapo 
south african broadcasting corp television showed bodies of 
more than a dozen guerrillas killed in one clash journalists 
toured northern namibia and saw evidence of heavy fighting but 
casualty figures could not be independently confirmed 
nujoma and other swapo officials say the guerrillas were in 
namibia for some time and that south africanled forces initiated 
the fighting 
our people have been fighting inside namibia in the past 20 
years nujoma told reporters after meeting in harare zimbabwe 
with representatives from the the five permanent member nations of 
the un security council the united states britain france 
china and the soviet union 
nujoma said he planned to end two decades of exile and return to 
namibia very soon he asked the united nations to bolster its 
ceasefire monitoring forces in northern namibia 
the united nations authorized 4650 troops for the namibia 
operation but only about 1000 have arrived and no more than 300 
are in northern namibia the un forces made no effort to 
intervene in the fighting and say it is not part of their mandate 
perez de cuellar said monday in new york the fighting did not 
mean un peacekeeping efforts had broken down 
the uns special representative to namibia martti ahtisaari 
traveled tuesday from the capital of windhoek to the war zone 
the namibian territorial police force composed mostly of black 
namibians commanded by white south africans has done most of the 
fighting against the guerrillas the makeup of the territorial army 
is similar the south african army units in namibia are virtually 
allwhite 
about 1500 south african and namibian soldiers belonging to 
the territorial army and the south african army were given un 
permission to leave their bases and support the police 
our people are being butchered under the united nations 
flag swapo foreign secretary theoben gurirab said tuesday in 
new york 
south africa has ruled namibia also known as southwest africa 
since world war i when it took control of the former german colony 
the way for namibian independence was cleared in december when 
south africa angola and cuba signed a peace accord that calls for 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops supporting marxist angola 
besides granting namibia independence south africa is to end 
military aid to rightwing rebels in angola 
under the un plan elections are to be held in namibia in 
november leading to independence early next year

tranquilized caribou were loaded onto 
a van tuesday and carried north toward their new home in the 
wilderness under a plan to restore the reindeerlike animal in 
maine 
six to eight caribou some weighing as much as 250 pounds were 
to be taken to baxter state park a 200000acre wilderness 
preserve 
after being shot with tranquilizer guns the ungainly creatures 
were lifted on canvas stretchers and carried onto a van for the 
70mile journey blindfolded to reduce stress they were placed 
side by side on a bed of straw 
scientists hope the animals will use their new home as a 
breeding ground 
maines onceabundant caribou were wiped out in maine by 
overhunting and disease the last native woodland caribou to be 
seen in maine was spotted in 1908 on milehigh mount katahdin in 
the parks southern end 
dr ladd heldenbrand a veterinarian monitoring the animals was 
optimistic about the animals chances of flourishing in the wild 
the biggest threats to the caribou are parasites and predators 
heldenbrand said 
we hope the public is educated enough to leave them alone 
he said theyre the publics animals we hope they will respect 
them

honduras on tuesday accused 
nicaragua of trying to use a regional peace effort to get rid of 
the contra rebels without giving up anything in return 
foreign minister carlos lopez contreras told a news conference 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government refuses to talk to the 
usbacked rebels 
nicaragua doesnt want to solve the political and social 
crisis in central america contreras charged it just wants 
a bilateral accord with honduras to fix the problem of the 
contras 
between 10000 and 11000 contra fighters and their families 
began moving into honduran base camps near the border with 
nicaragua last spring after us military aid ended and a 
ceasefire began 
nicaragua which announced another of its monthly unilateral 
extensions of the ceasefire tuesday had no immediate comment on 
the honduran charges 
lopez contreras said nicaragua should offer internal political 
conditions that permit the quick return of the contras their 
families and more than 40000 nicaraguan refugees that have been in 
honduras since 1981 
honduras wants the contras to return to nicaragua as quickly 
as possible but this is the responsibility of the sandinistas who 
absolutely refuse to talk with the contras he said 
in february the presidents of nicaragua honduras guatemala 
el salvador and costa rica agreed to come up with a plan by midmay 
for disarming the rebels and for their voluntary repatriation or 
relocation nicaragua also agreed to hold free elections next year 
the accord has bogged down over the timing of the repatriation 
in relation to the elections nicaragua which scheduled elections 
for february 1990 wants the rebel force dismantled quickly 
lopez contreras said the outlook for regional peace is very 
gray and appears stalled the signs are not good the problem of 
the contras has not been resolved 
in washington costa rican president oscar arias acknowledged 
intense arguments over timing and said the contras should return at 
the same time as the sandinistas make democratic reforms 
you cannot persuade the contras to go back to nicaragua if 
you have nothing for them there he told reporters after a 
meeting with president bush 
lopez contreras said the sandinistas stubbornly refuse to 
talk with the contras 
he and his central american counterparts ended a twoday meeting 
last week without agreeing on demobilization of the contras they 
also postponed the next summit from may 15 the deadline for coming 
up with a plan to dismantle the contras to june 15 
lopez contreras said implementing the presidential accord will 
be difficult unless the sandinistas agree to talk directly or 
indirectly to the rebels 
lamentably the problem has negative repercussions for the 
entire region he said we hope the sandinistas might meditate 
on the future of central america and change their attitude

the federal commission that recommended 
shutting down 86 military bases and partly closing five more was 
optimistic in its assessment that the move will save 56 billion 
over 20 years a congressional budget official said tuesday 
the commissions estimates of savings fell at the upper end of 
the range suggested by our data robert f hale assistant 
director at the congressional budget office told a senate 
subcommittee unfortunately missing historical data and 
differences in definitions make comparisons of onetime costs and 
savings unclear 
the commission did not include the cost of federal economic 
assistance in estimating the plans savings but did include the 
expected revenues from sale of the land presently used by the 
bases hale said 
however the offices analysis found that of the 33 bases closed 
during the 1970s the government only got 35 percent of the 
fairmarket value for sale of the land in some cases the property 
was donated for educational use and other public services 
the commission estimated savings of 694 million a year with 
20year savings estimated at 56 billion 
based on the historic data they were optimistic not 
wildly so hale told the senate appropriations subcommittees on 
defense and military construction 
lawmakers expressed concerns about the commissions 
recommendations at two separate senate hearings while acknowledging 
the plan will likely go into effect next month and base closings 
will begin in 1990 
congress can block the proposal which former defense secretary 
frank carlucci approved in january but the chances are unlikely 
the house armed services panel voted 434 last month to support the 
commissions recommendations to close 86 facilities partially 
close five others and change the mission in 54 other installations 
the full house is expected to follow suit later this month 
nevertheless legislators held hearings to question the planned 
closing of some of their local bases 
at the senate armed services subcommittee on readiness 
sustainability and support chairman alan dixon dill cited 
recently unclassified transcripts of the commissions meetings in 
which members discussed time constraints that prohibited a more 
extensive examination of available data on each base 
dixon argued against the planned closing of chanute air force 
base near champaign ill and railed against the rating system 
the commission used to make its decision 
who was the mother father or brainchild of the rating 
system dixon asked 
a lot of people on the commission staff responded dr 
hayden g bryan executive director of the commission staff 
seated behind bryan were 10 members of his staff and dixon 
called on each one to stand and give their name the illinois 
senator also asked the staff members to write down their names and 
addresses 
the commission gave responsibility to faceless people dixon 
said 
in defense of the commissions decision bryan noted the base 
closing was recommended by the defense department chartered by 
congress

more than 200 justice department attorneys 
submitted a petition tuesday to attorney general dick thornburgh 
criticizing the departments attempt to persuade the supreme court 
to overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
we believe that every woman has the right to make her own 
decision about whether or not to continue her pregnancy in 
accordance with the guidelines set forth in roe vs wade the 
petition said referring to the 1973 case we oppose any 
governmental interference with this basic right 
the petition bearing 248 names most of them attorneys was 
given to thornburghs office late in the afternoon according to 
one of the signers 
dave runkel a top aide to thornburgh said the petition wont 
have any impact on the departments position 
these people come in six months after the decision was made to 
appeal this case to the supreme court he said its not 
timely if they wanted to have an impact on what the department 
was doing on this theyre six months too late 
one of the signers an attorney who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity said the petition was submitted late because attorneys 
at the department are very busy and it took a long time to get the 
organization in motion in addition she said the signers hope the 
petition will make an impact on other cases 
she said thornburgh and the department had involved themselves 
in partisan politics by intervening in the case 
runkel said he didnt expect any retaliation against the people 
who signed the petition saying the attorney general understands 
this is a controversial issue that people disagree on 
i dont anticipate any impact unless people decide that 
they so disagree that they can no longer work here he said 
the case before the supreme court is called webster vs 
reproductive health services and it concerns a missouri law that 
prohibits the use of public funds or public employees from 
encouraging or performing or assisting an abortion the 
8th us circuit court of appeals rejected key portions of the law 
last july 13 
the supreme court could act on the webster case without touching 
the 1973 roe vs wade decision but the justice department in a 
brief filed in february urged the court to overturn its earlier 
ruling and leave decisions on abortions to legislators 
the signer who commented on the petition said the majority of 
those who signed are women 
she said the many female attorneys at justice give the issue 
relevance serving as reminders that their ability to pursue 
careers would be compromised by unwanted pregnancies 
colleen oconnor of the american civil liberties union praised 
the employees who signed the petition 
quite apart from the issue of what the department is doing on 
roe vs wade its heartening to know there are a few government 
lawyers willing to exercise their first amendment rights she 
said 
the attorney general obviously can respond any way he wants to 
that petition but he of all people has to know that his employees 
should not bear any recriminations for expressing their views on an 
issue as important as this one oconnor said

eighteen months after it was convicted of 
selling bogus apple juice to consumers the beechnut corp has 
been debarred from doing any business with the federal government 
through 1991 
the corporation suspended from federal contracting since 
december 1986 is now being debarred to protect the governments 
interest in doing business only with contractors who conduct 
business with honesty and integrity the pentagons order states 
the debarment which beechnut contested was announced tuesday 
by the defense logistics agency the company was advised of the 
decision in a letter dated march 3 the pentagon added 
a suspension is normally the first step toward a company either 
being debarred or allowed to resume bidding on government work a 
contract debarment is the harshest administrative sanction the 
pentagon can impose on a contractor 
such an order whose term can vary prevents a company from 
bidding on or receiving any new contract from any agency of the 
federal government not just the defense department 
in beechnuts case the pentagon announced in january it was 
changing the suspension of the beechnut nutrition corp a wholly 
owned subsidiary to a debarment by taking the same action tuesday 
against the parent beechnut corp the pentagon has barred any and 
all units of the corporation from receiving any government contract 
through dec 4 1991 
the beechnut nutrition corp was convicted nov 13 1987 in 
federal court in new york on a total of 215 counts involving 
charges of introducing adulterated food into commerce and violating 
the federal food drug and cosmetic act 
the criminal conduct of beechnut nutrition involved 
manufacturing juice for babies which was labeled as and represented 
to be pure apple juice but in fact contained little if any apple 
or fruit juice the pentagon noted in its order 
the financial impact of tuesdays action on the company appears 
slight the defense logistics agency purchases beechnut products 
for resale in military commissaries around the world 
larry wilson a dla spokesman said he could not immediately 
estimate the value of the governments business to the company 
before it was suspended in 1986 other pentagon officials said 
however the total was well below 1 million a year 
nonetheless the company had strongly fought the debarment 
action since being advised of the possibility last december 
arguing an entirely new management team had taken over and any 
damage that had been incurred had been incurred by consumers and 
not the federal government 
the government bought the juice for resale to military members 
and their families in commissaries countered gerald h werfel 
the dlas special assistant for contracting integrity in the 
debarment order 
the government paid for 100 percent pure apple juice received 
artificial juice and government employees were offered the 
artificial juice while assuming that the juice was 100 percent pure 
applie juice to say that the government was not damaged in these 
circumstances is further evidence of beechnuts continuing lack of 
responsibility 
werfel added the evidence was clearly sufficient to show that 
the beechnut corp was and is responsible for the actions of 
beechnut nutrition corp including its criminal activity from 
december 1981 through march 1983 
beechnut which is headquartered in fort washington pa said 
it found the dlas action inexplicable 
it is beyond question that our products today are authentic 
pure and safe added a company spokesman who asked not to be 
named 
this happened nearly six years ago and stringent quality 
control programs were put in place by the new management we are 
puzzled by this move and find it inexplicable that dla is impugning 
the current management by this action

restitution in a kickback case 
agnew is appealing a 1986 denial by the california franchise tax 
board of his request for a refund of 24197 
agnew who pleaded no contest to corruption charges and resigned 
as vice president in 1973 paid 142000 in restitution for 
allegedly accepting bribes from road engineering contractors while 
he was governor of maryland from 1967 to 1969 
the former vice president views the courtordered restitution as 
an expenditure and wants to recover a percentage of it said louis 
bertane senior counsel for the california board of equalization 
the appellate panel 
the boards ruling will be issued thursday the attorney said 
its fairly routine it doesnt present any extremely novel 
legal questions bertane said tuesday 
agnew originally sought the deduction on his 1981 tax return 
filed after he became a resident of rancho mirage and just months 
after he made restitution 
the franchise tax board in 1986 rejected the deduction because 
california has never received any income in the form of taxes or 
otherwise from the amounts agnew allegedly received as bribes 
to approve the deduction the board said would have the effect 
of requiring california taxpayers to subsidize agnews return of 
public monies to the taxpayers of maryland 
agnews lawyer t rogers harrison urged the board of 
equalization to ignore the identity of those involved

in the soviet union we know why the cuban people rose to make 
their revolution what enabled them to repulse the armed 
intervention survive the economic blockade cope with the 
persistent and exhausting pressure of their imperialist neighbor 
the island of freedom was able to stand its ground thanks to its 
proud and courageous people determined to fight for their 
independence for their right to live as they see fit they were 
able to do so because the revolution brought to the countrys helm 
a party committed to achieving lofty socialist ideals ideals of 
serving the people and finally they were able to do this because 
history had placed at their head one of the outstanding 
revolutionaries of the 20th century the legendary comrade fidel

considerations of the moment 
life does not mark time time presents us with new requirements 
and this applies particularly to economic links they must be made 
more dynamic more effective they must do more for both our 
countries our peoples as for today it is absolutely essential 
that there be more strictness discipline so that undertakings 
assumed be carried out in good time and with proper standards 
today only those can count on success who are marching in step 
with the times who are drawing the necessary conclusions from the

why is it that in outer space we perform miracles and in

is it that our progress has grown slower and how has it happened 
that in our society there are phenomena alien to socialism social

even the present state of reform has shown what a positive 
charge is inherent in these changes this is most important of all 
there is maximalism among some people among valuable proposals 
there are some that are controversial some that are unacceptable 
this is understandable it is due to our lack of experience 
poltical culture but all that will come we see how people are 
straightening out their shoulders how their social stature is 
growing how they are learning to solve problems in conditions of 
democratization and glasnost 
we do not regard our approaches and solutions as some universal 
prescription for all on the contrary problems may be similar but

of course the assertion of new thinking in the minds of the 
world public is a complicated matter too strong are the traditions 
and stereotypes and habits of the past we see how hard it is to 
digest for some of the western leaders who time and again slip from 
recognition of security to recurrency of the policy of strength to 
attempts to force their will on others 
the most immediate task now is to solve socalled regional 
conflicts analyzing their causes it is easy to come to the 
conclusion that they often emerge due to interference from the 
outside and the striving to force order on others that is attempts 
to interfere with other people in their attempt to make their own

signs that once identified segregated 
drinking fountains are still etched in the wall of the jones county 
courthouse but a supervisor said tuesday he supports plastering 
over them 
manuel jones naacp county president asked county supervisors 
monday that the signs be covered saying they remind people of a 
bygone era in the south when public buildings often had segregated 
facilities and entrances 
the signs were painted over some time in the past but the words 
white and colored still can be made out 
supervisor calvin holifield said that he would support 
plastering over the signs because obviously they are offensive to 
some people 
fellow supervisors monday tabled jones request to cover the 
signs saying they want to consult with the jones county historical 
society 
weve got so many problems in jones county that we havent 
taken action on this holifield said the courthouse is listed 
on the national register of historic places and when you touch 
something like that you have to consult them 
ellisville is the seat of the economically depressed largely 
rural county in the southern part of the state 
the courthouse was built in 1907 
bill thames president of the jones county historical society 
said the society had not considered the signs 
holifield who has served on the board one year said it was the 
first time anyone had brought the markers to his attention 
the civil rights act of 1964 prohibited segregation

democrats were favored to hold an 
alabama congressional seat in a special election tuesday that 
amounted to a test run for republicans hoping to gain ground in the 
deep south in 1990 
secretary of state glen browder the democratic nominee faced a 
lesserknown republican foe state sen john rice of opelika in a 
roughhouse namecalling race for the 3rd congressional district 
seat 
the seat was left vacant in december with the death of rep bill 
nichols a conservative democrat from sylacauga who held the mostly 
rural 13county east alabama district for 22 years 
the district which is about 75 percent white and dotted with 
small towns appeared readymade for the gops plan to bring such

districts votes last november

browder 46 a former political science professor at 
jacksonville state university was strongly supported by blacks and 
organized labor he has a reputation as an election reform advocate 
and was endorsed by all six daily newspapers that circulate in the 
district browder is from jacksonville but lives outside the 
district in montgomery 
rice 37 a real estate developer from opelika who switched 
parties last year after getting elected to the legislature as a 
democrat pinned his hopes on a campaign strategy of relentlessly 
labeling browder as a liberal 
gov guy hunt alabamas first republican governor this century 
toured the district regularly on behalf of rice 
browder ran television spots calling rice a hand grenade who 
had taken potentially explosive stands to cut federal aid to the 
elderly in half while voting to raise his legislative salary by 50 
percent 
browder also called rice an offthewall radical rice 
countered by calling browder a wimp a liberal a liar

divers pulled a car from the hatchie 
river on tuesday and recovered from it the body of an eighth victim 
of a weekend bridge collapse that may have been caused by flood 
damage 
four state inspection teams fanned out across western tennessee 
to check other bridges for weather damage 
state transportation commissioner jimmy evans said heavy spring 
floods after two years of drought probably contributed to the 
collapse saturday night by washing sandy soil away from the bridge 
supports 
were trying to make sure theres nothing that we have 
overlooked in this area he said 
the body found tuesday in a gray compact station wagon was not 
immediately identified 
seven other victims were recovered earlier 
crews searching the flooded river earlier in the day discovered 
signs of a possible fifth vehicle lost when a 90foot section of 
the us 51 bridge gave way 
a dog trained to smell bodies buried in rubble or under water 
pointed searchers to a section of the river adjacent to the 
accident on monday 
the objects position was confirmed tuesday by a boat crew using 
a magnet and a wrecker pulled the car out in the afternoon 
crews also set up a crane to lift away the concrete slabs 
covering at least three other cars and a tractortrailer 
workers had used jackhammers since the accident to break up the 
three slabs into pieces small enough to be raised by the crane 
state officials said the collapse about 50 miles north of 
memphis may have been caused by flood waters washing out the soil 
around the bridge supports 
the span that collapsed was 55 years old and carried two lanes 
of northbound traffic the adjacent bridge which carried 
southbound traffic was not damaged but has been closed

negotiators worked against the clock to 
resolve differences so the government and opposition can sign a 
historic pact wednesday to make solidarity legal again and bring 
free elections to communist poland 
although lastminute agreements on trade unions and political 
reforms were announced between solidarity and authorities tuesday 
night it was still uncertain if an overall pact would be signed 
wednesday 
the opposition said an objection to solidaritys wage indexing 
plan by the official trade union organization opzz could undo the 
entire deal on political and economic reforms after two months of 
grueling bargaining 
we are in a deep and serious impasse said solidarity 
spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz 
he said solidaritys national executive commission will meet in 
warsaw wednesday morning to decide if solidarity could sign the 
accords without opzzs agreement on a formula for indexing pay to 
the cost of living 
today we can only say that all possibilities are open he 
said when asked at a news conference if the free trade union 
movement might sign a partial accord or refuse to sign any accord 
at all 
solidarity leader lech walesa exhausted after a 10hour 
negotiating session went home to gdansk tuesday spokesmen said he 
would return to warsaw in time for any signing ceremony 
negotiators reached a final agreement on trade unions tuesday 
that would restore solidaritys legal status and reinstate people 
fired for union activity after the december 1981 imposition of 
martial law solidarity negotiator jacek merkel announced 
a team on political reforms successfully concluded talks late 
tuesday night pap reported the accord included bringing the 
opposition into parliament 
pap gave no details but earlier onyszkiewicz said solidarity 
won a concession that a twothirds majority in the sjem or 
parliament would be required to override the new senates veto of 
parliamentary measures authorities had wanted a smaller majority 
to be able to override the senate which is expected to become a 
bastion of the opposition 
pap also said the politburo the top communist party body led by 
polands leader gen wojciech jaruzelski met tuesday to discuss 
preparations for a final signing on wednesday 
it said the council of state also headed by jaruzelski 
meanwhile reviewed proposed changes in the constititution before 
they were sent to parliament 
an extraordinary committee of the sejm focused its discussions 
on the proposed new senate and presidency key elements of the 
roundtable agreements between authorities and solidarity the 
agency reported 
if a final agreement is signed wednesday parliament would meet 
as early as friday to enact the agreements into law the government 
has said 
monday would see the beginning of polands first open 
competitive election campaign since communists consolidated power 
after world war ii opposition sources said the opposition 
tentatively set two meetings this weekend to plan for the 
elections the communist party has scheduled a preelection 
conference may 45 
authorities proposed the roundtable negotiations in august 
during strikes that roughly coincided with the anniversary of 
solidaritys founding in the labor turmoil of 1980 
leaders of the official unions opposed solidaritys indexing 
formula to increase wages by 80 percent of the inflation rate they 
want payments of 100 percent of inflation regardless of a workers 
pay 
under the opzz formula if the average cost of living went up by 
50000 zlotys in a given month that sum would go to a worker 
earning 50000 as well as to one earning 150000 
polands annual inflation rate is more than 60 percent 
shortages of consumer goods are chronic and the foreign debt is 39 
billion 
a statement the official unions adopted monday said the 
solidarity formula would not contribute to a cooling down of 
unrest but can even lead to its aggravation 
spokesman franciszek ciemny said in an interview tuesday 
however that the official unions wanted to work the problem out 
and if the issue of indexation was to break up this table 
something is wrong 
the government created opzz to replace solidarity when the 
independent union movement was banned in 1982 under martial law 
but the official alliance has taken an independent militant 
position in the talks 
if solidarity becomes legal again opzz will lose its union 
monopoly and have to compete for worker support 
negotiators reached a broad outline of agreement early in the 
negotiations which began feb 6

president andres rodriguez said 
tuesday he will uphold human rights and civil liberties including 
freedom of expression 
dissent and criticism are no longer forbidden in paraguay 
said the 65yearold provisional president and army commander who 
toppled former president alfredo stroessner in a feb 3 coup 
the crucial role of a serious and honest press should not only 
be to secure democratic institutions but to project to the outside 
world the truth even if it contains imperfections he said in a 
speech to the interamerican press association 
in brazil it was reported the united states has rejected a 
request by stroessner for a temporary entrance visa stroessner 
who ruled paraguay for 34 years was given political asylum by 
brazil and arrived there feb 5 
paraguayan foreign minister luis maria argana said stroessner 
needs surgery for prostate cancer and the paraguayan government 
asked the us state department to grant him a temporary visa for 
humanitarian reasons but the answer was negative argana is in 
brasilia the brazilian capital for a diplomatic conference 
after speaking to the press association rodriguez mingled with 
the nearly 200 editors and publishers at the luxurious yacht and 
golf club on the outskirts of the capital asuncion 
i would have liked him to be more emphatic in defense of 
freedom of the press but its good just to have a paraguayan 
leader talking about it in general terms said eduardo uliberri 
director of costa ricas la nacion 
the general feeling in talking to the delegates is so far so 
good said douglas a gripp director of los angeles 
timeswashington post news service 
george neavoll editorial page editor for the wichita kan 
eaglebeacon said the speech was hopeful but its still a 
period of waitandsee 
rodriguez defended the coup that ended stroessners regime 
which was marked by confrontations with the roman catholic church 
economic setbacks military shakeups political repression and 
international isolation in its last months 
it was a legitimate reaction to an intolerable state of 
affairs that was dangerously deteriorating the image of my 
country he said 
rodriguez was introduced by aldo zuccolillo editor of the 
newspaper abc color which was closed by stroessner and allowed to 
reopen along with radio nanduti and the political weekly el 
pueblo after the coup 
we are enjoying freedom but we will not let down our guard 
zuccolillo said freedom can become a permanent way of life in 
this country 
rodriguez is the ruling colorado partys candidate for president 
in may 1 national elections which he is widely expected to win 
argana told the associated press in brasilia that stroessner 
76 must go to a country with advanced medical facilities and that 
he may go to switzerland 
stroessner is living in a beachfront mansion in the atlantic 
resort town of guaratuba about 500 miles southwest of rio de 
janeiro 
stroessner initially said he planned to live in brazil but 
recently expressed the desire to join his wife in florida

where an assassins bullet felled the civil rights leader 21 year 
ago

lawsuit in memphis over the plans to demolish the motel and erect 
the museum in its place 
the original plan was to convert it to a shrine to dr king

a dutch visitor on his way to an aids 
conference in san francisco was held in a minnesota prison tuesday 
because immigration authorities believe he has the disease 
the detention of hans paul verhoef prompted denunciations from 
aids activists and a san francisco congresswoman but immigration 
officials said they were just following the law 
we are holding mr verhoef as an excludable alien because he 
has a dangerous and contagious disease said tom schiltgen 
district director of the immigration and naturalization service in 
st paul 
verhoef 31 of rotterdam was apprehended at the 
minneapolisst paul airport on sunday by customs officials who 
discovered the aids drug azt in his baggage 
verhoef an aids prevention worker in his country acknowledged 
to immigration officials that he has acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
schiltgen said tests would be conducted to verify verhoef has 
the disease before authorities proceed with the case the tests 
should be completed without a few days he said 
joseph d cuddihy ins senior immigration examiner in 
washington said 10 to 15 people with aids have been turned away at 
the border prior to the verhoef case and an unknown number have 
been denied visas in their native country 
for years immigration laws have required people who want to 
visit or move here to establish they have no dangerous contagious 
diseases congress added aids to that list of diseases in 1987 
verhoef can withdraw his application for admission to the us 
and return to the netherlands or appeal his exclusion to the ins 
schiltgen said he said verhoef tentatively had decided to appeal 
verhoef was transferred tuesday from the scott county jail 
where he was held since sunday to a medical facility at stillwater 
state prison outside st paul schiltgen said 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif asked the us attorney general to 
approve a waiver that would free verhoef to complete his trip to 
san francisco 
dave runkel a top aide to attorney general dick thornburgh 
said late tuesday that the request for a waiver had not yet reached 
thornburghs desk 
we do not believe the intent behind the immigration law was to 
exclude tourists said pelosi 
he didnt try to hide it added steve morin an aide to 
pelosi we also question this on humanitarian grounds putting 
someone in jail under these circumstances 
the detention also drew fire from aids activists in san 
francisco where verhoef was to be a delegate to the international 
caucus of the 7th national aids forum and the 11th national gay and 
gay health conference they were to begin on wednesday 
what everyone is concerned about is that this is really a very 
upsetting precedent because it impacts the freedom of people with 
the aids virus to travel said steve huber a spokesman for the 
aids conference 
bea roman executive director of the national lesbian and gay 
health foundation said the conference is an important educational 
exchange for health care providers and educators worldwide in terms 
of aids prevention 
she said the exclusion of someone with the disease is 
detrimental to international cooperation in the fight against 
aids 
about 1500 people are expected to attend the conference

his nickname in high school was mayor and his 
traffic ticket on a trip home from college made frontpage news 
few men are to the manor born but richard m daley almost 
everyone said was born to be mayor 
on tuesday daley realized that destiny when he was elected to 
the office his father held for 21 years 
throughout a political career that had its beginnings nearly 30 
years ago the daley name made many of richard ms achievements 
possible diminished others and left him forever open to the 
charge that his vision extends only as far as his fathers shadow 
he lived at home until he was 30 and now at age 46 still 
lives only a few blocks from the bungalow where he grew up in the 
workingclass bridgeport neighborhood he looks walks talks and 
occasionally misspeaks in a way that makes him unmistakeably the 
son of richard j daley the late sixterm chicago mayor and 
bigcity boss 
he even began to look more like his father in recent weeks 
said eugene kennedy a loyola university professor he was 
chunkier more confident he gave the same monosyllabic answers 
with a lot of common sense in them 
the most frequent criticism of the younger daley is that he has 
the same politics as his father and will revive the daley 
machine kennedy author of himself a biography of the 
elder daley said he didnt think that was true 
for one thing a machine like the old mans is a political 
dinosaur that will never again roam the earth kennedy said also 
noting daleys unsuccessful 1983 mayoral bid chastened him 
the eldest son of seven children richard m daley cut his 
political teeth working as an 18yearold page for the illinois 
delegation to the 1960 democratic national convention 
daley graduated from law school in 1968 his father rewarded him 
with a job as an assistant corporation counsel after he passed the 
bar exam on his third try the elder daley also slated his son for 
a seat in the illinois constitutional convention 
then in 1972 his father sent old democratic machine warhorse 
ed nihill packing and virtually handed rich his seat in the 
illinois senate 
the younger daley was criticized in his early years called 
little more his fathers eyes and ears and dirty little 
richie by one colleague for using his chairmanship of the 
judiciary committee to routinely squash goodgovernment legislation 
but many of those same colleagues recalled how two events 
changed him irrevocably the first came on dec 20 1976 when his 
father died months into a sixth term a year and a half later his 
third child kevin was born with the crippling disease spina 
bifida 
after dad died rich looked at himself for the first time 
without dad looking over his shoulder recalled daleys brother 
bill his chief political strategist and the youngest of richard 
js seven children 
the strain of kevins illness may have an equally profound 
impact on his life 
daley began taking a leadership role in such legislative issues 
as nursing homes and abolishing taxes on some foods and medicine 
he showed a political acumen few thought him capable of and forged 
cautious alliances with the same reformers who often had opposed 
his father 
as a result when he ran for the first of his three terms as 
cook county states attorney in 1980 democrats slated alderman 
edward burke to run against him the younger daley clobbered burke 
then twice won reelection

friends and supporters of william heirens on 
tuesday pleaded for the release of the man sent to prison in 1946 
for committing three sensational murders and scrawling on the wall 
catch me before i kill more 
supporters told the illinois prisoner review board that heirens 
who has been denied parole 28 times is the very model of a 
rehabilitated prisoner 
but the brother and sister of one of his victims 6yearold 
suzanne degnan argued that heirens 60 would be a threat if freed 
under executive clemency and a prosecutor said heirens is a 
secret killer 
i just fear for children betty finn sister of suzanne 
said after the hearing i dont want another family to go through 
this again 
a lawyer for the parole board kent steinkamp said members will 
send their clemency recommendation soon to gov james r thompson 
who will make the final determination 
heirens was a 17yearold university of chicago freshman when he 
was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences he pleaded 
guilty to three murders and 25 burglaries 
the dismemberment of the degnan child followed the slayings of 
two women one stabbed the other shot and stabbed at one victims 
apartment heirens scrawled on a wall in lipstick for heavens 
sake catch me before i kill more i cannot control myself 
among the supporters urging heirens release was lawyer arthur 
odonnell who said heirens had gone from the depths of human 
dispair to become the first illinois prisoner to earn a college 
degree behind bars 
odonnell and other supporters described heirens as a sensitive 
man always willing to help fellow prisoners he argued that 
heirens should be released to show other inmates that there is hope 
through rehabilitation 
if we claim to be a civilized society than perpetual 
incarceration of anyone is antithetical to our society said 
odonnell 
assistant states attorney joseph mcnerney said heirenss 
supporters fail to see the nature of this mans problem 
outside prison he said heiren would be a danger 
hes a secret killer mcnerney said

the nevada senate on tuesday killed 
bullfrog county pop 0 
the county formed in an attempt to prevent the federal 
government from putting a nuclear waste dump there was ruled 
unconstitutional last year by the nevada supreme court 
its not that i loved bullfrog less but that i loved nevada 
more sen thomas hickey said in a eulogy that borrowed from 
shakespeares julius caesar as he was valiant i honor him 
but as he was ambitious they slew him 
hickey was a key sponsor of the bill that carved the 
144squaremile bullfrog county out of nye county in 1987 bullfrog 
county had no population no roads and surrounded yucca mountain 
which the federal department of energy is studying as the possible 
site for a highlevel nuclear waste dump 
gov bob miller and other state officials strongly oppose the 
dump and the desert county was formed solely to collect millions 
of dollars from the government by imposing the highest property tax 
rate allowed under the state constitution 
but nye county sued the state contending it was entitled to any 
money collected and a supreme court justice ruled that bullfrog 
county was unconstitutional because among other reasons it lacked 
a representative government

egyptian president hosni mubarak said tuesday 
he sees no way to stop the violence on the west bank and in gaza 
that has taken more than 400 lives since palestinian arabs began 
their revolt against israeli control nearly 16 months ago 
after meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii for two 
hours mubarak said that if anybody could stop it we would be 
very pleased then asked but how 
the egyptian leader nearing the end of two days of talks with 
bush administration officials made no public demands on the united 
states or israel he said he was simply trying to find out whats 
the best way to achieve peace through negotiations 
baker stood aside and in his only statement to reporters said 
it is important that we try and create a climate that can move us 
toward those negotiations and try and improve the atmosphere on the 
ground 
the next step in the search is a visit beginning wednesday by 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir he is expected to outline to 
president bush and baker a plan for holding elections among the 12 
million palestinians who live in the territories won from the arabs 
in the 1967 sixday war 
the idea behind shamirs proposal is to have palestinians choose 
leaders to negotiate with israel 
mubarak who has insisted that israel deal instead with the 
palestine liberation organization withheld judgment on shamirs 
proposal he said the criterion should be whether an election would 
help advance the peace process 
a us official briefing reporters later at the white house 
said we want to listen to what prime minister shamir has to say 
about how the peace process can be moved forward 
while shamir disclosed his proposal last week in israel he has 
withheld details until he sees bush and baker 
the us official whose identity could not be used under white 
house rules called the situation on the west bank untenable but 
declined to say whether the bush administration held the plo 
accountable 
i am not going to get into the causes and who is in 
control he said 
the palestinian rebellion which shamir and other israeli 
officials say was inspired and is maintained by the plo began in 
december 1987 and has had the effect of enhancing us interest in 
the situation on the west bank and in gaza since the rebellion 
began 418 palestinian arabs and 18 israelis have died 
mubarak in response to a question told reporters neither you 
nor anybody else would be able to stop the intefadeh uprising in 
arabic let us be realistic and practical we all hope that we 
could reach peace and avoid losing lives and spending money for 
killing and bloodshed 
earlier in an appeal for additional us economic and military 
aid mubarak told 15 senators that his nation had adopted economic 
reforms and needs a continued high level of us help 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine described the 
90minute private meeting as very beneficial and fruitful but 
said commitments on the aid issue were neither sought nor given 
both mitchell and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
said senators told the egyptian president that the united states 
must keep the large us budget deficit in mind in dealing with all 
requests for economic and military assistance 
mitchell said senators appeared favorably impressed with 
mubaraks description of egypts economic reform program including 
the reduction of subsidies on a number of consumer products and 
revisions in the countrys tax structure 
the president argued that the pace he is pursuing is the one 
most appropriate to their circumstances and the one most likely to 
bring success mitchell said 
the egyptian leader is hoping that congress will approve new 
weapons sales once they are formally proposed by the bush 
administration and that 230 million in us economic aid will be 
released the aid was withheld in march pending reforms in the way 
egypt manages its economy which that country must have in place by 
june 
meanwhile 200 american jews said in a statement released by

new yorks highest court tuesday cleared the 
way for trial of billions of dollars in lawsuits filed over des 
which has been blamed for cancer and sterility in women whose 
mothers took the antimiscarriage drug 
the court of appeals also determined that all companies that 
made the drug should be liable for any des damage awards won by new 
york residents even if those companies never marketed their pills 
in new york 
jay mayesh a lawyer for the pharmaceutical company upjohn said 
the ruling makes new york the only state to say all des 
manufacturers are liable for some damages 
the court upheld new yorks 1986 toxic torts law which 
covers purported victims of five chemicals and permits them to sue 
within three years after effects of the exposure are discovered 
prior to the law victims were required to sue within three years 
of actual exposure to a toxic substance 
the new law also gave those barred from suing under the old law 
a oneyear period in which to sue 
tuesdays ruling was praised by women who claim they were harmed 
by the des their mothers took between the late 1940s and early 
1970s the drug was marketed until 1971 
in virtually every des case victims had been barred from suing 
because the health problems didnt appear for many years after the 
usual state statute of limitations had expired 
however mayesh cautioned that the ruling only opens the way for 
juries to hear claims that people were harmed by exposure to des 
the issues decided here are procedural only said mayesh 
they do not address the fundamental question of whether des 
caused any of the health problems the plaintiffs claim it did that 
issue remains very hotly contested 
but in his ruling chief judge sol wachtler said there is 
strong evidence linking des exposure to later development of 
serious medical problems 
more than 500 des lawsuits seeking some 3 billion in damages 
were filed during the window created by the toxic tort law 
in addition to diethylstilbestrol or des the substances 
covered by the law are asbestos tungstencarbide chlordane and 
polyvinylchloride 
in wachtlers ruling the court of appeals rejected drug 
companies arguments that the law violates their rights to due 
process and equal protection 
a stickier legal question for the court apparently was how to 
determine which drug companies are responsible for the damages and 
how much they should pay 
the court decided unanimously that a market share theory 
similar to one first formulated by californias top court will be 
adopted in new york for apportioning damages from the des 
litigation 
that means drug companies in new york court cases will be liable 
for a percentage of damages corresponding to the percentage of the 
national des market they controlled while manufacturing the drug

the ethics committee on tuesday interviewed 
two men involved in a real estate deal with house speaker jim 
wright amid reports that wright may have accepted 100000 in 
unreported gifts from one of them 
the committee planned to resume its closeddoor deliberations on 
a long list of possible rules violations by wright on wednesday 
and a final outcome of the case still appeared to be more than a 
week away 
the wall street journal reported tuesday that the committee is 
considering whether wright violated rules by accepting use of a 
fort worth condominium a 1979 cadillac and a salary paid to his 
wife from fort worth developer george mallick a longtime friend 
and business partner of the wrights 
house rules prohibit the acceptance of gifts of more than 100 
from any person having a direct interest in legislation 
wright has steadfastly denied violating house rules but in a 
new variation on the denial mark johnson a spokesman for the 
speaker said tuesday that if the committee finds any rules 
infractions they would only be technical and not 
intentional 
the washington post in its wednesday editions said the ethics 
panel has concluded that several of the charges against wright 
should be dropped 
those include wrights intervention with federal banking 
regulators on behalf of hardpressed texas institutions his 
intercession with government officials on behalf of a texas oil and 
gas company and his use of a governmentpaid staff aide to compile 
parts of a book 
committee members met privately tuesday with mallick and with 
richard swann chairman of the pioneer savings bank in orlando 
fla to question them about an investment mallick and wright made 
in winderwood a housing development undertaken by swann and 
others beginning in 1985 wright made roughly 50000 on the deal 
were finetuning what we already knew said committee 
member john t myers rind 
the committee apparently is exploring whether wright or mallick 
had direct financial interests in the health of the savings and 
loan industry at a time when wright was lobbying federal regulators 
to be more lenient with ailing sampls 
one issue is whether a 22 million loan made to mallicks sons 
a loan mallick cosigned by a troubled savings and loan to 
develop a shopping center gave the developer an interest in 
legislation calling for forbearance toward sampls by federal 
regulators 
wright on tuesday denied any knowledge of the loan or a federal 
lawsuit against the mallicks to recover 1 million lost after the 
loan was foreclosed 
to say that i favored forbearance because of george mallick is 
ludicrous wright said he noted that other texas lawmakers had 
fought for the same provision in the law because the economy of 
our state was in crisis and our constituents were feeling the need 
for help 
the ethics committee has been investigating wrights finances 
since last june and has spent some 1 million on a probe by its 
outside counsel in the case richard phelan 
during depositions taken from mallick last year phelan was 
highly skeptical of benefits received by the wrights from their 
partnership with mallick known as mallightco that included the 
condominium which mallick made available to the wrights for a token 
fee the use of the car and mrs wrights 18000ayear salary 
investigators doubted what she had done in return for the 
salary said one source familiar with the case wright denied that 
the salary of his wife betty was a gift she performed work for 
the pay she received he said in answer to a reporters question 
the journal said the panel has discussed a total value for the 
benefits from mallightco of 100000 and said phelan views the 
benefits as unreported gifts 
mallick and his sons stephen and michael held a 22 million 
loan from interwest savings association of fort worth that was used 
to develop a shopping center the mallicks defaulted on the loan in 
1987 plus 100000 in unpaid interest and are being sued for the 
1 million that remained uncollected after the project was sold 
wright on tuesday called mallick a longtime friend and said the 
developer had never asked him to vote for or against any 
legislation he has never asked me for official assistance in any 
way shape or form wright told reporters adding that he had no 
knowledge of mallicks loan or the lawsuit until asked about it by 
a reporter on monday 
in pretrial testimony last year the senior mallick testified 
that federal regulators were partly to blame for his problems with 
the loan because they were pressuring sampls to foreclose on troubled 
loans rather than extending additional credit and working with 
borrowers to rescue investments 
many of the institutions were under the supervision of the 
regulators mallick said in a deposition taken by henry e kerry 
a fort worth attorney for interwest 
there was an atmosphere that existed to where in earlier days 
if you had problems like this you were able to have the 
flexibility to work them out because of this particular time in 
our industry that flexibility wasnt allowed because of the 
problems of the lenders themselves they werent able to be 
flexible with their borrowers in order to maneuver and work things 
out 
mallick organized a 1986 meeting at which area developers and 
lenders complained to wright about the heavyhandedness of 
regulators and prepared a long report on the subject at wrights 
request 
at the time wright also was lobbying colleagues to pass 
legislative language requiring that regulators show forbearance 
to troubled sampls even taking the unusual step of convening 
democrats on the house banking committee to plead for such language 
in a bill recapitalizing the federal savings amp loan insurance

academy awardwinning actress marlee matlin 
makes her speaking debut on sunday in bridge to silence on cbs 
matlin who is deaf won an oscar for her starring role opposite 
william hurt in the film version of the play children of a lesser 
god in that movie and in a subsequent small role in the film 
walker she played a deaf woman who communicated with sign 
language 
bridge to silence costarring lee remick michael okeefe 
and josef sommer is a complex emotional drama that gives full 
range to matlins considerable acting talent her speech is clear 
and definite her character uses both spoken word and sign language 
matlin plays peggy warner a deaf woman whose husband also deaf 
and a professor at gallaudet university is killed in a car 
accident peggy is left seriously injured and unable temporarily to 
care for her young daughter lisa 
remick plays peggys mother marge a perfectionist who cannot 
accept her daughters disability to the point of refusing to learn 
sign language marge takes peggys injury as an opportunity to 
appropriate perfect hearing lisa played by allison silva as her 
own 
sommer plays peggys father who is sympathetic to his daughter 
and disapproves of his wifes manipulation 
michael okeefe the great santini plays dan a longtime 
friend and director at the theatre for the deaf in michigan where 
peggy had met her husband john 
after johns death peggy withdraws in grief in a confrontation 
with marge peggy shouts at one point john loved me for what i 
am you never did 
much of the movies plot is made up of melodramatic devices 
basically dan hauls peggy back to michigan in hopes that getting 
her back into acting will release her from her pain of course the 
climax will be when marge finally accepts her daughter and comes 
for the first time to see her perform the play that dan casts 
peggy in is the glass menagerie 
phyllis frelich who played the same role as matlin in the stage 
version of children of a lesser god and won a tony plays an 
actress who appears in the play with matlin frelich recently 
launched a protest campaign against the cbs series the 
equalizer complaining that a hearing actress was hired to play a 
deaf woman in an episode 
the movie tends to stretch an already meager plot even thinner 
by such devices as having lisa develop a high fever the symptom 
that years earlier portended spinal meningitis in peggy and cost 
her her hearing 
still its worth it just to see the performances of remick and 
matlin these two can lift the most predictable scene to a level of 
high art the capable direction by karen arthur also helps 
but there are some nicely written scenes too such as the one 
where the deaf actors sit around the dining table and toast absent 
lisas birthday singing an ebullient happy birthday to you 
outloud and in sign language at the same time then they tell 
anecdotes of childhood poignantly recalling the difficulties of 
public schools and hearing pupils and parents who were hard to 
please 
of course we know peggy will eventually triumph and marge will 
see the error of her ways 
peggys climactic speech to her mother will no doubt be 
applauded by every deaf person whos ever contended with the 
ignorance of the hearing world i learned to speak for you but 
you never learned to sign for me im deaf but youre the one who 
cant hear

inflation isnt the only reason for the big 
price tags on new houses in recent years comfort and prestige on a 
luxurious scale probably count as much judging from a census 
bureau report 
data from the report show that much of the newhome construction 
market has gone upscale to a surprising extent at the very time 
oddly that pressure is growing for more affordable housing for 
young families 
the situation poses a dilemma for housing markets how can 
existing owners continue to move up to more expensive housing if 
firsttime buyers cannot afford to buy the houses the more affluent 
owners are leaving 
most of the demand for luxurious accommodations comes from 
existing owners who benefiting from rising market values in the 
past few years have amassed mountains of equity that can be 
applied to fulfilling their housing dreams 
eventually some housing people predict the trend to more 
expensive housing could automatically abort because of weakness in 
the lower end of the market leaving a dearth of the moveup buyers 
with sufficient equity 
the census bureau report shows that in 1988 the median size of 
new homes was 1815 square feet compared with 1605 square feet in 
1984 
more revealing are the amenities 42 percent with more than two 
baths compared with just 28 percent in 1984 26 percent with four 
bedrooms or more versus 18 percent in 1984 and 75 percent with 
central air versus 71 percent 
the proportion with more than one fireplace also rose to 65 
percent from 59 percent as did the proportion with garages able to 
accommodate more than two cars 65 percent against 55 percent 
a separate survey of homeowner preferences by the national 
association of home builders confirms that consumers seeking 
another home look for more room and more amenities and that they 
wont accept strippeddown houses 
at one time basic houses were viewed by government and industry 
officials as a practical means of providing shelter at relatively 
low prices while providing the owner the option of adding space 
when finances permitted 
analyzing the figures a home builder economist attributes at 
least part of the luxury phenomenon to demographics especially an 
aging of the population and income trends or a greater 
inequality in the distribution of income 
a more economical approach to housing and perhaps more in 
balance with an aging population could be detected in figures for 
multifamily housing which includes many rental units 
those figures from the same census bureau report show the 
median size of new units in 1988 was 935 square feet compared with 
871 square feet in 1984 units with two baths or more rose to 41 
percent from 35 percent 
however economic or demographic pressure was revealed in some 
of the other multifamily figures 
the percentage with two bedrooms rose only 1 percentage point 
from 54 to 55 between 1984 and 1988 units with three or more 
bedrooms dropped to 8 percent from 9 percent 
moreover the percentage of units constructed with air 
conditioning fell to 84 percent from 89 percent 
while these multifamily figures do suggest some leveling in the 
demand for luxuries they also remain extraordinarily high when 
matched against some of the data from another census bureau study 
this one in 1940 
in that census the median value of owneroccupied homes was 
2938 thirtyone percent of existing homes had no running water 
45 percent lacked complete private plumbing and fewer than half 
had central heat

in the land where it was born the 
ancient art of snake charming is dying and its half million 
practioners are vanishing 
hunger haunts them police chase them ecologists despise them 
people on the street no longer care for them 
snake charming is no more a paying profession said 
90yearold sunder nath our children are not interested in snake 
charming any more there is not enough money not enough charm left 
our children want to become clerks bus drivers even 
policemen but not snake charmers 
although he walks with the aid of a stick nath still holds road 
side shows 
the guru and saint of snake charmers is gorak nath who they say 
lived 500 years ago and all snake charmers take his last name 
molarband about 20 miles south of new delhi is one of the two 
villages in india exclusively inhabited by snake charmers the 
other village is in the state of orissa in eastern india 
about 1500 snake charmers live in molarband in mudandstone 
homes each home has 10 to 15 snakes 
gone are the days when our children lived with snakes grew 
with snakes said prabhu nath 50 whose two children attend a 
governmentrun school not far from mokarband now they are going 
to schools to learn english 
when i grow up i would like to become bus driver said 
15yearold rajpal nath a ninth grader my friends tell me that 
snake charming is nothing but another form of begging i dont want 
to be called a beggar 
there is no value in our fathers work we are looked down by 
everyone added 14yearold rameshchand nath who wants to be a 
bank clerk 
about 250 of the 1500 students at the school near molarband are 
from families of snake charmers 
this is remarkable said ram lal longia the schools 
headmaster ten years back we hardly had any student from the 
snake charmers families 
experts say the ranks of indias 500000 snake charmers are 
declining fast 
there are no new charmers joining the clan what we have is 
the old stock said komolesh dev who has spent months in 
molarband studying the life of the snake charmer 
there was a time when snake charmers were part of indian life 
they provided the best and cheapest entertainment 
but today who cares for them they are remembered only once a 
year during the snake festival 
every year on nag panchimi or snake god festival day 
hindus pray to snakes and feed them the brave among them wear 
snakes around their necks and some even pose with them for 
photographs 
women make snake beds in their homes and pray to snakes to give 
them sons 
only on that day we are in great demand said sambhu nath 
we offer our snakes for hire and make good money but it is only 
one day of bright sunshine in a year 
a team of two snake charmers on the average makes about 75 
rupees 5 a day 
from this amount we bribe the police feed our snakes and run 
our families sambhu nath said 
but there is no business during monsoon season and parts of 
indias blistering summer 
the indian wildlife act prohibits the possession sale or 
purchase of about 30 of indias 240 species of reptiles and the 
ban includes the king cobra the most prized possession of a snake 
charmer 
you cant hold a show with rat snake prakash nath said 
it ought to be a king cobra or at least a cobra only then 
people are interested 
first it is difficult to find a cobra because forests are 
vanishing and when we find one we cant keep it forever as it is 
against our tradition when a snake charmer decides catches a 
snake he performs a rite and pledges to release it within a year

audeh rantisi remembers that on a sunday 
morning in july 1948 an israeli soldier came to the door and told 
his mother the family would have to leave the house and go to the 
center of town 
audehs father george a soapmaker and landowner locked the 
front door of the fourroom stone house put the keys in his pocket 
and started walking he thought he would be home in time for dinner 
but their footsteps on the dusty road took them into the 
palestinian diaspora and audehs parents did not return to live in 
lod 
they were among the 600000 to 760000 arabs who left towns and 
villages in what is now israel during the first arabisraeli war 
according to benny morris an israeli historian who has studied the 
palestinian refugee problem 
the 1948 war started when israel declared its independence and 
arab countries attacked the new nation there was no state that 
belonged to the palestinians and many palestinians who lived in 
the area that is now israel left on the advice of arab leaders or 
to escape the war zone 
arabs who identify themselves as palestinians now number roughly 
47 million about half of the palestinians live in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip in the israeliannexed 
section of jerusalem or inside the borders of israel about 766000 
still live in refugee camps 
the rest are scattered 
a 15month palestinian uprising that began in december 1987 in 
the israelioccupied territories and a decision by the united 
states to talk with yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization have made the palestinians and their future a main 
element of the quest for peace 
because palestinians living abroad seek the right to return to 
their homes most of which were long ago destroyed or belong to 
israeli families the palestinian diaspora poses one of the 
thorniest peacemaking problems 
israeli politicians of the right and left are united in opposing 
the return of palestinians to what is now israel and many israelis 
are concerned about an influx of former guerrillas and 
improverished camp dwellers to a palestinian state created from the 
west bank and gaza strip 
the palestinian can be and has been a kuwaiti a jordanian 
a syrian an american a european but he never under any 
circumstances gave up that identification of being a 
palestinian said dr mahdi abdul hadi director of the 
palestinian academy for the study of international affairs in 
jerusalem 
for audeh rantisi then 11 his three younger brothers and two 
sisters leaving their home meant joining a stream of thousands of 
other palestinians uprooted from lod and ramle on july 1214 1948 
we didnt realize what was happening until we were out of 
town we hadnt taken anything with us no money no papers no 
clothes nobody thought we were being evicted for good said 
audeh who is now an episcopal pastor and political activist in the 
west bank town of ramallah 
according to israeli historical accounts israeli soldiers 
cleared the towns to secure the strategic highway linking tel aviv 
and the besieged city of jerusalem during the battle for 
independence 
the rantisi house later was rented by the israeli government to 
a jewish family who immigrated from morocco and was recently torn 
down to make way for modern apartments in one of historys 
ironies a palestinian family had begun a diaspora and a jewish 
family had returned from the diaspora 
other rantisi family members owned land at lod where jet 
airliners now take off and land at bengurion international airport 
like other refugees the rantisis dispersed throughout the 
world first driven by war to the west bank and later seeking 
respite abroad from the israeli occupation or in search of better 
opportunities for jobs and education 
audeh and his two sisters stayed in the west bank which israel 
seized from jordan in 1967 but his three brothers moved to 
toronto canada elias 48 works for a candy company mahfouz 41 
is an architect and philip 46 is a cabinet maker who first went 
to canada after working in kuwait 
audehs daughter susan 20 is studying biology at a college in 
aurora ill and hilary 16 goes to a girls preparatory school 
in bucknell england 
two cousins johnny and isa are goldsmiths in amman jordan 
where they fled after their beirut shop was ruined in lebanons 
civil war cousin jamil still runs a grocery in the embattled 
lebanese capital of beirut and cousin hany operates the 
traditional family soapmaking business in cairo egypt 
other relatives live in san francisco chicago and kenosha 
wis where jacob and john own the uptown restaurant 
the only branch of the family to remain in lod where only 8000 
of the 41000 residents are arab is headed by ibrahim abu isa 
rantisi 86 
over a cup of coffee laced with cognac he said the rantisi 
family had lived in lod since coming from the mediterranean island 
of crete hundreds of years ago about 20 percent of palestinians 
are christians and most of the rantisis are greek orthodox 
abu isa watched his grandchildren play with israelis in the 
streets of the mixed neighborhood and said he was resigned to 
living as part of a minority in a jewish state

do the rantisis expect to return to lod are they willing to 
compromise and settle for a palestinian state limited to the west 
bank would they return if a state was created 
the answers are varied in the rantisi family as they are among 
palestinians as a whole but there is a shared strong sense of 
national identity enhanced by pride in the success of the 
intefadeh the palestinian uprising in israeli occupied lands 
sitting on a cardboard box and sipping tea in his grocery store 
near the wehdat refugee camp in amman jordan isa samaan rantisi 
44 recalled that he had grown up with stories about massacres and 
expulsions and learned to hate israelis 
now i have become older and have more learning we cannot 
throw the israelis in the sea we want that we live and they live 
and to give both peoples a right to coexist said isa samaan 
in the west bank town of nablus randa rantisi 30 is a teacher 
whose students are active participants in the 15month palestinian 
revolt she said a ministate in the west bank and gaza strip was 
not enough 
i want to go back and live where my parents lived before if 
arafat wants only the gaza and west bank maybe others like 
guerrrilla leader george habash will continue fighting for the 
rest of palestine she said 
randas older brother ibrahim khalil was more concerned about 
the loss of business during the uprising than about the political 
future he is nonetheless indignant at the three times soldiers 
forced their way into his house looking for stone throwers and at 
being ordered on another occasion to clear a street of burning 
tires and barricades 
hoda 60 mother of randa and ibrahim recalls proudly that her 
cousin george habash helped carry her daughter during the long 
trek out of lod in july 1948 he looked very sad and was saying 
over and over god is with us and he will help us 
habash a pediatrician went on to become leader of the radical 
marxist popular front for the liberation of palestine and is now a 
leading opponent of arafats renunciation of terrorism and 
recognition of israel 
audeh 52 said the twoday forced march from lod to the west 
bank was a bitter experience that left deep psychological wounds 
the experience helped propel audeh into politics he was elected 
deputy mayor of ramallah in 1976 but deposed by israeli authorities 
in 1982 for refusing to cooperate with the armys newly created 
civil administration 
audeh a thin intense scholarly looking man who wears a black 
frock and white collar said the psychological healing process 
will take many years but that he is ready to turn the other cheek 
and make peace 
i do not have hatred in my heart i am ready to forgive 
but not to forget my rights god is a god of justice and 
righteousness said audeh 
audeh has no desire to move back to lod saying his life now 
revolves around his ministry and a private school he runs in 
ramallah but he said statehood would bring back his brothers from 
overseas and reunite the family 
would his family return 
elias rantisi who moved to canada 20 years ago seeking a 
better life said he was ready to give up his suburban home near 
toronto and take his wife and two children to palestine the 
instant a state was created 
this sense of nationalism is reflected by his 14yearold 
daughter madelane who seems far more likely than her father to 
realize such a dream i dont say im a canadian i say im a 
palestinian if anyone asks she told a reporter 
but most of the rantisi family living abroad gave uncertain 
answers about whether they would risk uprooting their families 
its not easy to leave said jacob 40 who owns the uptown 
restaurant with his brother john 30 in kenosha 
memories of the west bank are romantic sweet plum and almond 
trees soft breezes and a slower pace of life its a happy life 
without the complications here theres too much to worry about 
money bills etc said jacob 
in ammans gold market leaning over a counter filled with 
earrings and pendants isa ibrahim rantisi recalled that he visited 
his birthplace in 1967 and found a jewish family from morocco in 
the house 
when he went inside the house i remembered everything it was 
like a photograph 
isa said he did not blame the israeli family who rented the 
house but said he could not give up his right to return and 
reclaim what belonged to his family 
how could we give it up he asked if i dont get it back 
my son will

jacob and john rantisi have built a life in 
america but their hearts and minds often are in a faraway land 
where they knew the joy of being united with family and the pain of 
seeing their world torn apart 
today the palestinian brothers are us citizens grateful for 
freedom and success in their adopted country but worried about and 
longing for the simple yet turbulent homeland they left behind 
its impossible to forget your language your home and your 
people said jacob 40 who with his younger brother john owns a 
restaurant in this industrial city 
i am willing to be a good citizen of the united states he 
said but there is no way you can forget your homeland when 
you grow up in a place you learn to love that place 
i remember my friends said john smoking a cigarette as he 
and his brother sat in a booth in their restaurant its my home 
its inside of me 
from a cramped single room they shared in the west bank town of 
ramallah the 11 children born to sulieman and rose rantisi have 
migrated to all corners of the world canada saudia arabia 
jordan israel and the united states three are in kenosha with 
their mother sulieman died in 1974 
two brothers jaber and audeh remain in ramallah their cousin 
audeh an episcopal priest also lives there a sister nadia lives 
in jerusalem the family keeps in contact with letters and phone 
calls 
the rantisi brothers who are christians grew up with the state 
of israel shortly after israeli soldiers forced most palestinians 
out of lod during israels war of independence in 1948 jacob was 
born in a cold cement room in ramallah without doctors or nurses 
in the following decades israel conquered the west bank and the 
family lived with the turmoil of tanks in the streets fear of 
bombings and worries about eviction 
but the brothers who built furniture in a small shop also have 
fond memories of sweet plum and almond trees soft breezes and a 
slower pace 
its a happy life without the complications like here jacob 
said over here theres too much to worry about money bills 
 
in 1976 jacob and his wife victoria came to illinois his 
inlaws lived there and husband and wife began working in factories 
we thought we could have a better opportunity here jacob 
said there the economic situation was very bad 
there were other motivations youre not free there he 
added if theres a demonstration or a bomb it makes everybody 
fear theyre going to be arrested there is no peace 
john 30 a bachelor followed in 1979 and also worked in a 
factory they saved their money and though they had no restaurant 
experience they bought a small coffee shop in 1985 
the brothers work 13hour days seven days a week washing 
dishes cleaning and cooking in their uptown restaurant which is 
simply decorated with salmoncolored formica tables and brown 
naugahyde booths 
we didnt get rich here but we have a better standard of 
living said jacob he said he and his wife speak arabic at home 
and try to instill palestinian culture in their three children 
the brothers say they are tied by blood and spirit to the land 
they still call palestine and are troubled by the violence of the 
intefadeh the uprising against israeli occupation in the west bank 
and gaza strip 
when you see it on tv especially when they beat a person 10 
years old or 12 years old or a lady you get upset you get 
angry jacob said its a very very evil thing that they treat 
human beings like that i know it happens in different 
countries but when you see this happen to your own country 
your own people i dont think god himself justified this 
the palestinians are suffering in a way like the jews suffered 
from the germans he continued by beating people and 
shooting people breaking their arms breaking their noses its 
the same killing is killing suffering is suffering you cant 
justify what hitler did and you cant justify what the israelis are 
doing against the palestinians 
the brothers are hopeful a palestinian state will emerge though 
they arent certain how it would affect their lives 
a settlement is needed soon john said before its too late 
before people get more anger and more hatred 
but jacob said if one comes i dont see its going to last 
for too long neither one will be satisfied with their share 
would they return 
jacob said he might try to open a business but would have to 
give it careful consideration i live here 12 years he said 
its not easy to leave 
john agreed if i go back home one day he said softly 
im going to miss america

this is a metropolis of refugees the 
capital of one country it is filled with palestinians who cherish 
dreams of another country across the jordan river 
amman was a dusty backwater of 35000 people when the first 
arabisraeli war broke out in 1948 that conflict and its 
successor in 1967 flooded jordan with refugees and many of them 
settled in and around the capital 
today about 70 percent of the 12 million residents of amman 
are palestinians making it the largest urban concentration of 
palestinians anywhere 
welleducated palestinians many sending home money from jobs in 
the persian gulf helped make jordan into one of the third worlds 
success stories despite the countrys lack of natural resources 
expensive cars roam ammans streets and spacious houses sprawl 
across its hills shops sell french cheeses italian clothes and 
danish furniture to a population that averaged more than 2000 per 
capita a year in income before an economic recession set in two 
years ago 
the palestinian stamp is evident in the savory aroma of 
palestinian sweets wafting from bakeries and in the elaborately 
embroidered palestinian dresses worn by many women 
young men wear the blackchecked kaffiyeh headdress that has 
become an emblem of the palestinian uprising against israels 
21year occupation of the west bank of the jordan river 
but palestinians in amman find themselves torn between two 
nationalities that of jordan and that of a new palestinian state 
declared in november by the palestine liberation organization 
that conflict led to a war in 1970 and the defeat of palestinian 
guerrillas by jordans bedouin army palestinians refer to the 
supression of the palestinian state within jordan as black 
september 
but for many there is no conflict they hope to remain in 
jordan at least part of the time even if they gain a state in 
palestine 
i dont see that there has to be a choice said hazem 
nuseibeh a former jordanian foreign minister who comes from one of 
jerusalems most prominent palestinian families 
to the contrary i think if there is a solution it will be the 
creation of a jordanianpalestinian confederal union 
isa samaan rantisi 52 an amman grocer expressed gratitude 
toward the country that sheltered his impoverished family some 40 
years ago when it crowded into a oneroom storefront in an amman 
ravine 
they gave us everything here more than any other arab 
country he told a reporter we dont think of ourselves as 
strangers 
but his 18yearold nephew raed shamali like many youths in 
amman said he yearns to go home to a country he has never known 
if i could go i would go its my country we should go 
back said shamali who wore a scarf fringed in the green black 
white and red colors of the palestinian flag as he served customers 
in the crowded store 
in 1950 jordan annexed the west bank and gave the palestinians 
citizenship in jordan but jordan lost the terrority to israel in 
the 1967 arabisraeli war 
king hussein in 1988 renounced claims to the west bank 
declaring jordan is not palestine a reference to proposals 
from israelis that jordan serve as the palestinian state rather 
than let refugees reclaim property in what is now israel 
hussein said palestinians in jordan would have all the rights 
and privileges of jordanian citizens until a palestinian state is 
created

in statehouses across the country lawmakers fear any 
significant alteration to roe vs wade could trigger a political 
war that would make their years as reluctant soldiers in the 
abortion battles seem like a skirmish 
the landmark 1973 us supreme court decision legalizing 
abortion ended most of the fierce struggling over the issue in 
state legislatures but with the court reconsidering the issue 
legislators are worrying about a return to the incessant emotional 
wrangling that preceded the ruling 
if they overturn roe it will be the most tragic thing to 
happen in a long time said rep hl jensen a democrat from 
jackson wyo who is the state house minority floor leader it 
will really be a nightmare 
the high court is scheduled to hear arguments april 26 on 
missouri abortion regulations struck down last july by the 8th us 
circuit court of appeals 
groups on both sides of the issue believe the supreme court 
might use the case to modify if not overturn the roe vs wade 
decision thirtyfour states banned or severely restricted 
abortions in 1973 and 15 states still have antiabortion laws on 
the books although legal experts say it is not clear they could 
take effect if roe vs wade was reversed 
gosh i hope they dont stir that up again it was one of 
the worst things ive been through as a legislator said 
republican rep marvin littlejohn chairman of the kansas house 
public health and welfare committee recalling the preroe days 
when strident signcarrying abortion foes jammed the statehouse to 
protest kansas liberal law 
the appeals court struck down key provisions of the missouri law 
that banned use of public hospitals or public employees for 
abortions prohibited use of taxpayer money for abortion 
counseling required doctors to test a fetus older than 19 weeks 
for viability and declared that life begins at conception 
most states stayed out of the case but a few decided to enter 
the fray 
louisiana which boasts of having the nations most stringent 
antiabortion laws on the books was joined by arizona idaho 
pennsylvania and wisconsin in filing a brief with the supreme court 
supporting missouris position 
massachusetts which won a 1988 court case blocking reagan 
administration efforts to ban abortion at federally financed family 
planning clinics filed a brief arguing against missouri its brief 
was signed by california colorado new york texas vermont and 
west virginia 
most states have adopted a waitandsee attitude but forces on 
both sides of the issue have begun mobilizing support 
im sure if they overturned the decision there will be at 
least a dozen legislators jumping in with bills said russell 
maffei legislative aide to new jersey state sen gerald cardinale 
a recently announced republican candidate for governor it would 
be a knockdown dragout fight decided by halfdozen votes one way 
or the other 
the supreme courts decision in the missouri case expected in 
july would come too late for the battles to begin this year 
instead most legislators see themselves starting the new decade 
under siege if roe vs wade is altered 
that would tie up every legislature in the united states in a 
bitter debate said bradford gorham rhode island house minority 
leader 
for some such as maryland that means the continuation of a 
nowin struggle that began in 1973 to whittle away at roe vs wade 
on a local level last year business stopped for several days in 
the maryland senate while antiabortion lawmakers filibustered a 
budget bill amendment to ease restrictions on medicaid financing of 
abortions 
prochoice legislators hold a one or twovote margin in the 
maryland senate not enough to stop a filibuster but sufficient to 
block antiabortion legislation the result is a stalemate a 
situation not likely to change 
there is a gridlock with very very strong intense views that 
seem not to be able to get either position to move maryland 
attorney general j joseph curran said thats the reality of 
this state 
a reversal by the supreme court likely would trigger new legal 
fights over whether the antiabortion laws still on the books in 15 
states could take effect 
in maryland for example the old law required all abortions to 
be approved by a hospital board and performed in a hospital the 
old laws in arizona idaho and wisconsin made all abortions illegal 
except those to save a mothers life in oklahoma the preroe law 
provided for a prison term of up to five years for anyone convicted 
of performing an abortion 
abortion opponents have kept the issue alive in many states as 
much as the courts have allowed two dozen states have passed laws 
that mandate parental consent for abortions for minor women 
parental notification or both and 10 or so are considering such 
bills this year 
all but a dozen states have cut off medicaid financing of 
abortions for poor women in many of those states efforts to 
restrict that money come up year after year in california for 
example the legislature has passed abortionfunding limits every 
year for the last decade only to have them struck down by state 
courts 
fights over such restrictions while often heated and 
disruptive would pale next to the battles that might ensue if the 
justices were to return abortion to state control some observers 
say 
once it goes back to the states and people will be playing 
with real bullets its a whole different ballgame said michael 
friedman a democrat from miami beach in the florida house 
many legislators predict a reversal of roe vs wade would result 
in the issue dominating the legislative and electoral processes in 
many states 
ive always said that if the court overturns on tuesday wed 
introduce legislation on wednesday to outlaw abortions said 
pennsylvania lawmaker stephen freind leader of the antiabortion 
forces in that states general assembly 
any meaningful debate on any other public policy would come to 
a standstill said roger moe majority leader in the minnesota 
senate the question would be are you for or against abortion 
thats how candidates would be picked regardless of how they stand 
on other important matters

the first battles following any major 
change in the us supreme courts 1973 ruling legalizing abortion 
probably would erupt in louisiana and 14 other states that still 
have antiabortion laws on the books 
the laws now are unenforceable because of the roe vs wade 
decision but there is debate over whether they could take effect 
if the high court ever overturned the 1973 ruling the issue would 
head immediately for the courts 
louisianas law says that if the high court ever reverses the 
1973 decision the states antiabortion rules go back into force 
idaho and illinois have similar laws 
our law is broad and general and says the state can regulate 
abortions totally within limits of the us supreme court 
decisions said jo anne lavert a staff attorney for attorney 
general william guste 
however democratic state rep woody jenkins who has written 
most of louisianas antiabortion laws since 1973 said he doubted 
the laws could take effect again and predicted a new law would have 
to be passed 
daniel stier an assistant attorney general in wisconsin which 
has an antiabortion law on the books from before the 1973 ruling 
said he was not sure what would happen 
until we get a decision its so speculative it would be a 
waste of time to guess what the effect would be on wisconsin law 
he said there are an infinite number of possibilities of what 
might happen to the laws on our books 
stier said he would advise district attorneys not to begin 
prosecuting women for violating state law if the supreme court 
reversed roe vs wade 
walter turner an assistant state attorney general in alabama 
said his office could not speak specifically about the states 1852 
antiabortion law unless the supreme court overturned roe vs wade 
but he said there had been previous cases in which old state laws 
went back into effect after the supreme court reversed itself 
the other states with antiabortion laws predating roe vs wade 
are arkansas arizona connectituct delaware michigan 
mississippi new hampshire oklahoma south dakota and west 
virginia an attempt to repeal new hampshires law has passed the 
house and is now before the senate 
louisiana officials contend the antiabortion law the state 
enacted in reaction to roe vs wade is the most stringent in the 
nation 
before 1973 abortion was a criminal offense in louisiana 
anyone giving an abortion could get up to 10 years in prison at 
hard labor 
since then louisiana has passed many antiabortion laws that 
have been found unconstitutional by the courts among the 
provisions thrown out were rules forbidding abortions in the first 
three months of pregnancy requiring doctors to test the fetus to 
see if it could live mandating parental consent for minors and 
requiring abortions to be performed only at hospitals by physicians 
the only two provisions upheld prohibit public financing for 
abortions and require that parents of minors be notified of plans 
for an abortion

new york was the nations abortion capital 
before the us supreme court legalized abortions nationwide in 
1973 and it likely would emerge again as a haven if the court ever 
reversed the roe vs wade decision 
women wanting to end their pregnancies would have more options 
than they did 16 years ago when 34 states outlawed abortions but 
new york still has very liberal rules on who may have an abortion 
some states allow the procedure only because of roe vs wade and 
would see renewed attempts to outlaw or restrict abortions fifteen 
states still have antiabortion laws on the books although there 
is debate whether they could take effect if roe vs wade was 
reversed 
new york would retain the abortion laws it has now and women 
from other states would come in here to get freely accessible 
abortions which would be a burden on health services predicted 
janet benshoof director of reproductive freedom for the american 
civil liberties union 
under new yorks law abortions are permitted up to the 24th 
week of pregnancy as long as they are performed by a physician 
abortions after 24 weeks are allowed if a womans life is in danger 
new york is one of just 12 states that still provide medicaid 
money for abortions for poor women and it was the only one of the 
16 states permitting abortions before 1973 that did not restrict 
abortions to state residents 
in neighboring pennsylvania by contrast women under age 18 are 
required to get their parents consent for an abortion the state 
also requires women to be hospitalized for the procedure and to 
report it to state authorities 
things are even more restrictive in some parts of the midwest 
benshoof said she said she knows of women who have flown into new 
york for abortions from minnesota where abortions are prohibited 
after 20 weeks of pregnancy 
all these reasons make abortion more delayed and more 
expensive she said these women would want to come to new york 
to avoid humiliation and unnecessary delay 
that was the practice during the brief period between the 
legalization of abortion in new york in 1970 and the roe vs wade 
ruling young women stopped flying to england or sweden and instead 
came to new york 
in 1972 a record 281000 abortions were performed in the state 
by 1974 the first year after roe vs wade the number had fallen 
to 162000 and has been relatively constant ever since

barring another big us drought or a major 
disruption of international markets by sudden global losses in crop 
or energy production it looks like another year of moderate food 
price increases for american consumers 
the agriculture department is forecasing that retail food prices 
may rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 1989 about in line with the 
upward creep of recent years that estimate averages 12 monthly 
projections 
but food ecomomist ralph parlett says the usda forecast could be 
revised later this month following a review of the price situation 
for the first three months of this year 
what were looking at primarily is that weve gotten so much 
stronger firstquarter prices particularly in fruits and 
vegetables than we had anticipated parlett said we sort of 
missed with the cold weather in california and some in florida 
too 
according to the departments economic research service if the 
1989 forecast is revised upward by a full percentage point to a 
range of 4 percent to 6 percent and if it proves to be accurate 
the gains in food prices would be the highest in eight years 
in 1988 the average of monthly food prices rose an average of 
41 percent the same as in 1987 the annual increases previously 
included 86 percent in 1980 79 percent in 1981 4 percent in 
1982 21 percent in 1983 38 percent in 1984 23 percent in 1985 
and 32 percent in 1986 
denis dunham another usda analyst notes in a new review that 
food costs rose at a much higher rate in the second half of 1988 
than in the first half due to the severe drought and other market 
factors 
by december he said prices were 52 percent higher than in 
december 1987 the biggest jump since 1980 
the average 41 percent increase in last years food prices was 
exactly in step with the broader rise in living costs as measured 
by the labor departments bureau of labor statistics in 1987 when 
food prices also rose 41 percent the overall index gained just 
36 percent 
economists look at two major components food sold in grocery 
stores for use at home and meals and snacks consumed away from 
home the two rose at almost identical average rates over the 
entire year 
but measured from december to december food prices in grocery 
stores went up much more rapidly partly because last summers 
drought boosted prices for fresh vegetables cereals and bakery 
products eggs and fats and oils by december the foodathome 
index was up 56 percent from a year earlier 
food served in restaurants which is affected less by the costs 
of raw products increased only 44 percent from december to 
december 
dunham said the cost of the traditional market basket of food 
items used to compare retail marketing and farm values from year 
to year rose 35 percent in 1988 the market basket includes only 
grocery items produced on us farms it doesnt include imported 
products or seafood 
one of the features of the usda market basket analysis is the 
farm value of various products it is a translation of prices 
received by farmers into an equivalent amount for a specific item 
or quantity of food 
for example the average retail price of a pound of choicegrade 
beef as measured on an allcut basis was 255 in 1988 the 
producers share or farm value was 147 or 58 percent of what 
shoppers paid but that doesnt mean live cattle sold for 147 per 
pound because it takes 24 pounds of live animal to make one pound 
of supermarket beef 
items that require lots of processing beef does not 
relatively speaking show much smaller farm values a one pound 
loaf of white bread for example sold for 61 cents last year the 
farmers share for all ingredients was five cents or 8 percent 
and that was up a penny from 1987 
overall the farm value of market basket food in 1988 
represented about 30 percent of the total unchanged from 1987 and 
the smallest farmers share of the consumer food dollar since usda 
began compiling such figures more than 75 years ago 
department records show the farm value or share of the food 
dollar averaged 46 percent in 1913 the prevous low mark was 32 
percent in the early 1930s the high was more than 50 percent in 
world war ii and for several years thereafter 
some economists including usdas parlett say that the trend to 
a smaller share for the farmer also reflects a growing consumer 
preference for a greater degree of processing in food hundreds of 
preparations microwave items and many others commonly found in 
todays supermarkets were unheard of a few years ago 
it adds up to huge spending on food 
in 1988 according to usda analysts consumers spent an 
estimated 394 billion in 1988 for foods produced on us farms up 
19 billion or about 5 percent from 1987 that includes both meals 
at home and away from home 
some 975 billion or about 25 percent of the total spent was 
returned to farmers a weighted blend of the 30 percent share for 
food at home and the much smaller 16 percent share of spending for 
food eaten away from home in 1987 the farm share was 928 
billion 
the remaining 297 billion or the marketing bill to get 
food from the farm to consumers went to the food industry for 
handling processing and retailing food after it left the farm 
that was up 14 billion

following a trail that led from the university 
of virginia to a georgia army camp to the nations capital two 
scholarly sleuths have come up with evidence of how thomas 
jefferson enriched the beginning of the american mind 
on thursday the library of congress will publish the results of 
their work thomas jeffersons library a catalog with the 
entries in his own order in celebration of the 246th anniversary 
of the birth of the bookloving second president 
his library not only offers a key to his own thinking but also 
symbolizes an admirable and important part of the cultural 
tradition of the american society he envisioned and helped to 
found james gilreath and douglas l wilson wrote in their 
introduction 
we knew that jefferson had selected his library to be the best 
of what the old world could offer gilreath said in an interview 
but what is striking to my way of thinking is how much hope he 
had for the new world to develop this 
at the end he always includes the american books which were 
not at that time in the league with the european books but it is 
clear that what he is anticipating is that this is the beginning of 
the american mind 
gilreath the head of the rare book division of the library of 
congress and wilson a jefferson authority at knox college in 
galesburg ill claim to have solved a longstanding puzzle about 
how the sage of monticello divided up his books by subject matter 
the mystery they set out to investigate revolves around the 
library of approximately 6700 volumes that jefferson sold to 
congress in 1815 after the original congressional library was 
burned by the british in the war of 1812 
the books carted from monticello in wagons formed the nucleus 
of the present library of congress some twothirds of them burned 
in another fire in 1851 but about 2700 of jeffersons volumes 
still occupy two roomlong book stacks in a vault in the rare book 
division 
there has long been confusion however about how jefferson 
intended the books to be catalogued he divided the books into the 
categories of history philosophy and the fine arts an adaptation 
of francis bacons organization of knowledge into the categories of 
memory reason and imagination 
within these divisions according to a letter he wrote to a 
friend he arranged the books in a chronological or analytical 
order 
librarian of congress george waterston who wrote that he 
singlehandedly labeled and shelved the books when they arrived in 
washington preserved jeffersons main divisions but arranged the 
books within each division alphabetically 
jefferson said the change much injured his catalogue 
unfortunately waterston took jeffersons own catalogue with him 
when he was fired as librarian in 1829 and it has never been 
located 
in a massive fivevolume work published by the library from 1952 
to 1959 e millicent sowerby tried to recreate jeffersons 
arrangement by using another manuscript catalog that jefferson had 
composed in 1783 and revised extensively by writing between the 
lines by the time she reached the fourth volume sowerby was 
conceding that the catalog jefferson sent to congress with his 
books differed substantially from the one she was using 
at the time wilson author of a soontobe published edition of 
jeffersons notebooks was consulting the 1783 catalog which is at 
the massachusetts historical society 
i formed some very different ideas he said in a telephone 
interview 
gilreath agreed with him 
gilreath went to the end of one of the shelves at the library of 
congress that hold the original jefferson collection picked up a 
slim volume that had lain there uncatalogued since 1954 and asked 
now what do you make of this 
i think this is what were looking for said wilson a 
professor of english and director of the knox college library 
the volume contained a manuscript catalog believed to have been 
prepared for jefferson in 1823 by nicholas p trist a young man 
who would later become his grandsoninlaw and his private 
secretary 
correspondence between jefferson at monticello and trist in 
louisiana showed that jefferson had sent trist a printed catalogue 
probably waterstons catalog with jeffersons handwritten notes of 
the changes he wanted made using this trist prepared a manuscript 
showing the way jefferson wanted his books arranged he sent it 
back to jefferson along with the printed catalog 
the printed version has been lost but trists manuscript was 
found in 1917 in the library at camp wheeler in georgia it was 
donated to the library of congress 
the manuscript bound in a volume along with a copy of the 1815 
printed catalog is inscribed pearce lewis 1834 university of 
virginia 
for years the book was mistakenly labeled as a catalog of the 
university of virginia library gilreath and wilson believe 
jefferson may have intended it to go there since he was organizing 
the universitys library at the time 
at any rate it was kept in the library of congress manuscript 
collection until 1954 when somebody decided it should be in the 
rare book division because part of it was printed 
the first clue gilreath and wilson had was that trists 
manuscript and the printed catalog covered the same books in a 
different order 
in the trist manuscript books were arranged according to 
jeffersons values the lewis and clark expedition placed ahead of 
the much earlier explorations of la salle recent books on greek 
and roman ruins placed at the head of the chapter on architecture 
so then we went to a lot of other sources and we discovered 
this letter from trist indicating that he was sending back this 
catalog to jefferson that jefferson obviously went to him and that 
the catalog had been transcribed gilreath said 
the clincher he said was when they were able to authenticate 
the trist manuscript by establishing that its paper and bindings 
were identical with those in trists notebooks of the time

a group led by exbaseball commissioner peter 
ueberroth could present a reduced bid for striketorn eastern 
airlines to a committee representing eastern creditors at a meeting 
today 
the ueberroth group plans to lower its 464 million bid for 
miamibased eastern sources close to the sports figure and 
businessman said monday 
the reduced offer would reflect developer donald trumps new 
agreement with texas air corp to buy easterns prized northeast 
shuttle for 365 million the sources said ueberroths original 
proposal which was withdrawn last week after he was informed it 
had been topped by another suitor was for all of eastern 
including the bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle service 
separately union and airline sources said monday that the 
15member committee representing unsecured creditors of eastern was 
asking those interested in buying the airline to present their 
offers at a meeting today 
union sources also said that the air line pilots association has 
agreed to meet in the next few days with possible eastern suitor 
jay pritzker head of the hyatt corp hotel chain 
the ueberroth group on thursday withdrew its 464 million offer 
for eastern after texas air said it had been materially outbid 
by another suitor identified by sources as pritzker 
however texas air hasnt eliminated ueberroths bid from 
consideration sources close to the company have said 
pritzker offered about 500 million for the entire airline 
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the hyatt 
chairman is expected to meet soon with the eastern pilots union 
possibly today union sources said 
pritzkers offer is comprised of about 100 million in cash and 
the rest in debt securities according to sources the ueberroth 
group on the other hand has said its 464 million offer included 
about 200 million in cash 
takeover strategist carl icahn the owner and chairman of trans 
world airlines inc also has expressed interest in eastern and has 
garnered support from its unions but he has not yet presented an 
offer to the texas air board 
the ueberroth group offered to give eastern employees a 30 
percent stake in the airline in exchange for salary concessions 
the proposals by pritzker and icahn would involve similar 
arrangements according to sources 
ueberroth icahn and pritzker were reported to be unavailable 
for comment when contacted monday 
in addition to reviewing bids the creditors committee also may 
discuss strategy and organizational issues related to easterns 
reorganization under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws 
according to people familiar with the proceedings who asked not to 
be identified 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland who is overseeing 
easterns reorganization has asked members of the creditors 
committee not to discuss developments at todays meeting with the 
press the sources said the meeting possibly the first of a 
weekly series is expected to be held in the offices of lawyers 
representing one of the creditors they said 
the creditors committee includes representatives of major 
aircraft and engine manufacturers banks acting as trustees for 
eastern bondholders and the eastern machinists and pilots and 
nonunion employees 
the panel has the right to review any reorganization plan 
proposed by eastern and can propose its own plan to the bankruptcy 
judge it represents unsecured creditors who are the most likely 
to lose money in the bankruptcy reorganization because they have no 
collateral or security from eastern in case of default 
the machinists union at eastern struck the airline march 4 
drawing the support of pilots and flight attendants and bringing 
operations to a virtual halt eastern was forced to seek 
reorganization and bankruptcy protection from creditors five days 
later as its cash reserves dwindled

chrysler corp has upped the ante in 
what could be a highstakes matchme incentive game by offering 
interestfree financing on twoyear loans for all of its cars 
the nations no 3 automaker made the move monday five days 
after ford motor co challenged the other automakers with 29 
percent financing for twoyear terms general motors corp followed 
fords lead a day later 
interestfree automobile financing was last offered in september 
1986 by american motors corp which chrysler bought less than a 
year later 
chairman ben bidwell of chrysler motors corp the corporations 
carmaking arm called the free financing deal the ultimate in 
apr annual percentage rate programs 
it cant get any lower he added it cant get any 
simpler 
in addition to the low financing for twoyear terms each of the 
big three also expanded and boosted some of their cash rebates and 
offered 59 percent financing for threeyear loans and 69 percent 
for fouryear notes 
ford and gm will write a fiveyear loan for 99 percent 1 
percentage point lower than chryslers rate for a 60month term 
chryslers program runs indefinitely fords expires may 31 and 
gms runs out june 5 
for a customer financing a 13000 car with 1000 down meaning 
a 12000 loan the monthly payments on a twoyear loan would be 
500 under chryslers interestfree incentive and 51524 under 
ford and gms 29 percent plans a twoyear loan at 11 percent a 
common openmarket rate would be 55929 a month 
for a morecommon 48month loan a buyer of either a chrylser 
gm or ford car would pay 28680 under the 69 percent loans 
offered by the big three with a marketrate loan of 11 percent a 
48month loan would come to 316 monthly 
each of the companies acknowledged that the incentives would cut 
into their profits and bidwell said the companys earnings during 
the first six months of 1989 would be below last years levels and 
then rebound in the second half 
but automobile analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert 
inc of new york disagreed 
i think the gradual increase youve seen in sales incentives 
over the last three or four months will have a significant 
impact he said i think chryslers earnings are likely to be 
flat a few months ago i was looking for a goodsize increase 
the incentive war comes on the heels of unexpectedly low early 
1989 sales and inventories that have been causing some worry but 
no panic among automakers each of the big three automakers set 
ambitious production schedules for the first few months of this 
year and there are no largescale moves to curtail them yet 
car and light truck sales through the first 80 days of 1989 have 
been running 54 percent behind the same period last year the 
secondbest in the industrys history 
sales figures for the first quarter of the year are due out 
today the automakers are hoping that the new incentive programs 
will give sales a boost during april when they usually are strong 
as americans look forward to summer vacations and weekend driving 
trips 
interestfree financing affects only twoyear loans which in 
the past have made up about 12 percent of chrysler credit corps 
business jerry farrell president of loanmaking company said he 
expected that percentage to double with the new program 
he also said the 69 percent interest rate for 48month loans 
down from 89 percent in chryslers previous incentive program 
will attract buyers who may have been considering fiveyear notes 
chrysler unlike ford and gm has not seen a growing number of 
repossessions and loan defaults in the fiveyear loan category 
which makes up about 60 percent of the companys vehicleloan 
business 
the interestfree loan deal was well received by dealers the 
corporation talked with during the weekend said tom pappert vice 
president for sales at chrysler motors 
but the program is bound to face strong criticism from ron 
tonkin president of the national automobile dealers association 
late last week after ford and gm announced their new incentive 
programs tonkin called the incentive war a circus he urged 
automakers to get out of the matchme incentive games and lower 
the prices once and for all and guarantee the public those are the 
prices 
but bob lutz president of chrysler motors said that wont 
work rebates frequently are used to bolster the creditworthiness 
of a potential buyer by increasing their down payment he said 
we would greatly prefer to operate the way we used to operate 
lutz said monday but the reality is that isnt the world 
we live in anymore whether well ever get out of it is anybodys 
guess

thirtysix more boeing co jetliners have been 
found with crossed wiring or plumbing in firesuppression systems 
bringing the total number of boeing planes with the problems to 95 
the federal aviation administration said monday 
the 36 additions all belong to foreign carriers kirotv quoted 
the faa as saying 
faa spokesmen in seattle were not immediately reachable by 
telephone monday night to confirm the data 
as of march 10 the faa had received reports of 59 boeing planes 
with crossed wires kiro reported the problems have been found 
over the last year 
the 36 planes either had crossed plumbing lines or crossed 
wiring in the fire emergency system and most of the planes were 
built since 1981 kiro reported 
the faa early this year ordered inspections of about 740 boeing 
737s 747s 757s and 767s produced since 1981 to resolve concerns 
about crossed wiring most foreign aviation agencies ordered their 
carriers to make similar inspections 
boeing earlier confirmed that the repeated wiring mishaps have 
prompted the company to start an engineering study in an effort to 
prevent crossed wires and pipes 
two main miswiring problems can occur in the engine and cargo 
fire warning and suppression system and could interfere with the 
fire extinguishing system in planes kiro reported 
of the 95 total discrepancies 68 were wiring problems the 
station reported of that number 24 planes had wiring problems in 
the engine fire warning and suppression systems and 44 planes were 
found to have cargo fire warning and suppression systems wiring 
problems 
the other 27 discrepancies were plumbing problems which were 
all on 767s

a new york trust filed suit monday in an 
attempt to halt the sale of united artists to an australian company 
the lawsuit filed in superior court came just three days after 
qintex group proposed the purchase of the los angelesbased movie 
studio for 1 billion the biggest of a series of moves by foreign 
firms to buy hollywood companies 
the chappaqua family trust alleged that the price to be paid for 
uas assets is inadequate unfair and fraudulently determined 
investor kirk kerkorian who owns 82 percent of the companys 
stock and the tracinda corp kerkorians holding company along 
with qintex entertainment inc are named as defendants 
chappaqua family trust also alleges that ua executives were 
derelict in their duty to stockholders because the sale scheduled 
for completion on sept 30 was designed specifically to enable 
defendants kerkorian and tracinda to unfairly withdraw substantial 
value from the company and to solidify and retain control over the 
balance of the companys valuable assets 
calls to qintex offices in los angeles and to ua spokesmen after 
business hours monday were not answered 
under the deal announced friday qintex agreed to acquire all 
outstanding stock of uas parent company 
metrogoldwynmayerunited artists at 20 a share 
qintex best known in the united states as one of the makers of 
the cbs miniseries lonesome dove would get the ua moviemaking 
group and its film library 
but kerkorian would retain control of the mgm name and its tv

the citizens and southern corp is relying on a 
regulatory shield to fight an unwelcome 24 billion takeover 
attempt by the ncnb corp a merger that if completed would 
create the nations sixthlargest bank 
the board of the parent company of the atlantabased camps bank 
voted unanimously monday to reject the ncnb corp offer calling it 
inadequate and saying camps management can better serve the 
banks customers shareholders and communities than can ncnb 
the surprise bid for camps followed a push by ncnb into texas last 
year in which it bought into the republic bank corp of dallas 
the move by the charlotte ncbased corporation drove its stock 
price up 50 percent enabling ncnb to mount other takeover drives 
with stock not cash 
we have managed this bank for service growth profitability 
and longterm service to shareholders not for a quick sale camps 
chairman and chief executive officer bennett a brown said in a 
statement 
the board of directors and the management have concluded that 
this offer is clearly inadequate and not in the best interests of 
camps shareholders customers and employees he said 
in a statement monday night ncnb called its offer fair and 
generous and said its legal advisers felt there was no regulatory 
block to such an acquisition 
we are determined to proceed and request the camps board to 
reconsider our offer and promptly authorize negotiations the 
release said 
h rodgin cohen a new york lawyer specializing in bank 
takeovers said monday there is some chance ncnb corp would 
respect the wishes of the board 
cohen is acting as special counsel to camps he said camps is the 
stronger bank and that the federal reserve board has frowned upon a 
weaker bank taking over a stronger one 
he also said the government is worried about banks that grow 
radically faster than their peers along with the texas 
acquisition acquiring camps would mean ncnb would expand its size 
threefold in a year 
because of the structure of the camps board of directors he said 
ncnb could not control it until two years after a takeover and 
noted that the government had rejected mergers with similar 
problems because of potential disruptions and discord between the 
board and the majority stockholders 
ben e johnson iii a tax specialist with alston amp bird the 
atlanta law firm representing camps said the acquisition might be 
blocked at the state level because by virtue of having more than 20 
percent of its deposits in texas ncnb corp cannot be considered a 
member of the southeastern banking compact 
georgia banks cannot be sold to banks outside the compact 
he said georgia bank examiners might balk at the prospect of 
ncnb moving georgia capital from camps to texas to finance a 
speculative investment in a state outside the region 
ncnb the southeasts largest banking company surprised camps and 
financial observers thursday with its 24 billion stock offer camps 
management was cool to the idea from the start 
ncnb told camps it wanted to begin active merger discussions 
within five business days 
also monday the camps board voted to adopt a new article in the 
corporations bylaws under georgias business combination act 
preventing any major shareholders from engaging in a business 
combination for five years unless certain conditions are met the 
move could make a takeover more difficult 
a combined ncnb and camps would create a formidable bank with 76 
billion in assets ncnb officials characterized their buyout offer 
as friendly and vowed to leave camps managers and its name in 
place in georgia 
under ncnbs plan camps shareholders would get 1075 shares of 
ncnb common stock for each of their camps shares 
ncnb would have to issue about 66 million new shares to provide 
camps stockholders with the 24 billion

gov rudy perpich and other minnesota 
officials are pursuing a number of options aimed at thwarting a 
takeover of northwest airlines a move they see as a threat to the 
states economy 
theyre in for one hell of a fight house speaker robert 
vanasek said monday of two groups that have proposed buying 
northwests parent company nwa inc which is based in suburban 
eagan 
investor marvin davis has offered to buy nwa for 262 billion 
or 90 a share davis owns 3 percent of nwas 291 million shares 
a second unidentified group of investors that owns 49 percent of 
the stock also is interested in buying the company nwa says 
nwa stock closed down 50 cents monday at 8437 a share on the 
new york stock exchange 
vanasek was among the legislative leaders and constitutional 
officers from both political parties union officials and others 
who pledged at a news conference to back perpich in what he has 
described as an allout war against a hostile takeover of the 
nations fourthlargest carrier and one of the states largest 
employers 
nwa has indicated its board will review the davis offer which 
he insists is friendly but the company has said it intends to 
remain independent 
the airline has not asked for state assistance state officials 
have said but unionized machinists pilots and flight attendants 
have asked the state to help ensure that northwest remains an 
independent company and that minneapolisst paul international 
airport remains a northwest hub state commerce commissioner 
michael hatch said 
the democratic governor said the following actions are being 
taken 
us rep james oberstar dminn who chairs a house aviation 
subcommittee assured state officials that he will conduct a 
hearing to investigate the financial background of any major 
investor involved in a potential northwest takeover such an 
investigation perpich said would be aimed at ensuring the 
investor had the financial capability to operate northwest 
airlines in the professional manner on which the economy of 
minnesota depends 
members of the minnesota congressional delegation are being 
asked to develop an antitakeover strategy at the federal level 
the us justice and transportation departments will be asked 
to thoroughly review any proposed sale 
legislation that would grant the minnesota commerce 
commissioner authority to approve a change of ownership of a 
corporation that occupies a controlling market share of any segment 
of the transportation industry is being researched for possible 
introduction in the state legislature 
the state attorney generals office is looking into the 
possible anticompetitive effects of a takeover of northwest and 
legal remedies available to the state 
legislative leaders are looking into possible legislative 
proposals aimed at protecting state workers and state public 
investment in the event of a buyout 
asked which items on the list might thwart a takeover perpich 
said we dont know but were going to explore every possible 
avenue 
industry analysts said it was unclear what if anything state 
officials could do to block a takeover 
it makes total sense for them to do what they can but how 
much of an impact can they have asked kurt rivard of 
minneapolisbased dain bosworth inc 
if davis upholds his promise of expanding the airline and 
keeping its headquarters in eagan the state would be worse off by 
blocking a takeover said louis marckesano an airline analyst for 
janney montgomery scott inc of philadelphia 
no management should be entrenched to the exclusion of a 
sale marckesano said 
the legislature moved swiftly in june 1987 to block the 
threatened hostile takeover of minneapolisbased dayton hudson 
corp by dart group corp by passing antitakeover legislation but 
the law does not affect nwa which is chartered in delaware 
the antitakeover legislation played a role in the defense of 
dayton hudson but the october 1987 stock market crash which 
slashed millions of dollars from the value of darts holdings is 
largely credited with saving the company from takeover 
analysts have warned that a takeover of northwest would almost 
certainly result in the firing of some of the companys 35000 
employees 
northwest has about 17000 employees in minnesota perpich said 
an additional 70000 minnesotans whose livelihood depends on the 
airline operation also would be affected by a takeover 
mondays wall street journal suggested that nwa could defend 
itself from takeover bids by issuing a special dividend to 
shareholders nwa could easily raise money for a special dividend 
analysts told the newspaper because it owns 73 percent of its 
aircraft fleet the second highest percentage of the eight major 
us airlines nwa could sell the planes and lease them back

columbia savings amp loan association 
confirmed that federal investigators are examining whether it 
engaged in illegal trading with the highyield bond department at 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
the thrift has given cartons of documents to the us 
attorneys office in new york and the securities and exchange 
commission said kenneth r heitz columbias executive vice 
president and general counsel 
some columbia employees have been subpoenaed to appear before a 
new york grand jury investigating criminal allegations against 
drexel he said 
however drexel which already has agreed to plead guilty to six 
violations of securities fraud laws said in a prepared statement 
that it was confident no wrongdoing involving columbia had occurred 
columbia savings amp loan association has been one of the 
largest customers of the drexel burnham lambert highyield bond 
department and we continue to have an important business 
relationship with that group the company said 
like virtually every important customer of drexels highyield 
bond group columbia has produced to the sec and the us attorney 
its entire trading records with drexel for the past five to 
sevenyear period 
the los angeles times quoting unnamed sources reported today 
that at least one drexel employee gave testimony several ome months 
ago to the grand jury about drexels dealings with columbia 
columbia has grown rapidly and earned large profits by using 
deposits to invest heavily in the highrisk highyield junk bonds 
columbias chief executive thomas spiegel has been described 
as a close business associate of michael milken head of drexels 
beverly hillsbased highyield bond department until his indictment 
last week 
milken his brother lowell milken and former drexel trader 
bruce l newberg were charged with racketeering and securities 
fraud in a 98count federal criminal indictment that had been 
expected for months 
heitz declined to say who had been subpoenaed but said spiegel 
was not among those called before the grand jury 
columbia said it conducted its own internal inquiry into trading 
with drexel 
we have found nothing which indicates that any of the trading 
activity between the two companies is anything other than normal 
arms length business transactions the company said

lockheed corp announced the creation 
of a 500 million employee stock ownership plan today one day 
after an investor group said it held a 53 percent stake in the 
aerospace company 
lockheed said it would issue 105 million new shares for its 
employee stock ownership plan known as an esop then buy back the 
same number of shares on the open market the buyback was intended 
to offset the dilutive effects of the plan on the companys 
oustanding stock lockheed said 
many companies have used esops as defensive moves against 
hostile takeover attempts last month polaroid corp defeated an 
unwanted bid from shamrock holdings inc with an esop as part of 
its defensive strategy 
we dont deny it has defensive characteristics but that was 
not the primary purpose for the esop lockheed spokesman bob 
slayman said today the primary purpose is to create employee 
incentive tied to shareholder growth and value 
on monday dallas investor harold c simmons disclosed that his 
group valhi inc has a 53 percent stake in lockheed but slayman 
said today that the esop had been under consideration here for 
some time 
simmons said his groups stake in lockheed bodes no takeover 
attempt of the aerospace giant a company he said is running just 
fine as it is 
the company has taken defensive steps against simmons in the 
past when valhi said last december it wanted to increase its 
holdings to more than 15 million lockheed said it was 
implementing a poison pill shareholder rights plan 
the plan would allow current shareholders to buy newly issued 
stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the 
common stock the effect would be to make it much more expensive 
for someone to take over the company 
in december valhi owned 063 percent of lockheeds 595 million 
outstanding shares 
in midday trading on the new york stock exchange today lockheed 
fell 875 cents to 4887 a share after a delayed opening the 
stock rose 3 a share on monday 
lockheed also announced steps today to help reduce its costs 
the company said it would phase out its information systems 
group and sell the groups four units no asking price was given 
lockheed also said it would sell real estate in burbank calif 
made available by the ongoing relocation of its aeronautical 
systems division to sites in california and georgia the company 
said its was accelerating the relocation to take advantage of what 
it called more efficient facilities 
these steps and the esop will enhance our competitiveness in a 
rapidly changing environment where premiums are placed on 
innovation efficientcy quality and focused management lockheed 
chairman daniel m tellup said 
simmons said in a telephone interview monday he did not intend 
to try to take over the aerospace giant which produces the secret 
f117a stealth fighter and is home to the famed skunk works 
the advanced development project area at lockheeds burbank plant 
where such innovations as the p80 the nations first fighter jet 
and the highflying u2 and sr71 spy planes were developed 
simmons said he might sell some of his stock if it rises another 
3 he said he had not considered how many shares of lockheed he 
might buy 
we view lockheed as a wellmanaged company simmons said in 
a friday letter to lockheed management a copy of which he released 
monday we have no plans or desire to disrupt management we 
expect to be a constructive longterm shareholder 
simmons said he is investing in lockheed because he believes its 
stock was undervalued late last year due to anticipated cuts in the 
federal defense budget lockheed share prices were at 39 and 
averaged into the low 40s when he began acquiring them he said 
in february lockheed reported profit from continuing operations 
rose 35 percent in 1988 but profit rose 48 percent if proceeds of 
the sale of its dialog computerized information services were 
included 
lockheed said it earned 624 million or 1037 a share in 
1988 up from 421 million or 641 a share the previous year 
that profit was boosted 182 by the sale of dialog 
lockheed defense projects include the radarevading stealth 
fighter the trident 11 nuclear missile the c5b transport plane 
and work on military communications satellites and the strategic 
defense initiative or star wars the company is also a 
subcontractor for design work on nasas space station project

brothel are on sale in its home state 
seven weeks after the securities and exchange commission 
approved the initial offering of stock in the mustang ranch the 
nevada securities division permitted the sale of a limited amount 
of the issue on monday according to judith allan education and 
research coordinator for the agency 
allan said the division approved sales of 350000 worth of the 
233 million offering after receiving a 300 filing fee and a 
supplemental prospectus it had requested from the company making 
the offer that detailed potential risks to investors 
she said the remaining 23 million of the stock offer was 
expected to be authorized once the state received an additional 
2130 filing fee

will start in april 1990 
it will be a great challenge taking a business curriculum 
designed for a market economy and western culture and to use that 
as a framework to educate a current generation in a centrally 
engineered economy that is becoming more marketoriented 
molander said 
soviet educational and business systems differ greatly from 
those in the united states so the portland state program will be 
adjusted to the soviets economic system while retaining basic 
features like accounting management communication and marketing 
molander said 
some concepts however dont translate easily he said the 
term marketing had to be adopted straight from english into the 
russian vocabulary because there was no russian equivalent

consolidated gold fields plc on tuesday unveiled a 
novel defense against a hostile bid from minorco sa promisibv to 
pay its shareholders 22 billion in dividends if it doesnt meet 
its own profit forecast 
south africanbased minorco whose offer values all of the 
british mining group at about 54 billion is trying to overturn a 
us court decision that threatens the bid it would be britains 
biggest takeover ever 
a preliminary injunction arising from a us antitrust suit 
against minorco blocks it from buying more than 30 percent of gold 
fields shares the mining investment concern currently owns 296 
percent of gold fields 
analysts generally expect luxembourgbased minorco to raise its 
bid from its current cash and stock offer of 2375 a share 
gold fields shares rose 43 cents to finish at 2292 on londons 
stock exchange tuesday minorcos shares fell 19 cents to 1263 
gold fields guaranteed shareholders more than 20 percent average 
annual compound growth in earnings per share over the three years 
ending in june 1992 if its target of 680 in cumulative earnings 
per chare isnt met by the end of the 1992 fiscal year then 
shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of 1020 per 
share it said 
gold fields has about 213 million shares outstanding 
no british company has ever committed itself so firmly to 
value for its shareholders said chairman rudolph agnew gold 
fields has both the assets and the management to see off minorco 
for good and our performance pledge is designed to ensure both 
value todayand value tomorrow for all our shareholders 
quite a major scheme of corporate restructuring would be 
necessary to pay the special dividend a company spokesman said 
this could involve such moves as a stock offering of part of gold 
fields highly profitable arc construction aggregates business or 
of its usbased gold fields mining corp said the spokesman who 
wasnt identified in accordance with british custom 
the spokesman added there werent any immediate plans for sales 
the special dividend payment would require approval of a 
resolution by 51 percent of the shareholders authorizing the 
company to issue special preferred stock free to existing holders 
on a oneforone basis 
its a phenomenal growth rate for any company to admit to 
said john willis an analyst at yamaichi international europe 
ltd its a very very clever move by gold fields in its bid 
defense 
the move could help determine the outcome of the takeover 
battle willis said institutional shareholders in gold fields 
many of whom are already flush with cash might reject minorcos 
offer in favor of a guaranteed realization of their gains over the 
next three years willis said 
minorco said gold fields latest defense wasnt relevant to the 
takeover bid and will have no impact on our thinking

congress should write a 1990 farm bill on the 
assumption that the european economic community will block any 
chance of substantive progress for easing world agricultural trade 
restrictions a us farm leader said tuesday 
dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation 
said the new legislation should continue the current export 
enhancement program which subsidizes the export sale of certain 
us agricultural commodities particularly those that must compete 
with subsidized eec farm products 
the bush administration wants to see the outcome of the current 
uruguay round of talks under the general agreement of tariffs and 
trade before there is a new farm bill the current law passed in 
1985 will expire next year 
some want the 1985 law extended a year or two so that any gatt 
settlement can be considered as new legislation is drafted 
i dont think we should write a farm bill based on what we 
hope will happen in the gatt talks kleckner told a news 
conference 
the united states and the 12nation eec are hung up mainly on 
longterm strategy and by what us negotiators insist are 
distortions caused by certain subsidies and restrictive policies 
but eec officials claim there has been progress in overhauling 
the communitys policies and that the united states should 
compromise on some of its goals which at one time called for the 
gradual elimination of tradedistorting farm subsidies and rules 
negotiations resume wednesday in geneva under gatt auspices 
meanwhile us and eec officials say they have agreed on 
progressive substantial reductions in agricultural subsidies a 
phrase kleckner said he doesnt understand at this point 
asked about eec claims of already making progress in scaling 
back some of its agricultural programs kleckner said he couldnt 
see those actions have amounted to much 
in the total context of world trade it really hasnt been 
anything at all he said and it hasnt done anything 
longterm 
kleckner said the europeans must make changes if we are to 
move toward more rational world agricultural trade but that the 
eec refuses to entertain that notion 
although kleckner said he was not giving up yet on the uruguay 
round of negotiations it has about two years still remaining he 
said there is some danger of agricultural issues taking a back seat 
to other trade matters 
one of the reasons agriculture got attention when the current 
round began in punta del este uruguay on sept 20 1986 was the 
skyrocketing costs of government farm programs operated by many 
countries including the eec and united states kleckner said food 
costs also were rising in some countries 
but farm program costs have come down partly as a result of 
higher commodity prices fueled by last years north american 
drought and lower support prices ordered by the united states 
under the 1985 farm law 
theres no question that last years drought and the resulting 
higher commodity prices around the world took the pressure out of 
agricultural talks in this round kleckner said but droughts 
are temporary they come and go and so the longterm problem is 
still out there

crossed wiring or plumbing problems in fire 
warning and extinguishing systems have been found on 94 boeing 
jetliners the federal aviation administration said today 
the faa said none of the problems directly affected the planes 
airworthiness and all were corrected before the aircraft returned 
to service 
on jan 31 the faa issued an airworthiness directive ordering 
us operators of boeing jets to inspect for possible wiring or 
plumbing problems in fire warning and suppression systems in 
aircraft engines and cargo holds 
the directive was prompted by the discovery of 32 such problems 
in previous checks of boeing planes 
only us operators were required to make the checks but many 
foreign carriers followed suit voluntarily the faa said that of 
the 63 problems found since the directive was issued 36 were 
reported since the last update on march 10 six were found on us 
aircraft and 57 on foreign planes two problems were found on one 
aircraft faa spokesman david duff said 
duff said the names of the foreign carriers would not be 
released because they reported voluntarily and because we feel 
that would hinder the future flow of information 
however air canada has said it found wiring problems on two of 
its 767s australian airlines reported wrong connections on fire 
extinguisher bottles on four of its 737s and japanese television 
network nhk reported last month that problems were found on 19 747s 
and 767s operated by japan air lines and all nippon airways 
at the time of the march 10 faa update boeing co officials 
said they had found an engineering solution to prevent wiring 
problems and were awaiting faa approval for it 
boeing commercial airplanes spokesman craig martin said today 
the engineering changes were undergoing final review at boeing 
before submission to the faa for its approval he said the changes 
involve the wiring and plumbing connectors to physically 
differentiate the connectors so it will be much more difficult to 
connect them improperly 
the initial crossconnection problems were reported about a year 
ago since then boeing has made a lot of progress looking at our 
assembly procedures in the factory and the functional tests in the 
factories martin said 
boeing also is examining its maintenance manuals to see if 
instructions need to be clarified and whether there is a need to 
test the extinguisher and warning system functions when maintenance 
is carried out he said 
martin said in the vast majority of the problems reported 
the fire suppression systems still worked both the cargo hold and 
engine fire extinguisher systems have backups 
the faa said today that 19 of the 63 problems were found in the 
engine fire warning and supression systems of those 10 were found 
on 737300s and 737400s three on 767s five on 757s and one on a 
747 
fortyfour problems were found in cargo compartment fire warning 
and extinguishing systems including 30 on 747s one on a 757 and 
13 on 767s 
the 32 problems found before the jan 31 directive was issued 
involved 12 us and 20 foreign aircraft eight of those involved 
engine systems including four on 737300s and 737400s three on 
757s and one on a 747 the remaining 24 involved cargo hold 
systems seven on 757s and 17 on 767s 
the faa said that of the total 95 problems 68 concerned wiring 
with 24 such problems in engines and 44 in cargo compartments the 
remaining 27 were fire extinguisher plumbing problems with three 
in engines and 24 in cargo compartments all the plumbing problems 
were on 767s

the internal revenue service already cutting 
activities is likely to face another squeeze next year because 
president bushs irs budget includes no money to enforce a new 
antidrug law and the taxpayer bill of rights government 
auditors said tuesday 
we question whether the administration has properly reflected 
what irs will need to assure adequate funding of its ongoing 
activities in fiscal year 1990 jennie stathis an associate 
director of the general accounting office told a house ways and 
means subcommittee 
this budget is a real friend of the deadbeats said rep 
byron dorgan dnd a member of the oversight subcommittee the 
folks who dont meet their tax obligations are going to experience 
a diminished threat with fewer irs auditors and collectors 
dorgan said 
he noted that while the budget would require a reduction in the 
number of tax auditors it anticipates fewer auditors will produce 
more revenue 
there is nothing in the new budget to help the irs deal with the 
new drug law the bill of rights which is designed to help 
taxpayers involved in disputes with the irs or a new tax to 
finance catastrophicillness protection for older americans said 
michael j murphy acting commissioner of internal revenue 
when the agency outlined its needs for the coming year irs 
asked that its budget be increased by 13 billion in part to 
reflect increased responsibilities under the new laws that 
increase was scaled back by the white house office of management 
and budget which instead approved a raise of 289 million to 
55 billion 
i feel the 1990 budget does step us forward in tax 
administration despite some shortcomings murphy told the 
subcommittee but in the meantime he added we are dealing with 
treasury and look forward to working with omb to resolve those 
differences 
ms stathis said that although the budget for the current year 
is 360 million less than irs needs irs is functioning so far 
without any significant disruption to its basic operations we are 
uncertain however what lies in store for the rest of 1989 
in scaling back operations the irs vowed not to reduce 
assistance to taxpayers or slow processing of returns the agency 
is reducing travel training and purchases of computers and 
supplies a hiring freeze was imposed for most occupations 
robert m tobias president of the national treasury employees 
union which represents most irs workers said irs enforcement has 
suffered to the extent that in just six months the government has 
lost 1 billion in revenues that it otherwise would have collected 
another 1 billion will be lost by october unless the irs is given 
more money he added 
this years squeeze was caused gao said because of a mandated 
41 percent increase in employee pay higher postal rates and a 
rise in premiums for workers health insurance and pensions 
gao an arm of congress said the irs budget for next year is 
suspect because it fails to include some costs including the 
antidrug law and the taxpayer bill of rights while anticipating 
savings that are questionable the latter was a reference to omb 
projections that the irs can save a considerable amount of money by 
having private contractors rather than federal workers do certain 
jobs

but wheat prices were down at the close tuesday on the chicago 
board of trade

several sessions 
people walked in this morning and said it had been oversold 
and there was some european trade in the soymeal market said 
assistant vice president cathy leow of thompson mckinnon securities 
inc

mondays closing rally and the lack of confirmation of rumors 
concerning a big sale to china research director jerry gidel of 
lit america inc said

tons of corn to the soviet union he added

stock prices pulled back slightly today as the 
market relinguished some of the gains from mondays moderate 
advance 
analysts said in the early going trading lacked direction due to 
the absence of any new developments on the economic or takeover 
fronts and the market meandered in a narrow range 
as the session continued weakness in technology issues weighed 
down the market and share prices headed down 
jack barbanel a senior vice president at gruntal amp co inc 
said buying in the stock market subsided today with traders sorting 
through a range of previously disclosed takeover news 
the market seems to be in somewhat of a holding pattern 
said barbanel adding that wall street may remain subdued this week 
awaiting fridays release of us employment statistics 
the labor departments employment report for march will furnish 
a fresh indication of how much the economy is responding to the 
federal reserves efforts to slow growth and diffuse inflationary 
pressures

the bush administrations third world debt 
initiative won key endorsements tuesday from the two international 
agencies expected to implement the strategy with officials from 
both groups pledging quick action to get debt relief underway 
both michel camdessus the managing director of the 151nation 
international monetary fund and barber conable president of the 
other global lending organization the world bank said they 
recognized the need for urgency in addressing the debt crisis 
conable said that any delay could be devastating in view of 
the expectancies which have been created about the prospect for a 
reduction in the 13 trillion level of third world debt 
in a speech to the final session of the spring meetings of the 
imf and the world bank conable said the bank had created a joint 
task force to work with the imf to speed implementation of the new 
debt relief program 
earlier the top policy board of the imf issued a communique 
endorsing the general principles embodied in the debt program 
unveiled by treasury secretary nicholas brady on march 10 
the approval was seen as critical since the administration is 
counting on most of the financing for the debt relief scheme to 
come from the two lending agencies the brady plan seeks to resolve 
the debt crisis by encouraging commercial banks to cancel 
voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to third world 
countries in return for assurances from the imf and world bank of 
repayment on the remaining debt 
the administration projects cutting the debt of 39 major debtor 
nations by 20 percent over the next three years with financing of 
about 12 billion each from the imf and the world bank 
imf and world bank officials refused to discuss specific dollar 
amounts on tuesday saying that much will depend on how many 
countries adopt the economic reforms which will be necessary to 
qualify for the debt relief 
a us treasury department official who spoke on condition that 
his name not be used said it was likely that the philippines would 
be the first country to qualify for debt relief mexico and 
venezuela also have been mentioned as early candidates for 
assistance 
camdessus told reporters at a briefing that the imf recognized 
the need to move quickly to spell out just how the debt relief will 
work in order to remove uncertainty in ongoing negotiations 
between debtor countries and creditors 
nothing is worse than uncertainty he said the sooner we 
can assemble a program and provide answers the better the chance 
for success 
one reason for urgency is the growing political turmoil in many 
emerging democracies in latin america stemming from the debt burden 
and the stagnation in living standards in the region riots left at 
least 270 dead in venezuela in february after the government 
imposed new debt austerity measures 
the spring meetings of the imf and world bank had been 
considered a critical launching pad for the new brady plan brady 
laid the groundwork for approval by gaining the endorsement of the 
leading industrial countries for the debt relief strategy at a 
daylong negotiating session on sunday 
the statement by the imf interim committee contained much of the 
same language as the sunday communique issued by the united states 
japan west germany france britain canada and italy 
in another favorable development this week japan pledged to 
loan up to 45 billion to developing nations over the next several 
years a commitment that is viewed as critical since the flow of 
commercial bank lending has been drying up 
the administration did not get everything it sought the imf 
steering group because of objections from the british in 
particular refused to endorse a us proposal to use imf and world 
bank funds to guarantee interest payments on the debt as well as 
the reduced amounts of principal 
the british and some other countries had objected that the more 
costly interestrate guarantees represented little more than a 
bailout to commercial banks who had made the loans 
the imf steering group promised to examine the question of 
interest rate subsidies dutch finance minister h onno ruding 
chairman of the imf steering committee said that the language of 
the final statement did not mean the idea was dead only that the 
finance ministers needed to know more details of how such 
guarantees would work 
brady in a speech prepared for the closing session of the joint 
imfworld bank development committee said the administration would 
continue pushing for guarantees on both the reduced debt and the 
interest payments 
we believe it is essential to establish both support 
mechanisms in order to provide adequate impetus for the banks to 
cancel a portion of the debt brady said 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy told reporters that the 
venezuelan riots had been an alarm signal showing more needed 
to be done to address the 7yearold debt crisis he predicted the 
debt issue would be a prime topic on the agenda when president bush 
attends his first economic summit in paris in july

oil prices headed higher in brisk trading 
tuesday with crude rising above the 20abarrel level and 
unleaded gasoline gaining more than a penny a gallon 
analysts attributed the rally to a variety of factors including 
expectations of a bullish weekly trade report on oil supplies due 
to the alaskan oil spill and bargaining hunting following mondays 
partial selloff 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude settled 47 
cents higher tuesday at 2042 a barrel the contract had lost 24

may wholesale home heating oil which lost 062 cent at the 
start of the week settled at 5364 cents up 089 cent 
andrew lebow an energy analyst with edf man international 
futures inc said traders were anticipating a dropoff in oil 
supplies when the american petroleum institute releases its latest 
weekly report 
most traders expect sharp drawdowns in crude inventory due to 
the alaskan situation he said 
oil prices have risen sharply since a massive oil spill by an 
exxon corp tanker at the valdez alaska port the alaskan 
pipeline there carries nearly onequarter of the united states 
domestic supply of crude oil 
adding support to the market tuesday lebow said were reports 
that the us coast guard would continue to restrict tanker 
activity at valdez

the federal communications commission on 
tuesday said it would not stand in the way of british 
telecommunications incs 15 billion investment in mccaw cellular 
communications inc the nations biggest cellular phone company 
the fcc said the purchase of a 224 percent share of mccaw did 
not involve a transfer of control of mccaw to british telecom usa 
and it also was in line with federal restrictions on foreign 
involvement in us broadcasting or common carrier companies 
gerald brock chief of the fccs common carrier bureau said the 
1934 communications act limits foreign stakes in us 
communications companies to either 20 percent or 25 percent 
depending on whether the us concern has direct or indirect 
control of broadcast licenses 
he said mccaw does not hold licenses directly but rather 
controls them through wholly owned subsidiaries thus he said the 
25 percent limit applies 
british telecom will gain control of four of the 19 seats on 
mccaws board and acquire 224 percent of its stock 
the deal is the largest yet for the fledgling cellular industry 
according to the cellular telecommunications industry association 
the ctia said mccaw was cashstrapped and had reported net 
losses of 922 million in the quarter ended dec 31 1988 
the mccaw family and management holds a 41 percent equity in the 
company and board chairman craig mccaw will maintain majority 
control of electing directors brock said 
mccaw owns subsidiaries which in turn hold interests in 
cellular paging and other areas of radio communications 
british telecom usa is the wholly owned subsidiary of british 
telecom a publicly held corporation that is 49 percent owned by 
the british government

a connecticut investment broker allegedly bilked 
his clients out of more than 15 million by keeping their money 
for his personal use rather than investing it federal authorities 
charged tuesday 
according to a complaint filed in us district court in 
manhattan by the securities and exchange commission the broker 
william s hoglund 47 of greenwich conn told relatives 
friends and others that investments he would make on their behalf 
would be low risk liquid and highly lucrative 
however the sec said in a scheme that began in december 1986 
hoglund made few investments and instead deposited his clients 
money into three accounts he kept at citibank 
at least 22 investors residing in four states invested about 
18 million with hoglund the sec refused to name the states 
according to court papers after persistent requests or 
lawsuits hoglund returned about 250000 to several investors 
however investors have been unable to get approximately 1560000 
from hoglund 
investors found it difficult and sometimes impossible to get 
all or part of their investments back hoglund evaded deceived and 
made misrepresentations to investors regarding the return of their 
funds the complaint said 
hoglunds attorney joel m lutwin said his client would have 
no comment on the sec complaint 
however according to the court papers hoglund told a meeting 
of his clients in november 1987 that he had not invested their 
money as promised 
us district judge thomas p griesa issued a temporary 
restraining order on tuesday freezing hoglunds assets and ordering 
him to stop accepting money from investors griesa scheduled a 
hearing on the matter for april 14

the bush administration said tuesday it would 
oppose any move to close the alaska pipeline but acknowledged it 
was unclear whether the federal government has legal authority to 
prevent it 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the authority 
issue was an open question however he said i dont 
honestly believe anybody wants to close the pipeline 
environmental protection administrator william reilly 
meanwhile told congress that the massive alaskan oil spill could 
put the brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas 
at least temporarily 
we will take apart the environmental planning for every aspect 
of oil development in alaska and in other sensitive areas where the 
environment potentially could be threatened reilly told a house 
appropriations subcommittee 
alaska gov steve cowper has threatened to shut the pipeline 
unless exxon and other oil companies produce a better plan to deal 
with oil spills such as the one that dumped 10million gallons in 
prince william sound on march 24 democratic and republican state 
legislators have backed up cowper 
at the white house fitzwater said weve seen those comments 
by cowper but we simply dont think it would be in the national 
interest to close the pipeline 
we need to be aware of environmental precautions and 
safeguards that can and should be taken as a result of this 
incident but we remind people that the pipeline supplies 25 percent 
of our daily domestic oil production or oneeighth of our daily 
consumption fitzwater said 
and while we share his environmental concerns we would not 
anticipate closing the pipeline 
the press secretary said no consideration had been given to the 
idea of bush going to alaska for a firsthand look at the 
environmental damage from the spill 
reilly assured congress the administration will thoroughly 
review environmental safeguards in areas under consideration for 
oil exploration 
we are doing that as you know off the coast of california 
and the coast of florida well do it in prince william sound 
and look very carefully at future contingency planning there and 
well do it on the north slope he said 
i think we owe that to the environment reilly added we owe 
that to common sense 
asked if the administration would hold up exploration of the 
arctic national wildlife refuge pending completion of the review 
reilly said there is a very clear understanding that we will not 
move forward if we have any significant concerns that have not been 
resolved 
reilly was called to testify before the house appropriations 
subcommittee on independent agencies about the epas budget but the 
committee first grilled him about the alaska oil spill 
acknowledging a lack of adequate precautions for such an 
accident reilly said the contingency plan itself was not 
adequate to anticipate contemplate prepare for and respond to a 
spill of this magnitude it was not 
theres no question about that but the response was not 
adequate either he said 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said tuesday he has asked bush 
to assign administration officials to gather scientific information 
from other countries that have experienced large oil spills so 
residents of valdez know what to expect in the future 
in another indication of the economic impact the spill will have 
on fisherman murkowski said japanese buyers of alaskan seafood 
have said they will not make purchases this year from the prince 
william area 
earlier alaskan officials announced that the herring fishing 
season in the sound would be cancelled this year 
senate majority leader george mitchell meanwhile criticized 
bush for choosing to not impose a federal takeover on the cleanup 
he also introduced legislation that would require the government to 
clean up oil spills unless the company involved was doing an 
effective job of dealing with the accident 
within a few days after the spill occurred it was clear that 
the cleanup effort was inadequate mitchell said valuable 
time the most valuable time was lost 
in other legislative action sen frank lautenberg dnj 
introduced a bill that would give the coast guard access to the 
federal national driver register so that it can check the driving 
records of prospective oil tanker pilots for drunk driving 
convictions exxon valdez capt joseph hazelwood was fired and 
charged with being drunk at the time of the accident

exxon crews tuesday finished pumping the 
remaining crude oil out of the tanker exxon valdez in preparation 
for refloating and removing the source of the nations worstever 
oil spill 
the fugitive captain of the exxon valdez sent signals he was 
ready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel 
while drunk 
meanwhile exxon said placing an oilcatching boom around the 
ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant 
explosion of gases from the oil although that was not the reason 
it took 11 hours to set the first containment line 
the worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom 
the vessel we would have lost the vessel said exxon shipping 
co president frank iarossi 
a boom wasnt placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it 
wasnt available in valdez exxon officials have said 
iarossi also said exxon has changed its policy because of the 
spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship where drinking is 
prohibited four hours before sailing authorities charged the 
captain had been drinking before the valdez sailed 
thick oil has floated over more than 1640 square miles and 
soiled 800 miles of beach thousands of animals are known dead 
including 30 sea otters 
early tuesday exxon said it had finished transferring about 42 
million gallons of crude to three other ships another 42 million 
gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the valdez which 
spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into prince william 
sound when it struck a reef march 24 
the company said crews would attempt to pump air into the hold 
and refloat the vessel off a reef at high tide wednesday afternoon 
if freed the stillleaking ship which has eight holes some 20 
feet long in its hull will be towed to a remote and already fouled 
cove for repairs 
exxon then planned to take the ship to a port in the far east 
or to a portland ore dry dock port officials there said they 
werent sure if theyd allow that even though the 12 million 
repair bill would provide about 200 jobs 
were not willing to trade in the environment for jobs 
portland port spokesman darrel buttice said monday 
oregon gov neil goldschmidt said tuesday there are a lot of 
questions that need to be answered before the valdez is allowed 
in 
canadian authorities also asked exxon for assurances there will 
be no damage to the british columbia coast if the tanker is towed 
to oregon and the mayor of valdez said the ship was not welcome 
back in the port where it took on the load of crude 
in washington environmental protection administrator william 
reilly said the spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration 
there and in other areas we will take apart the environmental 
planning for every aspect of oil development in alaska and in other 
sensitive areas where the environment potentially could be 
threatened he told a house appropriations subcommittee 
the family of the fired exxon valdez captain joseph hazelwood 
said the skipper wants to surrender but is awaiting advice from his 
attorney according to lt thomas fazio commander of the new york 
state police on long island 
but after long island law enforcement authorities waited a 
second day for hazelwood to turn himself in the suffolk county 
district attorneys office announced there would be no surrender 
that day 
hazelwood 42 is accused operating the ship while under the 
influence of alcohol reckless endangerment and negligent discharge 
of oil bail was previously set in valdez at 50000 
of about three dozen oilsoaked otters rescued following the 
spill about onethird have died alaska department of fish and 
game spokesman jon lyman said dozens of otters are dying before 
rescuers can get to them he said six otters were flown to sea 
world in san diego on monday for rehabilitation 
fishermen counting on the sounds 12 million annual herring 
industry were told monday by the state that it will not allow a 
season this year sablefish and shrimp fisheries in prince william 
waters also have been closed 
an effort at sawmill bay 11 miles west of valdez to keep oil 
away from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be 
released to the sea appeared to be failing tendrils of oil had 
floated past a boom streched across the bay said officials 
the spill has shifted public opinion in alaska about the energy 
industry which has been lobbying for new exploration 
us sen frank murkowski a champion of oil exploration in 
alaska asked that plans for drilling in bristol bay the states 
richest fishing grounds be set aside until the industry can 
demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills 
the exxon valdez accident has taught us that simply having a 
plan is not sufficient the alaska republican said 
at the first valdez city council meeting since the spill two 
council members and mayor john devens expressed concern that anger 
and frustration over the spill was surfacing as harrassment of 
pipeline company workers and their children 
meanwhile a multimilliondollar classaction lawsuit was filed 
monday in federal court in california against exxon corp charging 
that the spill has led to gas prices of 10 to 15 cents more a 
gallon for california drivers

oil flow through the transalaska pipeline 
was increased again tuesday and will return to its normal daily 
level of 21 million barrels wednesday alyeska pipeline service 
co said 
flow through the pipeline had been cut by 60 percent because of 
restrictions on tanker travel through valdez harbor after the exxon 
valdez accident 
alyeska spokeswoman beverly michaels said tankers may now handle 
the normal load even though some coast guard travel restrictions 
are still in effect 
inventory is very low so we still have storage in valdez to 
handle it ms michaels said and we are able to bring in 
enough tankers 
the coast guard on monday restricted traffic to daytime hours 
only and required a twotug escort for tankers in addition only 
one tanker at a time is allowed to pass through the area 
valdez is the only port from which north slope oil is shipped 
the reductions have caused west coast refinery shortages and higher 
oil prices 
the coast guard said valdez averages three tankers a day and 
were not too far away from that

the federal judge overseeing the eastern 
airlines bankruptcy case ordered the us trustee in the case late 
tuesday to show cause why he has postponed the appointment of a 
bankruptcy examiner 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland ordered us trustee harold 
jones to explain at a hearing wednesday why jones postponed the 
naming of an examiner tuesday at the request of eastern and a 
committee representing its unsecured creditors 
the order was highly unusual for a bankruptcy case said nancy 
lazar liflands law clerk 
lifland who is overseeing easterns chapter 11 reorganization 
recently ordered appointment of an examiner with unusually broad 
powers including a mandate to mediate the bitter labor dispute at 
the carrier in an effort to get it flying again 
jones who is responsible for administration of the eastern 
bankruptcy case declined to say in a telephone interview earlier 
tuesday why the company and creditors had asked for a deferral of 
the examiner appointment 
however union sources speculated that eastern and the committee 
wished to postpone the appointment until us district judge edward 
b davis in miami rules on easterns request that he declare a 
walkout by its pilots an illegal strike and order them back to 
work davis decision is expected sometime this week 
the pilots walkout in support of a machinists strike that began 
march 4 has been crucial to the success of the strike and has 
forced the airline to sharply curtail its flight schedules 
easterns flight attendants union also is honoring the strike 
jones had said the naming of an examiner to be appointed by 
lifland could be made wednesday or later he was unavailable for 
comment late tuesday after the judge issued his order 
miamibased eastern filed for bankruptcy protection in the new 
york court on march 9 due to a cash crisis created by the strike 
jones said substantial progress was made at a meeting 
tuesday between eastern and the 15member unsecured creditors 
committee which also includes representatives of easterns pilots 
and machinists unions and its nonunion workers but he declined to 
elaborate 
the creditors committee had requested potential buyers for 
eastern including hotel executive jay pritzker and a group led by 
exbaseball commissioner peter ueberroth to present their 
proposals at its tuesday meeting 
little was immediately known of developments at the closeddoor 
creditors committee meeting at a manhattan law firm lifland had 
asked members of the committee not to discuss developments at the 
meeting with the news media according to people familiar with the 
proceedings who asked not to be identified 
the ueberroth group made a 464 million bid to acquire eastern 
but withdrew it last week after the airlines parent texas air 
corp indicated it had received a higher offer 
the group planned a revised lower offer that reflecting 
developer donald trumps new agreement to buy easterns prized 
northeast shuttle for 365 million sources close to ueberroth said 
pritzker former head of braniff airlines has offered around 
500 million for the whole airline according to sources close to 
the situation 
america west airlines which has expressed is interested in 
buying boeing 757s and the shuttles landing slots in new york and 
washington from eastern said it still considers itself a potential 
buyer 
the regional airline is not in discussions with eastern but it 
is watching developments closely said daphne dicino a spokeswoman 
for phoenixbased america west who was visiting new york she said 
america west believes it still could bid for the shuttle because 
the sale to trump hasnt yet been approved by the bankruptcy court 
trump said friday he expected the deal to be closed within 60 
days 
the creditors panel has the right to review any reorganization 
plan proposed by eastern and can propose its own plan to the 
bankruptcy judge 
in a separate development houstonbased texas air announced 
that it would not pay dividends for the first quarter on its four 
outstanding issues of preferred stock the dividends would have 
been payable on march 31 april 15 and april 30 depending on the 
issue the airline holding company said 
also tuesday lifland approved easterns sale of three boeing 
727100s to federal express corp for a total of about 108 
million eastern spokesman robin matell said in miami 
the sale fulfills an accord signed last september in which 
eastern agreed to sell 10 of the planes to federal express matell 
said the first seven were delivered between september and february 
in washington congressional democrats pulled off the senate 
floor legislation that would require president bush to appoint an 
emergency board to recommend a solution to the walkout 
the democratic lawmakers attributed their reversal to a desire 
to give potential buyers a chance to acquire eastern and to allow 
the bankruptcy court to find a way to end the walkout 
bush and congressional republicans have opposed the measure 
saying the carriers management and unions should work out their 
dispute privately bush had threatened to veto the bill which was 
slated for senate floor debate tuesday

lockheed corp said tuesday a 
reorganization that includes the creation of an employee stock plan 
was unrelated to investor harold simmons purchase of 53 percent 
of the aerospace companys stock 
the restructuring plan also includes the sale of lockheeds 
computer operations and acceleration of a previously announced 
program to move aircraft manufacturing operations from burbank and 
sell about 225 acres of land there that land includes the skunk 
works where the f117 stealth fighter is made 
the plan was approved at a board of directors meeting that was 
scheduled before simmons revealed monday he had accumulated 53 
percent of lockheeds 595 million shares said company spokesman 
robert slayman 
lockheed makes the trident ii missile the c5b military 
transport plane and works on nasas space station project and the 
star wars missile defense in addition to other military and 
aerospace projects 
there is no denying there are defensive characteristics to 
these things but that is not the primary purpose slayman said 
of the employeestock plan or esop and the other moves the 
primary purpose is to enhance our competitiveness this gives 
employees a bigger stake in the success of our company 
simmons who also said he planned substantial investments in 
chrysler corp paccar inc and phelps dodge corp said in a 
letter to lockheed management last friday that he didnt intend to 
try to buy the company 
we have no plans or desire to disrupt management we expect 
to be a constructive longterm shareholder the dallas investor 
said in the letter which he released to the press monday 
the esop would buy 105 million newly issued shares of lockheed 
stock for 500 million and the company would offset the dilution 
of its stock by buying an equal number of shares held by the 
public establishment of the esop would result in employee 
ownership of 17 percent of lockheed common stock the company said 
such plans are sometimes used to defend against hostile 
takeovers because it places stock in friendly hands for instance 
an esop was instrumental in polaroid corps successful defense 
against a buyout by california investor roy e disney 
lockheed adopted a poison pill takeover defense in december 
after simmons disclosed he intended to buy up to 15 million worth 
of the companys stock that plan would entitle current 
stockholders to buy additional newly issued stock at a discount in 
the event of a hostile takeover attempt thus making a buyout more 
expensive 
on monday simmons told the wall street journal he intended to 
invest at least 15 million each in shares of chrysler phelps 
dodge and paccar a bellevue wash truck maker 
lockheeds restructuring plan includes 
the speedup of the previously announced move of lockheed 
aeronautical systems co from factories next to burbank airport to 
palmdale and rye canyon calif and marietta ga the moves part 
of a consolidation effort are to be finished in 1991 instead of 
1992 or 1993 as executives previously stated 
the move will free 225 acres in burbank for sale the company 
said revealing for the first time the acreage 
the four companies or divisions that make up lockheeds 
information systems group will be sold the group with 3900 
employees accounted for 589 million of the companys 106 
billion in 1988 sales to be sold are calcomp of anaheim cadam 
inc of burbank metier inc of houston and dataplan of los gatos
