democratic govs richard celeste of ohio and 
mario cuomo of new york proposed monday that midwestern states 
voluntarily cut power plant emissions blamed for acid rain in return 
for federal aid to institute the reductions 
the proposal is aimed at breaking a deadlock in congress over 
cutting emissions that are believed responsible for acid rain in the 
eastern united states and canada without economically crippling the 
midwest the two governors said in a joint statement 
celeste said the proposal strikes the balance between the need 
to protect jobs and clean up the environment without hanging like a 
damocles sword over the coal industry 
cuomo called the agreement a terrific idea which he hopes can 
be sold to other governors and to congress 
the proposal will be introduced in congress shortly as an 
amendment to the federal clean air act by us sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny said gary fryer cuomos chief spokesman 
according to the two governors the proposal calls for a 10 
millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from coalfired 
utility plants nationwide in three stages by the year 2003 and a 3 
millionton reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions by 1998 
officials say about 23 million tons of sulfur dioxide and about 
10 million tons of nitrogen dioxide are expelled into the atmosphere 
nationally each year with the biggest bulk emitted from several 
midwestern states 
the two governors estimated it would cost about 18 billion a 
year to reduce emissions under the plan they proposed that 
polluters would pay half that cost the oil industry would pay 650 
million a year and the federal government would pay the remaining 
250 million annually 
the proposal also calls for a 10year 25 billion expansion of 
federal clean coal programs to develop new technologies for 
reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that money 
would be handed out on a 50 percent matchinggrant basis the two 
governors said 
the plan calls for the federal environmental protection agency to 
administer the emissions reduction program 
other proposed clean air act amendments now being considered by 
congress would require midwestern states to meet stricter emissions 
limits in a shorter time period 
people like dick celeste who are very pragmatic and very smart 
they see coming down the road a heavier hit on them than our bill 
would propose cuomo said plus they see a chance to have the 
federal government pick up 50 percent of their costs of going to the 
new technology so it the proposal serves a lot of different 
interests at the same time 
at a news conference in columbus ohio celeste said the acid 
rain issue has been delayed too long by those who prefer what is 
going on in ohio now nothing were tiptoeing past the graveyard 
he said adding the states economy will suffer if a compromise is 
not found 
celeste admitted the plan would face stiff opposition from 
utilities and coal producers and said he is willing to compromise as 
long as some amount of federal funding is retained 
american electric power co said it would have to cancel plans to 
build the worlds largest cleancoal plant near new haven wva 
if the proposal is passed the columbusbased company also said 
average electricity rates for customers of its eight subsidiary 
utilities in seven states would increase as much as 15 percent 
new york is one of eight northeastern states suing the epa in the 
us circuit court of appeals in washington dc to demand that 
the agency order seven midwestern and southern states to reduce 
sulfur dioxide emissions from coalfired plants 
the agreement will not affect new yorks pursuit of the suit 
cuomo administration officials said 
new york has claimed that hundreds of lakes in its adirondack 
mountains have high acid levels that are dangerous to plant and 
animal life 
many environmentalists in the eastern united states and canada 
maintain that emissions coming mainly from the midwest are carried 
eastward by the wind and fall to the ground as acid rain or snow

jews have lived in the south for more than 200 years but their 
history as a subgroup has long been ignored their religious roots 
and desire to fit in alongside their often fundamentalist christian 
neighbors have produced a cultural blending that sets them apart 
from the american jewish establishment 
i am not certain what it means to be both a jew and a 
southerner eli evans wrote in his personal account of growing up 
in durham nc to have inherited the jewish longing for a 
homeland while being raised with the southerners sense of home 
the sunbelt is home for more jews now the jewish population in 
the south has grown to about 11 million in alabama arkansas 
florida georgia kentucky louisiana mississippi north carolina 
south carolina tennessee texas and virginia according to a 1987 
estimate made for the american jewish committee florida has about 
half of the souths jewish population mostly in the southern part 
of the state 
the committee counts about 59 million jews throughout the united 
states 
jews historically were scattered in rural communities across the 
region and their presence remains strongest in mediumsized cities 
and small towns through active congregations like bnai shalom in 
tiny blountville tenn 
i have to come in for a cultural injection now and then because 
i miss it said sharon moskowitz 36 a new york native who with 
her husband and two children travels from marion va to 
blountville most friday nights to attend services at bnai shalom 
they are the only jews in marion a town of about 7000 in 
southwestern virginia near the northeastern tennessee border 
i used to be super super anxious about it ms moskowitz 
said of rearing her 6yearold son and 3yearold daughter in a 
nonjewish town my son goes to camp in long island and he was the 
only one who knew the hebrew songs at the camp in the north they 
live it so they dont have to learn it we cant take it for 
granted 
judy peiser who still lives in her hometown of memphis tenn 
and heads the center for southern folklore there said im always 
explaining the jewish culture its a constant learning process for 
them nonjewish southerners and a teaching process for jews 
youve got to know the answers 
jews first ventured to the south from the northeast or took more 
direct routes to flee unfriendly european and spanish homelands via 
ocean ports in galveston texas charleston sc and other 
southern cities 
the first arrivals were refugees of the fading spanish 
inquisition who dived early into the american melting pot and 
enthusiastically adopted the aristocratic southern culture 
the spanishspeaking jews were followed in the early to 
mid1800s by jews from germany who set out on foot as peddlers 
saved enough money to buy horses then wagons and later opened 
shops they were followed by a huge wave of east european immigrants 
who were more outwardly religious and who disdained the 
assimilationist tendencies of the earlier arrivals 
jews often took prominent places in their new southern hometowns 
and the region today lacks a distinct bluecollar jewish class 
jews had to walk a very tight line said abraham peck 
administrative director of the american jewish archives at hebrew 
union college in cincinnati its really an amazing thing that 
they were able to live in two worlds one a world of their own 
religious liberalism and the other a closedoff segregated 
society 
american judaisms most liberal faction reform judaism was born 
in the south where jews were more economically dependent on their 
nonjewish neighbors black and white 
carolyn lipsonwalker whose doctoral dissertation is titled 
shalom yall the folklore and culture of southern jews said 
southern jews have fused their social and religious practices to 
produce a dual culture 
among the examples her research turned up 
a cookbook put together by the women of a synagogue in baton 
rouge la includes a recipe for matzoh ball gumbo 
a synagogue in brookhaven miss for years held a high holy 
day shrimp fry even though traditional jewish dietary laws ban 
shellfish 
a jewish family in texas often barbecued matzoh on their 
backyard grill 
a nashville tenn octogenarian recalled a temple celebration 
marked by the arrival of hanukkah claus on reindeer 
a jewish man from savannah ga explained he never thought of 
marrying outside of his faith asked what he meant ms 
lipsonwalker said he replied well southern jews of course 
ethnic differences were discouraged in the south she remembers 
being chided as a child in tuscaloosa ala for using yiddish words 
but the practice of religion was encouraged ms lipsonwalker 
said 
jews in the south both natives and transplants are affiliated 
with synagogues and other jewish organizations more than jews living 
elsewhere and jews in the south often travel hundreds of miles to 
seek jewish contact for themselves and their children her research 
concluded 
until recently even the conservative and orthodox jews in the 
south were less traditional than their northern jewish 
counterparts ms lipsonwalker wrote what will the goyim 
nonjews think takes on a great significance in the relatively 
homogeneous south 
the south has its notorious examples of violent antisemitism 
including the ku klux klan and the atlanta lynching of leo frank for 
the murder of a 14yearold pencil factory worker in 1913 but gail 
gans a researcher in new york for the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith said the region no longer stands out as a bastion of 
discrimination and hatred against jews 
it has historically of course she said 
evans peck and other researchers agreed the postcivil war 
period was among the worst for antisemitism in the south 
a notable example was the scapegoating of judah p benjamin a 
new orleans lawyer who served as attorney general secretary of war 
and secretary of state under jefferson davis many blamed him for 
the confederacys defeat while others falsely accused him of 
involvement in abraham lincolns assassination evans said benjamin 
fled in disguise to england 
during the 1870s and through the beginning of the 20th century 
antisemitism in the south in all its manifestations were the 
actions of powerless men reaching out to compensate for their 
economic distress peck wrote in a paper on southern jewry 
blacks served as a lightning rod absorbing expressions of bias 
that might otherwise have been directed at jews in the south where 
antisemitism was aimed more against a generalized stereotype of 
the jew said joseph cohen a tennessean who founded the jewish 
studies program at tulane university 
the blacks and the catholics had the worst time of it and they 
were always a buffer he said 
as for southern jews their years of being neighbors and local 
merchants seemed to help defuse potential trouble said cohen 
there was a big difference between the stereotypical jew and sam 
who ran the store

financial shortfalls may force 
argentina latin americas leading user of nuclear power to halt 
construction on a third nuclear reactor and a heavywater plant its 
top nuclear official says 
plans are being made to stop work on the nuclear reactor atucha 
ii which is 60 percent completed and arroyito 90 percent 
finished unless financing is obtained or the government agrees to a 
800 million budget request said emma perez ferreira president of 
the national atomic energy commission 
well have to stop work on the big ones first if we dont get 
enough money or obtain financing for the projects ms perez 
ferreira argentinas topranking female government official said 
in a recent interview 
a shutdown could hurt argentinas nuclear industry which is the 
most advanced in the western hemisphere outside the united states 
and canada and cut into its future sales of surplus heavy water 
argentina has a contract to build a 100million 10megawatt 
nuclear reactor outside lima peru it also has contracts to build a 
nuclear reactor in algeria and to provide enriched uranium for a 
small experimental nuclear reactor at irans tehran university ms 
perez ferreira said 
argentinas nuclear technicians have mastered the entire fuel 
cycle which gives them the ability to make nuclear weapons but 
officials from president raul alfonsin on down deny this is in their 
plans 
at one time the nuclear program was closely tied to the armed 
forces in particular the navy an admiral headed the atomic energy 
commission until the early 1980s and some reports at the time said 
the military favored building an atomic bomb 
argentina mines its own uranium ore in the andes it prepares its 
own fuel and is capable of enriching the fuel making fuel 
elements running nuclear reactors and reprocessing the fuel 
enriching and reprocessing fuel are the keys to making nuclear 
weapons 
argentina the worlds eighthlargest country geographically has 
two existing nuclear power plants until its economic crisis 
worsened last year it had dreams of building four power plants by 
the end of the century 
theres no sense in talking now even about a fourth nuclear 
plant ms perez ferreira said argentina also has an 
uraniumenrichment plant six research reactors and two reprocessing 
plants 
the nuclear program is important to argentina providing up to 20 
percent of its electrical power and is a source of pride to a 
country whose standard of living has declined steadily since the 
1950s 
but now argentina is the developing worlds thirdlargest debtor 
behind brazil and mexico owing 55 billion it also has a 247 
percent inflation rate in addition to other severe economic 
problems including a loss of real wages for workers 
indeed 22 percent of atomic energy commissions 6500member 
work force have left their jobs since 1983 many for similar posts 
offering double their pay in switzerland brazil and the united 
states ms perez ferreira said 
neighboring brazil has a nuclearpower program but its sole plant 
near rio de janeiro has had constant troubles plans to build two 
other nuclear plants have been set aside for the time being 
ms perez ferreira a 52yearold nuclear physicist took over 
the commission last year when her predecessor quit over budgetary 
disputes with the government as head of commission she reports 
directly to president alfonsin 
although officials deny any plans for nuclear weapons argentina 
has yet to sign the international nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
it opposes the treaty on grounds that it interferes with national 
sovereignty the other nonsignatory nations with nuclear technology 
are south africa israel india pakistan and brazil 
accidents at argentine nuclear facilities have left three 
technicians dead since 1982 but experts say argentina is not 
considered unsafe a radioactive water spill and a burst pipe also 
briefly shut down atucha i and the embalse plant last year and in 
may 
national reliance on nucleargenerated power became apparent in 
april when power shortages caused in part by temporary shutdowns of 
atucha i and embalse forced emergency power cutoffs in buenos aires 
mar del plata and other major cities 
argentinas nuclear interest stems from 1950 during the first 
presidency of juan d peron its first power plant was atucha i a 
335megawatt facility built with west german technology in 1974 
the second embalse outside cordoba in northcentral argentina 
was finished in 1983 built with canadian technology it has 600 
megawatts of power equal to the connecticut yankee plant in the 
united states 
atucha ii if it is completed will have 745 megawatts

a reputation for ruthlessness stuck to robert f kennedy because 
it seemed to explain something about him 
he was the kid who lived to tackle in football games the 
diligent young aide to sen joseph mccarthy the hound on jimmy 
hoffas trial the designated sob in john f kennedys campaigns 
the carpetbagger senator from new york the candidate for 
president who waited until eugene mccarthy had led the way 
reputation for ruthlessness is even in the index of an 
admiring biography by arthur m schlesinger jr 
but bobby kennedy was also according to luella hennessey a 
nurse who worked for the family the most thoughtful and 
considerate of the kennedy children 
in a roman catholic family that lived for politics he was the 
one boy who might have become a priest 
hes got high moral standards brother john once said 
bobby was the passionate one the brother of the greatest 
intensity a brooding quality some found to be deeply irish 
my he is unassimilated isnt he the poet robert lowell 
remarked after meeting him 
bobby first channeled that passion into college football then 
into service as an indefatigable aide to congressional committees 
and his brothers campaigns finally bereft of the brother he 
idolized he became a passionate advocate of civil rights and after 
years of backing the war an opponent of the bloodshed in vietnam 
bobby resembles me more than any of the other children 
patriarch joseph p kennedy once said he had the same capacity 
for likes and dislikes for love and hate 
robert francis was the seventh of nine kennedy children 10 years 
younger than joe jr and eight years younger than jack when you 
come from that far down he once said you have to struggle to 
survive 
he was the smallest of the four boys accidentprone and clumsy 
but determined to keep up 
unhappy at his slow progress in learning to swim young bobby 
tried to learn all at once by jumping off a yawl into nantucket 
sound where he thrashed until joe pulled him out 
it showed either a lot of guts or no sense at all depending on 
how you looked at it said jack 
herbert stokinger his football coach at milton academy 
recalled bob at only 160 pounds loved to crunch he loved 
to hit his man and when he hit he seemed to come alive 
bobby was an allout said supreme court justice william o 
douglas who took the young attorney along on a visit to the soviet 
union in 1955 if he was climbing a peak or hiking a trail there 
was nothing else in the world to do but that 
schlesinger author of robert kennedy and his times traces 
the reputation for ruthlessness to jack kennedys campaign for the 
senate in 1952 bobby the campaign manager once booted a local 
labor leader out of the office saying if youre not going to 
work dont hang around here 
when jack kennedy decided he didnt want to wage a joint campaign 
with massachusetts gov paul dever he sent his brother to deliver 
the bad news dont give it the joint campaign to them jack 
told him but dont get me involved in it 
jack kennedy dever reflected after the campaign which he 
lost is the first irish brahmin bobby is the last irish 
puritan 
bobby played a similar role in the presidential campaign of 1960 
inside the campaign he was the tireless investigator and goad 
schlesinger wrote responsible for everything but the speeches 
outside he became the man to do the harsh jobs saying no telling 
people off whipping the reluctant and recalcitrant into line 
well before the 1960 campaign bobby had earned a national 
reputation as a relentless investigator 
in 1952 his father arranged for him to work for sen joseph 
mccarthy the crusading anticommunist who headed the permanent 
subcommittee on investigations of the senate government operations 
committee 
mccarthy had made the acquaintance of the kennedy family after 
coming to washington in 1947 and had won the admiration and support 
of fellow irishman joseph kennedy 
mccarthy made bobby an assistant counsel one of 15 to his 
young chief counsel roy cohn kennedys major work was a report 
detailing that threefourths of the cargos reaching china were on 
westernflag ships this at the time china was sponsoring the 
communist side in the korean war 
the committees more famous work the hunt for subversives within 
the government was energetically led by cohn and g david schine 
cohn and schine claimed they knew from the outset what was 
wrong and they were not going to allow the facts to interfere 
said kennedy who resigned from the committee after six months 
at this time in his life bobby made a disagreeable impression 
even on some friends of the family theodore sorenson jacks 
speechwriter found the younger brother to be militant 
aggressive intolerant opinionated somewhat hollow in his 
convictions 
bobby returned to the government operations committee in 1954 as 
counsel for the minority democrats resuming his fencing matches 
with cohn on june 11 in the acidic armymccarthy hearings kennedy 
and cohn nearly came to blows in the hearing room in what one 
newspaper headline called a hate clash 
even after mccarthy was censured in 1954 bobby felt a personal 
loyalty to the republican from wisconsin in 1955 he walked out on a 
speech by edward r murrow who had denounced mccarthy in a famous 
cbs broadcast 
kennedy became majority counsel of the investigations committee 
under sen john l mcclellan after democrats regained control of 
the senate in 1954 first he went after teamsters president dave 
beck and then jimmy hoffa who led the union after beck was 
convicted of tax evasion 
kennedys pursuit of hoffa was bitter and personal on both 
sides and continued when kennedy became attorney general in his 
brothers administration hoffa called kennedy a young 
dimwitted curlyheaded smartaleck

in the kennedy administration bobby was not only the attorney 
general but was also acknowledged as the presidents closest 
adviser that closeness was in some ways a union of opposites 
john kennedy was the more secure the freer of the two freer 
of his father of his family of his faith of the entire 
irishamerican predicament schlesinger wrote the two 
brothers had moved in different directions in adolescence and young 
manhood john establishing his intellectuality robert his 
toughness john his independence robert his commitment to the 
family 
devastated by his brothers death bobby struck his associates as 
withdrawn almost shrunken he adopted his brothers habit of 
smoking cigars and began carrying around one of jfks old coats he 
read greek tragedies and the work of albert camus and turned to an 
old passion football 
everybody was trying to get the hate and the anger out of their 
systems pierre salinger jfks old press secretary told lester 
and irene david authors of bobby kennedy the making of a folk 
hero 
bobby was absolutely relentless salinger said he attacked 
the man with the ball like a tiger slamming bruising and crushing 
and so did everyone else one guy broke a leg and you couldnt 
count the bloodied noses and contusions 
bobbys own political campaigns were preceded by long bouts of 
indecision he didnt announce his candidacy for the senate in new 
york until the latter half of august 1964 although he wound up 
winning easily 
because he was a kennedy there was always talk some hopeful 
some despairing that he would someday run for president 
he remained an enigma something the cartoonist jules feiffer 
ridiculed in 1967 as the bobby twins 
the good bobby is a fervent civil libertarian the bad bobby is 
a fervent wiretapper the cartoon said adding if you want one 
bobby to be your president you will have to take both for 
bobbies are widely noted for their family unity 
bobby wavered again in 1968 before jumping into the presidential 
race days after sen eugene mccarthy had run a close second to 
president lyndon johnson in the new hampshire primary 
it is hard to forgive kennedy his shy calculating delay in 
declaring himself or forgive the shaggy rudeness of his final 
entrance lowell said in oregon even though he affirmed his 
admiration for the man 
jacqueline kennedy worried in the spring of 1968 do you know 
what i think will happen to bobby the same thing that happened to 
jack there is so much hatred in this country and more people 
hate bobby than hated jack 
on the night he won the california primary bobby spoke for a 
moment with kenneth odonnell a longtime kennedy friend 
you know kenny he said i feel now for the first time 
that ive shaken off the shadow of my brother 
within hours he was dead

the search by american crab fishermen for new 
more productive seas combined with the soviet unions interest in 
us fishing technology has netted both sides a new fishing 
agreement 
last week president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
signed an agreement allowing for joint fishing management and 
conservation in the north pacific 
members of the alaska crab coalition and other american fisheries 
groups had negotiated with the soviet union for more than a year in 
an effort to get an agreement that would allow us fishermen access 
to the western bering sea 
ronald k peterson seattlebased owner of a crab boat and 
president of the alaska coalition hopes us crabbers will be able 
to forge joint venture agreements with soviet enterprises and fish 
in soviet water this year three soviet ports would be opened to 
american fishermen he said 
while us bottomfish fishermen also hope eventually to cast nets 
in soviet waters for pollock cod and other species the agreement 
with the soviets is seen as especially beneficial for the crabbers 
after a big fleet buildup to pursue huge stocks of crab in the 
american sector of the bering sea in the 1970s crab populations 
dwindled around 1980 for a variety of reasons including disease and 
predators 
in 1980 we took 130 million pounds of red king crab in the 
bering sea with 236 boats participating peterson said last 
year we had the same number of boats and they took a little over 
12 million pounds 
crab boats cost 25 million new and owners need to pull up 
4000 to 5000 worth of crabs daily just to break even said arni 
thomson executive director of the coalition which represents 80 
bering sea crab boats 
peterson said that initially 30 american crab boats would 
probably be allowed in soviet waters thomson said the soviets 
probably would process the catch 
the soviets said thomson will benefit by having greater access 
to underutilized fish species in us fishing areas and by the use 
of superior american fishing technology 
as an example he said american crabbers the past five years 
have developed new methods of harvesting deepdwelling snow crab 
pots are strung together perhaps 20 at a time he said and then 
pulled up at once on a common marking buoy a departure from the 
usual method of each pot being placed separately 
the soviets do not have that expertise and that is a very 
important fishery now to us thomson said 
thomson said he expected that the benefits for american crews of 
fishing off siberia will be over the long term and will provide 
stability to the bering sea crab fishery 
the bering sea reportedly is the richest bottomfish ground in the 
world two million metric tons are taken annually on the us side 
of the sea and the soviet side apparently has an equalsize 
resource said ted evans executive director of the alaska factory 
trawler association in seattle 
the loser in the new cooperative agreements could be japans 
fishermen who for decades had both soviet and us waters in the 
north pacific almost to themselves 
the belief by americans and soviets alike is that japan has 
been a good trading partner but the soviets and americans want 
another trading partner in each other for the competition 
peterson said

the magnitude of a trilliondollar 
deficit is a little more comprehensible to david witte and his 
sixthgrade classmates after they tried but failed to collect 1 
million bottle caps and pulltabs 
frank heatwoles students finished the yearlong project with 
624720 of the caps and tabs from drink containers 
a million is a lot more than a person thinks david said 
adding that the us government is not a million dollars or a 
billion but a trillion dollars in debt 
classmate jay lippincott agreed 
when i think about a trillion i dont want to think of it we 
tried and we only got half a million he said i thought we 
could do it 
the project produced overflowing boxes and barrels of caps and 
tabs in the corner of the lincoln elementary school classroom 
students got friends and relatives to help by donating the caps 
or tabs 
julie higgenbothom said organization was the key to collecting so 
many items 
ive gotten lots of friends to help and when you get 
organized its a snap she said 
angela swartout got both her parents involved her mother brought 
in a box containing 6000 tabs and her father contributed a 40pound 
bag of them 
restaurants and taverns also helped 
when collecting ended last week the 400 pounds of caps and 602 
pounds of tabs were taken to a recycling company which paid the 
class 315 for them 
part of the proceeds went for a class lunch of pizza students 
were considering what they wanted to buy with the rest

this years drought in the west is grim news 
for north american ducks battered throughout the 1980s by bad 
weather in breeding areas warns the fish and wildlife service 
drought is hurting prime duck breeding areas in the dakotas 
alaska montana and the canadian provinces of alberta manitoba 
saskatchewan and british columbia not only by drying up marshy 
areas where ducks breed but by enticing cattle to graze in areas 
they normally wouldnt reach and by leading farms to put such areas 
under the plow 
the situation looks grim said frank dunkle director of the 
service 
if preliminary results of the annual survey of nesting areas 
done in cooperation with canadian authorities are borne out later 
this summer the service will have to take a hard look at 
hunting regulations for the fall he said 
the survey of duck broods in july forms the basis for each years 
hunting regulations in 1985 the survey cut seasons and bag limits 
sharply 
duck populations in the survey areas used to range well above 40 
million but they fell in the 1980s to an alltime low of 30 million 
in 1985 before rebounding slightly to 34 million to 35 million 
bob blohm assistant chief of the survey branch said in a 
telephone interview from the servicess patuxent md research 
station that results were still coming in from this years survey 
particularly from northerly areas he said he could not predict what 
the final count will be but the prospect for a large number of 
offspring this year is dim 
many ducks returning from the south this spring discovering 
their normal breeding areas drier than normal may have found 
nesting areas farther north there is a question though of how 
productive they are when they do that blohm said 
many areas experienced a mild dry fall and winter followed by 
low precipitation and strong winds this spring according to a 
statement by the service in southern canada poor conditions 
began as early as last summer when less than onethird of the 
prairie region received normal precipitation it is believed 
rainfall this late in the spring probably will not help much because 
the ground is so dry it will just soak up the water 
one study in a fivesquaremile area around woodworth nd 
indicated that only 38 percent of the basins had water and those 
levels were low the service said old wives lake in southcentral 
saskatchewan is dry for the first time since 1937 whitewater 
lake in southwest manitoba traditionally an important areas for 
ducks is only a quarter full 
the service said biologists were reporting congregations of 
ducks crowding into what water remains often with little nesting 
cover

the governors of ohio and new york have 
agreed on an approach to fighting acid rain that balances the 
interests of coalproducing states and environmental preservation 
officials said sunday night 
sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal from such 
states as ohio long have been blamed as a major cause of acid rain 
which environmentalists say is destroying waters and woodlands in 
the northeast 
gov richard celestes press secretary debra phillips said the 
agreement which she termed an outline at this point is a proposal 
to congress and would be unveiled monday she said the next step is 
for celeste and new york gov mario cuomo to meet with congressional 
leaders 
the new york times quoted cuomo in its monday editions as calling 
the agreement a reasonable and imaginative effort to resolve our 
differences and solve the problem of acid rain he said he would 
push hard and will keep pushing to achieve a national program to 
deal with the issue 
celeste considers the agreement a balance between preserving 
jobs and cleaning up the environment ms phillips said 
state sen bob ney a republican said the agreement is a hard 
slap across the face of ohios coal miners 
ney said celeste has promised some form of sulfur dioxide 
emission reductions to fellow democrat cuomo possibly in exchange 
for new yorks dropping of a federal lawsuit that attempts to force 
emission reductions in coalburning states 
ive been told that ohio was agreeing to some reduction over a 
period of years ney said for celeste to do this he would 
either have to do it by executive order or ask the ohio legislature 
to do it he would have run into a brick wall there 
ohio environmental protection agency director richard shank would 
not discuss details sunday night but he said the agreement enters 
on cleancoal technology and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions 
and also nitrogen oxide which also is a contributor to acid rain 
he said the lawsuit is not involved in the agreement 
shank said ohio and new york officials met over several months 
and came up with common ground on acid rain 
i wasnt too optimistic going into it but after months of work 
on it we finally came up with something shank said it looks 
at it acid rain as a national problem 
in albany ny cuomos chief spokesman gary fryer said the 
proposal stemmed from a discussion between the two governors last 
july at a meeting of the national democratic governors association 
on mackinac island mich 
fryer said new york and ohio officials have been negotiating for 
several months on the acid rain issue fryer said the agreement 
will involve emissions blamed for acid rain not just from ohio but 
from other states as well 
if approved by congress itll reduce emissions everywhere

while the worlds politicians weigh the fourth 
superpower summit some russian immigrants living on a milelong 
slice of brooklyn seashore already have declared it a success 
they judge it so not because of any great strides in human rights 
or arms control but because it is a symbol of hope a sign that 
change is possible 
inside brighton beachs white acia delicatessen where american 
cookies are sold alongside hot ponchicks and kbac russian versions 
of knishes and apple cider simon feldman is cautiously optimistic 
you cannot be very optimistic because of the communist 
system feldman says wiping his hands on an already stained apron 
but soviet leader mikhail gorbachev is really one of the 
stars weve been looking for we really want him to succeed 
feldman said 
feldman is one of an estimated 35000 russian jews who left their 
country and settled in this once aging and economically depressed 
ocean community 
the immigrants are credited with breathing new life into the 
neighborhood which is sandwiched between coney island and 
sheepshead bay their presence is so strong that the community is 
now called little odessa after the ukrainian city on the black 
sea 
the main thing which is our concern is for peace feldman 
said in halting english while critics say the summit failed to 
produce substantive arms control agreements feldman said any 
accomplishment means a lot 
like feldman restaurateurs misha fiddler and mark rakhman both 
natives of odessa had high praise for gorbachev 
rakhman who owns the russian nightclub national and a gourmet 
delicatessen called mampi international says the new spirit of 
openness in the soviet union shows theyre starting to make a 
little progress 
it will get better better and better says rakhman leaning 
against a case of siberian red mustard caviar and mushroom and 
vegetable salads 
the changes will not come overnight says rakhman but over time 
they the soviets must grow again from the ground up 
fiddler who owns a fish store and boardwalk restaurant called 
moscow agrees that gorbachev is doing great things for russia 
but as far as the summit is concerned fiddler said it was 
president reagan who got what he wanted hes a smart man today 
reagan is buying from the russians peace 
its going to be peaceful for a long time says fiddler an 
admitted cynic at least a year 
though many of brightons russian immigrants hailed the summit as 
a step forward in the relationship between the united states and the 
soviet union ilya milman was not one of them 
what can i tell you i dont believe in russia thats all i 
dont believe said milman putting aside the hoboe pycckoe caobo 
new russian word newspaper to offer his views 
milman once a professional team handball coach in kiev and now 
manager of a local nightclub says all he heard were words 
saying is nothing they must do something says milman a 
coach for the us olympic handball team in the 1984 games we 
have no results 
he conceded the soviet people have new freedoms but he says they 
remain politically tethered 
its good that you can talk a little more freely now said 
milman dressed in a denim jacket sporting the olympic logo but 
theyre still told stay still not too much 
as for gorbachev milman says on the outside hes a little 
bit changed but underneath its the same hes just wearing a new 
face 
milman would not call the summit a success and did not expect 
immediate results 
we must wait in russia any change is for the best he said 
but we must wait

barely more than half of us farm families 
income came from farm earnings in 1986 according to an agriculture 
department report 
jobs in town and other offfarm sources provided the rest in 
fact such earnings generated the bulk of the income for many farm 
families according to a coming article in usdas farmline magazine 
outside income has represented around half of what farm families 
earn since 1960 at times surging to as much as 55 percent 
economist mary ahearn of usdas economic research service says 
reliance on offfarm income is likely to be greatest on small farms 
on the smallest more than 96 percent of total household income in 
1986 came from outside sources 
about two thirds of us farms are small farms ones with less 
than 40000 in agricultural product sales they cover about 30 
percent of the nations farmland but take in less than 10 percent of 
crop and livestock sales 
less than 4 percent of their net cash income came from farming 
according to economic research service statistics the average in 
1986 was about 950 a farm according to the service 
midsize farms with less than 250000 in farm product sales 
represented 23 percent of the farms and almost half of the land 
their share of total us sales was 37 percent 
such farms depend more on farm product sales than do smaller 
ones seventyfive percent of earnings came from agriculture and 85 
percent of the operators said their chief occupation was farming 
offfarm income was the lowest of any group it averaged 13296 
midsize farms are often viewed as the closest thing in real life 
to the traditional image of the family farm but 30 percent of 
the families in the category had 1986 incomes below the poverty 
level 
only 4 percent of us farms fell into the largefarm category 
with gross sales topping 250000 but they took up 24 percent of 
the nations farm land and their receipts accounted for 51 percent 
of total marketings ninetyfive percent of their income came from 
farms according to the report 
offfarm income for the group averaged 17589 per household and 
net cash farm incomes were 320978 on average ers researchers 
themselves however say that is likely to be an overestimate 
even among large farmers however 20 percent of the households 
were estimated to have incomes below the poverty level ahearn said 
that figure should not be surprising since farming is a risky 
business with high variation in incomes owing to drought price 
drops and poor investments 
among the various kinds of farmers fruit and nut producers were 
no 1 in total offfarm income with an average of 43365 general 
and miscellaneous livestock producers were next with 26333 dairy 
producers had the lowest average offfarm income 6525 
average offfarm incomes were more than 20000 in much of the 
nation but below that figure in the corn belt appalachia the lake 
states and the northern plains many of the states where families 
were most dependent on offfarm income were in the south the report

soviet grain production could reach 215 million 
tons this year agriculture department economists say 
production at that level would surpass each of the previous two 
years and mark the first time ever that soviet production was above 
200 million tons for three straight years according to a recent 
agricultural outlook summary 
it said that the amount of area planted in grain has increased 
only a bit since last year when the total was not particularly 
high but that yield could reach record levels set in 1978 
coarse grain production is actually expected to drop from last 
years levels but wheat could be in for a 10 percent gain the 
forecast said it said imports most likely would be down from last 
years levels

american and soviet inspectors are set to begin 
the historic job of verifying compliance with the mediumrange 
missile treaty signed sealed and delivered by president reagan and 
mikhail s gorbachev 
were set were ready to go said ken pease a spokesman for 
the onsite inspection agency the new office set up by the pentagon 
to make sure the soviets comply with the requirements of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
the soviet union and the united states will have the same rights 
of inspection which will include onsite checks for the first time 
in the history of superpower arms control efforts 
the treaty provides that the inspections can begin 30 days after 
the pact takes effect that clock began ticking wednesday at the 
moscow summit when reagan and the soviet leader exchanged 
ratification documents for the pact they signed dec 8 
the major item on this summers agenda is a series of 
baseline inspections during a 60day period beginning july 1 
those inspections will establish the basic data for all facilities 
covered by the treaty 
the united states will have the right to inspect 133 sites 
including 126 in the soviet union six in east germany and one in 
czechoslovakia the soviets in turn will have the right to examine 
14 sites in the united states and another dozen us facilities in 
western europe 
the inspections will be conducted by 20 teams of up to 10 persons 
each according to the treaty pease said the american teams have 
been training for months were ready our teams are ready he 
said 
in late june the united states will begin moving teams of 
inspectors to frankfurt west germany in preparation for the 
inspections 
details of how the inspections are to be conducted are spelled 
out in great detail by the inf treaty pease noted for example the 
american teams can arrive through four portals including two in 
the soviet union one in east germany and one in czechoslovakia 
once the inspection team lands it has between four and 48 hours 
to tell the soviets which site it wants to check the soviets then 
have nine hours to move the team to the facility followed by a 
onehour briefing the inspectors have 24 hours to complete their 
job but the time can be extended to 32 hours by mutual agreement 
the soviets have exactly the same rights under the same terms 
pease noted 
the two sides have conducted three sets of technical talks to 
work out the details for example among the items already 
negotiated are the size color and words that will be printed on the 
identification tags worn by the inspection teams the types of 
identification that will be attached to the inspectors luggage and 
whether the inspectors will bring binoculars or have them supplied 
in addition to preparing for the inspections the american agency 
will also escort the soviet inspectors as they tour american sites 
the americans will be commanded by army brig gen roland lajoie 
who speaks russian and whose career has been chiefly in intelligence 
efforts 
he is a former us military attache at the american embassy in 
moscow and is a former commander of a special us liaison unit in 
east germany that unit was spotlighted in march 1985 when one of 
its members army maj arthur d nicholson was shot and killed by a 
soviet sentry 
lajoies background highlights one of the side issues which will 
be part of the inspections the battle over intelligence gathering 
inspectors on both sides will be watching to pick up whatever 
stray information they can which could be of military value for 
example soviet inspectors will be stationed outside the magna 
utah plant of hercules inc the plant was one of the production 
sites of the pershing ii missile now banned by the treaty but 
other missiles are also produced there including stages of the mx 
midgetman and trident 
any incidental information that can be learned is fair game 
for both sides said one official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
in addition to the baseline inspections in july both sides can 
begin destroying missiles under terms of the pact which provides for 
the elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 
300 to 3400 miles 
the soviets have identified eight sites where they plan to 
eliminate some of the 5200 items they will have to destroy 
including missile stages launchers and related equipment up to 
five of those sites may be in continuous use according to the 
soviets and they will be watched by us inspection teams 
the united states hasnt yet identified the sites where it will 
destroy its pershing ii and groundlaunched missiles but it must 
give the soviets a list by the end of june 
each side will have onsite inspection rights for 13 years 
including shortnotice inspections

for many of the americans getting their first peek 
at the kremlin during last weeks summit one surprise was simply 
aesthetic 
the kremlin as in president reagan rattled the kremlin with 
his demand that conjures up the image of a big nononsense 
governmentissue office building with which we would all be familiar 
except that it is hidden behind suffocating security 
like the pentagon for example or the general motors building 
moscow has more than its share of these sorts of structures but 
the kremlin isnt one of them 
the kremlin is a complex of antique buildings framed by an 
imposing redbrick wall it includes breathtaking centuriesold 
cathedrals many of them highlighted by giltpainted onion domes 
several ornate palaces italianrenaissance yellow not government 
gray have passed from the czars to become offices of the 
commissars the grounds are lavish and at least in late may they 
are green and beautiful the red flags always wave and the red star 
shines bright above several spectacular gates 
much of the kremlin is off limits but some of it is not 
tourists stroll through russians use it as a shortcut to work 
brides still wearing their dresses and veils stop by and leave 
their weddingday flowers at memorials to russias war dead 
this is ground zero asked one american journalist a fellow 
who found it incongruous to consider that if the bombing ever 
starts the white house and the kremlin will be the first to go 
weddingday flowers or not

then there is the kgb 
us officials provided every sort of briefing prior to the 
summit journalists were steeped in subjects ranging from arms 
control to soviet agricultural trends since collectivization moscow 
cognoscenti added their expertise on politburo intrigues not to 
mention the best new cooperative restaurants and a buyers guide to 
the beriozka gift shops 
but no one wanted to talk about the kgb 
is my hotel room bugged are we being followed is the taxi 
driver a spy what about the friendly teenager we saw near the 
arbat shopping mall and then again near red square he wants to 
trade his rubles for dollars at a very good rate is this a setup 
the summiteers have all left well fed and unscathed and so now 
the truth can be told the kgb was on its best boyscout behavior 
border guards seemed benign and friendly passport clerks wielded 
rubber stamps there was little sign of bugging following or 
planting of false evidence 
nonetheless the kgb made its presence felt 
physically it seemed to be everywhere if there were eight doors 
to a summit hotel seven would be locked and four security men would 
be checking ids at no 8 you had the impression that maxwell smart 
i was checking the ids while maxwell smart ii was checking on 
maxwell smart i and so on 
on several occasions reporters seeking your basic 
manonthestreet interviews were told by moscow residents in so 
many words are you crazy asking me about reagan those two guys 
over there they are kgb how do i know youre not kgb too 
others were only too eager to talk glasnost seemed to be 
trickling down slowly but surely

think hed want to get home to his own bed but once in merry old

have hoped the stopover would draw attention to the bolshevik way of

london is everything moscow is not singlefamily homes colorful 
office buildings benign bobbies shopping to beat the band more

i am delighted to be in a country one traveler said upon 
arriving in england which accepts its own currency 
the soviets make it pretty near impossible for a foreigner to do 
serious business in rubles the soviets want dollars or pounds or 
the finnish markaa any denomination that has value in world 
markets 
the ruble is not traded outside soviet borders for fear it will 
lose its value and the soviets need international exchange to pay 
for import goods hotels and restaurants and souvenir shops that 
cater to visitors invariably will accept no business from soviet 
citizens and no rubles from anyone

the united states and other big countries 
should coordinate economic policy because no single government can 
any longer underwrite world prosperity the head of the 
international monetary fund urged today 
managing director michel camdessus was apparently referring to 
attempts to mesh major economic policy among the group of seven 
known as g7 that includes the united states britain west 
germany japan italy canada and his native france the soviet 
union is not among the funds 151 member governments 
the relative strength of the european community and japan has 
grown making the us economy a less dominant force than it once 
was camdessus said 
indeed no single government can any longer underwrite 
prosperity or stability for the world as a whole 
economists say for example that it would be disastrous if all 
members of g7 made an allout effort to increase their exports to 
one another at the same time 
efforts to tighten coordination have been discouraged by events 
following last years agreement in paris that the price of the 
dollar had fallen enough after that came octobers stock market 
crash and the continued fall of the dollar 
camdessus said it may never be possible to get total agreement 
among governments at any given time but it should be possible to 
make their policies more compatible 
unless a satisfactory answer can be given to the question 
whats in it for us cooperation will be at best insubstantial 
he said 
he listed cases where national policies urged for the benefit of 
the world as a whole could in his view also help the countries that 
adopt them camdessus said that 
more reduction of the us budget deficit would enable the 
united states to sell more of its goods abroad without crowding out 
us private spending or spurring inflation he said it also would 
pave the way for lasting reductions in interest rates and make it 
easier for future us governments to be more flexible about taxes 
and government spending 
western europe and japan should be vigorous about structural 
reforms which would speed up both their growth and the growth of 
the rest of the world he did not give details but western europe 
and japan have been repeatedly urged to turn attention away from 
exports and produce more for home markets 
if some newly industrialized countries gradually reduced their 
big surpluses in world trade they and the world would both be 
helped again camdessus did not explain but taiwan and south korea 
have been frequently advised to do some of the same restructuring 
recommended to japan and western europe 
heavily indebted countries should be more resolute about making 
sound policies and needed reforms backed for debt reductions and 
new loans from creditor countries 
camdessus speech was prepared for an international monetary 
conference in chicago and copies were distributed by his washington 
headquarters to reporters here

in seeking the presidency george bush may 
take a page from the new book by new jersey gov thomas kean 
keans modern moderate republicanism as outlined in his 
autobiographical book the politics of inclusion has caught 
bushs eye 
that along with the popular governors growing national profile 
has put kean on the socalled short list of potential bush running 
mates 
the 51yearold kean approaching the end of his second and last 
gubernatorial term is in many ways an automatic contender for the 
national ticket 
bush campaigning last month in new jersey said would he have 
the qualifications for national office the answer is clearly yes 
as the uncontested head of the republican party in his state 
kean is in a position to deliver a hefty 16 electoral college votes 
in november enough to get any presidential candidates attention 
in 1985 kean was reelected by the largest margin in state 
history with unprecedented support among blacks and other 
minorities 
he has headed the republican governors association and gained 
national recognition for his programs president reagan in the 
state of the union message this year singled out keans education 
reforms 
despite these credentials many political observers believe the 
governor is at best a long shot to round out the bush ticket 
among those voicing the most doubt is kean himself he says hes 
not campaigning for the job and doesnt expect to be asked 
i dont think thats going to happen im not doing anything to 
make it happen he insisted in washington last month 
obvious problems with a kean candidacy are his similarities to 
bush the two have similar patrician backgrounds 
bush went to yale while kean attended princeton bush is the 
scion of a wealthy connecticut family keans family amassed a 
fortune in real estate and utilities 
bush is the son of a us senator keans family tree includes 
his congressman father the late robert kean a grandfather and 
greatuncle served in the senate further back keans ancestors 
include new jerseys first constitutional governor and john kean a 
contemporary of george washington 
the idea of kean on the national ticket is unpopular with many 
gop conservatives kean is moderate even liberal on some issues 
held sacred by the right he has frequently and openly broken with 
president reagan 
kean was first elected governor in 1981 beating rep james 
florio dnj by a margin of less than 1800 votes the contest 
was so close that the winner remained uncertain for weeks 
after a stormy first year marked by a sagging economy and 
uncertainty on the new governors staff kean gradually built 
support that has since earned him high approval ratings 
the governor has an aggressive publicrelations operation topped 
by his prominent presence in tourism commercials for the state of 
new jersey which are broadcast nationally 
kean makes no secret about wanting to play a role at the gop 
convention and in the fall campaign he has already been called to 
bushs office for advice and made it clear he would welcome an 
invitation to deliver a speech at the convention

george bush facing a tough fight to carry 
california in the fall presidential election is bidding for support 
from environmentalists by differing with the reagan administrations 
policy on offshore oil drilling 
the vice president was in california today on the eve of the 
states presidential primary he already has more than enough 
delegates for the republican presidential nomination 
a day earlier the vice president stepped away from the 
administration approach when he advocated a delay in a controversial 
project off the northern california coast 
we must be assured that the national treasure of the california 
coastline will not be harmed he said 
the administration is pushing to end the moratorium on drilling 
off the coast a position bitterly opposed by environmentalists 
opponents of ending the moratorium include many republicans 
including sen pete wilson 
the environment traditionally is a strong political issue in 
california 
in the past bush has said offshore drilling must adhere to 
strict environmental standards but he has not opposed the 
administration plan to end the moratorium 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff told reporters on the flight 
to california that the vice president was not advocating continuing 
an absolute moratorium 
bush limited his difference on the question to lease sale 91 a 
large area off the northern coast 
it appears that drilling in this environmentally precious area 
would not add substantially to our energy reserves he said 
during remarks at the dedication of the nations first commercial 
methanol fuel pump at a gasoline station 
methanol is an alternative fuel derived from coal and natural 
gas bush said methanol offers better cleaner performance than 
gasoline at no greater cost however cars must be adapted to use

wayne lapierre of the national rifle 
association says 70 senators and 260 representatives have never 
voted against the gun lobbys positions but a lastminute nra 
aboutface is probably responsible for preserving that record 
i think their influence has deteriorated some says sen j 
james exon a conservative nebraska democrat with a long record of 
backing the nra his view is shared by the nras traditional 
opponents like handgun control inc and nras more recent 
antagonists the nations major law enforcement organizations 
exon who parted with the organization over a bill to ban plastic 
guns that could escape detection at airport metal detectors said a 
recent meeting he had with lapierre subtly communicated that point 
as the nras political chief lapierre makes frequent visits to 
capitol hill but exon says their meeting on may 27 was anything but 
routine 
the nra never apologizes for the harsh attacks it makes on 
lawmakers opposing its positions but here was lapierre according 
to exons recollection admitting the group had gone too far in 
attacking him for breaking ranks 
lapierre director of the nras institute for legislative action 
denies his comments to exon amounted to an apology and rejects any 
view that the progun group has lost a step 
our base is as good as gold lapierre says were going to 
be in good shape as long as there are 70 million americans who own 
guns and 25 million who hunt there are 70 senators and 260 house 
members who have never voted against us 
but exon described a different mood they indicated to me they 
had fallen down badly in communications they said they were going 
to do everything they could to remedy that they said they may have 
overreacted in the type of advertising and letterwriting to my 
constituents 
while exon believes the nra has lost influence by attacking its 
friends the groups political opponents cite other reasons for 
their view among them 
the nras switch from opposition to support of the bill to ban 
undetectable plastic guns legislation that is a top priority of gun 
control and police groups and is sponsored by nra nemesis sen 
howard m metzenbaum dohio 
the nra changed its mind after police groups successfully lobbied 
attorney general edwin meese iii to support their version of the 
measure shaking the nras solid core of support in congress 
lapierre says the nra switched only after new language made clear 
the bill would ban only still nonexistent plastic handguns not 
existing metal pistols a victory for the nra lapierre says 
a stunning gun control triumph in maryland where gov william 
donald schaefer in a ceremony with some 200 police officers signed 
a bill may 27 to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as saturday 
night specials 
lapierre said the nras supporters have begun an effort 
successful in its early stages to place a repeal referendum on the 
ballot 
the minnesota senate judiciary committees defeat of an 
nrabacked constitutional amendment proposal to clarify the right to 
keep and bear arms also the failure of the nra in wisconsin to win 
passage of legislation that would have prohibited local governments 
from passing any gun control law stricter than state law 
lapierre contends that state legislatures passed 18 nrabacked 
bills in 1986 24 last year and 13 so far this year theres only 
one gun control bill thats gone through and thats in maryland 
he says it was our agenda being discussed in state legislatures 
not the other sides 
in the 1986 congressional elections not a single incumbent 
targeted for defeat by the nra lost his or her seat 
lapierre its very tough to defeat incumbents in congress 
these days most members of congress who vote for gun control are in 
safe districts and nobodys going to beat them there are few 
competitive districts left where the gun issue is the major 
issue 
in recent congressional battles and numerous state gun control 
fights the nra and police groups have clashed bitterly this has 
given state lawmakers and members of congress a political escape 
hatch allowing them to oppose the nra by supporting their local 
police 
i dont see their relationship with police as ever being very 
good again says jerald vaughn executive director of the 
international association of chiefs of police 
lapierre says he held meetings recently with three or four 
members of congress people who we felt were confused over the 
early version of the plastic gun bill theyre still friends of 
the nra 
lapierres view of his meeting with exon i view it as 
informational if information is fencemending and fencemending is 
information i guess you could interchange them 
vaughn says of the nra they are by no means out of the 
picture but there are signs their stranglehold on this 
administration and congress is starting to loosen a bit theres a 
growing recognition in law enforcement the nra is an organization 
out of control but politically theyre a savvy organization they 
make sure theyre never in a position of having to admit defeat 
nt pete shields chairman of handgun control inc says the 
entry of law enforcement groups into the fray has been crucial 
the nra used to call us bleedingheart communists soft on 
criminals shields says now the whole law enforcement 
community the guys on the firing line on the street is behind it 
the fight to control guns its not credible to think of those 
people as bleedingheart liberal communists

the 1988 primaries began with a bang of 
forceful and often negative television advertising but they are 
ending with a whimper in california where the winners of tuesdays 
presidential contests are a foregone conclusion 
vice president george bush with a lock on the republican 
nomination isnt running any tv commercials at all in the state 
with the biggest bloc of delegates at stake 
and massachusetts gov michael dukakis running far ahead on the 
democratic side expects to spend no more than a paltry 200000 on 
advertising 
the only candidate mounting a substantial media effort is 
underdog jesse jackson who is spending 700000 on television 
commercials all over the state plus airing a halfhour show 
tonight on the eve of the primary 
dukakis with a 20point lead over jackson in a poll last week 
is limiting his advertising to los angeles and san francisco 
for those democrats who are already interested in the election 
and planning to vote we would hope that a tv buy even this modest 
would catch their attention and provide some information said 
dukakis strategist tom kiley we dont have any illusions we 
dont pretend that advertising is playing a major role in the 
campaign 
the dukakis campaign is running a biography and two antidrug ads 
as well as radio spots some in spanish aimed at the black and 
hispanic communities 
one tv ad features dukakis saying he wants to wage a real war 
not a phony war against drug and alcohol dependence in this 
country the chief executive can make a difference in the war 
against drugs ive done it in my state and i want to do it for 
every state in this country 
dukakis is also using a companion ad in which an announcer 
describes the massachusetts program and quotes federal agents as 
calling it a model for the nation he did it with hard work 
integrity leadership we could use some of that in the white 
house 
despite the clear focus on november both kiley and alixe glen a 
spokeswoman for bush said the ads do not give dukakis an early edge 
over the vice president in a state that will be pivotal in the 
general election 
our advertising is so modest that it would be unrealistic to 
think it would have any measurable impact in terms of creating an 
advantage over bush or even having a really significant impact on 
the primary outcome kiley said 
glen said bush would counter any minimal effect of the dukakis 
ads through personal appearances in the state 
bush has spent all but a fraction of the 27 million legally 
permitted for primary contestants and cannot afford to campaign in 
any substantial way until after his partys convention in august 
but glen said the financial crunch did not figure in bushs 
decision to forgo a television effort in california that was in 
large part due to the fact that we have not had an opponent for so 
long in the republican party she said 
jacksons initial hopes of a california upset have faded but he 
is making a major push with an eye toward holding a strong hand at 
the democratic convention next month 
jacksons ads are running on cable independent and network 
affiliate stations in fresno los angeles el centro sacramento 
salinas redding santa barbara bakersfield palm springs san 
jose san francisco eureka monterey san diego and reno nev 
campaign manager gerald austin said jackson started a new tv ad 
campaign saturday to raise money to pay off bills and cover 
convention expenses the 30second spot airing in california 
features a still photo of jackson and an 800number that viewers can 
call to pledge money or put a contribution on their credit card to 
keep hope alive austin said 
other jackson spots are familiar including one touting jacksons 
success in winning the release of an american pilot shot down in the 
middle east an ad called we need him features farmers and is 
showing in rural areas actress eileen brennan praises jacksons 
stands on womens issues in another spot 
jackson caps his california push tonight with a halfhour show in 
all 15 markets a program variously described by jackson aides as a 
retrospective a celebration and an update it will feature campaign 
footage and a celebrity interviewing jackson along with a pitch for 
votes and money 
it will give people an update on what the campaign has 
achieved said spokesman eric easter we want people to vote for 
him with knowledge beyond what the media says it will give our 
perspective on him and the campaign

clarence m pendleton chairman of the us 
civil rights commission and one of the highestranking black 
officials in government died sunday after collapsing while 
exercising officials said he was 57 
pendleton died about 11 am at mission bay hospital after 
efforts failed to revive him said deputy coroner david lodge 
pendleton was believed to have suffered a heart attack lodge said 
president reagan selected pendleton an opponent of affirmative 
action quotas and busing to head the commission in november 1981 
after firing arthur s flemming flemming the chairman since 1974 
criticized reagans civil rights policies as in conflict with the 
constitution 
the bipartisan civil rights commission monitors the enforcement 
of civil rights laws within the federal government it lacks 
policymaking or enforcement powers and serves only as an advisory 
body 
a white house spokesman bill harlow said he was aware that 
pendleton had died but said the white house wouldnt have any 
comment until the morning 
hes going to be missed civil rights commission member 
robert a destro said i dont think its going to make any 
difference whether people agreed with him or disagreed with him he 
was a great human being he was a very dynamic person 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson said pendleton 
was an outstanding public servant and like any american he had 
the right to express his point of view which may not have been a 
mainstream point of view 
pendleton stirred wrath by calling liberal black leaders the 
new racists whose support for the democratic party led blacks 
into a political jonestown he described the concept of comparable 
worth as the looniest idea since looney tunes and said that 
relieving ones poverty is not civil rights 
he criticized the civil rights restoration act passed earlier 
this year over president reagans veto as an unwarranted invasion 
by big brother 
he also called affirmative actions divisive unpopular and 
immoral and opposed federal setaside contracts for minorityowned 
businesses 
pendleton often was at odds with other commission members the 
commission voted 51 in 1982 to state that there had been 
retrenchment and retreat in all areas of civil rights enforcement 
pendleton was the lone dissenter 
in june 1982 pendleton argued there was little reagan or any 
president could do for urban areas until the economy and american 
productivity improved 
i believe in the trickle down theory because it prosperity 
doesnt trickle up he said 
pendleton maintained that black citizens must make it on the 
merits of their own abilities without any special preference or 
apologies from the government or the white power structure 
he made a practice of giving socalled uncivil rights awards 
to those whose actions furthered discrimination as he defined it 
the most recent went to chicago mayor eugene sawyer last month for 
delaying the firing of an aide who made antisemitic remarks 
pendleton lived in the affluent community of la jolla about 10 
miles north of downtown san diego with his second wife margrit 
and their young daughter 
he commuted to washington dc and also frequently gave 
speeches around the country 
pendleton battled high blood pressure for years police chief 
bill kolender said after talking to mrs pendleton whom he 
described as distraught upset obviously 
pendleton was alone at the hilton beach and tennis resort riding 
a stationary cycle when he collapsed about 10 am said gary 
lingley director of the hotels tennis club pendleton a san diego 
resident was a member of the health club lingley said 
two members heard a small noise a scream maybe we dont know 
what it was lingley said about a minute later when they 
walked into the health club they saw him lying face down by the 
exercycles he had fallen unconscious 
lingley said the club members called for help and he arrived at 
the scene in about 15 seconds and began giving pendleton 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation a doctor who was a hotel guest 
assisted until the paramedics arrived he said 
an avid jogger and swimmer he once taught physical education at 
the college level and worked as a government recreation director in 
washington and baltimore being named director of the model cities 
department in san diego in 1972 he was president of the urban 
league in san diego from 1975 until 1982 
pendleton graduated from howard university in washington dc 
in 1954 and after serving in the army he returned to earn a masters 
degree in education 
pendleton was married oct 10 1970 to margrit krause according 
to the federal staff directory their three children were listed as 
george wallace susan adele and paula denise

the federal home loan bank board will pay more 
than 1 billion in insurance to depositors when it liquidates one or 
more savings institutions in what will be the largest such payout 
ever according to a published report 
the bank boards chairman danny wall declined on sunday to name 
the savings and loan institutions that are to be liquidated the new 
york times reported in mondays editions 
he said the details of the action would be announced monday in 
washington 
but savings industry officials told the times they expected the 
liquidations to be in california 
the orange county register a southern california newspaper 
reported sunday that federal regulators would be quickly arranging 
a cure for the american diversified savings bank and the north 
american savings and loan two troubled institutions in costa mesa 
calif 
wall and other bank board officials declined to comment on that 
report according to the times 
the liquidation will be the largest payout of this type wall 
said liquidation was a last resort he added taken only after such 
measures as a merger with a healthier institution could not be 
achieved 
a spokesman for the bank board karl t hoyle said the 
institutions to be liquidated had very highyielding accounts 
american diversified and north american savings are known to offer 
among the highest interest rates in the region 
the bank board oversees 3200 savings institutions last month 
the general accounting office the investigating arm of congress 
estimated that more than 500 were insolvent and more than 200 
hopelessly insolvent 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp which provides 
insurance for depositors in savings institutions does not have 
sufficient funds to cover deposits in all those institutions 
last year congress authorized the board to raise up to 108 
billion by selling bonds over the next three years to assist 
insolvent savings and loan institutions

the first visit to moscow by a us president in 14 
years was overshadowed in the staterun media by a spirited 
discussion of domestic politics a debate that brought unprecedented 
developments and raised issues not heard since the 1920s 
the argument is over a nationwide communist party conference 
starting june 28 that is shaping up as a battleground for supporters 
of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and the midlevel managers who 
oppose them 
entrenched bureaucrats fear the soviet leaders campaign to end 
party oversight of the daytoday details of governing and economic 
planning and give the people a greater role sociologist tatyana 
zaslavskaya said in an interview printed saturday by the newspaper 
izvestia 
a senior western diplomat said they have not debated issues as 
basic as this since the 1920s when the tyranny of josef stalin 
began 
last week gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater 
openness was giving both the soviet people and the west an 
unprecedented look at the internal soviet debate 
in a week of firsts 
on saturday may 28 soviet television carried what is believed 
to be the first live broadcast of the presidium of the supreme 
soviet the nations parliament formally ratifying the treaty to 
scrap intermediaterange nuclear missiles which had been signed at 
the december summit 
president reagan arrived the next day becoming the first us 
president since gerald ford to visit the soviet union 
ousted politburo member boris n yeltsin in unprecedented 
interviews last monday with us and british broadcasters attacked 
politburo member yegor k ligachev as the main person 
responsible for slowing down the reforms 
that was only the beginning 
the moscow news reported that same day that vandals had smashed a 
jewish cemetery west of the capital and jewish residents said they 
feared rising antisemitism an unwelcome byproduct of greater 
openness 
throughout the week reform advocates held news conferences for 
western journalists covering the summit disclosing a fight over 
delegate selection to the party conference 
reformers said they had been nominated by grassroots party 
organizations but were vetoed at next level giving the western 
press an unprecedented look inside soviet politics 
on tuesday reagan was asked whether he still thought the soviet 
union was an evil empire and responded i was talking about 
another time another era 
wednesday gorbachev became the first soviet communist party 
leader to give a news conference on soviet soil he used the 
occasion to refute yeltsin 
later wednesday several dozen members of a fledgling independent 
political group the democratic union held a demonstration in 
downtown moscow to demand a multiparty system one group member 
said he thought it was the first time there was a political 
meeting without repression since shortly after the 1917 
bolshevik revolution 
on thursday reagan departed expressing deep personal regard and 
political faith in gorbachev 
friday morning ms zaslavskaya a leading reformer told western 
reporters the most pronounced advocates of perestroika were not 
selected to the party conference perestroika is gorbachevs 
restructuring of soviet life 
at midday andrei d sakharov gave a news conference at the 
foreign ministry press center his first ever under government 
auspices sakharov led the dissident movement in the soviet union 
until he was banished to the closed city of gorky in january 1980 
gorbachev telephoned him in december 1986 to invite him back to 
moscow 
on friday afternoon gorbachev waded into the fight over 
conference delegates attending a meeting of the moscow party 
executive bureau that restored the names of some but not all of 
the most outspoken reformers 
on saturday party newspapers published a fairly detailed account 
of the party meeting along with a list of the 319 delegates chosen 
from the city of moscow ms zaslavskaya was not listed but many of 
her allies were 
later saturday ligachev gave a speech dispelling reports of 
splits in the party proclaiming that all the members of the 
leadership are deeply committed to the cause of perestroika 
adversaries in the west and some people in our country too 
are making allegations about differences among the soviet 
leadership in the politburo trying to drive a wedge in the 
leadership is a notorious trick 
also saturday izvestia published a long interview with ms 
zaslavskaya in which she said the party conference the first since 
1941 should find ways to make sharp cuts in the party 
apparatus 
if the pace of change continues the next us president to visit 
moscow will find one quite different from the one reagan left behind

as soviet troops proceed with their 
withdrawal from afghanistan the war between government forces and 
anticommunist guerrillas is entering a new stage 
the ultimate test will be whether either side can muster enough 
cohesion military might and popular acceptance to impose its will 
on a nation that throughout history has resisted control by any 
central authority 
the ussupported moslem guerrillas have proved themselves adept 
at defending their home turf in the countryside but in a decade of 
fighting they have yet to capture a major city 
almost every night one or more guerrilla rockets land in or near 
kabul but these attacks seem to constitute little more than 
harassment not a battle for the capital which is still defended 
by soviet soldiers 
a western diplomat said last week that he believes the guerrillas 
could eventually triumph over the sovietstyle government but only 
if they change their methods 
the only way you can unseat this soviet client is through fifth 
column tactics psychological warfare said the diplomat who is 
not american but declined to be identified further 
millions are being spent on the mujahedeen guerrillas but 
theyre still walking around barefoot and in sneakers he said 
a clandestine radio station waging a battle for hearts and 
minds would help he said 
you could have four radio transmitters for the price of one 
stinger the usmade antiaircraft missiles the mujahedeen or 
holy warriors have used to shoot down soviet and afghan aircraft 
but there is no evidence of such a shift in tactics instead the 
guerrillas are pointing to their military triumphs 
another western diplomat said they have seized control of 19 
district towns since late april when the soviets began preparing 
for the withdrawal of roughly 100000 red army troops that began may 
15 and is to end by feb 15 
district towns are considered important because they are 
administrative and military centers all those taken by the 
guerrillas were defended by afghan soldiers not the soviets whose 
troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 
most of the seized district towns are near the border with 
pakistan where the guerrillas are based and get weapons provided by 
the united states china and other countries 
although diplomats and other observers believe some of the 
captures of district towns were genuine military victories others 
came about through tactical withdrawals 
president najib has portrayed these retreats by his soldiers as 
part of a deliberate plan to enable more than 3 million refugees to 
return home from pakistan through a demilitarized zone this may 
be a facesaving device for the government but also could be a 
calculated gamble 
if large numbers of afghan women and children start crossing the 
border husbands and fathers who are now guerrillas will have to 
make a choice to carry their battle against the government into 
territory farther from home or to join their families rebuild their 
lives and start tilling the soil again 
whos to say the mujahedeen wont think of better things to do 
than to fight for kabul a foreign diplomat asked speaking on 
condition of anonymity very very few of them have fought outside 
their home areas 
the morale and loyalty of the afghan army whose strength is 
estimated at between 40000 and 60000 men and consists largely of 
conscripts has long been suspect 
but the government has other forces who are wellarmed and better 
motivated these include an estimated 25000 to 35000 sarandoy 
paramilitary troops with a decade of demonstrated loyalty to the 
regime and khad the secret police force that has its own tanks and 
armor and is conservatively estimated at 10000 men 
in the long run the most important force may be the village 
militias who are currently on the government payroll 
foreign diplomats estimate their strength at 65000 the bulk of 
them in towns and villages around kabul 
in chahal dokhtran a village 20 miles south of kabul that is 
frequently on the governments tours for foreign journalists 
militia commander bari mangal said he had 61 men to defend the 400 
residents 
the militiamen ranged in age from early teens to late 70s and 
carried world war i vintage rifles semiautomatic kalashnikovs and 
thompson submachine guns 
their politics as translated by government officials were 
firmly progovernment and staunchly antimujahedeen but their main 
interest seemed to be keeping outsiders away from their fields and 
fortresslike mud brick houses

a set of figures compiled by the central 
intelligence agency illustrates how brilliantly the economy of japan 
has performed in the 1980s compared with those of the united states 
and western europe 
in dealing with unemployment inflation production and foreign 
trade japan outshines the others even successful west germany the 
yens value has zoomed up at the same time that japanese interest 
rates have floated gently down 
the cia makes no comment on its information its directorate of 
intelligence issues a thin pamphlet every two weeks called 
economics and energy indicators it contains only blandlooking 
tables of figures and no analysis but the latest issue summarizes 
figures in the 1980s 
japanese success goes back to the end of world war ii and its 
due to a combination of things commented jeffrey j schott of the 
private institute for international economics 
theres readiness to adjust to changing circumstances theyre 
shifting now from exports to production for home use theres 
cooperative labor and management practices and theres just hard 
work theyre all interrelated 
japanese unemployment was a little above 2 percent at the start 
of the decade it has crept up a bit but never reached 3 percent 
in this country unemployment was 96 percent in 1982 three times 
japans it was even higher for a while during that years 
recession but has fallen since then 
still the us rate as given by the cia 56 percent in 
february is still more than twice as high as japans 27 percent 
unemployment in the four biggest countries of western europe 
varied widely from west germanys 77 percent in 1982 to italys 
124 percent last year 
cia figures do not always agree with those issued by other us 
government agencies and cia officials say they come from several 
sources the labor department reported that us consumer prices 
rose 44 percent in 1987 the cia put the number at 37 percent 
there are often many ways to calculate such statistics 
on inflation the cia showed consumer prices in the united states 
rising by 62 percent in 1982 although the increase was only 37 
percent last year it is climbing again according to the agency 
western europes record is similar on average although it 
differs widely from country to country earlier in the decade these 
rates averaged somewhat higher in europe than in the united states 
by 1987 the average was nearly the same 
but in japan the inflation rate never reached 3 percent last 
year japanese consumers paid an average of only onetenth of 1 
percent over the level of 1986 in 1988 prices are falling fairly 
sharply with the drop in february at an annual rate of 24 percent 
in 1982 the united states bought foreign goods worth 32 billion 
more than what it could sell abroad though for a while that year 
its trade was almost in balance imports rose so fast in the rest of 
the 1980s that in 1987 the us international trade deficit amounted 
to a record 153 billion 
japan started with a trade surplus of 19 billion in 1982 and 
rocketed to a record of 96 billion in 1987 the level drooped a 
little early last year but rose again through february 
the japanese performance wouldnt look so brilliant if our own 
had not been so unbrilliant said robert solomon of the brookings 
institution a major washington research group 
japans big growth was based on exports how big would it have 
been except for the us budget deficit 
western europe had a small but rising trade surplus since 1985 
due largely to west germanys record export sales britain france 
and italy all had deficits in their world trade last year as they 
have steadily throughout the decade

smith amp wesson the american gun manufacturer 
that three years ago lost a battle to produce the militarys primary 
handgun is again trying to win the armys business in a new 
contract competition ordered by congress 
beretta an italian company that produces its m9 pistol in 
maryland won out over the massachusettsbased smith amp wesson in the 
1985 competition 
manufacturers of 9mm automatic pistols including smith amp wesson 
beretta and sturm ruger amp co of connecticut have been invited by 
the army to submit 30 sample guns each by aug 17 
the contract for 146000 guns with an estimated value of more 
than 30 million is expected to be awarded next year 
of potentially equal significance to the companies is that many 
civilian and police purchasers tend to follow the armys lead 
analysts say 
before the army contract the only americans familiar with 
beretta were readers of james bond said robert i hass a 
senior vice president at smith amp wesson it put beretta on the 
map he said 
beretta won the 75 million 1985 contract to produce 316000 9mm 
guns to replace the colt 45 the standard us military sidearm 
since 1911 
the army had no intention of holding a new contract competition 
for the next order but following the 1986 death of rep joseph 
addabbo dny chairman of the house appropriations defense 
subcommittee and leading beretta supporter massachusetts reps 
edward boland and silvio conte pushed through a measure ordering the 
new competition 
boland is the no 2 democrat and conte is the top republican on 
the appropriations committee 
under the congressional mandate the army asked companies to 
submit test samples last year but exempted beretta saying the m9 
was tested regularly by the army maj phil soucy said in december 
that requiring beretta tests would be a stupid waste of taxpayer 
money 
smith amp wesson cried foul claiming the armys new 9mm order was 
substantially different from the guns now being produced by beretta 
and therefore the italian company should be required to submit test 
models 
when the army did not change its position smith amp wesson refused 
to enter the competition and appealed to the general accounting 
offices comptroller general the congressional agency ruled in 
february and again in april that the army should retest beretta if 
it wants to retest the smith amp wesson weapon 
army officials sent out a notice last month that a new 
competition would be held and all companies including beretta 
would be subject to testing smith amp wesson officials now say they 
will compete

a former aide to house speaker jim wright says 
in an interview published today that he spent about 200 hours of 
congressional office time working on wrights book reflections of 
a public man 
the book and wrights royalties from it have sparked calls for 
an ethics committee investigation of the house speaker 
former wright aide matthew cossolotto who worked for the texas 
democrat from 1983 until early this year told the washington post 
he spent about 200 hours working on the book project during office 
hours 
he said he also flew to fort worth texas and spent almost three 
weeks doing final editing on the book with wrights publishers 
cossolotto said that at the time he was working on the book he 
received no other compensation besides his congressional salary of 
about 27000 
cossolotto said he became a little uncomfortable as the 
project went along but he was not clearly aware of house rules 
that say congressional compensation is only for official duties 
wright told the newspaper that cossolottos work on the book was 
proper and that the amount of time the aide spent on the project 
was rather negligible 
if he gave some time to try to help put together a book that 
would demonstrate to the public my philosophy my basic beliefs 
that wouldnt be too far afield from the public business he said 
a complaint filed with the house ethics committee by rep newt 
gingrich rga cited newspaper reports that wright received 
unusually high royalties for the book which was published by a 
texas associate who also received nearly 300000 in business from 
wrights campaign 
the book is a compilation of wrights speeches and anecdotes it 
was published by carlos moore who was paid more than 250000 by 
the congressmans campaign committee during the same 198586 period 
in which wright was earning royalties on the book 
gingrichs complaint supported by 73 other house republicans 
also cited actions by wright on behalf of texas oilmen with whom he 
had a financial relationship 
common cause a nonpartisan watchdog group also has called for 
an ethics investigation and vice president george bush has called 
for a special prosecutor to investigate wrights dealings 
the ethics committee began deliberations thursday on whether to 
investigate gingrichs allegations and is to continue its 
discussions this week

themselves without going off every month or so one is revealed by 
excavation and the army has to defuse it and then take it away and

president daniel ortega says the key to 
success of this weeks peace talks with nicaraguan rebels lies with 
the reagan administration 
we hold the united states government responsible for what 
happens in these meetings with the contras the president said 
sunday after meeting with labor leaders who support his leftist 
sandinista government 
government officials and leaders of the ussupported nicaraguan 
resistance the contra umbrella organization are scheduled to meet 
tuesday through thursday in managua to attempt to forge a lasting 
peace 
it would mark the fourth occasion the combatants in the 
7yearold civil war have met in the nicaraguan capital to discuss a 
definitive truce 
the contra delegation planned to travel today to san jose costa 
rica to prepare for the talks said a rebel spokesman in a 
telephone interview from miami on sunday he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
ortega said the reagan administration would be to blame if the 
contras did not agree to end the war and lay down their arms 
in the event the talks fell through he added we will be 
obliged to confront this terrorist policy with all the firmness and 
force with which we have confronted it for all of these years 
the rebels trained funded and supplied by the united states 
began their war to overthrow the sandinistas in 1981 
ortega said his government would offer no variations to its 
peace proposal submitted during the last round of negotiations held 
may 2628 
during that session the government agreed to discuss contra 
demands for political changes they say would bring about 
democratization in nicaragua those include freedom of the 
press an end to the ruling sandinista national liberation fronts 
control over the armed forces and the government and electoral and 
judicial reforms 
the contras rejected a government proposal for a 30day extension 
of the twomonth truce that began april 1 and a plan for delivering 
humanitarian aid to rebel units gathered inside truce zones 
the ceasefire was set to lapse on may 31 but both sides agreed 
to extend it at least until the end of this weeks talks ortega has 
already announced a unilateral 30day truce extension 
the rebel delegation was permitted to visit leaders of the 
domestic opposition and roman catholic church officials during the 
last round of talks ortega said sunday that they would be allowed 
to do so again this week

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis made final appeals to california voters today saying we 
may be able to lock up this nomination early and go to atlanta 
united 
dukakis was flying around the state today with stops in san 
diego san jose and los angeles a trip aimed at gaining exposure in 
each of the states major television markets on the eve of tuesdays 
primary season finale 
the massachusetts governor returned to the state sunday evening 
where he had a rally at a greek orthodox church after completing 
two days of campaigning in new jersey another of the four states 
holding primaries on the final day of delegateselection contests 
greeted warmly at the church dukakis danced a traditional greek 
dance and told supporters with your help and the help of people 
all across the country were going to win a decisive victory here in 
california in new jersey and montana and new mexico 
with a seemingly insurmountable lead over jesse jackson in the 
delegate count dukakis aides were confident he will gain the 
remaining delegates to assure his nomination by tuesdays primaries 
and the campaign can turn its attention to the important selection 
of a running mate 
aboard his campaign plane on the flight west dukakis said he 
would turn his focus to choosing a vice presidential candidate after 
tuesday he said the search would be led by the top officials of his 
campaign 
dukakis said his priority will be choosing someone who would be 
qualified to be president if needed and that only after that 
qualification is met would he look at political considerations such 
as the persons geographic region expertise and other 
considerations 
dukakis has more than 1800 delegates toward the 2081 needed for 
a delegate majority at the democratic national convention in atlanta 
with jackson his only remaining rival and a dukakis nomination 
assumed voter turnout remains his big concern and dukakis urged 
voters at a series of stops in new jersey not to forget to vote 
tuesday is very important and please dont let anybody think 
this is over dukakis said 
he added that with wins in the two big states voting tuesday and 
the smaller states of montana and new mexico we may be able to 
lock up this nomination early and go to atlanta united 
confident the dukakis campaign has aired no television ads in 
new jersey and few in california 
already the dukakis campaign is working on its fall campaign 
against republican george bush and dukakis touched on themes aimed 
at suburban swing voters many of whom have gone with president 
reagan and the republicans in the last two elections in new jersey 
he emphasized family values and economic policies that recognize the 
changing needs of families with two working spouses and children who 
need day care 
in paterson an older industrial city dukakis called for federal 
and state investment in urban revitalization citing the example of 
the economic rebirth of lowell mass in his state dukakis did 
not however shed further light on how this investment would be 
paid for beyond his previous calls for providing modest sums of 
money to encourage private development projects 
in jersey city across the river from new york city dukakis 
stressed the themes of affordable housing and blasted the reagan 
administration for what he said was a 90 percent cutback in federal 
support for public housing assistance to low and moderateincome 
families he said its no wonder the nation faces a problem of 
homelessness 
dukakis responded to indications from jackson that he intends to 
continue campaigning up to the convention pressing his issues 
dukakis said he saw no harm but added that he expects jackson to 
work for the ticket in the fall 
its not harmful at all the massachusetts governor said 
hes a very strong person whos done an extraordinary job of 
winning votes and winning support 
i hope and believe were going to have a good relationship we 
have in the past he said i suspect hes going to be out there 
campaigning hard for the democratic ticket this fall

quarantine aids victims close a 
nuclear plant create a new county limit campaign spending 
these are some of the questions to be decided tuesday by voters 
in california where controversial ballot issues have long been a 
part of the political landscape 
this years primary ballot offers two competing options for 
capping campaign spending and two others for modifying the spending 
limit on state and local government imposed by a 1979 initiative 
sponsored by political activist paul gann 
the statewide ballot also carries a proposition that would 
stiffen penalties for seconddegree murder when the victim is a 
police officer 
state bond measures would provide 32 billion for 
transportation schools home loans for veterans earthquakesafe 
buildings and park land purchases 
the 776 million generalobligation bond issue for the purchase 
and development of parks and lands that support endangered species 
is the first bond measure placed on californias ballot through the 
initiative or signaturegathering process in modern times 
proponents adopted the strategy after state lawmakers defeated 
three park bond proposals in 1986 
also among the bond proposals is gov george deukmejians 1 
billion measure for highway construction and improvement although 
it was placed on the ballot by the legislature it is opposed by 
several lawmakers 
local ballots carry two hotly debated county measures 
in sacramento voters could become the first in the nation to 
close a nuclear power plant when they consider two measures on the 
fate of troubled rancho seco 25 miles southeast of the capital 
votersponsored measure b would order the plants immediate and 
permanent closure the rival measure c sponsored by the municipal 
utility that operates rancho seco asks voters to allow the plant to 
operate on a trial basis for at least 18 months as long as utility 
directors approve its performance 
in san bernardino the nations largest county voters will 
decide whether to carve away a portion and create a new mojave 
county proponents of the new county which would be mostly desert 
say fourfifths of the 11 million residents are jammed into the far 
eastern edge of san bernardino county and have different concerns 
than those who want to secede 
california also has a us senate primary as do new mexico new 
jersey and montana in addition montana has a primary in both 
parties for governor 
the most emotionally charged of californias ballot measures 
proposition 69 is virtually identical to a 1986 antiaids ballot 
measure that voters defeated by a margin of more than 2to1 
proposition 69 backed by supporters of extremist lyndon 
larouche would require health officials to report to the state 
health department the names of people with aids and those testing 
positive for the virus 
it would add acquired immune deficiency syndrome to the states 
list of communicable diseases making both groups subject to 
possible quarantine 
proponents say the measure is needed to control the deadly 
disease but opponents have harshly criticized it 
the intent of proposition 69 is not to help people help 
themselves but rather to identify and separate people from their 
support networks says ron braithwaite president of the alice b 
toklas lesbian and gay democratic club in san francisco 
also heavily contested on the statewide ballot are propositions 
68 and 73 aimed at controlling rising expenditures by political 
candidates 
supporters of both say incumbents and challengers depend on large 
contributions from special interests who then have influence over 
the candidates who are elected 
proposition 68 supported by publicinterest groups would 
authorize partial public financing for legislative candidates who 
abide by limits on donations and campaign spending 
the competing measure proposition 73 which is supported by 
state lawmakers would impose limits on contributions and impose a 
ban on any public financing for candidates 
supporters of two other conflicting initiatives propositions 71 
and 72 which would alter the gann government spending limit agree 
on little except that the limit needs modification to some degree 
the spending ceiling approved by voters nine years ago in a 
gannsponsored initiative that followed the historic taxcutting 
proposition 13 ties annual expenditures to population growth and 
cost of living 
it allows state and local government spending to increase no more 
than the lower of either the us consumer price index or california 
percapita personal income

in my opinion he acknowledged he had done it and he did it 
because he had strong feelings on this and felt alumni should have 
their say dr michael l charney said sunday he also said he 
had given yale a lot of money 
charney a boston psychiatrist and class of 1968 said that while 
jogging across the campus sunday morning he saw a man running away 
from the fire 
i yelled fire and ran after him charney said he was in 
a tan suit tie and his class button which he took off as he ran 
charney said he caught the man dr elwood d bracey in the 
courtyard of one of yales residential colleges where the two had a 
political discussion about south africa apartheid and yales 
investment policies 
bracey who apparently was visiting the campus for alumni 
weekend said hed worked for three months at a south african 
hospital and was a vietnam veteran charney said 
bracey of west palm beach fla was charged with firstdegree 
arson in the fire that destroyed the shantytown named winnie 
mandela city after the wife of nelson mandela the jailed south 
african antiapartheid leader 
a story published in todays editions of the palm beach post of 
west palm beach said bracey once was sued for allegedly shooting a 
neighbors doberman pinscher and kept a pet leopard for 10 years 
until it mauled his daughter 
bracey 56 a 1958 yale graduate was free on 50000 bond 
pending arraignment today in new haven superior court he could not 
be reached for comment sunday despite attempts by telephone to 
locate him at hotels 
students erected the shanties on a white granite plaza in front 
of the yale administration building in april 1986 to protest 
apartheid and yale investments in south africa officials ordered 
police to dismantle the shanties but allowed them to be rebuilt 
after students agreed to maintain them 
students occasionally slept in the shanties and capt john 
rourke head of the policefire investigative unit speculated that 
was why bracey was charged with firstdegree arson 
yale president benno c schmidt jr who during a saturday 
meeting with alumni defended the universitys decision to allow the 
shantytown to remain standing denounced the arson as a lawless 
act of violence 
to destroy them by an act of impulse is the antithesis of 
reason and order that is the essence of a university or any 
civilized community he said beyond that to set the shanties 
on fire furtively in the midst of an urban campus is an extremely 
dangerous thing to do 
all that remained of the shantytown was a pile of charred scrap 
lumber and plywood and a wooden shrine draped in the yellow green 
and black of the african national congress it was pasted with 
sheets of paper listing the names of 250 people killed in the 
struggle against apartheid the system in which south africas 
whites rule over a land where blacks are the majority 
sue ellen apte acting director of the palm beach county medical 
society described bracey as a popular doctor 
hes a wellrespected physician not the type of person who 
would do something that might have repercussions apte said 
hes not hottempered 
in its report the florida newspaper said bracey kept a pet 
leopard named lepy until 1980 when it mauled his then2yearold 
daughter blythe after the attack in which his daughter suffered a 
broken arm and scratches on her face and leg he gave the leopard to 
a zoo the post said 
the newspaper also said bracey became involved in a lawsuit for 
shooting to death a neighbors doberman in 1982 
the lawsuit was filed by the neighbor who was countersued by 
bracey because the dog allegedly intruded onto braceys property and 
destroyed his nine rabbits and a pet chicken according to the 
newspaper the two have since settled the dispute the newspaper 
said

frank nicholls says theres 
something lacking in a pint of beer served in british columbia bars 
4 ounces of beer 
nicholls an electrician says hes done his homework sampling 
pints in dozens of pubs in the province and has concluded that most 
of them dont give patrons a propersized canadian pint 
i could sue every pub in vancouver right now says 
nicholls 38 
nicholls says most city pubs and clubs sell 16ounce pints based 
on the 128ounce us gallon however the federal weights and 
measures act uses the british imperial gallon which is 160 ounces 
under federal law it is illegal to call anything under 20 ounces a 
pint 
a government official agrees with nicholls that calling a 
16ounce glass a pint is technically illegal 
thats absolutely right says archie patterson vancouver 
district manager for weights and measures the us pint is not 
legal 
but though most watering holes in the province could be charged 
under federal law patterson says ottawa has more important things 
to worry about 
weve not really been pushing in that area he said

troops today raided indian businesses and 
rounded up 40 people including a former foreign minister after 
police seized a huge shipment of sovietmade weapons apparently 
smuggled from the middle east 
krishna datt a fijian of indian descent in the ousted government 
of timoci bavadra was among those detained because he visited the 
soviet union in 1985 the ministry of information said it did not 
elaborate 
governmentcontrolled radio fiji said the arms haul included 93 
automatic rifles 10 light machine guns 300 hand grenades five 
rocketlaunchers 72 bayonets two large drums of live ammunition 
and two pistols 
it said the weapons were found at several locations near the city 
of nadi on the western side of the main island of viti levu a 
stronghold for the coalition government that was overthrown in a 
coup 13 months ago 
in suva soldiers raided at least six buildings housing indian 
businesses residents said 
police spokesman senior inspector romanu tikotikoca said 
authorities had seized a substantial portion of a shipment of 
weapons believed smuggled into the country in april he gave no 
further details 
the weapons were similar to a shipment seized in australia a week 
ago that arrived from north yemen and was destined for fiji 
australian customs officers in sydney which is 2000 miles to 
the southwest said the 16ton shipment could have been used to 
start a small war 
bavadra has denied any involvement in the gunrunning and his 
wife kuini said last week that the incident was part of a 
deliberate campaign to discredit her husband whom she said believes 
in nonviolence 
coup leader sitiveni rabuka has said the shipments were part of a 
foreign plot to destablize the nation but stopped short of accusing 
a particular country or organization 
rabuka said he staged the two coups last year to protect the 
political rights of ethnic fijians who are slightly outnumbered by 
the indian community among the 715000 residents of this former 
british colony 
radio fiji also reported today that the arms and ammunition were 
seized in raids on homes and warehouses owned by indian businessmen 
meanwhile residents said the army had increased its armed 
patrols in the capital with soldiers standing guard at all the 
premises raided 
earlier a 47yearold truck driver of indian descent was to have 
appeared in court charged with conspiring to illegally import the 
weapons shipment seized in australia last week but police postponed 
the court appearance until tuesday saying they could not guarantee 
the mans safety 
the suspect was not identified

an international panel of former judges has ruled 
that testimony given at a televised commission of inquiry would be 
too weak to convict austrian president kurt waldheim of nazi war 
crimes 
after sitting for nine days and hearing 35 witnesses including 
former german soldiers the judges ruled sunday night we conclude 
unanimously that the evidence which has been put before us is not 
enough to make probable that lt waldheim committed any of the war 
crimes alleged against him in this inquiry 
however the inquiry did find that waldheim must have 
appreciated that many more captured italian officers and hostages 
taken in yugoslavia in 1942 would be shot after he learned that a 
large number had been executed 
but he had no authority over them and on his own authority he 
could do nothing to stop the shootings the panel said 
lapses and aberrations of memory such as dr waldheim seems to 
have had about his service in greece and the balkans are not in 
themselves evidence of guilt the judges said 
waldheim 69 who served as an intelligence officer with the 
german army in greece and the balkans during the war did not come 
to london for the inquiry it failed to uncover any vital new 
witnesses or evidence against him 
the inquiry was paid for by americas home box office and 
britains thames television 
toward the end of the studio filming prosecuting lawyer allan a 
ryan acknowledged he had been unable to produce new evidence no 
investigation so far had concluded that waldheim was a war criminal 
he said 
ryan a former director of the nazihunting us office of 
special investigations argued however that the totality of evidence 
showed waldheim was not there making coffee for these criminals 
his acts facilitated their crimes 
waldheim has vigorously denied the allegations since they 
surfaced in 1986 four years after he stepped down as united nations 
secretarygeneral and 41 years after the end of world war ii 
he was alleged to have been involved in massacres of yugoslav and 
greek civilians and partisans deportation of greek jews to death 
camps and the delivery for execution of captured british commandos 
and greek resistnce fighters 
he was also accused of involvement in the burning of villages in 
yugoslavia and a notorious massacre there of about 70000 men women 
and children at kozara in 1942 
the judges decision was delivered by sir frederick lawton at the 
end of a 3hour tv film of the testimony titled waldheim a 
commission of inquiry 
we have not been asked to decide whether dr waldheim is or is 
not guilty of a crime still less has it been our function to pass a 
moral judgement upon him said the 76yearold former lord justice 
of britains appeal court 
a person does not commit a war crime merely because he knows 
others have committed such crimes nor because he worked with or 
alongside those who committed them lawton said 
his colleagues were shirley hufstedler a former circuit judge 
for the us court of appeals and exeducation secretary and west 
german walter hubner swede gustav petren and canadian gordon cooper 
ryan noted that an inquiry by a commission of historians 
concluded last february that waldheim was not a war criminal 
the world jewish congress for all their outrage has refrained 
very properly from saying that he was but you have these other 
concerns is he a liar is he a dishonorable person is he a shifty 
arrogant social climber ryan asked 
on sunday waldheim met with king fahd in saudi arabia and 
received saudi arabias highest decoration 
fahd gave the austrian president a red carpet welcome when 
waldheim arrived for a threeday state visit on saturday the king 
later hosted a banquet at which he decorated waldheim with the 
cordon of king abdelaziz the nations highest decoration

fbi agents are checking out tips from 
around the country to help determine the identity of a 
hearingimpaired boy who has repeatedly sketched images of a plane 
crash in his efforts to communicate 
the boy believed to be 7 or 8 years old was found wandering in 
juarez mexico last november officials believe the sketches may 
mean he was the only member of his family to survive a plane crash 
no solid leads had developed by late sunday although officials 
were expecting to receive the fingerprints of a missing decatur 
ill boy today said pat alcala spokeswoman for the texas 
department of human services in el paso 
once the fbi got involved things started moving faster she 
said 
the boy called sabat because he was found on a saturday or 
sabado in spanish bears some resemblance to a boy kidnapped from 
decatur in october 1985 officials said 
fbi agent terry kincaid said calls came in to his office from all 
over the country sunday and agents were checking the tips while 
trying to match the boy with descriptions of missing children 
at this time were kind of at the mercy of the public to 
provide us with some additional leads as to the identity of this 
young lad he said 
the boy is 4 feet 6 has dark blond or light brown hair and a 
freckled white complexion 
in my initial interview with him we were able to establish 
that he was involved in a plane crash and his parents died and his 
little sister died luis torre a dhs caseworker told nbc 
nightly news in an interview broadcast sunday it was not much to 
go on 
us air force representatives are reviewing pictures of the 
crash drawn by the boy in hopes of recognizing the type of aircraft 
and where it may have crashed kincaid said 
officials have said the boy also could be a child from a military 
family who lived in alaska 
the boy who originally was described as deafmute is hearing 
impaired and does not talk but can form some onesyllable words 
he has been in a child protective service center since he was 
found on the streets of juarez across the border but investigators 
suspect he may be from the united states because he prefers american 
food is familiar with us currency and is a whiz at video games 
which are unknown to many mexican children 
in february child protective services agencies in el paso and 
juarez signed an agreement to cooperate on missing children cases 
ms alcala said 
social workers from mexico and el paso have learned the boy comes 
from an area where there is kneedeep snow heavy rainfall 
mountains and trees his father who may have been a military man 
was missing four fingers on his right hand and had a mustache 
the boys story has received national attention since thursday 
when the dhs released a report on him 
the air force plans to review records of downed planes and look 
for any correlations with sabats sketches kincaid said 
the boys pictures of a crashed airplane include the numbers 
28d 23 written under the airplane the boy has pointed to scars 
on his left knee stomach and back and then pointed to a drawing of 
himself walking away from the crash 
the scars led doctors to believe that if they had been caused by 
a crash it would have been two to three years ago 
but kincaid said authorities are not sure the drawings pertain to 
the boy we have no idea how much of his sketches are his own idea 
or his imagination or maybe recreations of popular television 
shows he said

two nuns claimed a victory for all 
women after roman catholic church officials backed down from their 
threat to expel the nuns for publicly supporting the right to 
abortions 
however the vatican still could take action against sisters 
barbara ferraro and patricia hussey who run a shelter for the 
homeless in charleston according to catholics for a free choice a 
dissident catholic group 
the nuns order the general government group of the sisters of 
notre dame denamur said saturday in a statement from rome that it 
will not proceed with the process to dismiss ferraro and hussey 
dismissal would not be in the best interest of the church or 
the religious congregation at this time the order said 
this decision to halt the process of dismissal is not to be 
interpreted as support for or agreement with the public statements 
which have been made by sisters barbara and patricia according to 
the statement read over the telephone to the nuns by officials of 
the order in rome 
the sisters of notre dame disclaim any public statetment on 
abortion made by these two sisters 
the nuns have been under threat of dismissal since signing an 
oct 7 1984 advertisement in the new york times that said a 
diversity of opinion exists among committed catholics on the issue 
of abortion 
the advertisement noted the churchs view that abortion is always 
wrong and added there is a mistaken belief in american society 
that this is the only legitimate catholic position 
we are elated this is an enormous victory for all women the 
two nuns said in a statement released through the washingtonbased 
dissent group 
the nuns who had said they expected to be expelled after being 
given two warnings to disavow their support for abortion could not 
be reached for comment sunday they scheduled a news conference for 
thursday in washington 
hussey has been a member of the order for 20 years ferraro for 
25 years 
ferraro has claimed that the aim of the vatican for years has 
been to silence strong independent womens communities and strong 
independent women 
theres no question its a very important victory for all 
women frances kissling head of the dissident group said sunday 
we felt it was very important that if anyone was going to act 
against barbara and pat it should be the vatican not the order 
it should not be women expelling women 
kissling said the sisters of notre dame gave no other indication 
why they decided not to expel the nuns 
that is essentially what they have had to say she said of 
the statement released by the vatican 
ferraro and hussey were among 97 catholics including 22 other 
nuns and four priests who signed the advertisement which was 
written by kisslings group 
the other nuns and priests who signed it retracted their 
statement and have had their cases closed by rome without punitive 
action against anyone kissling said

william reeda schumachers childhood dream was 
delayed until his own children were grown but now the oldest man to 
become a roman catholic priest in america is ready to minister to a 
much larger family 
schumacher who has six children 13 grandchildren and one 
greatgrandchild was ordained saturday just 24 days short of his 
80th birthday he celebrated his first mass sunday 
what hes taught all of us is theres nothing you cant do if 
you really want to do it he believes that said fran lipton 
schumachers 48yearold daughter who was among 300 people 
attending the service with her five brothers and several of the new 
priests grandchildren 
wearing a simple white robe the bespectacled whitehaired 
schumacher was ordained into the priesthood by bishop thomas 
tschoepe of dallas who gave schumacher a chance after he was 
rejected by scores of other church leaders because of his age 
schumacher said he felt nothing special about making church 
history 
being a priest is all that concerned me he said after the 
ceremony at his home parish st tarcissus roman catholic church on 
the citys northwest side 
schumacher took steps to attend a seminary when he was 17 but 
deferred his plans to care for his widowed mother he later got 
married and had a family of his own 
a few weeks after his wife genevieve died in 1984 after 52 
years of marriage schumacher telephoned the chicago archdiocese and 
said he wanted to be a priest 
the kids were all taking care of themselves he explained 
i was then free to do what i originally wanted to do 
but officials in chicago turned him down saying he was 35 years 
beyond the cutoff age of 40 for archdiocesan sponsorship of a priest 
after 49 dioceses either rejected or ignored his letters 
tschoepe promised to give him an assignment 
tschoepes backing allowed schumacher to enter the seminary and 
in may he graduated from holy apostles seminary in cromwell conn 
bill impresses me as a vigorous man of about 60 or so said 
the 72yearold tschoepe 
a man almost 80 years old can be a good priest the bishop 
said with the experience they have they can be very very 
effective especially in counseling and their understanding of what 
other people are going through is one of ive been there 
schumacher will begin his service in dallas but requested to be 
ordained in his neighborhood church where he had been a lay leader 
for 31 years 
as a priest schumachers main responsibilities will be working 
with the elderly and sick people 
i think i have a rapport with people older like myself and i 
know i have a rapport with people who are ill schumacher said 
schumacher pursued various careers including insurance broker 
politician credit manager and job counselor for the state of 
illinois 
after retiring from his government job at age 68 schumacher 
became a travel agent a career he continued until he applied for 
seminary mrs lipton said 
as i was watching the service i thought my mother would have 
been proud to be there but of course if she was there he wouldnt 
have been she said

lotto 649 at a market near sacramento the other at a liquor store 
in fairfield each will get about 1 million a year for the next two 
decades

theyve got said jeanne robinson of fairfield 45 miles 
northeast of san francisco theres a lot of people whod like to

the candidate representing mexicos socialist 
party has withdrawn from the presidential race and thrown his 
support to a politician who heads a breakaway faction of the 
governing party 
heberto castillo stepped down as the socialist candidate and 
publicly endorsed cuauhtemoc cardenas in the july 6 presidential 
elections 
on sunday gilberto rincon gallardo secretary general of the 
socialist party said the government party reacted to the decision 
with enormous disgust and was preparing to strike at the 
leftist coalition now unified behind cardenas 
the socialist party is mexicos second largest opposition group 
cardenas whose popularity has risen sharply among the left 
accepted castillos endorsement while campaigning in the gulf coast 
state of veracruz 
it is a great honor and a high responsibility for me to be the 
mexican socialist party candidate he told reporters friday night 
he said he had accepted the socialists 12plank platform 
rincon gallardo denied on sunday that the socialists decision 
was opportunistic if we were in circumstances of weakness unity 
would not be worth it he told reporters in remarks carried by the 
excelsior news agency 
the socialists generally finish in third place in elections 
behind the governing institutional revolutionary party or pri and 
the conservative national action party 
but in this years campaign some polls indicate cardenas is 
trailing only carlos salinas de gortari the pri candidate the pri 
has not lost a presidential or gubernatorial election since it was 
founded in 1929 
cardenas heads the national democratic front coalition which 
includes the authentic party of the mexican revolution originally a 
pri spinoff two smaller leftist parties and followers of the 
democratic current reform movement he led within the pri last year 
he broke away from the pri when the party refused to accept a 
platform that called for open primaries to choose candidates for 
elections the pri traditionally selects its candidates in closed 
session 
the son of the late president lazaro cardenas one of mexicos 
most revered politicians cuauhtemoc cardenas served as governor of 
the west coast state of michoacan

pravda said today residents thought war had broken 
out when a freight train packed with 120 tons of explosives blew up 
at a rail crossing in a city near gorky killing at least 68 people 
and injuring 230 
first i saw a high column of flames shoot up then i heard a 
rumbling and then a great mushroom cloud rose the official 
communist party daily quoted a witness v dormidontov as saying 
soviet news reports said saturdays blast in arzamas an 
industrial city about 240 miles east of moscow flattened several 
city blocks and tossed railroad cars and other vehicles like 
feathers 
dozens of doctors were rushed to the city and rescue workers 
continued today to go through the debris and pravda said the true 
death toll may never be known in some areas all that was left from 
the blast were car wheels or rubble from multistoried apartment 
buildings todays paper added 
soviet media said the blast involved three boxcars packed with 
industrial explosives and destroyed the homes of 600 people at 
least eight children were among those killed 
the official medias reporting of the disaster was among its most 
detailed and rapid ever about such an accident an apparent sign of 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness 
what shocked arzamas residents pravda said was not the damaged 
houses or destroyed cars but the crippled people calling for help 
the newspaper quoted one unidentified weeping woman as saying 
the first thing that came to my mind was has it started an 
apparent reference to war 
witnesses said the explosion was so powerful that windows were 
shattered about 1 miles away and sections of track were discovered 
a mile from the accident site the news reports said 
pravda described the scene as being one of brief panic but 
said those who were not injured quickly rushed to help victims 
more than 80 doctors were flown to arzamas a city of more than 
90000 people nearby residents rushed to offer blood and food for 
the survivors the media said 
pravda said the death toll would probably mount how is it 
possible to determine how many people were killed in cars parked 
nearby 
it noted that in some cases only wheels were left at the site 
the story appeared on the back page of todays paper there were no 
photographs 
a government commission was appointed to investigate the accident 
the three boxcars carried industrial explosives intended for 
geologists mineworkers and builders tass said sunday the diesel 
locomotive pulling the cars flipped over in the blast the daily 
izvestia noted in its sunday editions 
cars and trucks halted near the track waiting for the train to 
pass were scattered about as though they were feathers 
izvestia said 
the explosion set off small fires that were quickly extinguished 
and derailed other freight cars it said 
transport and municipal services also were damaged tass said 
those left homeless would get new apartments and compensation for 
damages 
it was the most serious train accident reported since august 
1987 when soviet media said scores of people were killed after a 
freight train collided with a passenger train in southern russia 
accidents were never reported in such detail before gorbachev 
came to power in march 1985 but media stories of incidents have 
become more common and specific especially since the chernobyl 
nuclear accident in april 1986

secretary of state george p shultz met 
today with president hafez assad of syria and said if the united 
states and the soviet union can improve relations the countries in 
the middle east should be able to do the same 
shultz told arab reporters in damascus that washington and moscow 
have both agreed to address ourselves to the middle east issues 
and said there would be more talks 
in a news conference shortly before meeting with assad shultz 
noted that the superpowers have resolved many of their own disputes 
if we can solve some of our problems why cant the people in 
the middle east area come to grips with their own he asked 
the summit pointed the united states and soviet union in a more 
cooperative direction in dealing with regional disputes and shultz 
hopes syria will take a cue from moscow 
syria which has been critical of the shultz mission is the 
soviet unions principal ally in the arab world and has the only 
missile arsenal that can approach israels in capability 
israeli officials say syria has put chemical warheads on some of 
its missiles and that they can reach israeli cities and military 
targets 
speaking to the arab journalists shultz repeated his contention 
that the palestinian state on the west benk and gaza strip demanded 
by arabs just doesnt make any sense 
he said a confederation or an attachment to another state or 
states was a more workable way of looking at it 
he suggested american states or swiss cantons as possible models 
for a future palestinian entity 
a day earlier shultz told israel that its occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip and frustration of palestinian civil rights 
were a deadend street 
shultz is reporting to assad that the us plan for middle east 
peace talks ran into a deadend in israel and jordan 
the secretary of state found neither king hussein of jordan nor 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir prepared to negotiate under 
terms set by washington 
the plight of american hostages and the syrian military 
deployment in lebanon were also on the agenda 
since there is virtually no us contact with iran the syrian 
government remains the main us channel for information from 
tehran syria is irans main arab ally 
while the us state department routinely affirms its support for 
lebanons indpendence syrian influence in the warbattered country 
is considered preferable to the rise of iraniansponsored islamic 
fundamentalists believed to hold us and other foreign hostages 
there 
shultz flew to damascus from cairo where he had spent the night 
after flying from jerusalem where he had talks with shamir 
he was met at damascus airport by syrian foreign minister farouk 
alsharaa before heading to the us embassy 
shultz on his fourth trip to the region this year to promote his 
peace plan held two meetings with shamir in jerusalem on sunday in 
an effort to persuade him to agree to make a commitment to jordan 
that israel will exchange part of the occupied territories for arab 
recogniton 
in a public statement shultz told israel the continued 
occupation of the west bank and gaza and the frustation of 
palestinian rights is a deadend street he added the belief 
that this can continue is an illusion 
he also spoke darkly of the prospect of another war in this 
region where longrange missiles and chemical weapons have 
proliferated 
king hussein in talks saturday with shultz in amman insisted on 
an israeli commitment to withdraw as a precondition for accepting 
the us proposal for peace talks 
jordan controlled the west bank from 1948 until 1967 
the occupied lands were virtually shut down on sunday for the 
third day of a strike called by leaders of the arab uprising to 
protest shultzs visit 
two israelis and more than 200 palestinians have died since 
december as a result of violence in the west bank and in the gaza 
strip which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
the shultz peace proposal calls for an international peace 
conference in which the united states the soviet union china 
britain and france as the five permanent members of the un 
security council would serve as hosts 
the negotiations would be aimed at selfrule for 15 million 
palestinian arabs in the west bank and gaza but not a separate 
state in a second stage israel and the arabs would try to find an 
overall settlement to their conflict

about 36000 palestinian high school students 
today returned to classes for the first time in four months and 
police accused five arabs of starting a fire that destroyed hundreds 
of acres in northern israel 
prime minister yitzhak shamir left today for the united states to 
meet soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in a bid to further 
improve relations between israel and the soviet union 
on sunday israels highest court upheld a deportation order 
against mubarak awad an arabamerican who advocates civil 
disobedience against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
he was given a week to leave 
the army has been opening grade schools and junior high schools 
in the occupied lands over the past two weeks citing a recent 
reduction in violence 
in the west bank city of hebron students burned tires and threw 
stones at soldiers outside the hussein school an arab reporter 
said he said the soldiers opened fire and one student was grazed by 
a bullet 
several students and teachers in ramallah also in the west bank 
said their return to school will not end demonstrations against 
israeli rule that have persisted for six months 
its good to be back in school because without being educated 
we cant be liberated said ranna bahu a 17yearold senior at 
friends girls school we can continue demonstrating after we take 
our classes 
police spokeswoman edna zigelshifer would not identify the five 
arabs arrested for setting a fire on sunday that destroyed several 
hundred acres of trees in northern israel she said only that they 
were young men from villages about 80 miles north of jerusalem 
david angel a spokesman for an agency that manages most of 
israels forest land said arabs were suspected of starting a series 
of brush and forest fires that have destroyed 17500 acres of woods 
and pastures in the last five weeks 
he said most of the fires appeared to be the work of palestinians 
acting in connection with the arab uprising 
angel said he based his claim on the location of most of the 
fires many of which had been in fields bordering the west bank 
last year only 8750 acres burned in israel between may and 
october while this years figure is already double he said 
in jerusalem the supreme court ruled that awad harms the 
security and public order and was illegally in israel because he 
did not have a valid residence permit his lawyers argued that he 
should be granted legal residence because he was born in jerusalem 
awads americanborn wife nancy nye has denied government 
charges her husband wrote leaflets encouraging the arab uprising 
his ideas for civil disobedience have been adopted by underground 
leaders of the uprising 
awad maintains a home in wapakoneta ohio 
shamir announced his scheduled meeting with shevardnadze at an 
airport news conference before flying to a special un session on 
disarmament in new york 
we have a lot to say to each other he said our 
discussions will focus on the attitude of the soviet union toward 
regional issues including israel and the middle east the lack of 
normal relations between us and the soviet union and the problem of 
soviet jews 
the scheduled meeting would be the latest in a series of talks 
between israeli and soviet officials since kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev came to power three years ago 
the soviet union severed diplomatic relations with the jewish 
state after the 1967 middle east war and has been a staunch 
supporter of syria israels most implacable foe 
a military spokesman said meanwhile that the army was 
experimenting with a new aluminum bullet to replace regular 
ammunition used to quell violent demonstrations 
the israeli newspaper haaretz said the new bullet is lighter than 
the steel bullet and is designed to travel slower and be less apt to 
penetrate skin when fired from a distance 
two israelis and 201 palestinians have died since dec 8 as a 
result of the uprisings in the lands israel seized in the 1967 
middle east war 
an israeli soldier was sentenced sunday to a year in prison for 
the fatal shooting of a palestinian in the gaza strip last october 
the soldier was identified as yaacov tamir an ethiopian immigrant

a boy who watched a 10foot alligator 
leap from a pond and kill his 4yearold playmate said it seemed 
like a dream until she disappeared underwater screaming 
game officers fired five shots to kill the bull alligator about 
five hours later after spotting the reptile on the bank of hidden 
lake with the limp 31pound body of erin lynn glover in its jaws 
erin who was nicknamed gizmo was splashing through 
ankledeep water along the residential lake with her 8yearold 
brother justin their labrador puppy and neighbor jason 
kershanick 9 on saturday evening when the gator leaped out and 
snapped up the girl in its teeth 
while she was kicking she must have kicked the alligator 
jason said sunday right when she stopped kicking the alligator 
jumped up out of the water and started biting her two times in the 
stomach then he dropped her and she crawled away and then he got 
out of the water more and grabbed her from the back and went in the 
water 
it was pretty quick jason said it seemed like a 
nightmare a dream but then the way she screamed when i saw the 
blood after he went in then i realized it was real 
alligators tend to pull their prey underwater drowning them and 
stashing the body for later feeding wildlife officials said 
shes just a precious looking girl shes going to be missed 
said charlotte kershanick jasons mother 
people will be a lot more cautious mrs kershanick added 
a lot of them are aggravated because theyve complained about the 
alligators being here but nobody does anything they ought to have 
the ponds fenced in 
richard latarski a 64yearold retiree said he telephoned the 
state game commission two years ago and asked them to get rid of the 
alligator that killed erin it had killed ducks and turtles in the 
neighborhood for at least five years he said 
the commission latarski said rejected his complaint and told 
him the alligator wasnt causing any menace to anyone 
commission spokesman lt jim farrior said sunday that he had no 
record of latarskis complaint 
erins death was the sixth fatality and the 46th unprovoked 
alligator attack in florida since 1948 farrior said 
alligators have been a protected species in florida since the 
mid1960s when their population dwindled after years of vigorous 
hunting but in recent years it has become clear that the species is 
in no danger of extinction farrior said 
state wildlife experts estimate there are 1 million alligators on 
67 million acres of land 
on sept 1 for the first time since 1962 the state will hold a 
onemonth gator hunt in which up to 3000 will be taken 
they occupy pretty much any body of water that would look like 
an alligator lives there and lots that dont farrior said 
the small manmade lake was a popular spot for children even 
though it was full of alligators residents said 
all the kids around here played around all these lakes said 
erins stepfather ty bowns outside the familys home i dont 
think anybody took the alligators all that seriously 
it was a shock it will be a while getting over it bowns 
said 
the area is about 25 miles south of sarasota on floridas west 
coast

the senate gave final approval today 
to a bill banning nuclear weapons and nuclearequipped warships from 
the country in a move aimed at us military bases in the 
philippines 
similar legislation is pending in the house of representatives 
nineteen senators gave their approval to the bill on the third 
and final reading three voted against the measure and one abstained 
the bill which received preliminary approval last month sets 
prison terms of up to 30 years for bringing nuclear weapons into the 
country and up to 12 years imprisonment for importing nuclear 
components 
supporters said the measure was aimed at the six american 
military installations in the philippines as part of its defense 
policy the united states refuses to confirm or deny whether it has 
deployed nuclear weapons in the philippines 
senate president jovito salonga a cosponsor hailed the measure 
as a contribution to world disarmament 
the philippines should not be a promoter of the deadly arms 
race salonga said we should never be part of the problem we 
should be part of the solution 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile a former defense minister 
said he supported the bill because the presence of nuclear weapons 
in our territory is inconsistent with the national interest 
enrile criticized president corazon aquino for allegedly failing 
to enforce a provision in the new constitution which states that the 
country opposes nuclear weapons consistent with the national 
interest 
legal experts are divided over whether the phrase consistent 
with the national interest makes the provision less than an 
unequivocal nuclear weapons ban 
the three senators who opposed the bill john osmena neptali 
gonzalez and mamintal tamano said the measure would raise problems 
with the united states over the future of the bases 
the current bases agreement expires in 1991 and the constitution 
requires that any extension be provided for by a bilateral treaty 
subject to approval by twothirds of the senate 
last april the us and philippine governments began a review of 
the current agreement a successful outcome is expected to influence 
manilas decision on whether to allow the bases to remain after 1991 
mrs aquino says she will honor the agreement but refuses to say 
whether she will support an extension 
meanwhile defense secretary fidel ramos told a house committee 
today that the antinuclear bill was not completely satisfactory 
to me 
ramos called for unspecified amendments to give mrs aquino 
greater flexibility on the issue and in her dealings with the united 
states 
us officials have said the measure would severely limit 
american military operations particularly those of the navy at its 
base at subic bay 
warships which are believed armed with nuclear weapons routinely 
call at subic bay many are en route to the persian gulf to protect 
commercial shipping from attacks related to the iraniraq war 
the senate bill bans the storage or transit of all nuclear 
weapons as well as nuclearequipped ships and aircraft the original 
measure also banned port calls by nuclearpowered ships 
however the bill was amended to allow nuclearpowered commercial 
and research vessels to call at philippine ports

church leaders from around the world 
marched to the pealing of bells today into this 14th century russian 
orthodox monastery for the opening session of a threeday conference 
marking the churchs 1000 anniversary 
hundreds of soviets watched the 45minute procession of church 
officials from under the shade of maple trees and ancient churches 
on the grounds of the trinityst sergius monastery 
guests included archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
representatives of pope john paul ii and officials of dozens of 
other eastern and western faiths 
we have a longstanding relationship runcie told reporters 
before entering the conference hall we have not lost contact 
through the centuries on the 900th anniversary we were the only 
western church to send a message 
the celebration of the russian orthodox churchs 1000 
anniversary being commemorated in moscow before moving to kiev 
leningrad and vladimir east of moscow drew about 500 
representatives from more than 100 countries 
the conference of church leaders will canonize nine new saints 
including russias most famous icon painter andrei rublev and 14th 
century nobleman dmitri donskoy who helped defeat the tatars 
dominating russia 
according to church documents the conference also was to 
consider an administrative charter for the church and discuss its 
activities on behalf of world peace 
the zagorsk monastery was founded in 1345 by holy sergei of 
radonezh and still contains a monastery as well as one of the 
countrys main seminaries 
christianity was introduced to russia by prince vladimir in 
kievan rus the ancient name of what is now the northern soviet 
republic of the ukraine with a baptism ceremony on the banks of 
the dnieper river in 988 
church officials began the celebration sunday in moscow with a 
service in epiphany cathedral led by 77yearold russian orthodox 
patriarch pimen and a wreathlaying ceremony at the tomb of the 
unknown soldier next to the kremlin 
soviet television showed pimen and other orthodox clergymen 
officiating at the ceremony as the strains of a male choir filled 
the opulently furbished church which has five domes and three 
altars and dates from 1731 
pope john paul ii did not attend the ceremonies although he has 
often expressed the desire to visit the soviet union but the 
vatican said earlier that the russian orthodox church did not extend 
an invitation to the pope russian orthodox churchmen have said john 
paul was invited 
the pontiff has said he would go to the soviet union only on 
condition that he be allowed to visit the heavilycatholic soviet 
republics but john paul has said he has been twice denied 
permission to visit lithuania one of the countrys catholic 
heartlands 
in a rare show of cooperation between church and state the state 
ministry of religion participated in organizing events linked to the 
millennium 
the government gave pimen and 14 other church officials awards 
friday in honor of the millennium and on saturday state and church 
officials announced jointly that cathedrals in the oldest monastery 
the pechersky monastery in kiev would be returned to the church 
pimen met this spring with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in 
the first such meeting since 1943 and pledged his support for the 
soviet leaders reform policies religious dissidents say such 
cooperation is a sign of the churchs subservience to the state 
which officially is athesitic 
dissidents planned their own services and seminars to give what 
they said is a true picture of the situation of religious believers 
a law that went into effect in 1929 the height of the stalinera 
repression against the church prohibits believers from organizing 
charitable work restricts religious education and requires 
government registration of worshipers 
government officials now say that law is outdated and will be 
replaced by a new statute guaranteeing freedom of conscience but 
the law has not been published and neither church nor government 
officials have revealed its contents

hundreds oconnor said sunday of a letter he received announcing 
castros decision it was a direct followup to my talks with 
president castro 
the cardinal who left sunday night on a trip to the soviet 
union had no timetable for the release the state department 
confirmed that it had the list but none of the names was released 
amnesty international the worldwide human rights group 
estimated in its 1987 annual report that 450 political prisoners 
were being held in cuba 
the new york times which reported the story in sundays paper 
said 385 of the 429 political prisoners remaining in cuban jails 
would be released 
oconnor discussed the possible release of the group during a 
fourhour meeting with castro in april when the cardinal the 
first bishop to visit cuba in two decades made personal appeals 
for several prisoners 
i hope it is motivated by humanitarian purposes but even if it 
is not it would have the political intention of sending some 
signals that things are changing in cuba oconnor told an 
impromptu news conference after saying mass in st patricks 
cathedral 
oconnor added that he had received almost a commitment that no 
hardened criminals would be sent to the united states a 
concern stemming from the 1980 boat lift that brought hundreds of 
freed cuban criminals into the united states 
last thursday oconnor said he met with cuban vice president dr 
carlos rafael rodriguez to discuss the list of prisoners list and 
two other topics sending aids specialists to cuba and possibly 
shipping some medicine to the country 
the 44 prisoners who would not be released had been jailed since 
shortly after castro assumed power in 1959 the times reported the 
cuban leader said the 44 were convicted of grave and dangerous 
violations 
despite his optimism over the prisoner release and the medical 
programs oconnor expressed concern that castro could undo the 
progress by attacking the united states in one of his speeches 
i hope he doesnt come out with any foolish tirades against the 
united states because many of us are working to renew the 
relationship between our two countries he said

the united rubber workers union has ratified a 
threeyear contract with firestone inc that could add as much as 4 
an hour to workers salaries and benefits a union spokesman said 
union leaders and the company agreed last month on contract terms 
to end a weeklong strike that began may 15 balloting by local 
members completed sunday night assured ratification said union 
spokesman curt brown 
ninetyfive percent of the members of local 7 in akron and 90 
percent of the members of local 138 in noblesville ind voted 
sunday in favor of the contract brown said the locals were the 
last to vote on the pact and the results assured the contracts 
ratification he said 
in other balloting over the past 10 days workers at des moines 
iowa decatur ill and russellville ark approved the pact the 
only rejection vote came from workers in oklahoma city 
a urw contract must win approval both by a majority of the locals 
and by a majority of the members it covers brown said the 
firestone contract covers 4700 members he said 
i feel the agreement will afford protection for these members 
during the next three years and does offer the possibility of a wage 
reopener in the third year said milan mike stone urw 
international president in a statement after the akron and 
noblesville votes 
brown said the contracts strengths include good health and 
retirement benefits and protection against inflation 
an average firestone worker at the six plants earns 1250 an 
hour according to the union the proposed contract with firestone 
would provide a 25centanhour increase but it would be considered 
an advance to be deducted from future costofliving raises in 
increments of no more than 10 cents a year the costofliving 
allowances were retroactive to may 23 brown said 
he said increases in both salary and benefits over the life of 
the contract could amount to as much as 4 an hour 
right now our average is just a little below what is the 
average for the industry and this should help that brown said 
firestone workers average earnings were lower he said because 
of concessions made by workers at the oklahoma city and des moines 
plants

friend of mine in detroit a genuine certified gangster we 
sat down and figured it out westhead lived in palos verdes and we 
got his street address we would sabotage his car mess with his 
brake lining 
but the mother of the former olympic basketball star persuaded 
him not to go through with the plot against westhead then coach of 
the los angeles lakers 
during the finals against the philadelphia 76ers haywood passed 
out at a practice after a night of smoking cocaine that was 
followed by an argument with teammates jim chones and brad holland

the owners of a coal mine where an 
explosion killed dozens of miners have acknowledged that radio 
contact was made with missing miners hours after the blast but 
broken off to search for more miners 
family members of some of the dead miners and a newspaper alleged 
that rescue workers had bungled the search operation 
meanwhile diggers today found one more body bringing the total 
of confirmed dead to 46 an initial police report said two bodies 
were discovered today but mine officials said one was the correct 
number 
search teams continued to hunt for the last five missing workers 
but officials said there was little hope they would be found alive 
for more than two days after the blast which trapped 57 miners 
rescue authorities insisted there were no signs of life inside the 
mine but six miners were found alive in an air pocket on saturday 
and one of them said the six had made radio contact with rescuers a 
few hours after the explosion 
owners of the mine in borken acknowledged that a radio operator 
had contacted a group of missing miners but that officials believed 
at the time that the operator may have been seaking with a rescue 
team 
news of the radio contact sparked intense criticism in the news 
media of how the rescue operation has been run 
it is a scandal that already on wednesday radio contact had 
been made with those who were finally rescued but that this 
wasnt taken seriously the saarbreucker zeitung newspaper said in 
an editorial 
some miners families contended rescue workers should have been 
more concerned with searching for survivors than bringing up bodies 
the six were discovered early saturday after their sounds were 
picked up by a television crews microphone lowered into a shaft 500 
feet beneath the earth 
on sunday several hundred residents turned out for religious 
services to remember the victims 
at a news conference afterwards hermann kraemer board president 
of preussen elektra the company that owns the mine said radio 
contact was lost wednesday after a radio operator told the men to 
stop transmitting 
kraemer said the operator told the men to break contact because 
he wanted to try and reach other possible survivors 
kraemer said that after the contact with the miners was lost 
radio operators tried unsuccessfully for 10 hours to reestablish 
communication with them 
the failure to regain contact led us to wonder whether there 
had been an actual contact with the miners or with a search team 
kraemer said 
but he said feverish efforts were already being made to locate 
survivors in the area of the mine where the miners were eventually 
found

extremeright leader jeanmarie le pen said today he 
wanted to work with the centerright parties to defeat the 
socialists in next weeks national assembly runoff election 
a coalition of conservatives showed surprising strength in 
firstround voting for the national assembly but computer 
projections said the socialists are still likely to win a majority 
in the 577member legislature 
the socialist party and the outgoing centerright majority 
coalition were running almost even in sundays popular vote leaving 
president francois mitterrands party with a narrow advantage 
heading into sundays runoff 
mitterrand won reelection last month soundly beating 
centerright candidate jacques chirac 
the extremeright national front of jeanmarie le pen despite 
getting about 10 percent of the vote seemed unlikely to win any 
seats in parliament 
le pen said he wanted to reach a mutual assistance pact with the 
traditional right parties something the conservative leaders have 
said they would not do 
if they withdraw their candidates everywhere that were ahead 
which is normal we would do the same for their candidates le pen 
said on french television 
interior minister pierre joxe said it was reasonable to think 
that socialist premier michel rocards government may be able to 
count on a parliamentary majority 
but conservative leaders were heartened by a showing much better 
than had been predicted in preelection polls and called on their 
forces to campaign hard in the final week 
today anything is possible said alain juppe former budget 
minister in chiracs government 
the turnout rate of 657 percent was the lowest in a legislative 
election in france since world war ii and well below the 785 
percent of the 1986 legislative election 
with 99 percent of the vote counted the socialists had 376 
percent compared with 377 percent for the conservative coalition 
113 percent for the communists and 97 percent for the national 
front 
any candidate who received more than 50 percent of the vote 
sunday was elected in districts where none received 50 percent all 
candidates with at least 125 percent had the right to compete in 
sundays runoff but there was heavy pressure on candidates with no 
chance of winning to withdraw 
computer projections by polling firms working for french 
television networks said the socialists should emerge with 290 to 
330 seats in the national assembly at least 289 are needed for a 
majority 
with results in for 565 of 577 districts socialists and their 
close allies were elected outright in 39 seats and leading in 185 
others the conservative rally for the republic and the centerright 
union for french democracy which ran a joint slate won 75 seats 
and were leading in 137 
the communists won one seat and were favored to win 22 more 
the national front was projected to win none largely because the 
voting system was changed by chiracs government from a proportional 
system to a winnertakeall system in each district which favors 
larger parties at the expense of smaller ones 
the remaining seats were either too close to call or going to 
minor parties 
from 1986 until last months presidential election chirac and 
mitterrand shared power in an often contentious system the french 
called cohabitation 
during his reelection campaign mitterrand said he wanted a new 
socialistled government to work with the rightistdominated 
national assembly in a break from the polarized tradition of french 
politics 
but four days after mitterrand beat chirac with 54 percent of the 
vote the rocard government was appointed loaded with hardline 
socialists 
two days later mitterrand called legislative elections saying 
the government needed a solid majority before it could bring about a 
promised opening to the political center 
the legislative campaign coming when the public seemed exhausted 
by the presidential election aroused little interest few issues 
were debated 
the socialists said they would reestablish a wealth tax 
abolished by the right in 1986 and use the money to pay a 
guaranteed income to the poor 
rightists argued during the campaign that a socialist majority 
would go back to unpopular radical programs the socialists enacted 
after being elected in 1981 but largely abandoned over the next 
five years

about 100 prisoners who were told to remove pinups 
from newly painted walls rioted and burned down much of a 
minimumsecurity prison on the northwest england coast officials 
said today 
the home office which runs the police and prisons said 11 
prisoners who escaped during sunday nights rioting at haverigg 
prison near millon 281 miles from london were still on the run 
five others were captured 
no guards were injured but one prisoner was hospitalized with a 
suspected broken jaw and 10 were given first aid for minor injuries 
the home office said 
the search for the escaped prisoners involving about 100 police 
officers was being hampered because prison records were destroyed 
in the rioting cumbria police said 
the home office said no demands were issued by the prisoners 
scores of police with dogs joined prison guards to encircle the 
facility firefighters waited for several hours before going in 
because of the possibility of attack at about 9 am police said 
everything was under control although there was a great deal of 
damage 
nearly every part of the institution has been burned down 
said david evans general secretary of the prison officers 
association in an interview on british broadcasting corp radio 
he said the prisons kitchen clothing exchange stores education 
departments and several of its wings had been gutted by the blaze 
evans said his association had been warning the prison system for 
months that there are insufficient staff throughout the penal 
system and noted that fewer than 20 prison officers were on duty 
at the time of the riot 
evans said the riot proved that inmates needed hardly any excuse 
to cause trouble if it is over the pinups it merely confirms 
our view that you dont need an excuse if you are a prisoner to burn 
down an institution 
the jail with 490 inmates is a former royal air force camp used 
for prisoners either nearing release or considered not dangerous by 
parole boards the 390 prisoners who gave themselves up were 
sheltered in a workshop police said

rep mike andrews dtexas introduced a bill 
today to raise the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack and use part of 
the revenue for an antismoking campaign aimed at teenagers 
ninety percent of the 218 billion the bill would be expected to 
raise over the next five years would be earmarked for reducing the 
federal budget deficit andrews told a news conference that would 
leave about 440 million a year for antismoking advertising and 
education half of which would target minority communities where 
the percentage of smokers is higher than usual 
the legislation which andrews says has little chance of passing 
this year is supported by 20 medical and socialwelfare 
organizations 
ninety percent of all smokers start by age 19 and 60 percent 
begin by age 14 andrews said a 25cent excise tax increase 
will stop more than 1 million teenagers from smoking each year 
medical experts estimate that almost 1000 americans die each day 
of smokingrelated diseases 
the federal tax on cigarettes is 16 cents a pack

the supreme court expanding its study of drug 
testing in the workplace today agreed to decide whether the 
nations railroads may require all employees involved in serious 
accidents to take such tests 
the court will review a ruling that struck down as an 
unconstitutional invasion of privacy federal regulations requiring 
such drug tests for railroad employees 
the justices last february said they would decide whether the 
us customs service may conduct drug tests for those seeking 
drugenforcement jobs a federal appeals court upheld such testing 
today the justices said they will study the customs service and 
railroad employees cases together a decision is expected sometime 
in 1989 
the railroad drugtesting case stems from regulations issued by 
the federal railroad administration in 1985 to alleviate a 
significant safety problem caused by alcohol and drug use by rail 
employees 
the regulations generally require railroads to conduct blood and 
urine tests on employees directly involved in serious train 
accidents 
the regulations also authorize but do not require railroads to 
administer breath and urine tests after certain accidents incidents 
or rule violations 
the san franciscobased 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled 
last feb 11 that such tests conducted by private employers acting 
for the government are unreasonable searches banned by the 
constitutions fourth amendment 
the appeals court noted that the regulations require the testing 
of all members of a trains crew following certain accidents even 
in the absence of any particularized suspicion of drug or 
alcohol use 
accidents incidents or rule violations by themselves do not 
create reasonable grounds for suspecting that tests will demonstrate 
alcohol or drug impairment in any one railroad employee much less 
an entire train crew the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today reagan administration lawyers 
argued that the 9th circuit court was overstating the nature of 
employee privacy interests and understating the competing safety 
interests at stake 
in urging the justices to reinstate the federal drugtesting 
regulations the government lawyers said railroad accidents linked 
to drug or alcohol use killed 42 people injured 61 and caused 
property damages estimated at 19 million from 1972 through 1983 
the governments appeal said the railroad case raised issues that 
should be studied together with those presented in the customs 
service case 
the case is burnley vs railway labor executives association

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the drugpossession conviction of a man who was carrying 
1000 grams of cocaine when stopped by authorities at a honolulu 
airport 
the court said it will review a ruling that drug enforcement 
agents lacked adequate evidence to suspect the man was engaged in a 
crime when they stopped him 
the reagan administration said the appeals court ruling in andrew 
sokolows case is a major impediment in the fight against illegal 
drug dealing 
many of the factors present in this case are ones on which 
narcotics agents routinely rely when intercepting drug couriers 
justice department lawyers told the high court 
sokolow was stopped by drug enforcement administration agents 
july 25 1984 as he returned to honolulu from a trip to miami 
authorities said he aroused their suspicions three days earlier 
when he and a female companion departed for miami 
they said sokolow who appeared to be in his mid20s bought his 
plane tickets with 2100 in cash taken from a roll of money that 
appeared to contain more than 4000 he was wearing a black 
jumpsuit and a great deal of gold jewelry appeared nervous and he 
and the woman carried four handbags on the plane without checking 
any luggage 
agents also suspected sokolow was using an alias because the name 
he gave the ticket agent was not the same as the name listed for the 
telephone number he gave the agent 
sokolows behavior dress and demeanor fit the profile of a drug 
courier narcotics agents said 
sokolow pled gulty to possession of cocaine with intent to 
distribute and was sentenced to five years in prison he appealed 
the conviction on grounds the cocaine should not have been used as 
evidence against him he said the drug agents violated his right 
against unlawful search and seizure when they stopped him 
the 9th us circuit court of appeal threw out the conviction 
saying an officers suspicion must be supported by evidence of 
ongoing criminal activity 
such behavior cannot be intuited from a hodgepodge assembly of 
factors about individual character rather than criminal acts the 
appeals court said 
the appeals court discounted the importance of sokolows 
nervousness stating nervousness would appear to be a normal 
human reaction to air travel today with a seemingly growing risk of 
midair collision and the near certainty of delays that interrupt 
the plans of travelers 
the supreme court in a series of somewhat confusing rulings has 
upheld the use of socalled drug courier profiles by police 
but the 9th circuit court said while the vague and inchoate 
profile presented here may generate good police work absent 
more it certaintly would generate bad law 
the case is us vs sokolow 871295

the supreme court today killed a bid by sen 
john melcher dmont to give the senate a bigger hand in naming 
members to a key federal committee that helps set monetary policy 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that dismissed a 
challenge to the way some members are appointed to the federal open 
market committee 
the committee part of the federal reserve system directs the 
buying and selling of government securities in the open market by 
federal reserve banks 
the committees 12 members consist of the seven governors of the 
federal reserve board and five representatives of federal reserve 
banks 
the federal reserve board governors are appointed by the 
president with senate approval the five others are selected 
annually by the boards of directors of the reserve banks from among 
the banks presidents and first vice presidents 
melcher filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of how 
the the five bank executives are named to the committee he said 
they also should be subject to senate confirmation 
the us court of appeals threw out the suit last december the 
court said ruling on the merits of melchers claim would represent 
undue judicial interference with the legislative process 
any change in the appointment of committee members must be left 
to congress the appeals court said adding that similar challenges 
by other other senators met with a similar fate 
melcher said the changing national and world economy has given 
the issue a greater urgency than ever as the federal reserve 
grows in importance so does the injury to this plaintiff in the 
deprivation of his rightful constitutional role in the selection of 
the officers who control it he said 
the case is melcher vs federal open market committee 871546

three consecutive days of talks have failed to 
end the 13weekold scriptwriters strike against movie and 
television producers but another meeting was scheduled for today 
neither side claimed progress 
its just real sensitive cheryl rhoden spokeswoman for the 
writers guild of america said before the two sides recessed sunday 
evening 
negotiators also met friday and saturday and were scheduled to 
resume talks this afternoon 
ms rhoden declined to comment on the issues discussed between 
the guild and the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers and said only that negotiations were proceeding 
on friday the guild sent letters to owners and managers of 198 
abctv affiliates nationwide urging them to press abc to give 
ground in negotiations to prevent further delays in the start of the 
fall tv season 
the writers walked out march 7 in a dispute that centers on 
payments or residuals and reruns of onehour television shows 
demand for onehour shows in rerun or syndication is declining

the supreme court today let stand the rape 
conviction of an illinois man who wanted a judge to examine in 
private the conversations his victim had with rape crisis counselors 
the court over two dissenting votes refused to hear arguments 
that an illinois law granting absolute confidentiality to statements 
made during rape crisis counseling violate a rape defendants rights 
the illinois supreme court upheld the law as well as leslie 
foggys conviction for raping a rock island woman three years ago 
foggy was convicted of abducting and raping a 26yearold woman 
in blackhawk state park on july 18 1985 
he contended that he and the woman had consensual sex and that 
she charged rape only after he refused to pay her 20 
during his prosecution foggys lawyer sought the release of 
those comments made by the alleged victim or rape crisis counselors 
that dealt with how to cope with the possible trauma of testifying 
at trial 
illinois law previously had allowed judges to inspect such 
documents privately in certain cases but in 1985 the law was 
changed to impose absolute confidentiality 
in challenging that confidentiality foggy relied heavily on a 
1987 supreme court ruling in a pennsylvania rape case 
in that decision the justices said state officials could not be 
forced to surrender confidential welfare records to people accused 
of child abuse but the court said such records could be examined 
privately by a trial judge to determine whether they contain 
information that might help exonerate a defendant 
however the pennsylvania law under which the documents in that 
case had been made confidential did not impose absolute 
confidentiality as does the illinois law 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall voted to hear 
foggys appeal but four votes are needed to grant review 
the case is foggy vs illinois 876763

teenagers often are better at adjusting to life 
than their parents believe says a doctor who led a study of 6000 
middleclass high school students in the united states and nine 
other countries 
dr daniel offer director of the center for the study of 
adolescents at chicagos michael reese hospital said in an 
interview that hes optimistic about who will inherit the earth 
i dont think were leaving the world in the hands of groups 
that are going to go off the deep end and they might even do a 
better job of it offer said sunday 
the results of his research conducted mostly in 1984 and 1985 
are the subject of a new book the teenage world published by 
plenum medical books of new york 
the teens surveyed were from australia bangladesh hungary 
israel italy japan taiwan turkey west germany and the united 
states 
offer conceded the results might be skewed because they covered 
only middleclass teenagers and one psychiatrist cautioned that 
psychological profiles based on the survey may be superficial 
for the study between 500 and 1000 teenagers in each country 
completed a psychological selfimage questionnaire of 130 items 
translated into their own languages 
at least 100 boys and 100 girls in the 1315 and 1619 age groups 
were surveyed by local researchers in each country offer said 
the survey found that at least 73 percent of the youths in the 10 
countries have a healthy image of themselves it found them to be 
generally selfconfident optimistic about their career goals with 
realistic social concerns 
and more than 90 percent of the teenagers in each country said 
they felt good about their parents and their values 
only 12 percent felt they would not be able to take care of 
themselves in the future offer said that contrasts with the image 
of teenagers as floundering impulseridden and oriented only to 
immediate gratification 
what impressed us is that the majority of teenagers are 
optimistic about their future and their main concern is economic 
getting a job that pays a good living offer said 
there are differences but there is the concept of a global 
village and kids are becoming more alike 
he said the survey found similar differences between the sexes in 
each country for example he said girls had a higher degree of 
social awareness and commitment to others while boys coped better 
with solving problems and showed more control of their emotions 
the survey also turned up some distinct national characteristics 
israeli and american teens for example were the most confident 
while taiwanese were most likely to be confused 
american teens tended to have more difficulties with 
relationships among families and friends than teens in other 
countries offer said 
dr richard c marohn professor of clinical psychiatry at 
northwestern university said offers research is important but 
added it doesnt answer all the questions we have about 
teenagers

the supreme court refused 63 today to order 
states to give refunds to businesses when a state tax is invalidated 
as a violation of interstate commerce 
the justices turned down an appeal asking them to apply 
retroactively a 1987 ruling in which the high court struck down a 
washington state manufacturing tax that favored some instate 
businesses 
justices byron r white john paul stevens and antonin scalia 
voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed for 
review 
the court ruled last year that the washington tax discriminated 
unlawfully against interstate commerce because the levy in effect 
was assessed only on products manufactured in washington and sold to 
outofstate customers 
two dissenting justices said then that the decision could 
revolutionize the law of state taxation by drastically limiting 
the states discretion to structure their tax systems 
the court sent the case back to the washington supreme court to 
determine whether the ruling should be applied retroactively 
thereby forcing the state to refund taxes to businesses that paid 
the revenue 
the state court ruled last january that the businesses are not 
entitled to refunds 
state officials estimated that refunds from 1980 through 1984 
could exceed 423 million if the state were forced to pay them 
the tax challenged by 70 businesses was imposed on gross 
receipts of all manufacturing within the state 
manufacturers selling their products outside the state were 
required to pay the tax but those selling products only within 
washingtons borders were exempt if they paid another gross receipts 
tax on wholesale or retail sales 
by paying either the wholesaling or retailing tax a wholly 
instate business thus gained an exemption from the state 
manufacturing tax at the same time companies doing interstate 
business received no such exemption when paying business taxes in 
other states 
companies that challenged the tax said that not forcing states to 
repay unlawful taxes would neutralize the effect of last years 
ruling and discourage businesses from challenging other unfair taxes 
the council of state chambers of commerce in support of the 
companies appeal said that in recent years state after state 
has been taking a back door prospectiveonly approach to adverse 
largedollar state tax test cases 
even if businesses win in court they end up losing because they 
do not receive any refunds the organization said 
the cases are national can corp vs washington 871629 and 
tyler pipe industries vs washington 871767

the hearing to determine whether five instructors and their 
commanding officer should be courtmartialed for the march 2 death 
of airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis at pensacola 
naval air station 
in testimony saturday an instructor said safety procedures were 
informal at the navy rescue swimmer school

bennie t giles an instructor who was present but not charged 
none of the instructors were designated to observe but they took 
turns doing so during drills giles said

if they were in trouble during practice rescue drills in which 
instructors playing the role of panicked drowning victims grabbed 
them in head holds 
another instructor not charged petty officer 2nd class bobby 
powell said it was policy to take a student to the deep end for 
more training if he held on to the side of the pool 
thats what happened to mirecki witnesses testified but he 
later climbed out he said he wanted to quit the school and grabbed 
an equipment rack other students said

the st marys river channel on the 
floridageorgia border was blocked and closed to shipping today 
after a dredging boat sank leaking diesel fuel that endangered 
nearby tidal marshes 
the closed channel blocked both commercial traffic from the port 
of fernandina and military traffic from kings bay naval submarine 
base coast guard cmdr henry rohrs said in jacksonville sunday 
the 168foot crest which had been working to deepen the channel 
to accommodate the navys nuclear trident subs foundered and sank 
in high winds and heavy seas saturday morning 
most of the leaking diesel oil floated into the atlantic ocean 
but some drifted inside the channel where containment booms were 
erected to protect upriver creeks 
officials hoped the containment booms would keep the tidal 
marshes of cumberland island part of the federal park system from 
being polluted 
no oil had hit the marshes rohrs said 
seven crew members from the great lakes dredging and dock co 
dredging boat were plucked from the water as it sank in the 50foot 
deep channel a barge alongside broke away and drifted several miles 
south along fernandina beach before it was secured 
coast guard capt robert opezio onscene coordinator said the 
sunken dredge contained 40000 gallons of diesel fuel or enough to 
leak for three days at a rate of 500 gallons an hour 
the dredging company he said will have to pay for cleaning up 
the spill bill moore the companys project superintendent said he 
did not know what it would cost

the supreme court today gave a boost to groups 
seeking to place referenda before state voters 
the justices ruled unanimously that states permitting such 
socalled initiatives may not prohibit groups from paying those who 
gather petition signatures necessary to get an issue on the ballot 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said a colorado 
law that makes it a felony to pay those who circulate petitions is 
unconstitutional 
colorados prohibition of paid petition circulators restricts 
access to the most effective fundamental and perhaps economical 
avenue of political discourse he said 
many states permit citizens to place propositions on the ballot 
through the initiative process it has been particularly popular in 
the west as a means of encouraging direct democracy 
stevens said the colorado ban violates free speech rights of 
referenda supporters because it limits the number of voices who 
will convey the supporters message and the hours they can speak 
and therefore limits the size of the audience they can reach 
also stevens said requiring those who solicit signatures to be 
volunteers improperly reduces the chances the initiative will be 
placed before the voters limiting the groups ability to make 
the matter the focus of statewide discussion 
the court upheld an appeals court decision which struck down the 
colorado law 
the ban was challenged by coloradans for free enterprise a group 
seeking to deregulate the trucking industry the group said 
regulation of the industry by the state public utility commission 
had created an unfair monopoly that excluded competition 
the group sought in 1984 to place the deregulation initiative on 
the state ballot by accumulating 46737 signatures of registered 
voters on petitions or 5 percent of the states qualified voters 
the effort fell short as the state enforced its ban on paying 
people to round up the required signatures 
the ban was upheld by a federal judge but overturned by the 10th 
us circuit court of appeals 
state officials said paying signature solicitors violates 
grassroots petition drives by encouraging big spending and 
highpressure tactics by special interest groups 
they also said that paying people to gather signatures encourages 
fraud 
stevens said today there is no evidence to support the officials 
claims and added that there are adequate safeguards to prevent fraud 
the case is meyer vs grant 87920

the judge in the irancontra case today 
rejected a defense request for topsecret government documents but 
again questioned whether oliver l north and three codefendants 
could get a fair trial on conspiracy charges 
us district judge gerhard a gesell handed independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh a significant pretrial victory by rejecting the 
defenses wideranging request for ocuments relating to such 
operations as us intelligence gathering in iran and efforts to 
free american hostages in lebanon 
but the judge again expressed reservations about whether the 
defendants could get a fair trial on charges they conspired to 
defraud the government by diverting profits from the usiran arms 
sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
the prosecutions conspiracy case relates to a wide course of 
conduct that has to explain why each individual was involved what 
got him into it what he was doing before gesell said 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel who was fired from the 
national security council staff former national security adviser 
john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord are charged together in three 
counts of the 23count indictment returned in march 
the judge questioned whether the restrictions on the use of 
classified documents in a public trial would unfairly inhibit the 
defendants ability to present evidence that they were merely acting 
in accordance with procedures established for other covert 
operations known to their superiors in the government 
when a man is accused of a crime he ought to be able to get on 
the stand and tell his side of the story if he wants to gesell 
said 
but that right could be restricted if the defendants want to say 
id been doing these things time and time again in other covert 
operations with the approval of cabinet officials 
i really expect that if the defendants take the stand they 
are going to spill all over with classified information gesell 
said adding that he had no stomach for censoring the 
defendants testimony 
testimony about other covert operations the defendants may have 
participated in could be prohibited under the classified information 
procedures act by the governments unwillingness to expose the 
information in court gesell said 
such testimony would be important to the defense because it deals 
with that abstract question that the jury must decide what was 
on the mans mind when he participated in the irancontra affair 
gesell said 
what causes the problem here is the conspiracy counts the 
judge said repeating a reservation he voiced may 26 during a 
hearing on the legal problems posed by limited immunity that north 
poindexter and hakim received from congress for their testimony last 
year before the irancontra hearings on capitol hill 
the judge suggested that the prosecution try other counts which 
include charges that north and poindexter made false statements and 
obstructed congressional inquiries into covert aid the 
administration gave to the nicaraguan rebels 
but walsh argued that the conspiracy counts are really vital as 
a unifying function in the indictment the evidence in those counts 
is going to be really straightforward 
gesells denial of the pretrial discovery request came two days 
after the cia said in court papers that few people other than 
president reagan are cleared to review the highly sensitive material 
sought by the defense 
the cia estimated that the defense request would require the 
review of literally millions of pages of highly classified 
documents 
the 87page request included attempts by the defense to obtain 
classified usisraeli communications when israel shipped missiles 
to iran in 1985 to start the armsforhostage deals

the supreme court today expanded safeguards for 
workers who claim they were mistreated by employers 
the court ruled unanimously in a case from illinois that states 
may give protection to workers beyond that provided by federal labor 
law so long as it doesnt force courts to interpret collective 
bargaining agreements 
justice john paul stevens in his opinion for the court said 
federal law does not preclude such state lawsuits as long as the 
statelaw claim can be resolved without interpreting the collective 
bargaining agreement itself 
the court reinstated a suit by jonna lingle who was fired from 
her herrin ill job for filing what her employer said was a false 
claim for disability compensation 
ms lingle informed the norge division of magic chef in late 1984 
that she had sustained an injury while working at its plant she 
asked that norge pay her medical bills as provided for under the 
states workers compensation law 
norge fired her a week later asserting that she had filed a 
false claim 
ms lingle was represented by a union whose contract with norge 
protected workers against firings without just cause 
the day she was fired ms lingles union filed a grievance 
against norge an arbitrator ruled that her firing had been contrary 
to the contracts just cause provision and ms lingle was 
reinstated as a norge employee 
ms lingle also had sued norge pending the outcome of the 
grievance claim she said her firing violated illinois law 
the relief available to her under that state law is greater than 
the remedy she received in arbitration 
for example ms lingle could be awarded punitive damages against 
norge and could be compensated for lost overtime payments under the 
state law 
such awards were not available in the arbitration proeedings 
also ms lingle said she is entitled to additional relief under 
the state law because the job to which she was reinstated was not as 
desirable as the one she held before she was fired 
a federal trial judge threw out ms lingles lawsuit on grounds 
the state law is preempted by the federal labor management 
relations act of 1947 the 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld 
the judges ruling 
but stevens said today that a judge could decide under illinois 
law that ms lingle was fired illegally in retaliation for filing 
the workers compensation claim without deciding whether norge had 
violated the union contract 
the case is lingle vs norge 87259

thirtysix illegal immigrants were saved 
from the blistering heat of the desert and returned to the mexican 
border to find their way home but some of them said the parting 
might not be permanent 
most members of the group were in generally good condition when 
found saturday afternoon despite having gone without food and water 
for nearly a day in 108degree heat 
they were fortunate about 70 bodies have been found in the same 
general area of the southern arizona desert since 1980 according to 
figures released last summer by the us border patrol 
on sunday authorities loaded the latest group onto a bus and 
drove them to the border city of nogales 
thirtyone walked silently through a revolving steel gate into 
the mexican state of sonora the other five followed after 
videotaping interviews 
we have to think it over said gilberto perez 28 of the 
possibility he would try again to reach the agricultural belt 
surrounding phoenix 
authorities said all 36 including one woman came from the state 
of oaxaca 1500 miles to the south 
enrique gonzalez 50 said a field hand in oaxaca usually earns 
about 7000 pesos or 3 a day 
in my land what we earn is nothing he said 
what is that 7000 pesos when i have eight children 
gonzalez asked we eat only tortillas and beans 
others said the group started off with flour tortillas white 
bread canned beans and water but ran out on friday the third day 
of a trek northward 
late saturday morning they found water in a brackish pond 
tainted by tailings from the silverbell copper mine about 35 miles 
northwest of tucson 
a few hours later they were in custody because two men left the 
group to ask for help at a ranch near silverbell 
three members of the group received intravenous fluids for 
dehydration at northwest hospital in tucson a nurse said 
were glad nobody died thats why you get this kind of 
response with this soaring heat we responded with everything we 
had in an attempt to save lives said ronald dowdy chief patrol 
agent for the border patrols tucson sector 
the group crossed the usmexico border apparently by jumping 
the international fence about 60 miles southwest of tucson and 
headed north into the searing heat of the desert 
although members of the group said they crossed the border in 
groups of four five or six people border patrol officials said 
they suspected that a coyote or border smuggler organized the 
attempt

the supreme court today unanimously struck down 
a former pennsylvania deadline allowing mothers of illegitimate 
children a maximum of six years to sue alleged fathers for child 
support 
six years does not necessarily provide a reasonable opportunity 
to assert a claim on behalf of an illegimate child justice sandra 
day oconnor wrote for the court which held that the deadline once 
imposed by pennsylvania for paternity lawsuits was unconstitutional 
the justices in 1982 unanimously struck down a state laws ban on 
paternity suits not filed within one year of the childs birth in 
1983 the court unanimously struck down a twoyear deadline for such 
suits 
that 1983 decision hinted that the court might frown on state 
laws preventing mothers from suing on behalf of any minor child in 
effect condoning an 18year deadline for paternity suits 
todays decision again offered such hints but the court stopped 
short of saying so explicitly 
in other action today the high court 
ruled unanimously that states may not prohibit groups from 
paying those who gather petition signatures necessary to place a 
referendum on state ballots 
decided unanimously in a case from illinois that states may give 
protection to workers beyond that provided by federal labor law so 
long as it doesnt force courts to interpret collective bargaining 
agreements 
agreed to decide whether railroads may require all employees 
involved in serious accidents to submit to drug testing 
let stand the rape conviction of an illinois man who wanted a 
judge to examine privately the conversations his victim had with 
rape crisis counselors 
refused 63 to order states to give refunds to businesses when 
a state tax is invalidated as a violation of interstate commerce 
on the issue of paternity suit deadlines congress called for 
such 18year deadlines in the child support enforcement amendments 
of 1984 but the justices passed up the chance to rule whether the 
1984 federal law is binding on the states 
instead the court ruled that pennsylvanias former sixyear 
deadline violated constitutional rights of equal protection under 
the law because legitimate children may sue for parental support at 
any time 
the case involved in todays ruling stemmed from the 1973 birth 
in pittsburgh of tiffany clark 
tiffanys mother cherlyn clark sued gene jeter in 1983 after he 
stopped making voluntary intermittent contributions to tiffanys 
support 
according to court documents blood tests showed a 993 percent 
probability that jeter was tiffanys father 
jeter defending himself against the paternity suit cited the 
sixyear statute of limitations then in effect for such suits 
while the litigation was pending pennsylvania changed the 
relevant statute of limitations to 18 years 
a state appeals court upheld the sixyear deadline and the 
pennsylvania supreme court refused to hear ms clarks appeal 
today the high court provided ms clark with a legal victory by 
sending her case back to a state trial court 
in her opinion oconnor noted that pennsylvania law places no 
time limit on lawsuits filed by illegitimate children who sue to 
prove paternity for purposes of inheritance 
she also noted that pennsylvania does not impose any deadline for 
lawsuits filed by men trying to prove paternity 
it is questionable whether a state acts reasonably when it 
requires most paternity and support actions to be brought within six 
years of an illegitimate childs birth oconnor said 
the case is clark vs jeter 875565

explosions damaged commuter 
railroads and zulu officials said nine bus passengers were injured 
by a fire bomb today as hundreds of thousands of black workers and 
students joined a general strike 
the scheduled threeday protest is the longest nationwide strike 
called in several years it takes place under new bans on political 
activity by major antiapartheid groups and black union federations 
which helped organize the strike 
mangosuthu buthelezi who heads the black homeland of kwazulu and 
an opponent of the protest said four people were killed when a hand 
grenade was thrown at a commuter bus later an aide to buthelezi 
said the report had been incorrect and that nine passengers were 
injured when a fire bomb was thrown at the vehicle 
police said five were hurt in the incident 
no injuries were reported in bombing attacks on railway lines and 
buses near johannesburg and pretoria or in the firebombing of the 
umgababa station near amanzimtoti a black township outside durban 
mining companies reported absentees only in some coal mines gold 
and diamond mines accounting for more than 60 percent of the 
countrys foreign currency earnings operated normally 
black union leaders who called for a national protest without 
saying that it should be a general strike said they hoped to 
pressure big business into demanding that the government ease its 
crackdown on opponents of apartheid 
protest organizers called on workers to oppose a labor bill 
before parliament and restrictions on political activity but 
employers and union officials concede that the main purpose of the 
strike is to test the strength of banned antiapartheid groups 
there was no official estimate of the number of people 
participating in the protest but based on the number of people who 
normally use public transport the absentees in major cities would 
have totalled several hundred thousand 
the government railroad service and private bus companies that 
carry black workers from townships into city centers in transvaal 
and natal provinces termed the general strike highly effective 
absentee rates for black workers ranged from 30 percent in 
pretoria to 95 percent in durban and an estimated 8090 percent in 
cape town port elizabeth known as a center of political unrest 
had a near normal turnout 
the federated chamber of industries said the johannesburg area 
was the hardest hit by the strike with a 90 percent absentee rate 
among the black work force 
the johannesburg stock exchange reported an almost total strike 
by its black workers and the streets were empty and quiet 
there were few milk or bakery deliveries since most truck 
drivers are black hospital supervisors in a johannesburg medical 
clinic had to wash floors and clean toilets and whites operated 
cash registers at many shops which were empty of the usual crowds 
of black customers 
the south african automobile industry came to a standstill with 
all seven major assembly plants closing for three days 
many employers who normally institute a policy of no work no 
pay during such illegal general strikes reacted more strongly this 
time obtaining court orders to prevent calls to strike and 
threatening to dismiss absentees or cancel union contracts 
the unions accused the managers of cooperating with alleged 
government efforts to weaken the black labor movement 
the national black chamber of commerce supported the protest and 
agreed to close businesses through wednesday 
but in some townships near cape town blacks were seen walking to 
adjacent mixedrace communities to do their shopping and catch taxis 
to work some cities reported more black worker turnout as the day 
progressed 
scores of schools were empty in black townships around soweto 
cape town and durban and three universities delayed final 
examinations or canceled classes 
buses were stoned and there were reports of police gunfire in 
guguletu a black township outside cape town journalists were 
ordered from the area 
police and soldiers were reported patrolling in greater than 
normal numbers in cape town and johannesburgarea townships and 
standing guard at some train stations 
apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the nations 5 million whites control the economy

the supreme court set aside the death sentence 
of a convicted maryland murderer by a 54 vote today saying it 
could not be sure he received a fair sentence 
in a separate decision the court ruled unanimously that a 
convicted oklahoma killer was wrongly sentenced to death for having 
committed an especially heinous atrocious or cruel crime 
both ralph mills in maryland and william thomas cartwright in 
oklahoma are entitled to new sentencing trials the court said 
mills was in the second year of a 30year prison sentence for 
murder when he used a makeshift knife to kill paul robin brown in 
the cell they shared at a state prison in hagerstown md 
prison authorities said that prior to the aug 6 1984 murder 
mills had threatened to kill a previous cellmate if mills 
complaints about visiting rights and other matters were not resolved 
mills was convicted and sentenced to death for browns murder 
in challenging the sentence mills lawyers argued that jurors 
who sentenced him did not understand the judges instructions about 
determining whether any mitigating circumstances existed 
such mitigating factors indicate that life in prison rather than 
death is the appropriate punishment 
mills lawyers contended that the jurors thought they had to be 
unanimous in finding any mitigating circumstance and as a result 
found none 
mills appeal argued that if 11 jurors agreed that there were six 
mitigating circumstances but one juror found none the jury would 
have to report that no mitigating circumstance existed 
the result the appeal said could be that the death penalty was 
imposed even though 11 jurors might think it was wholly 
inappropriate 
the maryland court of appeals the states highest court ruled 
that the judges instructions to jurors could be read in a way that 
preserved mills death sentence 
but writing for the high court today justice harry a blackmun 
said there is a substantial probability that reasonable jurors 
in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed may 
well have thought they were precluded from considering any 
mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of 
a particular such circumstance 
if that were the case blackmun said it would violate past 
supreme court rulings that the sentencer must be permitted to 
consider all mitigating evidence 
the possibility that a single juror could block such 
consideration and consequently require the jury to impose the death 
penalty is one we dare not risk blackmun said 
joining him were justices william j brennan byron r white 
thurgood marshall and john paul stevens 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy voted to uphold 
mills sentence 
the instructions on the sentencing form and the charges given 
to the jury in this case are unexceptionable and mills sentence 
should be upheld rehnquist said 
in the case from oklahoma cartwright was convicted of killing 
hugh riddle his former boss at riddles muskogee county home in 
1982 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals upheld cartwrights murder 
conviction but threw out his death sentence last year 
the appeals court ruled that oklahoma courts had interpreted part 
of the states death penalty law in an impermissibly overbroad way 
a view with which the supreme court unanimously agreed today 
oklahoma juries considering whether to impose death or life in 
prison for convicted murderers are told to weigh all aggravating 
circumstances against all mitigating circumstances 
one of eight aggravating circumstances specified under oklahoma 
law is whether the murder was especially heinous atrocious or 
cruel 
the supreme court ruled in 1980 that a similarly worded 
aggravating circumstance in georgia law could be applied only to 
cases in which the victim suffered serious physical abuse before 
death 
after cartwrights sentencing oklahoma courts have restricted 
the heinous atrocious or cruel language to those murders in 
which torture or serious physical abuse occurred 
justice byron r white writing for the court today said 
cartwrights sentence was based on an unconstitutionally vague 
aggravating circumstance 
the cases are mills vs maryland 875367 and maynard vs 
cartwright 87519

explosions damaged commuter 
railroads and zulu officials said nine bus passengers were injured 
by a fire bomb today as hundreds of thousands of black workers and 
students joined a general strike 
the scheduled threeday protest is the longest nationwide strike 
called in several years it takes place under new bans on political 
activity by major antiapartheid groups and black union federations 
which helped organize the strike 
mangosuthu buthelezi who heads the black homeland of kwazulu and 
an opponent of the protest said four people were killed when a hand 
grenade was thrown at a commuter bus later an aide to buthelezi 
said the report had been incorrect and that nine passengers were 
injured when a fire bomb was thrown at the vehicle 
police said five were hurt in the incident 
no injuries were reported in bombing attacks on railway lines and 
buses near johannesburg and pretoria or in the firebombing of the 
umgababa station near amanzimtoti a black township outside durban 
mining companies reported absentees only in some coal mines gold 
and diamond mines accounting for more than 60 percent of the 
countrys foreign currency earnings operated normally 
black union leaders who called for a national protest without 
saying that it should be a general strike said they hoped to 
pressure big business into demanding that the government ease its 
crackdown on opponents of apartheid 
protest organizers called on workers to oppose a labor bill 
before parliament and restrictions on political activity but 
employers and union officials concede that the main purpose of the 
strike is to test the strength of banned antiapartheid groups 
there was no official estimate of the number of people 
participating in the protest but based on the number of people who 
normally use public transport the absentees in major cities would 
have totalled several hundred thousand 
the government railroad service and private bus companies that 
carry black workers from townships into city centers in transvaal 
and natal provinces termed the general strike highly effective 
absentee rates for black workers ranged from 30 percent in 
pretoria to 95 percent in durban and an estimated 8090 percent in 
cape town port elizabeth known as a center of political unrest 
had a near normal turnout 
the federated chamber of industries said the johannesburg area 
was the hardest hit by the strike with a 90 percent absentee rate 
among the black work force 
the johannesburg stock exchange reported an almost total strike 
by its black workers and the streets were empty and quiet 
there were few milk or bakery deliveries since most truck 
drivers are black hospital supervisors in a johannesburg medical 
clinic had to wash floors and clean toilets and whites operated 
cash registers at many shops which were empty of the usual crowds 
of black customers 
the south african automobile industry came to a standstill with 
all seven major assembly plants closing for three days 
many employers who normally institute a policy of no work no 
pay during such illegal general strikes reacted more strongly this 
time obtaining court orders to prevent calls to strike and 
threatening to dismiss absentees or cancel union contracts 
the unions accused the managers of cooperating with alleged 
government efforts to weaken the black labor movement 
the national black chamber of commerce supported the protest and 
agreed to close businesses through wednesday 
but in some townships near cape town blacks were seen walking to 
adjacent mixedrace communities to do their shopping and catch taxis 
to work some cities reported more black worker turnout as the day 
progressed 
scores of schools were empty in black townships around soweto 
cape town and durban and three universities delayed final 
examinations or canceled classes 
buses were stoned and there were reports of police gunfire in 
guguletu a black township outside cape town journalists were 
ordered from the area 
police and soldiers were reported patrolling in greater than 
normal numbers in cape town and johannesburgarea townships and 
standing guard at some train stations 
apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the nations 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services

productivity a key measure of the us 
economys competitiveness improved at an annual rate of 36 percent 
the first quarter of 1988 the government said today 
the improved efficiency of nonfarm businesses in churning out 
goods and services from january through march was four times the 09 
percent gain reported in preliminary figures last month 
the increase compared with an 08 percent improvement in 
productivity for all of 1987 last years figure included a 1 
percent decline the last quarter nearly negating a 42 percent 
improvement the third quarter 
the commerce department reported two weeks ago that the economy 
as measured by the gross national product the total output of 
goods and services in the country was 39 percent the first 
quarter instead of 23 percent as earlier estimated 
output among nonfarm businesses ressponsible for threefourths 
of the nations economic activity grew at a much healthier 59 
percent the labor department said today more than double the 
earlier growth estimate of 27 percent 
to achieve the higher output businesses increased their total 
employee hours by 22 percent up from an earlier estimate of 17 
percent 
the departments report on productivity and costs indicated that 
services rather than manufacturing accounted for most of the 
improved efficiency a reversal of past trends 
in manufacturing the revised productivity figures showed a 28 
percent improvement for the quarter down slightly from the 29 
percent earlier estimate 
the revised manufacturing output increase was 45 percent instead 
of 43 percent the additional hours worked to achieve the increase 
totaled 16 percent instead of 13 percent as reported earlier 
meanwhile hourly wages in manufacturing rose at an annual rate 
of 46 percent in the first quarter the biggest increase since a 
51 percent annualized boost the last quarter of 1985 
the higher wages compared with a 39 percent increase in the 
earlier estimate and a 13 percent increase for all of 1987 raised 
the labor costs associated with each item coming off the nations 
assembly lines by 17 percent annually instead of 1 percent as 
reported earlier 
it also gave factory workers their first real wage gain 12 
percent after taking inflation into account in 1987 the real 
inflationadjusted income of manufacturing workers fell by 22 
percent 
annual hourly wage gains for all workers in nonfarm businesses 
averaged 34 percent the first quarter keeping them exactly even 
with inflation 
the labor department said the quarter was the fifth in a row 
without a real increase in hourly wages a phenomenon that has 
occurred only twice previously in 197980 and in 198081 
the labor costs associated with each unit of goods or services 
produced by nonfarm businesses declined at an annual rate of 02 
percent the first quarter compared with a 45 percent increase the 
last quarter of 1987

the governors of ohio and new york today 
proposed a national policy that would sharply reduce acid rain while 
protecting the interests of the coalproducing states 
new york gov mario cuomo and ohio gov richard celeste 
recommended in a joint statement a 10millionton reduction in 
sulfur dioxide emissions from utility sources by the year 2003 the 
proposal also would authorize 900 million a year to finance up to 
50 percent of the capital costs 
the plan will be proposed to congress as an amendment to the 
clean air act cuomo and celeste both democrats said they will 
push the agreement as a compromise to the other legislative 
proposals in washington bogged down in regional fighting to 
control acid rain 
sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have been 
blamed as a major cause of acid rain which environmentalists say is 
destroying waters and woodlands in the northeast much of the sulfur 
dioxide comes from coalburning power plants along the ohio river 
new york is one of eight northeastern states involved in a us 
circuit court of appeals suit in washington against the us 
environmental protection agency the states are protesting the epas 
refusal to revise the air pollution control plans of ohio michigan 
indiana kentucky tennessee west virginia and illinois to reduce 
sulfur dioxide emissions in those states 
the plan calls for reductions in sulfur dioxide emmissions in 
three phases 35 million tons by 1993 another 45 million tons by 
1998 and another 2 million tons by 2003 
states would receive about 900 million to pay for the cost of 
compliance more than twothirds would be paid by the oil industry 
and onethird by federal officials the polluters themselves would 
have to raise about 900 million under the deal 
the agreement would also establish a 10year 25 billion 
expanded clean coal technology program to achieve reductions in 
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that money would be 
handed out on the basis of 50 percent matching grants to fund 
demonstrations of new technologies 
in the joint statement cuomo said it is imperative to break 
the impasse that now exists in congress 
celestes press secretary debra phillips said the governor 
considers the agreement a balance between preserving jobs and 
cleaning up the environment 
but a state senator from ohios richest coal county republican 
robert ney from belmont county said the agreement is a hard slap 
across the face of ohios coal miners 
ney said he was upset that a deal by celeste on acid rain might 
conflict with the ohio legislatures endorsement last week of a 
resolution calling on that states congressional delegation to 
oppose the clean air act and tighter sulfur dioxide emissions 
ohio environmental protection agency director richard shank said 
the lawsuit is not involved in the agreement 
in albany ny cuomos chief spokesman gary fryer said the 
proposal stemmed from a discussion between the two governors last 
july at a meeting of the national democratic governors association 
on mackinac island mich

president reagan said today his greatest 
victory at the moscow summit came not in superpower negotiations but 
in the words of faith words of freedom words of truth that he 
gave to the soviet people 
it made me feel humble thats the only way you could feel it 
made me think that visiting moscow on behalf of the american people 
was one of the highest privileges of my life reagan said a speech 
summing up his talks last week with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
noting how much things have changed because of the friendly 
outcome of the fiveday summit reagan began by greeting the soviet 
delegation attending his address before the world gas conference 
the president said he left moscow with an impression of change 
an impression of new possibilities of new hope stemming from 
gorbachevs economic and social reforms 
reagan said he was encouraged by his talks with gorbachev on arms 
control regional and bilateral matters and human rights and his 
meetings with soviet dissidents refuseniks and russian orthodox 
monks 
he recalled one published report about an elderly woman who had 
witnessed the presidents stroll through a moscow street and was 
quoted as saying i like it that he says god bless you 
there perhaps lies the greatest significance of what took place 
in moscow last week not that ronald reagan spoke there reagan 
said 
i was only giving voice to the abiding beliefs of the american 
people indeed of free people everywhere 
no it was that the words that were spoken were words of faith 
words of freedom words of truth unarmed truth is irresistible 
since the end of the may 29june 2 summit reagan has portrayed 
his sessions with gorbachev as a turning point in eastwest affairs 
on saturday reagan said his kremlin talks sowed the seeds of 
freedom and greater trust that he hopes will lead to increased 
liberty for the soviet people 
i just have to believe that in ways we may not even be able to 
guess those seeds will take root and grow the president said in 
his weekly radio address from the oval office 
the president pointed to his and gorbachevs exchange of 
ratification documents for the treaty banning mediumrange nuclear 
missiles calling it the event that held perhaps the most 
immediate historic importance during the summit 
the two leaders had signed the accord at their last meeting in 
december 
the significance of this treaty can hardly be overstated 
reagan said noting that it marks the first agreement banning an 
entire class of missiles 
these missiles will not simply have been shuffled around on the 
map or placed in storage they will have been destroyed he said 
although the two sides remained far apart on many matters 
involving a new treaty slashing the far more dangerous strategic 
nuclear missiles reagan said he and the soviet leader moved 
ahead on the issue 
on other matters reagan said he and gorbachev agreed that the 
soviet withdrawal from afghanistan could serve as a model for 
settling other regional conflicts 
and turning to one of the most contentious issues of the summit 
the president pointed to a key part of his agenda human rights 
recently the soviets have begun to show somewhat more respect 
for human rights he said noting the release of some 300 
political detainees 
the president also mentioned his own meetings with students and 
with nearly 100 dissidents and refuseniks those who opposed soviet 
policies or have been refused permission to leave the soviet union 
it is my hope that what took place in my moscow visit will lead 
to still greater individual freedom for the peoples of the soviet 
union he said

it looks like a childs rattle but it is 
made of clay and was placed in a communal grave on the island of 
crete almost 4000 years ago 
the unique find from a minoan cemetery outside the village of 
arkhanes is a sistrum a percussion instrument used at religious 
ceremonies in ancient times 
in more than 100 years of digging on crete the home of europes 
first high civilization in the bronze age nobody had ever unearthed 
a restorable musical instrument 
its the first time weve recovered a sound created by the 
minoansweve got a noise they heard said yiannis sakellarakis 
the archaeologist who made the discovery last summer 
its a light sound thats hard to describeclear and distinct 
but an earthy sort of note he said in a weekend interview 
the minoan civilization is named after king minos a legendary 
ruler who kept a halfman halfbull monster called the minotaur 
imprisoned in a labyrinth beneath his palace at knossos 
arkhanes is 10 miles south of knossos in a hilly but fertile 
winegrowing district of central crete that was densely populated in 
minoan times 
the sistrum is a flat 4inch diameter circle of unpainted clay 
with a handle the face had two parallel wooden slats across it and 
clay discs were slotted loosely between the slats 
if you shook the instrument from side to side youd get a 
light rythmic sound from the discs rattling against each other and 
the clay frame said sakellarakis a director of greeces national 
archaeological museum 
its a fantastic find we know there was ritual drinking at 
minoan burials and perhaps this indicates there was music and 
singing or chanting as well said sandy mcgillivray an associate 
professor of archaeology at columbia university in new york 
the sistrum was unearthed in a stonewalled burial chamber or 
ossuary containing the skeletons and personal items of more than 
150 minoans the grave offerings were mostly vases but included 
carved ivory seals that probably belonged to the wealthier members 
of a family clan 
sakellarakis said the sistrum apparently dates from around 1900 
bc some painted clay cups from that period were found next to the 
instrument 
we found the clay circle broken into two pieces then we 
associated it with the three discs and realized wed got a very 
early sistrum he said 
music and dancing were part of a sophisticated ancient lifestyle 
on crete illustrated in wallpaintings sealstones and carved stone 
vases found in the sprawling minoan palaces and country villas built 
throughout the island 
one vase made around 1500 bc shows a middleaged man 
brandishing a sistrum as he leads a group of singing worshipers 
sakellarakis said the sistrums found in egypt were invariably 
made of metal not clay and usually were associated with the cult 
of isis isis was worshipped in ancient egypt as a goddess of 
fertility who could also cure the sick 
sakellarakis and his wife effie have excavated around arkhanes 
since the mid1960s in addition to the cemetery excavation they 
have unearthed part of a minoan palace in arkhanes and a shrine on 
nearby mount iuktas where it is believed the minoans carried out a 
human sacrifice

british balloonist per lindstrand broke the 
world altitude record for a hotair balloon today floating more 
than 11 miles above the earths surface his spokeswoman said 
after a 3hour flight in his pressurized gondola lindstrand 
landed about 70 miles northeast of his launch site some 27 miles 
north of laredo 
it was an ideal landing said lisa boell a spokeswoman for 
lindstrands crew 
ms boell said linstrand set an unofficial record at 58700 at 
702 am lindstrand topped the 55134foot record set in 1980 by 
julian nott last year lindstrand and richard brandson became the 
first people to cross the atlantic in a hotair balloon 
houston air traffic control officials who were tracking 
lindstrands balloon on radar said the swedishborn engineer had 
topped 58700 feet at 710 am 
two sealed cameras that automatically filmed the crafts 
altimeter readings and a barograph strapped to the outside of the 
craft will be examined to verify the record 
lindstrands return to earth was delayed by natural solar heating 
inside the balloon a spokesman said when he had dropped to 12000 
feet lindstrand relit the butane burners on the craft to slow his 
fall at that point he was falling at 500 feet per minute 
lindstands stratoquest lifted off at 542 am just three 
minutes after he and his wife arrived at the launch site lindstrand 
hoped the 200000 flight would break the 60000feet barier 
considered until now to be technically impossible because of a lack 
of oxygen in the atmosphere needed for the balloons burners 
his assault on the world record first scheduled for june 1 was 
repeatedly delayed because of storms or high wind 
on sunday launch master paul dickenson aborted the flight for 
the fifth time when ground wind proved too strong only 10 minutes 
from the proposed liftoff time 
a problem at liftoff left two of four 100pound sandbags attached 
to the balloon threatening the mission project coordinator pete 
mason said but lindstrand climbed out of his capsule to cut away 
the sandbags 
its obviously very risky but if you recall when he took off 
for his atlantic flight he lost a fuel tank and also had 500 pounds 
of sand bags still attached mason said he climbed out at 8000 
feet and cut them free and still managed to cross the atlantic 
last year lindstrand and brandson a british millionaire became 
the first people to cross the atlantic in a hot air balloon but 
explosive charges that were to release their capsule failed and the 
two ended up in the irish sea for 2 hours 
the transatlantic flight set hot air balloon records for speed 
at 100 mph duration at 31 hours and 41 minutes and distance at 
3075 miles

being charged with false advertising can cost a 
company millions of dollars even if no fine is ever levied the 
federal trade commission reported monday 
at the same time the commission announced that the marketer of 
dream away diet pills has agreed to set up a 11 million fund to 
repay consumers in a false advertising case 
when false advertising charges are brought against a company the 
market price of that companys stock declines often significantly 
the commission said in its analysis of the effects of advertising 
regulation 
for a company with a value of 500 million the drop in stock 
prices could amount to 20 million in lost value according to david 
scheffman director of the ftcs bureau of economics 
this decline is a measure of the markets estimate of the problem 
the company will have in selling its products as a result of the 
false advertising charges commission chairman daniel oliver said 
thus while the commission rarely levies fines against companies 
in advertising cases just bringing the accusation has a significant 
effect even if the charges eventually are dropped 
generally when the ftc brings false advertising charges the 
case is settled with a consent agreement in which the company 
while not admitting any wrongdoing promises not to do it again 
only if there is a subsequent violation of that promise are fines 
likely 
such instances are rare oliver noted the companies having 
already suffered damage to reputation costs of litigation and loss 
of stock value and business 
the study focused on 122 cases between 1962 and 1985 in which the 
ftc brought false advertising charges in 74 cases the companies 
agreed to a consent order settling the case while 48 contested the 
case 
in the cases settled by consent order the companies stock value 
lost an average of 25 percent in the five days following the 
announcement the study found 
the greatest effect was seen in cases in which a company 
contested the ftc charges in court but eventually lost abnormal 
stock price losses averaged 12 percent at the time of the 
complaint 18 percent when the administrative law judge ruled and 
19 percent on final commission action 
those cases generate considerably more negative publicity oliver 
said compared with ones in which they go quietly 
by comparison the ftc study found little effect on businesses 
from two other systems of advertising regulation the national 
advertising division of the better business bureaus and the lanham 
act which allows businesses to sue one another for false 
advertising 
while involvement in any type of false advertising case can 
damage a companys reputation those generated by the ftc tend to 
get widespread news media coverage while the other two systems get 
little media attention the ftc said 
in the dream away case nutri marketing of scottsdale ariz 
agreed to set up the 11 million fund to reimburse buyers of its 
dream away and advances dream away products 
those products consisted of a 21day supply of pills sold for 
1995 which were advertised as a means of losing weight while 
sleeping dream away does not cause weight loss without diet or 
exercise and does not contribute to the loss effects of diet and 
exercise the commission said 
consumers who have purchased dream away and who want to determine 
if they are eligible for a refund can write nancy warder the 
federal trade commission 6th street and pennsylvania avenue nw

handwritten notes by an evan mecham 
campaign aide may be used as evidence in the former governors 
criminal trial on charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan a 
judge ruled today 
however the three pages of notes by former mecham finance 
committee member vern gasser may not be introduced as exhibits 
unless the defense offers them the judge said 
some contend that the notes written in fall 1986 by gasser 
appear to reflect a discussion on whether to disclose the 350000 
campaign loan from developer barry wolfson 
the notes say show evan borrowed money and dont show 
borrowed money 
gasser testified friday that he could not recall when the notes 
were taken who was present at the time or what the notes meant 
maricopa county superior court judge michael ryan ruled that he 
would not allow the notes themselves to be introduced as exhibits 
unless the defense requests it so the jurors will not place undue 
emphasis on them 
ryan noted they were made at meetings that dealt with intimate 
campaign strategy and finances even though gasser said he could no 
longer remember what they meant 
the prosecution wanted the notes introduced as evidence but joe 
keilp attorney for mechams brother and codefendant willard 
mecham said friday he was concerned they could be used to imply 
that the statements might have been made by willard mecham or by 
evan mechams former chief of staff jim colter 
mecham is charged with six felony counts of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents he faces up to 22 years in 
prison if convicted on all counts willard mecham who was his 
brothers 1986 campaign treasurer faces three similar counts and up 
to 9 years in prison 
the former governor has long contended that the 350000 loan was 
properly reported as part of a 465000 lump sum that was listed on 
financial reports as a contribution from mecham 
the prosecution said in opening statements last week that 
mechams gubernatorial campaign badly needed the money but wanted to 
conceal the fact that it came from a developer because mecham 
portrayed himself as being beholden to no one 
mecham a republican took office in january 1987 he was removed 
from office april 4 when the senate convicted him of two unrelated 
impeachment counts 
he also was impeached in connection with the 350000 loan but 
the senate decided not to hear that charge to avoid prejudicing his 
criminal trial

a moderate earthquake shook southeastern 
alaska early today but there were no immediate reports of damage or 
injuries the alaska tsunami warning center reported 
the 701 am temblor measured 52 on the richter scale and was 
centered on the mainland about 80 miles southeast of yakutat or 130 
miles northwest of juneau said george carte a warning center 
spokesman 
in washington don finley a spokesman for the us geological 
survey said earthquake monitors in golden colo recorded the 
tremor at a preliminary magnitude of 48 on the richter scale 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 time 
stronger than one of 65 an earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause 
considerable damage 
the 1964 good friday earthquake in alaska measured 85 on the 
richter scale and was centered in prince william sound it generated 
large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed 
at least 114 people as far south as oregon and hawaii

climate changes caused by the greenhouse 
effect will make deserts hotter and tropical storms more severe in 
coming decades and threaten cities with floods from rising seas 
scientists said monday 
they urged governments to plan for the trouble and to adopt 
policies that will lessen the effects 
in their report an international group of scientists urged 
curbing coalfired power stations that emit carbon dioxide limiting 
the use of other gases that create a greenhouse effect in the 
atmosphere and coordinating government preparations for weather 
changes 
we still dont know the magnitude or rapidity with which the 
changes will occur said bert bolin a professor at stockholm 
university but it is clear that climatic problems will be part of 
peoples lives over the next century 
the study was a followup to a 1985 conference of the 
international council of scientific unions at villach austria 
which endorsed the theory that gases trap energy from the sun near 
the earths surface 
we are entering a new phase we told the world what scientists 
believe will be the case now nations and politicians must start 
to think about the problems said bolin who pioneered work on the 
greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer 
average temperatures will rise by at least 054144 degrees 
fahrenheit per decade and the increase may reach 9 degrees in the 
tropics and polar regions the report said 
warmer weather will melt polar ice packs in summer raising the 
sea level by 860 inches over the next 50 years it said 
at least 30 of the worlds largest cities including new york 
definitely will be affected said jill jaeger of the beijer 
institute of the royal institute of the academy of sciences who 
wrote the report 
even if emissions of greenhouse gases were stopped 
immediately those released over the last 100 years would raise the 
average temperature by 09 degrees and sea levels by 448 inches 
she said 
the study was sponsored by the world meteorological organization 
and the un environment program 
predicting regional effects of the climate change is difficult 
but the worldwide variance will be considerably larger than has 
been known in human history ms jaeger said 
in two dramatic examples she said more powerful storms could 
cause severe flooding in bangladesh threating 50 million people 
and floods could wash over the nile basin where 10 million 
egyptians live 
roughly half of humanity lives close to the sea she said 
adding that the united states alone will have to spend up to 100 
billion to protect its eastern seaboard 
among other effects predicted in the report are 
greater evaporation may endanger water supplies 
less rain could threaten farming in some areas while making 
agriculture possible in others leading to population shifts and 
probable migration to cities 
warming of icebound seas could have military implications in 
northern europe north america and siberia if these coastlines 
become navigable fundamental security readjustments will be 
required 
permafrost in northern canada and siberia will gradually 
disappear 
patterns of fish migration will change some trees will have 
reproduction problems and some animal species will become extinct 
it was not specific about the species involved 
the report named the greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide 
methane chlorofluorocarbons nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone 
it urged limiting emissions of the dangerous gases development 
of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels including nuclear 
energy an end to deforestation and planning dikes and other 
defenses in areas vulnerable to rising water levels

jesse jackson today threatened a floor fight at the democratic 
national convention if he doesnt get his way on declaring south 
africa a terrorist nation frontrunner michael dukakis meanwhile 
moved closer to the nomination gaining 37 former albert gore 
supporters in kentucky 
jackson and dukakis were both in california today wrapping up 
the long democratic presidential primary campaign with a final bid 
for votes in the state that provides the biggest prize in tuesdays 
fourstate finale 
vice president george bush who locked up his partys nomination 
six weeks ago was also campaigning today in california with a 
series of appearances aimed at calling attention to the drug issue 
jackson in los angeles said that california can produce an 
upset tomorrow however in a fourstate radio news conference he 
focused more on his goals for the convention next month in atlanta 
he made clear that he will press for party adoption of his 
position that south africa is a terrorist state and should be 
declared as such by the united states making it subject to further 
sanctions 
he said dukakis own unwillingness to make such a declaration so 
far was too cautious jackson added if he will not bend on 
that matter well simply meet each other on the floor in atlanta 
dukakis at a news conference today said he had talked with 
jackson sunday night by telephone and hoped to meet with him soon 
he didnt say what they would discuss but when asked about 
jacksons campaign role dukakis said if the tables were reversed 
and he was on his way to the nomination and i were the runnerup 
id expect to be deeply involved id try to bring my people 
into this id be as serviceable to the ticket as i possibly could 
im confident he will be that kind of person 
in kentucky meanwhile gov wallace wilkinson endorsed dukakis 
today and said almost all of the kentucky delegation to the 
convention will follow his lead 
the switch will mean 37 delegates formerly committed to tennessee 
sen gore have now jumped to the dukakis camp as it now stands all 
but six of kentuckys 67 delegates to the convention will be behind 
dukakis the others are pledged to jackson 
dukakis is likely to clinch his partys nomination in the final 
round of contests tuesday which also includes races in new jersey 
montana and new mexico he holds a huge delegate lead over jackson 
and is fewer than 300 delegates shy of the 2081 needed to gain the 
democratic nomination 
the massachusetts governor who declared his candidacy 13 months 
ago got off to a shaky start when he finished third in the 
seasonopening iowa caucuses in february but in the months that 
followed he methodically felled a field of rivals one by one 
only jackson remains an active competitor and he is making it 
clear he will try to remain highly visible even after tuesdays 
races 
jackson says his camp will launch a massive voterregistration 
drive on aug 1 he has said he will keep making appearances after 
tuesday and hes putting the party on notice there are issues hes 
ready to fight for at the convention 
in addition some of those around jackson are taking an 
aggressive tack on the subject of the no 2 spot on the democratic 
ticket dukakis has said jackson deserves to be looked at as a 
possible running mate but deserves no special consideration 
jacksons campaign chairman willie brown said sunday that 
jackson ought to be offered a spot on the ticket 
i think consideration means literally extending the opportunity 
to go on the ticket and then it will be up to mr jackson to 
determine whether or not he wishes to accept it brown said on 
abctvs this week with david brinkley 
jackson played down the brown comment saying thats his point 
of view but he told a church congregation sunday that the 
democratic party must make a commitment to empowerment in the 
platform in the party on the ticket 
telling the congregation in los angeles of his intention to push 
his agenda at the convention jackson used the word fight but 
he softened that when he spoke to reporters afterward 
fights come when you fail to negotiate when people have 
made a decision to go in opposite directions he said 
dukakis as he has been throughout the campaign was careful to 
avoid criticizing jackson 
as for jacksons vow to push to make certain issues part of the 
party platform dukakis said sunday i dont see any deep 
divisions in the party at all 
dukakis own aides have indicated he will get out and campaign 
prior to the convention to get an early start on the november 
contest against bush but the vice president cant campaign much 
until after the republican convention because he has already spent 
almost the entire 27 million the law allows for a primary campaign 
bush put some distance sunday between himself and the white house 
on the environmentally sensitive issue of offshore oil drilling 
campaigning in los angeles the vice president called for a delay 
in a controversial drilling project off northern california one 
that the interior department has been pushing ahead 
before going forward with new lease sales we must be assured 
that the national treasure of the california coastline will not be 
harmed the vice president said 
dukakis jabbed at bush on the subject today saying im 
pleased hes coming around but its kind of late im not for 
delaying that sale im for canceling it

former defense minister vp singh 
characterizes his campaign for parliament in the june 16 elections 
as a fight of money power versus peoples power 
his main opponent for the seat from the central city of allahabad 
is singer and scriptwriter sunil shastri who says the race is a 
clash of political ideologies 
most people however see the singhshastri race in uttar pardesh 
state as a test of strength for prime minister rajiv gandhis 
governing congress party 
it is one of seven byelections for seats in the lower house of 
parliament the election will also decide 10 state assembly seats 
 
a defeat in uttar pradesh would signal further weakness for 
gandhis party which has fared badly in local contests it lost 10 
of 14 state assembly elections in the past two years 
uttar pardesh is indias most populous state and a bastion of the 
hindispeaking population which dominates indias politics in the 
form of the congress party 
allahabad a city of 700000 people is 350 miles southeast of 
new delhi 
sixtyeight other candidates are running for the seat but the 
congress party has thrown its weight behind shastri 38 the son of 
the late popular prime minister lal bahadur shastri 
the major national opposition parties have endorsed the 
56yearold singh a former gandhi ally who is now his opponent 
as defense minister singh was one of the most powerful figures 
in the gandhi administration he broke with the prime minister last 
year over the governments hesitation to investigate his allegations 
that kickbacks were paid for defense contracts some of the funds 
were believed to have gone to gandhi supporters 
singh told reporters last week that the central issue of his 
campaign remains money power versus peoples power singh 
nicknamed the raja hindi for the king is the son of the 
late raja of eastern uttar pradesh 
he says he demands a clean government as well as improved 
services such as pure drinking water adequate electricity supply 
and proper irrigation 
i personally see the race as a fight between ideologies 
shastri said 
in an interview published in the new delhibased sunday mail 
newspaper shastri emphasized that the congress party through men 
like his late father had earned the support of the people 
we had great leaders who fought in the freedom struggle from 
britain in 1947 leaders who took the country on the path of 
progress after independence he was quoted as saying 
the singhshastri contest has raised political emotions in the 
state to the boiling point 
last friday congress party workers attacked a group of young 
people loyal to singh after they staged a walkout from a congress 
party meeting one of the youths was beaten unconscious and he and 
two others required hospitalization 
the city of allahabad was shut down by a strike on saturday to 
protest the violence

israels battle to stop the sixmonth arab 
uprising is hitting palestinian and foreign journalists reporters 
have been arrested newspapers closed and sources silenced 
the israeli government insists journalists are jailed only for 
illegal acts palestinians and others say the press is being 
punished for reporting the truth and tarnishing israels image 
the army has arrested at least 30 palestinian journalists since 
dec 8 and jailed 20 of them for up to six months without charges 
said marty rosenbluth of al haq an arab human rights group based in 
the west bank town of ramallah 
the authorities are trying to restrict any information going 
out said rosenbluth an american from new york they are 
basically trying to block people from finding out what is happening 
here 
before the uprising authorities sometimes briefly closed one or 
another of the four palestinian newspapers in arab east jerusalem on 
charges of violating military censorship 
in the past six months they ordered a sixmonth closure of the 
palestine press service a news agency serving the foreign press 
and shut down al awda an affiliated weekly published in english and 
arabic 
during a tour of the ketziot prison in israels negev desert 
foreign reporters met six palestinian journalists who had been 
detained without trial 
qassem ali a freelance reporter who worked part time for the 
associated press said authorities accused him of being politically 
active 
but i believe i am here because i am a journalist said ali 
who had escorted foreign television crews and reporters through gaza 
strip refugee camps and arranged interviews 
one recently released detainee is samaan khouri a reporter for 
the french news agency agence france presse and former editor of the 
englishlanguage edition of al fajr a propalestine liberation 
organization newspaper in jerusalem 
khouri said authorities did not really mind reports of the 
uprising reaching the arab population but they were worried about 
the help palestinian journalists gave to the foreign press 
israeli officials deny the government is trying to muzzle the 
press 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said recently measures have not 
been taken against newspapers or journalists because of their 
professional activity but because of violations against israels 
laws 
he did not elaborate and the army refused to explain why it is 
holding arab journalists or how many of them are in jail 
in covering the uprising the foreign press often has depended on 
palestinian sources for the first news of violence and for 
understanding the palestinian viewpoint part of the reason has been 
the armys slowness in issuing reports 
the role of the palestinian press has been more of a bridge to 
the outside world than anything having to do with the intefadeh 
uprising itself said khouri who served 4 months in ramle 
prison 
many of the arab journalists arrested have escorted foreign 
reporters to the occupied territories arranged interviews and 
helped gain details on protests and clashes 
thats why the israelis closed down the palestine press service 
and arrested journalists who have contacts with the foreign press 
said khouri they want to cut off these relations 
he also attributed his arrest to being on the executive committee 
of the palestine journalists union representing 160 arab reporters 
the groups leader rajwan abu ayyash was freed from jail a few 
days after khouri government officials said the release followed an 
appeal by the israeli journalists union 
amnon nadav the union leader said jewish journalists have 
fought for the release of detained palestinian reporters since the 
beginning of the uprising 
we regard them as professional colleagues and view their 
detention as the beginning of a process that could affect us all 
nadav said 
leftwing israeli media also are affected by the governments 
efforts to control coverage of the uprising 
in february the government revoked the printing license of 
derech nanitzotz a communist weekly run by israeli jews and printed 
in hebrew and arabic 
in may the government charged four of the papers editors with 
being members of the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine a moscowaffiliated faction of the plo 
hadas lahav a derech hanitzotz editor released after 12 days of 
police questioning said the papers closing and charges against her 
colleagues were part of a campaign to silence coverage of the unrest 
she said the government trumped up charges against her colleagues 
to stop them from reporting on the unrest

the navy has awarded a contract to a dutch firm 
to transport the damaged frigate uss samuel b roberts home from the 
persian gulf aboard a heavylift ship the service said monday 
the contract was awarded last week to wijsmuller transport of 
ijmuiden the netherlands and totals 1325 million said navy 
spokeswoman marge holtz 
it calls for the firm to use its semisubmersible heavylift 
ship mighty servant 2 to pick up and carry the roberts from 
dubai in the united arab emirates to bath maine where it is to be 
repaired at the bath iron works 
the guidedmissile frigate which is based at newport ri was 
badly ripped by an underwater mine on april 14 shortly after 
completing a convoy operation for a reflagged kuwaiti tanker navy 
officials have said the roberts almost certainly would have sunk had 
it not been for the performance of its crew of roughly 200 
the navy announced last month it had solicited bids from maritime 
operators of heavylift ships to carry the roberts home saying such 
a move would be preferable to performing extensive repairs in dubai 
and then towing it 
the mighty servant 2 one of about two dozen such heavylift 
ships in operation measures 558 feet long and 132 feet wide it is 
designed to sink underneath its cargo and then deballast or 
rise up bringing its cargo out of the water 
such ships are used frequently to handle large oil derricks the 
mighty servant 2 can cruise at about 14 knots when underway 
according to the navy there is only one such ship in the us 
fleet and it is assigned to the military sealift command and 
deployed with a wartime readiness force at diego garcia in the 
indian ocean 
it would be prohibitively expensive to unload that vessel and 
there are no other usflag ships of this type available said 
ms holtz thats why we went to a foreign contractor 
the spokeswoman declined to discuss the schedule for moving the 
roberts citing security concerns last month however the navy 
said it hoped the voyage could begin before the end of june 
with the exception of approximately 10 crewmen who will ride 
the heavylift ship the crew of the uss roberts will fly to their 
home port of newport ri when their ship departs for the united 
states the navy said at the time

a wave of frivolity has overtaken the jesse 
jackson presidential campaign in the primary seasons waning days 
the sometimes goofy atmosphere with the candidate in a bouyant 
playful mood is typified by a series of silly hand signals between 
jackson and the traveling press corps 
it started when jackson noticed that reporters were mimicking 
what they said was nancy reagans crowd wave an outstretched arm 
with cupped hand wagged paradestyle 
at the end of a news conference in the watts ghetto reporters 
gave jackson the wave he waved back nancystyle 
thats how mrs reagan does it jackson explained to the 
bewildered neighborhood onlookers 
the next day when reporters were doing what they called a raisa 
gorbachev wave a sternly shaking finger jackson did it too 
then he showed off a new signal four fingers separated in pairs 
like mr spock from star trek 
the goofiness continued at almost every campaign stop jackson 
waving to the press corps from the stage and car on friday he 
decided to teach a handful of baffled montana supporters the spock 
sign 
one woman wanted to know if a simple handshake wouldnt suffice 
jackson smiled and kept showing her how to position her fingers 
as his limousine slowly drove away all that could be seen was 
his arm poking out from the darkened window in a nancy wave at the 
press bus 
his good mood continued in bakersfield where he shouldered a 
cameramans boom mike and sound equipment upon returning to his 
hotel and mimed the staggering backward walk that he is accustomed 
to seing in front of him 
he wouldnt relinquish the equipment until the laughing press 
corps started shouting action jackson a slogan that he often 
gets his audiences to chant

back in los angeles before a wellheeled crowd of celebrity 
supporters it was clear that jacksons standard motivational talk 
the one he uses to give hope to the downtrodden wouldnt be quite 
appropriate 
he usually entreats his listeners not to shrink from doing their 
best in life to pursue an education and eschew the downward spiral 
of drugs and despair but that message was not exactly relevant for 
this group of successful black entertainers and business people 
so jackson tailored the message for them 
as i become president you can head your studio as i become 
president you can be chief surgeon of the hospital 
as i become president you can distribute records not just sing

twinkle twinkle little star how we wonder 
where you are up above the lights you stare but we cant see you 
for their glare twinkle twinkle star so fine hidden by the citys 
shine 
so might go the lament of amateur astronomers lobbying officials 
to turn down the city lights so they can get a better view of the 
heavens 
the amateur astronomers association of pittsburgh is seeking 
restrictions on street and building lighting to reduce what they 
call light pollution artificial light interferes with their 
ability to stargaze 
i dont plan on giving up tom reiland association president 
and an astronomer at allegheny observatory said recently i feel 
this is a worthwhile effort 
the dramatic lighting of fifth avenue place a new skyscraper in 
downtown pittsburgh was muted after the astronomers complained 
although hillman properties vice president john markey said the 
change came as workers focused the lights not because of the 
astronomers plea

panicstricken victims screamed for help and some 
feared nuclear war had broken out when a train explosion flattened 
houses and shot flames and a mushroom cloud skyward pravda reported 
monday 
the accident in arzamas an industrial city in the soviet unions 
volga valley about 240 miles east of moscow occurred saturday when 
three boxcars of a freight train loaded with industrial explosives 
blew up 
automobiles were tossed in the air and windows were shattered as 
far as a mile away soviet media said 
the official soviet news agency tass reported the death toll at 
73 pravda the communist party newspaper said it might be 
impossible to finally determine how many people died in the city of 
90000 
first i saw a high column of flames shoot up then i heard a 
rumbling and then a great mushroom cloud rose pravda quoted a 
witness v dormidontov as saying 
it quoted one unidentified weeping woman as saying the first 
thing that came to my mind was has it started a reference to a 
nuclear attack 
the report on pravdas back page was the latest in a series of 
revealing dispatches about the accident an apparent sign of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater 
openness accidents were never reported in such detail before 
gorbachev came to power in march 1985 
what shocked arzamas residents pravda said was not the 
damaged houses or destroyed cars but the crippled people calling 
for help 
the death toll likely would mount the newspaper said noting 
that rescue workers were still searching through rubble 
how is it possible to determine how many people were killed in 
cars parked nearby pravda asked 
the newspaper noted that an ambulance was destroyed in the blast 
leaving only the wheels behind we know for certain there was a 
driver a nurse and a technician in the ambulance but were there 
any patients pravda asked 
the explosion destroyed 150 homes leaving 600 families homeless 
and severely damaged another 250 buildings according to soviet 
media 
a government commission was investigating the causes of the 
explosion the deadliest on soviet railways this year the 
industrial explosives were intended for use by geologists and 
miners soviet media said 
pravda described the accident scene as being one of brief 
panic but said medical workers from moscow and nearby gorky were 
immediately notified and asked for help local residents who escaped 
injury also rushed to the aid of the victims

the military said monday it is 
considering mobilizing special reserve units to help counter 
deployment of cuban forces in southern angola 
the brief statement from military headquarters in pretoria 
confirmed newspaper reports that a callup was possible as a 
precautionary measure in the event of escalated combat 
the mobilization would involve units of the citizen force which 
includes men who have completed their obligatory twoyear military 
service but who participate in annual training camps and may be 
mobilized 
south african troops fighting in angola support the rebels 
fighting angolas marxist government angolan troops are backed by 
an estimated 45000 cuban soldiers 
south african officials have warned that the cuban buildup 
confirmed by cuban president fidel castro could jeopardize peace 
negotiations aimed at resolving angolas 13yearold civil war 
south africa has said 9000 to 15000 new cuban troops are 
involved in the latest deployment 
the peace talks also are aimed at bringing independence to 
southwest africa the south africanruled territory commonly known

south african military officials said namibian guerrillas have 
used the protection of the additional cuban troops to move their 
bases closer to the angolan border and away from south african 
troops on raids in namibia

in sharp contrast to the media assaults of 
february and march the california airwaves are nearly devoid of 
presidential advertising as the primary season draws to its 
anticlimactic close 
with the democratic and republican nominees all but chosen only 
underdog jesse jackson waged a substantial television campaign in 
the state with the largest number of convention delegates at stake 
he was hoping to spend 700000 on tv by the time the polls closed 
in california one of four states with primaries on tuesday 
republican vice president george bush nearing the 27 million 
ceiling on primary spending didnt advertise at all and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the probable democratic nominee 
expected to spend no more than 200000 on television 
realistically you have to spend far more than we anticipate 
spending to maximize the impact of advertising said dukakis 
strategist tom kiley his own schedule of appearances was the 
thing in which we were investing most heavily the most important 
element of the campaign 
alixe glen a bush spokeswoman said bush stayed off the air in 
california in large part due to the fact that we have not had an 
opponent for so long in the republican party 
dukakis limited his television advertising to los angeles and san 
francisco the idea according to kiley was to catch the attention 
of people already interested in the election and give them a little 
extra information about dukakis 
thats a very modest goal kiley said we dont pretend 
that advertising is playing a major role in the campaign 
the early part of the primary season with its multitude of gop 
and democratic candidates was rife with hardhitting often 
negative television advertising the tv campaign culminated on super 
tuesday march 8 when the presidential hopefuls competed in 20 
farflung contests in what for many of them was a doordie 
proposition 
by the time the final four primaries rolled around the focus was 
already on the general election in november 
in one california ad dukakis says the chief executive can make 
a difference in the war against drugs ive done it in my state and 
i want to do it for every state in this country 
in a companion ad an announcer describes dukakis massachusetts 
program and quotes federal agents as calling it a model for the 
nation he did it with hard work integrity leadership we 
could use some of that in the white house 
dukakis also was using a biographical spot and radio ads some in 
spanish aimed at the states black and hispanic voters 
jackson his dream of a california upset all but dead made a 
lastminute pitch for money in a 30second ad that started running 
saturday and he bought a halfhour of television time across the 
state monday night to wind up his allout drive in california 
the program part live and part prerecorded was meant to 
highlight the significance and achievements of the jackson campaign 
raise money and attract as many voters as possible actor tony 
franciosa who played the teacher mr novak on television years 
ago signed on as the moderator 
in the days preceding the primary jackson used an array of 
30second ads some old and some new on cable independent and 
network affiliate stations in fresno los angeles el centro 
sacramento salinas redding santa barbara bakersfield palm 
springs san jose san francisco eureka monterey san diego and 
reno nev 
one older ad touted jacksons success in winning the release of 
an american pilot shot down in the middle east other spots featured 
farmers saying they need jackson and actress eileen brennan praising 
the candidates stands on womens issues

gradepoint average to share topoftheclass honors on graduating 
from eighth grade 
the 14yearolds each scored 116 under a grading system in which 
an a is 1 a b is 2 etc said bush elementary school principal 
eddie lewis the lower the average the better the grades 
the two girls had identical class schedules and expect to 
continue sharing classes in high school and attend the same college 
later on

council president jerlyn vice president and they also participated 
in the same sports

lawyers for the wife of convicted spy jonathan 
jay pollard filed a motion with the us court of appeals on monday 
asking for reduction of her fiveyear prison sentence due to 
deteriorating health 
the brief seeks to overturn last decembers ruling by district 
judge aubrey robinson who rejected a request by anne 
hendersonpollard for a sentence reduction 
nathan dershowitz the attorney representing mrs 
hendersonpollard said he had asked the court either to reduce the 
sentence to the time already served to suspend her remaining 
sentence or to grant her probation 
mrs hendersonpollard was sentenced to five years imprisonment 
for conspiring to receive embezzled government property and being an 
accessory after the fact to possession of defense secrets she began 
serving her sentence on march 4 1987 the same day her husband 
began serving a life term 
pollard a civilian intelligence analyst for the us navy was 
found guilty of selling secrets to israel 
mrs hendersonpollard suffers from a rare stomach ailment and 
friends and relatives say she has lost some 60 pounds in the past 
two years she is currently at the federal correctional institution 
in rochester minnesota to undergo testing at the nearby mayo 
clinic 
the court brief contends that mrs hendersonpollard is being 
denied proper medical treatment at the lexington ky jail where she 
is usually incarcerated 
this barbarous withdrawal of treatment forced mrs pollard to 
endure excruciating pain without even the limited relief afforded 
by painkilling medication the brief said 
her father bernard henderson visited mrs pollard 10 days ago 
he said her condition was similar to survivors of death camps she 
is permanently hunched over in pain cannot stand or sit erect and 
is little but skin and bones

firefighters have been known to rescue cats 
from trees so a caller to the towns emergency communications 
center figured it was the logical place to turn for a man up a tree 
still the dispatchers at first werent sure they heard right 
said tina como 
they said do you get cats out of trees and we said no 
then they asked do you get people out of trees 
according to the dispatcher a man apparently climbed a tall tree 
saturday afternoon and was afraid to get down so somebody phoned 
for help 
i assume he was getting his cat out of the tree ms como 
said after she and other dispatchers got over what she described as 
a case of the giggles they dispatched the cary rescue squad and 
the cary volunteer fire department 
we figured youd get a man out of the tree the same way youd 
get a cat out of a tree put a bowl of food out and wait for him to 
come down she said 
after the caller phoned back to report the man had gotten down by 
himself the dispatchers recalled the firefighters 
i guess he heard those sirens and decided he didnt want to be 
embarrassed ms como said he probably let go

when illinois gov james r thompson comes to 
the nations capital he often stays at the vice presidents mansion 
the guest of his friend george bush 
this summer bush could offer thompson a chance to become a 
longerterm resident of the house on the naval observatory grounds 
now in his fourth term as governor thompson often is mentioned 
as a potential choice to be the vice presidential nominee on a 
republican ticket headed by bush 
as governor of a major battleground state in the fall election 
one that offers 24 electoral votes thompsons name would almost 
certainly turn up on most short lists of gop vice presidential 
prospects another plus is his closeness to bush 
but thompson who was elected governor of illinois in 1976 by the 
largest margin in state history has been on the lists of other 
republican presidential hopefuls and never has gotten beyond being 
one of those mentioned 
one reason is that he is one of the last of the liberal 
republicans a dwindling band of politicians in the ideological mold 
of the late nelson a rockefeller politicians left out in the cold 
in the gop of the ronald reagan era 
thompson earned the enmity of reagan loyalists in 1980 when he 
waited until may 4 to endorse the former california governor for the 
gop presidential nomination his endorsement came six weeks after 
the illinois primary and after all chance of any other republican 
overtaking reagan had been lost 
also open to question is whether thompson could guarantee the 
republican ticket would carry illinois while the 52yearold 
governors 14millionvote victory margin in 1976 was the largest 
in state history he also squeeked through to reelection in 1982 by 
5074 votes the smallest edge ever 
in that race democrat adlai e stevenson iii didnt concede 
defeat until two months after election day when the state supreme 
court rejected his request for a statewide recount 
thompson was considered vulnerable as he squared off for a 
rematch against stevenson in 1986 
stevensons chances suffered a fatal blow on primary day when a 
follower of political extremist lyndon larouche won nomination as 
lieutenant governor stevenson resigned as the democratic nominee 
for governor and ran at the head of an independent slate the 
confusion effectively doomed his chances to mount another strong 
challenge to thompson 
but even with the chaos on the democratic side thompson was 
reelected by fewer than 400000 votes out of 31 million 
the 6foot6 thompson served four years as us attorney in the 
early 1970s and earned a reputation as a crusader against corruption 
and as a man intolerant of even the appearance of impropriety by 
government officials 
it was with that reputation that he swept into office in 1976 for 
a twoyear term in 1978 he easily won reelection for the first 
fouryear term 
a native of chicago thompson is a graduate of northwestern 
university law school his wife jayne also is a lawyer

a 58 million construction project at the 
franklin institute and science museum has been halted until 
archaeologists can see if the excavation site holds any historical 
artifacts officials said monday 
excavation was halted sunday after cultural officials and 
archaeologists criticized the franklin institute for not conducting 
an archaeological survey before construction began 
well try to get people over as soon as we can said donald 
a cooke the institutes vice president for marketing fundraising 
and communication 
crews had been digging a blocklong 12footdeep hole for a 58 
million addition to the institute that will house a futures center 
which will look at science and technology that is shaping the 21st 
century said cooke 
cooke said he didnt know how the excavation halt would affect 
construction deadlines or how much money it would cost the museum 
it certainly will cost us a little bit of time and a little bit of 
money he said we think its worth doing 
the excavation is in a small portion of a fiveblock area that 
was once was the site of the magdalen society a quaker society for 
reforming prostitutes that operated for more than 100 years 
cooke said excavation in the last 10 to 30 years by the institute 
could have possibly already destroyed historical material among 
other things deep supports were built for a boeing 707 it had on 
display 
however john l cotter formerly the chief archaeologist for the 
national park services eastern region disagreed 
heavens you can have all sorts of pillars and destroy half the 
site but the point is that you still have the areas where there are 
no pillars and you have the other half of the site cotter said 
although the museum received 10 million in state money state 
officials said the usual requirement for an archaeological review 
did not apply because the money was granted directly from the 
legislature instead of through a state agency 
cooke said no one requested an archaeological review 
cooke said museum officials intend to meet with the philadelphia 
historical commission on wednesday and hope to develop a plan to 
review the site

federal regulators on monday ordered payment of 
a record 135 billion to depositors in two insolvent savings 
institutions in california 
in rare move the federal home loan bank board closed american 
diversified savings bank and north america savings and loan 
association both of costa mesa without arranging for a takeover by 
another institution 
only 10 of 235 failed sampls handled since 1981 have been resolved 
with a straight payoff of depositors usually the bank board pays a 
bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick sampl because it is cheaper 
at the very least the board arranges to transfer deposits to 
another institution 
but bank board chairman m danny wall said the unique 
characteristics of the two costa mesa thrifts made that impractical 
they had little value as going concerns because they had few retail 
deposits and lacked branch offices he said 
both also relied on highcost shortterm deposits arranged 
through brokers which they in turn lent out for speculative real 
estate ventures and other risky investments 
both institutions have been insolvent for some time regulators 
took over the management of american diversified in february 1986 
and of north america in january 1987 
the bank board is paying 114 billion from the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp to american diversified depositors in what 
wall said was the largest cash payout his agency has made it is 
covering 209 million in deposits at north america 
deposits up to the insurance limit of 100000 will be available 
beginning tuesday a total of about 500000 in both institutions 
exceeded the limit those depositors will share in liquidation 
proceeds 
these two represented abuses bank board member lawrence 
white said in an interview the whole essence of being a 
depository institution with governementprovided insurance is that 
there is a strong obligation to operate in a safe and sound 
manner these two places did not 
prior to american diversified the largest cash payout was 300 
million in 1984 to close the empire savings and loan of mesquite 
texas 
however in transactions over the last year the bank board has 
bailed out insolvent institutions for as much as 2 billion with 
most of the assistance coming in the form of notes or guarantees 
against certain kinds of future loss not cash 
the bank board expects to recover about 400 million from the 
sale of the costa mesa sampls assets it estimates the ultimate cost 
of closing american diversified at 798 million and of north america 
at 133 million 
the closing of the california associations leaves the insurance 
fund with about 19 billion in cash to handle problems elsewhere 
including the southwest where a downturn in the oil industry has 
pushed many thrifts into insolvency however it has the power to 
borrow money if necessary and is expecting 465 million in insurance 
premiums from healthy sampls this month 
regulators have said they will have about 20 billion over three 
years more than enough to resolve the cases of the 200 worst sampls 
however the general accounting office congress auditing wing 
puts the cost of cleaning up all 500 insolvent sampls between 26 
billion and 36 billion and says congress may have to come up with 
more money for the fund private analysts put the pricetag at more 
than 50 billion 
wall said closing the two california thrifts will help all sampls 
by reducing pressure to pay high interest rates failing thrifts had 
to pay high rates to get the cash needed to meet expenses and some 
healthy thrifts have had to raise their rates to compete 
north america was paying 853 percent interest on deposits 145 
percentage points above the average for all thrift institutions 
american diversified was paying 864 percent 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
said the two costa mesa sampls were prime examples of several 
score highflying institutions that in the early and mid1980s 
used federally guaranteed deposits to fuel rapid growth of shaky 
lending regulators were unprepared for the boom and failed to check 
it he said 
it was a systemic breakdown what we are seeing are two of the 
more extreme examples of it but theyre not the only ones out 
there there are others ely said 
american diversifieds assets ballooned from 11 million in 
mid1983 to 792 million at the end of 1984 but most of the assets 
were undocumented and unsecured loans for real estate and technology 
ventures the bank board said 
as of march 31 american diversified had 509 million in assets 
and 112 billion in liabilities it was losing an estimated 83 
million a month and 77 percent of its loans were bad 
north america had 982 million in assets and 2157 million in 
liabilities at the end of march it was losing an estimated 159 
million a month and 98 percent of its borrowers werent making 
payments

the judge in the irancontra case said monday 
the danger of exposing the nations most sensitive secrets posed a 
serious obstacle to pressing the conspiracy charges against oliver 
l north and three codefendants 
this was the second time in the past two weeks that us district 
judge gerhard a gesell warned that unprecedented legal problems in 
the case could curtail the rights of defendants to defend themselves 
against the conspiracy charges 
whats causing the trouble here is the conspiracy counts 
because they related to a wide course of conduct gesell told a 
hearing in which the defense said the classified information 
problems were insurmountable 
gesell who did not decide whether to retain the conspiracy 
charges which allege the defendants defrauded the government said 
nonetheless that the exposure problem could inhibit defendants 
ability to show that they acted no differently than in other covert 
operations 
when a man is accused he ought to be able to get on the stand 
and tell his side of the story if he wants to the judge said 
but that right could be restricted gesell said if a defendant 
wants to point to other secret operations and say ive been doing 
these things time and time again in other covert operations with the 
approval of cabinet officials 
the judge suggested that the prosecution might be better off 
tying counts other than conspiracy such as obstruction of congress 
making false statements to congress obstruction of a presidential 
inquiry falsifying documents conspiracy to pay illegal gratuities 
and obstruction of justice 
on another issue gesell rejected a defense pretrial request for 
topsecret documents on friday the cias top lawyer filed a 
statement contending that some of the documents are so sensitive 
that only president reagan the director of central intelligence and 
his deputy are allowed to see them 
on may 26 gesell said a trial on the conspiracy charges could be 
impossible because defendants might not have the usual trial 
privilege of confronting each other on prior statements 
such questioning might be curtailed because three of the four 
defendants testified before congress under a grant of limited 
immunity from prosecution testimony that the prosecution cant 
use and that might also be inadmissible under the defense case 
the judge and lawyers for both sides agree that no prior case had 
to deal with such extensive immunized testimony or up to 200000 
pages of classified documents 
a federal grand jury last march handed down a 23count indictment 
against north a former national security council staffer his 
onetime boss former national security adviser john m poindexter 
and two businessmen retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
and albert hakim 
the first count charges all four defendants with conspiracy to 
defraud the government by using profits from a presidentially 
approved sale of arms to iran for personal gain and to aid the 
nicaraguan contra rebels when such assistance was banned by law 
gesell revealed at mondays hearing that secord before he gave 
congressional testimony provided prosecutors with leads in the 
case secord ended up meeting with the prosecution staff nearly a 
dozen times before his indictment gesell said 
the judge said he was surprised that none of the lawyers had 
mentioned that secord had helped the prosecution a fact gesell 
said he learned from a footnote in a legal brief 
secords lawyer thomas green said the retired general acted out 
of a sense of obligation and duty and believed if he were to 
tell the truth prosecutors and members of congress would 
ultimately agree he did nothing wrong 
gesell denied motions by secord and hakim to dismiss the 
indictments against them both defendants charged that the 
prosecution refused to allow the grand jury to hear norths and 
poindexters immunized testimony which secord and hakim contended 
would have proved that the money raised from the iran arms sales 
belonged to their business enterprise not the government 
north lawyer barry simon told gesell the trial would have to stop 
every time a witness was about to refer to classified information so 
the court could decide how to proceed 
the potential is absolutely endless simon said 
but independent counsel lawrence e walsh argued the 
defendants are greatly exaggerating the problem and called the 
conspiracy count really vital as a unifying function in the 
indictment 
he said much of the difficulty would be solved by substituting 
letters and numbers for specific countries and individuals a system 
used at the congressional irancontra hearings 
gesell said the prolem was broader because of the potential need 
to describe other covert operations 
testimony about these operations could be prohibited under the 
classified information procedures act if us intelligence agencies 
were unwilling to expose the information in court

a leak of diesel fuel from a dredge 
that sank in the st marys river channel slowed monday the coast 
guard said and no damage to wildlife had been reported 
the coast guard was still working to reopen the channel to ships 
including navy submarines based at nearby st marys ga the dredge 
sank in high wind and heavy seas saturday 
a bird expert said the leaking fuel threatened nearby marshes and 
wetlands including the cumberland island national seashore the 
area has nesting sites of many species some of which are now 
raising their young 
however coast guard cmdr henry rohrs executive officer of the 
marine safety office said it appeared the fuel was not threatening 
the sensitive areas 
less diesel is coming out than during the last few days 
rohrs said it appears to be evaporating and blowing away we did 
a beach survey and found nothing no pocketing of oil on the water 
or sand just a sheen 
rohrs said the rate of leakage from the dredge crest which was 
carrying 40000 gallons of diesel fuel had fallen from 500 gallons 
an hour earlier to an estimated 100 gallons 
cindy mosling founder and director of bird emergency and kare 
sanctuary known as beaks said she hasnt heard of any bird 
injuries caused by the diesel fuel 
but she said we have nesting birds in the marshes and this 
could be very destructive there are nesting colonies in very 
critical areas they use that whole area to dive and hunt for food 
coast guard officials said they wanted to set up a temporary 
onewayatatime boat channel around the dredge while divers 
attempt to plug the leak 
we are hoping to get private divers down there to plug the 
vents but the weather has not allowed them to do that rohrs 
said its been too rough 
the closing of the channel has had no effect on commercial 
traffic since none was due in until tuesday rohrs said of 
course the navy is very concerned 
rohrs said officials were still investigating the sinking 
because the dredge company took full responsibility for the cleanup 
the coast guard was only monitoring the situation and had not had to 
spend any federal funds on removing oil rohrs said

a student who set himself afire during 
a weekend antigovernment protest died monday and 148 radical 
students were arrested while trying to leave for a rally near the 
border with north korea 
after park raechuns death was reported about 1000 students 
assembled outside seouls hangang sacred heart hospital shouting 
yankee go home park had been hospitalized there since his 
selfimmolation saturday 
students formed a committee and decided to hold a democratic 
peoples funeral for the 24yearold junior from soongshil 
university the burial site was not announced 
at one point monday about 500 of the students outside the 
hospital shouted slogans against the government and the united 
states police did not intervene 
other police rounded up 20 dissident students at a seoul bus 
terminal and 128 students at the munsan railway station 25 miles 
north of the capital officials said 
the students from seoul national and yonsei universities were en 
route to the south bank of the imjin river near the border to attend 
a prayer rally for national reunification 
about 2000 police were on the highway between seoul and the 
river and set up several checkpoints in the effort to keep radical 
students away from the river the northernmost point to which south 
koreans are permitted to travel the demilitarized zone between the 
koreas is several miles to the north 
police turned away scores of students who tried to board trains 
at several railway stations in seoul 
the government banned the riverside rally which the students 
intended as as a warmup for a proposed northsouth meeting of 
student leaders in the panmunjom border village friday to discuss 
reunficiation and a joint olympics 
north korea says it will boycott the games scheduled for 
september in seoul because its demand to be cohost was rejected 
radical students in the south say making south korea the only 
host will perpetuate partition of the peninsula which has been 
divided since 1945 
president roh taewoos government has forbidden the northsouth 
student meeting and says anyone disobeying the order will be 
arrested the planned march to panmunjom is considered a serious 
challenge to the government position that it should be the sole 
channel for contact with north korea 
officials say the student talks would harm the national interest 
and give the north a propaganda advantage 
on saturday four students were arrested while trying to force 
their way through the main gate of us army headquarters in seoul 
to seek permission from gen louis menetrey the american commander 
for the march to panmunjon 
the un command led by the united states and its korean war 
allies controls the southern half of the truce village and north 
korea controls the northern half 
a us military spokesman told them only the south korean 
government could grant permission the four were among 13 
representatives chosen by radical student leaders saturday to 
represent the south at the meeting with students from the north 
they and another student were charged monday with violating the 
national security law police said they were looking for the other 
delegates to the panmunjom meeting and about 30 other students 
suspected of organizing it 
young radicals recently have adopted a strong antiamerican tone 
claiming the 42000 american troops in south korea delay 
reunification and demanding they be withdrawn the soldiers are here 
under a mutual defense pact the governments have maintained since 
the korean war of 195053

work begins tuesday on refloating the ferry ellis 
island which carried 12 million immigrants to manhattan and new 
jersey but now is a hazard 
our principal concern is that the structure is a navigational 
hazard and we have to move it because of that edie sheanhammond 
a spokeswoman for the national park service said monday from her 
office in boston 
although the vessel has been a hazard since it sank in 1968 the 
park service is opening a museum on ellis island next year and the 
channel must be dredged for newer ferries mrs sheanhammond said 
the ferry sitting in new york harbor also has historical 
significance once raised it will be taken to another part of the 
island and studied mrs sheanhammond said 
it was the ride to freedom for them it was their hope for the 
future for them she said 
when the project was proposed private contractors bidding for 
the salvage offered costly estimates for what they said might be an 
impossible job raising the vessel in one piece but the us navy 
is going to do the job free 
on tuesday a naval reserve unit from chicago will arrive and 
begin setting up for an initial dive wednesday the divers will work 
through june 16 removing silt and patching a few small holes in the 
hull other reserve units will work through the summer 
the doubledecked ferry began service in 1904 for what was then 
the bureau of immigration the 160foot long vessel could carry 
1000 immigrants in its hold and about 25 officials and new york 
visitors on the top it was outfitted with a 12bed hospital 
it made its last run in 1954 and was docked at ellis island until 
it sank on aug 11 1968 after years of sitting in the water 
without attention

an assistance program designed to bring 
telephone service to poor americans signed up nearly 14000 new 
subscribers in four target areas in the first six months of the 
program though a government report shows phone subscribership in 
three of those areas declined overall 
the program called link up america is a combined initiative 
of state and federal regulators consumer groups and telephone 
companies to bring phone service to the 5 million americans who 
dont have it 
since it was started last october 30 states and the district of 
columbia have developed programs certified by the federal 
communications commission residents of those states become eligible 
for benefits that include payment of up to half of their phone 
installation and connection charges up to 30 
the district of columbia and three states arkansas texas and 
west virginia were selected as target states to be monitored 
closely for six months so the fcc could assess the effectiveness of 
various marketing strategies that could be used in other areas 
link up america officials say the program signed up 5358 new 
subscribers in arkansas 455 in the district of columbia 5153 in 
texas and 3029 in west virginia 
a census bureau survey for the fcc shows that subscribership 
declined from march 1987 to march 1988 in arkansas from 87 percent 
to 836 percent of the population in texas from 904 percent to 
878 percent and in west virginia from 887 percent to 879 
percent in washington dc subscribership rose from 912 percent 
to 933 percent 
fcc spokesman john kamp said economic conditions in the three 
states probably accounted for the overall decline in subscribership 
these three states are economically in bad shape that even 
with this program the penetration would go down is not too 
surprising to us he said

a central american airlines jet took off from 
a world war ii auxiliary landing strip monday and completed the 
final 12 miles of a trip cut short two weeks ago by engine failure 
and an emergency landing in a thunderstorm 
the boeing 737 landed successfully without power may 24 without 
injuries to the 41 people aboard 
mondays takeoff was normal in all respects said warren v 
wandel a safety inspector for the national transportation safety 
board 
actually the fast steep ascent would have been a bit 
uncomfortable for passengers had there been any aboard 
the two boeing test pilots who flew the plane from its emergency 
landing strip to new orleans international airport practically stood 
the plane on its tail made a 15degree turn to the right and 
climbed quickly into low clouds lingering from two days of rain 
the plane landed safely at new orleans international about 15 
minutes later 
the narrow world war ii airstrip is now used as a road from a 
fuel tank assembly plant to a harbor on the intracoastal waterway a 
straightline shortcut from the gulf of mexico to the port at new 
orleans 
the may 24 emergency landing was made on a grassy strip parallel 
to the road 
the plane had lost power in both engines and the right one 
which showed some damage from overheating was replaced for takeoff 
wandel said the left engine would be removed at new orleans 
international and both engines would be taken apart next week and 
inspected 
of all the possible causes of the loss of power only fuel 
contamination has been ruled out wandel said it will be several 
months before the ntsb announces its findings he said 
getting approval to remove the plane from the insurers and all 
the federal state and local agencies involved was cumbersome there 
were discussions of taking the plane apart and trucking the pieces 
away as well as putting it aboard a barge and floating it to an 
airport 
it is owned by taca a central american airline based in el 
salvador with offices in new orleans

a prosecutor on monday promised a 
full probe of the borken mine explosion and a national television 
network said he was looking into whether a flame from a cigarette 
lighter sparked the disaster 
rescue workers early monday found the body of another miner 
bringing the number of confirmed dead to 46 
mine owners again defended the rescue operation following the 
disclosure that radio contact was made with six miners hours after 
the blast but then cut off when a radio operator told them to stop 
sending signals 
the owners of the mine acknowledged sunday that a radio operator 
told the six miners to stop sending messages believing they were 
another search team 
heinz cramer a technical director for preussen elekta the 
company that owns the mine said monday that failure to recognize 
the sound two hammers banged together by the survivors as a sign 
of life had not diminished the rescue effort 
we knew that the area where the men were found presented the 
best possibility of finding survivors and thats where we began 
drilling cramer said 
the six were discovered alive on saturday after officials 
insisted there was no sign of life in the coal mine where 57 men had 
been trapped since wednesday 
prosecutors are investigating whether an open flame may have 
ignited the gas explosion in the stolzenbach mine in this town 72 
miles northeast of frankfurt the zdf television network reported 
monday 
the television said cigarette lighters were found inside the 
mine but mine officials say there are strict regulations against 
smoking underground 
the six surviving miners had used lighters to test for the 
presence of the deadly carbon monoxide an odorless and invisible 
gas that burns with a paleblue flame when ignited 
they survived by finding an air pocket in a part of the mine free 
of the gas 
high concentrations of carbon monoxide slowed the agonizing 
search for the last five men still missing in the depths of the 
shaft officials said rescuers were forced to repeatedly renew their 
oxygen supplies 
authorities said that because of the gas fumes there was little 
chance that the missing miners would be found alive 
more details emerged about the harrowing ordeal of the survivors 
ahmet batkan the turkish immigrant among them was quoted as 
saying the men had tried to pull a seriously injured comrade to the 
air pocket but the man reportedly along the way 
he died in my arms batkan was quoted as saying in the bild 
newspaper 
prosecutor stephan walcher in the nearby city of kassel said a 
full investigation had been launched into the cause of the disaster 
we will review all of the information being collected to 
determine what caused the accident and whether there are grounds for 
any criminal prosecution walcher told reporters at a news 
conference at the mine 
officials have said the mine was regularly inspected and that all 
government safety regulations were followed 
erwin braun head of the coal administration board in kassel 
said an explosion of such ferocity had never been recorded in the 
region 
he praised the rescue efforts 
news about last wednesdays radio contact with the six survivors 
has sparked intense media criticism of the rescue operation 
the survivors were found after their signals were picked up by a 
television crews microphone which had been lowered into a shaft 
500 feet beneath the earth 
a police spokesman in the nearby town of dillich who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said a communications center set up after 
the accident received a flood of calls from people offering to help 
in the rescue efforts 
he said some of the callers claimed they had seen where the 
miners were trapped in their dreams 
we tell the people well call them back if they are needed 
the police spokesman said so far the rescue center has not asked

in another sign of improving economic 
conditions the number of americans late on their mortgage payments 
fell to the second lowest level of this decade during the first 
three months of the year a trade group of lenders reported monday 
the mortgage bankers association said the number of mortgage 
payments late by 30 days or more dropped to 478 percent of total 
mortgages in the first quarter down from 495 percent in the last 
three months of 1987 
this was the second lowest latepayment level since 1979 
bettered only by a 471 percent deliquency rate in the third quarter 
of 1987 
the rate of foreclosures remained unchanged in the first quarter 
at 027 percent of all mortgages up slightly from the rate a year 
ago 
warren lasko executive vice president of the association said 
foreclosures remain a problem especially in economically 
depressed regions of the country but he said the steady drop in 
late payments should translate into lower foreclosures in quarters 
ahead 
all four regions of the country experienced lower latepayment 
levels in the first quarter when compared with the same period a 
year ago when the overall latepayment rate was 517 percent 
the largest decline was in the northeast where late payments 
fell from 444 percent a year ago to 381 percent in the 
januarymarch quarter the lowest level of any region 
the south which has been hard hit by troubles in energy 
producing states saw the level of late payments fall from 572 
percent down to 527 percent in the januarymarch quarter 
the midwest had a drop from 522 percent to 485 percent while 
the level of late payments in the west fell from 451 percent down 
to 417 percent in the first quarter

the key to any conservative success in this weeks 
runoff for the national assembly is in the extremeright national 
front after a surprisingly strong showing by the rightists in round 
no 1 
after president francois mitterrands reelection last month with 
a hefty 54 percent of the vote the polls analysts and most 
politicians expected a socialist tidal wave in sundays voting for 
the 577seat national assembly 
but the right and centerright parties ran even with the 
socialists in popular vote 
as the support is distributed however the socialists have an 
edge to win a majority of seats 
but a foregone conclusion suddenly became a horse race and on 
monday the most sought after people in france were the 345 percent 
of voters who didnt cast ballots sunday 
some analysts said the voters indicated they wanted a balance of 
power between the right and left such as the cohabitation that 
existed between the socialist mitterrand and the conservatives who 
won control of the national assembly in the 1986 elections 
two important factors affect the june 12 runoff one is how many 
of the registered voters who didnt go to the polls sunday can be 
persuaded to vote 
turnout in the first round was the lowest for any election in 
postwar france 
the level of abstentions has created suspense for the second 
round and unexpectedly invigorated the campaign wrote the leftist 
daily liberation this will not exactly be the pleasure cruise 
predicted by the polls 
the other factor is strategic withdrawal 
in districts where no candidate won a majority all those with 
125 percent or more were eligible for the runoff which depending 
on the constituency could involve several candidates 
in the past to set up a direct rightleft confrontation the 
communists and socialists have agreed to back the bestplaced 
leftist candidate the traditional rightist parties did the same 
this time while the socialists and communists will implement the 
withdrawal strategy the question remains about what the national 
front will do 
the conservative rally for the republic and centerright union 
for french democracy fielded a single candidate in each district in 
districts where the national front candidate qualified for the 
runoff along with the joint rprudf candidate he could split the 
rightist vote and effectively elect a socialist or communist 
national front leader jeanmarie le pen said he was ready to help 
defeat the socialists by withdrawing his candidates in favor of 
leading rprudf candidates but only if the rpr and udf did the same 
in constituencies where national front candidates were leading 
alain juppe former spokesman for the outgoing conservative 
government said the rprudf coalition maintained its refusal to 
deal with the national front but would appeal directly to its voters 
to help defeat the left 
strategy meetings were going on at major party headquarters all 
over paris on monday 
the french must confirm their will not to confide all power in 
our country to a single party and you and me we must work toward 
that this week said former president valery giscard destaing 
interior minister pierre joxe said it was reasonable to think 
that socialist premier michel rocards government may be able to 
count on a parliamentary majority 
in popular vote the rprudf candidates won 3767 percent of the 
vote while the socialists and their allies won 3755 the 
communists scored 1132 percent and the national front 965 percent 
the rest went to minor parties 
in actual seats the rprudf candidates won 76 seats in the first 
round the socialists 40 minor rightists three the communists one 
and the national front none but the socialists were in better 
position to win a majority of the 455 seats being decided in the 
runoff

president reagan said monday that while the 
moscow summit produced important additional strides toward a 
strategic arms treaty we still dont know when it can be 
achieved 
in a postsummit assessment of his talks with soviet general 
secretary mikhail s gorbachev reagan acknowledged that completion 
of the lessambitious intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf 
treaty was the event that held perhaps the most immediate historic 
importance 
reagan looked rested and refreshed after a quiet weekend at the 
white house and spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president 
feels very good in fact frisky 
the 77yearold chief executive had seemed fatigued at times last 
week and he spoke in a hoarse voice during an address in london on 
friday the day after the summit ended 
in his speech monday to the world gas conference reagan said 
the significance of this inf treaty can hardly be overstated 
these missiles will not simply have been shuffled around on the 
map or placed in storage they will have been destroyed he said 
although the two sides remained far apart on many matters 
involving a strategic arms reduction or start treaty slashing up 
to 50 percent of the us and soviet stockpiles of the most 
dangerous missiles in their arsenals reagan did say that he and 
gorbachev had made progress 
gorbachev had voiced disappointment in moscow that the talks did 
not move further lamenting missed opportunities 
among other things the two sides failed to narrow differences 
over the inclusion of sealaunched cruise missiles in such a treaty 
at the outset of his speech to the members of natural gas 
associations from some 45 countries reagan noted the presence of 
soviet delegates 
if youre wondering about the weather back in moscow he 
said well lately most of the days have been sunny and mild 
reagan reviewed the progression of arms reduction talks he and 
gorbachev had in geneva iceland and washington he said the united 
states strives to accomplish comprehensive verification 
provisions for a strategic arms accord building on those in 
the inf pact 
in moscow we made made important additional strides toward 
that objective he said but he also noted that verification in 
particular represents one of the most important and difficult 
issues 
when will the start treaty be completed we still do not 
know the president said but i can say to you were moving 
forward on the treaty and its associated documents with renewed 
vigor and cooperation i wont set deadlines 
us and soviet armscontrol negotiators in geneva are in recess 
this month and neither side has committed to a fifth 
reagangorbachev summit before the presidents term ends next 
january 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said it would be 
unwise to rush negotiations on start and i compliment the president 
on the position that he has taken also in that regard 
headlinegrabbing summits are one thing but rushing to meet a 
deadline on a treaty as important as start would be irresponsible 
byrd said in a speech on the senate floor 
now may be a good time to reduce the fanfare of the summit and 
let the negotiators do their important work in quiet said byrd 
further with a change in presidents on the horizon i do not 
believe it would be wise to lock the next president into a hasty 
agreement be he a republican or a democrat 
much of reagans speech was studded with the kinds of personal 
remembrances and anecdotes that marked his earlier comments about 
the moscow experience 
he said his greatest moscow triumph came not in the facetoface 
talks with gorbachev inside the kremlin walls but in the words of 
faith words of freedom words of truth that he relayed to the 
soviet people 
it made me feel humble thats the only way you could feel it 
made me think that visiting moscow on behalf of the american people 
was one of the highest privileges of my life reagan said 
in his third such upbeat assessement of the summit within four 
days reagan said came away with an impression of change an 
impression of new possibilities of new hope during his fiveday 
visit to a land undergoing revolutionary change with gorbachevs 
policies of glasnost and perestroika or openness and 
restructuring 
the president said he was encouraged by his meetings with 
gorbachev on arms control regional and bilateral matters and human 
rights and he noted that hed been able to reach out to the soviet 
people by meeting with dissidents refuseniks and russian orthodox 
monks 
he also recounted that according to one newspaper report an 
elderly woman whod seen his stroll about a moscow street was quoted 
as saying i like it that he says god bless you 
there perhaps lies the greatest significance of what took place 
in moscow last week not that ronald reagan spoke there he said 
i was only giving voice to the abiding beliefs of the american 
people indeed of free people everywhere 
no it was that the words that were spoken were words of faith 
words of freedom words of truth reagan said unarmed truth is 
irresistable

gaps in insurance coverage a dearth of 
longterm care and lack of services for the poor are among the most 
pressing problems facing aids patients health professionals said 
monday 
our biggest problems are acute care for indigent aids patients 
and longterm custodial care katherine wright a care coordinator 
at the aids arms network in dallas told a senate committee 
wright said many aids patients die in the hospital because their 
insurance does not cover home care hospices are unavailable or 
nursing homes will not accept them 
she also cited gaps in the private and government insurance 
systems and said more than half the clients her organization sees 
spend themselves down to the poverty level to qualify for help from 
the statefederal medicaid program 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the government affairs 
committee said the number of fullblown aids cases in the united 
states is expected to reach 450000 by 1993 
we must take steps now to meet the challenges presented by the 
tremendous increase in aids cases that is upon us he said 
glenn cited two recent reports recommending increased federal 
funding and involvement in the aids crisis one from the institute 
of medicine and the other from the chairman of the presidential 
commission on aids 
dr david sundwall adminstrator of the federal health resources 
and services administration said his agency is spending nearly 37 
million on aids grant programs this year and is requesting 40 
million for fiscal 1989 
he declined to say more money is needed but acknowledged that his 
agency receives about twice as many grant proposals as it can fund 
he also said some services fall short 
in order to to cope with the inevitable increasing burden 
were going to have to have better longterm care sundwall said 
sundwall said people are backed up in hospital beds in many 
regions because they dont have anywhere else to go he said the 
crunch is regional and his agency is considering numerous 
strategies among them block grants to states based on their number 
of aids cases 
ideally a comprehensive aids service delivery network would 
include hospital services outpatient physician or clinic services 
home health care subacute skilled nursing inhome support 
services mental health services and counseling housing 
employment legal and financial services sundwall said 
dr june osborn dean of the school of public health at the 
university of michigan said communities need to realistically 
assess whether they have enough hospital beds to accomodate the 
expected surge in aids patients and there should be provision made 
for outpatient care 
osborn also said the nursing shortage poses an ominous threat 
in some areas and she warned that planning is needed to ensure that 
new and experimental aids therapies are available on a equitable 
basis as well as to avoid disastrous competition in hospital 
pharmacy budgets with drugs for other groups of patients 
all of these issues and many more command attention she said 
in her testimony we have an urgent agenda

congress should reinstate the presidents power 
to impound appropriated money as a way of bringing the federal 
budget deficit under control former president gerald ford said 
monday 
the budget process is in total shambles ford said in a 
speech at the national press club 
the power of impoundment was ended in 1974 when congress moved 
to streamline the budget process 
using impoundment a president could sign an appropriations bill 
yet refuse to spend part of the money in what ford called an 
important tool of fiscal responsibility 
the antiimpoundment provisions in my opinion have been a 
disaster ford said the present system is no substitute for 
strong action by the president of the united states he said 
if we are irresponsible if we blow it there is no doubt in my 
mind that we are gambling with the health and security of the united 
states he said 
allowing presidents to impound money would be a quick solution to 
the present budget difficulties since reinstating the process would 
require only legislation rather than a constitutional amendment 
ford said 
ford on monday unveiled his portrait at the smithsonian 
institutions hall of the presidents the first presidential 
portrait painted explicitly for the collection 
the portrait shows ford dressed in a dark pinstriped suit 
standing in a halflength pose his right hand on his hip it was 
painted by everett raymond kinstler 
it will be on permanent exhibit in the hall of the presidents 
which shows likenesses of every president from george washington to 
ronald reagan 
ford was the house republican leader when he was appointed vice 
president in 1973 after spiro agnew resigned from the office 
ford became president the next year with the resignation of 
richard nixon thus becoming the first us president that had never 
won a national election 
the portrait was painted after ford left office in 1980 it was a 
gift of the gerald r ford foundation of grand rapids mich which 
operates a museum and library dedicated to fords term in office 
kinstler painted the official white house portraits of both nixon 
and ford

john corcoran graduated from high school got 
a college degree taught school and made millions in real estate 
development while living a deception he couldnt read 
it all came undone when a drop in business forced him to fire the 
people who did his reading and return to the classroom this time as 
a student 
its a national crisis it cant be put on the back burner any 
longer corcoran said in a telephone interview monday this 
isnt something like drugs or aids this is something we can do 
something about 
corcoran a resident of oceanside came to the city over the 
weekend to promote project literacy la an effort to make other 
people aware of the slavery of illiteracy in america 
theres a chaos that goes on when youre illiterate in 
america he said theres a world out there that functions with 
the written word and you dont know that all you can do is orally 
communicate 
he learned to read after enrolling in the carlsbad city library 
adult learning program in september 1986 studying and sounding out 
words 40 to 50 hours a week for more than 14 months 
on sunday corcoran demonstrated his new skills by reading during 
services at the first congregational church of los angeles 
theres a real desire in me to do everything i can to try to 
make other people aware of the slavery of illiteracy in america 
he said we have a problem that we can solve that means reform 
it means change 
corcoran now 50 said he attended many schools as a youngster 
because his parents changed jobs often he was never at one school 
long enough for teachers to realize he couldnt read 
if you tell somebody you cant read youre telling someone 
youre dumb he said i couldnt really reach out for help 
to compensate corcoran said he made friends with people who had 
good vocabularies and he used a lot of analogies and metaphors when 
he spoke he said his wife kathy was the only one who knew about his 
illiteracy 
he received a bachelors degree in education from texas western 
college now university of texas at el paso where he was the 
captain of the basketball team 
corcoran won national science foundation grants to study in 
graduate schools at san diego state louisiana state university and 
university of santa clara 
he said he avoided reading by misbehaving in grade school and in 
high school he cheated on tests by preparing answers beforehand or 
refusing to turn in tests 
in college he faked or cheated his way through general education 
courses then chose classes where takehome tests were assigned or 
accounting classes where tests involved numbers which gave him no 
trouble 
as a teacher he said he relied on students in his social 
studies business and math classes to call roll and to read to the 
others 
everything was oral he said i taught to them the modes i 
learned by 
corcoran said he went into the real estate development business 
while he was teaching and eventually became the owner of a 
multimilliondollar company secretaries accountants bookkeepers 
and lawyers surrounded him and did all of his reading and writing 
corcoran said the loss of his employees in 1986 combined with 
public service announcements he saw on television prompted him to 
seek help 
illiteracy is common among people at every level and it may be 
more difficult for people with corcorans success to come forward 
and admit the problem said lynda jones program coordinator for the 
carlsbad librarys adult learning program 
in daily life theyre probably dealing with more stress because 
theyre dealing with people who dont know she said they want 
to be sure that no one is going to see them 
corcoran took part in a literacy symposium in washington dc 
and has made a dozen trips around the country promoting literacy 
and said he is writing a book to tell his story

the supreme court on monday provided a victory 
for women seeking financial support for their illegitimate children 
and the court also expanded its study of drug testing in the 
american workplace 
in a unanimous decision the justices ruled as unconstitutional a 
pennsylvania law that had said the mother of an illegitimate child 
must sue the alleged father for support within six years of the 
childs birth 
the decision hinted that the court might frown on state laws 
preventing mothers from suing on behalf of any minor child in 
effect requiring an 18year deadline for paternity suits 
congress called for such 18year deadlines in the child support 
enforcement amendments of 1984 but the justices passed up the chance 
of ruling whether the federal law is binding on the states 
instead justice sandra day oconnor wrote for the court that 
pennsylvanias former sixyear deadline violated equalprotection 
rights the states law always had let legitimate children sue for 
parental support any time before their 18th birthdays 
diane dodson a lawyer with the womens legal defense fund said 
the ruling represents a second chance for thousands of children 
who were once barred from collecting child support because they 
waited too long to establish paternity 
about 15 million illegitimate children in the united states 
receive no financial support from one parent and ms dodson said as 
many as 400000 might be affected by mondays ruling 
anyone who had been told she waited too long to take her 
childrens father to court to collect child support may be able to 
reopen the matter so long as the children still are under age 18 
she said 
the decision reinstated cherlyn clarks 1983 lawsuit against gene 
jeter for support of her daughter tiffany who was born in 
pittsburgh in 1973 
in a separate action the court said it will decide whether the 
nations railroads may require all employees involved in serious 
accidents to take tests designed to detect alcohol and drug use 
the court agreed to review a feb 11 ruling by the san 
franciscobased 9th us circuit court of appeals that such tests 
conducted by private employers acting for the government are 
unreasonable searches banned by the constitutions fourth amendment 
the railroad drugtesting case stems from regulations issued by 
the federal railroad administration in 1985 to alleviate a 
significant safety problem caused by alcohol and drug use by rail 
employees 
the justices last february said they would decide whether the 
us customs service may conduct drug tests for those seeking 
drugenforcement jobs a federal appeals court condoned such testing 
on monday the justices said they will study the customs service 
and railroad employees cases together a decision is expected 
sometime in 1989 
transportation secretary jim burnley welcomed the courts review 
of the railroad drug tests and predicted the justices would permit

the governments exportimport bank said monday 
it was resuming lending to nigeria africas most populous country 
after it cleared up overdue payments on 388 million in outstanding 
loans 
nigeria is a major exporter of oil to this country 
the bank which makes loans to encourage us exports will lend 
nigerian borrowers as much as 10 million on each export agreement 
repayment must be completed in five years loans for larger projects 
will be considered if the money goes to different borrowers 
the bank has been unwilling to lend to nigeria since 1985 the 
change was made possible by new policies that the government of gen 
ibrahim babangida has undertaken the bank said but the bank still 
is unwilling to make longterm loans which also were cut off in 
1985 
nigeria is one of the third worlds largest debtors with about 
27 billion outstanding according to the world bank like big 
debtors in latin america and unlike most african countries nigeria 
owes most of its debt about 55 percent to commercial banks 
rather than to governments 
we applaud the government of nigerias efforts to regain 
economic balance and endorse their continuing movement toward 
economic reform bank president john a bohn jr said in 
announcing its new policy 
he said it would continue to watch nigerias economic progress 
and that the us loans will help nigeria buy the machines and 
services it needs to restore growth 
nigeria has been hard hit by the drop in the price of oil its 
major export the world bank calculates that the income of the 
average nigerian there are more than 103 million of them dropped 
to 640 in 1986 from 820 the year before 
bohn praised the nigerian governments efforts to work with the 
world bank and the international monetary fund on their advice 
nigeria recently increased domestic prices of gasoline and diesel 
fuel in an effort to reduce its 15 billion budget deficit 
the increase touched off a twoweek strike that paralyzed medical 
and banking services and brought on demonstrations in which at least 
six people were killed the strike ended last month

democrat michael dukakis of massachusetts

this point than to be 10 percent ahead ford said in an appearance 
at the national press club it is better to be a little behind 
so you can have a much more aggressive and affirmative campaign 
the presidential election likely will be decided like others

george p shultz carried his faltering 
campaign for arabisraeli peace to syria and told reporters monday 
the united states and soviet union will continue discussions on a 
middle east settlement 
the us secretary of state spent about four hours in damascus 
half of it in meetings with president hafez assad who has taken a 
hard line on peace with israel 
he then came egypt where he toured ancient luxor and scheduled a 
meeting tuesday with president hosni mubarak before ending his 
fourth middle east mission of the year 
shultz briefed assad on last weeks ussoviet summit in moscow 
and after a discussion of an increase in international terrorism 
offered to share information with him about the problem a senior 
us official said monday 
shultz then flew to luxor at the site of the ancient nileside 
egyptian capital thebes 420 miles south of cairo and toured the 
tombs of the pharaohs 
dressed in a blue golf cap and a green sports shirt he seemed 
relaxed after 3 days of tough diplomacy with the leaders of israel 
jordan and syria 
the tombs and the majestic temple column of karnak the national 
shrine of ancient egypt are reached by crossing the nile by ferry 
egyptian frogmen and armed partol boats kept watch over the 
secretary and his delegation 
shultzs meeting with assad reflected continuing improvement in 
us relations with a country the state department still lists as a 
supporter of terrorism 
speaking to arab reporters afterward he said the united states 
and soviet union have agreed to continue to address ourselves to 
the middle east issues 
we will have some continuing discussions probably before long 
on an intensive basis shultz said its not for the soviet 
union and the united states to resolve the problems here its for 
the countries in the region to resolve their problems 
he added however that the superpowers have a certain amount 
of influence and if we see some things in a parallel way it will 
probably make an impact 
washington has dropped its opposition to a soviet role in a 
middle east peace conference but objects to an active part for 
outside powers in negotiations between israel and its arab foes 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel opposes any soviet role 
but plans to meet the soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze at the united nations it will be the latest of 
several recent contacts between the two countries which do not have 
formal diplomatic relations 
shultz has been unable to bridge the gap between israel and the 
arabs over the us peace proposals which include an international 
conference and trading israelioccupied land for peace 
king hussein of jordan said saturday that israeli withdrawal from 
occupied territories is a condition for talks shamir opposes 
condition and has balked at shultzs insistence on at least a 
partial israeli pullback 
in comments to the arab reporters shultz said both sides could 
work with his proposal if people will cast aside their extreme 
views their illusions and operate on the basis of reality 
the secretary said he considers the arab demand for an 
independent palestinian nation unworkable and suggested a 
confederation or an attachment to another state he said it could 
be similar to an american state or a swiss canton 
about lebanon shultz said he believed it important that 
presidential elections go ahead as planned even if there is no 
solution to the countrys constitutional crisis 
us officials have welcomed syrias military role in lebanons 
moslem areas and have worked with syria in trying to win christian 
political concessions that might help calm the 13yearold sectarian 
civil war 
there has been no sign however that the lebanese forces the 
main christian militia will accept any plan ending christian 
political dominance in a country that now has a moslem majority

some supporters of jesse jackson complained 
monday that the democratic presidential contender will be denied his 
fair share of delegates in new jerseys primary election on tuesday 
were fighting for essentially a moral principle said 
frank watkins jacksons national political director 
newark mayor sharpe james jacksons state campaign chairman 
said new jerseys winnertakeall delegate apportionment will 
leave jackson with fewer delegates than he deserves 
james and some others in the jackson camp demanded that 
democratic party leaders give jackson a large portion perhaps all 
of the atlarge new jersey delegates those delegates are 
expected to go mainly to democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
james accused party leaders including sen bill bradley a 
dukakis backer of refusing to return telephone calls to discuss 
the dispute 
the jackson backers said if the matter isnt settled by tuesday 
they would take their complaints to the partys national convention 
next month in atlanta 
were calling for fairness we are prepared to go all the way 
to atlanta with this fight said james 
under state party rules voters will elect 71 pledged delegates 
tuesday from 20 specially created delegate districts then party 
leaders will meet june 26 to pick an additional 38 atlarge 
delegates pledged in proportion to the elected delegates the state 
has nine super delegates who are state members of the 
democratic national committee 
jackson backers claim the delegate districts have been drawn 
unfairly diluting urban populations where jackson is strong 
with suburbs where he is weaker 
the jackson supporters also criticized the winnertakeall 
system whereby candidates will win all of districts delegates if 
they win anything above 50 percent of the votes cast 
james said jackson could get 49 percent of the votes cast and 
yet end up with only a handful of delegates he called the process 
unfair constitutional

the reagan administration notified congress on 
monday it had approved a 486 million arms sale to japan involving 
the us navys most sophisticated shipboard air defense system 
the pentagon in a series of announcements also notified 
congress of additional arms sale plans involving south korea greece 
and turkey those deals will total about 200 million 
assuming congressional approval japan will be allowed to buy the 
complete package of radars vertical launching systems for missiles 
satellite positioning gear and phalanx antimissile guns needed to 
build its own aegis airdefense ship the pentagon said 
installation of aegis on a ship of the japanese maritime 
selfdefense force will enhance japanese capability to protect its 
sea lines of communication the pentagon said 
it is in us national interests to assist japan in meeting 
these goals 
the proposed sale of the aegis combat system generated opposition 
in the house earlier this year with a small group of lawmakers 
complaining about japans trade policies and expressing concern that 
japan might not keep the technology secret 
that opposition has evaporated in recent weeks however and the 
deal is now expected to win congressional blessing defense 
secretary frank c carlucci and other top pentagon officials have 
argued that theunited states should not withhold advanced military 
technology at a time when it is pressing japan and other allies to 
spend more on defense 
the aegis combat system was developed by the united states for 
its newest line of cruisers the socalled ticonderoga class but it 
also is to be used on its next line of destroyers 
japan intends to fit the combat system to a destroyer 
the ticonderogaclass cruisers are considered the most 
sophisticated airdefense ships in the world featuring a unique 
wraparound radar system that allows the vessel to see in all 
directions at once the vessels also carry a large computer system 
that allows the simultaneous tracking of hundreds of targets while 
controlling defensive missiles and other weapons 
the pentagon said the prime contractor for the aegis sale would 
be the rca corps electronic systems division in moorestown nj 
and that the navy would oversee the transaction 
implementation of this sale will require the assignment of 44 
us contractor representatives to japan for approximately three 
years the pentagon added 
the other arms transactions meantime involve the sale of 
harpoon antiship missiles to south korea spare parts and training 
services to greece to help support three f4 phantom jet fighter 
squadrons and components and subassemblies for 15 uh1h huey 
transport helicopters that will be assembled in turkey 
the pentagon said the deal with south korea would involve 52 of 
the missiles and be worth an estimated 78 million the deal with 
greece will be worth an estimated 87 million and the deal with 
turkey an estimated 35 million

president francois mitterrand inaugurated a 
museum devoted to peace monday at the site of one of the worlds 
great battles and said he hoped it would help unify europe 
flanked by dignitaries mitterrand marked the 44th anniversary of 
the dday invasion of normandy by calling on world leaders to be 
masters of our history united frustrating a resurgence of the 
forces of intolerance and oppression 
he said the museum was intended to emphasize that unity is 
essential to peace 
peace will be based not only on the superpowers but also on a 
strong independent europe he said 
among those at the ceremony were the first german delegation to 
attend a dday anniversary and a multinational group of 160 
schoolchildren 
three million men fought in the 76day battle of normandy that 
began june 6 1944 and 367000 were killed or wounded victory for 
the allies forced the germans into retreat and marked a turning 
point in the war 
the glassandwhitestone structure stands on a bluff in a suburb 
of caen atop a bunker used as a german division headquarters during 
the allied invasion fractured granite lines the narrow entrance to 
the spacious main hall 
caen in the british sector of the invasion front was among the 
many normandy cities leveled the museum was the idea of mayor 
jeanmarie girault who called it the crowning achievement of the 
citys reconstruction 
it contains a collection of war relics including a british 
bomber german tanks old rifles and uniforms the six exhibits 
assembled by a team of top french historians seek to explain the 
causes of the war rather than glorify its battles 
world war ii was the first great war fought over political 
ideology museum organizers said 
although we were fighting battles over real estate the war was 
really about ideological matters said us rep sam gibbons a 
florida democrat and member of the american delegation to the 
ceremony 
gibbons a captain in the 501st parachute infantry dropped 
behind german lines during the invasion he is the only normandy 
veteran in congress 
historians of the french institute for the history of the 
present who developed the exhibits said they were intended to 
balance the traditional depiction of various phases of the war in 
french textbooks 
textbooks tend to glorify the resistance while skirting the role 
played by the vichy regime collaborators and the foreign troops who 
freed france historian denis peschanski said 
the idea of this museum is to give cause for reflection rather 
than to make the traditional arguments and appeals to emotional 
response he said 
along with british canadian and american regular armies the 
normandy invasion force included soldiers from czechoslovakia 
poland norway greece the netherlands belgium luxembourg and 
france 
delegations from italy the soviet union and japan also were 
present monday including yoshitaka kawamato director of the peace 
museum at hiroshima japan site of the first nuclear bombing

the senate voted 5431 monday against requiring 
president reagan to invoke the war powers act and defend his persian 
gulf policy against the restrictions of the 1973 law 
the vote by the democraticcontrolled chamber was the latest in a 
long series of inconclusive fights over whether the act applies to 
reagans 11month policy of protecting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
the war powers law restricts a presidents right to send us 
military personnel to areas of imminent hostilities and would 
under some circumstances require the personnel to be withdrawn 
within 60 days or 90 days 
reagan as have all his predecessors argues that the law is an 
unconstitutional restriction 
sen brock adams dwash pushed for consideration of the war 
powers issue telling his colleagues that despite the constitutional 
questions the law should be followed until it is struck down or 
changed 
the question is simple said adams are we going to 
recognize the facts and vote to uphold the law or are we going to 
continue to abrogate our constitutional responsibility 
mondays vote was on the question of whether to consider adams 
war powers resolution as the pending business his resolution would 
require the law be invoked 
sen john warner rva noted that reagans policy recently has 
been extended from the reflagged kuwaiti tankers to a policy of 
protecting neutral shipping in the wartorn area 
this is a very inopporturne time for this issue to be reopened 
in terms of what were trying to do in the gulf warner said 
that situation seems to be becoming more stable 
adams and other critics of reagans policy suggested that the 
united states may be drawn into the long iraniraq conflict 
there have been four different instances in which the reflagged 
kuwaiti tankers or us navy warships have been involved in military 
action with iran the most recent occurred april 18 when navy 
planes and ships sank or damaged six iranian vessels 
this is an incredibly dangerous policy when youre on the edge 
of a very dangerous war adams said 
but sen john mccain rariz defended the policy saying that 
under international law it is not an act of war to come to the aid 
of neutral ships who seek help he said that as a result of the 
united states firm action we have seen a cessation of iranian 
activity 
sen lowell weicker rconn noted that the senate has been 
unable to agree on whether the war powers act applies there seems 
to be the inability by congress to stand up to presidents he 
added 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva and other democratic 
leaders along with warner last month introduced a bill that would 
overhaul the war powers act their measure would eliminate the 
requirement for a withdrawal after 60 days 
byrd was critical of reagans gulf plans but said they shouldnt 
be changed now the policy of escorting of convoying kuwaiti 
ships is not a good one but thats the policy were following 
at the same time byrd was also critical of the war powers act 
it is an unworkable law he said because it robs the 
president of credibility of flexibility if he promises troops and 
the senate later requires their withdrawal 
but sen mark hatfield rore said the issue was clear the 
law should be followed we have postured and debated and 
filibustered into the early hours but we have not done one single 
thing to uphold the constitution

opposition leaders on monday called on 
latin american leaders to mediate efforts to push gen manuel 
antonio noriega from power 
little indication emerged here however that noriega is willing 
to permit any kind of mediation that would ease him out of his 
control of the military and government he has survived internal 
protests as well as substantial us pressure 
opposition leaders told morton abramowitz the deputy us 
secretary of state who met with them during the weekend that they 
favor mediation by current not past latin american presidents 
former presidents carlos andres perez of venezuela and daniel 
oduber of costa rica met last week with panamanas acting chief 
executive manuel solis palma but the governmentcontrolled news 
media said they discussed only the illegal sanctions against 
panama 
ricardo arias calderon head of the christian democratic party 
said opposition leaders would like to see latin american mediation 
because it would change the focus of the negotiations from a 
confrontation between noriega and the us government to the real 
problem which is the confrontation between noriega and the 
panamanian people 
we would go along with this said alfredo ramirez of the 
nationalist republican liberal movement if the mediation is done 
by presidents now in office 
as chief of the 15000member defense forces noriega is de facto 
leader of the country he was indicted in florida in february on 
us drug trafficking charges noriega denies the charges and has 
resisted us pressure aimed at making him give up power 
arias said monday his party would welcome the efforts of 
countries such as guatemala venezuela costa rica and argentina to 
try to resolve the impasse 
the united states ran out of options other than military 
intervention said a leader of another political party who 
insisted on anonymity now they want to try something different 
the reagan administration tried economic sanctions against 
panama pressure on noriega and then direct negotiations it offered 
to drop the drug indictments issued in florida to induce the general 
to leave but noriega has survived all pressure aided by a core of 
military and political loyalists 
arias said abramowitz had absolutely nothing new to offer on 
his mission here he said he came to evaluate the situation 
following the failure of the us negotiations with noriega he 
reported 
arias said the opposition here insists that any mediation must 
lead to noriegas departure establishment of a new civil government 
and submission of the military to civilian rule

a businessman cited for alleged wrongdoing in 
former attorney general griffin b bells 1985 report about the ef 
hutton check kiting scheme conceded monday he never was authorized 
to make large overdrafts 
john m pearce who formerly managed two hutton branches 
testified that he was routinely exhorted by his superiors at hutton 
to make more money on bank interest 
writing checks against nonexistent funds was a device encouraged 
by hutton to maximize interest profits pearce testified at the us 
district court trial of his lawsuit against bell 
bell was hired by hutton to conduct an internal investigation 
after the company pleaded guilty to 2000 mail and wire fraud 
charges in 1985 
that was the firms policy pearce said i think so long as 
the banks werent injured it was a legitimate way to do business 
pearce contends he and five other branch managers were wrongly 
singled out for criticism in the report that bell issued following 
his threemonth investigation 
but under questioning by bells attorney earl j silbert pearce 
conceded he never received written instructions to exceed the normal 
overdrafting outlined in the hutton drawndown sheet a 
procedure bell concluded was not illegal 
in retrospect i should have been considerably more suspicious 
of being told of things that were not followed up in writing i 
fault myself for that pearce said 
pearce also acknowledged he didnt follow the companys 
guidelines when calculating how much money would be overdrawn from 
branch accounts 
i dont know if they became totally irrelevant but they became 
generally so pearce testified 
bells report exonerated top hutton officials of wrongdoing but 
recommended sanctions against pierce five other branch managers and 
three regional executives bell a partner in the atlanta law firm 
of king amp spalding charged that some top hutton executives had 
failed to properly monitor the operations of branch and regional 
offices 
pearce contends that bell who was president carters first 
attorney general negligently ignored evidence that top hutton 
officials condoned the practice of making large overdrafts on 
company accounts 
government investigators determined that the company gave itself 
interestfree loans up to 250 million at a time by writing checks 
that were not covered by funds in the accounts 
under the elaborate scheme hutton would reimburse an overdrawn 
account with money from another branch before the overdrafted check 
was cleared by the bank 
in many instances the reimbursement check was overdrawn against 
a second account which in turn was replenished with a check 
from yet another hutton account 
this was something that went on in woodies window as it were 
pearce said referring to a washingtonarea department store 
there was no effort to conceal it 
while managing a branch in bethesda md withdrawals from the 
office account were sometimes 10 times to 30 times larger than 
deposits pearce said the companys guidelines specified that 
withdrawals should only exceed an account balance by 50 percent 
pearce testified that he never personally benefited from the 
overdrafting 
pearce who also managed huttons st louis branch said he was 
making 135000 when he left the company last year he made 21000 
as president of a fire safety equipment company he owns in sarasota 
fla pearce said 
when bell published his findings pearce said i was held up as 
a criminal i was finished as a manager in the securities business

gov michael dukakis has stretched his advantage 
over jesse jackson in the california democratic primary to a 21 
margin an abc news tracking poll indicated monday 
the survey had dukakis with 61 percent support among likely 
voters in the tuesday contest and jackson with 30 percent that 
represented a slight gain for dukakis and a slight drop in jacksons 
support during the weekend 
the results were based on 415 telephone interviews saturday and 
sunday dukakis support had been 56 percent in twoday poll 
averages since wednesday and thursday jackson went from 36 percent 
to 34 32 then to 30 percent 
four percent backed former candidate sen albert gore jr in the 
latest poll 4 percent picked someone else and 2 percent were 
undecided the poll had a margin of sampling error of about 6 
percentage points 
it seems very stable twothirds of whites plan to vote 
dukakis only 21 percent of whites are for jackson said jeff 
alderman polling director for abc dukakis leads jackson in all 
demographic groups except blacks 
even among blacks dukakis appeared to be doing better than in 
earlier races he was supported by nearly a quarter of blacks in the 
saturdaysunday poll up from 15 percent in the earlier abc averages 
and considerably better than his showing among blacks in earlier 
primaries alderman said 
because of the imprecision in tracking polls it was not clear 
whether that finding would hold alderman said he noted that 
jacksons supporters as usual supported him more strongly than 
dukakis voters backed their man 
latinos a sizable voting group in california supported dukakis 
in the poll over jackson by a 32 margin alderman said

the defense department and nasa have approved a 
plan to restore and actually expand private industrys capacity to 
produce an important rocket fuel ingredient government sources said 
monday 
the plan involves a series of guarantees for annual purchases and 
the payment of capital construction surcharges to the kerrmcgee 
corp and the pacific engineering products of nevada for the solid 
fuel ingredient ammonium perchlorate said the officials who agreed 
to discuss the matter only if not identified 
the plan is aimed at allowing pacific engineering to rebuild its 
production plant which was completely leveled by a massive 
explosion on may 4 and at encouraging kerrmcgee to expand the 
capacity of its existing plant by up to 50 percent said the 
officials 
ultimately the plan might even be expanded to entice one or more 
other companies to enter the business they said 
the main points of the plan were approved last friday by robert 
b costello undersecretary of defense for acquisition and by top 
officials at the national aeronautics and space administration the 
sources said 
it was discussed with top leaders on capitol hill on monday 
the pacific engineering plant in henderson nev represented 
about 50 percent of the nations production capacity for ammonium 
perchlorate a rocket fuel oxidizer that is essential not only for 
nasas space shuttle but also for a variety of military missiles 
including the mx and minuteman missiles 
government officials warned last month that if the lost capacity 
is not quickly restored both the pentagon and nasa could face 
slowdowns in their spacelaunching schedules 
the sources refused monday to provide any estimates of how much 
the plan would cost the government saying the pentagon probably 
would have more to say on the matter later this week 
the officials did say however the plan avoids any commitment of 
taxpayer money up front instead committing the government to 
pay a special surcharge over a fivetosevenyear period on its 
ammonium perchlorate purchases the surcharge would allow the two 
companies to quickly recover plant construction costs the sources 
said 
the plan envisions pacific engineering essentially restoring all 
of its lost capacity by building a new plant that could produce 
about 40 million pounds per year the sources said 
kerr mcgee would expand its existing plant which can produce 
about 40 million pounds per year to allow production of another 20 
million pounds the officials continued 
the government also would provide the two companies with 
guarantees that it would purchase a minimum of 20 million pounds 
from each of them each year the sources said 
the combination of authorized surcharges and a purchase guarantee 
is expected to make it extremely easy for both companies but 
particularly pacific engineering to line up the financing needed 
to quickly build new facilities 
the sources said the purchase guarantees of 20 million pounds per 
year from each company is actually somewhat less than what the 
government has been buying in recent years thus the significance of 
that part of the plan is simply that a formal commitment would be 
made to reassure lending institutions said one official

they have flown in from around america each 
filling two airline seats to lose weight and call attention to dick 
gregorys call for a national war on obesity 
they are a dozen very fat people from 268 to 600 pounds to whom 
gregory has offered a free last chance to lose weight a service 
the comedianturnednutritionist says the government should be 
rendering 
i never knew this kind of obesity exists gregory said monday 
as he welcomed some arrivals at laguardia airport im saying the 
government has to come in and get involved 
since the case of walter hudson one of several highly publicized 
obese people who have lost weight under gregorys guidance a 
group of invisible fat people have become visible and theyre all 
calling me gregory said 
he said obesity is a much bigger problem than drug addiction 
if obese people started robbing and killing then wed find the 
money to help them 
gregorys charges include ron miller 523 pounds who says his 
eating is a sickness and barbara peeblessmith who weighs about 
half as much but says she wants to be able to cross her legs 
without feeling like im going to have a heart attack 
some have tried overeaters anonymous weight watchers and a 
variety of diets two have had their stomachs stapled one had 
placenta injections and one was injected with the urine of a 
pregnant woman 
the dozen will spend at least a year at a clinic gregory is 
opening in upstate new york they will be placed on a herbal diet 
and exercise routine devised by gregory 
gregory said the treatment program would cost him hundreds of 
thousands of dollars he said part of the tab would be covered by 
his successful nutritional food business 
gregory said he chose these obese people because they had the 
saddest stories and because they seemed healthy enough to diet 
safely 
some talked about suicide he said one lady said she 
prayed she could get cancer i thought it was so she could die she 
said it was so she could get thin 
gregory said the federal government should establish an 
institute on obesity and a clearing house for information on the 
problem he also called for a congressional investigation of what he 
termed this national american health crisis and promised to 
begin a 40day fast and prayer vigil for the obese of our nation 
peeblessmith a 40yearold norfolk va resident told new 
york newsday that she was entering the clinic for my kids because 
i want to live longer 
miller a chef until he slipped and injured himself three years 
ago said people dont understand that eating is a sickness and 
you cant stop 
among mondays arrivals was michael parteleno 30 an activities 
director at a nursing home in youngstown ohio parteleno said he 
weighs 758 pounds more than 200 pounds less than when he went on a 
diet prescribed by gregory he said he hoped to drop to 190 pounds 
over two years 
gregory has engaged in two other highly publicized weight 
reduction campaigns 
in 1986 he helped ron high of brooklyn who weighed 850 pounds 
lose more than 500 pounds last year he took up the case of walter 
hudson a long island man who weighed 1200 pounds hudson lost 400 
pounds under gregorys care and diet but they parted company 
earlier this year after hudson refused to leave his home and check 
into gregorys health spa in the bahamas

clarence m pendleton jr the us civil rights 
commission chairman who fought against affirmative action was 
remembered monday by president reagan as a leading apostle of a 
just and colorblind society 
pendleton 57 one of the reagan administrations highestranking 
blacks collapsed and died sunday of an apparent heart attack while 
exercising at a health club in san diego where he lived 
funeral services for pendleton who had suffered a heart attack 
in 1976 and battled high blood pressure were scheduled wednesday at 
st pauls cathedral in san diego a family spokeswoman said monday 
pendleton drew bitter criticism during his 6year tenure as 
commission chairman for opposing civil rights policies such as 
racial quotas and busing in conformance with reagans stance 
yesterday with the sudden death of clarence pendleton america 
lost a leading apostle of a just and colorblind society reagan 
said in a statement clarence pendleton early in life took up the 
banner of equal rights for all americans and boldly carried the 
banner forward 
reagan also invoked the memory of slain civil rights leader 
martin luther king jr in praising the man he called penny 
pendleton leaves behind a confidence that one day all americans 
will be judged not by stereotypes and prejudices but on their own 
merits qualifications performance as penny often quoted martin 
luther king jr not by the color of their skin but by the 
content of their character 
no autopsy will be performed deputy coroner jack larkie said 
adding that pendletons physician would identify the cause of death 
deputy coroner david lodge said it appeared he had suffered a heart 
attack 
friends and acquaintances remembered pendleton as a dedicated 
public servant and principled man 
john e jacob president and chief executive of the national 
urban league said despite our very forceful disagreement about 
key issues affecting black americans i respected his right to those 
opinions as he respected my right to differ 
he was a good friend and a formidable adversary 
he had a lot of courage and took stands sometimes that 
werent very popular said san diego police chief bill kolender 
who had known pendleton for 15 years 
but san diego county supervisor leon williams called pendleton an 
embarrassment to blacks 
i dont know any black people who thought his positions were 
admirable said williams who is black 
in november 1981 reagan appointed pendleton as commission 
chairman to replace the fired arthur s flemming who had criticized 
the administrations civil rights policies as in conflict with the 
constitution 
the bipartisan commission is an advisory body that monitors 
enforcement of civil rights laws within the federal government it 
lacks policymaking or enforcement powers 
pendleton maintained that equal treatment not special 
preferences should form the basis for federal civil rights 
policies 
he once termed the concept of comparable worth which envisions 
women receiving the same salary as men with similar jobs the 
looniest idea since looney tunes he called affirmative action 
divisive unpopular and immoral and opposed busing 
he also criticized the civil rights restoration act passed 
earlier this year over reagans veto as an unwarranted invasion 
by big brother 
his views made him a lightening rod for criticism of the reagans 
administrations approach to civil rights enforcement 
in july 1986 congressional critics unsuccessfully tried to 
replace the commission with a new office of civil rights assessment 
accusing the commission under pendleton of becoming a political 
instrument of the executive branch 
pendleton dismissed the move and said it simply reflects the 
political differences between some members of congress and the 
commission majority 
pendleton was alone when he collapsed sunday morning in the 
exercise room of the san diego hilton beach and tennis resort said 
gary lingley director of the hotels tennis club pendleton had 
attended regularly since joining the club several months ago 
pendleton an avid jogger and swimmer once taught physical 
education in college and worked as a government recreation director 
in washington and baltimore before being named director of the 
model cities department in san diego in 1972 he was president of 
the urban league in san diego from 1975 until 1982 
pendleton graduated from howard university in 1954 and after 
serving in the army he returned to earn a masters degree in 
education 
pendletons is survived by his wife margrit and their daughter 
paula as well as by two grown children from a previous marriage who 
live in washington dc

two bluecollar workers one of whom 
could find no one to share his bet were catapulted to fame and 
wealth monday when they split north americas largest lottery 
jackpot 514 million 
aircraft mechanic shelby carroll 53 of vacaville and 
sacramento supermarket clerk randy pennington 26 will each receive 
257 million over 20 years lottery officials said 
at a news conference the lotto 649 winners said they both used 
a feature of the lottery terminals that randomly selects ticket 
numbers for the player they said they have few immediate plans 
except to quit their jobs and help family members in various ways 
both also told a crowd of reporters and cheering lottery workers 
that they would be ready for an onslaught of strangers interested in 
their windfalls from the saturday drawing 
carroll a mechanic at travis air force base said he was 
unsuccessful in finding someone to match 50 with his 50 then 
split any winnings from the 100 in bets 
i asked my bossif he would like to share with me i said 
give me 50 and well split the winnings at the time it the 
jackpot was around 40 million he says no i asked a couple 
more of the guys and they said no

headsup penny every time ive ever found a heads up penny

us customs commissioner william von raab 
announced monday the appointment of an ombudsman to advise innocent 
people who become entangled in its zero tolerance antidrug 
program 
janet l labunda has been assigned to help boat owners and other 
individuals avoid unnecessary legal expenses resulting from the 
zerotolerance program he said 
i want to emphasize that this appointment does not mean we are 
backing off zero tolerance one bit von raab said in making the 
announcement 
we are concerned about the small number of innocent people who 
are unfortunate to be unwittingly associated with criminal 
activity he added 
boat owners and civil libertarians last month angrily criticized 
the policy when the owner of the 25 million yacht ark royal had to 
pay 1600 in fines and fees after the service seized the vessel 
because a small amount of marijuana was found the marijuana 
allegedly was taken aboard by a crewman 
the private yacht monkey business known widely as the boat on 
which former democratic presidential candidate gary hart and model 
donna rice spent a weekend with friends was seized outside the 
us 12mile territorial limit on may 14 when a marijuana cigarette 
was found aboard eight ounces of the drug later were found on the 
vessel 
the government later refined its procedures to seize vessels 
outside the 12mile limit only when there was evidence that the boat 
was being used for drug trafficking 
since the government instituted the zerotolerance policy march 
21 more than 1000 arrests have been made and more than 1500 
vessels have been seized customs said

after his death his widow says she is getting through this difficult 
time by trying to focus on the wonderful part to remember what 
he stood for 
in an interview broadcast monday on nbc nightly news ethel 
kennedy declined to speculate what kennedy would think about todays 
political climate but she said anyone who had been around her 
husband and knew how he felt would believe things could be a lot 
better now 
still mrs kennedy said in the interview taped saturday at her 
virginia home i think a lot of people have made some sacrifices 
in their lives to make it a better world and in a lot of ways it 
is 
while kennedy was a passionate man with intense beliefs mrs 
kennedy said he never preached to his children 
probably thats why he had such a tremendous influence on the 
children he never tried to impose his world view on them she 
said he did it by example he brought us all along with his 
enthusiasm his love of life his curiosity and he made 
everybody feel a part of this battle that were going to do better 
that america can stand for something

the killing of a 4yearold girl by an alligator 
triggered a rash of reports of the reptiles near homes in florida 
and a wildlife officer said monday hes now quicker to fulfill 
requests to have the animals killed 
meanwhile another wildlife official warned people not to take 
vigilante action against the usually harmless animals after a report 
that a woman living near the site where the girl was killed attacked 
a small alligator 
lt dick lawrence of the florida game and fresh water fish 
commission said hes stopped trying to explain to people complaining 
about alligators that attacks by the animals are extremely rare 
extremely rare doesnt mean a damn thing with what happened 
this weekend said lawrence alligator coordinator for the game 
commission in a 10county everglades region 
lawrence who issues permits to have statedesignated trappers 
kill troublesome alligators said his office received 80 complaints 
about alligators monday four or five times the normal number 
following the death saturday of young erin glover in englewood 
the child was splashing through shallow water along the shore of 
a lake near her home when a 10foot alligator grabbed her her 
31pound body was recovered more than five hours later after game 
officers shot and killed the alligator 
when people see an alligator especially now all they see is 
the mouthful of teeth and ugliness lawrence said 
i think therell be more permits issued but the kills may not 
go up the trapper may go out there in a day or two and the gators 
not there 
game officials received a report monday that a woman living near 
the site of the fatal attack bashed a 3foot gators head in 
said game commission lt jim farrior officials could not confirm 
the report 
farrior said alligators that small eat only minnows frogs and 
snakes and he cautioned people against taking violent action 
against gators 
i think the vigilante response is not a good response its 
ineffective he said you cant go out on a rampage and start 
killing every gator out there 
wildlife officials will not change their policy for handling 
nuisance alligators farrior said they will kill alligators more 
than 4 feet long if they are aggressive toward people pets or 
livestock or show a lack of fear toward humans 
lawrence said people who live near ponds canals and lakes need 
not panic if they spot an alligator 
including erins death alligators have killed six people and 
engaged in 95 unprovoked attacks in florida since 1948 according to 
game commission statistics 
generally if you leave alligators alone theyll leave you 
alone he said 
franklin percival wildlife biologist with the us fish and 
wildlife service in gainesville said people probably were 
overreacting to erins death but he added that its important to 
respect alligators 
youre just really asking for it when youre dealing with a 
wild animal at close range you have to keep your distance he 
said 
alligators have been a protected species in florida since the 
mid1960s when their population dwindled after years of vigorous 
hunting 
but in recent years their population has rebounded dramatically 
with state wildlife experts estimating there are 1 million 
alligators on 67 million acres on sept 1 for the first time 
since 1962 the state will hold a onemonth gator hunt in which up 
to 3000 will be taken

arab leaders began arriving here monday 
for a summit that a plo official said will help determine the 
direction of the palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied 
territories 
bassam abu sharif spokesman for the palestine liberation 
organization spoke to reporters following his arrival in algiers 
with plo chairman yasser arafat for the extraordinary threeday 
summit that begins tuesday 
he said the meeting will be very important in determining the 
course of the sixmonthold palestinian insurrection in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
the americans are not recognizing the palestinians legitimate 
rights to selfdetermination and the establishment of an independent 
state he said this is why all the proposals put by america are 
born dead 
sharif said political support for the rioting should include a 
unified stand against the latest us peace initiative and a 
reiteration of their endorsement of the plo as the sole 
legitimate representative of the 5 million palestinian people 
inside and outside the occupied territories 
arafat wearing green fatigues and with a pistol on his hip was 
the first leader to arrive for the summit convened to back the 
antiisraeli riots and to unify positions on the us middle east 
initiative 
underscoring arafats participation as a key player president 
chadli bendjedid of algeria accorded him a warm official welcome at 
the airport as if arafat were a fullfledged chief of state a 
young algerian girl gave arafat a bouquet of flowers 
king fahd of saudi arabia king hussein of jordan sheik zayed 
bin sultan annahyan the president of the united arab emirates and 
president sid ahmen ould taya of mauritania flew in after arafat 
the other arrivals were expected to continue into tuesday 
the summit of all 21 members of the arab league was convened by 
bendjedid essentially to strengthen arab support and financial 
backing for the 15 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
strip territories taken from jordan and egypt by israel in the 1967 
middle east war 
attention was sure to be riveted on fahd leader of the richest 
arab nation to see if he will substantially increase the saudi 
subsidy for the uprising 
ideally we would like to see the intefadeh uprising 
transformed into a mahatma gandhistyle civil disobedience 
campaign said a senior plo official speaking on condition of 
anonymity but that means about 10 million a day to compensate 
for loss of income and feed the people 
yasser abed rabbo a member of the plos 15man executive 
committee said the main plo goal at the summit was to draw a 
clearcut unequivocal stand toward the united states and us 
secretary of state george shultzs plan 
shultz was in damascus monday on his fourth attempt to persuade 
syrian president hafez assad to support his plan which calls for 
limited palestinian selfrule to be followed by an international 
conference 
the plan excludes plo participation in the parley it also makes 
no mention of a palestinian state for which the arabs have been 
struggling 
libyan leader moammar gadhafy whose personal participation was 
still in doubt monday night has said he wants the summit to keep 
strictly to the sole item on its agenda the palestinian uprising

question co thach said on the basis of respect for the 
kampuchean peoples right to selfdetermination termination of all 
foreign interference and definitive prevention of any possible 
return of the genocidal and warmongering pol pot regime 
pol pot led the prochinese khmer rouge communist government in 
cambodia the present government in phnom penh backed by vietnam 
and the soviet union has been battling a threeparty coalition that 
includes the forces of former cambodian leader prince norodom 
sihanouk the khmer rouge and the noncommunist forces of former 
cambodian prime minister son sann 
the general assembly repeatedly has rejected the legitimacy of 
the vietnaminstalled government in cambodia and recognizes the 
coalition as the legitimate government at the united nations

been victims for 40 years of successive protracted wars which used

over the soviet union in computer technology 
the defense secretary said the way to maintain that lead is 
through the coordinating committee for export control which 
regulates technology transfer to communist countries he said 
modifications should be made to tighten restrictions on sensitive 
technology and loosen controls on lowertier technology 
it is vital for our collective security that we seek to 
strengthen cocom carlucci said 
last year a subsidiary of toshiba corp was accused of exporting 
sophisticated technology to the soviet union 
carlucci warned that perestroika could lead to further soviet 
militarization 
if the end result is the west relaxes its defense effort and 
the soviet union modernizes its military and industrial base and 
the soviet union can manufacture enormously more weapons than today 
then we will have made a grave mistake he said 
carlucci arrived in japan last week from moscow to brief leaders 
here on the meeting between president reagan and gorbachev and to 
discuss usjapanese security issues with japans defense and 
governing party officials 
the defense secretary lauded the dialogue between moscow and 
washington that is made easier by the summits 
summits like the one just concluded make good sense he said 
but as we focus on the summit process we must not lose sight of 
this central fact better relations must be built on a strong 
foundation our ability to defend ourselves and our interests 
summitry is no substitute for security 
he noted that we as yet see no change in the soviet offensive 
military structure

a navy recruit who a pathologist said died 
of sheer terror after being forced into a swimming pool had been 
found psychologically unfit for rescue swimmer training it was 
revealed monday 
but a psychiatrist at the naval aerospace medical institute later 
reversed the finding giving qualified permission for airman recruit 
lee mirecki to resume training said chief petty officer kevin 
brannigan a hospital corpsman 
brannigan testified at a hearing to determine whether five 
instructors and their commanding officer at the rescue swimmer 
school should be courtmartialed in the death of mirecki on march 2 
mirecki 19 of appleton wis died after instructors allegedly 
forced him back into the pool when he tried to quit the course 
during a drill 
lt cmdr dave shivley a navy flight surgeon originally found 
mirecki unqualified saying in a report introduced as evidence that 
the recruit had a phobia about being dragged under water 
in a followup psychiatric examination lt cmdr laszlo i 
navradszky reversed shivley and wrote on medical records that 
mireckis problem was occupational rather than a mental illness 
brannigan said 
but navradszky also wrote that if mirecki had further 
difficulties he would be disqualified from further rescue training 
brannigan said 
i didnt realize just like the doctor didnt realize that a 
student would be made to continue training after he asked to quit 
brannigan testified 
if they had brannigan said he was sure navradszky would not have 
allowed mirecki to resume training earlier testimony indicated it 
was the schools policy to require a student to complete a drill if 
he tried to drop out during the exercise 
earlier capt delroy hire who performed the autopsy on mirecki 
and declared the death to be a homicide testified it was a major 
breach of procedure to send the sailor back to training instructors 
at the school were not told of the report about mireckis phobia 
records showed 
i do not believe under the circumstances he should have been 
put back in the water hire said 
also monday a navy spokesman denied an nbc news report citing 
pentagon records that one of the accused petty officer 2nd class 
john w zelenock had failed to meet instructor qualifications 
because of a belowminimum evaluation and a disciplinary problem 
all of the accused were qualified to teach the class said 
lt lee saunders public affairs officer for the naval air training 
command 
in his testimony hire said mirecki within reasonable medical 
certainty would not have died if he had reentered the water 
voluntarily or had been allowed to stay out of the pool at the 
pensacola naval air station 
we are talking about sheer terror hire said of mireckis 
phobia of being pulled under water 
asked by the prosecutor lt cmdr larry d wynne whether it 
would be accurate to say mirecki was scared to death hire replied 
it wouldnt be inappropriate at all 
hire testified that the phobia trigged a reflex spasm that closed 
mireckis throat to shut out water after he was returned to the pool 
the reflex however also kept air from getting to his lungs 
causing cardiac arrest and subsequent drowning said hire head of 
the laboratory at the pensacola naval laboratory 
the instructors each have been charged with involuntary 
manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery while lt thomas a 
torchia commanding officer of the navy rescue swimmer school is 
charged with dereliction of duty 
earlier testimony indicated mirecki had left the pool during an 
exercise called sharks and daisies in which an instructor 
randomly grabs a student in a head hold to simulate what a panicky 
drowning victim might do 
mirecki held on to an equipment rack shouting that he wanted to 
quit the course but instructors converged on him one of them 
saying get him or get mirecki fellow students testified 
two instructors who were not charged testified sunday they saw 
other instructors throw or slide mirecki back into the pool acting 
head instructor petty officer 2nd class michael w combe took him to 
the deep end and put another head hold on him witnesses said 
mirecki escaped the hold and was towing combe when he collapsed 
and combe pulled him to the edge of the pool witnesses said 
hire who based his findings on medical records criminal 
investigative reports and discussions with physicians who tried to 
revive mirecki as well as the autopsy said he was aware that a 
psychologist who interviewed the recruit prior to his death had 
concluded that he did not have a phobia of the water 
phobias are very specific you dont have to have a fear of the 
water hire said you have fear of being grabbed and pulled 
under the water 
under crossexamination defense lawyers questioned hires 
qualifications to offer opinions about mental conditions

the senate passed a bill aimed at us 
military bases monday that bans nuclear weapons and nucleararmed 
warships from the philippines similar legislation is pending in the 
house of representatives 
the vote was 193 with one abstention 
most senators favoring the bill spoke of the dangers nuclear 
weapons pose the three opposed said the law would cause problems 
with the united states over the future of clark air base the subic 
bay naval base and smaller us installations in the country 
sen edgardo angara abstained and said the senate should consider 
the position of president corazon aquino who has pledged to respect 
the bases agreement until it expires in 1991 and to keep options 
open on an extension 
in washington the state department sharply criticized the bill 
as drafted the bill would permit no flexibility on nuclear 
matters and would be incompatible with our policy of neither 
confirming nor denying the presence or absence of nuclear weapons on 
us vessels aircraft and facilities said deputy spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley 
there was no indication when the house would debate its version 
of the bill mrs aquino can veto legislation but congress can 
override the veto by twothirds vote of each chamber 
opposition to nuclear weapons and to the american bases is 
believed to be stronger in the senate than in the 200member house 
the united states opposes any prohibitions that curtail the 
ability of its ships and planes to carry nuclear weapons it has 
objected to similar measures in new zealand and denmark 
provisions of the philippine bill set prison terms of up to 30 
years for bringing nuclear weapons into the country and up to 12 
years for importing nuclear components 
supporters said the measure is directed at the six us 
installations where nuclear weapons are believed to be stored the 
united states will not confirm or deny whether it has nuclear 
weapons in the philippines or whether a ship or aircraft carries 
them 
sen wigberto tanada the chief sponsor said the law would force 
us authorities to respect the philippine constitution which 
prescribes a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons consistent 
with the national interest 
he also said it would contribute to the ongoing process for 
detente denuclearization and disarmament in this part of the 
world 
jovito salonga the senate president said the philippines 
should not be a promoter of the deadly arms race we should never be 
part of the problem we should be part of the solution 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile said he supported the bill to 
protest the aquino governments inaction on the constitutional 
nuclear ban and because the presence of nuclear weapons in our 
territory is inconsistent with the national interest 
the bill forbids storage or transit of nuclear weapons and the 
entry of nucleararmed ships or aircraft but it allows port calls 
by nuclearpowered commercial and research vessels after inspection 
by philippine authorities 
us officials have said such a law would severely limit american 
military operations particularly those of the navy at the subic bay 
base northwest of manila 
under the new constitution any extension of the bases agreement 
must take the form of a treaty approved by a twothirds vote of the 
senate the philippine congress also can require a referendum 
philippine and us officials began a review of the agreement in 
april 
defense secretary fidel ramos told a house committee monday the 
antinuclear bill was not completely satisfactory and requested 
amendments that would give mrs aquino greater flexibility in the 
matter and in her dealings with the united states 
most of the weapons and equipment with which the philippine 
military fights a 19yearold communist insurgency come from the 
united states the main ally of this pacific archipelago of 7100 
islands

rebels from nicaragua are coming to canada on false 
passports opposition members of parliament complained monday 
citing reports from costa rica 
immigration minister barbara mcdougall told parliament there is 
a very large international problem of false documentation and said 
the government was taking serious action to combat it 
she noted that the royal canadian mounted police arrested two sri 
lankan men in montreal last weekend and seized material used to make 
200 forged canadian travel permits allowing foreigners lacking 
genuine passports to enter canada 
the toronto globe and mail said monday that 300 to 600 nicarguans 
living in costa rica have used forged documents to enter canada in 
the past eight months 
it said the operation was run by the usbacked guerrillas 
known as contras who are fighting nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government 
the report said canadian officials in costa rica learned of the 
forgeries in april but the racket continues 
since the beginning of last year 1335 nicaraguans have claimed 
refugee status at canadian airports some of them holding genuine 
passports 
sergio marchi immigration spokesman for the opposition liberal 
party said many contras have horrible human rights violation 
records and should be barred from canada 
dan heap a member of parliament from the opposition new 
democratic party complained that in canadas official refugee 
program the government welcomed 1177 nicaraguans between january 
1987 and march 1988 while taking only 568 guatemalans where the 
danger is far greater at the moment 
ms mcdougall responded that applicants are considered on a 
casebycase basis she said that however an immigrant or refugee 
enters canada war criminals and terrorists are unacceptable and the 
system will eventually reject them 
prime minister brian mulroneys conservative government has 
proposed legislation to toughen immigration and refugee laws but 
the opposition parties have delayed passage contending that the 
bills would penalize the genuinely needy as well as illegal aliens

investigators examined the charred remains 
of two egg farms monday to try to determine what set off blazes that 
killed 240000 hens destroyed thousands of eggs and caused 75 
million in damage 
the hens were killed at cohen egg farms in this tiny southern 
maine town late saturday in a fire that engulfed three barns before 
firefighters arrived debris from the 480footlong buildings was 
still smoldering two days later and that and the stench of charred 
birds hampered investigators 
about 60 trailer loads of eggs were destroyed sunday in a fire 
that swept through the storage and packing facilities at decoster 
egg farms the nations largest brown egg producer in turner fire 
chief laurence gagne said no livestock died 
bruce e mullen fire chief of goodwins mills near dayton 
estimated the loss at cohen farms at 25 million gagne said the 
damage at decoster farms located 12 miles north of auburn was 
about 5 million 
investigators from the state fire marshals office said 
determining the cause of both fires could take up to a week 
weve got no idea investigator joseph a levasseur said 
surveying the smoldering ruins at cohen farms well start at one 
end and work our way to the other i havent ruled out anything at 
this point 
state department of environmental protection officials urged 
dayton town officials to quickly dispose of the charred chickens 
but officials said neither the birds nor debris from the 
buildings could be buried at the fire site because the ground is 
sandy gravely and susceptible to seepage and a suitable burial 
site had not yet been found said peter n mosher of the state 
department of agriculture 
the board discussed the disposal question at a monday night 
meeting but deferred a decision until tuesday selectman clement 
meserve jr said 
despite the loss of the hens which produced nearly 200000 eggs 
per day cohen farms remained in operation monday with eight 
surviving hen houses on that farm said dennis babb a supervisor at 
cohen 
cohen which also owns other egg farms in maine has about 
600000 hens making it one of northern new englands largest egg 
producers 
lost egg production will be made up through contracts with 
smaller egg producers in the area said lois l hall a secretary to 
cohen owner maurice cohen 
this is not the first time fire has swept through the decoster 
farm on march 7 1987 fire destroyed 25000 hens

morton thiokol inc which produced the rocket 
booster blamed for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle 
challenger announced monday it will stay out of competition to 
build an advanced version of the rocket 
the chicagobased company said in a statement it wants to 
concentrate its resources on its immediate task of redesigning the 
booster blamed for the 1986 deaths of seven astronauts shortly after 
takeoff from kennedy space center in florida 
the national aeronautics and space administration plans to use 
thiokols redesigned motor when it resumes shuttle flights nasa 
spokeswoman sarah keegan said monday night from her home in 
washington dc the advanced motor will be used in the mid1990s 
she said 
the companys redesigned solid rocket motor program is almost 
complete with a test firing set for july at cape canaveral fla 
said rocky raab a morton thiokol spokesman in salt lake city utah 
thiokol was the lone manufacturer of shuttle motors and nasa must 
look elsewhere for producers of the new version the advanced solid 
rocket motor 
although bidding has not opened for the advanced motor three 
other parties have expressed an interest in the contract raab said 
he identified them as united technologies the bidding team of 
lockheed and aerojet and another team consisting of hercules 
atlantic research corp and martin marietta 
a presidential commission blamed the deaths of seven astronauts 
including teacher christa mcauliffe seconds after launch on jan 
28 1986 on a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a 
solidfuel booster rocket built by thiokol and ignited the main fuel 
tank thiokol immediately undertook the task of redesigning the 
motor 
reading from a statement keegan said nasa anticipates a 
healthy degree of competition for the asrm advanced motor contract 
when the request for proposals is released and we look forward to 
our continued association with morton thiokol in the curent solid 
rocket motor program 
thiokols decision not to seek the asrm contract follows an 
earlier nasa announcement that the space agency wants to build a 
governmentowned facility to produce the larger rocket motors and 
subcontract with a private manufacturer to operate the plant 
nasa has earmarked 27 million of its current budget for design 
and initial construction of a new booster plant somewhere on the 
gulf coast officials have said they plan to add 65 million from 
next years budget to fund the project and estimate it will take at 
least 10 years to get such a plant funded and operational 
thiokol a manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals high 
technology propulsion systems and salt plans to invest 200 million 
in the next several years to modernize its plant in northern utah in 
order to seek other space and defense business raab said 
the plant located 90 miles north of salt lake city is one of 
utahs largest private employers with 2500 workers 
thiokol continues to supply shuttle booster hardware under a 
contract with nasa the company also will build a new 
environmentally controlled building for the redesigned version of 
the old solid rocket booster 
the new facility the company is planning will involve case 
refurbishment nozzle manufacture and propellant casting he said 
adding that morton thiokol intends to go after the air force 
advanced launch system a strapon booster and other contracts

as soviet troops proceed with their 
withdrawal from afghanistan the war between government forces and 
anticommunist guerrillas is entering a new stage 
the ultimate test will be whether either side can muster enough 
cohesion military might and popular acceptance to impose its will 
on a nation that throughout history has resisted control by any 
central authority 
the ussupported moslem guerrillas have proved themselves adept 
at defending their home turf in the countryside but in a decade of 
fighting they have yet to capture a major city 
almost every night one or more guerrilla rockets land in or near 
kabul but these attacks seem to constitute little more than 
harassment not a battle for the capital which is still defended 
by soviet soldiers

could eventually triumph over the sovietstyle government but only

lively and sometimes critical political 
reporting is showing up on the pages of taiwans newspapers as a 
liberalization trend sweeps the island nation 
the zestier coverage began in january when the government lifted 
a 37yearold ban on the establishment of new newspapers and the era 
of rule by chiang kaishek and his family came to an end 
with the market suddenly open to new competition newspapers 
attracted new readers among taiwans 196 million people by breaking 
taboos on stories about the chiang family allegations of 
malfeasance by top officials and highlevel power struggles 
the changes have been substantial although it may take some 
time before we can have the fullfledged freedom the western press 
enjoys said fu cheng a political science professor who was 
jailed for six years after his magazine was banned in 1960 for 
criticizing the chiangs longgoverning nationalist party 
it became clear the old rules no longer applied when newspapers 
exposed a power struggle among nationalist leaders after the death 
of president chiang chingkuo on jan 13 ending a family dynasty 
begun by his father chiang kaishek six decades earlier 
readers were startled by newspaper reports indicating but never 
confirmed that madame chiang kaishek the fathers widow who is in 
her early 90s and now lives in seclusion in suburban taipei was 
behind a lastditch effort to delay the naming of the new president 
lee tenghui as acting party chairman 
this would have been unthinkable just two years ago said hu 
yuanhui a reporter of the liberal independence evening post 
there would have been an order for the shutdown of the 
newspapers 
alice kao deputy editor in chief of the masscirculation united 
daily news said that almost all political taboos were lifted 
overnight and that authorities stopped interfering with news 
coverage so long as newspapers did not espouse communism or question 
the nationalists claim that they should govern mainland china too 
the nationalist government came to power on the mainland early in 
the century but fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to 
mao tsetungs communists 
the nationalists since have exercised oneparty rule over taiwan 
with the newspaper restrictions a method to allow close government 
control of the media editors frequently received late night 
telephone calls from nationalist officials demanding that 
unfavorable stories be dropped or played down 
ending restrictions on the number of newspapers that could 
publish is part of a recent liberalization program initiated by 
chiang chingkuo before his death the program included the 
scrapping of martial law the formation of opposition parties and 
the release of political prisoners 
among the articles published in taiwan newspapers this year 
reports identifying chiang chingkuos illegitimate twin sons 
one a vice foreign minister and the other the dean of a prominent 
law school 
critical reporting about the military including articles 
suggesting the armed forces may wield too much power 
sensationalized stories that a top taiwanese nuclear scientist 
allegedly worked for the us central intelligence agency and fled 
to the united states with secrets about a nuclear development 
program the nationalist government denies it builds atomic bombs 
expanded coverage of mainland china in part because the 
newspapers have increased in size from the usual 12 pages to 24 a 
maximum they themselves established 
since the media ban was lifted the government has issued 
licenses for about 50 new newspapers meanwhile the existing 30 
newspapers including seven owned by the government and two by the 
nationalist party have upgraded their printing equipment and 
recruited new reporters 
market force dominates now professor fu said the days are 
gone when newspaper reports were twisted under political forces 
opposition politicians however claim that most newspapers still 
do not give prominence to opposition views and activities while 
president lee receives a generally favorable press 
the opposition also notes that taiwans 33 radio stations and 
three television networks remain under government control 
but chang chunhong who heads a research center affiliated with 
the opposition democratic progressive party said that while many 
newspapers remain conservative the important thing is we now have 
a society of many voices 
another sign of the times is that owners of the two largest 
newspaper chains recently submitted their resignations from the 
nationalist partys policymaking central standing committee the 
move is viewed as an effort to improve the newspapers credibility

the deaths of five students after excessive 
disciplining by teachers over the past three years has raised 
concern about corporal punishment and rigid rules in japanese 
schools 
the death toll is unprecedented said morikatsu imahashi an 
ibaraki university professor specializing on such issues in the 
postwar period up to 1985 there was only one known case where a 
student died of injuries inflicted by a teacher and that was in 
1957 
corporal punishment was banned under japanese law after world war 
ii but following a wave of student violence in the late 1970s 
education officials resurrected rigid rules of prewar times and 
approved physical force in the classroom 
the result imahashi and other critics say is a controlled 
education system but an alarming rise in physical abuse of students 
by teachers 
a growing number of children and adults are starting to 
question the validity of corporal punishment and all those strange 
rules but not enough has been done said yasuhiro yoshimine 
a lawyer and leading member of a juvenile rights committee in the 
japan federation of bar associations 
the first of the five students to die after being punished was 
16yearold toshinau takahashi who in 1985 used a hair dryer in 
violation of school rules his teacher ordered him down on his knees 
and repeatedly hit and kicked him until he fell unconscious with 
mortal head injuries 
a court sentenced the teacher to three years in prison for 
inflicting bodily injury resulting in death in 1987 another 
instructor received the same threeyear sentence for causing the 
classroom death of an 8yearold the other three cases are still 
pending in the courts 
the education ministry said last fall that the number of public 
school teachers fired or suspended for corporal punishment reached a 
record high of 189 in 1986 additionally almost 900 teachers were 
reprimanded or warned for going too far in disciplining their 
students 
with compulsory education to age 15 japan has 217 million 
students in public and private schools from elementary to high 
school 
in a wellpublicized incident in may a teacher in charge of a 
fourday school outing near tokyo beat a student for having a poor 
attitude and then went on to similarly punish 30 others who had 
been ordered to line up in the hallway one by one 
other teachers have attacked students with metal bats or joined 
in groups to punch offending students 
takeshi hayashi 20yearold author of two popular books 
condemning school rules and violent teachers claims schools are 
retreating to the authoritarian pattern of prewar japan by insisting 
that students follow strict dress and behavior codes 
some 90 percent of students in public junior high schools are 
required to wear dark militarystyle suits for boys and sailor 
outfits for girls in the the 1960s only about 10 percent of the 
schools in tokyo had dress codes 
most students today are also expected to cut their hair precisely 
to school specifications wear standard white underwear and adhere 
to an endless list of rules that apply both on and off school 
grounds 
but whats worse is corporal punishment said hayashi who 
has become a teenage hero for writing his books 
physical punishment was an everyday happening in the 
tokyoarea schools he attended he said in an interview 
but he added that his experience paled in comparison to the 
stories recounted in about 3000 letters he received from youths 
around the country 
in my schools teachers never touched the girls then i got 
letters from wayoff places where it seems really wild like 
teachers grabbing girls by the head and chopping off their hair in 
front of the other students just for disobeying hairstyle rules 
following public outcry over recent incidents of alleged teacher 
brutality the education ministry has urged school officials to 
practice moderation in drawing up rules and dealing out punishment 
but sadanobu miwa education professor at chiba university says 
the government should be tackling the education system as a whole 
not just branding teachers as culprits 
japanese schools are pressurecookers where students prepare at 
an early age for difficult extrance examinations for prestigious 
universities 
miwa said those who make it into the teaching profession have 
excelled in the education system but they tend to be underdeveloped 
as human beings 
and it is these people put in front of 40 pupils who turn to 
corporal punishment to control the classroom miwa said

after 15 years of breakneck population 
and industrial growth latin america is taking stock of its progress 
in environmental protection and it is not happy with what it sees 
following a landmark international conference in stockholm 
sweden in 1972 on the environment latin americans set out with 
high hopes of promoting growth while protecting its largely 
untouched resources 
throughout the area special government ministries and 
departments were created pollution standards were approved and 
millions of dollars were spent on campaigns to protect the 
environment 
but the results have not been what we would have desired 
conceded jose lizarraga director of the united nations 
environmental program for latin america and the caribbean 
in practice environmental management lost the priority status 
it had been given and in some cases was simply forgotten he said 
in an interview even while there has been a big advance in terms 
of consciousnessraising there has not been such improvement in 
actual management 
lizarraga met with latin american officials involved with 
environmental issues for a conference here in april to assess the 
regions progress in protecting its environment 
the officials blamed the deterioration on burgeoning urban 
populations and industrial growth which lizarraga called 
predatory and shortsighted 
in mexico city now one of the largest cities in the world too 
many vehicles using leaded gasoline have led to air pollution so bad 
that people often cant wear contact lenses 
in just two generations brazils population has changed from 70 
percent rural to 73 percent urban with sewerless shantytowns 
ringing major cities and an 8millionunit housing deficit 
most large latin american cities have seen immigrants swarm in 
from the countryside to live in substandard housing without running 
water sewage facilities garbage disposal or paved roads 
but even widespread urban housing and health problems are 
surpassed by industrial pollution in terms of longrange damage the 
environmental experts said 
while pollution standards and procedures for dealing with wastes 
are often on the books enforcement is lax and penalties are often 
painless 
in venezuela the worst penalty for violating an environmental law 
is a 50000bolivar fine about 3400 at the official exchange 
rate and three days in jail according to environment vice minister 
carlos barrios 
treatment of industrial effluents often is inadequate or 
nonexistant and wastes are being dumped into rivers or lakes used 
for recreation and drinking in violation of laws on the books 
fertilizers including some that are limited or banned in 
industrialized countries also are being used to gain more 
production faster from poor land the environmental experts said 
in venezuela before a cleanup effort began in 1984 lake 
maracaibo was nearly dead from the dumping of untreated waste from 
industries on its shores and from maracaibo a city of 1 million 
which until recently had no sewage treatment plant 
according to lizarraga and others latin americas poor record in 
environmental protection is mainly a political problem 
environmental repair is more costly than prevention even 
though prevention can cost more in the shortterm the problem is 
that politicians have a shortterm view lizarraga said 
officials also note that latin americas debt crises have made 
the situation worse 
government spending for environmental concerns has been cut to 
pay huge foreign debts 
at the same time the need to produce and export more so that 
debts can be paid has aggravated the regions tendency to exploit 
its natural resources as intensively as possible 
sometimes you lose hope lizarrage said but over the last 
15 years there has been a process of maturity and 
consciousnessraising what we have to do now is transform this 
consciousness into action

composer craig safan was looking for the right 
sound to express the feeling of nbcs cheers 
one of the most important things a film composer does is come 
up with a sound for a project he said every movie and 
television show sounds different after reading the first script of 
cheers the sound came to me 
i said i wanted an instrument that sounds like a bar jimmy 
burrows whos the director and one of the executive producers 
suggested a clarinet then it came to me woody allen playing the 
clarinet at 3 am in a bad band its not slick theyre not trying 
to impress anyone its just woody allen and a few guys playing 
because they love to play 
safan writes the background music for cheers he did not 
write the theme song that opens the show 
we do the music for cheers at a studio said safan i 
play the piano 
safan has composed the theme music for abcs supercarrier and 
scores for the twilight zone alfred hitchcock presents and 
amazing stories he wrote music for such tv movies as 
samaritan the mitch snyder story timestalkers and 
getting married and more recently the theatrical feature 
stand and deliver 
ordinarily safan records most of his music in the little studio 
in the converted garage behind his home he works primarily with 
electronics but may find a tune in anything from a plastic water 
bottle to his sons xylophone 
he recorded the soundtrack for stand and deliver in the 
studio his primary instruments were a water bottle and a lag bolt 
it has a feeling of traditional latin music in the main 
title he said but i tried to go into the subtext what is this 
really about its about a man yearning to do something specific for 
people it never matters that its a latin story its like saying 
romeo and juliet is a story about two italians 
i listened to a lot of latin music but there are so many 
different kinds then i began to mimic sounds i used a water bottle 
for a conga i recorded it digitally and played it back through the 
computer the guiro is a gourd with little ridges you scrape with a 
piece of wood i took a lag bolt and scraped wood along the threads 
and recorded it digitally in the synclavier you can record every 
possible sound into the computer thats how you turn a lag bolt 
into a percussion instrument 
his studio is lighted by skylights one side is all glass and 
opens onto what will be a japanese garden a 400yearold buddha is 
set up there and the gate is a 100yearold japanese sliding door 
since i do most of my work at home i want to create my own 
environment he said 
he composed a japanese musical that was performed at the 
goodspeed opera house in east haddam conn which is where 
annie and man of la mancha began the musical butterfly 
is an adaptation of madam butterfly and was done in 
collaboration with mark mueller 
for alfred hitchcock presents he used his sons toys 
bells a xylophone and a shake toy to make a sinister sound for the 
show 
safan began writing music while a student at brandeis university 
i came back to los angeles and got into the record business he 
said then some friends of mine were doing a small film at the 
american film institute i did the music for them 
than another old friend walter park was working on a 
documentary called the california reich he said i wrote a 
piece for a string quartet and flute and used a mellatron which was 
an early electronic instrument 
next he did a small horror film and assignments began coming his 
way steadily 
it wasnt something i went after he said the jobs came to 
me after i said this is what i want to do

the ancestral home of millions of people on 
taiwan is here in fujian province on the chinese mainland and local 
officials are trying to lure taiwanese businessmen back 
they have even enlisted the aid of a chinese sea goddess 
taiwan and fujian are separated by 100 miles of water in the 
formosa strait and 40 years of hostility between the communist 
mainland and nationalist taiwan 
some businessmen have come to fujian nevertheless even at the 
risk of prosecution at home 
deputy gov you dexin told visiting foreign reporters that 50 
taiwan firms have defied their governments ban on trade contacts 
with the mainland to invest about 50 million in the province 
the actual number may be much higher most taiwanese avoid 
trouble at home by contracting under the names of hong kong agents 
or relatives on the mainland 
taiwanfujian trade which totalled 40 million last year 
reached 20 million in the first four months of 1988 you said most 
goes through middlemen in hong kong although more than 10 percent 
is done out on the taiwan strait overall indirect trade between 
taiwan and the entire chinese mainland was an estimated 15 billion 
last year 
fujian officials said among the ideas for bringing in more taiwan 
money are plans to turn three offshore islands into economic zones 
for taiwan investors 
one is meizhou home of the 10th century legendary figure mazu 
who is worshipped on both sides of the strait as a protrectress for 
seafarers for businessmen braving the still stormy waters of the 
strait mazu could provide welcome shelter 
taiwan has been estranged from the mainland since the 
nationalists lost a civil war to the communists in 1949 and fled to 
the island 
china which regards taiwan as a renegade province encourages 
direct trade and communications links as a first step toward 
reunification in the past taiwan adamantly refused all contacts 
with the mainland but it began in october to allow people to visit 
relatives in china 
in the first six months after travel restrictions were lifted 
65000 taiwanese came to china many to fujian where about 80 
percent of taiwans 196 million people have their roots 
fujian officials say it is inevitable that taiwan with its 
currency appreciating against the us dollar and its wage costs 
rising will move factories to china where labor is much cheaper 
and where language and customs are the same 
they can make money here said chen he magistrate of a 
township in the provincial capital of fuzhou which is building a 
24million sports equipment factory with a taiwanese businessman 
this is their homeland and they love it 
during a recent press tour of the province people frequently 
talked of contacts with taiwan enterprises 
hong ziwei a 29yearold toy manufacturer in shishi said he 
would meet a taiwan businessman in august to discuss a joint venture 
to export toys the taiwanese man he said had written a letter to 
a local relative asking for help in finding a mainland partner 
in quanzhou mayor chen rongchun said sweet potatoes a favorite 
among millions of taiwanese with roots in fujian could be a big 
seller on taiwan 
taiwan compatriots will cherish an intimate kind of emotion for 
goods coming from this place he said 
much of the taiwanese investment goes to xiamen a southern 
fujian port that is one of the nations four designated special 
economic zones with greater authority to attract foreign investment 
xiamens authorities said 39 projects with anticipated taiwanese 
investment worth 42 million have been approved in such fields as 
jewelry shoes bicycle parts and aluminum window frames 
while emphasizing that taiwan is part of china mainland 
officials say taiwanese are given the same preferential treatment as 
foreign investors or better in xiamen for example 
taiwanesefunded joint ventures receive a fouryear tax holiday 
rather than the three years given foreign enterprises 
two taiwanese business executives in may were given fiveyear 
prison terms by a taipei court for business dealings on the 
mainland because of that fujian officials promise to keep secret 
the details of all taiwanese transactions 
the first question we take into consideration is their personal 
security deputy gov you said we take measures to keep their 
names secret

for 500 years brazils northeast has 
been potentially rich and chronically poor 
today as brazil struggles to become a modern developed nation 
the northeast holds it back not wholly of its own accord 
the nine northeastern states cover 1 million square miles of land 
where brazil bulges out into the atlantic in the area 2 times the 
size of texas live 45 million of the nations 143 million people 
but while the prosperous south with its airplane and computer 
factories has made brazil the worlds eighthlargest economy the 
northeast remains poor neglected diseased and assailed by 
devastating cyclical droughts 
statistics paint a gloomy picture of the northeast 
infant mortality is higher than in subsaharan africa at 124 
deaths per 1000 births compared to 67 per 1000 in the south 
life expectancy is 51 years compared with 67 in the south 
a full 50 percent of northeasterners cannot write their own 
names 26 percent cant elsewhere in brazil 
diseases longeradicated elsewhere leprosy chagas disease 
polio tuberculosis even the plague still kill and deform in the 
northeast 
were creating a race of undersized subhumans who think only of 
survival said carlos hollanda labor health secretary for the 
northeasts ceara state 
in the early 1960s president john f kennedy recognized the 
parched region considered one of the worlds poorest as a possible 
source of social unrest shortly after fidel castros revolution in 
cuba kennedy launched the us alliance for progress which 
promised billions of dollars and poured millions into development of 
brazils northeast until a 1964 brazilian rightwing military coup 
eased fears of a communist or leftwing uprising 
droughts were a tragic part of the northeastern landscape even 
before portuguese conquerers recorded the first one more than 400 
years ago 
a drought that lasted from 1979 to 1984 killed an estimated 
250000 peasant farmers and chased millions more to big city slums 
in search of food water and jobs 
this year an expected rainfall of 31 inches will provide a 
respite for the characteristically smallstatured northeasterners 
but it is not likely to alter their struggle to survive 
the essential problem here is not whether it rains or not 
said ari guimaraes head of the political science department of the 
university of bahia another northeastern state the problem is 
that the government hasnt built reservoirs explored underground 
water supplies irrigated peasant properties or distributed land 
among those who have no means to survive 
from the 1500s well into the 19th century the northeast was a 
productive area but the wealth stayed with a few 
agriculture led the economic activity and the vast open spaces 
lent themselves to production of brazils most precious commodities 
at the time cattle cotton sugar tobacco and much later coffee 
the portuguese crown handed out large stretches of land to nobles 
and deserving soldiers but far from central government control in 
the south northeast landowners set wildwest laws for peasant 
subjects and used private armies to chase individual farmers 
from modestsized lands 
such scenes have been pointedly described by brazils leading 
novelist jorge amado in gabriela clove and cinnamon bahia 
and most recently showdown 
successive governments have made promises to wrench the inland 
population from medievallike poverty but gun battles over land and 
vast misuse of government funds in the region are still common 
the military government that governed from 1964 through 1985 
built dams for hydroelectric power roads soccer stadiums and 
stretched electricty lines across the dry cracked land one tough 
military president the late gen emilio medici who is said to have 
condoned the torture of political opponents was on the verge of 
tears when he saw the northeasts poverty first hand 
but the grandiose projects of the military government did little 
to ease the average northeasterners lack of food jobs water and 
land 
a common belief among northesterns is that the few direct 
investments in their social concerns such as food and water 
distributions during droughts and emergency workrelief jobs were 
turned to political advantage by local landowning politicians who 
pass along favors to those who vote for them 
it is in the interests of the landowners to maintain the region 
in utter poverty claimed maria luiza fontenelle mayor of 
fortaleza capital of ceara and the northeasts largest city with a 
population of 16 million 
when people are poor they depend upon favors to survive 
according to bishop jose rodrigues of the roman catholic church 
in the hinterlands of bahia mayors control local unions and decide 
who gets access to government health care jobs and other benefits 
when the military stepped down and civilian government returned 
to brazil in 1985 hopes for widespread social reforms ran high but 
many northeasterners say civilian rule for them has been a hollow 
triumph 
last year the region sold 44 billion worth of fruit nuts 
cocoa sugar tobacco and petroleum to southern brazil and foreign 
countries but received only 1 billion in government investments 
promises of a land reform irrigation of 25 million acres of 
land and 2 million jobs were slashed as the government of president 
jose sarney sought to to cut a massive budget deficit control 
runaway inflation projected at 600 percent annually and meet 
payments on a 121 billion foreign debt 
most significantly brazils proposed new constitution makes 
virtually impossible a longpromised land reform to distribute the 
46 percent of rural properties owned by just 12 percent of the 
population the catholic church has accused the government of bowing 
to powerful landowners on the issue 
but political scientists say the northeasts problems are fast 
becoming problems for the rest of the country most particularly the 
more affluent south 
northeasterners for example now occupied whole shanty towns in 
the major cities of rio de janeiro and sao paulo pressing already 
precarious social and health services and pushing up crime rates 
brazil will never be a stable democracy nor a developed 
country without resolving its vast inequalities said one 
political scientist helio jaguaribe 
but the political balance also may be shifting 
in the 1986 gubernatorial elections northeasterners chose four 
governors who are considered politically progressive and more likely 
to contest landowner power 
mayor fontenelle of fortaleza for example is a member of the 
radical workers party 
at the same time the roman catholic church presses on its own 
for change 
bishop rodrigues has helped rural workers in seven of his 11 
doceses take control of local labor unions often resulting in gun 
and stick battles between private armies of conservative mayors and 
local farmers 
in jucas a town of 8000 people 300 miles west of fortaleza the 
rev hans stecker a german priest who arrived 28 years ago wages a 
relentless battle with mayor jose fagundes also the towns largest 
landowner 
the priest has built a hospital 39 schools and preschools and 
started health and education programs stecker said that in response 
to his projects the threeterm mayor cut churchs telephone lines 
and prohibited the teaching of religion in town schools 
in some towns said political scientist guimaraes the 
local priest cant leave home without a gun

the government says its campaign to reduce 
atmospheric pollution is working but some among athens 35 million 
people are not so sure 
for years the capital has been plagued by a brown layer of 
noxious smoke exhaust fumes and factory emissions that athenians 
call the nefos greek for cloud 
on a warm windless day the nefos sends an average of 300 
athenians to hospitals complaining of headaches chest pains nausea 
and stinging eyes 
i drive around athens all day and when i get home my nose is 
clogged and my hair is oily from the fumes said michalis 
leontsakos one of the citys 15000 taxi drivers and when summer 
hits its much worse 
last july a 10day heatwave compounded the smog problem and more 
than 1200 mostly poor and elderly athenians died of heatstroke or 
breathing problems 
officials in prime minister andreas papandreous socialist 
government maintain however that a new package of antismog 
measures is producing results and that last summers high 
temperatures are unlikely to recur 
the recent package has been particularly productive

editors note it flies to more than 17 miles high out of 
harms way at three times the speed of sound faster than a bullet 
the sr71 the original stealth jet called the blackbird is 25 
years old now but it still holds world records for speed and 
altitude as one air force pilot says the sr71 excites the boy 
in all of us who love to fly 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the sr71 suddenly flashes into view 
out of nowhere like a star ship in the movies shaped like a 
dagger black and sinister it slices cloud puffs in an otherwise 
blue sky as it climbs slowly to mate with a refueling air tanker 
this is the blackbird the original stealth jet that rockets 
at 2100 mph to the edge of space as it spies on global hot spots 
out of reach of attack 
the spacesuitclad pilot and navigator members of an elite air 
force team peer out toward the refueling tanker where a news crew 
is observing a training exercise that wandered 1200 miles over five 
western states 
the blackbird the photo reconnaissance jet us air force 
officials call part engineering miracle part ghost is the one that 
first employed stealth or radarevading technology the one that 
still packs topsecret gear and was once so secret that tv news film 
of it was confiscated by the military 
its crew members who themselves were the target of an espionage 
attempt at their home base in california say they have been 
attacked numerous times by missiles fired from ground forces or jet 
fighters futilely trying to cut short the blackbirds missions 
which involve photographing foreign nations sr71s dont return 
fire theyre unarmed 
the twinengine blackbird is able to evade the attacks because it 
still holds world records for speed and altitude even though it is 
25 years old 
its top capabilities remain secret but the air force says it 
flies to more than 85000 feet at over three times the speed of 
sound thats roughly 33 miles a minute faster than a bullet fast 
enough to streak from san francisco to new york in 1 hour 45 
minutes 
a former sr71 pilot col richard graham says the aging plane 
which was designed by lockheed can still outperform most if not 
all of the other operational aircraft in the world 
for the 1960s it was way ahead of its time it was at the 
leading edge of stealth technology says graham who commands the 
wing that includes the sole sr71 squadron stationed at beale air 
force base 110 miles northeast of san francisco 
adds current blackbird pilot lt col bill orcutt i think the 
aircraft still carries quite a bit of mystique it looks like 
something from outer space the sr71 excites the boy in all of us 
who love to fly 
the pilots say it flies like no other youre so far up you 
dont have a sensation of speed and you start to see the curvature 
of the earth says graham its smooth serene peaceful quiet 
you hear your own breathing theres no weather at that altitude 
if you look straight up into space its black 
but cutbacks are planned in the blackbird program because of 
budget restraints and the aircraft may soon be replaced by a 
superadvanced stealth spy plane that reportedly is under 
development 
the new jet will fly even farther out of reach of hostile forces 
hurtling at about five times the speed of sound nearly twice as 
fast as the sr71 to more than 100000 feet news reports say 
moreover the new plane is so shrouded in stealth technology that 
it will go undetected as it careens over other nations according to 
the reports the stealth technology still largely secret has grown 
far more sophisticated in the two decades since the design of the 
sr71 which was built with radarabsorbing materials and 
beamdeflecting curves on its body 
with the new jet still under development along with its f19 
fighter and b2 bomber counterparts it is the sr71 that continues 
to collect information for the pentagon and the central intelligence 
agency 
recent missions reportedly have included flights over the persian 
gulf and the arabian sea to provide data to us warships operating 
in the area its cameras can photograph 100000 square miles an 
hour revealing the terrain in enough detail to say make out a 
license plate according to the air force

the recent training mission observed by the news crew began at 
beale with the pilot and reconnaissance systems operator arriving 
three hours before takeoff for physicals breakfast briefings and 
donning of 100000 spacesuits that include toilet facilities 
a van like those used to take astronauts to launch pads carried 
the men to the sr71 
fuel that is not particularly flammable dripped to the ground 
from halffull tanks which would fully seal only after the aircraft 
expanded in the heat of flight 
equipment screamed as it ignited the sr71s twin turbojets 
which belched greenishblue flames and 100foot streams of 
shimmering heat just idling 
finally the blackbird blasted down the runway then skyward in 
a crackling thunder that shook the ground 
some two hours later those aboard the kc135 stratotanker again 
saw the deltawinged blackbird this time over a practice refueling 
corridor some 25000 feet above southern idahos snowedcapped 
mountains 
the refueling boom operator laid in the belly of the tanker at 
its tail staring out the back through portals as he helped guide 
the boom into the 107footlong blackbird 
within minutes the second half of the sr71s fuel load too 
heavy a burden for its liftoff was gushing between the coupled 
planes which were traveling at 500 mph 
explained tanker navigator lt phil campbell were going as 
fast as we can and hes going as slow as he can 
aerial refueling provides the blackbird its global range a 
mission can keep an sr71 in the air for 12 hours entering hostile 
territory and leaving it to refuel perhaps four or five times says 
orcutt sr71 squadron commander at beale 
tanker crews are somewhat jealous of attention focused on the 
blackbird and its closeknit crews everything is always sr this 
sr that griped one tanker crew member 
but both tanker and blackbird crews acknowledge a mutual respect 
tankers have gone the extra mile in many cases to reach an sr71 
in trouble says wing commander graham 
many of the blackbird crew members are family men with the 
youngest in their early 30s for most its their last activeduty 
flying assignment 
judy bozek the 31yearold wife of maj blair bozek an sr71 
crewman was aboard the tanker watching i worry she says 
but you sort of get numb to the fear seeing him today made it 
worse i can visualize it now 
orcutt who has flown 80 blackbird missions in five years says 
he experienced an inflight emergency that could have led to an 
explosion such dramas are doubly tense because pilots are flying 
over hostile territory 
blackbird pilots say their background helps them survive crews 
usually have a decade of flying experience before they can compete 
for the program if accepted they train for another year 
even on the ground dangers persist former airman bruce ott was 
sent to prison in 1986 for passing an sr71 unit personnel list to 
fbi agents posing as soviet spies 
indeed the role of the sr71 in world affairs apparently remains 
significant department of defense officials say aircraft are still 
needed to gather intelligence because of the limits of satellite 
surveillance according to news reports 
but sr71s are becoming more scarce and the prototype photo 
reconnaissance planes the gliderlike u2s are even older and less 
capable there are reportedly only nine of the 30 original sr71s 
still in operation some have crashed others have simply worn out 
even so the military plans cutbacks in the sr71 squadron 
operated by the strategic air command out of beale and its forward 
fields at mildenhall a royal air force installation in england and 
at kadena air base on the japanese island of okinawa 
wing commander graham says he has been told four blackbirds will 
be deactivated in fiscal 1989 which would reportedly save the air 
force 300 millionannually congressional members are protesting the 
cuts 
as the era of the blackbirds wanes sr71 pilots are looking to 
the future 
asked if hed like to fly the new stealth photo reconnaissance 
jet orcutt quickly replies id be the first one to raise my 
hand

editors note a delegation from the us human rights 
commission will visit cuba this summer at cubas invitation to 
investigate assertions of human rights abuses in the communist 
country thats a sort of compromise that grew out of a meeting of 
the commission in geneva with both cuba and the united states 
claiming a diplomatic victory 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was less bloody than the bay of pigs less 
suspenseful than the cuban missile crisis but a diplomatic 
confrontation this year plainly showed the unchanging nature of one 
of the worlds more enduring rivalries the united states vs cuba 
the scene was the annual un human rights commission in geneva 
and the outcome of the panels sevenweek winter session might 
appear mundanely unremarkable a commission delegation at cubas 
invitation will visit the island sometime this summer to examine 
the state of human rights 
but that action culminated more than a year of extraordinary 
efforts by the united states to call cuba to account on the rights 
issue and equally intense maneuvering by cuba to counter the us 
campaign 
there was enough ambiguity in the outcome to permit both sides to 
claim victory 
pure gold said dennis goodman a state department official 
summing up the result 
the most overwhelming political and moral defeat the reagan 
administration ever suffered in geneva a cuban communist party 
daily said 
the session was memorable for a number of reasons there were 
cuban allegations that united states tried to bribe commission 
members in a frantic pursuit of votes and american assertions that 
countries that voted against cuba could face a wave of 
cubansponsored terrorism 
there was also the presence of a former political prisoner from 
cuba as chief us delegate at geneva an appointment which stunned 
president fidel castro he said america was allowing itself to be 
represented by a convicted terrorist shameless he called it 
the struggle brought into focus the us view that cuba has a 
deplorable yet largely ignored human rights record and cubas own 
contention that no third world country has done more to protect the 
rights of its citizens than has cuba since the 1959 revolution 
as the state department sees it there is an aggressive 
systematic and institutionalized denial of human rights in virtually 
every form in cuba 
then there is castros view there is no single country in 
which human rights are respected more carefully 
both countries expended large diplomatic and political resources 
in their campaigns commission members agonized over what they 
regarded as a nowin choice 
that dilemma was avoided when a resolution proposed by the united 
states was superseded by an alternate proposal drawn up by cuba in 
cooperation with four latin american countries and introduced during 
the final days of the session 
the us resolution was drafted in moderate language in an 
attempt by american representatives to garner broad support at no 
point did it directly accuse cuba of violating human rights 
but cuba lobbied vigorously against the resolution apparently to 
avoid the stigma of approval for a measure sponsored by its 
archenemy 
working in secret cuba and argentina colombia mexico and peru 
came up with the alternate proposal calling for a visit to cuba at 
cubas invitation this summer 
this alternative eventually was approved with us support at 
first however american delegates reacted with surprise and anger 
to the new proposal leaving the impression that they would have 
preferred an upordown vote on their own 
many third world countries that felt caught in the middle of 
uscuban political war were elated at having been spared having a 
painful choice between washington and havana 
the cubans maintained they had nothing to hide and that they 
showed their good will by inviting a commission delegation for an 
inspection tour they said they would never be pressured into 
accepting a human rights investigating team and they interpreted the 
withdrawal of the us proposal as a victory 
they the united states sustained the most overwhelming defeat 
that could have been inflicted on them said raul roa kouri head 
of the cuban delegation 
that claim seemed a bit exaggerated us officials pointed out 
that were it not for the us effort to highlight the cuban issue 
no alternate proposal would have been introduced 
armando valladares the cubanborn former political prisoner who 
led the american delegation said we consider it a triumph for 
human rights 
the administrations appointment of valladares as delegation 
head with the rank of ambassador contributed greatly to the 
contentious atmosphere at geneva 
the administration saw in valladares a symbol of what it regarded 
as the area of cubas greatest vulnerability on the human rights 
issue its treatment of political prisoners 
valladares spent 22 years in cuban prisons before his release in 
1982 through the intercession of french president francois 
mitterand he described his long ordeal in a 1986 book against 
all hope a brutal account of the systematic abuse including 
torture that he claimed to have suffered during his long 
confinement 
as evidence of torture he points to broken bones that never 
healed properly he attributes scars on his left hand to hungry rats 
who shared his prison cell he says a lack of pencils in prison 
forced him to write a poem in his own blood 
cuba has portrayed valladares as a loyal servant in the 
prerevolutionary police forces who became an anticastro terrorist 
afterward 
castro expressed astonishment at valladares appointment telling 
an nbc interviewer in feburary you have turneda terrorist who 
was arrested with a bag of dynamite supplied to him by the us 
embassy you have made him head of the us delegation never in 
history had such a shameless thing been seen 
valladares denied he was a member of the police force of the 
rightist dictatorship which governed cuba before 1959 he has said 
that cuban documents purporting to prove his membership in the 
police force were fabricated 
such was cubas antipathy to valladares that cuban diplomats in 
several capitals last feburary distributed a 38page pamphlet 
entitled the 15 state department lies about valladares 
the us delegation went to geneva determined to avoid a repeat 
of the 1987 session when a similar attempt to call attention to 
cubas human rights performance was defeated 1918 on a proposal 
by india to set aside the us resolution

many american officials reacted bitterly in the aftermath 
particularly to the votes of five latin american democracies which 
refused to back the us position 
as us officials described it the venezuelan delegate had 
received instructions from his foreign ministry to support the 
indian motion shortly before the vote however venezuelan 
president jaime lusinchi sent word to geneva that he wanted his 
delegate to oppose the indian proposal 
aware of lusinchis efforts us delegates informed the 
venezuelan of the change and pleaded with him to doublecheck his 
instructions he refused and as it turned out his vote in support 
of the indian resolution was decisive 
in latin america only costa rica sided with the united states 
argentina colombia and peru joined venezuela in support of the 
indian proposal brazil abstained 
this year as he did in 1987 president reagan sent letters 
asking for support for the us resolution to several presidents 
whose countries are commission members a number of foreign 
ministers received similar letters from secretary of state george p 
shultz 
the administration felt that over the years the commission had 
focused disproportionate attention on anticommunist states such as 
south africa israel and chile whilegenerally ignoring abuses in 
soviet bloc states 
it found cuba to be an irresistible target 
except for occasional periods uscuban relations have been 
profoundly strained during the reagan administration at geneva the 
administration saw perhaps its last opportunity to strike a damaging 
propaganda blow at cuba before leaving office 
to demonstrate that the us resolution had backing outside the 
administration the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
dante fascell dfla and the panels ranking minority member 
william broomfield rmich spent a day in geneva lobbying for the 
us proposal 
geneva was abuzz with rumors that the united states was 
threatening retaliatory measures against countries that opposed the 
us position 
roa kouri the head of the cuban delegation accused us 
officials of paying 50000 bribes for a favorable vote there were 
press reports that robert gelbard a deputy assistant secretary of 
state promised military and debt repayment assistance to argentina 
during two visits to buenos aires shortly before the march 10 
showdown in geneva gelbard dismissed the reports as cuban 
disinformation 
goodman said it was the cubans who were engaging in intimidation 
he said representatives of several countries indicated sympathy for 
the us position but refrained from endorsing it because they 
feared cuban retaliation 
particularly galling to us officials was the casual cooperation 
at geneva between the cuban and colombian delegations on the 
proposal that was eventually approved the administration maintains 
that cuba has been supporting colombias m19 guerrilla group for 
years 
ramon sanchez parodi who has headed the cuban diplomatic mission 
in washington for 10 years said one reason cuba agreed to an 
alternate resolution was to shield third world countries that felt 
uncomfortable about having to make a choice between washington and 
havana 
goodman felt the cuban offer to invite a rights delegation 
backfired on them he said that the original cuban proposal called 
for cuba to pay the expenses of the delegation thus enabling cuban 
authorities to exercise control over the panels activities 
what made the cuban proposal acceptable to the united states was 
the intercession of commission chairman alioune sene of senegal he 
said 
as goodman described it sene accepted the cuban invitation but 
said that the visit would be carried out under standard un 
practices meaning that the commission and not the cubans will 
foot the bill 
goodman predicted that the commission will deliver a split 
decision on cubas rights practices noting that an east bloc 
representative a bulgarian will be a member in addition there 
will be one delegate each from asia latin america the western 
democracies and africa joining the senegalese chairman 
the commission is expected to spend five days in cuba but its 
members are authorized to gather information about human rights in 
cuba from any source both on the island and outside including the 
large community of cuban exiles 
one of the principal guideposts for assessing cubas rights 
performance is the universal declaration of human rights approved 
by the un general assembly a few years after the united nations 
was founded in 1945 
cuba would appear to be most vulnerable on the sections of the 
declaration dealing with freedom including the rights to freedom of 
thought conscience religion opinion and expression 
but cuba comes out stronger than most other countries on certain 
other rights spelled out in the document among them are the right 
to work and to receive an education few third world countries 
compare with cubas record in providing employment and access to 
schooling still well over 1 million cubans have fled the island 
since the revolution 
in the february interview castro dismissed suggestions that 
cubas rights record needs improvement 
there is absolute respect for the human rights of citizens 
he said there is no single country in which human rights are 
respected more carefully 
ask a worker ask a peasant ask a university student ask 
intellectuals if there has ever been an assassination a missing 
person a tortured person in this country that is a lie 
the state department bureau of human rights and humanitarian 
affairs has a different view in a december 1986 report it said 
life in cuba today is characterized by an aggressive systematic 
and institutionalized denial of human rights in virtually every 
formfreedom of expression does not exist no criticism of the 
basic policies and marxistleninist orientation of the government 
party or its leadership is permitted telephones are routinely 
tapped and mail opened those who choose the slightest form of 
political resistance usually pay a very high price arrest abuse 
torture and cruel and unusual punishment

editors note in a depressed area of western pennsylvania 
where the unemployment rate is double the national average the 
mushroom has become the mainstay of the economy picking mushrooms 
is backbreaking work and some days the pickers never see daylight 
but most are grateful just to have a job 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the search for jobs often ends 
underground in this small western pennsylvania town where workers 
who once manned assembly lines now pick mushrooms in the dark 
caverns of a limestone mine 
at least we have one industry left in our area that pays a 
halfdecent wage says ray denny 50 of nearby fenelton it 
pays enough that we can get by on 
with more than 970 workers the moonlight mushrooms inc mine is 
the largest private employer in armstrong county about 50 miles 
northeast of pittsburgh where the continuing shutdown of steel 
mills and factories has hit hard the county unemployment rate was 
114 percent in february double the nations jobless rate of 57 
percent that month 
any time theres any opening in this area that pays 5 or more 
that employer almost always is overwhelmed by the number s 
its tiresome work says tom parisi 34 of templeton its 
hard on your legs and youre bending all day you stoop a lot 
workers dont talk much while they pick and soft music piped in 
around growing areas penetrates the stillness 
pickers ride to and from the mine in electric carts and head for 
a brightly lit oasis to eat an underground lunchroom with vending 
machines 
visitors from above frequently are asked whats the weather 
like 
many pickers have a spouse parent or child working beside them 
zemas grandfather began working at the mine in 1937 and his mother 
has worked her way from picker to assistant manager 
zema and parisi had worked in nearby butler at the pullman 
standard box car plant which closed in 1982 idling 2800 workers 
i made a few dollars more in there than what i am now says 
zema who painted railroad cars for pullman i miss the whole job 
period 
like many pickers marge lasher 34 of ford city says 
competition from foreign imports led to the demise of her former 
job she was laid off from her assemblyline job at a garment 
factory 
in july 1985 the mushroom company closed its nearby 200acre 
west winfield mine where it began operations a halfcentury ago 
the 250 workers who were laid off eventually were hired at the 
current mine bought in 1961 after being abandoned by usx corp ms

editors note a girl of 8 she was born with a black hairy 
blotch covering much of her face a growth doctors describe as much 
like ape skin but thanks to a denver plastic surgeon and an 
organization called friends of man monica tovar is being 
transformed a process that will take years to complete 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
monica tovar a young mexico city girl born with a 
disfiguring facial growth has been given a new face by a denver 
plastic surgeon who donated his skills 
the shy 8yearold has endured playmates taunts two operations 
in mexico three in denver and the prospect of others during what 
will be a 10year project to remove completely scars and blemishes 
when she is 16 or 17 and ready to date ill be finished 
said her surgeon dr thomas gargan chief of plastic surgery at 
rose medical center 
monica is a unique child he said as he showed slides 
illustrating how monica looked before and after the 10000 
procedure 
this little girl with such beautiful hair has impressed me with 
her courage there is something that tears at your heartstrings when 
you operate on a little girl like monica 
monica was born with a congenital hairy nevus a black hairy 
blotch covering much of the left side of her face 
gargan said such a growth occuring in fewer than 100000 births 
is just like ape skin or chimpanzee skin it is something like a 
mole and as much as 85 percent of them develop into cancerous 
melanomas 
ive never seen one this bad he said traditionally you 
cut out a growth such as monicas and you put on a thick skin graft 
the problem is that it looks like a patch the color doesnt match 
and there is some contraction in the corners 
so gargan undertook a relatively new procedure beginning in june 
1986 when he inserted an inflatable bag under the skin of her neck 
along the jaw line 
using a valve placed behind monicas ear gargan injected saline 
solution into the bag once a week as the bag expanded it stretched 
monicas skin 
usually kids dont tolerate the skin expander very well the 
doctor said she cried a little at times but she was so brave 
eventually the skin became so thin you could almost see 
through it i felt i had gone as far as i could 
so in september 1986 gargan cut away the growth the skin which 
had been stretched amounting to a large flap was pulled up and 
over the area where the nevus had been 
the surgery was extensive on monicas face neck and chest 
involving hundreds of stitches 
after the surgery monica had to wear a compression mask over her 
head for one year 23 hours a day made of a woven elastic material 
the mask had openings for her eyes nose mouth and ears and was 
kept tight by velcro fasteners 
the mask minimizes scarring and squeezes the swelling out of 
the flap gargan explained during that year monicas long dark 
hair had to be kept crewcut short 
after the year gargan performed a second graft under monicas 
bottom lip and in time he will do a chin implant because her chin 
flattened out a bit from the flap being pulled up 
gargan says more work will be needed in the years ahead as monica 
matures and her adult facial features develop 
monica speaking partly in spanish and partly in english says 
she is happy the growth is gone and doesnt mind facing more surgery 
because she knows it will make her look better 
but monica admits she would like to return to mexico i want to 
go tomorrow our living is so different here she said in the 
cramped threeroom apartment she shares with her parents brother 
and two sisters 
i miss mexico and my friends monica says but she admits she 
likes american tv and amusement parks 
monicas parents francisco and magda tovar are working at 
menial jobs to support the family in mexico city francisco was an 
administrative accountant and the family lived comfortably 
our standard of living is lower here mrs tovar said in 
spanish but we are happy to do it for monica we will do 
everything we can we hope some day we can help other children 
in addition to gargans donated services an organization called 
friends of man has helped with the medical costs monicas 
parents are now at least partially covered by medical insurance 
monica completed the fourth grade this month and was looking 
forward to a lot of swimming 
her favorite class was art she says because i get to draw 
with crayons magic markers and so on i really enjoy that 
gargan last saw monica in april when he recontoured her chin he 
also revised the scar along the left side of the nose to bring it 
in so it fit in with the crease formed by the nose and the cheek so 
it is less noticable the recontouring was to help define the chin 
more clearly 
she is an extremely courageous little girl he says what 
has impressed me so much is the courage she has shown despite 
multiple complex operations wearing that balloon on her face for 
so long and having such pain she went through all of that like a 
trooper

christopher plummer is beginning to think that 
shakespeares macbeth is jinxed as the old theater superstition 
has it 
he has a knee injury a neck injury a broken nose and some 
missing teeth all suffered since he signed on for his latest tour 
as the scottish king 
plummer who is starring opposite glenda jackson in macbeth 
on broadway for a limited run through july 3 at the mark hellinger 
theater suffered his first mishap in baltimore when he severed 
cartilage and tore ligaments in his knee he rehearsed on a new set 
on crutches for days and performed in a cast 
he lost a couple of teeth yet to be replaced in toronto 
somebody banged into me in a blackout going about 75 mph he 
says i managed to continue the performance they werent the 
essential teeth you need to speak 
he banged into my head my nose was broken for the third time 
now i have a deviated septum as a result of that charming incident 
and i developed that awful disintegrating disc on the neck it 
presses on the motor nerve and makes life miserable i was in a neck 
brace in boston i would take it off and i would be lopsided i 
found it difficult to stand straight now im much freer i still go 
to therapy 
plummer says hell go into the garage for repairs in july 
theater people have long considered macbeth bad luck no 
actor ever has launched a career playing the title role and 
thespians are careful to say the scottish play and never 
macbeth anytime theyre inside a theater 
maybe the play is jinxed plummer laughs 
jinxed or not this production of macbeth has been drawing 
good audiences 
i think audiences want to hear good words spoken well and to 
see good theater again plummer says theyve seen a lot of 
mediocre stuff it made us do extraordinarily well on the road 
glenda myself and shakespeare 
macbeth who murders scotlands king duncan and becomes king 
early in the play is called by plummer an intensely modern man 
any ambitious young tycoon and anybody in the powerplay game who 
wants to rise can understand him in every generation there are 
macbeths 
macbeths conscience doesnt last very long he consults his 
evil psychiatrists the three witches who show him the easiest 
way to power and to madness powermad people cant stop once they 
start because too many people know where all the bodies are buried 
i think macbeth is always aware that is the tragedy it would 
be easy to play someone who is mad its more difficult to play 
someone on the verge of madness 
macbeth is not as old as i am when youre over 50 vaulting 
ambition is no longer part of your psyche some of the youthful 
anger you have when youre a young actor has vanished an actor 
should be able to rustle it up at a moments notice that youthful 
anger is very important to macbeth 
one critic who saw plummer in macbeth in 1962 at the 
stratford festival in his native canada thought it was angrier and 
better 
i think he is generally wrong plummer says technically 
im much better equipped now i understand the role much better i 
think i make it much clearer 
its difficult to make it clear particularly in the beginning 
scholars have said there are two major scenes missing i take the 
first part of the play much slower than most macbeths do i let the 
audience come to me a bit and see what im thinking in the first 
soliloquy he has received the news that hes to be king i try and 
take that as slowly and clearly as i possibly can it does help 
the unjust thing about the play is that the real macbeth in the 
12th century was a good king he followed duncan he didnt kill 
him 
this production of macbeth had two set designers and three 
directors the first director kenneth frankel plummer says 
obviously couldnt see it through we were going to get into 
artistic differences very soon we opened rather shaky with only 
threeandahalf weeks of rehearsal macbeth needs six weeks what 
audiences saw was us still rehearsing at least he got it on 
robin phillips who could only give limited time stepped in as 
director and plummer says whipped up an exciting souffle on the 
stage but certain things he began so brilliantly were left in the 
air zoe caldwell came in and pushed the interpretation forward 
zoe is wonderful at bringing you back to the truth of the text 
after youve gone so many journeys out and around it as you have to 
do with these great roles you need someone to remind you of the 
simplicity 
once when he and miss jackson were vigorously discussing their 
roles plummer says somebody thought they were fighting and 
informed the news media we havent said one lousy word to each 
other since the beginning he says we get on very well i asked 
glenda if she minded and she said no it sells tickets i think 
it did

not until after the devastation of world war ii did a peaceful 
approach catch on 
jean monnet a french economist and robert schuman a french 
foreign minister are considered the fathers of the european coal 
and steel community a forerunner of todays european economic 
community or common market 
the community celebrates its birthday each year on may 9 the 
date in 1950 on which schuman formally proposed pooling the coal and 
steel industries of france and west germany and setting up a 
european common market in coal a little less than seven years later 
the eec was born 
these are some other famous figures in eec history 
paulhenri spaak a belgian statesman engineered the socalled

the metropolitan opera was so certain about 
soprano erie mills that it offered the lyriccoloratura a contract 
for its performances in japan before she made her actual met debut 
last thanksgiving as blondchen in mozarts the abduction from the 
seraglio 
in japan where ticket prices run as high as 265 for an opera 
performance she sang olympia the windup doll in the tales of 
hoffmann during the mets may 25june 10 tour she also was 
standby for susanna in the marriage of figaro shell sing both 
roles at the met in the 198990 season 
miss mills stands 5 feet 2 and her voice is light perfect for 
such parts as blondchen and adele in die fledermaus which she 
will also sing at the met next season 
it helps that my voice goes with my small size she says 
tenors always love me because im short they can usually tower 
over me 
her prediction is that her voice wont get a lot heavier as she 
gets older and her repertoire will stay about the same 
i have decided there should be four five or six roles that i 
do as well or better than anybody else she says i want to 
become known in the international scene for them 
she made that decision at her first big job at the chicago lyric 
opera in 1979 
alfredo kraus was singing faust opening the season she 
recalled i thought this guy is incredible i think he was in 
his 50s 
every time the chicago lyric did rigoletto they wanted him 
for the duke if they couldnt get him theyd take pavarotti they 
called him first for werther and faust i thought thats how i 
want to be knowing what i do well and doing it very well 
when they cast zerbinetta in ariadne auf naxos sophie in 
der rosenkavalier the daughter of the regiment or susanna i 
want them to think of me it has taken a while to find out what 
those roles are she made her vienna state opera debut last 
september as zerbinetta 
miss mills a native of granite city ill sang art songs at the 
college of wooster and thought she wanted to be another elly 
ameling the dutch lieder singer 
then my practical self took over she said i realized you 
dont make a living in this country singing recitals you have to 
make it in opera 
the summer of 1977 after she received a masters degree from the 
university of illinois she was an apprentice at the lake george 
ny opera festival later she went to the houston grand operas 
studio and in 1979 she sang the daughter of the regiment in the 
kennedy center summer opera 
until her met debut last november her biggest break was joining 
the new york city opera in 1982 and triumphing in bernsteins 
candide shes often asked to sing the coloratura glitter and 
be gay from candide at benefits 
many opera stars have crossed over by performing popular 
music miss mills did it the other way she paid for college by 
singing in musical comedies at the outdoor st louis municipal opera 
for six summers performed in the 1985 follies concert and 
record and did naughty baby on the 1987 tv george gershwin 
tribute now she seldom sings popular music but includes gershwin 
irving berlin and cole porter songs as recital encores 
the soprano and physicist thomas rescigno will mark their second 
wedding anniversary june 24 with her in japan and him in pleasanton 
calif 
when he wondered how he could send a gift she says i told him 
he was going to get hit with my pearl bill 
rescigno is from a family long connected with music his brother 
joseph heads the florentine opera in milwaukee where miss mills 
sang the ballad of baby doe this season and his uncle nicola 
heads the dallas opera where shell debut in the 199091 season 
her first name comes from her greatgrandmother whose name it 
was discovered when miss mills was an infant was arie not erie 
her name was left erie but her mother pronounces it arie 
many mills and rescigno family members attended her met debut on 
thanksgiving night 
normally i claim i dont sing as well on opening night as i do 
at dress rehearsal the artist said that night i sang better on 
opening than i had at dress rehearsal it thrilled me no end 
i must be becoming an artist because lately dress rehearsals 
havent been as good as opening performances 
after the met tour in japan and a weeks vacation in hong kong 
with her husband miss mills will sing this summer with the new york 
city opera in a new production of the barber of seville and in 
lucia di lammermoor for the first time in new york 
her goal these days is to spend more time at home 
im married and have a home life she said i enjoy that i 
dont know how some singers go 53 weeks a year i think even if i 
didnt have a husband i wouldnt do that but living alone does make 
it less neat to stay at home id say i might as well be working 
i did that 10 years before i got married

julio iglesias sold out nine shows at the 
6000seat radio city music hall and he signed autographs at a 
nearby record store that had lines around the block 
but as far as the international superstar is concerned that 
still doesnt make him feel like a success in the united states 
the native of madrid spain says success will only be his in 
america when hes listed in the pop sections of record stores 
instead of being filed under foreign vocalists 
to this end his new record for columbia non stop is his 
second done completely in english and concerts on his current tour 
include more singing in english 
another essential for success for iglesias is that he feel goose 
bumps of excitement at least once in a concert 
if i dont get goose bumps i get a very bad critique the next 
day he said 
sometimes on stage you dont reach people you feel frustrated 
more than you can imagine sometimes they understand you i prefer 
goose bumps in the audience for two seconds more than 10 standing 
ovations standing ovations can be provoked by three or four people 
standing in front of the others goose bumps you feel if you have 
it on your own 
his biggest hits in the united states have been duets to all 
the girls ive loved before sung with willie nelson and all of 
me with diana ross iglesias had intended not to do anymore but 
when stevie wonder wrote my love for him he couldnt resist 
asking the composer to sing it with him 
he came to my hotel room in los angeles with a little piano 
said iglesias who had met wonder at the grammy awards he plays 
this song without lyrics in his own way because he is a genius i 
said this is going to be difficult for me i dont understand what 
youre meaning in this song 
six months passed and iglesias asked wonder to play harmonica on 
love is on our side again wonder also played my love with 
lyrics and iglesias started to work on it its not easy to sing 
the harmonies are even difficult for stevie 
the title my love sounds superficial he said i think it 
has the most beautiful words i ever sang its the first time i 
think stevie talks so directly about this disenfranchised situation 
he means people who are born without the opportunities of others 
a latino man and black man singing together its a song to 
put people together we live in the moon sometimes we need to get 
back to reality 
were going to record it in spanish italian and french stevie 
has a musical sense of language he can reach it phonetically the 
accent and everything 
iglesias 1988 tour currently hitting 18 american cities 
already has taken him to south america china japan australia the 
philippines and korea on july 13 he goes to europe and will return 
to the united states on sept 14 for four additional concerts 
in china a twohour tv concert was aired the first there of a 
western performer 
for me it was one of the best experiences of my life if not 
the best one iglesias said 
iglesias is surprisingly unslick on stage holding his microphone 
in his left hand reaching across himself with his right hand to tug 
on his suit jacket seeming hurt when shouts in spanish request that 
he cut the english women love him 
i feel uncomfortable when they say sexy iglesias says i 
think after 20 years i proved my talent 
though he is called the worlds most popular singer with 
recordings in six languages and no 1 hits in more than 90 
countries iglesias said that two years ago he went to a 
psychiatrist every day 
i became crazier than i was he said i developed 
depression and psychosomatic problems but i went away from that 
now im back i dont need sleeping pills im ok except i smoke too 
much i cant quit 
learning english was difficult for the 44yearold singer who 
started learning the language when he was 38 thats too old for 
everything i think for a man he said 
when i go on stage now im very happy i think i can sing in 
english good or bad like i sing in english all my life 
before even when i used to do interviews it took me seconds 
to understand the question translate it to spanish translate my 
answer into english at the end of the conversation the writer was 
also crazy 
iglesias has been divorced since 1979 from spanish journalist 
isabel preysler and has two sons and a daughter asked whether he 
might marry again he says at my age it would have to be a 
perfect combination between brains and feelings to share a life in 
an emotional way is not enough now it doesnt mean im against 
marriage maybe tomorrow i will get married 
his children have lived with him for the last three years after 
living with their mother 
im a bad father he said because he has explained to his 
children that singing comes first they know there is nothing more 
important in my life than my public they have to understand i have 
a life which is my work that would never take a second position in 
my life 
they know i care like crazy about them i share with them as 
much as i can physically because i have a very busy life

when tom hayden talks about the 
1960s vivid images flash in the minds eye as they once did on tv 
screens decades ago 
civil rights sitins antiwar protests the chicago riots 
napalm tear gas 
the 60s 
hayden speaks with nostalgia some sadness but no regret about 
the decade that planted his name in the public consciousness as a 
radical firebrand antiwar protester and defendant in the chicago 8 
conspiracy trial 
he is 48 now a man whose middleaged life surprises no one more 
than himself he once thought it might never come i thought i 
would wind up dead or in jail an internal exile was my expectation 
until 1971 says hayden 
but here he is today a california state assemblyman with a 
strong constituency a husband and father whose 15year marriage to 
actress jane fonda survived the critics and now an author telling 
what he knows best the story of the 60s 
his newly published memoir reunion random house 2250 
explains his role in that fiery time to a new generation including 
his teenage son troy and fondas daughter vanessa 
im not writing it to set history straight im writing it to 
set my life straight hayden said at his santa monica headquarters 
where posters of fonda and his lost hero robert f kennedy 
decorate the walls 
he wants to put the past in order he said so he can get on with 
the future 
the assassination of kennedy in 1968 was a turning point for 
hayden he said it precipitated his plunge into deep cyncism about 
america and determination to go forward with the chicago antiwar 
protests at the 1968 democratic national convention 
i went from robert kennedys coffin into a very bleak and 
bitter political view said hayden i think it confirmed for me 
that there was no future and brought out a lurking belief that this 
was a really violent country and that i was headed into apocalyptic 
times 
police assaults on student demonstrators in chicago confirmed his 
belief 
in 1968 i thought it was reasonable to anticipate a police 
state he recalled but in 1972 the people who were running the 
democratic party four years before were out and the people who were 
in the streets were in in the next year the people who wanted to 
put me in jail began the road to jail themselves with watergate 
the radical pressure caused the reforms hayden says but 
its fair to say the system reformed itself 
in his book hayden writes rarely if ever in american 
history has a generation begun with higher ideals and experienced 
greater trauma than those who lived fully the short time from 1960 
to 1968 
hayden was there at the start in 1960 while a student at the 
university of michigan at ann arbor he was involved in formation of 
students for a democratic society sds then dedicated to 
desegregating the south by 1962 when hayden began drafting the 
landmark port huron statement sds was dedicated to changing the 
world 
we are people of this generation bred in at least modest 
comfort housed now in universities looking uncomfortably at the 
world we inherit began the statement which outlined a plan for a 
campus social movement which was revolutionary 
hayden is fond of analogizing the student movement that followed 
to the american revolution and the civil war and believes it changed 
america for the better but he knows that antagonisms linger 
the subject of vietnam and the 60s is a very prickly issue 
he concedes and said he wrote carefully about his two trips to 
north vietnam and his wifes later visit to the enemy territory 
i tried to convey that the vietnam war was the catastrophe for 
americans of our generation hayden said and in pursuit of an 
end of the war i was driven to certain extremes that in retrospect 
im not proud of 
however hayden says his detractors went overboard and hes 
perplexed by their continuing attacks on him and fonda but those 
attacks from a vocal few have not hurt him politically he says 
hes been elected to his assembly seat three times and plans to seek 
a fourth term 
what led him back to the mainstream 
first he says there was his realizaton that the movement was 
turning violent and was a deadend an enclosed hothouse of 
revolutionary politics where you become ever more obscure in the 
pursuit of purity if anything jolted me out of my revolutionary 
politics it was when the weathermen a faction of sds supported 
charles manson 
the second motivation was his relationship with a woman who had a 
child 
i found myself in love with parenting so i couldnt go along 
with the policy that chidren were a counterrevolutionary drag on 
your commitment he said the third thing was that the system 
was reformed and did work 
in retrospect hayden sees his path as circular 
i feel im back to 1960 he says im working on the reform 
of colleges and universities problems of poverty and housing 
trying to inspire apathetic people to register and vote and 
trying to reform the democratic party 
its very similart monuments of luxor egypt 
and have a final meeting tuesday with president hosni mubarak before 
ending his fourth middle east mission of the year 
shultz briefed assad on last weeks ussoviet summit in moscow 
he told arab reporters the united states and soviet union have 
agreed to continue to address ourselves to the middle east 
issues 
we will have some continuing discussions probably before long 
on an intensive basis shultz said its not for the soviet 
union and the united states to resolve the problems here its for 
the countries in the region to resolve their problems 
he added however that the superpowers have a certain amount 
of influence and if we see some things in a parallel way it will 
probably make an impact 
washington has dropped its opposition to a soviet role in a 
middle east peace conference but objects to an active part for 
outside powers in negotiations between israel and its arab foes 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel opposes any soviet role 
but plans to meet the soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze at the united nations it will be the latest of 
several recent contacts between the two countries which do not have 
formal diplomatic relations 
shultz has been unable to bridge the gap between israel and the 
arabs over the us peace proposals which include an international 
conference and trading israelioccupied land for peace 
king hussein of jordan said saturday that israeli withdrawal from 
occupied territories is a condition for talks shamir opposes 
condition and has balked at shultzs insistence on at least a 
partial israeli pullback 
in comments to the arab reporters shultz said both sides could 
work with his proposal if people will cast aside their extreme 
views their illusions and operate on the basis of reality 
the secretary said he considers the arab demand for an 
independent palestinian nation unworkable and suggested a 
confederation or an attachment to another state he said it could 
be similar to an american state or a swiss canton 
about lebanon shultz said he believed it important that 
presidential elections go ahead as planned even if there is no 
solution to the countrys constitutional crisis 
us officials have welcomed syrias military role in lebanons 
moslem areas and have worked with syria in trying to win christian 
political concessions that might help calm the 13yearold sectarian 
civil war 
there has been no sign however that the lebanese forces the 
main christian militia will accept any plan ending christian 
political dominance in a country that now has a moslem majority

sophisticated weaponsystem computers are 
vulnerable to viruses just like business and personal computers 
but experts say efforts to fight such software sabotage are barely 
beyond the planning stages 
viruses actually small strings of computer code can be 
stealthily inserted into software programs where they may lie 
dormant for months or years before causing computers and the 
weapons they help control to go haywire 
software attack often best carried out with the aid of 
wellplaced insiders is emerging as a coherent new type of 
systematic offensive warfare scott a boorman a yale university 
sociology professor and paul r levitt a mathematician wrote 
recently in the military electronics journal signal 
it can be waged far removed in space and time from any 
battlefield to affect not only combat outcomes but also peacetime 
balances of power they wrote it can strike key civilian 
targets such as electronic funds transfer other financial and data 
communications air traffic control systems and even the 
votetallying machinery at the heart of the democratic process 
their article discussed the threat viruses pose to computers 
used by the military and government agencies with a national 
security mission 
within the last year viruses have infected computers at 
nasa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
information systems on capitol hill george washington university 
lehigh university and hebrew university in jerusalem they also have 
slowed ibms electronic mail system to a crawl and reportedly caused 
video monitors in silicon valley to burst into flames apparently by 
speeding up the cycle speed of certain video functions 
tactics that can be used to disrupt computer operations include 
viruses essentially small programs that can hide in the 
computers operating system giving orders that range from a 
relatively benign message that flashes on the screen to destruction 
of data files or erasure of disks a virus differs from other 
sabotage in that it clones itself and spreads 
trojan horses programs that look and act like normal ones 
but contain hidden commands that eventually take effect and cause 
havoc 
logic bombs small sets of instructions surreptitiously 
entered into other software where they remain undetected and 
inactive until the computer arrives at a certain result during 
normal computation 
time bombs which go into action at a set date and time 
the supersecret national security agency based at fort meade 
md is responsible for safeguarding the security of us government 
computer systems it has set up the national computer security 
center at fort meade to help the military defense contractors and 
other private companies cope with software warfare and other threats 
to vital computer systems 
spokeswoman pat coulson said the nsa had no comment on the signal 
article 
michael harrison a computer science professor at the university 
of california at berkeley said the center has developed criteria 
for trusted computer system evaluation this is a practical 
attempt to decide what systems are more trustworthy than others 
boorman and levitt said much more needs to be done to develop 
effective technical countermeasures and to alert military 
commanders as well as civilian managers strategic tactical and 
logistic planning to meet the software warfare challenge remains in 
its infancy in many cases they wrote 
harrison agrees theyre making some progress but theres so 
much further to go the security techniques to deal with software 
sabotage are developing but not fast enough 
bruce shriver a computer expert at the university of hawaii 
agreed that software tampering has much wider implications than just 
computer hacking with the massive growth in computer use by 
companies its easy to understand that complete businesses both 
national and multinational firms are potentially exposed to people 
manipulating their data 
ted lewis a computer science professor at oregon state 
university said that certainly anyone with an undergraduate 
degree in computer science could go in and mess up the programs of a 
weapons delivery system or an accounting package either one 
boorman and levitt wrote that the military threat of software 
malfunction was illustrated during the 1982 falklands war when a 
flaw surfaced in guidance software controlling the sea wolf missile 
system used by british warships for air defense it proved unable combat 
situation that arose when two argentine 
aircraft attacked along closely parallel courses faced with the 
dilemma of which aircraft to 
to cope with ashoot at first the software simply 
shut down the defense system 
the problem was found to have resulted from a subtle error of 
omission in writing the missile system software 
although that error was unintentional boorman said a serious 
case of deliberate software sabotage was uncovered in the 1970s 
affecting the computer system for a major us army supply depot at 
taegu south korea 
a group of south koreans and us enlisted personnel manipulatoms of 
nicotine withdrawal although the 
theorys unproven it is possible the body uses the extra sugar to 
produce chemicals that help the brain get over the misery of doing 
without cigarettes 
one experiment at the uniformed services university showed that 
people giving up cigarettes when given a chance will eat more 
sweets than smokers however most of their evidence for sugar 
craving is based on research with rats that are given continuous 
doses of nicotine 
rats getting nicotine gain weight more slowly than ordinary 
rats when the nicotine is stopped their weight shoots up 
dramatically 
rats withdrawing from nicotine prefer more sweettasting foods 
sweetness is more important than calories rats withdrawing from 
nicotine prefer sweet lowcalorie food to chow that is highcalorie 
but bland 
female rats put on more weight than male rats when nicotine is 
stopped

what price survival of the species in the case 
of the california condor its 185 million over 13 years with no 
guarantee of success and bills that keep coming in 
that pays for land the salaries of those who have studied and 
protected north americas largest land birds captured them to save 
them from extinction and take care of them and for 
condorminiums to help them feel at home 
and dont forget 93 a day in chopped mice for 13 chicks hatched 
from eggs retrieved from the wild and for molloko the first 
california condor chick bred and born in captivity molloko was 
hatched april 29 amid national fanfare 
over the long haul were going to have to spend even more 
said linda blum a national audubon society habitat specialist 
but i think should the condor vanish the world would be a poorer 
place 
the audubon society has spent about 1 million since 1975 on the 
fight to save the condor the los angeles zoo has spent about 1 
million while the san diego zoological society which oversees the 
san diego zoo and the wild animal park has spent 14 million since 
1979 fifteen of the remaining condors are at the wild animal park 
and 13 at the los angeles zoo 
the us fish and wildlife service the condor programs lead 
agency has spent 11 million since 1979 the us forest service 
57000 since 1980 the bureau of land management 500000 since 
1978 and the california state fish and game department 3 million 
since 1979

rhode islands unusually comprehensive 
medical records dating back to 1970 will soon be available to help 
drug companies find out what conditions or other drugs may affect 
their products use 
the computerized records detailing every birth death 
diagnosis hospital admission hospital discharge and medical 
complication of most of the staes 980500 residents are 
crosscoded by age race sex and other demographics 
they will be sold to the pharmaceutical industry by health data 
resources which is expected to be interested because the real 
world is not at all like the prelicensing test groups according 
to john w norton hdr president 
prelicensing tests required by the federal government usually 
exclude pregnant women the very young old and those with 
underlying conditions such as heart disease for ethical and 
practical reasons that exclusion means that drug companies may not 
learn for years their products effects 
drugs being tested are usually given to only 1000 or 2000 
people who have only one disease and who arent taking other drugs 
its given in only one dose and usually only for six months 
norton said 
the companies will be able to study the results of only those 
drugs that have been licensed and are being marketed nationwide

the first portable lithotripter a machine that 
uses shock waves to pulverize kidney stones inside the body without 
surgery will be tested soon in the united states its maker says 
most lithotripters now in widespread use are permanently 
installed in hospitals other mobile units are installed in trucks 
and patients are wheeled inside for treatment 
technomed international of danvers mass says its lithotripter 
made in france is the first small enough to be considered truly 
portable the oneton machine can be rolled into a hospital by two 
technicians where it will be used to treat patients and then moved 
to its next stop 
we take the machine off the truck and treat people in the 
hospital said sarah sorrel director of marketing 
the first of the 11 million machines will probably be shared 
later this summer by four or five hospitals in washington state she

with insect season in full swing a 
clinical pharmacist warns that children can suffer adverse reactions 
from the amount of repellent that for adults just keeps the bugs off 
bug sprays containing high amounts of the chemical 
diethyltoluamide can trigger reactions ranging from slurred speech 
a staggering walk and agitation to seizures and tremors says cary 
e johnson of the university of michigan 
doctors often dont immediately link those symptoms to insect 
repellent because they also can be caused by infections tumors 
reyes syndrome or other problems affecting the nervous system says 
johnson 
he and deborah l edwards began studying the effects of bug spray 
after helping to treat an 18monthold girl who was admitted to cs 
mott childrens hospital with symptoms of weakness and lack of 
coordination her parents said they had been spraying her several 
times a day to keep her from being bitten 
children should get smaller doses than adults because their skin 
is more porous and they are more likely to swallow the chemical 
because they put their hands and fingers in their mouths johnson 
reported in clinical pharmacy

a galaxy next door to our milky way 
apparently contains huge star nurseries according to data from 
an ultraviolet space telescope launched as part of the effort to 
learn how the universe was formed 
the 1 million telescope was pointed at supernova 1987a in the 
large magellanic cloud for some four minutes during a 154milehigh 
suborbital flight from woomera australia on march 13 and 
identified large amounts of hydrogen 
it is unusual to find molecular hydrogen in space except in cold 
dense gas clouds where they are shielded from destruction said 
webster cash designer of the telescope a prototype for the lyman 
far ultraviolet spectroscobic explorer planned for an extensive 
mission in the 1990s 
these interstellar clouds serve as nurseries for new star 
formation which occurs when gravity pulls dense parts of the clouds 
inward or when shock waves from exploding stars strike them cash 
said the large magellanic cloud evidently contains a number of 
starforming clouds 
the telescope launched in march is the first to observe the 
ultraviolet signature of molecular hydrogen outside the milky way 
he said it parachuted back to earth and was recovered by nasa 
scientists have proposed another launch in february to gather more 
information 
supernova 1987a formed about 160000 years ago from the 
explosion of a star designated sanduleak69202 light from the 
blast reached earth only in february 1987 it is closer to earth 
than any other supernova observed since one seen by german 
astronomer johannes kepler in 1604

a technique using microscopic magnetic 
beads may one day be used to discover gum disease long before any 
damage can be done 
the university of connecticut has applied for a patent on the 
technique in which iron beads are coated with a layer of an 
antibody that seeks and binds to cachectin a compound secreted by 
bacteria in early phases of periodontal disease says dr edward f 
rossomando a dentist and biochemist 
the beads in solution are applied between the tooth and gum 
with a syringe only a small drop is required after about five 
minutes the mixture is retrieved with an electromagnetic harvester 
a finetipped probe that picks up the beads the way a magnet picks 
up filings the beads are photographed under a microscope and 
analyzed by computer to measure the cachectin 
eventually it may be used as a screening device in all 
patients rossomando says it also may be used as part of the 
therapy as a way to monitor treatment 
about 30 percent of adults will be diagnosed with gum disease 
after age 35

from the first day out on the bank with a cane 
pole and wiggly worms to those days of serious fishing with 
artificial bait and dreams of a wallhanger sunfish provide 
unequalled sport 
they also are delicious 
they can be caught on almost any kind of tackle ranging from a 
stick and string with hook and worm to the most delicately balanced 
fly rod and handtied flies 
the most common of the sunfish family is the bluegill or bream 
which is found all across the country other species include the 
redear or shellcracker the warmouth the rock bass the green 
sunfish the redbreast and the longear sunfish or pumpkinseed 
the bluegill which has a distinctive blue ear behind the 
gillcover is native to the mississippi river drainage area but it 
has been introduced into virtually every lake river and pond from 
coast to coast and as far north as it can survive the winter 
while bragging size gills are usually considered to be anything 
hand size or bigger and heavier than threequarters of a pound a 
few get to be real wallhangers the world record is 4 pounds 12 
ounces caught in 1950 in alabamas ketona lake 
light tackle is best for bluegills whether it is on a pole or 
rod 
cane poles or light spinning gear are fine bluegill tackle the 
great little fighter is super sport on a fly rod 
the best time for bluegills is the spring and early summer when 
they are on the beds males guard the eggs in nests which look like 
plates in the sand in shallow water they will attack almost 
anything thrown to them 
there may not be a best bait for bluegills but crickets 
nightcrawlers and red wiggler worms all are excellent 
many firsttime anglers make the mistake of running the hook the 
length of the worm or hooking the worm so many times it hangs in a 
glob the advantage to live bait is that it moves 
hook a worm through the body one to three times leaving plenty 
of the ends free to wiggle and attract fish 
its not necessary to hide the point of the hook 
crickets can be kept for days possibly weeks in a wire cage 
with a piece of potato or fruit or some watersoaked bread to 
provide moisture 
to hook the cricket so it will both attract fish yet be 
difficult for small fish to remove without being hooked insert the 
hook into the crickets soft tail up through the body and just 
barely through the throat 
the bluegill usually will take the cricket head first and the 
hook with it 
use 2to8pound test line with a snall hook such as a no 8 
tied on dont use a swivel put a small split shot 6 inches to a 
foot above the hook and attach a small bobber to your line high high 
enough above the bait to keep it about six inches off the bottom 
adjust the bobber position to find the right depth 
the key is a small bobber the fish can pull under 
for fly fishermen the adage match the hatch still holds 
true small popping bugs also are excellent lures 
find a tree along the bank where insects are congregated and 
falling into the water there you will find hungry bluegills that 
will hit almost anything 
bluegills usually get into gear when the water temperature rises 
above 80 degrees in reasonably clear water you can see the beds 
to find the big bluegills look in 6 to 15 feet of water a few yards 
away the nests usually cant be seen in the deeper water but a 
depth finder will find the fish 
try fishing around moss beds underwater humps near lilypads or 
in standing timber big bluegills on their beds will hit small 
spinnerbaits dressed with grubs 
in the summer fish around docks fallen trees or in standing 
timber bluegills also are found off steep banks and just off the 
rocky shoulders of dams 
to keep your fish fresh for excellent eating lay them on a bed 
of ice in your cooler cook them any way you like and the fun of 
fishing will be followed by a gastronomic delight

cleaning your fish is as easy as 1 2 3 4 5 
according to fishing experts at mariner outboards you need a sharp 
fillet knife and a fish dressing pliers 
follow these steps 
1 hold the fish upright on its belly or lay on its side and 
slice the head off at an angle behind the gill covers 
2 lay the fish on its side and use a fillet knife to cut along 
both sides of the anal and dorsal fins 
3 use the fish dressing pliers to pull out the fins grasping 
them from the rear and pulling forward this also should remove the 
entrails use a finger to pull out any remaining entrails 
4 grasp the skin at the top corner of each side with the fish 
dressing pliers and peal it off 
5 cut off the tail and cook to your taste

joe has been born again 
my longtime baitcastin buddy was standing hip deep in the 
little rapids whipping bits of fur and feather under the willow 
branches overhanging a quiet pool 
hes become a fly fisherman 
fly fishing long has been considered an elite level of angling 
its highly effective not only for trout but for bass and a whole 
assortment of panfish 
heavyduty rigs also have been devised for ocean fish that tip 
the scale in three figures 
one caution fly fishing is not for everyone if you get past the 
beginner stage it becomes addictive if you catch a really good 
fish on a fly rod you never want to catch one any other way again 
joe warned me 
knowing that if you want to get started in fly fishing there 
are two ways go to a school or teach yourself there also is an 
assortment of books and videos to help 
there are some simple tips to start in fly fishing 
unlike baitcasting or spinfishing where the lure carries the 
line flyfishing uses the line to carry an almost weightless fly 
the fly is attached to a nearly invisible tippet which the fish 
cant see the rig allows the bit of fluff to settle gently on the 
water as if it fell off a branch just above the bank 
the line which can be either a sinking or floating line does 
most of the work whipping back and forth in a delicate arc carying 
the fly to the fish 
so buy a good line 
an average rod can cast a good line but the best of rods wont 
cast a cheap line properly 
lines are measured by weight based on the weight in grains for 
the first 30 feet of line after the front taper weights range from 
no 2 to no 13 
lines and rods should match each other to assure proper casting 
start with an 8foot 5 or 6weight rod from a reputable maker 
you can get a good quality graphite rod for 50 or less fiberglass 
rods cost about half that 
the ultimate rod is handmade of split bamboo but dont worry 
about one of those until you are good enough to really appreciate it 
as you get started a moderately priced reel is sufficient its 
sole function early in the learning process is to store line not in 
use 
read your books study your videos and practice practice 
practice 
remember youre not whipping a team of horses learn the basic 
movement of bringing the rod hand forward from the back cast before 
you break your wrist in the power stroke 
when youre ready to try your skill on fish go to a tackle shop 
that caters to fly fishermen for advice on flies the adage in fly 
fishing is match the hatch pick flies which resemble whatever 
insects are flitting around and falling into the water or hatching 
from the bottom of the area you plan to fish 
finally begin your fly fishing career where you have some room 
flies tangle in branches just as easily as crankbaits hang up in 
bushes pick a stream thats wadeable in hip boots

professional anglers will tell you sharp hooks 
are critical to catching fish 
there are several ways to sharpen hooks but they basically are 
variables on two themes a tapered point and a designed point you 
can go either way but sharpen every hook one way or the other 
there are mechanical sharpeners which will produce needle points 
that are needle sharp 
the needle is the natural shape in nature if it werent the 
best way to puncture animals wouldnt have evolved needleshaped 
incisor teeth according to doug hannon who recommends the hook 
hone a battery operated sharpener 
it puts a needlesharp point on any hook in seconds 
john juranitch president of razor edge systems edge consultants 
from ely minn recommends the designed hook with three cutting 
edges which cut into the bone of a fishs jaw a threesided point 
with a flat face on the stem side of the point attacks any 
surface it touches he said 
he recommends sharpening the three faces to create the three 
sharp cutting edges 
in addition juranitch said it is critical that the point of the 
hook face the direction of travel the point should be in line with 
the shank of the hook not curved in toward it or pointed to a side

sherri houstoncombs grew up in a bass boat and now as a 
professional angler she is trying to outgrow the shadows of her 
parents two of the nations top bass fishing pros 
im just extremely proud of her said her mother chris 
houston sixtime bassn gal angler of the year and a member of the 
national fishing hall of fame 
chris is definitely a better fisherman than i am and im not 
so sure sherri isnt too said her father jimmy houston twotime 
bass anglers sportsman society angler of the year and host of the 
nationally syndicated jimmy houston outdoor televsion show 
last year was the first time chris and sherri faced each other in 
the bassn gal classic the championship of womens bass fishing 
chris finished fifth and sherri 17th 
were competing against each other but yet were not were 
always pulling for each other helping each other out sherri 
said we spent one whole morning fishing around and around the 
same hole she was catching keepers mine i had to throw back 
sherri has finished ahead of her mother five maybe six 
times in 3 seasons on the bassn gal trail but the two never 
have battled it out for one place in the standings 
it seems were far enough apart either shes ahead or im 
ahead that we can work together chris said i dont think 
weve ever fished one place in front of the other weve always been 
four or five places apart 
that allows cooperation without confrontation with the help 
going to the one who has the best chance to finish high 
we team up to help the leader chris said we had one 
tournament a few years back where she had just a slim chance to make 
the classic i had one little bank where i had caught my fish i let 
her have that bank the next day hoping she would catch something 
we do stuff like that quite frequently she shares with me and 
i share with her in practice we can combine information we can 
cover a lot more water that way 
sherri 24 said she started fishing because ive grown up with 
it dad started fishing professionally when i was 4 or 5 years old 
mom and dad have not really pushed a lot on me when i was a 
kid id take coloring books or comics or read or sleep or 
whatever while her parents fished if id concentraced more on 
fishing then i might know a lot more now im sure theres a lot of 
newcomers to bassn gal who know a lot more than i do 
i fished my first tournament a month after i turned 16 you 
have to be 16 to fish bassn gal she said in the following 
years fishing competed with college marriage and in 1986 son 
jeremy 
she qualified for the classic for the first time in 1987 
she said she doesnt feel any resentment from other anglers on 
the trail because of her family name 
most of them sort of treat me like another daughter ive been 
around bassn gal from the very beginning she said 
a lot of the others team up in practice just the way she and her 
mother do so thats not a particular advantage she said 
the one advantage she said is the family name has helped her 
accumulate sponsors a vital part of professional fishing 
sometimes we work a package deal sherri said

roland martin danced a spinnerbait to the top of 
the bass fishing world but the professional angler said the key to 
catching fish and winning tournaments is confidence in your 
fishing pattern 
youve got to believe in your patterns once youve set up your 
patterns water temperature water clarity that youre dealing 
with whatever the ph or sun condition might be you have to believe 
in the pattern and not deviate he said in a big lake theres 
maybe 100 pattern combinations 
martin makes his living on lake okeechobee the largest lake in 
florida 
once you catch a fish on a spinnerbait youve got to examine 
everything because the next one will be in that exact set of 
conditions he said in an interview 
those conditions include everything from water condition to type 
of cover water depth and relationship to deep water 
martin said the key to fishing particularly in the spring is 
water temperature he used lake lanier a big reservoir northeast of 
atlanta where he won a bass anglers sportsman society tournament in 
march 1984 as an example 
in bigger lakes there can be a tremendous variance in water 
temperature he said you can have up to 15 degree differences 
from a warm shallow muddy cove to a deep clear cove by the dam 
the one tournament i won at lanier was in march and it was 
basically won in the warmest water i could find martin said 
he won it by taking an opportunity changing his place not his 
pattern 
the easiest tip that i have in spinnerbait fishing is to be an 
opportunist martin said take the best opportunity go for the 
warmest water you can find it is generally the best opportunity 
look north for warm water 
in this hemisphere normally the highpressure winds blow from 
the south good nice winds and that normally pushes the warm water 
up the northern creek fingers of a lake 
the little creeks that run to the north are usually five to 10 
degrees warmer than the creeks just across the cove with the 
southern exposure because that water is being pushed out of there 
and being replaced by the colder deeper water martin said in 
just a quarter of a mile you can find five or 10 degrees difference 
in water temperature 
the pattern that won martin his lanier tournament was trees and 
logs in fairly dingy water when it got down to the last afternoon 
everywhere i wanted to go there was a boat i had to make one 
supreme gamble 
the gamble was to go to one of several spots that fit the pattern 
i had seen three pockets i had never fished that had boat 
docks had stumps had the right temperature of water because id 
already checked them out he said 
i had 10 minutes left i needed one more good fish three or 
four pounds martin said i motored into a little pocket there 
was a log and an old christmas tree laying there in the back of a 
pocket by the boat dock in this little warm spot about 65 degrees 
i took the jig and i sailed it over there and the jig settled 
about a foot and the water blew out and i hit the big old fish and 
hes towing this christmas tree all over the cove 
i had to pull the whole christmas tree in i reached down in 
the water and grabbed him he weighed 8 pounds 5 ounces and i won 
the tournament by 6 pounds

while some of todays highestpowered bass boats 
run at speeds above highway speed limits most boats do more miles 
on asphalt than on water so boat care begins with the trailer 
start getting your boat ready for summer by cleaning and 
repacking trailer wheel bearings it takes only a few minutes per 
wheel be sure to check the wiring lights and connector pin for 
shorts and replace any burned out bulbs or broken lenses 
make sure wheel lugs are tight tires properly inflated and 
trailer brakes working properly if your trailer has brakes 
check the hitch on the tow vehicle make sure all nuts and bolts 
are tight 
make sure the winch rope is not worn or rotted 
now its the boats turn 
start with the exterior rinse off dirt with a hose then wash 
with a soft cloth and soap its a good time to apply a sealer to 
the hull fiberglass hulls will hold water if the surface is not 
sealed 
inside the boat start with the fuel system replace fuel lines 
that are spongy or hard if you have older rubber lines and are 
using unleaded fuel containing alcohol it is a good idea to replace 
lines with new ones 
clean or replace the filter look for hidden problems in the fuel 
tank water can sink to the bottom and lead to rust in steel tanks 
clean out the tank replace it if necessary and fill with a new 
fuel mixture 
check the motor cowl for missing or broken parts then remove the 
cowl and inspect the power head remove any debris and check for any 
chewed or frayed wires or insulation 
now is the best time of the year to change spark plugs make sure 
the new ones are properly gapped 
your owners manual will tell you how to check the fluid level in 
the gear housing check the entire lower unit for cracks or leaks 
pull the prop and grease the prop shaft splines file any minor 
nicks off the prop 
make sure fluid drain holes and the speedometer pickup hole are 
open replace the zinc trim tab if it is more than 50 percent 
eroded touch up any scratches with primer and paint 
up front check steering and control cables lubricate moving 
parts on the control cables and any other moving parts inspect 
wiring harnesses for wear 
take special care to inspect battery cables make sure the 
battery is fully charged 
if desired you can hook up a flushing device and run the motor 
at home make sure the water telltale is streaming from the engine 
do not race the motor 
finally make sure the winch cable is fastened the tie downs 
securely in place and the transom drain plug locked in position and 
you are ready for summer water fun

caves are among the last places in north 
america where the explorer can boldly go where no man has gone 
before 
there are caves in nearly every state said bill foster 
executive director of the american cave conservation association of 
horse cave ky the last list i saw had about 40000 caves i 
would say thats a considerably low estimate 
what we are hoping to do in horse cave is to establish a 
national museum and education center we are hoping to help raise a 
few generations of people who understand that the importance of 
understanding the land is more than just the surface when you look 
at the surface all you see is a reflection of the rocks that 
underly it 
i would say there are 20000 people maybe more that enjoy 
cave exploring as a sport its one of the few sports in the country 
where you can still discover the thrill of exploring unexplored 
territory the thrill of exploring something that lies beyond there 
are not many other options you can go scuba diving or to the moon 
but thats about it foster said 
as a commercial attraction there are something like 8 million 
people a year that visit caves including the national park caves 
mammoth wind cave carlsbad and the commercial caves such as 
fantastic onyx and luray foster said 
there are nearly 200 of these caves are one of the few natural 
resources that people regularly pay money to go and look at 
the american speleological society acca was founded to help 
protect those resources members are cavers who belong to local 
clubs or grottos across the country 
while caves can be spacious enough to hold large buildings inside 
them they also can be far too small for a human to worm through but 
can run for miles providing freeways through the rock for pollution 
cave protection is not just protecting a few pretty rock 
formations its protecting groundwater resources foster said 
people in karst areas of missouri arkansas tennessee and 
kentucky may be drinking their own sewage because they dont know 
how far and fast this stuff is moving 
karst is soluble rock slit with cracks fissures and passages 
bacteria industrial contaminents can move a long long way 
without being filtered out its the worst place you can possibily 
put anything because it mainlines it directly into the groundwater 
system 
we want to try foster said to stop the consequences of 
poor land use planning we have very beautiful mineral formations 
archaeological sites endangered species a wealth of resources down 
there that people think are insignificant because you dont see them 
every day theyre out of sight out of mind

sprawled across the south snake mountain range in eastern nevada 
great basin national park is a large remote place where the hiker 
can find solitude in a place where the worlds oldest living things 
still survive 
located in a land that begins a mile above sea level and goes up 
it offers a little of everything found in the american west from 
mexican high desert to canadian tundra 
driving or hiking up the slopes of 13063foot mount wheeler the 
visitor can see the landscape change from desert shrublands to 
juniper woodland aspen forests and groves of bristlecone pines 
atop the ridges is articalpine tundra and the southernmost glacier 
in the united states 
the road goes up to 10000 feet to make it to the alpine tundra 
regions requires wearing out a little shoe leather 
worn into the side of the ridge are a series of limestone caves 
with spectacular stalactites and stalagmites fluted columns and 
shields 
lehman caves are open with a twothirds mile paved trail winding 
past the formations 
lexington arch a sixstory wonder is one of the countrys few 
limestone arches 
the 77109 acres provide mile after mile of back country much of 
it lightly visited 
while the visitor center and the caves get very busy on holiday 
weekends specially ive been hiking in back country on busy 
weekends and not seen another hiker in an entire day theres good 
opportunity to get away from it all here said al hendricks park 
superintendent 
the monarchs of the park are the bristlecone pines tortured 
twisted trees the worlds oldest living things which had been 
anchored on those slopes 2000 years ago when the romans conquered 
egypt 
we have bristlecones that are thousands of years old 
hendricks said the oldest known specimen is in the white mountain 
area of california that goes back an estimated 4600 years we may 
have some that old or older we havent tested them all yet 
theres abundant wildlife in great basin the most common large 
animal is the mule deer there are marmots out most of the summer 
and hawks golden eagles and other birds 
there are mountain lions and bobcats in the mountain range but 
theyre pretty elusive hendricks said youre much more likely 
to see a mountain lion track ive only seen a mountain lion once 
and i feel privileged to have seen that 
great basin also offers alpine lakes most above the 10000foot 
mark stella and teresa lakes are within a mile or so of roads but 
some are a hard days hike distant in the back country five miles 
or more and considerable elevation hendricks said 
the trout in baker and johnson lakes offer the opportunity for a 
fantastic shoreline breakfast or lunch but the other lakes are so 
shallow they freeze solid in the winter 
there are four developed campgrounds with 92 sites the wheeler 
peak campground at 10000 feet was opened this spring and about 
onethird of the campsites were snow covered the weekend before 
memorial day 
low temperatures hit the freezing mark that week 
theres no water in any of the campgrounds plans call for water 
to be available in two of them by the end of the summer 
there is no electricity and no recreational vehicle hookups 
back country hikers dont need a permit to camp but hendricks 
recommended that anyone out for an extended trip register with the 
visitors center 
part of the reason is that the park is easy to travel even off 
its network of trails 
you can do routeplanning quite easily hendricks said 
most of the park is treecovered but not heavily forested you 
can follow a ridge or valley if youre good with a map

the outlook for ducks is dismal 
there is a real possibility there may be major cuts in the duck 
season this fall 
while the us fish and wildlife service is not making any 
predictions about summer breeding success and fall hunting 
regulations yet conditions on the canadian prairies are near 
disastrous 
i guess the real story is the canadian provinces of alberta 
saskatchewan and manitoba are drier than any of our field people 
have ever seen them said rollin sparrow chief of the fws office 
of migratory bird management 
he commented in a telephone interview after making a personal 
tour of the canadian prairies in late may 
we have got to face the possibility it will be worse then 85 
when some north american duck populations went lower than wed ever 
seen before sparrow said 
ducks must have water to breed and rear their young ever since 
the last ice age the prairie potholes of the upper midwest and the 
canadian prairie provinces have been the primary duck factories of 
north america 
as farming has become increasingly big business more and more of 
the potholes have been drained the continent is in a drought cycle 
that has run through most of the 80s drying up still more potholes 
the plows which had to stay out of the water and the muddy land 
around it have chewed through the now dry weeds and brush 
we have seen the situation deterioriating since last year 
sparrow said after a good eight years of onagain offagain 
drought and some slight improvements in populations in 1986 and 
1987 it looks like breeding conditions have taken a turn for the 
worse 
last fall farmers were telling us of dry conditions they 
hadnt seen in their lifetimes he said 
then came an extremely dry winter 
then came the spring surveys of the breeding grounds 
its already apparent although were not through the surveys 
were finding a very dramatic deterioriation from last year 
although last year was well below normal sparrow said 
there are quite a few transects that have virtually zeroed out 
no ducks to be seen in these spring surveys 
ground crews doublechecking aerial surveys confirmed the 
results one area that last year had 66 wetlands had seven last 
year it had 145 ducks this year it had 10 generally the reports 
from all across the prairie are of deterioriation of this 
magnitude sparrow said 
many ducks apparently have continued on north to some areas in 
the extreme northern prairies that have some water 
theyre concentrated in abnormally large concentrations 
sparrow said we dont know whether theyre going to breed we 
just didnt find many mallards and very few pintails in the prairie 
transects 
mallards and pintails are the most common and most soughtafter 
duck species 
normally those species disperse across the prairies to breed 
when they are concentrated they either dont try to breed or the 
survival rate for the young is very low 
either way it means a very small number of ducks flying south to 
the united states for the winter 
even though the focus is on the drought sparrow said the real 
story is the destruction of the breeding habitat 
its really astounding how much the natural wetlands have been 
modified first the borders around the ponds then if the ponds stay 
dry long enough the farmers are able to plow through the whole 
wetland basin he said 
those wetlands dont recover in just one wet year 
in one wet year you just have a dish full of water you dont 
have habitat sparrow said ducks cant utilize a pond in the 
middle of a plowed field with no vegetation no cover no food 
without cover brush and weeds nests are food on the table for 
predators 
it takes several wet years for a dry pothole to recover enough to 
produce broods of ducks

this year is shaping up as a disaster for north american 
waterfowl and may focus the countrys attention on implementing 
the north american waterfowl management plan to protect and rebuild 
the continents duck populations 
the plan is a 15 billion 15year program by the united states 
and canada and a related agreement with mexico to restore duck 
populations to the levels of the 1950s when estimated fall 
populations totaled about 100 million birds 
with the possibly record drought on the canadian prairies this 
years estimated fall population could fall to near half of that 
this is the most colossal recovery plan ever attempted said 
harvey k nelson who was selected by the us fish and wildlife 
service as the plans first american executive director he said the 
plan was the first opportunity wildlife managers have had to work on 
a continental scale to save ducks 
it is also probably the last opportunity he said 
james h patterson head of the migratory bird branch of the 
canadian wildlife service said if we dont do anything we will 
just have to watch the populations decline and the benefits 
waterfowl provide to our societies will decline as well 
the plan represents a fantastic opportunity for pulling 
together the somewhat desparate interests of the wildlife 
conservation community said charles h chip collins 
executive director of the national fish and wildlife foundation the 
group charged with helping fund the united states 1 billion 
portion of the plan 
in order for the plan to be successful elected officials are 
going to need to be convinced by their constituents that the plan is 
a priority thats why it is important that people understand that 
the plan has a tremendous amount to offer to other species above 
and beyond just waterfowl 
the plan is based on a single principle to have wildlife you 
have to have habitat places for animals to live feed and breed 
it calls for buying some land protecting other land through 
easements and improving the capacity of some land to produce 
waterfowl 
although the drought had accelerated the decline in waterfowl 
the basic reason for the decline is the sometimes seemingly 
inexorable pressures on our landscape the land that has been 
converted over time to other uses including farms and shopping 
centers collins said in an interview 
despite the good efforts of ducks unlimited and state wildlife 
programs and others they simply havent been able to keep pace with 
the pressures weve had on the landscape 
canada and its provinces have taken first steps pledging 
millions of dollars to their shares of the plan in the united 
states the first actual work is to be done this summer 
a dozen states put up 1 million ducks unlimited put up 1 
million and congress doubled the pot canada is adding 4 million 
the money is to be spent in three critical areas the quill lakes 
region of saskatchewan in alberta and in the atlantic flyway where 
the black duck a longtime favorite of eastern waterfowlers is in 
serious trouble collins said 
while the overwhelming bulk of the program involves summer 
breeding habitat in the canadian prairies as well as the upper 
midwest of the united states wintering habitat in the united states 
also is important 
collins said six priority regions have been identified prairie 
habitat the central valley of california the lower mississippi 
valley the gulf coast the atlantic coast from south carolina to 
maine and the eastern great lakes and st lawrence seaway 
joint venture committees of wildlife experts from states 
conservation groups and both countries are working in each of those 
areas identifying areas that must be protected and whether they 
should be purchased or protected by some other means such as an 
easement 
the committees are also looking at other less expensive plans to 
produce and protect wetland habitat 
were looking collins said for a complete set of 
strategies a truly collaborative effort to get these things under 
way

a lot more people are cut with dull knives 
than with sharp ones 
thats because people tend to force dull knives through the 
material they are cutting and that leads to slips and trips to a 
hospital 
john juranitch president of razor edge systems inc ely minn 
has been studying cutting edges for years to demonstrate his 
techniques he will sharpen his doublebladed ax and shave with it 
to him sharpening a knife is a twostep process tapering the 
blade and then sharpening the edge 
at an old table under a live oak tree juranitch taught an 
impromptu course in knife sharpening passing along expertise 
learned from years of working with industry including the meat 
processing industry where razorsharp knives are vital 
start with the abrasive the stone or hone 
you are going to need an abrasive that will cut quickly to 
remove all that unnecessary scrap iron on the edge of most knives 
he said use a truly coarse manmade stone not a coarse natural 
stone because the natural stone isnt coarse enough 
keep the greasy kid stuff off it as it is just another old 
wives tale he said if your stone is already oil logged clean 
it with hot water and detergent 
hold your knife an angle just a few degrees of the coarse hone 
and work it in a circular motion 
notice the grind marks where the hone is grinding on the blade 
when these furrows reach the edge theyll form a burr when 
youve got the burr turn the knife over and repeat the process on 
the other side juranitch said 
the grind marks can be worked out with a natural coarse 
stone but its not necessary 
that tapers the blade 
now the knife is ready to sharpen 
the critical thing in sharpening the knife is precise angle 
it doesnt matter what precise angle you use although you 
cant sharpen at 90 degrees and get an edge but it must be 
something like 25 degrees to get a decent cutting edge your better 
edge will come with less pitch 
it doesnt matter just so the knife is held exactly at that 
angle on each stroke he said 
stroke the blade down the coarse hone like you were slicing a 
thin sliver off the stone until you get a light burr turn to the 
other side and repeat the process 
then go to the fine hone stroke toward the cutting edge with 
your edge approximately perpendicular to the line of stroke then 
you get an acceptable edge juranitch said 
keep working until the edge is as sharp as you want it then 
refine the edge 
reset your knife a little deeper into the holder increasing the 
angle between knife and hone slightly and make several more slicing 
strokes down the fine hone on each side of the blade 
if you want to increase the value of the edge more than that 
then you go to a very fine steel juranitch said 
using just the weight of the knife itself run it down the 
steel once on one side and once on the other with an angle just 
slightly sharper than you had on the fine hone 
once you have this edge you can skin out a deer or bear and if 
you have a proper steel with you and use it once in a while your 
edge should be as razor sharp at the end of the day as when you 
started

you dont have to go into the woods to enjoy 
viewing wildlife you can attract a wide variety of wildlife to your 
yard with a little planning and planting 
all animals need food water and shelter trees are a good place 
to start pick varieties that produce fruits berries or nuts and 
plant different varieties that produce those foods at different 
times of the year 
the us forest service suggests the following varieties by 
region 
south live oak black gum american holly and flowering dogwood 
southwest pinyon pine live oak box elder and mesquite 
west coast dogwood hawthorne serviceberry black oak douglas 
fir and ponderosa pine 
your local nursery the forest service or your county 
agricultural extension agent all can help select varieties for your 
yard 
birds are either fruit and seed eaters or meateaters 
orioles vireos warblers chickadees nuthatches and woodpeckers 
like mature trees with large insect populations the robin needs a 
lawn with plenty of worms 
to encourage robins and other ground feeders water your lawn 
regularly many species of birds love to bathe in the spray and a 
wellwatered lawn helps provide a good supply of both worms and 
insects it also provides mud for robins and eaves swallows to build 
nests 
if possible let one corner of the yard grow wild with weeds and 
bushes you also can pile brush or old christmas trees in a back 
corner to create cover for both birds and small mammals including 
rabbits and ground squirrels 
if you have alders birches pines oaks dogwoods or other 
seedproducing trees you can bet you will have squirrels 
seedeating birds and flowerseeking birds often need help to 
survive in the city 
princessfeather asters rockpurslanes blessed thistle 
california poppies cosmos marigold sunflowers tarweed 
forgetmenot portucala silene zinnas and varieties of sorghum 
grow large quantiites of seeds and wont become yard pests 
fruitbearing trees and shrubs are popular with birds and 
squirrels 
more than 100 species of birds will throng to raspberry 
blackberry and elderberry bushes other popular species are juniper 
red cedar bayberry mulberry pokeberry strawberry sumack 
grapevines and blueberry they will bring woodpeckers waxwings 
cardinals bluebirds orioles warblers robins flickers and 
finches 
hummingbirds are the bestknown flower seekers 
they are very fond of cultivated flowers particularly those with 
red orange or purple petals varieties include daylilies lilies 
canas morningglories petunias honeysuckles jewelweed and 
trumpetcreeper 
in summer the best way to bring birds and other animals is to 
provide water in dry weather it can mean life or death 
a bird bath a few inches deep with the bottom sloping gradually 
upward toward the edge is one of the best bets make sure the bottom 
and the edge are rough to provide good footing change the water 
regularly 
make sure it is elevated because a bird bath on the ground can be 
a happy hunting ground for the local feline population 
in winter food is a magnet 
a feeder can be as simple as a christmas tree decorated with 
popcorn or cranberries its best to offer several birdfeeders with 
different delicacies in each 
place the feeders near trees or shrubs particularly evergreens 
many species will stay hungry rather than fly from cover to a bare 
post in the middle of the yard 
different species prefer different foods cardinals and blue jays 
like sunflower seeds goldfinches like thistles sparrows and 
juncoes like cracked corn all the insect eaters such as 
woodpeckers nuthatches and chickadees love suet the waste fat 
from beef 
avoid bagged mixed bird seed many brands particularly cheaper 
ones contain varieties songbirds dont eat often it is cheaper to 
buy one large bag each of several varieties of seed and put each 
seed in a different feeder 
keep an area under an eave or overhanging tree branch clear of 
show and scatter seed for groundfeeders

american hunters and fishermen pay the majority of the cost of 
wildlife conservation in the united states according to recent 
figures 
this year for example a record 265 million in taxes paid by 
hunters fishermen and boaters will be made available to help 
finance state fish and wildlife restoration programs 
once again hunters and fishermen have made record 
contributions to state fish and wildlife restoration efforts through 
the federal excise taxes they pay on hunting and fishing eqipment 
said secretary of the interior don hodel 
those restoration efforts provide and protect habitat for 
nongame animals as well as the game animals sportsmen pursue for 
example whooping cranes the most endangered of the worlds 15 
species of cranes winter on national wildlife refuges financed by 
waterfowl huters 
this investment by hunters fishermen and supporting industries 
results in many wildlife enhancement activities that will benefit 
all americans said frank dunkle director of the us fish and 
wildlife service 
the two major federal program are the pittmanrobertson program 
which is financed by an 11 percent excise tax on sporting arms and 
ammunition and certain archery equipment and a 10 percent tax on 
handguns 
fisheries and boating projects are financed by the 
dingelljohnson wallopbreaux programs which place a 10 percent 
tax on most fishing tackle and other taxes on other gear used to go 
fishing 
in addition the duck stamp which must be purchased by hunters 
seeking migratory waterfowl brings in millions of dollars each year 
to finance the national wildlife refuge system 
a study by the wildlife conservation fund of america found 
hunters fishermen and trappers paid 11 million in license fees in 
1986 or 534 percent of the revenue collected by state wildlife 
and fisheries agencies federal payments to these agencies the 
return of sportsmens excise taxes contributed another 171 
percent 
other revenue accounted for 134 percent of the wildife 
agencies budgets that included voluntary contributions by 
individual sportsmen as well as the large sums raised by 
conservation groups such as ducks unlimited the foundation for 
north american wild sheep the national wild turkey federation the 
ruffed grouse society and scores of others 
general fund revenue was 142 percent and the rest was interest 
income 
but the study noted sportsmen directly pay a percentage of the 
general fund revenue as part of their hunting and fishing 
activities a large portion of state revenues is generated by the 
sales tax and sportsmen pay sales tax on every rod reel boat 
rifle shotgun and piece of outdoor gear they buy for hunting or 
fishing

hunters who wear glasses may need a little extra help from their 
optometrist when it comes to keeping their vision on target 
according to the american optometric association regular 
eyeglasses may do more harm than good for hunters because the 
prescription may not be set high enough in the lens for sighting the 
gun 
also the association says glasses with small lenses or thick 
frames and wide temple pieces can hamper side vision which is used 
to detect motion 
however it adds hunters who tell their optometrist about their 
sport can get frames and lenses specially suited for hunting and may 
also pick up a few tips that will not only help them see game better 
against the brush grass or sky but help them safely aim and hit 
that game 
for example hunters are advised to consider yellowtinted lenses 
because dim sunlight reduces contrast between the game and its 
surroundings due to the amount of blue light in the spectrum and 
yellow lenses filter out blue light and increase contrast 
other suggestions include 
use a telescopic sight after 40 with a regular gun sight 
hunters must focus from the back sight to the front sight to the 
target in a fraction of a second but hunters who are over 40 find 
it increasingly difficult to focus on the back sight the telescopic 
sight helps by providing a close clear look at the target 
protect the eyes from powder burns spent shell casings 
branches flying shot and other debris by wearing safety goggles or 
use prescription safety eyeglasses which can better withstand such 
an impact 
wear hunter orange because just as important as seeing is 
being seen for safe hunting

a court has fined two organizers of a 
fishing contest about 700 each for cruelty to animals ruling that 
fish feel pain when hooked and pulled from the water 
the april 18 decision grew out of a suit filed by an animal 
rights group against a local angling club that staged a fishing 
contest two years ago 
the object of the contest was to see which fisherman could catch 
the most pounds of fish in two days after the fish were pulled in 
and weighed they were returned to the water 
civil court judge horst brinkmann based his decision on testimony 
of experts called in to determine whether or not fish feel pain when 
hooked and if they suffered during the time they were out of the 
water 
four wildlife experts testified that an increased heart rate and 
labored breathing of the fish after they were pulled from the water 
indicated that they feel pain 
brinkmann ruled that fishing was permissible if fish were quickly 
killed and if they were caught for useful purposes but he added 
that simply catching the fish to weigh and determine which angler 
was more skilled subjected the creatures to unusually cruel 
treatment 
fishing contests serve no further purpose than to determine who 
has won brinkmann ruled

a travel group has predicted that americans 
will set new records in travel this summer with the majority taking 
a car truck or camper to a vacation spot less than 250 miles from 
home 
the us travel data center in its annual projection of summer 
vacations said the southeast will remain the most popular 
destination while the midwest and great lakes regions which are in 
the midst of an economic recovery will generate the biggest 
increase in vacation travelers 
cities the data center said will edge out oceans and beaches 
this year as the preferred destination 
suzanne cook director of the data center said the traditional 
summer vacation where the parents take the kids on a threeweek 
summer vacation is no longer the model for many american 
households where more women work and have less time to take long 
trips 
were finding that people are taking more shorter trips 
throughout the year and not just one long summer vacation cook 
said 
it estimated that americans will take 136 million vacation trips 
during june july and august up 3 percent from the 132 million 
trips last summer cook said the 1987 travel rate was a record 
the travel data center a private nonprofit group that promotes 
travel developed its forecast from the results of monthly telephone 
interviews of 1500 adults cook said the margin of error in the 
survey is plus or minus 2 percentage points 
the center found that nearly a third of those responding to its 
survey 31 percent said they planned to visit a city while 26 
percent said they would go to an ocean or beach that is exactly the 
opposite of the results for the 1987 survey

the sliding dollar a plentiful gas supply and the graying of 
america all may be contributing a new look to the nations travel 
patterns according to tourism officials 
with travel abroad generally becoming more expensive indications 
are that many americans plan driving trips in the united states for 
their summer vacations taking shorter but more frequent vacations 
todays predominantly dualincome families often have more 
disposable income but they have less time for extended travel 
because of conflicting schedules explains david humphreys 
president of the recreation vehicle industry association 
large inventories of crude oil are expected to keep supplies high 
and prices at or below last years levels according to the american 
automobile association which reports an increase in requests for 
tour books and maps indicating an expanding interest in domestic 
destinations 
overnight visits to national parks 40 percent of which are by 
rvs were up 7 percent in 1987 and officials predict overall 
visits will continue to climb this year 
following two years of strong showings the national park 
service is again expecting increased visitations notes tourism 
director priscilla baker 
were anticipating more domestic travelers primarily because of 
americans renewed appreciation of the outdoors as well as the high 
cost of european travel 
early reservations for rv rentals by foreign visitors to the 
united states are reported up 100 percent over 1987 by cruise 
america a miamibased rv rental firm at the same time domestic 
reservations are up 50 percent says bob caldarone the companys 
marketing director 
the obvious lure to european travelers is the weakened dollar 
because its making us vacations especially affordable he says 
but efforts of travel and tourism organizations to make travelers 
more aware of rv rental options are really paying off too 
some industry observers note the graying of america an 
increase in the retiree population is helping boost rv sales 
because older people have the greatest amount of time and 
discretionary income to spend on such vehicles and they enjoy 
camping out 
humphreys of the industry association estimates that the rv 
industry directly contributes 7 billion to 8 billion annually to 
the us economy through retail sales of new units plus another 
65 billion generated through the used and rental markets and the 
sales of parts accessories and services

americans lured by summertimes great outdoors are being 
cautioned anew by dermatologists that the sunny side of the street 
or the mountain or the beach may not be the healthiest side to be 
on 
physicians have long cautioned sun worshipers that too much 
exposure to ultraviolet radiation can hasten the skins aging and 
wrinkling process not to mention the possibility of skin cancer 
recent research indicates further depletion of the atmospheres 
protective ozone layer is letting through even more ultraviolet rays 
the public is finally taking suncare protection very 
seriously says dr frank akin senior director of clinical 
research for plough inc a memphisbased manufacturer of suncare 
products studies have shown one of every eight americans develops 
some form of skin cancer during his lifetime 
according to the american cancer society 50 percent of those 
reaching the age of 65 will develop at least one form of skin cancer 
older americans have accumulated years of sun exposure akin 
explains because many suffer from the worst type of skin damage 
our main concern at present is to halt the harm that has already 
been done 
as senior citizens enjoy their improving health in the pursuit 
of sports and outdoor activities they must take special care to 
protect their skin from the sun be it while playing golf 
gardening or even watching an outdoor baseball game 
dermatologists recommend limiting the risks of overexposure by 
using suncare products whenever spending time outdoors most 
sunscreen lotions now use sun protection factor spf numbers 
ranging from two to 30plus 
the spf number indicates how many times longer a person can stay 
in the sun before beginning to burn when using the product than 
without any sunscreen at all sunscreens prevent damage because they 
contain chemicals that absorb ultraviolet radiation 
generally akin says an spf 15 is recommended for protection of 
most skin types but during initial exposure to the summer sun it is 
preferable to start with a higher spf after developing a base tan 
darkerskinned people may then move on to a lower spf 
however he adds there is need for greater protection in 
certain cases people with extra sensitive skin people who live at 
high altitudes people who have had skin cancer and tourists 
exposing their winter skin to tropical sunlight all need greater 
protection 
other recommendations include 
limit sun exposure when the sun is at its strongest between 11 
am and 3 pm 
be extra careful near highly reflective surfaces such as sand 
water or snow 
check with your physician before going in the sun if you are 
taking medication some dont mix with the sun 
examine your skin regularly look for any irregularities 
differences in color or shading and if you notice any changes 
consult a physician immediately

since summers outdoor sports sometimes result in dislodged teeth 
from swinging bats tennis rackets and golf clubs an oral surgeon 
recommends having the family dentist construct a protective 
mouthguard for active children 
a mouthguard is an especially good idea for children who will 
be regularly participating in active sports such as those attending 
a summer day or overnight camp says dr lawrence zager of chicago 
if an injury should occur he adds the sooner the dentist can 
treat the patient the better the prognosis 
studies have shown that when a tooth is knocked out 90 percent 
of teeth replanted within 30 minutes have minimal root shrinkage 
thus increasing the chances of successful implantation zager 
explains 
however the chances of successfully replanting a tooth are 
greatly reduced when treatment is delayed more than two hours after 
the injury 
a tooth that has been dislodged should be handled by the crown 
only he says not by the thin membranes on the root should not be 
sterilized nor have the nerve or root end removed 
and while making the trip to the hospital or dental office its 
best to replace the tooth into the socket or store it in moist 
gauze milk also can be used as a storage medium while in transit 
according to zager

to share their experiences according to forum administrator joe 
reynolds 
topics included in the forum he says include camping outdoor 
photography scouting fishing hunting cycling birdwatching

the dollar fell against all major currencies in 
early european trading today on west german opposition to a higher 
dollar and a growing belief that a rise in us interest rates is 
improbable 
gold prices were also lower 
traders in milan said declining fears of a rise in us inflation 
had made the prospect of an increase in us interest rates less 
likely 
much of the dollars strength last week was based on the 
expectation of the federal reserve increasing interest rates said 
one milan trader

sunday in a radio interview the central bank had sold dollars last

winning at corporate politics is as easy 
as playing a game says dean meyer owner of a management consulting 
firm 
and meyer says he has just the game to teach the tricks 
he has developed an innovative software product called gameplan 
to help managers and wouldbe managers learn how to play corporate 
politics 
managers tend to view corporate politics as a black art 
meyer said in a recent interview gameplan constructs a science 
around corporate politics and creates a framework for business 
decisionmaking 
he said gameplan which is played on a personal computer 
simulates the political response of an organization to the actions 
of a staff manager 
have you ever seen a project that seemed logical but failed 
anyway meyer asked or another that seemed trivial but turned 
you into a hero 
he said his nine years of research demonstrates that the success 
of most information systems executives correlates more with 
corporate politics than with technical issues 
gameplan teaches the political dynamics of innovation by making 
the player the manager of a hypothetical company first the player 
selects the corporate culture that matches his or her organization 
as the player selects cards such as form a steering 
committee or publish a strategic plan he wins or loses 
credibility chips 
winning chips can get the player promoted but losing chips can 
get the player fired meyer said 
how many chips you win depends on how useful you are to 
others meyer said 
gameplan has been tested by more than 1000 managers meyer said 
we had one guy who put in his predecessors history who had 
been fired and he was fired in the game meyer said 
meyer who formed n dean meyer and associates inc in 1982 said 
the game does not get into nasty corporate politics 
it doesnt predict if a guy is going to stab you in the back 
he said it asks you to look at your job as a manager of 
innovation in an organization not just technology 
cmdr mark adams information resource manager of the us navy 
strategic systems program in arlington va said he has been using 
gameplan for a year 
what we used gameplan for was to sensitize our strategic 
planning group as to whether a particular action would or wouldnt 
work within the particular culture or industry we work with adams 
said in a telphone interview 
does it work 
it probably would have been a lot harder to do things weve 
done without it he said its hard to insure the longterm 
success but i feel comfortable enough with it to continue using 
it 
meyer said he and his associates will provide gameplan to 
organizations if they want to provide it to their employees meyer 
will also organize workshops so the players can be debriefed on 
their results 
meyer said he studied managers in more than 50 companies to 
devise the software program meyer has worked with information tools 
since 1968 he began his career at stanford research institute he 
has also worked for xerox corp and in 1978 he cofounded the 
diebold automated office program 
one of the interesting things it brings out is discussion if 
youre working with your peers meyer said of the game they 
start to battle and they get all of their political bias on the 
table 
then they identify hurdles its a way of team building and 
learning something he said

us makers of semiconductors might ask the 
reagan administration for new sanctions against japan following the 
collapse of talks on foreign access to japans chip market 
according to a report published today 
chip makers said it is too early to determine what effect the 
collapse will have but alan wolff a lawyer for the semiconductor 
industry association said the group could demand an increase in the 
existing 165 million in punitive tariffs if japan does not import 
more chips the wall street journal reported 
talks broke down friday over a disagreement about how to measure 
whether japan has sufficiently opened its market to foreignmade 
chips 
the semiconductor industry association says japan should be 
buying about 125 percent of its chips from the united states the 
actual proportion has declined slightly and is about 10 percent 
japanese negotiators say they will not promise a certain share of 
the market in advance 
we cant accept the premise that there should be increased 
market share market share is a result of effort tohri sato

a study of 1583 pregnant women in northern

among those who worked at video display terminals more than 20 hours 
a week in the first three months of pregnancy 
the study conducted by the kaiserpermanente medical care 
program of oakland calif and described over the weekend in the 
new york times said the findings did not necessarily mean vdts 
caused miscarriages working conditions and jobrelated stress were 
among factors not measured in the study 
some experts have suggested lowlevel radiation from vdts may 
alter or disrupt cell development 
the study called the figures on miscarriages statistically 
significant 
it also said pregnant vdt users were more likely to have children 
with birth defects but not in statistically significant numbers 
increased risk of miscarrying was found during both the first 
three months and middle three months among woman who worked at vdts 
more than 20 hours a week the study said women who worked at vdts 
less than 20 hours a week had no statistically significant greater 
risk

at least 4500 workers in three states were 
off the job today in the first major labor action this year against 
the timber industry in the pacific northwest 
the strike began at midnight sunday at 18 mills in oregon 
washington and montana said bill hubbell president of the 
international woodworkers of americaus 
the strike by the iwa and the western council of industrial 
workers affected 1300 workers at 10 willamette industries inc 
mills 2400 at six champion international corp plants and 800 at 
two mills of daw forest products co 
we are at a complete negotiating impasse with these companies 
and they refuse to even consider our initial industry settlement 
said mike draper executive officer with the western council 
draper referred to a tentative longterm agreement that his union 
and the iwa reached last week with bohemia lumber co in eugene 
affecting more than 800 workers the agreement was the first 
settlement in the 1988 bargaining year and the unions planned to 
use it as a foundation for future negotiations 
bill latimer willamette industries division manager declined to 
comment on the unions strike plans sunday saying only well 
just wait and see what happens 
attempts to reach officials at champion headquarters in 
cincinnati and daw in oregon were unsuccessful late sunday 
pickets first began appearing sunday evening at champion mills in 
missoula and bonner mont where 900 union members are employed 
in oregon union negotations with willamette industries and daw 
stalled last week with no further talks scheduled 
the iwa membership voted in april to let their leaders call a 
strike if negotations broke down after the contract expired june 1 
top journeymen now are paid about 1150 an hour although the 
average basic wage rate is as low as 9 an hour 
the company offered a threeyear contract with bonuses according 
to willamette spokeswoman cathy baldwin but unions rejected it 
draper said the bohemia contract the unions have adopted as a 
model in their talks restores and in some cases exceeds wages that 
were cut in 1986 
details of the bohemia pact will not be made public until after 
the ratification vote this week sources close to the industry have 
described it as a fouryear agreement that gives wage increases of 5 
percent the first year and 4 percent in each following year 
jim bradbury director of labor planning for weyerhaeuser co 
based in tacoma wash said his company would reject provisions of 
the bohemia contract 
we must be competitive with the lowcost independent producers 
that are now our primary competition in western washington and 
oregon bradbury said increases in base pay rates are not 
comptatible with this competition and cannot be recovered through 
price increases 
negotiations are continuing with weyerhaeuser and and several 
other companies including boise cascade corp simpson timber co 
and pope amp talbot

the teamsters union has declared an impasse 
with the adolph coors co and will hold an election at the brewery 
here in a few weeks the unions brewery chief said 
charles klare head of the teamsters brewery division said this 
weekend the decision followed months of secret talks with coors 
during which the union tried unsuccessfully to get the brewer to 
shrink its bargaining unit 
employees will vote on whether to be represented by the 
teamsters in order to call for an election the union must have 
authorization cards signed by at least 30 percent of the workers 
klare said the union has had more than enough cards for some 
time but has not scheduled the vote because the size of the 
bargaining group is undetermined 
the units size is critical to the success of the vote because 
many of the workers coors may put into the unit never have been 
unionized and may reject joining a union 
coors considers the bargaining unit to be about 3500 employees 
who work in the brewery two can plants a bottle plant and a 
corrugated cardboard plant 
the union wants the unit to contain only the 1500 brewery 
workers consistent with its bargaining units at other plants 
the teamsters wants to organize all coors workers eventually but 
it does not want nonbrewery employees included in its initial 
contract 
people who brew beer have one kind of job and people who blow 
glass have another klare said the work weeks are different 
the problems are differnt and there are diffent skills 
coors however has considered its brewery and packaging workers 
as one operating unit for nine years officials said 
they are together in terms of compensation internal promotions 
and other things said john meadows coors community relations 
director 
the unionization effort at coors began in august after the 
aflcio ended its 10year boycott in exchange for coors agreeing not 
to interfere with an organizing drive 
the drive began as the teamsters and the international 
association of machinists competed for the right to represent coors 
workers in march the aflcio gave the teamsters the right to the 
workers

the tobacco industry formed an evilminded 
conspiracy in pursuit of profit to blind smokers to the dangers of 
smoking a lawyer said today in closing arguments in a cigarette 
company liability trial 
the industry callously and with no remorse sacrificed the lives 
of its loyal customers charged attorney marc z edell 
edell represents antonio cipollone who blames three cigarette 
companies for his wifes lungcancer death rose cipollone died in 
1984 after smoking the companies products for 40 years 
in closing arguments last week tobacco company lawyers focused 
on mrs cipollone citing her own words read from depositions taken 
the year she died and testimony by relatives the industry lawyers 
said she made an intelligent independent choice to smoke and knew 
the risks 
but edell today in his closing arguments reminded the jurors of 
allegations he raised in the fourmonth trial that the companies 
misled the public about the dangers of smoking through their 
advertising public relations and research 
the industry formed an evilminded conspiracy intended for one 
purpose and one purpose only profits for the one part and deceit of 
the public for the other he said 
edell reviewed scientific research of the 1920s and 1930s that he 
said should have alerted the industry to the potential dangers of 
smoking 
he also went through a sample of the confidential company 
documents he introduced to support his charge that it was not until 
the early 1950s when a pioneering study linked tobacco to mouse 
tumors that the tobacco companies first started to consider the 
question 
and even then the companies did not tell what they knew he 
charged 
the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from liggett group inc 
lorillard inc and philip morris co which made the cigarettes mrs 
cipollone used 
edells closing statement originally had been scheduled for 
friday but in a surprise move he asked us district judge h lee 
sarokin for extra time to prepare the judge gave him until today 
edell cited the difficulty of summarizing complex and technical 
medical evidence about the nature of mrs cipollones cancer 
the tobacco company lawyers objected to any delay saying a gap 
between the beginning of the jurys deliberations and their closing 
statements would prejudice jurors against them 
sarokin in what he called an extraordinary remedy gave the 
defendants lawyers an extra 90 minutes in rebuttal time to 
counteract the delay but he granted edell the final word an 
additional halfhour to come before the judge charges the jury 
which was expected to be tuesday 
edell has introduced numerous confidential documents gathered for 
the first time in a tobacco liability case 
the documents come from files of the defendants their public 
relations firms and advertising companies 
he also called to the stand an addiction expert who said mrs 
cipollone was hooked on cigarettes medical experts who said smoking 
caused her cancer and marketing experts who said she was influenced 
by advertising and public statements

announced a record 135 billion cash payout to shut down two 
insolvent savings institutions in costa mesa calif 
the bank board which regulates 3150 sampls said it will begin on 
tuesday to pay off deposits up to the insurance limit of 100000 in 
the north america savings and loan association and the american 
diversified savings bank 
m danny wall bank board chairman said it was the largest cash 
payout ever for the agency 
it is paying 114 billion from the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp to american diversified depositers and 209 million 
to north america depositers 
after recovering some of its costs by selling the institutions 
assets the bank board expects ultimately to spend 931 million 
798 million for american diversified and 133 million for north 
america 
depositers who had funds above the insurance limit will share in 
the liquidation proceeds 
both institutions share the same headquarters and have been 
insolvent for some time 
prior to the closing in costa mesa the largest payout was 300 
million in 1984 to close the empire savings and loan of mesquite 
texas 
however bank board officials expect the cost of several previous 
bailout packages eventually to be higher than the cost of closing 
the two thrifts in costa mesa 
last month the bank board said it was paying 2 billion in 
assistance in the form of notes and guarantees none of it in cash 
to the southwest savings association in dallas to take over four 
ailing institutions in november it announced a 13 billion 
bailout of vernon savings and loan in dallas 200 million of it in 
cash the rest of the assistance came in the form of notes 
wall said the bank board prefers to pay a healthier institution 
to take over insolvent thrifts because it is cheaper for the 
insurance fund but in this case he said the two sampls had little 
value as going concerns because they lacked retail deposits and 
branch offices instead they relied on highcost shortterm 
deposits arranged through brokers 
wall hailed todays closings as the opening of a second front in 
the boards drive to remove institutions that have been driving up 
the cost of funds for all institutions the first front is texas 
louisiana and oklahoma which have the largest concentration of 
ailing thrifts 
in order to attract money north america had to offer an average 
deposit rate of 853 percent 145 percentage points above the 
average for all thrift institutions american diversified was paying 
864 percent 156 percentage points higher than the average 
so today we march forward in our drive to remove from the 
marketplace those highratepaying insolvent thrifts wall said in 
a statement 
the bank board attributed the failure of north america which was 
chartered in 1983 to unsafe and unsound business practices it 
said the association grew rapidly by aggressively soliciting 
highcost jumbo certificates of deposit that were then invested in 
highrisk real estate loan participations and timesharing 
investments 
it had been in the bank boards management consignment program 
since january 1987 a month after that the insurance fund sued 
janet mckenzie executive assistant to the chairman for 40 million 
as of march 31 north america had 982 miilion in assets and 
2157 million in liabilities it was losing an estimated 159 
million a month 
american diversified orginally chartered in 1980 as tokay 
savings and loan association had been in the management consignment 
program since february 1986 
fslic has filed suit against ranhir sahni who in 1983 led the 
association into what it called an explosive growth policy it 
is seeking 60 million charging fraud negligence and racketeering 
as of march 31 american diversified had 509 million in assets 
and 112 billion in liabilities it was losing an estimated 83 
million a month 
depositers may present their claims either in person through june 
24 or by mail the bank board said depositors will receive the 
necessary forms in the mail questions can be directed to fslic at 
18003476660 
more than 500 of the nations federally insured savings 
institutions are insolvent the bank board says it is too soon to 
tell if it has enough money to resolve the cases of all 500 but it 
says it has enough to resolve the 200 worst cases 
last year congress authorized the board to raise up to 108 
billion by selling bonds over the next three years providing the 
agency with total revenue of about 20 billion 
however the general accounting office congress investigating 
arm estimates the cost of the cleanup at 26 billion to 36 
billion some private analysts estimate the price tag at more than 
50 billion

makers of leadfree solder say their sales are 
rising as the nation nears a june 19 deadline for mandatory use of 
leadfree solder in homes under construction 
legislation passed by congress in 1986 severely limited lead in 
pipes solder or flux used in drinking water systems of new homes 
it gave states a grace period of two years to change construction 
codes to comply with the law 
the legislation also prohibits the housing and urban development 
department and the veterans administration from backing loans for 
newly built homes that have lead in the drinkingwater systems 
sales have been great said thomas bannos product manager 
for joining products at engelhard corp which makes silvabrite 100 
a leadfree solder that has half a percent silver 
especially in the last few months it has very dramatically 
picked up said bob rushmore vice president of sales and 
marketing for atlantabased taracorp inc which also makes a 
leadfree solder containing silver 
silver gives the solder a broader temperature range in which it 
is mushy and easy to work with 
among the companies that make leadfree or virtually leadfree 
solder are engelhard of edison nj taracorp of atlanta which 
sells taramet sterling jw harris co of cincinnati with 
staysafe bridgit bow solder products co and mc canfield and 
sons sister companies that sell water pure solder and water safe 
solder and oatey co of cleveland with safe flo silverbearing 
solder 
many of the companies also sell leadfree flux which is a 
jellylike substance that helps in the application of solder 
the law bans solder or flux with more than 02 percent lead and 
pipes and pipe fittings with more than 8 percent lead 
the environmental protection agency estimates as many as 40 
million americans may be exposed to what it considers excessive 
levels of lead in drinking water 
although lead has been used for centuries plumbing comes from 
the latin word for lead lead is a poison that in high enough 
concentrations can cause kidney and brain damage children are most 
at risk because their brains are still being formed 
the epa says drinking water accounts for about 10 to 20 percent 
of the lead consumption by children the majority comes from food 
dust and soil 
the lead problem is greatest in homes built before 1930 which 
often have lead pipes and in homes less than 5 years old in homes 
more than 5 years old any lead has usually become covered with a 
coating of lime 
lead is soft and can usually be scratched by a key or 
screwdriver however only an inspection can determine for sure if a 
plumbing system contains lead 
lead concentrations are highest in water that has been sitting in 
the pipes so people concerned about lead should let the water run 
for a moment when they turn on a faucet that has been off for a long 
time 
also hot water leaches more lead so only cold water should be 
used for cooking and preparing baby foods water softeners which 
also leach lead should be hooked up only to hot water since the hot 
water will not be used for drinking or food preparation

the supreme court agreed monday to decide 
whether federal workers locked in a dispute with the union 
representing them may sue in federal court 
the justices said they will review a ruling that limits federal 
employees in such instances to filing an unfair labor practices 
charge with the federal labor relations authority 
federal appeals courts have reached conflicting decisions on the 
issue 
in the case of efthimios karahalios a greek language instructor 
at the defense language institute in monterey calif the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals ruled he could not sue in federal court 
karahalios had worked for the institute for nearly 20 years when 
in 1976 he was promoted to the higher paying position of course 
developer 
another greek language instructor simon kuntelos filed a 
grievance with the national federation of federal employees which 
represents the institutes workers over karahalios promotion 
karahalios was not a member of the union but it represented him 
in collective bargaining kuntelos is a member of the union 
the union decided to arbitrate kuntelos grievance but did not 
tell karahalios about it after a hearing not attended by 
karahalios an arbitrator cleared the way for kuntelos in effect 
to get karahalios job 
karahalios objected to his demotion but the union refused to 
arbitrate on his behalf 
karahalios filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the 
federal labor relations authority but the union and the agency 
settled the case when the union agreed to state that it would not 
undertake similar acts in the future 
after objecting unsuccessfully to the settlement karahalios sued 
the union in federal court 
a federal trial judge ruled that the union had breached its duty 
to give karahalios fair representation although no damages were 
awarded the union was ordered to pay the legal fees that karahalios 
incurred in pursuing the lawsuit 
the appeals court threw out the judges ruling stating that 
congress intended the federal labor relations authority to be the 
sole forum for disputes between federal employees and their unions 
the reagan administration citing conflicting rulings in lower 
courts urged the justices to grant karahalios appeal but 
government lawyers argued that the appeals court ruling was correct 
the case is karahalios vs defense language institute 87636

the supreme court on monday agreed to hear an 
appealstemming from a 19yearold business merger that could 
affect the size of damage awards in some fraud cases 
the court said it will review a ruling in a georgia case that 
limited the ability of purported fraud victims to sue an accounting 
firm 
the case arises out of the 1969 merger of cavalier bag co and 
et barwick industries inc 
the owners of cavalier bag myles guykenneth and robert 
osterneck charged in a 1975 lawsuit that the financial health of 
barwick industries had been overstated 
the osternecks sued barwick officials and ernst amp whinney the 
accounting firm that prepared the allegedly inflated financial 
statements 
after nearly a decade of pretrial maneuvering the case went to 
trial in 1984 and the barwick company and its officials were ordered 
to pay the osternecks more than 26 million in damages plus 
946000 in interest 
but the osternecks lost their case against ernst amp whinney 
they then sought to appeal seeking additional damages from the 
accounting firm 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled that their bid for 
more damages must be treated as a motion to amend the original 
judgment that the osternecks had won 
the appeals court therefore barred the osternecks from pursuing 
their related appeal to bring ernst amp whinney back into the case 
the rules of appellate procedure are designed to prevent 
precisely what has occurred in this case the piecemeal appeal of 
nonfinal substantive judgments rendered by federal judges the 
appeals court said 
the case is osterneck vs ernst amp whinney 871201

for more than a century california has been 
the promised land for those who heeded the ageold american advice 
to go west but now the millions who have gone west are causing 
many others to go to the polls 
across the state and particularly in southern california voters 
are being asked to put the brakes on growth at least until the 
roads sewers and water supplies can catch up 
in last novembers local elections in california 15 of 17 ballot 
measures aimed at limiting growth won approval 
on tuesday voters in orange county seal beach san clemente 
manhattan beach pasadena hemet and san marcos are being asked to 
adopt growthrelated initiatives in rapidly developing northern and 
western los angeles county supervisor mike antonovich is being 
challenged by candidates who say he has allowed developers to make 
lives miserable 
and more such challenges and slowgrowth measures are in store 
for november 
what we have is an authentic grassroots movement said bob 
buster who cowrote a successful 1979 riverside growth initiative 
and who supports a new riverside county measure 
we think its time to fight back he said 
the movement started to gather steam in 1986 when los angeles 
voters chose proposition u as a means to slow growth by cutting 
housing densities in some areas also that year san francisco 
voters passed measure m slashing office construction in half for up 
to 10 years 
worries about rapid growth are especially severe in southern 
california where the 131 million residents of the sixcounty 
region are expected to be joined by 5 million others by the year 
2010 an amount equal to the population of indiana 
in riverside county the 4yearold city of moreno valley a 
patchwork of housing tracts and shopping centers is often cited as 
an example of growth gone awry in 10 years its population has 
tripled to near 90000 
flood control in some areas consists of crude ditches and sand 
bags many schools are surrounded by trailer classrooms laid like 
dominos to hold a student population that has more than doubled in 
four years 
the story is the same in school districts throughout the state 
wherever populations are expanding 
we are being packed in like sardines complains gerald 
silver 55 a san fernando valley nogrowth activist 
studies have predicted that by 2010 the average southern 
california freeway commuter can expect to limp to work at 11 mph 
unless roadways are improved 
already pollution levels fail to meet federal clean air 
regulations and for the last two years droughtlike conditions have 
stirred concerns about future water supplies 
its like the lifeboat that says 65 capacity says bill 
cunningham a slowgrowth advocate on the redlands city council 
the 66th guy steps in they all drown 
critics say the growthcontrol measures will mean even higher 
housing costs for california where the average home price tops 
152000 
a study by the center for economic research at chapman college in 
orange found the orange county slowgrowth initiative would cost the 
county nearly 270 million in lost sales tax by 1997 and in that 
period 100000 jobs would vanish 
the initiative measure a on tuesdays ballot would limit growth 
outside city jurisdictions depending on the impact that growth 
would have on roads emergency services flood control and parklands 
identical measures are on the ballot in the orange county cities 
of san clemente and seal beach proposition e in manhattan beach in 
los angeles county would limit building heights and require voter 
approval before residential areas can be rezoned for commercial 
developments 
critics say the antigrowth sentiment is a sign of racism and 
elitism a product of the same thinking that spawns bumper stickers 
reading california native or welcome to california now go 
home 
the people involved in the movement are typically well 
ensconsed and have their piece of the american dream said john 
erskine executive director of the orange county building industry 
association 
pasadenas responsible growth initiative or proposition g 
does less to stop growth and more to direct it it asks that 
developments of 25000 square feet or 25 units be approved 
unanimously by the citys directors for the next two years and 
requires that developers pick up the tab for sewers and road 
improvements and dedicate land or fees for parks 
measure c in the riverside county farm town of hemet also would 
require developers rather than taxpayers to pay for growth as would 
proposition r in the san diego county city of san marcos

court to reexamine its 1986 ruling that an ohio law regulating 
corporate takeovers is unconstitutional 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled 21 that us district judge john holschuh of columbus should 
review whether his 1986 ruling is still valid 
although the 6th circuit court upheld holschuhs ruling later 
that year the us supreme court overturned it in 1987 and sent it 
back to the 6th circuit for reconsideration 
lawyers representing ohio contend that holschuhs decision still 
leaves in question whether the states takeover law is valid 
on monday a majority of the 6th circuit courts threejudge 
panel decided holschuhs court is the proper forum for the review 
in a minority dissent appeals judge cornelia kennedy said she would 
have upheld holschuhs ruling that ohios law enacted in 1982 
illegally conflicts with provisions of the williams act a federal 
law governing tender offers 
the ohio law known formally as the ohio control share 
acquisition act forbids a suitor from acquiring more than 20 
percent of a companys stock without the approval of its 
shareholders 
holschuhs 1986 ruling came in a lawsuit brought by fleet 
aerospace corp a canadian aerospace company that used its 
challenge of the ohio law to successfully take over aeronca inc of 
charlotte nc a commercial and military subcontractor that 
operates an aerospace division based in middletown ohio 
aeronca initially fought the takeover but ultimately agreed to an 
improved bid and now operates as a subsidiary of fleet aerospace 
lawyers for fleet aerospace now argue that the case is moot 
because the takeover has been completed and is successful but 
lawyers for ohio which appealed holschuhs ruling want the case 
kept alive they argue that ohio has a legitimate interest in seeing 
that its laws are constitutional and that it be allowed to enforce 
them 
ohios lawyers say the law is a legitimate way of letting the 
state regulate potential takeovers of ohio corporations and also 
protect ohio shareholders who buy stock in outofstate companies 
that become takeover targets

the hot dry weather scorching the midwest sent grain and soybean 
futures prices surging monday by the maximum amount permitted for a 
single day on the chicago board of trade 
soybeans advanced by the daily limit of 30 cents a bushel for the 
second consecutive session bringing the july contract to 879 the 
highest level in four years 
all six major agricultural futures on the board of trade were up 
the limit for the first time in a decade or more the exchange said 
on other markets live cattle and pork futures moved sharply 
higher cotton was up the limit coffee advanced and energy futures 
declined 
with the continuing lack of moisture in the midwest soybeans 
have gained 111 a bushel in the past week 
its a ferocious weather market said trader victor 
lespinasse with dean witter reynolds inc 
and not much improvement is in sight after the close of trading 
monday the national weather service released its 6 to 10day 
forecast predicting continued warm and dry conditions 
lespinasse said tens of thousands of buy orders languished at the 
board of trade with only few sellers surfacing the expectations 
were for sharp price advances again on tuesday 
because of two consecutive sessions with limit gains daily 
trading limits are expanded on tuesday to 45 cents a bushel for 
beans 15 cents a bushel for corn and oats and 15 a ton for meal 
wheat settled 20 cents higher with the contract for delivery in 
july at 382 a bushel corn was 10 cents higher with july at 
244 a bushel oats were 10 cents higher with july at 206 a 
bushel and soybeans were 30 cents higher with july at 879 cents a 
bushel 
the sharp rise in grains and beans was felt in other markets as 
well live cattle and pork futures posted sharp gains at the chicago 
mercantile exchange while most cotton contracts were up the limit 
at the cotton exchange in new york 
the limit up grain prices had a lot to do with supporting the 
distant deliveries of cattle said philip stanley an analyst 
with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
he said the hot weather gave a direct boost to the nearby 
contracts of cattle and hogs because of a reluctance to move the 
animals to market in the heat 
and there may be some liquidation of the cattle breeding herd 
and of sows he said higher grain prices mean more expensive feed 
and lower profits 
live cattle were 57 cent to the limit 150 cents higher with the 
june contract at 7322 cents a pound feeder cattle were 80 cent 
lower to 15 cent higher with august at 7517 cents a pound live 
hogs were 50 cent to the limit 150 cents higher with june at 5295 
cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 57 cent to 185 cents 
higher with july at 5612 cents a pound 
cotton futures prices rose the limit continuing a trend of that 
commodity following soybean prices said ernest simon cotton 
specialist with prudentialbache securities inc 
it doesnt make any sense since we have absolutely no problem 
with cotton theres no weather stress its too early he said 
cotton settled 196 to the limit 2 cents higher with july at 
6834 cents a pound 
a light frost in brazilian coffee growing regions sent futures 
higher on the coffee exchange in new york 
the uncertainty of how much damage was done if any kept 
prices firm much of the day said sandra kaul an analyst in new 
york with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the buds on the 198990 crop are beginning to develop and a frost 
can make them drop off she said adding however that most buds 
wont form until after midjune 
coffee settled 132 cents to 257 cents higher with july at 
13747 cents a pound 
energy futures tumbled on the new york mercantile exchange led 
by sharp losses in gasoline and heating oil 
most of the weakness was due to technical market factors said 
peter beutel an analyst in new york with elders futures inc 
also he said there not much expectation that opec will 
accomplish anything constructive at its ministerial meeting saturday 
in vienna 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents to 39 cents 
lower with july at 1726 a barrel heating oil was 103 cents to 
129 cents lower with july at 4584 cents a gallon and unleaded 
gasoline was 104 cents to 116 cents lower with july at 4973 cents 
a gallon 
precious metals futures were mixed on the commodity exchange in 
new york 
gold settled 100 to 190 lower with the june contract at 
46290 a troy ounce and silver was 44 cents to 45 cents higher 
with june at 727 a troy ounce

the nations efficiency in churning out goods 
and services improved more than four times more rapidly during the 
first quarter of 1988 than it did in 1987 the government said 
monday 
but average annualized hourly wage gains of only 34 percent 
failed to put most workers ahead of inflation for the fifth quarter 
in a row the labor department said 
not since the spriraling inflation of 197981 have workers gone 
that long without an improvement in their standard of living through 
wage gains according to the bureau of labor statistics 
productivity the biggest single indicator of us 
competitiveness increased among the nations nonfarm businesses 
at an annual rate of 36 percent during january through march the 
labor department said in revised statistics for the quarter 
preliminary figures last month had put the improvement at only 
09 percent or roughly equal to the 08 gain for all of 1987 but 
those earlier figures were issued before the gross national product 
the broadest measure of economic growth was revised upward from 
23 percent to 39 percent annually for the quarter 
output of goods and services among nonfarm businesses which are 
responsible for threefourths of the nations economic activity 
grew at a much healthier 59 percent the labor department said 
more than double the earlier growth estimate of 27 percent 
to achieve the higher output businesses increased their total 
employee hours by only 22 percent up from an earlier estimate of 
17 percent 
its quite an impressive result but probably near the last of 
the good news were going to get on productivity said allen 
sinai chief economist for the boston co a new york economic 
consulting firm from here on it gets tougher as we approach full 
employment and the last workers hired are the least productive 
the 34 percent average annual wage gain for the quarter sent the 
labor costs associated with each good or service down by 02 
percent compared with a 2 percent increase in labor costs in 1987 
however nonlabor costs profits rent capital and indirect 
taxes associated with each unit of output rose 11 percent 
after taking into account inflation as measured by the consumer 
price index workers saw no increase in their buying power through 
their pay raises the government said 
not since the last quarter of 1986 when inflation for the year 
was only 2 percent have workers seen an increase in their real 
wages in 1987 their buying power actually declined by almost 1 
percent 
only twice before since world war ii once in 197980 and again 
in 198081 have workers gone 15 months without an increase in 
their standard of living the labor department said 
factory workers fared better hourly wages in manufacturing 
industries rose at an annual rate of 46 percent in the first 
quarter the biggest increase since a 51 percent annualized boost 
the last quarter of 1985 
the higher wages compared with a 39 percent increase in the 
preliminary estimate and a 13 percent increase for all of 1987 
raised the labor costs associated with each item coming off the 
nations assembly lines by 17 percent annually instead of 1 percent 
reported earlier 
it also gave factory workers their first real wage gain 12 
percent after inflation since 1985 in 1987 the real or 
inflationadjusted income of manufacturing workers fell by 22 
percent 
wage costs are clearly accelerating and were already running 
into labor cost problems on the manufacturing side said sinai 
workers have tolerated a long erosion in real wages partly 
because of tax cuts and a willingness to work more hours to support 
their consumption 
but that string is running out he said the result will be 
more inflation and a weakening of manufacturing profits 
meanwhile improvements in manufacturing productivity continued 
on its 1987 pace of 28 percent annually through the first quarter 
manufacturing output according to the revised figures was 45 
percent higher than the fourth quarter of 1987 with workers putting 
in a total of only 16 percent more hours to achieve it 
the higher factory wages however raised the labor costs 
associated with each item coming off the nations assembly lines by 
17 percent annually instead of 1 percent reported earlier those 
unit labor costs had fallen by 15 percent in 1987

the cleveland works is the largest flat rolled steel complex in

steelmakers in the us japan korea and europe said david h 
hoag ltv steels president and chief executive officer 
the proposed sevenyear modernization would include construction 
of a facility to produce ultralow carbon steels and the renovation

includes the renovation of three blast furnaces and improvements to 
the 84inch rolling complex

the finance ministry said monday brazil 
had closed a 4 billion agreement for new loans with international 
bankers in new york after lengthy negotiations on the countrys 121 
billion foreign debt 
in new york a spokesman for the 14member bank committee said it 
had a rule of not commenting on the negotiations and issued no 
statement on the announcement by brazilian finance minister mailson 
da nobrega but knowledgeable bank sources who requested anonymity 
said that some pending issues remained unresolved and that 
negotiations were continuing monday with brazilian representatives 
in new york 
da nobrega at a news conference in brasilia said the new 
agreement was not linked with an accord with the international 
monetary fund 
brazils two main debt negotiators cut off talks two weeks ago 
over the issue of whether or not the imf had to give the green light 
before creditors would sign an agreement with brazil 
da nobrega said the committee of 14 banks in new york 
representing brazils 700 creditors found the agreement acceptable 
together we are finding a solution to the debt da nobrega 
said 
under the agreement he said brazil will receive 4 billion in 
new bank loans now plus 600 million later in 1988 and another 600 
million in 1989 for a total of 52 billion 
he said the 1989 payment was subject to brazil meeting the goals 
set by the countrys imfapproved economic program da nobrega said 
however that this accord has not yet been signed because of legal 
details 
in february 1987 brazil suspended its 1 billion monthly debt 
payments saying the country was broke inflation was running at a 
1000 percent annual rate the trade surplus had tumbled from 1 
billion to 1 million a month and currency reserves had dipped 
below 4 billion 
in january of this year brazil resumed payments but said it 
would only officially suspend the moratorium after an agreement with 
creditors 
a sticking point in negotiations between brazil and creditors 
since 1986 has been imf approval of the countrys economic programs 
brazil argues that the imf policies are recessionary and impinge 
upon its national sovereignty 
since early this year however brazil has eased its criticisms 
of the imf and agreed to monitoring by that institution for 
political reasons brazil does not want an imf goahead linked to 
new loans political analysts have said

the move by federal regulators monday to shut 
down two orange county calif savings and loans and pay a record 
135 billion to depositors renewed attention on the large number of 
recent sampl failures in california 
since 1984 a total of 31 california sampls have come under 
receivership or conservatorship by state or federal regulators 
according to the california department of savings and loan 
the laws are still there to make it legal to get in trouble 
said state savings and loan commissioner william j crawford i 
dont know how you insure against it 
crawford who has been urging reform of laws for the industry 
sees little progress in that direction 
were still waiting for some college professor to be 
commissioned to make a study to tell us what to do he said 
the federal home loan bank board acted against american 
diversified savings bank and north america savings and loan both 
based in costa mesa calif 
the action included a rare decision by the board to make straight 
payments rather than arranging a takeover by another institution 
a year ago crawford testified before a house subcommittee that 
fraud was a factor in most of the states sampl failures members of 
the consumer and monetary affairs subcommittee of the house 
committee on government operations held hearings because of the 
extent of savings and loan failures in california 
crawford testified that deregulation of the industry during the 
early 1980s precipitated extensive growth in sometimes risky lines 
of business and at the same time removed much of the traditional 
protection for depositors 
both diversified savings bank and north america savings and loan 
were founded in 1983 
bank board chairman m danny wall said the two thrifts had had 
few retail deposits lacked branch offices and relied on highcost 
shortterm deposits arranged through brokers which they in turn 
lent out for speculative real estate ventures and other risky 
investments 
the cases of the two institutions were similar to another orange 
county sampl consolidated savings bank of irvine which was founded 
in 1984 and liquidated in 1986 three months after it was seized by 
regulators 
american diversifed and north america savings were two of six 
orange county savings and loans operating under the federal savings 
and loan insurance corporations management consignment program 
as of last october 
crawford the bluntspoken sampl commissioner offered a simple 
explanation for the clustering in orange county 
theres a lot of affluent people in orange county affluent 
people get charters affluent people invest in real estate crooks 
like to get close to money he said 
where would you go would you go to south central los angeles 
to get people to invest in your project you wouldnt if you want 
to get money you need to locate in beverly hills or orange 
county 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp is sending mailgrams 
to the two sampls depositors with forms and information they need to 
claim their deposits

the federal reserve board on monday approved 
applications from two japanese banks to acquire us firms that are 
primary dealers in government securities 
the fed is permitting sanwa bank ltd of osaka japan to 
purchase brophy gestal knight amp co of new york and longterm 
credit bank of japan based in tokyo to buy greenwich capital 
markets inc of greenwich conn 
sanwa with assets of 324 billion is the fifthlargest banking 
organization in the world longterm credit with about 185 billion 
in assets is the 21stlargest 
when the federal reserve sells or buys government securities as a 
means of tightening or loosening the nations money supply it does 
so through the federal reserve bank of new york which deals 
exclusively with about 40 firms which are designated as primary 
dealers 
large institutional investors then buy and sell government 
securities through the primary dealers 
there are already japaneseowned primary dealers but the 
approval of the latest applications comes as congress is considering 
legislation that would have the effect of barring the fed from 
designating japaneseowned firms as primary dealers it is a move 
aimed at pressuring japan into allowing us firms greater access to 
its markets 
however the fed argued in its approval order that the japanese 
banks entry into the market will increase the competition among 
primary dealers thus enhancing customer convenience and efficiency 
one section of the trade bill passed by congress but vetoed by 
president reagan last month prohibits the fed from allowing 
foreignowned securities firms to serve as primary dealers unless 
the foreign country grants corresponding privileges to us firms 
the trade bill would delay the effective date of the legislation 
for one year in order to give foreign governments time to grant 
access to us firms before the foreign firms would lose that 
privilege in the united states 
in addition primary dealers would be exempt from the new 
restrictions if they were purchased by foreign interests prior to 
july 31 1987 or if they notified the fed of an impending purchase 
prior to that date 
the fed noted that both sanwa and longterm have met that 
deadline

bieber traded lighthearted barbs during the signing ceremony top 
negotiators and bargaining team members signed the settlement 
agreements covering production maintenance parts office 
technical and clerical workers 
its a good contract one that were extremely happy with one 
that provides some benefits and protection from a job security 
standpoint bieber said and i think the fact that we were able 
to put it together early ought to speak well for future 
negotiations 
greenwald said we had had a bit of a bumpy ride preceding 
these national contract negotiations 
nevertheless between the union and chrysler we have been able 
to achieve an early contract agreement which means that all of us 
are now able to concentrate on our equal goals of quality and 
productivity without any concern of work interruption that would 
have otherwise taken place under a september deadline the auto 
executive said 
the contract has been in effect since may 16 when it replaced a 
threeyear agreement that would have expired sept 14 
the new contract expires in september 1990 the same time as 
agreements between the uaw and general motors corp and ford motor 
co gm and ford reached agreements with the uaw last fall 
the contract guarantees a set number of jobs at each chrysler

workers received a 1000 signing bonus and will have profit 
sharing in future years uaw chrysler vice president mark stepp said 
one of the chief gains of the bargaining was chryslers unsolicited 
promise to withhold executive bonuses in years when workers fail to 
qualify for profitsharing 
we got a foot in the door with this agreement the kind of 
antagonism and the kind of ill feeling against excessive 
compensation will fade in the future stepp said 
the no 3 automaker and the uaw began early negotiations april 18 
as a way to cool rising tensions brought on by chryslers 
consideration of a 2 billion offer for its 28000worker acustar 
inc parts subsidiary and the companys decision to close a 
5500worker assembly plant in kenosha wis 
the tentative agreement was reached may 4 and eliminated the 
possibility of a strike in september which some felt was likely 
because of the anger of rankandfile workers over the proposed 
acustar sale and the kenosha closing 
bieber said he was unconcerned by the relatively small margin by 
which the contract was approved he said the turmoil during 
negotiations and the fact that 50 percent of the rankandfile 
failed to cast votes during the ratification process contributed to 
the 54 percent approval

gillette co had discussions with at least two 
potential suitors this year and one in 1987 even though it told 
stockholders during a proxy fight that no one was interested in 
buying the company a new yorkbased investment firm charged in 
court documents made public monday 
coniston group which has been involved in a long and bitter 
battle to gain control of gillette also accused the personal care 
giant of paying greenmail to avoid a hostile 1986 takeover bid by 
revlon group inc 
gillette admitted in court documents that it held discussions 
with one company in september 1987 and others this year but denied 
they involved talk of a possible takeover 
the allegations were made in a countersuit filed by coniston in 
federal court in april charging gillette with misrepresenting facts 
in legal action and in material sent to stockholders before a proxy 
vote that month 
gillette sued coniston for allegedly failing to disclose all its 
financial backers before the proxy vote in april in which 
shareholders rejected conistons attempt to gain control of 
onethird of gillettes board of directors 
us district judge rya zobel placed the countersuit and other 
documents under seal but made them public monday after she reviewed 
them the trial in the lawsuits is scheduled to start next monday 
in its countersuit coniston charges that gillette 
signed confidentiality agreements in november 1986 with nine 
potential white knights interested in buying the company in the 
agreements gillette gave the companies access to confidential 
information in exchange for a promise not to buy gillette securities 
without company approval for two years 
paid greenmail when it bought revlons more than 9 million 
shares of gillette stock in november 1986 at 5950 a share or 
3125 a share above market price to avoid a hostile takeover

lambert inc in exchange for a promise not to arrange or provide 
financing for purchase of gillette securities for three years 
hired a private investigator to research coniston members 
dealings around the world 
presented to stockholders misleadingly favorable earnings 
projections 
in its 31page pointbypoint response gillette charges that 
conistons claim is repetitive and irrelevant and a tool in 
the coniston groups public relations campaign against gillette 
gillette called the agreements with the nine companies standard 
procedure denied they were suitors denied paying greenmail to 
revlon and charged that coniston painted the dealings in a 
blatantly false and miseleading manner in attempt to mislead 
stockholders 
coniston mischaracterizes totally the nature of the 
communications gillette spokesman david fausch said gillette 
was approached by certain parties who were merely inquiring whether 
the company had any interest in discussing certain types of 
transactions 
the interests were not attractive to gillette and the 
inquiries were not sufficiently concrete or detailed to warrant 
action he said 
at its april 21 annual meeting gillette shareholders rejected by 
52 percent to 48 percent conistons slate of four candidates for the 
12member gillette board 
coniston which controls about 58 percent of gillette shares 
launched a proxy battle in february and pledged to convince the 
other eight directors to sell bostonbased gillette if its 
candidates were elected

about 4500 union workers walked off their 
jobs monday at lumber mills and plywood plants in the pacific 
northwest in a showdown over efforts to restore wages and benefits 
lost two years ago 
the strike shut down 18 wood products operations in oregon 
washington and montana willamette industries inc of portland 
champion international corp of stamford conn and daw forest 
products co of lake oswego were affected by the walkout 
the surprise walkout followed the collapse last week of talks 
between the three companies and two unions the international 
woodworkers of americaus and the western council of industrial 
workers both based in portland 
the unions have vowed to win restoration of wages and benefits 
lost in 1986 after a series of unsuccessful strikes 
the first step toward restoration was taken last week when the 
unions announced a tentative agreement with bohemia inc of eugene 
union officials said the fouryear pact largely restored wages lost 
two years ago 
the unions want to use the bohemia agreement as an industry 
standard but other companies so far have rejected it 
dennis elder a spokesman for champion in milltown mont said 
his company did not think the bohemia agreement represents a 
standard for the wood products industry 
talks broke down friday after champion made a counterproposal 
but elder said the company was ready to go back to the bargaining 
table 
this is a strike that did not have to happen he said 
talks with willamette also broke down after the companys 
counterproposal was rejected said spokeswoman cathy baldwin 
weve expressed a willingness to meet any time theyre willing 
to meet and bargain and compromise she said 
the two unions represent about 1300 workers at five lumber 
mills four plywood mills two wood products plants a machine shop 
and a logging shop operated by willamette in lebanon sweet home 
dallas and albany ore 
the iwa bargains for 450 workers at champions roseburg ore 
plywood plant the wciw represents about 200 champion workers at a 
klickitat wash sawmill and 1800 champion workers at sawmills 
and plywood plants at missoula bonner and libby mont 
contracts at klickitat and libby expire later this summer but 
workers stayed out monday honoring picket lines set up by workers 
from other mills 
members of both unions voted overwhelmingly a month ago to 
authorize their negotiators to call strikes if necessary 
elder and baldwin said their companies had no immediate plans to 
reopen their operations 
baldwin said willamettes threeyear offer included bonuses the 
first two years and a 35 percent wage increase the third year 
the average plywood worker making 977 per hour would gross an 
additional 2777 over the life of the contract she said 
elder declined to discuss champions last offer 
union leaders oppose bonuses because the base wage rate remains 
the same although annual wages are boosted
