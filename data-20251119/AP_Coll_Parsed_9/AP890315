electrical installation and on tuesday bombed filling stations 
tens of thousands of leftists suspected leftists and other 
presumed government opponents have been killed in el salvador during 
this decade the united states and international organizations have 
described the killings as massive human rights abuses by the 
military and farright death squads 
most observers say the big question is whether there will be a 
runoff between arena and the christian democrats anything over 50 
percent is a firstround victory

despite 10 years of peace israelis living 
in egypt still face resentment and are forced to keep a low profile 
for reasons of politics and security 
foreign minister moshe arens on a rare trip to egypt by a senior 
israeli official tried to raise israeli visibility recently by 
visiting this stateowned farm where israeli experts are involved in 
an irrigation project 
this project is a big success arens said and being a big 
success it will become well known 
the project was started in 1986 but was kept quiet until the 
foreign minister came with a busload of journalists 
egypts agriculture minister yussef wali noted that while the 
project had not been publicized in egyptian media it is highly 
visible to egyptians because it is about 60 miles north of cairo on 
a main highway to alexandria on the mediterranean 
it is seen by thousands of people and this is real publicity 
for the project wali said 
the farm however has no sign to show that israeli experts are 
there watching over such crops as chilis sweet peppers tomatoes 
and cucumbers 
a large greenandwhite billboard however announces saudi 
arabian cooperation in other aspects of the farm 
mark zuk 38 one of a halfdozen israeli agriculture advisers 
here said he had no specific instructions to hide his presence but 
he added that political events sometimes made the atmosphere tense 
and he avoids sensitive topics one such topic is the 15month 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip where israeli soldiers have killed more than 390 arabs 
we never talk about political subjects zuk said they 
dont bring it up and neither do i i feel comfortable with the 
people i am working with and dont feel any rejection 
thousands of israeli tourists have visited egypt since israel 
signed the peace treaty march 26 1979 that ended three decades of 
war about 100 israeli embassy staff members and their families now 
live in cairo but only about a dozen nonofficial israelis work in 
egypt on a fulltime basis 
ovadia keidar 48 an israeli agronomist who lives in cairo with 
his wife and three of his five children said the relationship 
between israelis and egyptians remains tentative complex and often 
emotional 
the peace agreement is not something that you can switch on and 
off you make the peace gradually breaking through one barrier and 
then another i believe that peace will survive the occasional ups 
and down what we have to do is understand each other 
keidar was born in egypt speaks arabic fluently and has a good 
knowledge of the country his family was forced out of egypt after 
the 1956 suez war and keidar became a settler in the sinai desert 
after it was captured by israel in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
he then fought as an israeli soldier on the egyptian front in the 
war of 1973 was uprooted from his sinai settlement by the 1979 
peace agreement and returned to work in cairo five years ago 
in the beginning he said he was afraid for his safety but 
eventually decided to stay 
if i couldnt start here who could he said 
keidar said his battle for acceptance has produced mixed results 
he recalled that when his daughter was 5 years old she was excluded 
from the birthday party of her best friend because her friends 
parents didnt want an israeli in their home 
she was very hurt and sad he said 
when his daughter turned 6 keidar had a birthday party in a 
restaurant and his daughters friend attended 
we met the parents there and became friendly he said one 
of the parents studied with my cousin 
the keidars now visit the egyptian family in their home but the 
egyptian family who are related by marriage to palestinians have 
yet to visit the keidar home 
there are still some barriers because of the palestinian 
problem but i can understand them said keidar adding he 
believed relations would remain uneasy with egypt until there was a 
negotiated settlement of the future of the west bank and gaza strip 
the low point in egyptianisraeli relations came oct 5 1985 
when seven israeli tourists were killed when an egyptian policeman 
opened fire on a beach party at ras bourka in the sinai the 
policeman suleiman khatir was sentenced to life in prison he died 
in jail as a result of what authorities said was a suicide 
earlier the same year an israeli embassy employee albert 
atrakchi 30 was assassinated by a gunman in cairo 
the only resident israeli correspondent in egypt yoram mizrachi 
of the liberal newspaper haaretz moves frequently to avoid being 
targeted after the egyptian weekly al ahali described him as a 
dangerous man and published his address 
other israelis he said use bodyguards because of resentment 
among egyptians 
mizrachi who has been in egypt about six months recalled that 
egyptian journalists once demanded he leave a news conference 
one of them called out that there was an israeli present and 
they would not participate if i did so i left 
mizrachi said however he was able to move freely to cover the 
news visiting neighborhoods throughout cairo and even the 
palestinian liberation organization 
a former commander of israeli troops in south lebanon mizrachi 
recently interviewed plo chairman yasser arafat risking censure and 
possible prosecution at home for dealing with the outlawed group

the younger son of martin luther king jr became 
heir apparent of a movement when he stood in the pulpit of his 
fathers church on what would have been the civil rights pioneers 
60th birthday 
dexter scott king declared that he the son of a son of a 
movement was ready to take a leadership role out rolled the 
resonant vibrant baritone that 25 years earlier prodded blacks to 
demand their share of the american dream 
for many it was as if mlk himself had come home 
but dexter king is a quiet man with a small circle of friends 
lifts weights at home and prefers tennis and books on nutrition to 
politics he was planted squarely in his fathers shoes with a 
degree of reluctance 
i was tapped it was simply an issue of something that was 
inevitable he said it surprised a lot of people including 
myself because its not the kind of thing that you can readily 
prepare for 
i had to come to grips with the fact that this life does not 
belong to me and although all of us like to think that we have a 
choice in what our roles will be i have to think of my fathers 
role 
dexter kings jan 14 appointment as president of the king 
center aimed at keeping his fathers legacy alive was a relief to 
the civil rights community pressure within the movement for someone 
to take up the torch had been heavy 
when coretta scott king made the announcement she pointed out 
that dexter at 28 is about the same age his father was when he led 
bus boycotts in montgomery ala that sparked the civil rights 
movement 
being the son of the civil rights leader makes dexter uniquely 
qualified to assume the civil rights mantle she said 
atlanta mayor andrew young a member of the centers board of 
directors and a longtime contemporary of martin luther king jr 
said dexters selection showed we are moving forward carrying on 
with another generation 
king says he doesnt want to have to fight with his fathers 
image 
i have never felt like i or anyone else can walk in his shoes 
i can only follow and complement what hes already done ive never 
seen myself as one who just inherited leadership there are certain 
things you just cant inherit 
yet there are things he did inherit among them the calm pensive 
demeanor that was his fathers trademark not the speaking style 
that went to younger sister bernice but dexter king does sound and 
look like his dad 
what he did was exclusive to him i can only be my best self 
and if being my best self means that i achieve great things and 
become a great leader then i will be commended on that basis 
but not because people say youre going to follow in your fathers 
footsteps 
larry carter dean of the martin luther king jr international 
chapel at morehouse college sees dexter king as a peaceful man who 
will function well as president of the center he seems natural 
for that based on my assessment of his temperament hes very 
polite hes very considerate 
hes not a riproaring orator like his sister bernice but hes 
capable of passion and has believability 
carter who has known king for about four years said he never 
knew whether the mlk image was a problem for dexter king he never 
let it show 
king who attended morehouse his fathers alma mater but has 
not graduated is founder and president of visionary development 
corp a business and development consulting firm he also directs 
the centers office of special events and entertainment and produced 
a record marking the first federal king holiday in 1986 
king said he was first considered for president of the king 
center two years ago when there was some talk amongst the board 
members and my mother about moving one of the four king children 
into a leadership role 
but yolanda 33 serves as the centers producing director of 
cultural affairs and runs a theater group with attallah shabazz 
daughter of the late malcolm x martin luther king iii a retiring 
softspoken 31yearold is a fulton county commissioner and 
bernice 25 is working toward a graduate degree in law and theology 
at emory university in atlanta 
at that time i was not specifically targeted king said 
recently our immediate family more or less talked about the 
fact that my mother is not getting any younger 
he explained that the changes effective april 4 the 21st 
anniversary of his fathers assassination would free my mother 
up and allow us to work as a team king will manage the centers 
administrative operations while his mother serves as spokeswoman and 
chief executive officer 
some of the goals he has set for the king center include getting 
young people excited about a movement they are too young to 
remember he also wants to disseminate the centers message and 
nonviolent teachings 
another primary goal is to get the center on a steady financial 
base he said with an endowment that allows us to 
institutionalize our work so that were not just trying to hang on 
day by day or donation by donation 
he hopes it wont be too lonely at the top 
i dont know a lot of young national and international leaders 
but i will be thrust into that role it is lonely and it is 
frustrating because you really want to have people around you who 
can really understand where youre coming from

cape town south africas oldest 
city wants to be the countrys first completely desegregated 
municipality 
we are striving toward prize no 1 that the whole city is a 
free settlement area but the government is hardly likely to do 
that said mayor peter muller he meant the national government 
national apartheid laws allow municipalities to decide whether to 
open public amenities such as parks beaches and buses cape town is 
the only major city with no segregated public facilities 
but the national government holds the power to segregate 
residential areas schools and hospitals 
the cape town city council has petitioned repeatedly for the 
right to declare its whole area or sections of it open to free 
settlement the law prohibited multiracial neighborhoods although 
parts of cape town and other cities are mixed with nonwhites 
living illegally in designated white areas 
on march 2 a new law took effect that will allow multiracial 
neighborhoods on a limited basis muller believes that a section of 
cape town will be the first area where all races can live together 
legally since the governing national party legislated residential 
segregation in 1950 
its common cause that district six will be the first free 
settlement area said muller he referred to a hillside near the 
center of town where a squalid but lively multiracial neighborhood 
was bulldozed in the 1960s and declared whites only 
district six is now bordered by allwhite apartment blocks and a 
white technical school but grasscovered lots intersected by empty 
streets and dotted with mosques and churches lie vacant because 
most capetonians felt the demolition had stigmatized the area 
nobody with any kind of sensitivity would have taken it upon 
themselves to in any way develop district six said muller 
before cities were granted the right to open public amenities to 
all races the cape town city council refused to enforce the 
separate amenities act instead of signs demarcating swimming pools 
and toilets for whites or nonwhites muller said the 
council put up notices warning disallowed people that they could 
be prosecuted if they broke the law 
but we didnt prosecute he said 
right through the 1960s we fought the removal of the colored 
mixedrace people from the voters roll and as representatives on 
the council recalled the city councils executive committee 
chairman dick friedlander he was mayor in 1972 when national law 
forced the city council to become allwhite 
we held protest meetings we passed resolutions we did all we 
could friedlander said six of the 34 councilors were 
legislated out of office 
some of the colored councilors were elected from predominantly 
white areas and viceversa muller said we had gotten away 
from racial stigma 
the people of mixedrace indonesian malaysian or indian 
ancestry whose religions customs language and architecture 
contributed to cape towns historic and cultural attraction now have 
no direct voice in how the city is run they can elect neighborhood 
management committees which appoint delegates to a regional council 
south africas parliament sits in cape town the legislative 
capital the first whites to settle in south africa were merchants 
from the dutch east india company who established a trading post in 
cape town in 1652 
the 1985 census put the population of greater cape town 
including suburbs at 154 million 433000 whites 839000 
coloreds 18000 asiatics and 254000 blacks city spokesman ted 
doman said the blacks are grossly undercounted 
officially no blacks live in cape town the adjacent townships 
of langa nyanga and crossroads were taken from the city councils 
control although the city provides most of the water sewerage and 
fire protection services that exist in those areas 
we feel a moral if not a strategic obligation to make sure 
those places have the highest quality of life they can expect 
bearing in mind the shanty type of existence there said muller

lawmakers rejected reinstating the death 
penalty after 137 years even for drug dealers convicted of murder 
we have a history of five generations without the death 
penalty and i do not believe the people of rhode island are ready 
for that rep mabel anderson said tuesday as the house judiciary 
committee defeated two capital punishment bills 
the committee by a 151 vote turned down a broad deathpenalty 
bill and handed a 133 defeat to gov edward d diprete who had 
proposed legislation targeting drug kingpins who kill 
similar bills are pending in the state senate but committe 
chairman jeffrey j teitz promised to block them if they reach the 
house 
all the evidence we have before us clearly demonstrates that 
the death penalty does not serve as a deterrent to crime said 
teitz 
rhode island abolished capital punishment in 1852 because of 
fears a man may have been wrongly hanged eight years earlier an 
attempt to restore capital punishment for prison killings in the 
mid1970s was found unconstitutional

greenpeace protesters today dumped 
outside the us embassy seven barrels of chemical waste they 
claimed was collected from outfall pipes at an american base in 
antarctica 
peter wilkinson a spokesman for the environmental group said 
the waste showed high levels of heavy metals such as cadmium and 
that the protest was part of a stepped up campaign for a cleanup of 
the mcmurdo base 
embassy spokesman mike gould dismissed claims that the contents 
were toxic saying the liquid was nothing more than normal organic 
sewage 
he said the delivery of the drums was nothing but public 
posturing 
the americans are causing a lot of environmental problems in 
antarctica wilkinson said they have one of the worst records 
they must have a sense of responsibility and we are going to make an 
example out of them 
lined up in front of the embassy gate the barrels read danger 
cadmium 
wilkinson said the waste was collected during the groups recent 
expedition to antarctica he accused the united states of gross 
neglect of the fragile environment there saying greenpeace had 
detected chromium lead and copper in wastes dumped into the ocean 
from mcmurdo 
he said the level of cadmium was far in excess of that permitted 
in europe or the united states 
the embassy called in local authorities to remove the barrels 
after greenpeace refused to take them away 
gould said greenpeace had failed to acknowledge that the 
washingtonbased national science foundation which oversees us 
activities in antarctica was committed to cleaning up mcmurdo 
mcmurdo the largest station in antarctica was set up in 1957 
several hundred people work there during the southern hemisphere

the tarttongued immigration chief 
suggested a congressman stick his finger in an electrical socket 
after he alleged her department was riddled with corruption 
you as a person you do not deserve to be called by a name 
other than fumble face shrieked immigration commissioner miriam 
defensor santiago in a statement to a manila television station on 
tuesday 
and you can go stick your finger in the wall socket 
mrs santiago a former judge made the remark in response to 
rep mario joaquins claim in the house of reprsentatives on monday 
that the commission on immigration and deportation was fraught with 
corruption 
mrs santiago said she wanted to challenge joaquin to a fist 
fight to defend her reputation there was no immediate response 
from the congressman 
since her appointment last year mrs santiago has cultivated a 
reputation for honesty and efficiency in a bureaucracy riddled with 
graft corruption and inefficiency 
she once warned immigration officers at manila airport that she 
was aware of their corrupt practices and would cut them into small 
pieces and feed you to the sharks in manila bay 
she then added that the sharks would probably not devour the 
officials out of professional courtesy 
critics however claim the commission is still corrupt and that 
mrs santiago has run roughshod over employees to enhance her 
reputation and launch a political career

a federal jury found two transit authority police 
officers guilty tuesday of falsely arresting eight subway riders on 
trumpedup charges 
officers alphonse iannacone 42 an 18year veteran of the 
transit department and mary mcdermott 32 a transit police officer 
since 1980 were each charged with seven counts of conspiring to 
violate civil rights and one count of deprivation of civil rights 
the jury convicted them on all counts after deliberating for 
three days 
the officers face up to 71 years in prison each and stiff fines 
when they are sentenced may 10 by us district judge shirley wohl 
kram 
prosecutors called more than 20 witnesses including the eight 
men arrested by iannacone and mcdermott in 1983 and 1984 and the 
eight victims of those men 
the men all of whom were black hispanic or asian testified 
they were taken off subway trains handcuffed and detained on 
charges of either sexual abuse or attempted grand larceny 
the alleged victims seven women and one man described their 
shock at learning they were listed as the complainants in the cases 
none had sought police assistance the man said he was not a 
pickpocket victim and the women said nothing was missing from the 
purses and they had not felt anyone touching them in a lewd way 
relatives of the two officers shouted oh no and how could 
they do this as the verdict was announced ms mcdermott appeared 
to have tears in her eyes and iannacone appeared shaken 
its really hard for a police officer to get a fair trial 
said defense attorney barry agulnick he and the other defense 
lawyer kenneth kaplan said they would appeal 
transit police chief vincent del castillo issued a statement 
saying while we can never be pleased by the conviction of any 
police officers we are pleased that this old and lingering issue 
has finally been resolved 
the defense had two witnesses a lieutenant who once taught at 
the transit academy explained that discrepancies between arresting 
officers notes and those of the prosecutor are not unusual and a 
psychologist testified that victims of sex abuse often deny it 
occurred

opposition legislators forced parliament 
to adjourn tuesday after a newspaper gave its account of a secret 
inquiry into the 1984 assassination of prime minister indira gandhi 
the report in the indian express newspaper said the investigation 
cast suspicion on rajendra kumar dhawan mrs gandhis personal 
secretary when she was shot oct 31 1984 in the garden of her new 
delhi residence by two of her sikh bodyguards 
dhawan 52 did not continue in that job after mrs gandhis son 
rajiv gandhi took over as prime minister but he was appointed last 
month as an officer on special duty in the powerful cabinet 
secretariat 
speaker balram jakhar adjourned the session of the peoples house 
lower house of parliament when opposition members demanded the 
secret report be made public 
jakhar called their actions shameful and adjourned the 
sessions after about two hours of heated argments between the 
opposition and deputies of the governing congress party 
the government said the report was kept secret in the interest of 
national security 
the indian express headquartered in bombay is the countrys 
largest englishlanguage newspaper with a circulation of 11 million 
and frequently criticizes rajiv gandhi and his administration 
it gave this account of the secret report under a frontpage 
headline what has been withheld from all 
the inquiry by supreme court justice mp thakkar showed that 
consciously or unconsciously dhawan may have facilitated the 
commission of the crime 
thakkar claimed dhawan lied during questioning and gave 
unconvincing explanations about suspicious entries in his diary 
which included the name of one of the assassins 
dhawan altered the time of mrs gandhis appointment with a 
television crew on the morning of the assassination the prime 
minister was killed when walking from her residence to her office 
next door for the television interview 
dhawan who was walking with mrs gandhi fell back in the 
nick of time as they were approaching the scene of the 
assassination 
dhawan knew beant singh one of the killers who was slain by 
other bodyguards minutes after the assassination but he denied that 
during questioning 
a second guard convicted of the assassination and a third sikh 
found guilty of conspiracy were executed 
the government reported mrs gandhi was killed in revenge for an 
army raid she ordered in june 1984 on the golden temple the sikhs 
holiest shrine 
at least 1200 people most of them sikhs were killed in the 
raid on the temple in amritsar the government said sikh militants 
had turned the temple complex into a hideout for terrorists 
sikh activists have been fighting since 1982 for an independent 
homeland in the northern state of punjab they accuse hindus of 
discrimination 
sikhs form only 2 percent of indias population of 880 million 
but they are in a majority in punjab hindus comprise 80 percent of 
the nations population

hilda barahona steps across a 
mountain of garbage and contends with vultures dogs and pigs for 
edible or saleable refuse from homes better than her own 
she wont bother to vote on sunday when this small central 
american nation wracked by civil war chooses a new president 
one wants to believe that changing the government could improve 
things but one sees that they stay the same the poor remain poor 
and disdained she says 
more than 200 men women and children toddlers to the aged and 
infirm scavenge through the soyapango dump five miles east of san 
salvador every day beneath a searing tropical sun and despite an 
intense stench 
dump trucks and bulldozers their drivers faces covered against 
the smell with kerchiefs or surgical masks traverse the twoacre 
pile 
of 15 votingage people interviewed five said they planned to 
cast a ballot sunday most because it was a duty of 
citizenship voting is legally required here although there is no 
real sanction for not voting 
seven parties are contesting the election the second 
presidential vote since 1982 when the country began a rough journey 
toward representative constitutional rule 
before that this nation of 55 million had been governed 
throughout its modern history by an alliance of landed oligarchs and 
the armed forces 
this year for the first time salvadoran voters have a chance to 
replace the party in power with a party that has a completely 
different outlook 
the incumbent christian democrats are trailing the opposition 
rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena with the leftist 
democratic convergence running third 
arenas economic philosphy revolves around the marketplace and 
private enterprise the party says it will institute capitalism 
for the masses although it is hard to see how denizens of the 
dump would accumulate capital the only one who would express a 
preference said he was voting for arena 
were not here because we like this work said rene antonio 
vasquez who will not vote were here out of necessity its the 
only option we have we have to feed our kids 
the 19yearold father of two has worked as a construction 
laborer but such employment is sporadic he has spent most of the 
past 12 years scrounging through the soyapango dump for nine of 
those years the nation has been in a civil war between 
ussupported government forces and the leftist farabundo marti 
national liberation front 
unemployment nationwide is estimated at near 40 percent over 
half the population is illiterate fewer than a quarter of rural 
salvadorans have access to safe drinking water el salvador has the 
highest rate of infant mortality in central america the main cause 
is diarrhea 
the country has been the western hemispheres biggest recipient 
of us aid this decade despite the donation of more than 3 bilion 
in us economic and military assistance since 1980 several major 
indices including availability of potable water have worsened 
rather than improved 
gilberto rivera 23 supports his mother sister and niece with 
the 4 he earns scavenging on an average day plastic fetches three 
cents a pound scrap metal one cent paper three cents and iron two 
cents 
one government is just like another he said of the election 
theyre of no matter to us 
he said scavenging has its hazards principally exposure to 
disease the septic environment is particularly harmful to the 
children 
francisca aguilar 37 her hands caked with black grime talked 
as she stooped and ripped open a plastic bag she picked through the 
contents melon rinds eggshells chicken bones and empty 
containers separating plastic and glass while tossing organic 
morsels aside to be snatched up by grayheaded vultures hopping 
through the trash 
her 14yearold daughter lidia worked beside her lidia attended 
school through second grade but had to leave because the 3 her 
mother makes each day from the dump isnt enough for notebooks and 
shoes and clothes to keep her five children in school 
ive only got the boy her one son studying mrs aguilar 
said 
lidia withdrew a pair of eyeglasss with a missing lens from the 
rubbish she put them on and continued sifting

ahem no coughing please 
heeding a plea in the concert program hundreds of winter cold 
and flu sufferers at the university of iowas hancher auditorium 
made a collective effort not to cough during violinist isaac sterns 
concert last week 
the coughing has been so bad this winter that the audience has 
been dubbed the hancher hackers 
a review of a january concert devoted as much space to the 
coughing as to the performance by japanese pianist mitsuko uchida 
said judith hurtig hanchers marketing director 
so she said she and hancher director wallace chappell devised a 
letter to insert in the program asking concertgoers to suppress 
their coughs 
we all know that an iowa winter brings flu and colds the 
letter said but we would like to ask our audience to be 
considerate of others 
there is little the hancher staff can do to control the 
coughers we must rely on the politeness of our audience and ask 
that they be considerate coughs can be muffled the ushers have 
cough drops which are freely given to those who request them 
as a last resort the letter said audience members could leave 
the concert hall and hear the rest of the performance in soundproof 
observation booths 
it was astonishing the effect it had stunning ms hurtig 
said

getting into the easter spirit the 
village board has lifted a ban against bunnies 
since the 1960s an ordinance had prohibited everyone except 
slaughterhouses and meat packing plants from keeping rabbits and 
some other kinds of animals 
but after the ordinance was criticized by residents who had been 
secretly raising rabbits the board voted 42 monday night to take 
rabbits off the list of undesirable animals 
like dogs and cats rabbits will have to be licensed and will be 
limited to two per household 
village president daniel gorski who said he is not an animal 
hater voted against the proposal saying we had people with 
rabbits behind my house and they had unsightly hutches 
but trustee jack olson who voted for the measure joked we 
have to allow rabbits because easter is coming 
some residents had been raising rabbits secretly for years and 
last fall a new road was paved to make way for a subdivision during 
construction a section of trees had to be removed exposing once 
hidden hutches 
a police officer noticed the hutches and notified the village 
board 
the families raising the rabbits were told to remove the animals 
by jan 1 rather than give their rabbits away they fought the 
ordinance 
why would they village board make us get rid of them 
resident carol werner asked do they bark at night and keep the 
neighbors awake all night

negotiators reached a lastminute settlement 
tuesday night averting a strike that would have paralyzed city 
buses trolleys and subways that carry 400000 commuters to work 
daily 
the threeyear contract agreement was announced shortly before 
the midnight strike deadline by louis j gambaccini general manager 
of the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority and roger 
tauss president of transport workers union local 234 
we think we have what is in our opinion a fair agreement all 
around gambaccini said it was a tough tough negotiation 
i would like to say that the union has been admirable in its 
seriousness in its approach and we tried to respect that i could 
not have asked for a better earnest effort he said 
tauss also said he was happy with the agreement 
gambaccini and tauss refused to reveal any terms of the agreement 
until a union membership meeting wednesday 
the sticking point in negotiations had been wages pensions and 
septas demand that the union absorb projected increases in 
healthcare costs by paying some of the premiums or approving a cut 
in benefits 
the authority has projected its health care costs would increase 
from a current 20 million to 30 million in the next three years 
the news left workers gathered at a north philadelphia depot 
relieved 
i feel good about the news because i know if they got us a 
contract they got us a hell of a good one and i know we dont have 
any blue crossblue shield to pay said jean alexander a union 
spokeswoman 
leaders of local 234 which represents about 5200 city bus 
trolley and subway operators had said the strike would begin at 
1201 am wednesday when the contract expired if there was no 
agreement 
contract negotiations had resumed with a state mediator ordering 
both sides to avoid public statements after transit workers hinted 
there was nothing on the table to head off the citys fourth transit 
strike in 12 years 
before the announcement police prepared to put extra officers on 
traffic control duty for the wednesday morning rush and the bicycle 
coaltion of delaware valley set up a phone line to offer information 
on bicycle routes 
the authority told commuters it would add trains to regional rail 
lines which would not be affected and make more stops through the 
city 
the transit workers last struck for four days in 1986 previous 
walkouts included a 44day strike in 1977 a 19day strike in 1981 
a 108day strike in 1983

law enforcement officials reacted with 
enthusiasm tuesday after the bush administration banned imports of 
semiautomatic assault weapons including the type used to kill five 
schoolchildren in stockton 
this is great news said state attorney general john van de 
kamp todays action is long overdue and i urge the administration 
to make it permanent 
i congratulate the president and the administration but my 
response from the heart is thank god for barbara bush said city 
police chief daryl f gates referring to the first ladys outspoken 
opposition to assault weapons 
the order suspends the importation of more than 110000 
assaulttype weapons for which import applications are pending said 
national drug control director william j bennett 
affected by the decision are imports of ak47s uzi carbines 
fnfal and fnfnctype weapons as well as steyr aug semiautomatic 
weapons 
on jan 17 a disturbed drifter patrick purdy used an ak47 to 
kill five children and wound 30 other people at grover cleveland 
elementary school in stockton 
using the weapon which allows the shooter to fire single shots 
as quickly as he can pull the trigger purdy was able to fire 106 
bullets in two minutes he then shot and killed himself with a 
handgun 
a rising death toll from the use of semiautomatic weapons in gang 
warfare had already prompted an outcry against the guns but the 
stockton tragedy crystallized opposition and led to a nationwide 
movement to ban assault weapons 
on monday the california assembly narrowly passed legislation 
that would virtually ban the sale of all semiautomatic assault 
weapons the weapons have already been banned by local ordinances in 
los angeles and cleveland 
van de kamp said he thought the stockton shootings and the move 
to restrict assault weapons in california have had a tremendous 
impact on the administrations thinking on this issue 
assemblyman michael roos of los angeles who wrote the assembly 
bill said he cant stop shaking from the excitement 
not in my wildest imagination would i have ever dreamed that 
within 24 hours of the assembly taking action that the united states 
government would effectively ban the importation of these 
weapons roos said 
the state senate passed a similar bill last week the differences 
between that bill and the houses must be resolved before the 
governor can sign legislation 
the bush administrations action tuesday also brought praise from 
roberg strang a spokesman for the drug enforcement administration 
in new york 
certainly anything thats done is helpful to us strang 
said in the last year agents across the country have been issued 
submachine guns because of the automatic weapons that were up 
against on a daily basis certainly anything we can do to 
lessen the firepower of the drug traffickers is going to be 
beneficial to us

chancellor helmut kohls party is 
loudly downplaying its recent string of election setbacks but 
quietly eyeing a possible change at the top 
kohls popularity among west germans has plunged in recent 
months and the partys fortunes appear to be following him the big 
test the national elections that choose a federal chancellor is in 
december 1990 
some key political figures already have begun distancing 
themselves from kohl whose image has been bruised by a chemical 
weapons scandal indecisiveness over nato strategy and numerous 
domestic troubles 
not the least of his problems is a series of poor showings by his 
christian democrats in regional elections which some party regulars 
worry may be a harbinger of the national race 
the party lost its legislative majority in west berlin on jan 
29 and public opinion polls conducted since indicate kohls 
conservative party would lose to the leftleaning social democrats 
if national elections were held today 
on sunday the christian democrats lost control of the frankfurt 
city council and other important local legislatures in balloting 
throughout hesse state 
the conservative bonn daily die welt suggested tuesday that the 
party could use a fresh start with badenwuerttemberg state 
governor lothar spaeth replacing kohl 
lothar spaeth is certainly very suitable as chancellor 
stuttgart mayor manfred rommel a prominent christian democrat said 
in an interview for todays edition of the bild newspaper 
such speculation is bad news for the christian democrats who 
lack a clear majority in the federal parliament controlling the 
government through a delicate alliance with the liberal free 
democratic party 
the free democrats also suffered in the hesse elections and 
party leader otto lambsdorff hinted that the relationship with 
kohls party was being reevaluated 
we have no cause to stick our head between our knees 
lambsdorff said monday we have considerable doubts about the way 
the campaign in frankfurt was conducted in the final days and weeks 
with regard to policies on foreigners asylumseekers and 
immigrants 
rightwing extremists of the national democratic party won 66 
percent of the vote in elections to the frankfurt city council 
focusing on what the federal government should do to slow the influx 
of foreigners 
likewise the christian democrats showing in the world arena has 
not generated many popularity points 
the leadership has taken a beating over its handling of us 
charges that west german companies helped build a suspected chemical 
weapons plant for libya and over its refusal to be pinned down on 
whether it will support nato plans to modernize shortrange nuclear 
missiles on west german soil 
the head of the christian democrats bavarian sister party the 
christian social union described the outcome of sundays elections 
as catastrophic but resisted suggestions that a new candidate 
for chancellor is needed 
the chancellor is elected he is the partys national leader 
and i dont know anyone who wants to relieve him christian social 
union leader theodor waigel told the ard television network 
meeting reporters monday kohl alternately exuded confidence and 
defensiveness as he downplayed the hesse elections and his tumble in 
the polls 
we have every chance to win the federal elections kohl said 
he blamed the christian democrats poor showing in hesse on 
unpopular but necessary social security and tax reforms 
kohl conceded that the party finds itself in a very serious 
situation and must consider major policy revisions during a 
conference planned in midapril 
but the chancellor bristled at questions about whether he would 
bow out of the competition for the partys nomination for 
chancellor claiming he had survived political setbacks before 
and faced the next campaign with great composure 
kohl noted that the fringe parties the ultrarightist national 
democratic party and the farleft greens party not the rival 
social democrats were the biggest beneficiaries of the christian 
democrats losses 
however the social democrats in west berlin have entered into an 
alliance with the farleft alternative list group to gain control of 
the citystates government in the wake of the christian democrat 
losses 
some political observers say such an alliance could happen 
nationally creating a liberal block strong enough to oust the 
christian democrats

moslem anger over the satanic verses a novel 
they say insults their faith has renewed debate over britains 
ancient rarely used blasphemy law 
the law which has been cited in court just twice in the past 67 
years applies only to the christian state church of england 
its failure to embrace other religions was among the reasons the 
law commission an independent panel of academics and jurists 
called in 1985 for its abolition 
but others including moslems are fighting to extend the law to 
other religions to reflect britains multiethnic society 
moslems say it would give them legal ground for opposing salman 
rushdie the author of the satanic verses without resorting to 
the violence urged by iranian leaders who have called for his death 
eight moslem lawyers failed monday to persuade a london 
magistrate to summon rushdie to court on charges of blasphemous and 
seditious libel but they vowed to press their cause 
what we are asking is that the law should be changed so that it 
gives equal status to all citizens said liaqat hussain 
secretarygeneral of the bradfordbased council for mosques 
moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes islam by 
associating the prophet mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting 
that the koran islams holy book was mohammeds invention not 
allahs work 
rushdie born to a moslem family in india is a british citizen 
he has been in hiding in england since feb 14 when iranian leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered moslems to kill him 
the british government has refused to review the blasphemy law 
there is no general consensus for reform says the home office 
john vincent a bristol university history professor wrote in 
the times of london that the governments position looks narrowly 
ethnocentric 
cases of blasphemy and its written form blasphemous libel date 
to the time when church and state were indivisible and an attack on 
christianity was regarded as subversion but church power waned and 
the law came under secular court jurisdiction in 1676 
as part of the system of common rather than statute law offenses 
are decided by legal precedent and punishments are set by the 
courts judges have wide discretion since there is no definition 
for blasphemy 
blasphemy is generally considered as the use of scurrilous 
abusive vilifying ludicrous or offensive words about god or 
christ the christian religion the bible or the formularies of 
the church of england as by law established material must be 
deemed strongly offensive to break the law 
other european nations also have such laws especially the 
strongly roman catholic ones including ireland italy spain and 
portugal says nicholas walter an expert on blasphemy but they 
are not often used he says 
hollands law bans blasphemy that is deliberately intended to 
offend religious feelings but the justice ministry has decided 
rushdies book did not break it 
in france which has no blasphemy law activists have tried to 
ban material on grounds of defamation 
in the first british prosecution for blasphemy since 1922 
antipornography activist mary whitehouse sued gay news magazine in 
1977 for publishing an explicit poem about a roman soldiers 
homosexual fantasies over christs crucified body the magazine and 
editor denis lemon were fined 2500 and lemon drew a ninemonth 
suspended sentence he lost an appeal 
in september state attorneys rejected mrs whitehouses demand 
to prosecute the makers of the film the last temptation of 
christ for showing christ dreaming of having sex with a prostitute 
in its 32 decision in favor of abolishing the law the law 
commission held that it was wrong to single out one religion for 
protection when members of society have a multiplicity of faiths 
or none at all 
the commission noted that most of the public comment it received 
during its fouryear inquiry from 2000 individuals or groups and 
11000 petition signatories supported retaining the law in some 
form but it said none of the proposed substitutes would work 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual head of the 
church of england approves of extending the law to all religions 
an option jewish and moslem groups support 
opponents say such a change would have to give protection for any 
organization calling itself a religion including cults and would 
infringe upon freedom of speech 
supporters of an extended law see no threat to free speech 
vincent argues that it is not denials or criticism of religion that 
are blasphemous but truly offensive sometimes inflammatory 
language

trucks and jeeps stand idle for lack of 
fuel specially trained bolivian police complain of too little food 
it hasnt been a good week at this key base of operations for the 
national war on drug trafficking 
indeed us and bolivian officials say that despite improved 
cooperation between their countries the battle is being lost 
because troops dont get enough logistic and economic support 
our biggest problem is the lack of resources said travis 
kuykendall the us drug enforcement administrations attache in 
bolivia 
if congress does not send checks to back us they should send 
us home he said in an interview 
us aid for drug interdiction in bolivia was cut from 15 
million in 1988 to 10 million 
we are doing everything we can to fight the cocaine trade but 
we are fighting a losing war if consumer nations do not increase 
their support information minister herman antelo told the 
associated press 
an elite ustrained antidrug police squad of 200 men known as 
the leopards and about 30 us drug enforcement and border patrol 
agents are based in chimore a tropical town in the heart of the 
chapare its a region east of cochabamba city known for its 
cultivation of coca the plant whose dried leaves are the source of 
cocaine 
from chimore the men stage raids on cocaine paste processing 
pits that lie hidden under the jungle canopy 
during a weekend visit however police said they halted 
operations because they did not have fuel for the vehicles or enough 
food for the bolivian forces 
the united states has donated eight rebuilt huey helicopters to 
cover an area the size of texas five were operational during the 
weekend but were being deployed in another region of the country 
the beni plains 
so coca leaf buying and selling was brisk along the main chapare 
highway 
on better weeks bolivian police helped by the american agents 
raid hundreds of crude cocaine processing pits 
but the increased police presence has led many processors to set 
up camp outside range of the bases ground vehicles and even 
choppers according to drug enforcement agents who asked not to be 
identified 
gov bob martinez of flordia visited the chapare region tuesday 
under tight security because of reports an assassination squad of 
colombian drug dealers was in the area 
we had some information that was not confirmed that there was a 
colombian hit team in the area said us drug enforcement agent 
gene castillo he accompanied martinez who arrived in bolivia 
monday and us ambassador robert gelbard on their tour of the 
district a dozen dea agents and bolivian police provided security 
for the group 
martinez commenting on the importance of the coca plant to the 
area farmers said we cant win the war here we are going to 
have to win it in the us 
authorities of both countries say cooperation has increased and 
they are confiscating more chemicals used to process cocaine 
according to the state department last year they seized 5549 
gallons of ether 11158 gallons of sulfuric acid 927 tons of lime 
10304 gallons of acetone and 15 million gallons of gasoline and 
diesel fuel 
our main purpose in the chapare is to stop the ability to get 
precursor chemicals in and cocaine paste out kuykendall said 
then they cant sell paste and farmers will not have a market for 
their leaves 
raids on pits where the leaf is mashed and mixed with chemicals 
are on the rise last year 3542 pits were raided compared with 
1112 in 1987 according to the state department also last year 
authorities raided 24 laboratories where the paste is converted into 
hydrochloric cocaine the refined powder sniffed by drug users in 
1987 just eight were raided the records show 
but in almost all cases the processors manage to flee before 
the raids and the number of pits raided is believed to represent 
only a small portion of bolivias cocaine industry whose annual 
profits are estimated at 300 million little if any real decline in 
trafficking has been noted 
according to us officials neither bolivia nor the us 
government has a single plane capable of intercepting drug flights 
out of the country large areas bordering argentina peru and brazil 
have no police presence and drugs also move freely on the rivers 
the united states bought eight powerful motorboats and a crew 
last week confiscated 950 pounds of cocaine paste on one river but 
they had to stop because they too ran out of fuel

president bush publicly endorsed a shift in 
us policy toward third world debt backing a proposal by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady for partial forgiveness of outstanding bank 
loans to developing nations 
bushs approval of the plan announced tuesday night after a 
meeting of the national security council ended a period of white 
house caution toward the debtreduction scheme outlined by brady 
last friday 
the plan calls for commercial banks to forgive some of the 410 
billion in debt run up by developing nations mostly in latin 
america 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater had said bush did 
not want to react to the new proposal which supplants a fouryear 
old us policy of opposition toward debt forgiveness too hastily 
however he said after reviewing the proposal with the security 
council the president fully supports the concepts and processes 
for debt reduction and economic growth outlined by secretary brady 
fitzwater said the new policy also is supported by secretary of 
state james a baker iii as well as the federal reserve system 
which reportedly had expressed some reservations to it 
the new policy modifies a plan outlined in 1985 by thentreasury 
secretary baker calling for banks to issue new loans to developing 
nations that instituted economic reforms without forgiving any of 
the outstanding debt 
however the baker plan resulted in little in the way of new 
bank loans to heavily indebted third world nations 
the new policy reflects a bush administration decision to view 
debtreduction as a national security issue as well as an economic 
one particularly in the aftermath of riots in venezuela aggravated 
by austerity programs forced by that nations debt burden 
bradys plan calls for banks to forgive part of the outstanding 
debt by using money from the world bank and the international 
monetary fund as collateral 
the plan also envisions banks swapping some of the debt for bonds 
of lower face value 
brady unveiled the proposal last week in a speech to a conference 
sponsored by the bretton woods committee a group devoted to 
international economic issues 
the plan was widely applauded by the international banking 
community and by leaders in both debtor and creditor nations 
however the reluctance of the white house to back the plan 
publicly when it was announced led to speculation of divisions 
within the government over details 
the security council decided that this was the best way to 
proceed fitzwater said after what he said was a difficult 
discussion at which a variety of viewpoints were expressed

the nuclear regulatory commission has put 
national security at risk by allowing newly hired personnel to start 
work without security clearances and by failing to reinvestigate 
many veteran workers a government auditing agency said today 
the general accounting office said it found that since 1983 about 
10 percent of nrc employees who began working before their security 
investigations were completed later left the agency because the 
checks disclosed drugrelated or other personal problems that made 
them unacceptable security risks it said nearly all workers are 
granted this security waiver 
the report was the subject of a public hearing today before a 
house government operations subcommittee which requested the gao 
investigation in 1987 
at nrc headquarters in rockville md spokesman robert newlin 
said we are planning improvements in our programs that are 
responsive to the gao recommendations he said details of these 
changes would be revealed to the house panel 
the gao report criticized the nrc for failing to reinvestigate 
nearly half of the approximately 10600 people who hold security 
clearances only those holding the most sensitive jobs are subjected 
to reinvestigation but the gao said results of those probes 
indicate a need to extend the practice to all workers 
reinvestigations revealed cleared persons with histories of 
child molestation drug abuse and criminal activities the report 
said 
periodic reinvestigations can highlight these problems and 
provide nrc information needed to determine whether an employee 
could be a possible candidate for activities such as espionage 
that would endanger national security 
the gao said it reviewed a sample of nrcs personnel security 
files for clearances since 1983 and found several cases that 
underscored the need for stronger security rules 
it cited an example of an nrc branch chief who was granted the 
highest level of security clearance in 1979 and then suspended in 
1983 after the employee was indicted on 52 counts of interstate 
transportation in aid of racketeering the worker was found 
innocent but the nrc later fired him after learning that the worker 
had a business interest in an outcall massage and escort service 
the nrc said it does not reinvestigate workers with lowerlevel 
clearances because of the added cost and because those employees 
have only limited access to classified information 
the report was critical of the nrcs practice of allowing new 
hires to start before completion of background investigations by the 
office of personnel management or the fbi it said the security 
clearance process takes so long that the requirement is waived for 
about 99 percent of new employees including those with access to 
nuclear weapons design data and other highly sensitive information 
waivers have become the rule rather than the exception the 
report said 
the gao investigators said a review of nrc files since 1983 
showed that in about 10 percent of cases in which security clearance 
requirements were waived the employees later were forced out 
the report cited as an example a reactor operator examiner who 
worked for more than a year without a security clearance before the 
background check revealed that the employee had received treatment 
for drug and alcohol abuse had physically abused his wife and 
children and had not filed a federal income tax return for 13 years 
the gao also criticized the nrc for failing to set rules on 
security clearances for people who require unescorted access to 
nuclear power plants it said this was particularly important in 
light of increasing threats of sabotage and arson directed at 
nuclear plants the nrc said in a report last summer that excluding 
bomb threats the number of such reported security threats had grown 
from 84 in 1986 to 205 the following year

us officials say the conviction of lebanese 
hijacker fawaz younis affirms the longarm tactics they used to 
lure him aboard a yacht in the mediterranean sea with promises of 
sex and drugs 
the blackhaired bearded younis held in isolation since his 
arrest in september 1987 was convicted tuesday in us district 
court of leading five heavily armed men aboard royal jordanian 
airlines flight 402 in beirut lebanon on june 11 1985 
the hijackers members of lebanons amal militia a shiite moslem 
group held the 70 passengers and crew hostage for 30 hours to 
publicize their demands for aid in their battle against palestinian 
refugees 
no one was killed in the incident and younis testified that he 
led the hijacking under orders from the militia 
younis 30 sat impassively as the jury of seven women and five 
men returned a verdict rejecting his defense he faces life 
imprisonment 
minutes after the verdict was announced younis appeared relaxed 
smiling and chatting with his interpreter 
i tried to prepare him said courtappointed defense attorney 
francis d carter he understands what happened he really went 
into the courtroom feeling that it was preordained 
federal officials proclaimed the results an affirmation of a 1984 
law asserting united states jurisdiction over the taking of american 
hostages overseas 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the verdict means that 
those who violate the rights of us citizens are hereby put on 
notice that the american law enforcement system is capable of 
exacting a penalty for these terroristic crimes regardless of where 
they occur 
carter contested the government claim and said he would appeal 
it is an outrage carter said adding that the case was not 
about the united states and the two americans aboard the aircraft 
were not harmed 
carter said he would appeal on grounds the united states ought 
not to have jurisdiction in the case and on grounds the military was 
involved in the arrest 
younis was lured aboard a yacht 13 miles off the coast of cyprus 
in international waters in the mediterranean sea on sept 13 1987 
with the prospect of a drug deal and a party 
he was slammed to the deck by members of the fbi hostage rescue 
squad then interrogated for four days aboard a navy munitions ship 
after he gave a detailed confession he was flown nonstop from the 
deck of an aircraft carrier to washington 
doctors later found he had suffered hairline fractures of both 
wrists during the arrest but during his interrogation the swelling 
was treated only with bags of ice 
mr younis did not expect an awful lot from the united states 
after the means used to arrest him carter said 
younis was convicted on three counts 
seizing hostages with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment 
conspiracy to commit sky piracy with a maximum sentence of five 
years 
hijacking a commercial airliner with a maximum 20 years in 
prison 
he was found innocent on these counts 
using or threatening violence against passengers or crew members 
of a commercial airliner 
destroying a civilian aircraft 
carrying aboard a civilian aircraft devices likely to damage it 
the jury was led from the courthouse under guard by us 
marshals and it was impossible to ask them how they reached their 
verdict 
however prosecution witnesses testified that younis had ordered 
the other hijackers not to harm the passengers and crew members and 
although the prosecution showed the jury a videotape of younis 
announcing the imminent destruction of the plane there was no 
evidence that he planted the explosives or gave an order to blow up 
the 15 million boeing 727 
judge aubrey e robinson jr allowed the defense to call an 
expert witness author helena cobban who testified that a lebanese 
in younis situation would be predisposed to follow orders to 
hijack a plane in 1985 
but the judge gave the jury stern instructions telling them 
hijacking a plane is illegal obeying illegal orders is 
not a defense 
carter said he expected the the judge to issue a sentence in 30 
to 45 days and said he would be reviewing the record of the trial 
to determine further gounds for appeal 
a federal appeals court has already ruled that the arrest while 
not a model of law enforcement was acceptable and that a written 
confession signed by younis could be used against him closing that 
avenue of appeal

eighty percent of the tax benefits from 
president bushs proposed cut in capitalgains taxes would go to 
people with incomes over 100000 a year congressional analysts say 
an estimated 125 million couples and individuals who make more 
than 100000 and report capital gains would get tax cuts averaging 
12315 according to a study by the staff of the joint committee on 
taxation the 376000 with incomes over 200000 would get 60 
percent of the total reduction their cuts averaging 30820 
despite such figures bush on tuesday maintained that his plan is 
not a special tax break for the rich 
the estimates were presented tuesday to the senate finance 
committee which heard the treasury department hail bushs proposal 
as one of the most important things congress could do to ensure 
economic growth 
if this country is to maintain its leadership role in the world 
economy we need to encourage investment and in particular 
investment that is oriented to longterm growth rather than 
shortswing speculation said dennis ross acting assistant 
secretary of the treasury for tax policy 
bush in a speech tuesday to insurance agents defended his plan 
let the critics carp he said im going to push for this idea 
that will stimulate jobs risktaking capital formation and its 
good for the economy and it is not a special tax break for the 
rich 
until 1986 capital gains which are profits from the sale of 
stock real estate and other property were taxed at a lower rate 
than were wages and other income the preferential treatment was 
ended along with several other deductions and exclusions as part 
of the price for cutting basic tax rates across the board 
the bush administration and lawmakers of both parties say it was 
a mistake to repeal the special treatment of capital gains they 
contend such an incentive is necessary to improve the nations 
savings rate 
bush has called for a maximum capitalgains tax rate of 15 
percent down from 33 percent on assets held for more than three 
years he wants single taxpayers with incomes under 10000 couples 
under 20000 to pay zero tax on capital gains 
critics of the proposal raised three arguments against the 
proposal at the finance committee hearing 
restoring a special tax rate for capital gains could lead to 
unraveling of other key parts of the 1986 tax overhaul 
the proposal could cause the public to perceive the tax system 
as weighted in favor of the wealthy 
bushs proposal is unlikely to increase revenues over the long 
run despite predictions of the administration there is a very 
real danger that the presidents proposal would work against our 
longterm effort to reduce the federal deficit because it could 
reduce revenues said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
committee 
the administration argues that a lower capitalgains rate would 
induce so much investment that government tax collections would 
increase by 16 billion over five years the staff of the joint 
committee on taxation calculates the proposal would actually reduce 
collections by 13 billion during the same period 
until a taxpayer sells his asset the rate of tax is zero 
said ross capping the statutory tax rate at 15 percent will cause 
many taxpayers who would otherwise elect a zero tax rate by 
retaining their investments to realize their gains and pay some 
tax 
ronald a pearlman who formerly held rosss position but now is 
chief of staff for the joint committee on taxation said the 
administrations projection is not realistic 
during the seven years ending in 1987 when capitalgains rates 
were cut twice and the stock market was rising taxpayers realized 
1 trillion of capital gains pearlman said for bushs proposal to 
raise revenues permanently gains would have to surpass 2 trillion 
during a fiveyear period pearlman said

adrian cronauer the reallife hero of good 
morning vietnam neither looks nor behaves like comedian robin 
williams in fact hes a fledgling government bureaucrat whose 
baggy eyes and brillogray beard remind some people of robert h 
bork 
cronauer says hes seen the movie five times sure i love 
it he says 
but much of the popular 1987 screen comedy about a fasttalking 
nonconformist yukitup disc jockey in saigon which earned 
williams an oscar nomination is pure hollywood makebelieve 
cronauer says 
yes there was somebody named adrian cronauer he said 
tuesday during a lunch break from his temporary job at the federal 
communications commission 
yes i was a disc jockey in saigon and i went there from 
greece yes i did teach english in my offduty time yes i did try 
to make it sound more like a stateside station yes i did have 
problems with news censorship yes i was in a restaurant shortly 
before the viet cong hit it and yes i did start each program by 
yelling good morning vietnam 
the rest is what he delicately calls good script crafting 
welcome to the real world he says surprise 
after 36 years in radio and television including a fouryear 
stint as an air force disc jockey cronauer entered law school at 
the university of pennsylvania in 1986 with his eyes on a new career 
in communications law 
to find out how the sausage is really made by a government 
regulatory agency cronauer 50 is working as a student intern at 
the fcc doing legal research for commissioner patricia diaz dennis 
he expects to get his law degree next january 
cronauer chuckles at the disparity between his buttoneddown 
lifestyle and his screen image as a rebellious disc jockey who once 
bucked the us military establishment in saigon by playing rock n 
roll instead of lawrence welk on his armed forces radio morning show 
in the mid1960s 
in many ways im a very conservative guy he said a 
lifelong cardcarrying republican cant be that much of an 
antiestablishment type 
friends still send cronauer newspaper clippings with photos of 
bork the lookalike conservative judge whose supreme court 
nomination was killed by the senate the notes scrawled in the 
margin read hey does this guy look familiar to you 
cronauer is a bork defender and in his frequent lectures on 
college campuses where the movie has made him a celebrity cronauer 
is critical of us conduct of the vietnam war 
we never lost the war militarily we lost it politically he 
said if theres any lesson to be learned from vietnam if god 
forbid we ever get involved in any kind of a conflict again wed 
better be damned sure we have support on the home front politically 
so we dont just go in to fight it but to win it

while presidents traditionally have quoted 
illustrious predecessors president bush has been sprinkling his 
speeches with the observations of winston churchill yogi berra and 
woody allen 
bush whose own syntax is sometimes a trifle fractured seems 
most at home quoting berra often repeating the baseball luminarys 
contention that you can observe a lot by just watching 
that master linguist oh i love to quote yogi bush told 
a recent audience of college students 
the president often injects berra quotes into his prepared 
speeches much as he did during his presidential campaign joking 
with audiences about pairing off in threes 
during his campaign bush frequently borrowed berras it seems 
like deja vu all over again and told of how no one frequents 
a particular restaurant any more because the lines to get in are 
so long 
president reagan often quoted former democratic presidents 
franklin roosevelt and john f kennedy and authors famous and 
notsofamous 
bush seldom quotes literary figures or democratic presidents 
when it comes to former chief executives he shows a clear 
preference for republicans abraham lincoln and theodore roosevelt 
but most of all he quotes churchill when hes not quoting 
berra 
he told the united negro college fund as an undergraduate i 
came to grasp what churchill talked about when he said personally 
i am always ready to learn though i do not always enjoy being 
taught 
and in his budget message to congress we shall not fail or 
falter we shall not weaken or tire give us the tools and we will 
finish the job 
those are among the dozen or so references to churchill that have 
cropped up in recent bush speeches 
sometimes he alludes to churchill but doesnt quite get the 
whole quote out 
for instance in a speech to state legislators in the white house 
last week bush said as britain faced an adversary that tested 
the courage and character of its people winston churchill vowed 
never to surrender 
that was it then later in the same speech to paraphrase 
churchill again we shall not flag or fail 
bush speech writer robert grady said the president admired 
churchill and that the late british prime minister was such a 
gifted speaker that many of his phrases fit naturally into the 
presidents speeches 
grady said bush quotes lincoln and teddy roosevelt a lot because 
they fit in with his agenda lincoln for the politics of 
inclusion and roosevelt because of his devotion to the environment 
but yogi berra 
hes been quoting yogi berra for a long time brady said 
hes very much a favorite of the presidents the speech writer 
suggested that part of it might be bushs background as captain of 
the yale university baseball team in 1948 
usually bush ad libs his own berra lines but sometimes speech 
writers put them in for him grady said 
audiences usually laugh when bush quotes berra but hes had less 
luck so far with woody allen 
in a speech to drug enforcement agents in new york last week 
bush said perhaps you heard woody allens wry observation 
organized crime in america takes in over 40 billion a year and 
spends very little on office supplies 
the remark was greeted by silence 
philosopher that he is bush added sheepishly

there are about 8000 requests in at the moment fitzwater said 
millie is progressing quite well the president is watching her 
condition fitzwater said 
the progress of the presidential pooch has been an item of key 
concern for the bush family in recent days 
in a speech in new york last week the president said he had to 
rush back to washington because the senate is still in session and 
my dog is pregnant 
and he told an audience earlier this week if i look a little 
frantic our dog is expecting and if you think i look frantic you 
ought to see the silver fox 
after some laughter bush added by way of elaboration thats

secretary of state james a baker iii says the 
administration is looking into removing the dependents of us 
citizens working in panama where americans have been targets of 
harassment 
baker made the comments after hearing complaints from rep 
william lehman dfla on tuesday about difficulties faced by both 
us officials in panama and workers at the panama canal 
there is a lot of serious potential there for conflict for 
bloodshed and for the complete breakdown of the panama canal 
operation lehman claimed i dont think the american people are 
aware of this crisis in the canal area 
lehman who chairs the house appropriations transportation 
subcommittee spoke at a foreign operations subcommittee hearing 
last month the us military command headquarters in panama said 
in a statement that during the first six weeks of this year 
panamas defense forces have stopped searched rerouted detained 
or impounded more us government vehicles than in the previous 
eight months 
uspanamanian relations have deteriorated since 1987 gen 
manuel noriega the countrys strongman is under indictment in 
florida for drug trafficking 
in recent months the number of official us personnel from 
various government agencies has been scaled back 
lehman told baker of an incident earlier this month when 
panamanian police who are part of noriegas defense forces stopped 
nine buses carrying about 100 american school children the police 
who stopped the buses for about three hours complained the vehicles 
did not have proper license plates 
lehman also cited other incidents of harassment directed against 
panamanians who work at the canal such as with car licenses 
lehman asked if the administration has a fallback position or 
policy in case chaos breaks out 
baker replied that the administration will take whatever steps 
necessary to protect us citizens and the canal but added that 
uspanamanian relations will not be normalized until noriega is 
removed from power 
asked if the administration was considering removing dependents 
from the area baker replied thats being looked into 
noting that elections are set in panama for in may baker 
commented that noriega is unpopular with many panamanians 
i think that there is some reasonable chance that if a 
semifair election is held that the opposition could win the 
election baker said adding but if he steals that 
election hell be even more unpopular 
the united states does not recognize the legitimacy of the 
panamanian government it continues to recognize as the legitimate 
authority ousted president eric arturo delvalle who was deposed 
last february in a coup led by followers of defense chief manuel 
antonio noriega 
the united states has about 1000 military personnel in panama to 
defend the panama canal of the about 8000 employees who work at 
the canal the overwhelming majority are panamanian

his trip vouchers to the rules committee a spokesman for the 
panels chairman says 
giugni accepted the arrangement suggested by rules committee 
chairman wendell ford the kentucky democrats spokesman phil 
norman said tuesday 
giugni also agreed to reimburse the senate for some of his 
wideranging travel in 1987 and 1988 according to a letter from 
ford to giugni 
the amount of giugnis reimbursement was not clear tuesday and 
attempts to reach the senates secondranking staff official were 
unsuccessful

expenses after news stories revealed he had taken a dozen 
taxpayerfinanced trips in 198788 at least half of them to his 
native hawaii 
ford in a march 8 letter that became public this week wrote 
giugni i concur in your proposal to reimburse the senate for a 
portion of your travel expenses 
ford said that all of giugnis claims could be justified in a 
legal sense but wrote that some of them might be questioned and 
require additional explanation 
but your decision avoids any appearance of impropriety ford 
said in commending giugni for his decision 
giugni said last week that he conducted official business on all 
of the trips mostly to inspect senators homestate offices giugni 
said trips that included nonsenate business were only partially 
billed to taxpayers

in an apparent attempt to derail the political 
comeback of boris yeltsin the communist party has released a 
transcript of yeltsins remarks at a 1987 party meeting that cost 
him his job as moscow party boss 
the political maverick is a candidate for a seat in a new 
national assembly that is to be chosen this month 
according to a transcript released tuesday of the fateful 
closeddoor central committee meeting yeltsin told the gathering 
that president mikhail s gorbachev had become the object of 
intolerable glorification 
yeltsin was named moscow party chief in december 1985 and a 
nonvoting politburo member two months later he lost those posts as 
a result of his remarks at the oct 21 1987 meeting 
the party said it was publishing a transcript of the meeting in 
its new monthly journal news of the communist party central 
committee because of requests by workers and party members 
but a us specialist said the release of 40 pages of scathing 
attacks on yeltsin by gorbachev and other leaders appeared designed 
to hurt the 58yearold yeltsin in his bid for political office 
the transcript showed yeltsin now campaigning in the march 26 
elections that will choose the membership of a national assembly 
criticized not only gorbachev who brought him into the kremlin 
leadership but yegor k ligachev a conservative force on the 
ruling politburo 
jerry hough a political scientist at duke university and the 
brookings institution said in an interview that other motives were 
at work 
its aimed at discrediting yeltsin said hough in moscow to 
attend seminars with american correspondents he said the transcript 
was damning for yeltsin because it portrays him as inept just as 
he is trying to win a seat in the new congress of peoples deputies 
at the central committee meeting yeltsin said that despite 
promises of improvements from gorbachevs reforms nothing has 
changed from the point of view of the style of work of the central 
committee secretariat and the style of work of comrade ligachev 
yeltsin said that since gorbachev took power in 1985 and launched 
his perestroika program of social and economic reforms the 
peoples mood had risen and fallen like a wave 
he complained of an an increase as i would put it of the 
glorification of the general secretary by some politburo members i 
think that right now this is just intolerable 
gorbachev invited comments from the 300plus central committee 
members on yeltsins speech 
ligachev took the floor and called yeltsins remarks pure 
slander that were absolutely without proof 
speaker after speaker blasted yeltsin accusing him of political 
immaturity challenging his assertion the public was disenchanted 
with perestroika and saying living conditions in moscow had 
worsened since he became the capitals party chief 
after more than three hours of criticism yeltsin defended his 
claim that gorbachev was being glorified but added a clarification 
i believe that this is from the soul but all the same probably 
it is not for the general good 
gorbachev then interrupted and suggested yeltsin was implying a 
personality cult had formed around the kremlin chief a 
powerful accusation in the soviet union where the term is used to 
describe stalins dictatorship 
gorbachev said yeltsin implied the politburo had not learned the 
dangers of a personality cult 
is it not enough for you that only moscow revolves around your 
person is it necessary for the central committee as well to occupy 
itself with you gorbachev asked have you reached such heights 
of selfadmiration and is your opinion of yourself such that you put 
your ambitions above those of the party our affairs 
yeltsin finally said he agreed with the criticism regretted 
speaking and requested to be relieved of his posts 
over the next six months yeltsin was removed as moscow party 
chief from the ruling politburo and from the presidium of the 
supreme soviet or parliament 
he remains a member of the central committee and a first deputy 
chairman of the state building committee which gives him the rank 
of minister

a federal survey says the nation is housing 
more homeless people than ever particularly families but it offers 
no estimate of the total number of homeless americans 
the department of housing and urban development study released 
tuesday said spending on homeless shelters has increased more than 
fivefold to more than 15 billion annually since a similar hud 
study in 1984 
it said the number of shelters and shelter beds had nearly 
tripled since then 
the study was released as president bush called homelessness a 
national shame and vowed to step up the search for solutions 
he said he was troubled by ragged pathetic figures huddled over 
steam grates near the white house 
hud secretary jack kemp said the study shows that americas 
efforts to shelter the homeless are beginning to bear results and 
that it is very much a grass roots campaign characterized by local 
and private intitatives 
the hud study reported a largescale private effort to aid the 
homeless with nine of every 10 shelters around the nation operated 
by private nonprofit groups twothirds of the operating funds 
come from local state and federal governments it said 
huds findings were based on a survey of a sampling of homeless 
shelter managers 
the department did not offer an estimate of the total homeless 
population in its 1984 study hud estimated the figure at 250000 
to 350000 people a figure that homeless advocates criticized as 
too low 
the new study estimated there were 5400 homeless shelters in the 
nation in 1988 up from 1900 in 1984 total bed capacity was 
estimated at 275000 up from 100000 
the study found a twothirds occupancy rate overall and placed 
the average occupancy per night in homeless shelters at 180000 the 
figure was 70000 in the earlier study 
occupancy rates varied greatly by size city and type of homeless 
shelter as well as the weather 
about onefourth of the shelters were reported full all year 
round shelters set up primarily to handle families with children 
showed the highest average of nights at full capacity 259 days a 
year 
almost half the shelter managers surveyed reported having to turn 
away at least one person on an average night because of lack of 
space although most were referred to other shelters 
the survey concluded that the types of people staying at homeless 
shelters has changed 
while both families and unaccompanied men are increasing among 
the sheltered homeless families are increasing more rapidly it 
said unaccompanied men no longer represent the majority of the 
sheltered homeless 
the percentage of those sheltered who are members of families was 
put at 40 percent nearly twice the 21 percentage figure in 1984 in 
actual numbers the family members receiving shelter quadrupled over 
the past four years to more than 60000 
threequarters of those were single parents with children the 
remainder was divided equally between couples with children and 
couples without children 
the study said onefourth of those in the shelters are children 
in big cities children make up almost onethird of those in 
shelters 
the proportion of unaccompanied women in shelters was unchanged 
at 14 percent but their actual numbers increased 180 percent the 
report said that category included victims of domestic violence and 
socalled bag ladies 
shelter populations also changed in racial makeup in 1984 
nearly three out of five were white and in 1988 the proportion was 
reversed it found 58 percent on an average night were minorities 
most of whom were black 
shelter managers estimated that 33 percent of their clients had 
problems with alcoholism 34 percent with mental illness and 25 
percent with drug abuse 
hud estimated that 80000 people contributed 30 million hours of 
time a year to the shelters 
hud surveyed 205 shelter managers and administrators of voucher 
programs for the homeless in 65 cities and towns with populations of 
25000 or more conducted by telephone and extrapolated the results 
for the entire nation

food and drug administration officials say 
intensive testing of imported chilean fruit will continue until they 
are satisfied that produce from the south american country is safe 
from poisoning attempts 
hundreds of food inspectors are at work in philadelphia miami 
new york and los angeles the ports where fruit from chile arrives 
in the united states officials said 
until we know where we are going it would be pure speculation 
to indicate any time frame for ending the steppedup testing 
program said fred shank acting deputy director of the fdas center 
for food safety 
what we are doing is pouring all of our available resources 
into looking at the produce that is at the docks at the present 
time he said we are also in the process of developing a 
program to ensure that the produce is safe for reentry into the 
market he added but would not elaborate 
fda commissioner frank young met with white house aides on 
tuesday and told reporters that us officials will meet with 
representatives of the chilean fruit growers also the government of 
chile the fda fbi and well get a joint strategy we hope to do 
that soon 
traces of cyanide were found in two seedless red grapes tested at 
the port in philadelphia on sunday and on monday the fda warned 
consumers not to eat any chilean fruit and to throw out any fruit 
left in their refrigerator unless they were certain it did not come 
from chile 
meanwhile us and chilean authorities were trying to determine 
the source of the cyanide which was found after a poisoning threat 
was telephoned to the us embassy in the chilean capital of 
santiago on march 2 the caller a man speaking in spanish 
threatened to poison export fruit 
the fda began precautionary testing but four days later 
officials investigating the threat said it appeared to be a hoax 
however on march 8 another call was received by the embassy saying 
it was not a hoax young said 
although there has been no public word on a motive in the case a 
bush administration source knowledgeable about the investigation 
said the first message did suggest they were trying to call 
attention to the poverty in chile the source spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
at fdas urging supermarkets moved quickly to remove all chilean 
fruit from their shelves and distributors held produce from the 
south american country in warehouses until further testing could be 
done virtually all grapes sold at this time of year in us markets 
are from chile 
canadian officials also urged that chilean fruit be removed from 
stores in canada additionally news reports in japan said the 
japanese embassy in santiago had received a similar poisoning 
threat and japanese officials have halted chilean fruit imports 
the moves could have a devastating effecton the chilean economy 
the chilean fruit association said chile exports about 880 million 
pounds of fruit worth about 900 million to the united states from 
dec 1 through april 
losses at new york citys hunts point fresh produce market alone 
would be in the millions of dollars and could be incalculable 
said tom kovacevich chairman of the new york produce trade 
association 
a los angeles produce importer gobbled chilean grapes at a news 
conference tuesday to dramatize his claim that the fruit is safe and 
the government is ruining a booming industry unnecessarily 
i think its a major major overreaction rick eastes 
general manager of the david oppenheimer california importer said 
of the fda advisory an industry worth 750 million in the united 
states and canada has been brought to a standstill we have been 
assassinated by insinuation 
the levels of cyanide in each of two grapes in which it was 
confirmed were very low 0003 milligrams each said fda spokesman 
bill grigg however the fda could not determine how much cyanide 
had been originally introduced since the poison dissipates in the 
acidic environment of the fruit he said 
a level of 200 milligrams is considered a lethal dosage for an 
adult and 25 milligrams would make an adult sick he said an adult 
who ate a dozen grapes each containing the level of cyanide found in 
the contaminated samples probably wouldnt even notice it he 
said 
but i wouldnt risk it because one might be spiked a lot higher 
than another we just dont know if the motivation of the people 
who made the threat was to hurt people or to call attention to a 
problem

the house armed services committee has 
overwhelmingly backed a military base closing plan supporting 
chairman les aspins prediction that the full house will go along 
the committee voted 434 tuesday to support recommendations of 
the independent commission on base realignment and closure which 
proposed that 145 military facilities either be shut down have 
their operations reduced or their mission changed 
both houses must disapprove the entire list of recommendations to 
stop them the deadline for voting under will be in may with the 
exact date to be determined by the number of days each house is in 
session 
aspin dwis said after the commissions recommendation was 
released last dec 29 i fully expect the congress to support this 
package 
he said that while two dozen house members districts were 
affected more than 100 others who feared base closings were are 
breathing a sigh of relief 
they now have a vested interest in approval of the list 
because it will give the bases in their areas at least a decades 
breather aspin said 
the last batch of closings occurred in 1977 
tuesday aspin said from the information weve gotten the 
commission has done a reasonable job rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo chairman of the military installations subcommittee added 
it does appear a reasonable prudent commission has reached these 
decisions 
voting against the commission were reps jim courter rnj 
larry hopkins rky frank mccloskey dind and lane evans dill 
evans has been upset with the proposed closing of chanute air 
force base in illinois while hopkins and others who supported the 
commission were angry with what they called pentagon stonewalling 
on congressional requests for justification of the proposals 
courter said the plan to place fort dix nj on a semiactive 
status would end its basic training mission without permitting 
nonmilitary use of the facility mccloskey warned of substantial 
environmental cleanup costs if the jefferson proving ground in 
indiana is closed 
the commission said its recommendations could save an estimated 
694 million a year with 20year savings estimated at 56 billion 
while a number of lawmakers said the savings would disappear because 
of environmental cleanup costs the law establishing the commission 
told the panel not to consider such expenses 
the pentagon already had been required to clean up hazardous 
waste at military installations 
the senate armed services committee held a hearing on the 
commission plan tuesday former defense secretary frank c carlucci 
said the military services did not indicate to me they had a 
problem with any part of the recommendation 
but sen alan j dixon dill a member of the senate armed 
services committee said the recommendations would result in an 
american tragedy for those thrown out of work in places such as 
chanute 
dixon said the point system used to decide the fate of chanute 
was based on incorrect assumptions about the bases facilities 
the commission last dec 29 proposed closing 86 facilities 
partially closing five others and changing the mission in 54 other 
installations

regional airlines from maine to puerto rico that 
depend on ties to eastern airlines are taking a bumpy ride trying to 
weather the loss of business caused by the machinists strike 
in new hampshire a commuter line suspended operations and the 
governor of vermont has asked the federal government for help 
thats what happens when these carriers get in bed with a weak 
or poorly run major partner michael boyd an analyst at regional 
airline management systems said tuesday from golden colo 
because of the consolidation of the industry if one player 
goes down they take a lot more players down with them than they 
used to 
commuter lines hurt by the 1weekold eastern strike go by such 
names as precision airlines and eastern metro express they provide 
linking flights up and down the east coast to maine marthas 
vineyard philadelphia atlanta puerto rico and the virgin islands 
among other stops 
their connection to eastern is more than simply moving passengers 
from a major air route to its lesstraveled tributaries many of the 
commuter and regional lines depend on eastern to take their 
reservations print their tickets and act as a clearinghouse for 
fare money 
since the eastern machinists union strike began march 4 
triggering walkouts by its pilots and flight attendants the airline 
has reduced the number of its reservation clerks and because 
eastern filed for federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors 
last week the cash due the commuter lines from its tickets could be 
held up for weeks 
when the bankruptcy was filed those funds got all tangled 
up boyd said when you run a commuter airline you run pretty 
close to the vest 
one of the hardest hit was precision airlines of manchester 
nh which runs flights out of new hampshire and vermont last 
weekend precision suspended all operations for at least three weeks 
and furloughed 350 workers citing a 70 percent drop in passenger 
traffic 
this has occurred in spite of a massive public relations 
campaign to make the public aware that precision airlines was 
independently owned and continued to operate its 145 daily 
flights the company said in a statement 
the move prompted vermont gov madeleine kunin to ask the federal 
aviation administration for help in restoring air service 
in maine bangorbased bar harbor airways inc had been relying 
on the reservation system and connecting flights of eastern and 
faced a possible 30 percent decline in its passengers due to the 
strike 
but because bar harbor is owned by texas air corp parent 
company of eastern and continental airlines it was able to recover 
some of the business it lost from eastern by diverting all its 
resources to the continental system according to steven mason bar 
harbors marketing director 
when the strike began and pilots did not cross picket lines 
the first effect was we immediately began to miss connecting 
traffic mason said the ability to expand on the continental 
express commuter service did come as a relief 
the impact has been similar further south within days of the 
strike eastern had canceled its atlanta runs 
we were hurt substantially by the eastern strike said robert 
e phillips president of eastern metro express in atlanta a 
subsidiary of one of the countrys biggest regional carriers metro

the discovery of poisoned grapes from chile has 
raised questions among government and industry analysts about the 
potential impact on the growth of fruit and vegetable imports 
about 30 percent of the fruit and vegetables eaten by americans 
are imported 
the agriculture department said tuesday that grape imports from 
chile grew to about 260000 tons in 1988 from 213000 in 1987 
just 10 years ago in 1979 only 33000 tons of chilean grapes 
were imported the department said 
removal of chilean grapes and other fruit from american food 
stores following discovery of two grapes bearing traces of cyanide 
is bound to be felt in the food industry but the extent of damage is 
hard to determine said john mcclung of the united fruit and 
vegetable association a trade group 
we dont know how long this is going to go on mcclung said 
its too soon to tell the economic impact but the potential is 
considerable both in chile and the united states 
mcclung said americans annually import about 30 percent of the 
fruit and vegetables they consume most of it in the form of fresh 
produce such as bananas grapes apples and tomatoes 
chile is the big supplier of fruit mcclung said in 
vegetables its mainly mexico 
the agriculture department says us fresh fruit imports alone 
reached almost 362 million metric tons in 1987 up about 2 percent 
from 356 million tons in 1986 a metric ton is about 2205 pounds 
bananas made up 81 percent of the 1987 fresh fruit imports 
followed by grapes with 69 percent and apples with 37 percent 
the bananas came mostly from ecuador colombia and the socalled 
caribbean basin initiative countries of honduras costa rica 
panama guatemala and the bahamas grapes mostly were from chile 
and apples from canada chile and new zealand 
a 1983 law gave 27 countries in the caribbean basin duty free 
access to us markets for 12 years 
chile has passed south africa australia and argentina to become 
the leading supplier of fresh fruit to north america and europe 
during the northern hemispheres winter months 
about 75 percent of chiles grapes are shipped to the united 
states and a large percentage of its apples go to europe but some 
apples also go to the united states where they compete with the 
domestic crop pears are another major chilean item for the us 
market according to usda analysts 
chile has a climate somewhat like ours mcclung said in an 
interview its not a tropical climate so theyre able to produce 
stone fruit like peaches nectarines plums that kind of fruit and 
those are popular in this country 
mcclung said the trade was stunned by what happened to the 
chilean grapes and was at a loss to speculate on what may happen 
next 
honestly im unaware of anything like this from any place 
ever he said but i suppose if someone is intent on a criminal 
or terrorist act regarding the tainting of produce it can probably 
be accomplished 
at the usda analyst ben w huang of the departments economic 
research service said it was too early to say what impact the 
incident may have on us food supplies 
john j vansickle of the university of florida said in a report 
just issued by the usda that florida vegetable growers are concerned 
about competition from the caribbean initiative countries 
florida and mexico have long battled for supremacy in the 
winter fresh vegetable industry he said 
vansickle said floridas share of the winter vegetable market has 
grown only in tomatoes rising to 519 percent of us consumption 
in 198687 from 424 percent in 197576 
floridas share of the eggplant market remained fairly stable 
while the share of all other commodities fell with bell peppers 
cucumbers beans and squash each falling between 10 percent and 198 
percent he said 
even so floridas actual production of these vegetables has 
increased with the exception of beans vansickle said the decline 
in the shares of the us market shows the tremendous growth that 
has taken place in consumption 
another usda report said the 1988 drought did not affect consumer 
prices of fresh vegetables this winter noting that most are grown 
under irrigation in florida or california 
many winter fresh tomatoes peppers green beans cucumbers 
squash and eggplant are imported from mexico the report said 
but us apple production dropped 17 percent last year partly 
because of the drought and retail prices are up this winter the 
report said production in washington the leading apple state fell 
26 percent from 1987 
winter supplies of fresh soft fruits such as peaches grapes 
apricots plums and nectarines are imported from southern hemisphere 
countries mostly chile the report noted

at least 30000 russians and other nonestonians 
marched in the baltic republics capital of tallinn threatening a 
general strike if the communist party does not halt a surge of 
nationalist reform journalists said 
tuesdays protest was organized by interfront a group dominated 
by ethnic russians that claims the 420000 ethnic russians in the 
republic are discriminated against by the ethnic estonian majority 
estonias parliament using the greater autonomy granted local 
lawmakers under president mikhail s gorbachev voted jan 18 to 
require nonestonians who work in jobs where they come into contact 
with the public to learn estonian in four years or face dismissal 
interfront wants russian to be granted the status of an official 
state language in estonia on par with estonian 
in the estonian communist partys daily newspaper sovietskaya 
estonia the group had called for people to demonstrate against 
creeping counterrevolution undermining socialism in estonia and in 
the baltic region of the ussr 
ethnic estonians make up 65 percent of the republics 15 million 
inhabitants with ethnic russians totaling 28 percent 
maarika saarna a reporter with state estonian radio estimated 
30000 demonstrators marched police said 50000 people turned out 
finnish radio said from tasllinn that interfront guaranteed a 
large turnout in tuesdays demonstration by starting the march 
directly from factories during working hours 
workers had no choice but to follow their leaders the radio said 
speaking by telephone from tallinn ms saarna said 
russianlanguage schools in tallinn were given the day off and 
nonestonian residents of the baltic republics northeast were 
brought in to the capital to swell the number of marchers 
at a rally held later outside city hall speakers demanded an 
emergency meeting in april of the estonian partys policymaking 
central committee to halt bourgeois nationalism and 
counterrevolution ms saarna said 
speakers also objected to the decision of estonias party and 
government to fly the baltic states old flag which had long been 
illegal under soviet rule from the highest medieval castle tower in 
tallinn she said 
the blue black and white standard was hoisted at gherman tower 
on feb 24 71 years after estonia declared its independence 
estonia like its neighbors latvia and lithuania was forcibly 
absorbed by the kremlin in 1940 
the flag remains a powerful symbol of its shortlived 
independence 
ms saarna said interfront members warned that if they did not 
hear within two weeks that their demands had been met they would 
stage a twohour strike on april 3 and a daylong work stoppage a 
week later

the nuclear industry and many health scientists 
strongly favor a proposal to end federal controls on some lowlevel 
radioactive waste but government records show much of the general 
public is alarmed at the prospect 
i dont want to die of cancer because you allowed somebody to 
dump lowlevel waste near my home school or water source lisa 
brown of corvallis ore wrote in a recent letter to the nuclear 
regulatory commission 
the environmental protection agency also has stated its 
opposition to the nrc plan 
the commission is evaluating the hundreds of written responses it 
has received to a proposal published last december to end regulation 
of wastes from nuclear plants medical research recycled metals 
and consumer products which emit radiation at levels so low as to 
be deemed acceptable risks to public health 
the commission proposed setting the limit at 10 millirems per 
year per person by comparison radiation from a single xray is 
about 30 millirems and the average american is exposed to between 
200 millirems and 300 millirems a year from natural background 
radiation not counting xrays 
in its proposal the nrc said there is no clear consensus 
based on existing scientific data on exactly what level of 
radiation exposure should be considered an acceptable risk congress 
in 1985 instructed the nrc to set such a limit 
the commission said the risk of cancer death associated with 
exposure to 10 millirems per year is two in 1 million a level of 
risk even five times greater than this would be of little concern 
to most members of society it said 
of those writing to express a view on the proposal nuclear 
utilities and scientists were uniformly in favor although some 
disagreed on the exact level of acceptable exposure 
john j kearney writing on behalf of the health physics 
committee of the edison electric institute proposed a dose limit of 
as high as 20 millirems per year 
the associated risks if any are quite small compared to other 
actual risks an individual faces every day he wrote his group is 
an electric utility trade group 
many private individuals however said they were troubled at the 
prospect of allowing producers of toxic wastes to dispose of it 
without federal controls 
it is beyond belief that instead of being more vigilant with 
protecting us from radioactive poison you are pursuing a policy to 
allow more radioactive materials to enter our soil and water 
dolores m moran of avon lake ohio wrote 
we certainly cannot look to the waste generators to regulate 
themselves wrote linda dangelo of lincoln neb 
the epa in a letter signed by richard e sanderson director of 
the office of federal activities said it was troubled by several 
aspects of the proposal including doubts about safety and 
compatibility with epas wastecontrol authority 
we do not believe the policy would adequately protect public 
health and the quality of mans environment the epa letter said 
many environmental groups have strongly criticized the proposal 
the public citizen group founded by ralph nader has accused the nrc 
of bowing to nuclear industry pressure to help reduce the cost of 
disposing of radioactive wastes it contends the measure if 
adopted would cut those costs by 1 billion over 20 years 
notwithstanding that there is no safe level of radiation 
exposure this policy would allow nuclear waste to be disposed of in 
your local garbage dump like banana peels and coffee grounds said 
scott saleska a public citizen nuclear waste specialist 
although the majority of letters received by the nrc from private 
individuals expressed opposition to the proposal some others said 
safety concerns were overblown 
i feel society has an unhealthy obsession about zero risk

toxic chemicals blown from distant sites are 
disrupting the life cycle of birds on the great lakes and the 
plight of the water fowl has worsened dramatically in recent years 
according to research released by environmentalists 
in a broad sense these chemicals are eliminating the diversity 
in the great lakes said james p ludwig a consulting ecologist 
from bay city mich at a news conference tuesday we have a few 
species but the elegance is gone 
ludwig surveyed thousands of bird eggs and hatchlings in the 
northern lakes and found sharp increases in deformities such as 
malformed hips club feet eye abnormalities and body organs 
attached outside the birds at birth 
to demonstrate the effects of pollution the researchers 
displayed at the news conference a live cormorant with a twisted 
beak the bird which was found on naubinway island mich in 
northern lake michigan may eventually be placed in a petting zoo 
a 198688 survey of water bird eggs in the upper great lakes 
region found deformities in caspian terns occurring 31 times more 
frequently than in the late 1960s and early 1970s ludwig said 
even low levels of contamination produced effects in the great 
lakes food chain ludwig said 
his research included birds nesting in highly contaminated areas 
such as saginaw bay in eastern michigan 
many contaminants are blown into the lakes from many hundreds of 
miles away an ecologist said in describing research last year on 
isle royal mich an island in lake superior 
deborah swackhammer an ecologist with the university of 
minnesota studied fish in siskiwit lake on the island and found 
concentrations of the toxic chemical polychlorinated biphenyl 
the pcb could only have reached the lake from the air since the 
lakes level is above that of surrounding lake superior she said 
not only is every fish in the great lakes contaminated by 
chemicals to some extent but anything that consumes those fish is 
also contaminated to some extent including people she said 
the research was released as part of a lobbying effort by the 
sierra club

an arm of the department of health and human 
services is warning local aids programs they could lose federal 
money if they support needleexchange programs even though the head 
of hhs has more recently endorsed such programs 
the warning was contained in a memo from the national institute 
of drug abuse the memo went out about two weeks before hhs 
secretary louis sullivan endorsed local programs that let drug 
addicts trade their used needles for clean ones to stem the spread 
of aids 
sullivan whose department includes the public health service 
which oversees the institute also said the federal government could 
provide information and personnel to such programs 
but public health service spokesman james brown denied a conflict 
between the memo and sullivans comments he said the policies of 
both the service and the white house prohibit use of federal funds 
for needleexchange programs but if that policy were changed the 
department could provide such federal support 
you could do it which is what sullivan said brown said 
were not doing it and nida the institute is telling people 
were not going to do it 
asked about the policies sullivans spokesman campbell gardett 
said were in an inbetween period when an awful lot has to be 
worked out its a controversial enough thing that its 
eventually going to come down to bush 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters friday the 
president is opposed to exchangeable needles under any condition 
sullivan in an interview with the ap two days before that said 
he did not subscribe to the view that cleanneedle programs 
condone drug abuse of such programs he said we would be very 
supportive of such efforts in communities that want such programs 
the feb 19 institute memo obtained by the associated press 
told 41 institutefunded aids programs that public health service 
policy prohibits any kind of federal support for programs that 
distribute clean needles to addicts to help stop the spread of the 
deadly virus 
the author of the memo barry s brown chief of community 
research at the institute told the 41 affected programs that 
federal aid would be denied to anyone who is engaged in or who 
supports needleexchange programs 
in part the memo said 
it should be clearly understood by all nida institute 
grantees and contractors that it is against nida and public health 
service phs policy to provide any kind of federal support to 
programs involving the making available of new or cleaned needles or 
providing a needle exchange program anyone receiving nida funds who 
is engaged in or who supports activity prohibited by the phs will 
face prompt action to suspend that programs funding 
brown said that he had written the memo after someone running one 
of the projects raised the needleexchange issue and that he had 
subsequently gotten a couple of calls about his directive 
brown said that after he explained to the callers that the 
support referred to in the memo was federal financial aid they 
went away satisfied 
billi odegaard director of the multnomah county health division 
which serves portland ore and is receiving about 1 million in 
institute funds this year for its aids project said the memo at 
first sounded extreme 
but she said brown explained to one of her colleagues that 
were ok under that policy as long as were not directly 
operating a needleexchange program 
still officials of a portland community group outside in are 
concerned the directive could hamper their efforts to start a 
needleexchange program which they had hoped to coordinate with the 
multnomah project 
were worried about whether they can continue to be supportive 
and to what degree said kathy oliver director of outside in 
brown the research chief said an institutefunded program could 
subcontract with a needleexchange program as long as the federal 
funds werent mixed with the needleexchange money he also said 
that while someone paid from institute funds could not spend their 
federallypaid time coordinating or advising a needleexchange 
program they could do so on his or her own time 
it is unclear how much discretion sullivan has in changing policy 
within his department 
congress last year passed legislation that prevents certain 
federal funds from being used on needleexchange programs another 
law passed last year gives the surgeon general authority to use 
federal funds on a demonstration needleexchange project 
surgeon general c everett koop who runs the public health 
service has said he supports needleexchange trials to study how 
effective such programs could be however he hasnt proposed a 
federal program

a judge today ordered the government to pay an 
estimated 3 million to residents who complained that noisy flights 
by us military planes kept them awake at night 
the decision came almost seven years after 599 residents filed 
the suit seeking 23 million in compensation and a ban on night 
flights by the us air force 
residents said the sound of jets taking off and landing at yokota 
air base west of tokyo had caused chronic sleeplessness and hearing 
problems 
tokyo district judge takeshi ochiai ruled that the noise levels 
exceeded acceptable levels and ordered the government to pay 
each resident living near the base between about 18 and 11000 
each depending on the degree of noise pollution 
but ochiai refused to grant the residents demand to ban the 
flights between 900 pm and 700 am 
he said he could not order the government to halt the flights 
because yokota base is under the jurisdiction of the us military 
the court also dismissed the residents demand for future 
compensation for potential damages 
kyodo news service said plaintiffs attorneys estimated the total 
compensation from the government to be about 3 million 
under a usjapan mutual security treaty japan provides land 
and pays some of the costs for us troops stationed in the country 
residents living near yokota air base filed two earlier damage 
suits for noise pollution in 1976 and 1977 one case with 41 
plaintiffs is under appeal to the supreme court 
in that case and another involving 107 plaintiffs the tokyo high 
court rejected requests for a ban on nighttime flights but awarded 
damages to the plaintiffs 
the court ruled that national defense takes precedence over other 
fields of administration in promoting the public interest even in 
peacetime and that therefore citizens should endure inconveniences 
caused by military facilities

a record 107 billion in deposit withdrawals 
from savings and loan institutions underscores the industrys 
increasing vulnerability to rising interest rates analysts say 
it means basically 1989 is going to be a lousy year unless we 
see a dramatic downturn in shortterm interest rates said bert 
ely an alexandria va financial institutions consultant 
the federal home loan bank board reported tuesday that 80 percent 
of the nations 2945 sampls experienced net withdrawals in january 
the total in one month exceeded net withdrawals for all of 1988 
which were 86 billion 
james barth the bank boards chief economist said a preliminary 
estimate shows withdrawals easing only slightly in february to 
between 8 billion and 9 billion 
barth attributed the bulk of the withdrawals to the failure of 
sampls to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors 
principally money market mutual funds which in january paid 
interest 125 percentage points higher than sampl threemonth 
certificates of deposit 
ely said much of the sampl deposit runoff has been voluntary in the 
sense that thrift institutions could raise interest rates and draw 
in more money but sooner or later sampls will be forced to offer 
higher interest rates and as that happens sampls losses which last 
year were the worst since the great depression will deepen he said 
the industry is going to suffer in the same way it did in the 
early 1980s when interest rates soared above 20 percent but not in 
the same magnitude he said 
the problem is that sampls are forced to increase the rates paid on 
deposits faster than rates earned on loans 
economist paul getman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
forecasting firm said sampls have been unable to raise deposit rates 
because there is a fierce rate war going on in mortgage lending 
thrifts are pricing adjustable rate mortgages at near suicidal 
levels if they start raising deposit rates theyre going to have 
to raise mortgage rates and risk losing business theres no 
easy way out he said 
barth attributed another portion of the withdrawals to a 
deliberate strategy by regulators to shrink ailing institutions 
however he also acknowledged that some of the outflows were caused 
by confidence problems as publicity mounted about the condition of 
the industry 
in february for instance 13 billion of the withdrawals 
occurred at the 230 institutions targeted for immediate government 
takeover under president bushs plan for resolving the sampl crisis 
he said 
in the weeks preceding announcement of the bush plan on feb 6 
news accounts focused on an administration trial balloon suggesting 
that depositors would be asked to pay a fee to help bail out the sampl 
deposit insurance fund 
that sort of talk undoubtedly induced some people to believe 
why keep deposits at thrifts barth said 
february marks the 10th consecutive month of outflows from sampls 
and the fourth month in a row of outflows in excess of 7 billion 
they totaled 83 billion in december and 70 billion in november 
from may through october outflows totaled 94 billion 
that was offset by 162 billion in inflows during the first four 
months of 1988 when investors pulled their money out of the volatile 
stock market and put it into federally insured institutions 
through most of last year they lost deposits and theyre 
going to lose deposits all through this year thats not a sign of 
confidence as far as im concerned getman said

schools across the country are banning apples 
from lunchrooms even as one health expert mocks educators fears of 
the farm chemical alar as a toxic bogeyman 
on tuesday school systems in chicago minneapolisst paul and 
in virginia joined districts in new york city los angeles san 
francisco sacramento cincinnati atlanta and elsewhere in 
suspending sales of apples applesauce and apple juice the bans 
follow a report that children faced increased cancer risks from the 
chemical thats used to make some apples crisper and brighter 
seeking to slow the spread of apple bans and soothe consumer 
alarm californias top health officer said educators were acting 
hastily 
kenneth kizer director of the state department of health 
services pulled out a shiny red apple and took a bite as he 
explained that current research on alar a trade name for the 
compound daminozide shouldnt prompt anybody to quit eating the 
fruit 
in a nutshell i and the department of health services think 
this was reactionary and premature and indeed our fear is they have 
really created a toxic bogeyman kizer said 
the bans were prompted by a report last month from the 
washington dcbased natural resources defense council which 
estimated that the average preschoolers cancer risk was about one 
case for every 4000 preschoolers exposed to udmh a breakdown 
product of alar it found the risk greatest for children because of 
the large amounts of apple products they consume 
farm groups maintain little threat from the chemical exists and 
the manufacturer uniroyal chemical co of middlebury conn 
estimates it is used on only 5 percent of the nations apple crop 
the federal environmental protection agency plans to ban the use of 
alar on food crops in 18 months pending further study 
public lobbying against alar by actress meryl streep and a 
broadcast on the cbstv program 60 minutes have fueled the 
growing concern 
kizer said the risk of getting cancer from agricultural chemicals 
is dwarfed by the cancer threat posed by a bad diet overloaded with 
sugar and fat 
this should not change what parents are putting in their kids 
lunch or what schools are serving the kids kizer said of the 
controversy when we send a message to our kids that apples arent 
safe what are they going to eat theyre going to eat twinkies and 
zingers 
vicky scharlau a spokeswoman for the washington state apple 
commission which represents the nations largest apple crop said 
it was frustrating that school districts were choosing to disregard 
epa assurances that apples are safe 
they are taking the issue into their own hands and playing 
judge and jury she said they are instilling fear in children 
whose favorite products are apples and apple products 
chicago officials said the ban was temporary pending suppliers 
assurances that the products were free of alar 
in virginia bans were announced by school officials in fairfax 
county outside washington dc and in richmond 
the federal governments school lunch program will continue 
providing apples applesauce and apple slices to students said gene 
vincent a spokesman for the us department of agriculture 
our apples are certified alarfree vincent said 
a cyanide scare involving chilean fruit may divert consumer 
attention away from apples but wont solve the industrys problems 
said derl derr president of the international apple institute in 
mclean va 
washington state provides about twothirds of the nations 
supermarket apples this time of year and the states 5000 growers 
produce more than 310 million worth of apples per year 
ron myers a wenatchee wash apple grower and member of the 
washington apple commission said the growerfinanced commission 
planned to decide at its annual meeting today whether to spend part 
of a 16 million emergency fund on advertising to reassure 
consumers that apples are safe 
tree top inc the worlds largest apple juice processor also 
plans an advertising campaign in seattle san francisco los angeles 
and in usa today this week said spokesman john mcalister 
daminozide is used most commonly on apples but also on other 
fruit and on flowers it prevents apples from dropping or being 
blown from trees before they ripen brings out the color in some 
varieties and has other benefits 
varieties most commonly treated are macintosh red delicious 
golden delicious and jonathan granny smith pippin and other green 
apples generally arent treated

mexican authorities are turning away truckloads 
of live hogs from north of the border because they have not been 
vaccinated for hog cholera which has been eradicated from this 
country for more than a decade officials say 
calling the action an artificial trade barrier sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas is asking us trade representative carla hills and 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter to negotiate a halt 
a spokeswoman for hills says the office is looking into the 
situation after being contacted tuesday by bentsen bentsens office 
said mexico began turning away the us hogs on friday 
pat elhinnaway a spokeswoman for the agriculture departments 
animal and plant health inspection service said tuesday the agency 
just received official notification from mexico about the ban we 
are in the process of translating it and analyzing it elhinnaway 
said 
bentsen said mexico is barring the hog imports because the 
animals have not been vaccinated for hog cholera which has long 
been eradicated from the united states 
in fact it is illegal under us law to vaccinate hogs against 
hog cholera and since the hogs in question are market hogs destined 
for slaughter such a vaccination would be moot in any case said 
bentsen 
richard pasco director of legislative and regulatory affairs for 
the national pork producers council said he believes that a 
solution can be worked out 
our hogs do not have hog cholera pasco said it seems 
pretty obvious we have a reasonable argument here im not real 
pessimistic right now 
in the meantime he said its a real physical problem with 
truckers carrying live hogs looking for new markets or debating 
whether to wait it out and hoping they can soon take their loads 
into mexico which last year imported 83000 hogs 
bentsens office said the three most common ports of entry into 
mexico from texas for hogs are del rio laredo and eagle pass 
the us department of agriculture said mexico imported 115 
million in live market and breeder hogs in 1988 with most of the 
imports occuring in the last seven months of the year before last 
june mexico had a prohibitive 10 percent tariff on hog imports 
bentsens office said 
in 1987 under the 10 percent tariff mexico imported only 
650000 in us hogs this years imports were expected to exceed 
115 million if they had continued at the current rate bentsens 
office said 
the national pork producers council said mexico imported 95 
million in live hogs from the united states last year excluding 
breeders bentsens office said

the bush administration is finetuning its

confusion between the white house and state department over how much 
to request from congress 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday that 
reports president bush is preparing to ask congress to approve aid 
in the 40 million to 50 million range are in the ballpark 
but secretary of state james a baker iii told a congressional 
subcommittee that was not an accurate number as far as im 
concerned testifying before before the house appropriations 
foreign operations subcommittee baker didnt say whether the figure 
was too high or too low 
told about the discrepancy fitzwater said he agreed with baker 
and that when he talked about ballpark figures its a big 
ballpark 
meanwhile sen jesse helms rnc one of capitol hills most 
ardent contra supporters will introduce legislation this week to 
give the contras 75 million in new humanitarian aid when the 
current aid package runs out march 31 according to a congressional 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the helms plan would allow for purchase of such items as 
gasoline which are banned under the current aid setup because they 
could have a potentially military use 
helms also will seek a senseofthe congress resolution that 
resumption of military aid for the contras should be considered 
after one year unless president bush determines nicaragua has lived 
up to its promises to implement democratic reforms the source said 
bush administration officials have said they are not seeking 
miliitary aid and fitzwater reiterated tuesday that the goal is a 
diplomatic solution to the eightyearold internal war in nicaragua 
fitzwater said no final decision has been made on what will bush 
will propose in the way of new humanitarian aid and we are not 
setting artificial timetables for decisions 
contra leader adolfo calero said administration officials told 
him bush would seek in the neighborhood of 40 million to keep the 
contras alive in their camps on the honduran side of the nicaragua 
border where some 11000 rebels are encamped 
us sources have said the request probably will exceed 50 
million 
fitzwater said bushs plan would include the ideas of 
incentives and disincentives to accompany the humanitarian aid and 
diplomacy efforts 
in this approach we are also pursuing the building of a 
bipartisan support for whatever policy emerges he said 
administration officials have said baker is considering various 
economic and diplomatic incentives toward nicaragua if the ruling 
sandinistas live up to their promises for democratic reform 
fitzwater also acknowledged that the cooperation of honduras in 
allowing the contras to keep their camps on the border is a key 
factor 
he noted that undersecretary of state robert kimmitt visited 
honduran president jose azcona on monday and discussed with him the 
matter of incentives sandinista compliance with democratization 
pledges and the agreement by the five central american nations to 
reach agreement on disbanding the contras 
baker said the effort to maintain the antisandinista contras 
afloat represents a genuine view that they do represent somewhat 
of an incentive for the sandinista government to keep the promises 
they havent kept in the past including steps toward 
democratization and civil liberties 
the five central american presidents agreed last month in el 
salvador to devise a plan by this spring for the disbanding of the 
rebels in exchange for democratic reforms in nicaragua

attorney general dick thornburgh is giving the 
justice department 60 more days to determine whether a special 
prosecutor is needed to investigate payroll padding allegations 
against house member walter fauntroy 
the move by thornburgh gives his department more time to assess 
allegations against fauntroy and buys time to deal with a ticklish 
political question posed by the independent counsel order issued 
last summer by thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
on tuesday thornburgh amended the order that was issued as 
meeses last official act on his last day in office 
meese who himself was twice investigated by courtappointed 
independent counsels issued a regulation expanding the reach of the 
independent counsel statute from members of the executive branch to 
members of congress 
thornburgh gave himself the option of extending for another 60 
days the 90day preliminary inquiry provided in meeses order for 
determining if evidence warranted appointment of an independent 
counsel 
justice department spokesman david runkel said thornburgh issued 
the order to give the justice departments public integrity section 
more time to complete the inquiry into fauntroy a democrat who is 
the district of columbias nonvoting delegate 
the department has been investigating allegations that fauntroy 
hired the son of rep gus savage dill and paid him 21398 even 
though the younger savage was living in chicago instead of 
washington 
savage was on fauntroys payroll between september 1987 and june 
1988 a period during which he swore he was living in chicago 
because he was running for the illinois legislature 
the department opened its 90day inquiry after a report by the 
associated press about the employment arrangement 
after taking office thornburgh expressed doubts about the meese 
order thornburgh said that the public integrity section created 
when he was head of the criminal division in the mid1970s was 
capable of investigating corruption allegations against members of 
congress 
thornburgh however faced a storm of criticism from meese 
loyalists and conservative republicans in the house who are anxious 
to use the special prosecutor issue to embarrass house speaker jim 
wright dtexas the subject of an internal ethics probe 
the law has been criticized notably by people who have been 
prosecuted under it as unfairly applying only to executive branch 
officials and not members of congress 
after threatening to rescind the order thornburgh said he would 
study the issue since then the issue has been reviewed at the 
white house and in the justice department 
the attorney general recently asked the presidents commission on 
federal ethics law reform to study the issue the panel which 
issued its recommendations last week said members of congress 
should be subject to the independent counsel provisions as well as 
executive branch officials 
had thornburgh wished the fauntroy case would have provided the 
attorney general with a perfect opportunity to scuttle meeses 
order according to justice department sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
assistant attoney general edward sg dennis jr and other 
officials have voiced objections to the regulation which bars the 
department from subpoenaing documents or testimony during the 
preliminary investigation sources said 
the sources say there is uneasiness with the meese regulation 
because it could hobble a criminal investigation of a member of 
congress 
after the preliminary inquiry is completed according to the 
regulation the attorney general has the choice of closing the 
investigation or appointing an independent counsel to purse a 
fullscale criminal probe 
the independent counsel would be empowered to impanel a grand 
jury 
given this administrations recognition and the attorney 
generals recognition that the appearance of fairness and of ethical 
conduct is important i would have hoped that the attorney general 
would have been more careful to avoid the appearance of an 
eleventhhour change in the rules of the game said laurence 
tribe a harvard university law professor who is an avid defender of 
the independent counsel law

a renewed effort in congress to curb violence 
on television drew immediate challenges from broadcasters and from a 
civil rights organization that said the move was a trojan horse 
that could open the gates for government censorship of tv 
sen paul simon dill and rep dan glickman dkan saying 
there was overwhelming evidence of a link between excessive tv 
violence and childrens behavior introduced a bill tuesday that 
would grant a threeyear antitrust exemption to the tv industry so 
networks local stations the cable industry and producers could 
formulate voluntary guidelines on tv violence 
the bill is identical to a measure that simon and glickman 
offered unsuccessfully last year 
the national association of broadcasters and the american civil 
liberties union said the bill raised serious first amendment 
concerns 
aclu legislative counsel barry lynn labeled the bill a trojan 
horse to bring the government into the business of regulating the 
content of television broadcasting and cable 
there is nothing voluntary about guidelines which emerge from a 
regulated industry after congress has instructed it about specific 
programming it finds objectionable he said 
nab spokeswoman susan kraus said can it ever be truly 
voluntary when you have the government breathing down your neck 
she said that although the government can insulate the industry 
from antitrust actions it cannot insulate us from being sued on 
first amendment grounds 
she cited an attempt during the 1970s to institute a family 
viewing hour on television between 8 pm and 9 pm the industry 
was sued by the directors guild of america on first amendment 
grounds and the family hour was abandoned 
simon said he did not intend to censor television or circumvent 
first amendment protections for free speech 
the legislation does not permit or contemplate the 
establishment of a private national censorship board or enforcement 
authority he said and it presents no such threat to freedom of 
speech or artistic expression 
but he said its time for the television industry to forge a 
partnership with americas families to scale back the atmosphere of 
violence that is erupting in our communities on our main streets 
even in our schoolyards 
he said that while a onetoone link had not been established 
between tv violence and violent behavior in america study after 
study has shown a connection between television violence and 
negative and aggresssive behavior 
the evidence that televised violence contributes to aggressive 
and destructive behavior is now nothing short of overwhelming he 
said 
he pointed to resolutions on the subject passed by the american 
psychological association the american psychiatric association and 
the american medical association 
last years bill like another one in 1986 passed the senate but 
died in the house however simon said he felt the bills chances 
were better this year his office said the bill had 34 cosponsors 
in the house and seven in the senate including sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio the chairman of the senate antitrust 
subcommittee and sen strom thurmond the panels ranking 
republican

house democrats hoping to boost the minimum 
wage to 465 an hour moved closer to a showdown with the white 
house by quickly rejecting president bushs call for a smaller 
increase coupled with a training wage 
the democratic majority of the house education and labor 
committee quashed bushs proposal and passed its minimumwage 
measure tuesday shortly after labor secretary elizabeth dole said 
bushs offer would be his last 
most definitely he has said this is it this is as far as i 
can go mrs dole said in threatening a presidential veto of the 
democrats proposal for the second time in a week 
undaunted the committees 22 democrats unanimously backed 
legislation that would bring the minimum wage from its current 335 
an hour to 465 an hour through three annual increases starting 
jan 1 1990 all 13 republican members voted against that plan 
the proposal that was sent to the full house does not contain a 
subminimum training wage bush has demanded the president in his 
measure advocated raising the minimum wage to 425 an hour by 1992 
provided employers are allowed to pay new hires 335 during their 
first six months on the job 
mrs dole first outlined specifics of the bush plan last week 
before the senate labor committee which nonetheless backed a bill 
that essentially mirrors the one passed tuesday by its house 
counterpart 
the administration proposal was submitted in writing for the 
first time tuesday when republicans on the house committee 
unsucessfully attempted to substitute it for the democratic version 
this is a compromise rep william f goodling of 
pennsylvania the committees ranking republican said in 
introducing bushs plan the president has gone way beyond 
anything im sure your side thought you could ever sell to my side 
that was a reference to unsuccessful democratic attempts to raise 
the minimum wage during the reagan admininstration still the 
democrats said bush has not come far enough in raising the minimum 
and has gone too far in seeking to establish a sixmonth training 
wage 
democrats in both chambers have indicated a willingness to 
compromise with bush on a training wage but have said such a 
provision must have a clear requirement for actual training and a 
shorter life than six months most democrats also want the training 
wage if included in the legislation to apply only to young people 
bush wants it to cover any worker hired by a company for the first 
time 
in exchange for some compromise on that issue the democrats 
expect bush to accept their proposal to lift the minimum to 465 
but mrs dole indicated such hopes might prove unfounded 
weve already compromised she said legislation outside 
these parameters would call for a veto 
democrats said they hoped for bushs sake that he was bluffing 
with one rep austin murphy dpa saying he hoped a compromise 
acceptable to all could be reached so that democrats would not have 
to embarrass bush presumably by overriding a veto 
committee chairman augustus f hawkins dcalif said he 
expected the full house to pass the measure next week senate 
passage is expected to come soon as well after which a conference 
committee would be named to iron out any differences 
mrs dole said the labor department projects 650000 jobs would 
be lost if the democratic version of the legislation is enacted as 
it now stands while 200000 jobs would be lost under the bush 
proposal which also would expand exemptions allowing some small 
businesses to pay less than the minimum wage 
the democratic majority however disputed those figures 
the track record hasnt proven that to be true and i dont 
think it will in this instance either said rep charles a hayes 
dill 
the democrats complained that opposition from reagan to any 
increase in the minimum wage has left it frozen at 335 for eight 
years 
if adjusted for inflation over that period the minimum would now 
be 457 an hour and by 1992 would be 524 an hour 59 cents higher 
than called for in the bills sponsored by hawkins in the house and 
sen edward m kennedy dmass in the senate

honduras and nicaragua are at odds 
over whether the bush administrations expected proposal for more 
aid to nicaraguan rebels violates a central american agreement to 
dismantle contra rebel forces 
a honduran presidential spokesman on tuesday said such a request 
would not not contradict the feb 14 accords which call for the 
dissolution of the nicaraguan rebels 
the accord reached in el salvador does not rule out 
humanitarian help before the dismantling said marco tulio romero 
spokesman for honduran president jose azcona hoyo 
but barricada the newspaper of nicaraguas ruling sandinista 
party on tuesday maintained the aid plans trample on central 
american peace efforts 
the united states cannot continue indefinitely with the double 
standard of speaking in favor of peace when the only thing it wants 
is to make war the newspaper said 
the neighboring countries were reacting to reports the bush 
administration will ask congress for an extension of nonlethal aid 
to the contras 
washington has helped the contras since 1981 in their fight 
against the leftist sandinistas a campaign all but halted one year 
ago after us military aid to the rebels ceased and a truce was 
signed by the warring parties 
azcona and four other central american presidents agreed to draft 
a plan by may 15 to demobilize the contras about 11000 of whom 
live in jungle camps in honduras near the nicaraguan border 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua promised in turn electoral 
and other reforms to bring greater democracy to his country ortega 
moved up general elections by 10 months to february 1990 
in keeping with that agreement nicaraguas national assembly on 
tuesday it would grant amnesty to 1933 former national guardsmen 
most of them jailed since the triumph of the sandinista revolution 
in july 1979 
barricada said the announcment that bush will ask congress for 
more humanitarian aid to maintain the contras in honduran territory 
for a year to pressure nicaragua clashes with the task of 
demobilization and tramples the central american accord 
the progovernment nicaragua daily el nuevo diario said the 
request would be a blow to the peace agreements 
government sources in washington and contra leaders have told the 
associated press the 12month aid request is 40 million to 50 
million 
a 27 million sixmonth package of nonlethal aid approved by 
congress last year runs out at the end of march 
they the bush administration want something thatll see us 
through well into the nicaraguan election us embassy spokesman 
charles barclay said in tegucigalpa 
it is in honduras interests that these armed insurgent groups 
dont remain orphans without humanitarian aid from the united 
states foreign minister carlos lopez contreras told a news 
conference 
honduran officials met in this capital monday with the us 
undersecretary of state for political affairs robert m kimmitt 
the purpose of his visit was to politically coordinate the 
strengthening of central american democracy said lopez contreras 
the united states and our government dont want armed groups to 
remain permanently in honduran territory but we also support the 
democratization of nicaragua

the finding that some strains of aids virus are 
resistant to treatment by the most widely used antiaids drug will 
not require any immediate change in use of the drug researchers 
said 
a study by the drugs maker found that 11 patients with advanced 
aids or aidsrelated complex a related illness were infected with 
virus strains only partly responsive to treatment with the antiaids 
drug azt 
five patients carried virus strains with very marked reductions 
in sensitivity to the drug according to a letter sent to doctors 
by the the the manufacturer burroughs wellcome co of research 
triangle park nc 
azt also known as zidovudine or retrovir is the only drug 
approved in the united states to treat aids virus infection 
people who are on azt and are currently benefiting from azt 
should not panic and consider this a major setback said dr 
anthony fauci director of the aids program at the national 
institutes of health 
just because one can isolate a resistant strain from a patient 
doesnt mean azt is not effective in combating most of the viral 
replication in the patient 
preliminary results of the study were announced tuesday in 
london a full report of the study by brendan larder and graham 
darby of wellcome research laboratories in england and douglas 
richman of the university of california san diego will be 
published soon in the journal science 
the development of resistant strains of infectious agents after 
widespread use of a drug is common doctors said many bacteria for 
example have become resistant to penicillin and therefore must be 
treated with other antibiotics 
the same thing happened with genital herpes virus after the 
introduction of a drug to treat it said dr sandra nusinoff 
lehrman head of the department of antimicrobial therapy at 
burroughs wellcome 
in that case the viruses that became resistant to the drug also 
became less able to cause disease she said 
i would say these findings dont in themselves require that any 
alterations in patient therapy be made said lehrman 
however the thing you have to stress is that decisions about 
the treatment of hiv the aids virus really are joint decisions 
between a particular physician and his patient 
fauci said two new antiaids drugs are beginning human trials 
now and the use of those drugs in combination with azt should 
enable doctors to control any aztresistant strains of the human 
immune deficiency virus that causes aids 
you have other drugs that are also effective against the aids 
virus fauci said you either switch or use a combination of 
drugs 
the two new drugs dideoxycytidine or ddc and dideoxyinosine 
or ddi are available at national institutes of health aids 
treatment centers across the country for patients whose infection 
might become severely resistant to azt he said 
eventually those drugs might be used in combination with azt or 
each other to treat resistant strains he said

st patrick set down your shilelagh and 
put up your dukes here comes that great grasshopperdriving saint 
urho the finn and his day is first 
st urho its a little known fact that he drove the 
grasshoppers out of preglacial finland it just happens he did it 
the day before st patrick supposedly drove the snakes out of 
ireland said tom tikkanen a finlander in calumet 
with tikkanens guidance the tiny town on michigans lake 
superior shore held its first official st urho celebration this 
year the oulu hotshots brought their accordions up from wisconsin 
last weekend and vi wiitala drove over from toivola calumet partied 
st urhos day isnt until thursday but the locals dont muddle 
legend with fact 
tikkanen said this years bash started after some calumet folks 
trolling lake superior with their snowmobiles snagged an old sauna 
off the bottom and in it was the frozen body of the great saint 
himself 
we fired that sauna up and thawed him out tikkanen said 
the irish dont hold a corner on blarney 
the fact is urho is fiction from minnesota 
the legend of the legend is that in virginia minn a finnish 
department store employee named richard mattson grew tired of the 
todo over st patrick in 1956 he made up a st urho who drove out 
frogs to save finlands vineyards said dr marsha penti an 
archivist at suomi college in hancock mich 
the same year another finn sulo havumak of bemidji minn 
created a st urho who pursued grasshoppers with a pitchfork 
havumak had the first st urho party and it is his version that has 
become legend penti said 
ever since then the men and women have gone out and hopped 
around like frogs or grasshoppers penti said 
well maybe not 
urho spread like fire among the finnish communities in the united 
states governors of all 50 states have signed st urhos day 
proclamations the saints curlytoed boots have shown up in parties 
and street celebrations from fitchburg mass to the moose lodge in 
apache junction ariz 
menahga minn has a chain saw carved wood statue of urho 
holding an impaled grasshopper on his pitchfork and saying 
heinasirkka heinasirkka mene taalta hiiteem that means 
grasshopper grasshopper go to the devil penti said 
a museum in minnesota claims urhos grave now calumet has his 
sauna and penti heard someone someplace dyed their dog st urhos 
colors purple and green 
nowhere is urho better loved than in michigans upper peninsula 
which boasts the nations greatest concentration of finlanders and 
where finnish is spoken by oldtimers on the streets 
even folks like 70yearold les lark who isnt finnish decided 
to partake in the 1970s lark celebrated st urho at his escanaba 
tvern 
the local irish didnt mind until the day lark festooned betty 
murphys pub in gladstone with a st urho is no 1 banner lark 
asked all the cbowning residents of delta county to drive by and 
toot their horn at betty 
betty murphy the next year marched on larks with irish banners 
and squirt guns filled with green food dye the finns of escanaba 
remembered st urho that day with great green battle scars

a proposal for more upfront payments to close 
insolvent savings and loans is gaining support among some democrats 
as an alternative to president bushs bailout plan for the industry 
the general accounting office was asked tuesday by sen don 
riegle chairman of the senate banking committee to work up 
estimates on the impact of absorbing most of the bailout costs 
immediately rather than spreading them over 30 years as bush would 
do 
we may find ourselves a way to save an awfully lot of money 
riegle said after congressional auditors testified it would have 
been cheaper to close and pay off depositors in 179 failed sampls in 
1988 that instead were merged and kept open through government 
subsidies 
comptroller general charles a bowsher said he could not estimate 
how much cheaper outright closings would have been but because many 
of the mergers arranged by the federal home loan bank board carry 
10year aid packages that include tax breaks and guarantees against 
losses for the new owners he estimated the mergers plus expenses in 
closing 43 other sampls last year will total more than 62 billion 
over a decade 
bush would pay for closing or merging another 350 sampls at or near 
insolvency through 50 billion to be raised over the next three 
years from the sale of taxpayerguaranteed bonds by a new offbudget 
government corporation 
the bonds would not be paid off for 30 years and only the annual 
interest costs associated with them would be reflected in the 
federal budget but those interest costs would be 100 million to 
200 million more annually or 3 billion to 6 billion more over 
30 years than if the tab for the bailout were simply lumped into 
the federal debt 
riegle said dumping as much of the bailout costs as possible into 
the fiscal 1989 budget would be a cleaner approach without 
upsetting a resolve by congress and bush to meet a 100 billion 
deficit target in the fiscal 1990 budget 
both have given up hopes of meeting the 136 billion deficit 
target set in the 1985 grammrudman deficit reduction law for fiscal 
1989 which ends sept 30 the white house now says the 1989 deficit 
will be more like 170 billion 
this may be another way to work with the grammrudman 
restraints and at the same time save the taxpayers an awfully lot of 
money riegle said then we wouldnt be forced to make these 
mergers which are very expensive 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee has endorsed a similar approach to riegles plan as has 
william niskanean a former economic adviser to president reagan 
according to riegles plan the government would buy back many of 
the notes and loans it sold at discounts to the new owners of the 
institutions it merged in 1988 before sept 30 
the plan also would include in the 1989 budget the cost of 
closing and paying off depositors in the worst of the 350 insolvent 
but stilloperating sampls 
the federal deposit insurance corp has taken control of over 120 
of those institutions in the two months since bush announced his sampl 
proposal and plans to take control of another 100 before the end of 
march 
however without the needed money in the government insurance 
funds to pay off their depositors or subsidize their mergers those 
sampls are still operating with losses mounting in the tens of 
millions of dollars daily 
the gao estimated the cost of the 1988 sampl closings and mergers 
at 37 billion assuming all could be paid for immediately rather 
than financed and not including the 6 billion to 8 billion in tax 
breaks that were a part of some packages 
both administration and congressional experts put the 
presentvalue cost of resolving the other 350 insolvent institutions 
at roughly 50 billion that makes the total cost of the bailout 
package about 90 billion if it all could be paid for in cash 
instead of borrowing 
i dont think people realize the magnitude of the problem 
bowsher said 
this is bigger than the marshall plan he said referring to 
the 13 billion 60 billion in todays dollars that the united 
states spent rebuilding europe after world war ii 
bowsher said the cost to the government of just one sampl merger 
package alone in december was greater than the combined costs of the 
governments bailouts of new york city the lockheed corp and the 
chrysler corp in the 1970s

the nations major jobtraining program puts 
too much emphasis on getting people jobs quickly and too little on 
giving them real skills a study panel concluded in suggesting the 
recessionspawned program has fallen out of step with todays 
revived economy 
the panel on tuesday suggested nearly 30 changes in the job 
training partnership act and its programs most notably major 
revisions in how jtpa money is targeted adoption of longterm 
funding commitments and increased spending to help youths find 
meaningful work 
the 38member job training partnership act advisory committee 
presented its report tuesday to labor secretary elizabeth dole 
earlier tuesday she told congress the bush administration soon 
would recommend amending the program created in 1982 with 
legislation sponsored by vice president quayle then an indiana 
senator and massachusetts sen edward m kennedy 
the study group was formed in july 1988 and consists of corporate 
executives and various school and elected officials 
the authors without referring directly to the jtpa sponors said 
they should not be blamed for program deficiencies that the report 
said encouraged quick job placements over careertrack training 
that vision understandably was distracted by a severe recession 
and federal encouragement to use all available resources to get 
people back to work the report said therefore early emphasis 
on placements became the routine business of jtpa 
the authors said any improvements in the program hinged on a 
longterm funding commitment 
throughout the jtpa system longrange planning has been 
rendered virtually impossible by the shortterm yeartoyear 
orientation of the program formula funding volatility and numerous 
constraints currently embodied in the legislation the report 
said the adoption of a longerterm perspective must become a 
priority 
mrs dole in her testimony said she would review the report and 
gave no hints of what changes the administration would propose 
although she has talked vaguely in the past of better targeting of 
jtpa funds a major goal of the 38member study panel 
the report recommended a major revision of the formula used to 
allocate jtpa money so that a majority of funding goes to train 
economically disadvantaged people who either have serious skills 
deficiencies or are welfare dependent 
the current formula distributes twothirds of jtpa funds for 
adults on the basis of an areas unemployment rate regardless of 
whether those unemployed people have serious skills shortages the 
report said 
at the same time the panel warned that shortsighted performance 
objectives stressing cost and job placements in some cases have 
encouraged quickfix approaches that provide enrollees with too 
little training but place them rapidly in jobs 
in those cases job placements often are short term and the worker 
is returned to the ranks of the unemployed without the necessary 
skills to find a career position the report said 
the suggested changes the report said should end the principal 
criticism of jtpa that it engages in creaming or placing in 
training programs those it considers most ready for employment 
instead of helping those most in need of training 
it also said training programs for youths should separated from 
adult programs and bolstered with an additional 500 million with 
most of that money spent on dropouts and other unskilled youths no 
longer in school 
it also suggested restructuring youthtraining programs with a 
yearround focus instead of separate school year and summer programs

to that conclusion and he will not seek a third term as speaker if 
the findings undermine his support 
if i were convinced in my mind that most of my colleagues 
didnt want me to be speaker i wouldnt run for speaker id serve 
out my term as effectively as i can wright dtexas said during 
an impromptu luncheon with a group of reporters 
in another interview later in the day he added this is not 
the driving ambition of my life to succeed myself as speaker 
but he said his democratic colleagues had given him no reason to 
believe he will have to take that step and added im not 
contemplating not seeking a third term 
the texas democrat seemed to blame some of his ethics problems on 
lack of attention to his own finances saying he had been 
preoccupied throughout his long congressional career with being an 
effective lawmaker 
if the committee should say well jim back there before he 
was speaker should have done a particular thing or whatever we 
think this is bad judgment well ill accept that wright said 
i have confidence in them im not going to quarrel with that 
i probably have done things which in hindsight were poor judgment 
but werent dishonest wouldnt be a violation of the rules but 
they might be bad judgment 
asked what his attorney william oldaker had relayed to him from 
the closed sessions of the ethics committee oldaker has attended 
wright said i hear very confident expressions that the committee 
cannot find that i have violated a rule and surely havent violated 
a basic standard of honesty at all 
at another point he said im at peace with myself 
but wright also has evidenced nervousness about the ethics probe 
sending a mass mailing to his fort worth district last month 
portraying himself as the victim of partisan politics and touting 
the federal largesse he has brought home for his constituents 
the house committee on standards of official conduct known as 
the ethics committee was resuming its closeddoor deliberations 
today after hearing closing arguments on tuesday from the speakers 
lawyer william oldaker and from the committees special outside 
counsel richard phelan 
it appeared that the panel would spend at least the rest of this 
week deliberating the six charges against wright which include 
allegations of misuse of his office for personal financial gain 
improper lobbying of federal officials and receiving free use of a 
fort worth condominium 
sources declining to be identified by name have said the panel 
is focusing heavily on wrights dealings with george mallick a fort 
worth friend and business partner a final decision on whether to 
seek sanctions against the speaker on any of the counts could come 
next week 
wright acknowledged that an effort was under way by democratic 
colleagues to mount a public defense for him led by majority leader 
tom foley dwash and including reps martin frost dtexas steny 
hoyer dmd barney frank dmass and david nagle diowa 
if the republicans want to create a scene a divisive issue 
our people will answer he said

nearly 55 million in forest service money that 
the reagan administration diverted from a land acquisition fund has 
been restored making it possible to add thousands of acres to 
national forests in 22 states 
the forest service had been told in the final months of the 
reagan administration to move the 549 million into its 
firefighting fund in anticipation of forest fires in 1989 john 
leasure budget officer for the forest service said tuesday 
he said the fire season has just begun and it is too early to 
tell how much will be needed but about 40 million is available and 
more could be obtained later if needed 
the land being added to existing national forests is considered 
necessary to protect forests from encroachment by developers or 
other private interests 
the largest expenditures and the forests involved are 804 
million for nantahala national forest nc 74 million lake 
tahoe basin calif 57 million columbia river gorge ore 49 
million green mountain national forest vt and 36 million 
eleven point wild and scenic river mo 
sen patrick leahy dvt and chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee along with others in congress had objected to the office 
of management and budget when the reagan administration proposed to 
spend land acquisition funds on firefighting 
i am pleased that budget director richard darman has seen to 
it that president bushs expressed commitment to the environment has 
been honored said leahy i am glad that our lastditch efforts 
paid off and that the omb reversed its earlier position

torrential rains in australias outback 
turned dry creeks into 12milewide rivers and marooned remote 
homesteads in the regions worst flooding in at least a 
halfcentury officials said 
no casualties were reported monday and tuesday in what the daily 
newspaper sydney morning herald today said was believed to be one of 
the heaviest rainfalls since australia was settled by europeans in 
1788 
australian weather records however have only been kept since 
1924 
the meteorogical agency said parts of the parched continent had 
experienced the first rain in years 
in the state of south australia nearly 11 inches of rain fell in 
24 hours the normally dry wilpena creek became a 12milewide river 
while the opal mining town of andamooka in western australia state 
was kneedeep in water 
residents at broken hill in far western new south wales said 
reservoirs were almost overflowing after a years supply of rain 
fell in just two days they said it was the worst flooding since 
1932 
broken hill water board spokesman noel wood said residents had 
been forced to cope with severe water restrictions last week now 
he said the towns reservoirs are at their highest level since 1974 
the rains deluged three of the continents six states from 
western and central australia to the eastern seaboard causing 
millions of dollars in damage and loss of livestock to isolated 
rural farms 
in canberra the federal capital police warned children to stay 
away from swirling stormwater drains throughout the city where 
flooding closed several roads 
many outback farms were flooded out and news reports headlined

a windy first day on the job may have brought a 
quick end to the career of a highrise window washer who froze with 
fear and clung to a pillar on the sixth floor before being rescued 
ray trevino had lowered himself from the roof of the 22story 
marriott hotel at texas medical center on monday but lost his 
confidence when gusts blew him around in his chair 
it just got too windy trevino said its really scary 
being way up there when its windy and youre just hanging onto a 
rope 
trevino held onto the edge of the building for about 45 minutes 
before he was rescued by firefighter randy fisher who reached him 
by using a 100foot ladder 
i said ray im as scared as you are now so lets just take 
this thing slow one step at a time fisher said he didnt say 
a whole lot of anything

the worlds biggest iceberg 
believed to be about the size of hong kong is slowly melting in 
antarctica and appears to pose no threat to shipping a news agency 
reported today 
the iceberg which has been codenamed b9 is the longest ever 
accurately recorded and has travelled a 620mile circle since it 
broke away from the ross ice shelf 18 months ago the new zealand 
press association said 
the agency said scientists had been worried it might block the 
entrance to the us research base at mcmurdo sound where 700 
people live during the southern hemisphere summer 
the iceberg is now about 250 miles east of ross island and 185 
miles from where it broke from the shelf glaciologist harry keys 
told the news agency 
when it first cracked off the shelf it was 95 miles long 22 
miles wide and 1155 feet thick dimensions that almost correspond 
with the size of the british colony of hong kong nzpa said 
it said the the giant chunk of ice has since lost six miles of 
its length the agency gave no other details and keys could not be 
reached for independent comment

the last 30 minutes of trading 
despite concerns that today was the account settlement day for 
futures markets in which the nikkeis 225 spot issues are often 
sold for profittaking the index rose mainly due to stability in 
the bond and foreign exchange markets

the us commerce department was to announce us trade figures 
for january later today and tokyo dealers said they expect the 
figure to narrow to about 10 billion down from decembers 1189 
billion 
construction issues were among the winners in active trading 
with the firstsection volume estimated at 12 billion shares 
in currency dealings the dollaryen rate moved little in

the first attempt to crystallize a virus in 
space is taking place aboard discovery as scientists use 
weightlessness to try to design better crops and new drugs against 
cancer aids emphysema and other diseases 
from the crystals we will be able to learn the structure of 
the virus said biochemist alexander mcpherson of the university of 
california riverside 
if we know the crystal structures of viruses we may be able to 
design vaccines to prevent infection or drugs to lessen the effects 
of infection by binding to targets on viruses that cause aids 
certain cancers hepatitis influenza and the common cold he added 
the virus in mcphersons shuttleborne experiment is a harmless 
one named stmv or satellite tobacco mosaic virus it is a parasite 
virus that can replicate itself only when attached to tmv or 
tobacco mosaic virus a disease that afflicts tobacco tomato 
pepper and certain other plants 
but stmv is the basic model for understanding the way viruses 
are put together said biochemist charles bugg of the university 
of alabama at birmingham 
understanding its structure in detail would allow us to 
understand all viruses better 
the stmv experiment mcpherson said is the first time weve 
tried to crystallize a virus in space 
stmv is among 15 substances mostly proteins inside discoverys 
60 crystallization chambers the experiments activated monday are 
aimed at determining whether the weightlessness of space will let 
scientists grow large perfect crystals of proteins viruses and 
other substances 
gravity makes it extremely difficult to grow perfect crystals on 
earth efforts to grow crystals on previous shuttle flights yielded 
mixed results although some were successful 
the overall crystallization project led by bugg could improve 
food production and lead to innovative new drugs to combat cancer 
aids high blood pressure organ transplant rejection rheumatoid 
arthritis and many other diseases the national aeronautics and 
space administration said 
scientists need perfect crystals of proteins viruses and other 
substances so they can bombard the crystals with xrays to learn 
their precise threedimensional structure the structure of a 
protein or virus determines what it does 
proteins control the functioning of all living things viruses 
consist of basic hereditary information surrounded by a protein 
shell researchers believe knowing the exact structure of a protein 
or virus will let them alter what it does or develop drugs to block 
what it does 
on discoverys flight last fall burroughs wellcome co grew 
crystals of reverse transcriptase a protein that lets the aids 
virus replicate in human cells if the crystals help scientists 
determine the proteins structure they might be able to devise a 
drug to hinder it and thus treat aids mcpherson said 
on this weeks flight biocryst ltd is trying to crystallize 
influenza neuraminidase a protein used by flu viruses to invade 
human cells the crystals might let researchers learn enough about 
the protein to create a drug to block its ability to trigger the 
flu bugg said 
discovery also carries an experiment in which mcpherson is 
growing crystals of canavalin the key protein in beans peas and 
other legumes humanitys thirdlargest source of food protein 
after meat and fish scientists hope to learn canavalins structure 
then alter it to make legumes even more nutritious mcpherson said 
university of pennsylvania and smithkline beckman corp 
scientists are trying to crystallize a protein that controls the 
expression of genes the basic units of heredity certain genes act 
as switches to turn on cancer bugg said learning how the protein 
works could aid development of anticancer drugs 
merck amp co again is trying to crystallize elastase an enzyme 
that degrades lung tissue in an effort to develop drugs to block 
degradation the lungs in emphysema 
an upjohn co experiment aboard discovery is an effort to 
crystallize human renin an enzyme that regulates blood pressure 
learning its structure could spur development of new drugs to 
control high blood pressure 
eli lilly co is crystallizing human growth hormone which now is 
used to spur growth in children with certain growth disorders bugg 
said knowing the hormones structure could lead to improved versions 
that might be used to speed healing of wounds and burns 
some scientists have criticized hoopla about crystallization 
experiments on the shuttle saying its a giant step from 
crystallizing a protein or virus to being able to develop a useful 
drug 
bugg agreed hype surrounds the experiments but only because 
their presence on the shuttle makes them subject to intense 
publicity long before researchers know if the promising experiments 
will produce valuable results

foreign airlines operating in the united states 
will have to have security programs approved by the federal aviation 
administration under a new rule adopted by the government 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner told the senate 
transportation appropriations subcommittee tuesday that the new 
requirement is aimed at making sure foreign carriers have adequate 
security measures to protect civil aviation against criminal acts of 
violence 
the rule was proposed by the government late last year before 
the dec 21 destruction of pan american flight 103 by a bomb over 
lockerbie scotland which resulted in 270 deaths 
american carriers already must have faaapproved security 
procedures 
under the new regulation the 111 foreign airlines serving the 
united states would have to submit their security procedures to the 
faa within 90 days of the rules official publication in the federal 
register that is expected thursday 
the faa is required to tell the carriers if their rules are 
adequate within 30 days of receiving them if they are judged 
insufficient the government could ultimately withdraw an airlines 
permission to land in this country

the federal government should step up action 
against companies that charge high rates without notice to people 
who make longdistance calls on public phones a tennessee 
congressman says 
rep jim cooper dtenn said federal communications commission 
action last month was too little too late in ordering five 
alternative operator service companies to clearly identify 
themselves make their rates available and not block calls to any 
longdistance carrier 
much more is needed to protect the consumer from such 
companies that now are handling 20 percent of the calls at the 
nations 75 million public phones cooper said tuesday 
even the major aos companies themselves have already agreed to 
a code of ethics that goes farther than the fcc action he said 
why is the fcc so timid when almost everyone agrees that major 
reforms are needed 
cooper who along with rep matthew j rinaldo rnj has 
introduced legislation requiring such companies to charge just and 
reasonable rates said these companies are carging as much as 200 
percent more than normal longdistance rates charging for 
incompleted calls billing from cities the caller has never visited 
and are channeling callers onto longdistance carriers they did not 
choose

statistics showing a higher estimated cost of 
major pentagon weapon programs have already been overtaken by 
events says a defense spokesman 
the latest selected acquisition report released tuesday showed 
that the estimated cost of the pentagons 94 biggest weapon programs 
skyrocketed by 575 billion last year primarily because the 
services want to buy more of certain weapons in the mid1990s 
however president bush told congress in february he would cut 
back the military buildup plans of former president reagan so the 
statistics are out of date said jim turner a pentagon spokesman 
the update is based on the budget and policy guidelines of the 
reagan administration because congress mandates the review be 
conducted every dec 31 turner said 
nonetheless the report outlines the priorities of the services 
and the budget items over which bush congress and the military are 
likely to clash 
as of dec 31 the pentagon said the 94 key programs that reagan 
was pursuing carried a combined pricetag of 8186 billion up 575 
billion or 76 percent from a quarterly estimate last sept 30

us grocers predicted longterm effects from government warnings 
not to eat grapes and other fruit from chile as they moved millions 
of dollars in produce from the south american country off store 
shelves and ito warehouses 
the food and drug administraiton in one of the largest actions 
of its kind warned consumers monday not to eat fruit imported from 
chile after cyanide was found in two seedless red grapes shipped to 
philadelphia 
boston wholesaler tom freni said tuesday he thinks its going 
to be the end of the season for chilean products 
youre not going to turn peoples minds around after what the 
fda said last night whos going to take a chance on buying the 
product said freni general manager of the jr freni co 
big supermarket chains and small grocers alike voluntarily pulled 
grapes plums peaches nectarines raspberries and other chilean 
produce off the shelves nationwide although most stores put the 
fruit in cold storage to await further instructions from the fda 
some destroyed it 
public confidence is extremely perishable destroy a persons 
confidence that they can enjoy a piece of wholesome fruit and you 
have effectively closed down the market said tom kovacevich 
chairman of the new york produce trade association at the hunts 
point produce market in new york city 
boston wholesaler paul tavilla predicted huge losses nationwide 
as frightened customers shied away from all fruit not just chilean 
produce 
i figure were losing 400 to 500 in fruit sales a day 
well probably have to eat it said tom calcagno manager of the 
youngs bay food pavilion in warrenton ore 
jack montgomery manager of montgomery produce in yuma ariz 
said wholesalers and retailers are hurt by such a scare but on a 
longterm basis even the local growers are hurt he said the 
warnings will make everyone scared of grapes 
a los angeles produce importer gobbled chilean grapes at a news 
conference tuesday to dramatize his claim that the fruit is safe and 
the government is ruining a booming industry unnecessarily 
i think its a major major overreaction rick eastes 
general manager of the david oppenheimer california importer said 
of the fda advisory an industry worth 750 million in the united 
states and canada has been brought to a standstill we have been 
assassinated by insinuation 
the fda said cyanide was confirmed in testing ordered at american 
ports after an anonymous threat to poison chilean fruit was 
telephoned to the us embassy in santiago chiles capital 
although federal officials said cyanide had only been found in 
two grapes fda commissioner frank young urged americans to be 
safe rather than sorry 
not all stores were heeding the warning the valuking food 
center in morgantown wva is leaving the decision up to customers 
if they want it the fruit fine if they dont want it let 
it sit on the shelves said employee anthony edward bell 
most store managers said customers who return produce will get 
refunds they said most inquiries had been from concerned people who 
had already eaten fruit the fda said consumers should not be 
worried about fruit already consumed because cyanide is fastacting 
emptied food bins were quickly filled with usgrown produce 
we may have more squash than usual out said john goodell real 
estate manager for dans a utahbased chain with seven stores 
virtually all the fresh grapes sold in the united states at this 
time of year come from chile fda officials said grapes make up 
about twothirds of the chilean fruit currently being shipped to the 
united states 
meredith auerbach director of marketing for california table 
grape commission said most of californias crop is marketed from 
may through january or february each year so there shouldnt be 
much on grocery shelves from california harvests now 
joey labarba a manager at dallasbased american food service 
said he personally wasnt worried about tainted fruit 
a shipment of raspberries came in today and when they got here 
i ate them myself labarba said

premier andreas papandreous top aide 
resigned from the cabinet over his alleged involvement in a banking 
scandal and a member of the governing party said the premier should 
follow suit 
agamemnon koutsogiorgas on tuesday became the eighth cabinet 
member to resign since the scandal surfaced in october 
having stood by you for 25 years in all democratic struggles 
i resign from my position as minister to the prime minister 
expressing my sensitivity the premiers aide said in a letter to 
papandreou 
papandreous government defeated a motion of censure by a 
parliamentary vote of 155123 monday night the motion was 
introduced by the opposition new democracy party which said members 
of papandreous socialist government were deeply involved in the 
scandal 
three legislators from papandreous panhellenic socialist 
movement abstained in the voting and the premier quickly expelled 
them from the party for not supporting the government 
one of the three antonis tritsis said tuesday the government 
should resign to save greeces honor 
he said if a caretaker government is not formed to prepare for 
the june 18 elections then papandreou puts a tragic end to his 
political life 
koutsogiorgas has repeatedly denied the claims by the 
conservative opposition that he was directly involved in the 
scandal which centers around greek banker george koskotas 
koskotas is in a salem mass jail awaiting a hearing on a greek 
extradition request he fled greece in november after being indicted 
in a 200 million fraud and embezzlement case 
he has said papandreou and cabinet members authorized plans to 
siphon millions of dollars from the bank of crete while koskotas was 
chairman and that they received millions of dollars in payoffs 
papandreou has denied the allegations and claimed koskotas was 
part of a cia scheme to destablize greeces socialist government 
the premier also threatened painful consequences if the 
united states does not return koskotas to greece before the 
elections he did not say what the consequences might be but hinted 
last week they could involve the future of us military bases in 
greece 
washington has denied the allegations about the cia and new 
democracy leader constantine mitsotakis called them a childrens

competition not aesthetics is the issue behind a 
state law defining schlock art said an art dealer as cheap art 
went on trial 
the reason for this is the rockport art association cant 
compete with my prices said united oil paintings inc president 
aaron abady who testified tuesday in the nonjury trial before 
superior court judge john cratsley 
the massachusetts law which attorneys said is the first of its 
kind in the nation was passed in july at the urging of artists and 
gallery owners in the seaside town of rockport 
it bans the sale of nonoriginal art works unless they are 
labeled not an original violators may be fined 100 per 
painting 
united oil paintings of milford which sells oil paintings for 
35 to 200 filed suit against the state in november charging the 
law is too vague and too broad and violates first amendment rights 
to free expression 
assistant attorney general douglas h wilkins argued that the 
case was moot because united oil has never been prosecuted though 
it has sold some 60000 unlabeled paintings since the law was 
passed wilkins argued that the law is intended to prevent deceptive 
advertising and marketing and is constitutional 
abady said his company advertises original oil paintings 
89 and has never had a consumer complaint filed 
were selling bedroom art he said 
one exhibit was a large box of oil paintings including 
landscapes seascapes still lifes and two renditions of what 
appeared to be the same lion in a small and a large size 
these are original oil paintings each one individually done 
abady told the judge as he displayed his wares 
the testimony hinged on what exactly constitutes original 
art artists have complained that the schlock art is 
massproduced often in an assemblyline type process in the far 
east and sold here as original they claim some of the 
massmarket offerings are copies of paintings by american artists 
living or dead 
abady testified that he has never seen mechanical reproduction of 
paintings and does not believe such assembly lines exist 
united oil buys paintings from artists in the far east the 
dominican republic and the united states and from art brokers in 
bunches of 100 to 2000 at a time but never without viewing each 
individual painting first he said each is signed by the artist he 
said 
the paintings are sold in seaside art galleries and outlets from 
florida to rockport and in shopping malls up and down the east 
coast generating 55 million in sales last year he said 
abady was scheduled to be crossexamined today attorneys said 
the trial is expected to wrap up in three days

civil racketeering case against the teamsters may lead the nations 
largest union into the mainstream of honest unionism a federal 
judge says 
the leaders of this union have today done their members a great 
service us district judge david n edelstein said tuesday 
before signing the settlement 
in signing the pact reached just before the case was to go to 
trial monday edelstein noted that the union has had a long and 
sordid career of corruption and involvement with criminal elements 
but in agreeing to the settlement which will implement sweeping 
reforms including the direct election of the unions top leadership 
teamsters officials were promising to keep the 16 million member 
organization free from the influence of organized crime said 
the judge 
us attorney benito romano said the settlement represents a 
major milestone in the governments 30year war to clean up 
pervasive la cosa nostra corruption in the teamsters union 
asked if the war was over however romano conceded no 
james grady the unions general counsel called the agreement 
satisfactory 
but teamsters president william j mccarthy one of the 
individual defendants in the case was less enthusiastic 
while i reluctantly accept the terms of the consent order i 
believe it is not the vindication and exoneration teamsters deserve 
the fact is this suit should never have been filed in the first 
place mccarthy said in a statement 
under the tentative agreement three courtappointed watchdogs 
will oversee the entire union for three years 
edelstein who received the settlement monday afternoon delayed 
approving it to clarify ambiguities 
the main change made at the judges request was that the 
government and the teamsters will agree on two names to submit to 
the judge for each of the watchdog positions so that six names 
instead of three will be offered for the three posts 
the lawsuit filed last june sought to oust the unions 
allegedly mobinfluenced executive board it claimed the teamsters 
leadership had been dominated by organized crime which deprived 
union members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering 
and a campaign of fear that included 20 murders dozens of 
bombings beatings bribes extortion and theft 
most of the 26 reputed mobsters originally named defendants were 
dismissed when they either agreed or were ordered to drop any 
involvement with the teamsters five including convicted colombo 
crime family boss carmine junior persico have been severed from 
the case and are to be tried later 
as a result of the agreement the unions top leaders will be 
elected directly by the membership in secret ballot votes beginning 
in 1991 
currently delegates to the national convention pick the 
executive board members by roll call vote 
the three overseers will be appointed for three years by the 
judge with the joint approval of both sides one would investigate 
and prosecute alleged union corruption one would administer 
disciplinary action and the third would oversee elections 
after the 1991 union elections are certified the overseers will 
be replaced by an independent review board empowered to investigate 
and remedy allegations of corruption 
the reforms said the judge affords some hope that the union 
will become part of the mainstream of honest unionism

nurses are writing letters to nbctv to stop 
nightingales a show about studentnurses that the reallife 
practitioners say reduces them to a bunch of sluts 
why dont they just go ahead and do a show about lingerie 
models instead said carol grimaldi an american nurses 
association spokeswoman 
some nurses complain that the actresses who portray the five 
studentnurses are frequently undressed and dont spend much time 
studying 
nbc defended the show saying a registered nurse reviews each 
script 
basically it has to be viewed as an entertainment drama 
said merry aronson a publicist for the show it just happens to 
be that these girls are studying nursing 
grimaldi said nightingales couldnt come at a worse time as 
nursing schools are beginning to overcome recent enrollment drops 
things are looking up and then this comes along she said 
tuesday 
nightingales belittles the profession because it consists of 
little sex kittens under the guise of going through a nurses 
training program she said 
we do not want this type of image on tv youre reducing nurses 
to a bunch of sluts said dorothy luniewski an instructor at 
framingham union hospital school of nursing 
the kansas city mobased nurses association is encouraging 
nurses to write to nbc to protest the show and is distributing a 
list of the shows advertisers to its 186000 members in efforts to 
widen the campaign grimaldi said 
nurses have been upset with their smallscreen portrayals before 
including china beach a story of vietnam nurses but reaction 
to nightingales far outweighs previous gripes said lynette 
aznabourian spokeswoman for the massachusetts nursing association 
it is so blatantly sexually oriented aznabourian said 
the show produced by charlies angels creator aaron 
spelling is his first offering on nbc since his longtime contract 
with abc expired it is broadcast at 10 pm est on wednesdays and 
has performed well against its competition of cbss wiseguy and 
abcs china beach 
suzanne pleshette stars as den mother to the young nursing 
students 
nightingales writerproducer don roos said he agrees that the 
stars spend a little too much time in their underwear 
we are trying to be more sensitive to the amount of undress 
that these women are in he said 
the hospital shower a frequent target of the reallife nurses 
wont be around if the show is renewed next season roos said 
but he said many of the nurses criticisms are unfocused and 
unfair 
we always wanted to show that they the characters had 
personal lives as well he said 
linda klein the nurse who reviews nightingales scripts said 
she has ordered changes in some scenes adding 
i think these nurses forget and i think that what theyre 
really irate about is maybe were showing students a little 
subservient of the doctors

prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc cemented its domination of israeli local government by 
defeating the rival labor party in 11 election runoffs 
results published today also showed a victory for islamic 
fundamentalists who wrested control of two more local councils in 
arab villages from popular nonreligious parties 
the runoffs were held tuesday in 27 townships and cities where 
candidates failed to win a minimum of 40 percent of vote in local 
elections held feb 28 
the likuds gains mean the party now controls 44 townships as 
compared to only 26 in 1983 elections the leftleaning labor party 
won eight councils tuesday bringing its total to 32 a significant 
decline from 54 in 1983 
shamir has said the results represent a vote of confidence for 
likuds policy of rejecting territorial concessions or any dialogue 
with the plo labor has said local issues had an effect on the 
outcomes 
foreign minister moshe arens who is in washington to discuss 
middle east peace prospects with american leaders telephoned his 
party headquarters in tel aviv to praise their victory israeli 
radio stations reported 
this is a continuation of the likuds big achievements arens 
was quoted as saying 
boaz shapira a political science professor at tel aviv 
university said the polling results indicated a new tendency an 
upheaval 
the likud is now adding local government to its control of 
central government he said on army radio 
labor leaders did not concede defeat however and voiced 
satisfaction over winning tight races in two key traditional likud 
strongholds the tel aviv suburb of rehovot and beit shemesh on the 
outskirts of jerusalem 
we have won proof that we are capable of beating the likud 
labor secretary general micha harish said on the radio 
whoever was eulogizing the labor party was making a big 
mistake labors leader and finance minister shimon peres was 
quoted by the radio as saying 
islamic fundamentalists meanwhile emerged victorious in the 
arab villages of rahad and jaljoulya the fundamentalists success 
has sparked concern among israeli officials who fear a rise of arab 
nationalism among israeli arabs

officials in california praised a new federal import ban on 
semiautomatic weapons but some gun store owners predicted it will 
whet the publics appetite for the firearms 
i cant stop shaking from the excitement said state 
assemblyman michael roos of los angeles author of a bill approved 
monday by the california assembly that would virtually ban the sale 
of of more than 40 types of semiautomatic assault weapons 
not in my wildest imagination would i have ever dreamed that 
within 24 hours of the assembly taking action that the united states 
government would effectively ban the importation of these 
weapons 
the bush administration order issued tuesday suspends the 
importation of more than 110000 assaulttype weapons for which 
import applications are pending said national drug control director 
william j bennett 
affected by the decision are imports of ak47s uzi carbines 
fnfal and fnfnctype weapons as well as steyr aug semiautomatic 
weapons 
on jan 17 a disturbed drifter patrick purdy used an ak47 to 
kill five children and wound 30 other people at a stockton calif 
elementary school 
using the weapon which allows the shooter to fire single shots 
as quickly as he can pull the trigger purdy was able to fire 106 
bullets in two minutes he then shot and killed himself with a 
handgun 
a rising death toll from the use of semiautomatic weapons in gang 
warfare had already prompted an outcry against the guns but the 
stockton tragedy crystallized opposition and led to a nationwide 
movement to ban assault weapons 
the weapons have already been banned by ordinances in los angeles 
and cleveland 
this is great news todays action is long overdue and i urge 
the administration to make it permanent california attorney 
general john van de kamp said of the federal import ban i 
strongly encourage the president and the congress to follow 
californias lead and enact legislation to permanently ban assault 
weapons 
van de kamp said he thought the stockton shootings and the 
legislatures move to restrict assault weapons in california have 
had a tremendous impact on the administrations thinking on this 
issue 
los angeles police chief daryl f gates called the import ban a 
step in the right direction 
the bush administrations action tuesday also brought praise from 
robert strang a spokesman for the drug enforcement administration 
in new york 
certainly anything thats done is helpful to us strang 
said in the last year agents across the country have been issued 
submachine guns because of the automatic weapons that were up 
against on a daily basis certainly anything we can do to 
lessen the firepower of the drug traffickers is going to be 
beneficial to us 
but in dallas some gun store owners predicted the ban on 
imported assault rifles will increase weapons sales 
ill probably have 200 calls tomorrow said charles zuber 
owner of guns unlimited anytime you tell people they cant have 
something they want to have it

red snyder who is charged with murder in the stabbing death of 
another inmate during a jan 1 1986 riot at the state prison at

we asked for a mistrial over concerns for our own safety 
gossett said how do you go down and talk to a group of people who 
just murdered somebody and have a meaningful conversation 
marshall county assistant prosecuting attorney jeffrey kessler 
said he was unsure whether he would ask for a new trial saying 
whats the use 
snyder already is serving a life sentence without parole for

in what legal authorities called the nations 
first international telephone plea a federal judge heard a prison 
inmate in canada plead guilty to drug charges 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise sat at the head of a 
conference table in his chambers tuesday as claude tremblay admitted 
participating in a northern new jerseybased drug ring prosecuted in 
1982 
defense attorneys the prosecutor news reporters and the court 
reporter listened to tremblays voice over a loudspeaker 
tremblay spoke from archambault prison near montreal where he is 
serving a sevenyear jail term for an unrelated armed robbery 
debevoise sentenced him to five years probation 
i havent heard of a guilty plea by phone said david 
sellers a spokesman for the federal administrative office of the 
courts in washington 
theres a whole wave a big push to be innovative in a 
technological sense among courts he said a number of state 
courts arraign defendants by phone and in some courts lawyers are 
allowed to file lawsuits by facsimile sellers said 
arguments on pretrial motions or emergency search warrant 
applications are more examples of telephone use by the courts said 
lloyd weinreb a professor at harvard law school 
weinreb said a phone plea is not something im aware of but it 
doesnt strike me as very remarkable 
the longdistance hearing took 1 years to arrange and needed 
approval from the us state and justice departments debevoise and 
canadian authorities said attorneys in the case 
after the initial chuckle everybody said theres nothing that 
says you cant do it said michael v gilberti senior trial 
attorney in the us attorneys office who arranged the plea 
as part of the plea the government agreed not to pursue 
additional charges if any against tremblay 50 in exchange for 
his guilty plea to a drug conspiracy tremblay was indicted in 
november 1982 with 21 other people in a largescale drug operation 
that distributed cocaine amphetamines and quaaludes 
tremblay admitted helping supply the group with quaaludes 
according to the probation department all but two of the other 
defendants pleaded guilty one is a fugitive and the other had 
charges dismissed 
tremblay a montrealborn former construction worker was 
arrested on a new jersey warrant in canada in january 1985 a month 
later canadian authorities implicated him in a 1984 armored car 
heist in ottawa he pleaded guilty to that charge and went to jail 
in 1987 
in a plea agreement dated sept 4 1987 tremblay agreed to waive 
his right to be present before a judge and to submit himself to the 
jurisdiction of federal court in new jersey he also agreed not to 
fight extradition in turn the government said it wouldnt oppose a 
request by tremblay to serve a prison term on the drug charge in 
canada 
defense attorney john iannuzzi who specializes in defending 
people in canada charged with crimes in the united states sees a 
future for such phone pleas 
if we can get to the point where we can eliminate extra expense 
and avoid getting people here from all over the world it would 
certainly expedite the system of justice he said

egyptians today raised their flag over this 
longdisputed red sea resort as an israeli convoy pulled out ending 
a territorial dispute that bedeviled the neighbors relations for 
seven years 
egyptian troops carrying rifles entered the 250acre strip of 
beach in groups of three hundreds of egyptian workers climbed a 
hill overlooking the resort sang their national anthem and chanted 
allahu akbar god is great 
at the same time a convoy of dozens of israeli buses police 
vehicles and cars left taba along with about 50 protesting hotel 
workers who sang israels national anthem two israeli patrol boats 
stood off the beach 
a contingent of greenbereted israeli border police stopped to 
shake hands with egyptian police before departing 
a large israeli flag was defiantly waved from the top floor 
window of the 10story sonesta hotel apparently by an israeli hotel 
guest as the egyptians raised their black white and red flag 
the israelis had lowered their flag during the night 
todays pullout was preceded by lastminute demonstrations by 
some of the sonestas 350 israeli workers who fear losing their 
jobs and demand that israel guarantee the jobs or provide 
compensation 
during the flagraising hotel workers burned tires on a hill 
overlooking the hotel sending up a large column of black smoke 
we want our rights the government is prepared to give back the 
land but they cant give us up an israeli woman shouted at 
police who had arrested several workers earlier 
israel radio broadcast live from the scene from this moment 
taba is egyptian the announcer said dramatically 
yitzhak lior deputy director general of the israeli foreign 
ministry and the senior israeli present said we went to court 
and this was the decision at the bottom line we arrived at a 
mutual compromise without scars 
ahmed al masiri egypts counselgeneral in the adjacent israeli 
resort of eilat was quoted by israel radio as saying the path to 
improved relations between the former adversaries was now open 
i hope this will be a bridge to peace peace between the two 
peoples he was quoted as saying 
however yossi ahimeir a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak 
shamir of israel said we are not celebrating we are sad that we 
have been forced to give up taba never mind the reason but we 
accept the decision and we are carrying it out 
the turnover came seven years after israel ended a staged pullout 
from the sinai peninsula which it captured in the 1967 middle east 
war and returned as part of a usmediated peace treaty signed 
march 26 1979 
tabas return also comes at a time of increased pressure on 
israel to yield the occupied west bank and gaza strip in exchange 
for peace under pressure of the 15month palestinian uprising 
butros ghali egypts minister of state for foreign affairs said 
resolving the conflict over taba peacefully is a victory for the 
rule of international law and the provisions of the 1979 treaty 
the taba agreement worked out with international arbitration and 
us mediation calls for the hotel to be sold to egypt for 37 
million and the adjacent holiday village of thatched beach huts was 
sold for 15 million 
there appeared to be no refusal by israelis to leave taba as 
there was in sinai when authorities had to forcibly remove israeli 
settlers from the town of yamit 
on the beach green bereted israeli border police emptied their 
guard hut at the former barbed wire frontier and left 
nearby dudu oren 31 a lifeguard at taba beach for eight years 
cleared out his shack and piled his belongings on the beach 
oren said he had been married on the beach in taba and gave his 
2yearold son the hebrew name of yam for the sea that laps its 
shores 
he said his whole life was tied up in taba but that he hoped his 
leaving will be good for peace

a government inquiry said today sudden 
weather changes and problems with the flight control system caused 
the crash of the first jas 39 gripen swedens new combat plane 
the feb 2 crash came at a time when the government already was 
reconsidering the 55 billion plane the countrys biggest defense 
project because of delays and escalating costs the pilot suffered 
a broken arm 
the industrial group jas a consortium of swedish companies is 
under contract to start deliveries to the air force in 1992 the 
jets will replace aging viggen planes 
rune lundin a member of the commission that investigated the 
crash told a news conference the prototype was known to have an 
oversensitive flight control system which is regulated by computers 
he said computer software had not been adjusted before the crash 
but that test pilots were instructed to compensate for the 
sensitivity with the control stick 
however the weather worsened during flight with winds exceeding 
the approved limit the commission said gusts of wind reached 28 mph 
instead of 22 mph as predicted 
defense minister roine carlsson said he was waiting for a more 
extensive inquiry due by the end of may before he would comment on 
the future of the project

jewish settlers moved tractors and mobile homes 
to a west bank hilltop today starting the first new settlement in 
the occupied territories since the november elections 
the settlement started the same day that israel withdrew from the 
red sea resort of taba handing sovereignty over to egypt after 
seven years of squabbling 
uri ariel head of the west bank settlement council said the 
west bank construction work was israels response to the withdrawal 
from taba 
its a good start that we are building a settlement in the land 
of israel ariel said on israel radio maybe its also a special 
day when they are folding the israeli flag in taba 
however there was opposition to the settlement in israels 
divided government 
elsewhere in the west bank three palestinians including a 
9yearold boy were shot and wounded in clashes with israeli 
troops arab hospital officials said the army said it was checking 
the report 
in the occupied gaza strip the army arrested palestinians 
suspected of killing two palestinian hospital workers who cooperated 
with israel an army spokesman said he identified the leader of the 
hit squad as a member of fatah the mainstream plo faction headed by 
yasser arafat 
during house searches troops confiscated a submachine gun seven 
handguns and a typewriter used to write threatening letters to 
people who allegedly collaborate with the occupation government the 
spokesman said 
israeli officials have said attacks by palestinians against 
collaborators are in violation of arafats pledge that the palestine 
liberation organization has abandoned terror 
at least 396 palestinians and 17 israelis have been killed since 
the palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the occupied 
territories broke out dec 8 1987 
tractors today plowed a hilltop northwest of the west bank town 
of ramallah to prepare the proposed settlement of talmon said 
yehuda hasani a settler spokesman 
three mobile homes later moved to the site despite heavy rain 
hail and fog hasani said 15 families were expected to move to 
talmon within a few days 
ariel said settlers had received all necessary government permits 
to build the settlement 
the government a coalition of the rightwing likud bloc and the 
leftleaning labor party has authorized the construction of eight 
settlements during its fouryear term which expires in 1992 the 
settlements include talmon 
housing ministry spokesman amos hadad said about 80000 jewish 
settlers live in 103 settlements in the west bank and gaza strip 
about 17 million palestinians live in the territories which israel 
took from egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war

a taperecorded account of a teenagers 
torture murder and mutilation brought tears from a juror and sobs 
from the killer 
i cant stop john r weber 25 of phillips said halfway 
through tuesdays playing of the tape that he told authorities he 
made to scare his wife 
the outburst prompted judge gary carlson to order one of several 
brief recesses in the sanity phase of webers trial which was to 
continue today 
the jury is considering whether weber was sane and can be held 
responsible for the 1986 slaying of carla lenz his 17yearold 
sisterinlaw and the attempted murder of his wife on sept 3 
weber put his hands over his ears and sobbed tuesday as the 
cassette tape that investigators found in his car was played for the 
jury

the dead girl and later eating it a juror put her hand to her mouth 
and began crying the judge called an immediate recess and the jury 
left the courtroom 
the jury had heard an edited version of the tape without 
references to cannibalism and a feeling of being two persons during 
the first part of the trial at that time weber was not in the 
courtroom and the jurors sat expressionless 
weber was convicted monday of mutilating and sexually assaulting 
miss lenz he had pleaded guilty to murdering the teenager and 
attempting to murder his wife but he also pleaded innocent by 
reason of mental disease or defect to all charges 
defense attorney john reid told the jury he wanted them to hear 
the whole tape as difficult as that is so they could better 
judge webers mind 
if a jury decides weber could not control his actions because of 
mental illness he will be committed for treatment with any 
possible release to be determined by a court 
if he is found sane he will be sent to prison where he faces a 
maximum sentence of life plus more than 250 years 
the defense described weber as a loner and bedwetter whose 
problems were diagnosed by two psychiatrists as a disorder of sexual 
sadism

cigarette pins and wooden wheelbarrow handles he was accused of 
using a lighted cigar safety pin and wheelbarrow handle to assault

two transit authority police officers face up to 
71 years in prison each for arresting people on trumpedup charges 
on the subways 
a federal jury tuesday convicted officers alphonse iannacone 42 
an 18year veteran and mary mcdermott 32 a member of the force 
since 1980 of conspiracy and deprivation of civil rights after 
three days of deliberations 
shouts of oh no and how could they do this came from 
sobbing spectators including the officers mothers as the verdict 
was read 
sentencing was set for may 10 
the charges stemmed from a series of arrests the officers made in 
1983 and 1984 while on plainclothes duty 
prosecutors said the officers were trying to improve their arrest 
records to advance their careers defense attorneys said the 
officers had no motive to fabricate crimes since thousands of real 
thefts and assaults occur in the subways every year 
its really hard for a police officer to get a fair trial 
said defense attorney barry agulnick he and the other defense 
lawyer kenneth kaplan said they would appeal 
federal prosecutors called more than 20 witnesses including the 
eight men arrested by iannacone and mcdermott and the eight 
victims of the men 
the men all of whom were black hispanic or asian described 
how they were taken off subway trains arrested handcuffed and 
detained on charges of either sexual abuse or attempted grand 
larceny 
the alleged victims seven women and one man described their 
shock when they learned they were listed as the complainants in the 
cases against the men the women said they had not sought police 
assistance and had not felt anyone touching them in a lewd way the 
man said he was not a pickpocket victim 
the defense called just two witnesses a transit police 
lieutenant explained that discrepancies between arresting officers 
notes and those of the prosecutor are not uncommon 
a clinical psychologist testified that victims of sex abuse often 
deny it occurred 
transit police chief vincent del castillo said in a statement 
while we can never be pleased by the conviction of any police 
officers we are pleased that this old and lingering issue has 
finally been resolved

two teenage arab guerrillas crossed the 
egyptian border today and attacked an israeli military outpost in 
the occupied gaza strip with rifles and hand grenades the army 
said the guerrillas were captured and wounded 
a military source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 3 
am attack failed when a grenade hurled at the israeli camp rolled 
back onto the guerrillas position and exploded injuring the two 
arabs soldiers opened fire after hearing an explosion 
no israeli soldiers were hurt the attack came on the day israel 
withdrew from the red sea resort of taba and handed sovereignty to 
egypt 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai head of israels southern command 
said the guerrillas belong to a fundamentalist group known as jihad 
islami or islamic holy war 
the guerrillas aged 15 and 17 carried sovietmade automatic 
ak47 rifles a swedishmade karl gustav submachine gun and six 
soviet f1 hand grenades the army said it said the teenagers were 
from the canada palestinian refugee camp in egypt 
sources who demanded anonymity said a third person perhaps 
acting as a scout slipped back across the border and avoided 
capture 
mordechai said the attack was carried out with the knowledge of 
plo chief yasser arafat and his fatah guerrillas 
to the best of our knowledge the ring was prepared and trained 
in the canada refugee camp in egyptian rafah and from there they 
went with a scout to our territory he said 
according to the terrorists being questioned the ring acted 
and was sent by jihad islami they went with the knowledge of 
fatah and with the knowledge of abu ammar arafat 
israel radio said the goal of the guerrillas was to kill 
soldiers take hostages and return to egypt the guerrillas were 
promised 20000 for making the attack it claimed 
the last infiltration from egypt came on dec 29 when israeli 
soldiers shot and killed three men who crossed the border it was 
not known if the infiltrators were smugglers or guerrillas 
in march 1988 three palestinians crossed the egyptian border and 
hijacked a bus they killed three israeli civilians before they were 
shot to death the plos force 17 unit claimed responsibility 
todays infiltration came amid reported efforts by us officials 
to work out a ceasefire between israel and the palestine liberation 
organization to stop infiltrations from lebanon 
army officials estimate about 30 guerrillas have been killed in 
south lebanon during infiltration attempts since the beginning of 
the year 
the united states has asked the plo to halt such attacks but the 
plo said attacks on military targets were not included when arafat 
renounced terrorism last december

budget for the 1989 fiscal year after a threemonth dispute over the 
size of defense expenditures the official tanjug news agency 
reported 
it said that because of inflation the federal budget of 3 
billion was 165 percent higher than last years figure the

all other expenditures are covered by the individual budgets of 
the countrys six member republics 
the spending plan devotes 2 billion or 49 percent of the gross 
national product for the military tanjug said a proposal to spend 
52 percent of the gnp on defense was defeated after it was opposed

eastern airlines pilots accusing chairman frank lorenzo of 
gross mismanagement and incompetence has asked a bankruptcy 
judge to appoint an independent trustee to run the strikecrippled 
carrier 
the request tuesday by the air line pilots association coincided 
with the unions approval of 2400amonth strike pay for the 3600 
pilots who were bolstered by a federal appeals courts refusal to 
force them back to work 
in papers filed in us bankruptcy court in new york the pilots 
charged that lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp 
intends to dismantle eastern 
the new york times reported today that lorenzo has asked drexel 
burnham lambert inc easterns regular investment banker to 
determine what interest there may be among investors and other 
airlines in buying eastern texas air had weighed the possible sale 
of eastern even before the strike 
the idea of selling eastern was raised at a texas air board 
meeting last week the times reported 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said he could not immediately 
comment on the report and texas airs public relations office was 
not open early today 
in other developments in the 12dayold strike by the airlines 
8500member machinist union 
a us house vote was expected today on a proposal to put 
striking workers back on the job while a federal review panel 
studies the 17monthold contract stalemate but the legislation 
even if passed isnt given much chance of surviving a presidential 
veto 
the airline which struggled to run less than 10 percent of its 
prestrike schedule won bankruptcy court approval tuesday for a 
plan to help ticket holders grounded by the walkout 
in a show of support with eastern pilots the pilots union 
announced its 41000 members at 47 airlines will be assessed 300 
each to help pay for the strike benefits the union also agreed to 
refuse to fly planes and routes purchased from eastern unless 
eastern pilots are hired for the work 
the machinists whose strike began march 4 when they refused to 
accept 125 million in concessions asked the bankruptcy court to 
free 8 million in paychecks due last friday and 1 million in 
insurance premiums 
it is not known when us bankruptcy judge burton lifland will 
rule on the request for a trustee 
the pilots charge that lorenzo is dismantling eastern is based 
in part on his tentative deal to sell its profitable northeast 
shuttle to developer donald trump for 365 million 
lorenzos stripping of easterns valuable assets constitutes 
at a minimum gross mismanagement and incompetence the pilots 
union said 
the charge was denied by the miamibased carrier which filed for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection thursday 
the intention is to keep the airline flying said eastern 
spokesman art kent that is the point we have said that if 
necessary assets will be sold to maintain liquidity 
with eastern ticket holders clamoring for refunds the carrier 
announced an estimated 200 million compensation package that 
provides for some firstclass upgrades and travel vouchers 
under the plan which won liflands approval tickets and 
reservations frozen by the bankruptcy filing will be accepted and 
most travelers will receive firstclass seats those holding tickets 
for routes canceled by eastern can exchange for travel credits on 
easterns present flights otherwise ticket holders can wait until 
eastern resumes operation on the original route and take a companion 
at half price 
its sister airline continental will continue to honor eastern 
tickets as eastern continues to work with other airlines to help 
establish policies for acceptance of eastern tickets the company 
said in a statement 
in other developments 
at a rally in miami mary jane barry president of the 
transport workers union local representing flight attendants told a 
crowd of 750 that an anticontinental campaign would begin thursday 
in denver one of the carriers hubs she would not elaborate 
in atlanta the 11th us circuit court of appeals refused to 
force the pilots back to work but set a march 23 hearing in 
tallahassee fla for a threejudge panel to review the airlines 
request for such action 
several major domestic carriers have asked a us district 
court judge in washington to issue a permanent ban on sympathy 
strikes by machinists a ruling was expected this week 
federal courts continued to block attempts by union leaders to 
organize rail worker strikes in new york and philadelphia 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis threw his support to 
strikers at a rally attended by 1000 eastern machinists and 
sympathizers at a rally in boston

thousands of people dressed in national 
colors and precommunist coats of arms jammed a budapest square 
today to support calls for freedom on the anniversary of hungarys 
1848 revolt against austria 
for the first time in 41 years the anniversary of the 
monthslong revolution was a legal public holiday a symbol of 
hungarys increasingly independent course and democratic reforms 
many used the day off to go shopping in neighboring austria for 
the electronic gadgets and other goods that are in short supply in 
hungary 
but thousands more massed at communist party gatherings and 
independent rallies calls for a neutral independent hungary and 
criticism of the soviet union punctuated todays rallies 
about 50000 people at a rally in budapest applauded a call from 
independent groups for more rights and freedom 
not only should march 15 be a day of freedom but the 16th 
17th 18th and all the other days of the year declared denes 
csengey a leader of the hungarian democratic forum one of the 
largest of hungarys new independent groups 
shouts of we demand we demand rang out as speakers read a 
proposal for free elections disbanding of paramilitary police 
forces and the creation of a national holiday on oct 23 the start 
of the 1956 antisoviet revolt 
todays ceremonies began with an official wreathlaying and a 
party rally outside the national museum 
for the first time communist party speakers such as leading 
communist reformer reszoe nyers shared the rostrum with leaders from 
the social democrats and the smallholders party two parties formed 
recently 
nyers won applause from the crowd of 60000 when he said that 
hungarian policy from 1948 to 1956 was largely steered by the 
kremlin 
he also charged that under the leadership of soviet president 
leonid brezhnev an antireform spirit blew from moscow across 
eastern europe and choked hungarian reforms 
after the official rally about 40000 people converged on a 
monument to sandor petoefi the firebrand poet of the shortlived 
1848 revolt to hear speakers from independent groups 
although reforms have legalized the new independent groups and 
the communist party has agreed in principle to a multiparty system 
hungarian activists are pressing for more freedom and greater 
independence within the soviet bloc 
during todays rally a banner reading independent hungary 
fluttered on a nearby bridge another huge banner with the words 
56 68 81 and the national flags of hungary czechoslovakia and 
poland recalled the violent suppression of reforms in those 
countries in those years 
the march 15 anniversary has been an occasion for anticommunist 
rallies by dissidents and unofficial groups since the early 1970s 
in 1986 riot police brutally dispersed crowds who took part in 
that years rally and last year eight leading dissidents were 
detained on the anniversary and police broke up an evening march 
this year the official dailies published the schedule of the 
independent groups police helicopters occasionally buzzed over 
demonstrators but there was no police interference

life expectancy of white americans continues to 
increase while that of blacks declines and other significant health 
differences between caucasians and minorities remain according to 
government statistics released today 
the figures contained in an annual public health service report 
show that blacks are dying younger than whites blacks are twice as 
likely to die in infancy as whites and substantially fewer black 
women who are pregnant receive early prenatal care 
the report shows as have others for as long as they have been 
issued that there is a disparity between the health of our white 
and black populations said health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan 
the report is a compilation of statistics previously released by 
the national center for health statistics which is part of the 
health service it is based on figures for the years 1970 through 
1986 the latest year for which comprehensive data is available 
while life expectancy at birth for whites increased from 753 
years in 1985 to 754 in 1986 life expectancy for blacks declined 
from 695 to 694 during the period the report said for all 
americans life expectancy was 748 in 1986 up from 747 the year 
before 
for whites and the overall population the figures were the same 
in 1984 as in 1985 but for blacks the 1986 decline in life 
expectency followed a similar one in 1985 when it was 697 which 
sullivan called a disturbing trend 
the report said the lifespan declines among blacks were the 
result of increases in deaths from aids homicides influenza and 
pneumonia 
i think the basic things related to nutrition poverty access 
to health care affect a wide variety of conditions from infant 
mortality to mortality at later ages and also is probably related to 
mortality from drugrelated violence said dr manning feinleib 
director of the national center for health statistics 
among the reports other findings 
live births to unmarried women more than doubled from 1970 to 
1986 from 11 percent to 23 percent of all births in 1986 11 
percent of women of asian and pacific islander descent who gave 
birth were unmarried compared with 16 percent of white women 42 
percent of american indian women and 61 percent of black women 
between 1970 and 1986 deaths from heart disease declined by 31 
percent although it remains the leading cause of death in america 
during the same period death from stroke the thirdleading cause 
dropped by 53 percent declines in smoking are believed to be the 
reason for the declines 
accidents including motor vehicle accidents were the 
fourthleading cause of death in the country in 1986 and the most 
frequent cause of death before age 65 among males 
although homicide ranks 12th among all causes for death it 
takes nearly as many lives as accidental injuries for black males 
who die before they are 65 
these data point us in the direction of expanding our agenda in 
the upcoming decade to include a greater focus on such critical 
health areas as prevention of aids unintentional injuries homicide 
and suicide many of which demand individual and societal 
behavioral change sullivan said at a news briefing on the report

air force investigators looking into a 
helicopter crash that killed 15 servicemen are considering factors 
such as weather maintenance and weight but have ruled out a suspect 
rotor fastener a spokesman said 
the ch3e jolly green giant helicopter carrying 11 green 
berets engaged in desert training and four air force crewmen 
crashed sunday night in the desert 25 miles from davismonthan air 
force base 
capt carlos roque a davismonthan spokesman said tuesday that 
use of nightvision goggles which have been implicated in numerous 
military helicopter crashes have been eliminated as a possible 
cause 
investigators also ruled out the main rotor shaft nut a fastener 
about a foot in diameter that holds the main rotor head to the 
helicopter frame maj fran turnstall said 
it had been checked two days before the crash as part of a 
program to inspect more than 300 ch3es and similar helicopters 
belonging to the air force navy and coast guard for defective nuts 
spokesmen said 
turnstall said it was removed inspected and found to be 
adequate but another pentagon spokesmen air force lt col darrel 
hayes said the nut had been replaced friday 
after the crash the nut was found in place ruling out the 
possibility it disengaged and allowed the rotor blades to strike the 
aircraft turnstall said 
roque said that while other maintenance issues weather and the 
loading of the helicopter were studied the five remaining ch3es 
belonging to the 71st special operations command at davismonthan 
remained out of service tuesday 
at some point they will be permitted to fly again after 
something is done probably an inspection or a changeover of some 
sort or whatever the investigators recommend roque said

the bush administration is considering several 
options on the future of the american embassy chancery in moscow a

razing the chancery and building a new one that could cost an 
estimated 500 million 
dismantling and rebuilding three stories and constructing an 
annex for the most sensitive work as suggested in a study by former

pan am warned passengers of a bomb threat received 
prior to a transatlantic flight this week unlike in december when 
the threat to flight 103 was disclosed only to the government a 
newspaper reported today 
however the airline did not notify passengers until 15 minutes 
after the delayed flights scheduled departure time leading to 
complaints the boston globe reported 
pan am knew about it and did nothing to forewarn passengers and 
give them an option until the last minute passenger marilyn 
harding told the newspaper in a telephone interview from paris 
she was one of about 17 passengers who changed travel 
arrangements after the airline announced an anonymous telephone 
caller claimed a bomb would be put on the flight monday from new 
york to tel aviv via paris the newspaper said 
most of the flights 200 passengers apparently felt confident 
that their plane would not meet the same fate as pan am flight 103 
which exploded over lockerbie scotland dec 21 killing all 259 
passengers and 11 people on the ground 
i left harding said who wants to spend eight hours up 
there just wondering i think those people took a real gamble 
pan am spokesman alan loflin said that the aircraft passengers 
and their baggage all were carefully screened and that officials 
were satisfied all appropriate measures had been taken when the 
plane took off 
loflin told the associated press today he did not know whether 
any airline ever had similarly notified passengers of a bomb threat 
the flight arrived at its destination without incident 
sen alfonse damato rny on tuesday proposed legislation 
that would force airlines to notify passengers of serious threats to 
international flights 
its absolutely unconscionable that information regarding a 
serious terrorist threat was selectively provided to government 
officials and withheld from the passengers and flight crew of pan am 
103 damato said in a statement

the soviets today accused a us military attache 
of spying and ordered him to leave the country in apparent 
retaliation for washingtons expulsion last week of a soviet officer 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said army lt 
col daniel francis van gundy iii an assistant military attache at 
the us embassy in moscow was given 48 hours to leave 
gerasimov said van gundy who had been assigned to the embassy 
for about two years the normal moscow diplomatic tour was declared 
unwelcome because he engaged in espionage 
the 42yearold army officer lives on the us embassy compound 
with his wife susan and two of their three daughters 
on thursday us officials accused soviet lt col yuri n 
pakhtusov of trying to buy computer secrets and ordered him to leave 
the country they did not say how long he had to leave 
gerasimov at a hastily called briefing charged that van gundy 
attempted to enter a closed area deliberately diverting from the 
officially permitted route clandestinely photographed military 
sites and committed other gross violations of the rules of 
diplomatic conduct 
us embassy spokesman richard gilbert said the soviet charges 
were unwarranted inappropriate without justification and 
certainly in no way in keeping with the positive tone of the 
ussoviet relationship 
gilbert the embassy press attache suggested the soviet action 
was in retaliation for the us expulsion of pakhtusov 
in washington state department spokeswoman anita stockman called 
the expulsion unwarranted she said we are considering our 
response but declined to elaborate 
van gundy refused to answer questions from reporters as he walked 
to his office he specifically refused comment on gerasimovs 
allegation that warnings had already been issued to the lieutenant 
colonel 
gerasimov said the us administration is revealing its 
foreign policy and we have this problem of spy mania 
he cited a recent time magazine cover story on the 1987 marine 
spy scandal in moscow and said there had been other attempts to 
incite fears of espionage by unnamed american leaders uninterested 
in improving ussoviet relations 
were not the ones who initiated this process gerasimov 
said tacitly acknowledging the connection between last weeks 
incident and the expulsion of van gundy 
using almost the same words gilbert used to denounce todays 
action gerasimov called the expulsion of pakhtusov a provocation 
uncalled for and unjustified it does not fit in with the trend for 
the positive development of sovietamerican relations 
he called it an artificially cooked scenario clumsily carried 
out by the fbi 
pakhtusov was accused of receiving sensitive information about 
how the us government protects computer secrets the state 
department said he was caught in a sixmonth fbi probe after he 
approached an unidentified american employee of a firm that deals in 
classified information 
the soviet government rejected the charge and accused the united 
states of a deliberate provocation against a soviet diplomatic 
official 
the soviets did not then announce any retaliatory action but 
gerasimov had said in taking the decision to expel pakhtusov 
the us is assuming all responsibilities 
pakhtusov a military attache at the soviet embassy in 
washington was ordered home after the fbi said it caught him 
receiving sensitive information 
a us source alleged the 35yearold soviet was a member of gru 
the soviet militarys intelligence arm 
over the years when one superpower expelled a diplomat on spying 
charges the other nation has responded in kind 
in october 1986 after 25 soviet diplomats were ordered out of 
the soviet un mission in new york the kremlin expelled five 
american diplomats

the copyright office today recommended that 
congress consider legislation protecting makers of future films from 
unauthorized colorization of their work 
the patent and trademark office in a report released at the same 
time recommended that no changes in the trademark law should be 
made but left the door open to changes in copyright law 
both reports were requested by the subcommittee on copyright of 
the house judiciary committee which decided last year that no 
change in copyright laws was needed 
rep robert kastenmeier dwis subcommittee chairman promised 
to review the reports carefully and added we must ask the 
proponents of change to bear the burden of proving that the change 
is necessary fair and practical 
the suggested changes in law would not affect films already made 
the copyright office urged the subcommittee to consider before 
anything else a unified package of legislation covering not only 
film artists but also visual artists such as painters and 
sculptors such legislation would give them moral rights to bar 
alteration of their work such as colorization of films 
the copyright office also said it could support a decision to 
enact artists rights legislation to film makers alone if the 
subcommittee chose to do this if the subcommittee chooses this 
approach the office said it should carefully consider whether 
the existing web of collective and individual bargaining is adequate 
to protect directors legitimate interests 
the copyright office conclusion will i know be a 
disappointment to some in the film industry who seek to maintain the 
status quo kastenmaier said it will likely be welcomed by 
others who seek increased protection for artists 
donald j quigg commissioner of patents and trademarks told the 
subcommittee the trademark law should not be changed because it has 
already been broadly interpreted 
he added we take position at this time on the desirability of 
more extensive moral rights protection for american creative artists 
than is available currently saying only that if such a change is 
made it should not be made in the trademark law

a judge dismissed animal cruelty 
charges against two cambodian refugees who admitted killing a 
4monthold german shepherd for food 
under the facts i dont believe it can be said that these 
defendants inflicted unreasonable pain on the animal municipal 
judge bradford l andrews said tuesday to hold otherwise would 
subject every slaughterhouse employee or farmer to prosecution 
andrews had ruled last week that killing a dog for food was not 
illegal unless the dog was maimed wounded tortured mutilated or 
tormented in a manner beyond that required to prepare it as food 
i am sympathetic to the feelings of those who champion the 
cause of animal rights andrews said but the remedy lies in 
convincing the legislature to enact laws that would make the actions 
of these defendants unlawful 
sokheng chea 32 and seng ou 33 both of long beach said they 
killed the puppy in june by holding the dog down on the kitchen 
floor hitting it over the head with a blunt instrument and slashing 
its throat before they began skinning it 
police alerted by a neighbor who heard the dogs yelps arrested 
the men they were charged with misdemeanors 
i am happy ou speaking through an interpreter said of 
tuesdays ruling but i can assure you that there will be no 
second time 
local asian leaders said that dogs and cats are considered 
delicacies in some southeast asian countries 
local animal rights activists said they were disappointed by the 
outcome 
i think that what these defendants did offends the 
sensibilities of the community said wendy aragon there is a 
need for legislation to outlaw the slaughter of dogs and cats they 
are companion animals not food animals

president mikhail s gorbachev called on the 
communist partys top policymaking body today to take rapid steps 
to ease chronic soviet food shortages but indicated their total 
elimination would take years 
his comments came at a twoday meeting of the 300member central 
committee 
before gorbachev spoke the official tass news agency said the 
central committee elected its senior leaders including gorbachev 
to the nations new parliament the 2250seat congress of peoples 
deputies 
tass said gorbachev today set the task already in the nearest 
future of easing the acuteness of the food problem and in the 
first half of the 90s to guarantee the production of agricultural 
products in sufficient quantity and variety for stable food supply 
tass did not immediately provide details but gorbachevs wording 
indicated the kremlin leadership was resigned to continuing food 
shortages in the next several years 
gorbachev called again for the development of lease 
relations and said one of the most important elements of his 
program for economic reform was the restructuring of relations to 
socialist property 
gorbachev has said he wants to lease stateowned fields to 
farmers which he says will increase productivity because farmers 
can earn more 
in several recent appearances yegor k ligachev who heads the 
partys commission on agriculture has disagreed with gorbachev on 
how to resolve the crisis ligachev has skipped lightly over 
leasing and instead emphasized collective farming the system that 
has left soviet consumers standing in line for meat and vegetables 
no one has proposed allowing farmers to own the land they till or 
breaking up the giant collective and state farms that have been the 
backbone of the soviet agricultural system since the days of josef 
stalin 
whatever the decision on leasing the central committee was 
likely to agree on the need to ease the poverty and isolation of 
rural life 
it is also was expected to order the dismantling at least 
partially of an agricultural superministry created in 1985 
along with the differences in emphasis in gorbachevs and 
ligachevs recent remarks there has been evidence in recent weeks 
that the kremlin leadership has found it difficult to agree on 
agricultural reform 
the central committee meeting on agriculture was originally 
scheduled for february then postponed 
last week the 12member politburos meeting covered agricultural 
reform among other items and ran for two days instead of the usual 
one 
the central committee which last met in january also has the 
power to change the membership of top party bodies like the 
politburo and secretariat 
for the new congress of peoples deputies the communist party is 
one of 30 organizations that will choose a total of onethird of the 
representatives 
despite the publicity touting this campaign as the soviet unions 
first multicandidate election the communist party chose to nominate 
just 100 people for its 100 seats party members had suggested more 
than 31000 names the deputies elected by the party in a secret 
ballot include most members of the 12man ruling politburo 26 
workers and seven collective farmers tass said

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the nation 
march 14 
the evening times pawtucket ri on john tower 
senate republicans and the republican vice president of the 
united states dan quayle have both charged partisan politics in 
the senates refusal to confirm john tower as secretary of defense 
how unfortunately partisan that accusation sounds 
if the shoe were on the other foot a democrat in the white 
house and the gop in control of the senate one would hope that an 
equally secondrate candidate would be given the boot 
tower was not the right person for the job not only because he 
savored the sauce but also because he curried favor with the defense 
industry 
the tower debate was not a question of political power it was a 
question of the lifestyle of a man in control of the nations tanks 
and missiles and he came up short

the brainerd minn daily dispatch on john tower 
to hear some republicans react to the defeat of john tower as 
nominee for secretary of defense youd think the republic was 
coming to an end 
the partisan taste of this debate is going to linger said 
sen robert kasten rwis this is going to make it damn tough for 
us to act in much of a bipartisan manner in the months ahead 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the setback will 
stay in his memory 
fortunately others had a clearer perspective that life goes on 
vice president dan quayle showed he is maturing in the job when 
he said we have a job ahead of us we have an agenda ahead of us 
and were going to need the help and cooperation of the democratic 
congress 
on with the job please

however who tempered their enthusiasm with oldfashioned 
skepticism tom miller iowas attorney general was one 
i heard all the right words miller said however we have 
to recognize that words are the easy part 
as long as the president and millers fellow attorneys general 
also recognize words are the easy part of it the environment

cruiser that mistakenly shot down an iranian airliner in the persian 
gulf last july iran is high on the suspect list 
but whether it was iran one of any iranian extremist faction 
another country or another group response must be swift and severe 
the president should not shy away from a military strike in this 
case 
it is true that there is no sure defense against terrorism but 
it is also true that the best prevention is for outlaw nations and

chicago tribune on bushs slow start 
george bush is beginning to disappoint people who expected him to 
take the presidential baton from ronald reagan and keep the 
governmental relay race going full tilt 
instead he is taking his time sizing up the stadium and 
examining the condition of the track before turning on the speed 
trouble is other things arent standing still 
yet the new administration which has been slow to fill 
subcabinet posts and in no rush to articulate its priorities has 
seemd content with followership rather than leadership sounding 
tough only in its defense of john tower and in its opposition to new 
taxes

the gop is eager to expand its appeal among minorities and the 
howard university administration appeared all too willing to 
cooperate 
lee atwater demonstrated his political acumen by withdrawing 
before the incident could escalate into an even worse embarrassment 
for his party and president george bush 
while the republicans effort to broaden their base is 
commendable it is difficult to feel much compassion for atwater as 
he keeps hitting sour notes in his attempt to play a new theme of

los angeles times on apartheid and religion 
the white branch of the dutch reformed church in south africa has 
found apartheid a sin four years after officially rejecting the 
concept of racial segregation a finding that will at least postpone 
a formal break with the larger black and mixedrace branches of the 
church 
but the white branch has once again shied away from agreement on 
tactics such as civil disobedience that have been proposed to 
accelerate the glacial progress away from apartheid 
but disillusionment has followed so many official rejections of 
apartheid the rejections have not been matched by substantial 
progress toward reform 
apartheid is officially opposed by the government of south africa 
and by most political forces only the farright conservative party 
which advocates firm restoration of racial segregation remains 
firmly committed to apartheid

the newsreview roseburg ore on a youth service corps 
a major test of whether a new social ethos is indeed emerging may 
be the fate of proposals in congress to establish a voluntary 
national service the concept is predicated on the belief that young 
people can be motivated as much by altruism and civic obligation as 
by the prospect of material gain 
legislators envision a corps of up to one million high school 
graduates age 18 to 26 who would volunteer to spend one or two 
years performing community service such as working in hospitals 
aids hospices homeless shelters or child daycare centers 
they would be paid only subsistence wages about 100 a week but 
in exchange for their labors they would be given education vouchers 
worth 10000 for each year of national service 
the citizens corps would be a civilian gi bill of rights 
based on the sound premise of providing government benefits for 
service rendered to the country 
the idea dovetails nicely with george bushs call to invigorate 
a thousand points of light in american society and at the same 
time fosters a needed rebirth of american altruism

the arizona republic phoenix on soviet defense spending 
according to the soviet unions published budget the kremlins 
defense spending this year will amount to about 20 billion rubles 
at the official rate of exchange that is 10 billion or 60 
billion at the more realistic black market rate the united states 
defense budget approaches 300 billion 
thus moscows publicly declared defense budget is about onetenth 
of ours but the soviet union maintains an army of 180 active 
divisions compared with just 18 for the us 
writing in the current issue of janes soviet intelligence 
review james westwood notes that moscows defense budget seems 
small because it includes only boots gasoline tires and the like 
manpower costs and materials consumed in such operations as training 
exercises and administration 
unlike the pentagons the soviet budget omits weapons 
procurement maintenance and repair and research and development 
these military expenditures are integrated into the national 
budget and made invisible 
understanding this soviet peculiarity is important in trying to 
assess mikhail gorbachevs new defense policy reasonable 
sufficiency and his recent initiatives on troop and weapons 
reduction

students 
a student mob barricaded in the administration building of 
predominantly black howard university has succeeded in driving 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater from the schools 
board of trustees 
specifically the student protesters charged that president 
bushs willie horton campaign commercials on television were 
intended to appeal to the racist fears of white voters 
the racism allegation which was first injected into the 
presidential campaign by gov michael dukakis bushs democratic 
opponent ignores the fact that horton was never identified as black 
in the gop television commercials 
people quick to accuse others of racism have another favorite 
word for describing this affliction bigot 
its a term which aptly describes the view of the protesters who 
hounded atwater from the howard university board because he is a 
white republican appointed to serve a black university

stole a taxicab slashed the driver with a knife and led officers on

had worked for 2 years police say he instead went on the rampage 
 
president bush made much of the massachusetts early release

energy secretary james d watkins told congress 
today he doubted it would cost as much to clean up pollution at the 
nations nuclear weapons plants as the official estimates of between 
65 billion and 100 billion 
i believe we can do this for a lot less watkins told a 
senate budget subcommittee that is examining the energy departments 
plans for modernizing and correcting environmental problems at 16 
major weapons plants in 12 states 
watkins in his first congressional testimony since being sworn 
in last week said projections on the cleanup costs included a lot 
of gold watches or frills that the government could not afford at 
a time of tight budget limits 
i dont believe we need to buy all those gold watches 
watkins said in reference to his efforts to develop a comprehensive 
plan that would accomplish the cleanup at the least possible cost 
in part by letting some less harmful contaminants remain at the 
sites until sometime in the next century 
shortly before watkins took over the department had officially 
estimated it would cost 81 billion to clean up and modernize the 
weapons complex over the next 21 years and some department 
officials said recently that this figure may be too low the general 
accounting office the auditing agency of the congress has put the 
price tag at over 100 billion 
watkins said one of his immediate priorities was to reestablish 
the credibility of the energy department which has been strongly 
criticized by members of congress and government auditors for poor 
management of the weapons complex and lax oversight of safety 
procedures 
ill guarantee well get our act together watkins said he 
promised to present a more detailed plan for cleanup and 
modernization of the plants by summer 
because of the management and safety problems the countrys only 
nuclear reactors that produce tritium which is needed in the 
manufacture of nuclear warheads have been shut down for nearly a 
year 
the energy department has said these reactors must be restarted 
by the end of the year in order to avoid a squeeze on tritium 
supplies 
watkins said it was crucial that these reactors be restarted in 
order to assure tritium supplies that are vital to national security 
he rejected suggestions from some public interest groups that 
tritium production be suspended indefinitely in order to encourage 
an agreement with the soviet union on freezing production of nuclear 
weapons materials including plutonium 
we arent yet at a point in arms control where we can throw 
away our bargaining chips he said

leftist rebels today attacked 
army positions in the north and stepped up their campaign against 
sundays elections by threatening to kill election workers 
at least three soldiers and six guerrillas were killed police 
and army sources said 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
struck several garrisons and posts in the northernmost province of 
chalatenango army and rebel reports said 
the rebels clandestine radio venceremos said 13 soldiers were 
killed or wounded in the town of tejutla 30 miles north of san 
salvador 
the radio said guerrillas also hit the garrison in the provincial 
capital of chalatenango 28 miles northeast of the capital and army 
or civil defense posts in three other towns 
the radio did not immediately provide casualty figures 
col ciro lopez roque commander of the 4th infantry brigade 
said in a radio interview that the army had no precise figures but 
that there were quite a few casualties 
the armed forces press committee said three soldiers died and 
three were wounded in the fighting 
a police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity reached 
by telephone in chalatenango said the bodies of six guerrillas had 
been recovered the rebels also broadened an implicit threat made 
earlier this week 
the polling places will be sabotaged and those persons who lend 
themselves to this electoral game will later be killed because 
participation indicates agreement with escalation of the war said 
a rebel statement sent to radio stations 
the leftist farbundo marti national liberation front said earlier 
this week that election officials would be considered part of the 
counterinsurgency campaign the threats were similar to those that 
have been made against mayors 
nine mayors have been assassinated more than half the countrys 
262 mayors have resigned because of the threats

that what they want is to take power by force said president jose

opportunity to vote out an incumbent civilian administration and

today 
the emergency appeal was filed by inmate jonas h whitmore with 
justice harry blackmun who referred it to the full court 
spokeswoman kathy arberg said 
simmons scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 am thursday 
in arkansas first execution in 25 years has waived an appeal 
saying he wants to die 
whitmores attorney arthur allen said tuesday that if simmons 
sentence is carried out it will open the way to more executions in 
arkansas 
the state supreme court rejected whitmores petition monday 
ruling that whitmore lacked legal standing to address simmons 
rights 
state law gives simmons the right to an automatic appeal of his 
conviction and death sentence handed down last month for the 1987 
christmastime murders of 14 family members 
if simmons changes his mind at any point before the execution 
the process will be stopped said james lee spokesman for state 
attorney general steve clark 
simmons was arrested in 1987 in russellville after a shooting 
spree that left two people dead when police went to his rural home 
near dover they found the bodies of 14 of simmons relatives

president reagan approved a secret arrangement 
under which honduras got tens of millions of dollars in military aid 
in exchange for supporting the nicaraguan contra rebels former 
national security adviser robert mcfarlane testified today 
under questioning by defense lawyers at oliver norths 
irancontra trial mcfarlane detailed how reagan initialed a plan in 
midfebruary 1985 that resulted in honduras getting speededup 
deliveries of rifles ammunition and machine guns 
the matter was so sensitive mcfarlane acknowledged under 
questioning that the arrangement was discussed verbally with the 
honduran president and was not given to him in writing 
norths lawyers say the reagan administration had a policy of 
hiding its quid pro quo arrangements with other countries to support 
the contras during a twoyear congressional ban on us military aid 
to the rebels 
five of the 12 criminal charges against north a former white 
house aide are that he made false statements and obstructed 
congress in 1985 and 1986 with regard to his activities on behalf of 
the contras 
mcfarlane said reagan initialed a feb 18 1985 memo approving 
the secret arrangements with honduras the memo was signed by 
mcfarlane and had been prepared by north and another national 
security council staffer it was the culmination of discussions by 
cabinet officials in the administration 
mcfarlane agreed with defense attorney brendan sullivan that the 
extra aid to honduras was worth tens of millions of dollars 
sullivan mentioned during mcfarlanes testimony a feb 25 1985 
memo by the former national security adviser marked enhanced 
support for honduras in it mcfarlane stated we seem to be 
well on our way to release of 35 million 
after the quid pro quo arrangement went in effect mcfarlane said 
he got a memo from thendefense secretary caspar weinberger saying 
that expedited delivery of military equipment had begun 
the additional aid also included other unspecified assistance 
from an unidentified government agency 
at the time of the quid pro quo arrangements honduras was 
harboring many of the contras in camps along the countrys southern 
border and honduran officials feared troops of nicaraguas leftist 
government might attack them 
in april 1985 a honduran military official stopped a shipment of 
ammunition to the contras and mcfarlane in an april 25 1985 note 
urged reagan to telephone the honduran president and have him let 
the shipment go through the trial was told 
reagan sent back comments saying he had told the honduran 
president to deliver the ammunition reagan and the hondran 
president also discussed the fact that honduran officials were 
coming to the united states and would discuss about 15 million in 
aid for honduras when they met with thensecretary of state george 
shultz and weinberger 
mcfarlanes testimony followed a temporary halt in the trial this 
morning as norths lawyers tried to introduce classified material 
while crossexamining the former national security official 
the dispute erupted after sullivan while questioning mcfarlane 
tried to introduce a feb 11 1985 memo from north and another man 
to mcfarlane the memo relayed to members of the national security 
council concerned honduras and a buildup of contra forces 
us district judge gerhard gesell called lawyers to the bench 
saying with resignation i guess well have to do it this way 
after a few minutes he announced he would have to send the jury out 
of the courtroom the lawyers then argued over the matter behind 
closed doors 
gesell has said he wants to avoid a cuckooclock trial in 
which national security concerns trigger repeated delays in the 
proceedings 
the dispute came after gesell said he would decline to rule now 
on the question of whether classified material that norths lawyers 
want to introduce should be allowed into the case 
gesell said he will rule on a piecemeal basis in connection with 
the information norths attorneys want to present in crossexamining 
mcfarlane 
prosecutor john keker said sullivan has three books of material 
he wants to use in crossexamining mcfarlane which contain 
classified material keker said he wanted the judge to rule now on 
whether classifed material from those books should be presented in 
censored form or be allowed in an uncensored format 
gesell refused saying that would involve two or three days of

the vatican on wednesday carved up the 
archdiocese of sao paulo brazil the worlds largest into five 
separate church districts 
the move drastically reduces the domain of cardinal paulo 
evaristo arns considered a leader of the brazilian churchs 
progressive wing 
it shrinks sao paulo brazils commercial center from an 
archdiocese of 145 million people to 71 million people according 
to vatican figures 
the other 74 million people are now divided up into the newly 
created dioceses of campo limpo osasco santo amaro and sao miguel 
paulista 
some brazilians believe the action is part of a campaign by pope 
john paul ii to weaken the dominant progressive wing of the church 
in brazil and the powerful brazilian bishops conference 
the four new dioceses contain most of the churchrun community 
centers that often work with leftist political parties each will 
get its own bishop appointed by john paul

mushers in the 1168mile iditarod trail sled 
dog race charged along alaskas frozen west coast today in a tight 
race to the finish line in this historic gold rush town 
joe runyan 40 of nenana led a pack of five frontrunners in 
the anchoragetonome trek today when he left white mountain 77 
miles from the finish with a fiveminute lead over defending 
champion susan butcher 33 of manley 
butcher who has won the last three races was down to 11 dogs 
several with diarrhea while runyan was running 14 
race officials expected the winner to claim the 50000 
firstprize sometime around noon ast 4 pm est 
rick swenson the only musher ever to win the race four times 
arrived in white mountain an hour before runyan left and said he had 
given up hope of catching him my goal now is to get it over 
with swenson said 
dee dee jonrowe of willow and lavon barve of wasilla were fourth 
and fifth respectively 
fortyone of the 49 mushers who left anchorage on march 4 
remained in the race tuesday they use up to 18 dogs 
the annual race began 17 years ago and was inspired by a sleddog 
relay of serum to nome during a 1925 diphtheria outbreak butcher 
finished the 1988 race in just under 11 days and 12 hours to set a 
record 
as they awaited the finishers workers in nome moved snow onto 
historic front street normally swept clean for traffic the first 
musher to cross the finish line wins 50000 and 200000 is divided 
among the next 19 finishers 
the race whose trail is named for the gold mining ghost town of 
iditarod at the halfway point attracts dozens of volunteers from 
around the world 
i think author jack london put it best its the call of 
the wild iditarod volunteer peter elstub said its a true 
sporting event 
elstub a british army soldier has used his annual leave for 
eight years to work for the iditarod performing tasks ranging from 
telephone duty to dropping dog food along the trail when military 
duty kept him away in 1987 he telephoned iditarod headquarters for 
race updates 
it dont matter where i am in the world he said i still 
want me dog information 
unlike some years in which weather was a major factor in the 
outcome this years iditarod has been blessed with almost ideal 
conditions 
racers stop at 25 checkpoints along the route and are required to 
make two extended rest stops one for 24 hours the other for six 
hours 
commercial jets flying into nome operated near capacity tuesday 
as mushers families and other race watchers headed toward this town 
of 4300 people on alaskas west coast pilots pointed out stretches 
of the trail and encouraged passengers to keep their eyes open for 
sled teams 
nome which looks onto the frozen norton sound took on a party 
atmosphere helped by sunny skies and temperatures in the 20s singer 
hobo jim known for a song with the refrain i did i did i did 
the iditarod trail entertained customers at a front street saloon 
for the locals the iditarod days give people a reason to be 
outside and just walk around town and see what happened all winter 
long while they were holed up in their houses said mary knodel a 
shopkeeper whose store overlooks the finish line 
knodel said she doesnt root for individual mushers 
after watching the race for all these years you get to know 
most of them she said its like family you dont like picking 
one over another 
but marylou haggren of kodiak was rooting for butcher 
we just got back from the lower 48 and down there everyones 
talking basketball she said different lifestyles i guess

chief justice william h rehnquist warning of 
a serious threat to the future of the judiciary made a highly 
unusual personal appeal wednesday for a 30 percent increase in 
federal judges pay 
he urged congress which has rejected a 51 percent pay hike 
proposed for itself federal judges and highranking government 
officials to give special consideration to the judiciary 
rehnquist told a rare news conference judges ought not to be 
in it for the money theyd have to be out of their minds 
but he continued unlike many other positions judging 
requires that you be a lawyer many people feel lawyers make too 
much money but thats a fact of life so far as recruiting federal 
judges is concerned 
were not saying offer them the same they would make in private 
practice were saying offer them enough so theyll be able to 
educate their kids 
rehnquist proposed increasing annual salaries for federal trial 
judges from 89500 now to 116350 and from 95000 to 123000 
for appeals court judges the plan would hike the chief justices 
yearly pay from 115000 to 149500 and raise the salary of other 
high court justices from 110000 to 143000 
the pay raise proposal was adopted tuesday by the us judicial 
conference the policymaking arm of the federal judiciary presided 
over by rehnquist 
congress was responding to a public outcry last month when it 
rejected the proposed 51 percent pay raise recommended by a 
presidential commission supporters of higher pay for judges hope 
singling out the judiciary for bigger salaries will ease 
congressional fears of retaliation by the voters 
failure to adequately address this issue poses the most serious 
threat to the future of the judiciary and its continued operations 
that i have observed rehnquist said 
he said many federal judges may leave the bench for more 
lucrative private practice if no relief is provided noting that 
some young judicial law clerks make more money than judges as soon 
as the clerks begin private practice 
the problem is particularly acute in big cities where recruiting 
qualified judges is becoming more difficult rehnquist said 
without redress the federal judiciary as we know it cannot 
continue to meet the high standards the public has come to expect 
from it he said 
rehnquist noted that appointment to the federal bench is intended 
to be for a lifetime to insulate judges from political pressures 
by contrast he said that state judges in his home state of 
arizona frequently used a judicial appointment as a steppingstone to 
career advancement 
a lifetime appointment gives you a different kind of judge 
someone simply devoted to judging rather than looking out of the 
corner of your eye for the next political opportunity that comes 
along rehnquist said 
the us judicial conference said the number of judges resigning 
to return to private practice is increasing it said 57 federal 
judges have resigned since 1974 compared with six in the 16 
preceding years 
there are some 540 federal trial judges and 150 appeals court 
judges

upper great lakes region as a cold front to the south unleashed 
fierce thunderstorms and dust storms turned skies a butterscotch 
color in the central plains 
the weather was blamed for six traffic deaths three in 
minnesota two in kansas and one in indiana 
the snowstorm came from a deep low pressure system that developed

the gogebic county sheriffs department in the upper peninsula 
people around here are pretty resolved we have to deal with this 
kind of snowfall in the winter 
in minneapolisst paul a snowfall of 7 inches tuesday forced 
the airport to close for three hours the first closing this season 
we had 2 to 3 to 4 inches coming down an hour which is about 
as bad as it gets here said george condon of the metropolitan 
airports commission 
even snow removal crews were taken off the runways we pulled 
everybody off the field because the visibility was so bad condon 
said 
thunderstorms ahead of a cold front produced large hail and 
damaging winds in illinois indiana and michigan at detroit 
metropolitan airport gusts up to 58 mph were reported tuesday night 
earlier tuesday strong winds circulating around the powerful low

high winds hammered eastern colorado gusts of up to 120 mph 
northwest of loveland knocked down trees and utility poles a dozen 
ski lifts in colorados summit county west of denver were 
temporarily shut down by the wind 
the storm crossed into oklahoma from kansas and hit tulsa during 
the afternoon rush hour turning the sky a butterscotch color larry 
ruthi a national weather service forecaster said it was oklahomas 
worst dust storm in five years 
this is almost entirely kansas dirt its brown not red he 
said 
in kansas windblown dust piled up against fences like snow 
drifts said sheriff ron achilles of gove county 
officials reported scores of traffic accidents statewide 
including two fatal ones as the dust storm made the noon sky look 
like twilight firefighters battled scattered grass fires and many 
highways closed because of poor visibility 
interstate 70 was closed from hays to the colorado border a 
distance of 160 miles from late morning through most of the 
afternoon because of poor visibility and the need to clear traffic 
accidents from the road said lt jerry dietz of the kansas highway 
patrol 
hill city kan had a gust at 72 mph around noon 
the high winds and blowing dust combined to shut down kansas city 
international airport for about 90 minutes at the height of the 
storm 
if you can imagine a handful of dirt in your eyes that was 
it said kansas highway patrol trooper douglas griffiths in 
norton thats not an exaggeration

a civilian judge today indicted 
and jailed two army officers accusing them of a role in the 
massacre of 10 peasant farmers 
it was the first time that armed forces officers had been 
indicted for killing civilians in nine years of civil war during 
which the armed forces have been accused of thousands of slaying 
judge alcides guandique also indicted seven soldiers for their 
alleged role in the killings guandique 33 handed down the 
indictments in his office in san sebastian 30 miles east of san 
salvador 
the united states which provides most of the salvadoran 
governments funds has lobbied for a credible investigation into 
the slayings and punishment for those responsible 
maj mauricio beltran granados and 2nd lt arnaldo vasquez 
alvarenga were jailed pending their trials which were likely to 
begin in several weeks guandique said 
the indictments came only four days before the march 19 
presidential election in which salvadorans for the first time will 
have the chance to eject an incumbent civilian government in favor 
of another party 
the slayings occurred last sept 21 when troops used explosives 
and rifle fire to kill 10 people in the hamlet of san francisco 
four miles north of san salvador according to the indictments 
other villagers said the 10 were accused by the soldiers of 
collaborating with leftist guerrillas waging a 9yearold war 
against the usbacked government 
the armed forces on sunday in an unprecedented step admitted 
responsibility for the massacre and submitted those implicated to 
civilian jurisdiction 
with guandiques indictment and decree of provisional detention 
the officers became the first in salvadoran history to be jailed on 
the order of a civilian judge 
the army originally said the ten peasants had died in fierce 
combat then said they had been killed in a guerrilla ambush that 
injured nobody else 
guandique has won praise from human rights advocates for his 
persistent investigation of the case 
about 70000 people have died during the civil war between the 
leftist farabundo marti national liberation front most of them 
civilians

the bush administration today unveiled 
longpromised legislation setting up a system of tax credits to help 
lowincome parents make childcare arrangements 
president bushs proposal outlined by press secretary marlin 
fitzwater after bush briefed several members of congress in the 
cabinet room would provide a tax credit of up to 1000 for each 
child under age 4 in lowincome working families he said 25 
million american families would initially benefit from the 
legislation 
families would be free to choose the kind of child care that 
best suits their needs fitzwater told reporters during the daily 
news briefing 
bush pledged during his presidential campaign that he would seek 
to assist lowincome families in which at least one parent works 
by using the tax code to help defray the cost of childcare 
the legislation was being introduced on capitol hill by senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas 
the important aspect of this program is that it encourages 
child care development fitzwater said it offers parents a 
choice that dont now have a choice members of the poor who 
cannot afford whatever programs are in their area 
this offers federal assistance for parents that might want to 
use relatives for child care he added saying that it gets at 
the problem from the standpoint of providing child care for those 
who do not currently have it available 
under the bill bush seeks which will have to compete with 
democraticsponsored legislation the tax credit would be provided 
to families with incomes ranging from 8000 to 13000 a year in 
the 1990 tax year 
for each child under the age of 4 families would receive a 
credit equal to 14 percent of wages with a maximum credit equal to 
1000 per child 
the major democratic bill is the 25 billion act for better 
child care services most of the money would be for direct 
assistance to lowincome families the rest would go to improve 
quality expand supply and set up an insurance risk pool states 
would have to comply with minimum health and safety standards about 
five years after enactment 
fitzwater noted that the childcare tax credit proposal was one 
of bushs campaign pledges and said that it was the substance or 
the basis of his meeting this morning with members of congress who 
are interested in this proposal 
our purpose here is to provide care where none exists 
the spokesman said to provide maximum choice to families our 
belief is that parents can decide best how to take care of their 
children so this maximizes options and it does not eliminate the 
more formal daycare centers and childcare centers 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn talking to reporters in the white 
house driveway following the meeting with bush said he thought the 
president was moving in the right direction 
the president is not using this program to set up a huge 
bureaucracy boschwitz said hes allowing the working poor with 
children to go back to work 
under existing law parents are allowed a 720 credit for child 
care costs incurred in order to accept or keep employment but it 
applies only to families with sufficient income to pay federal 
income taxes

members of the senate armed services committee 
said today they were wrapping up loose ends on the nomination of 
rep dick cheney as defense secretary and hinted that a vote on the 
selection could come soon 
sen john mccain rariz said the committee did not want to act 
with unseemly haste but indicated that a decision on the 
wyoming republican could come as early as today 
however sen william cohen rmaine said he did not expect a 
committee vote until thursday 
the committee met in closed session with cheney this morning to 
discuss his financial records and other background questions 
congressional aides said 
mccain said the panel also was taking care of loose ends 
reviewing reports on the nominee from the white house he did not 
specify whether the information included the fbi background check of 
cheney chosen by prewsident bush for the pentagon post after the 
senate rejected his first nominee john tower 
on the opening day of hearings tuesday cheney submitted a letter 
from his cardiologist dr allan m ross of the george washington 
university medical center stating that the nominee is fit to 
accept any position requiring the highest intellectual behavior and 
physical performance 
cheney has suffered three heart attacks and underwent coronary 
bypass surgery last year 
senators saw no roadblocks to confirmation of cheney as they 
tried to put ill feelings from the rancorous partisan debate over 
the tower nomination behind them bush announced the selection of 
cheney on friday one day after the senate defeated the nomination 
of tower a former texas senator 5347 
members of the armed services panel suggested tuesday that the 
confirmation process could be wrapped up by weeks end when the 
senate breaks for a twoweek recess 
im delighted with this nomination said sen james exon of 
nebraska secondranking democrat on the panel i hope this 
confirmation goes quickly and i believe it will 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman said the panel 
would not be taking any shortcuts on the nomination saying it 
was still awaiting letters from white house and pentagon counsels on 
cheneys financial record and the fbi background check 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater asked when the fbi 
checks on cheney would be finished said theyre trying to move 
those as rapidly as possible i dont have a specific date 
cheney spent the opening day of hearings expounding on his views 
of defense policy as committee members praised the nominee gave him 
high marks for his answers and left little doubt about the final 
outcome on the nomination 
i thank the president for sending your nomination to us said 
sen alan dixon dill 
on a series of defense and foreign policy issues cheney 
cautioned against any us reductions in military strength in 
response to changes in the soviet union 
it would be a great mistake to reduce our own military 
capabilities and lessen our defense posture cheney said 
questioned by sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on 
the committee cheney said he was once skeptical of the changes in 
the soviet union by president mikhail s gorbachev but that he now 
believes the soviets are sincere in seeking arms controls 
on other issues cheney said 
he has been a strong supporter of the strategic defense 
initiative commonly known as star wars the pentagon is conducting 
a strategic and budget review that will have a major impact on star 
wars funding asked about the level of funding cheney said 
thats an open question 
the united states should encourage japan and western europe to 
spend more money on defense but the us argument should be that 
the additional funding is required for our common defense 
donald atwood has agreed to accept his nomination as deputy 
secretary of defense atwood had been chosen by bush when tower was 
nominated 
he supports a defense budget that would be approved for a 
twoyear period instead of one year at a time as is customary an 
argument pentagon officials say will build stability into the 
weaponsbuying process 
in introducing cheney sen malcolm wallop rwyo a member of 
the armed services panel said cheneys sense of humility and a 
sense of presence served him well and will serve america well 
house republican leader bob michel said he recommended the 
nomination with a combination of pride and regret because he was

a copkiller whose 1985 grant of clemency 
from gov mario cuomo was denounced by thenvice president george 
bush was granted parole today 
gary mcgivern who was convicted of murder in the 1968 shooting 
of a deputy sheriff could be free by the end of the week once the 
paperwork is done officials said 
the decision followed an appearance by mcgivern before a 
threemember board of parole panel at the mediumsecurity prison 
where he is serving a life sentence 
it was mcgiverns third such appearance since cuomos new years 
eve 1985 clemency that was attacked by bush and many new york law 
enforcement officials twice mcgivern was turned down because of the 
nature of the crime 
edward elwin executive director of the board of parole said the 
penal cited mcgiverns outstanding record in prison in voting 
30 to release him under intense supervision 
cuomo as lieutenant governor recommended clemency in 1979 after 
mcgivern passed two lie detector tests but thengov hugh carey 
said no six years later cuomo granted clemency making mcgivern 
eligible for an immediate parole hearing 
it was a very difficult call said cuomo this man is not a 
cop killer 
for a time mcgivern was on death row but an appeals court kept 
him from going to the chair 
corrections department spokesman james flateau said mcgivern was 
refusing to grant interviews 
in the past the very idea that mcgivern was even getting a 
parole hearing brought out placardcarrying prison guards and law 
enforcement officials that was true again this week as members of 
the state sheriffs association protested outside parole board 
offices in albany on tuesday 
mcgivern hasnt learned anything except how to work the system 
the people who will learn something from mcgiverns early release 
are the potential cop killers peter kehoe executive director of 
the sheriffs group said in a statement 
theyll learn that its okay to kill a cop today society 
wont care about the dead cop in a few years 
on wednesday there were no demonstrators at the parole boards 
albany office or outside the otisville prison 
kavanagh has said mcgiverns parole may boost efforts to override 
a cuomo veto of legislation restoring the death penalty the states 
electric chair hasnt been used since 1963 and cuomo has vetoed 
death penalty legislation for the past six years 
a reasonable ruleabiding inmate said state corrections 
commissioner thomas coughlin last week when asked about mcgivern 
i think if gary mcgivern was paroled tomorrow he would probably 
never get in trouble again 
after three trials mcgivern and fellow inmate charles culhane 
received life sentences for the shooting death of william 
fitzgerald a westchester county deputy during an attempt to escape 
while being transported to court 
mcgivern and culhane have blamed a third inmate robert bowerman 
for the slaying bowerman died of gunshot wounds in the escape 
attempt 
culhane said todays decision should help his own bid for early 
release cuomo has refused to grant culhane clemency and hes not 
eligible for a parole hearing until 1991 
mcgivern and culhanes first trial ended in a hung jury their 
conviction in a second trial was overturned on appeal a third trial 
ended in conviction in 1975

american journalist terry a anderson 
longestheld of the 15 western hostages in lebanon begins his fifth 
year of captivity thursday with no sign that he will be freed soon 
in the last message his captors allowed him to send a brief 
videotape oct 31 four days after his 41st birthday anderson said 
i find it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was returing home from a tennis game march 16 1985 when 
gunmen seized him in moslem west beirut 
his captors belong to islamic jihad a proiranian shiite moslem 
group whose name means islamic holy war it is believed to be part 
of the fundamentalist shiite militia hezbollah or party of god 
islamic jihad also holds thomas sutherland 57 an american born 
in scotland who was acting dean of agriculture at the american 
university of beirut when he was abducted june 9 1985 
shiites also hold most of the other western hostages seven 
americans three britons an italian a belgian and an irishman 
among them is church of england envoy terry waite 48 he dropped 
from sight jan 20 1987 after leaving his west beirut hotel to 
negotiate with islamic jihad on behalf of anderson and sutherland 
released 
six organizations of western journalists observed andersons 
anniversary by asking the worlds media to disseminate a 
solidarity with anderson statement they issued 
it urges president bush and his administration to use every 
possible means at their disposal to bring terry anderson and other 
hostages home 
the international press institute said we appeal to 
governments throughout the free world to continue with their efforts 
to obtain mr andersons release 
some hope had arisen that socalled pragmatists in iran would 
help free the captives it was crushed by the new revolutionary 
radicalism accompanying ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis order that his 
followers kill salman rushdie as a blasphemer of islam for writing 
the satanic verses 
the doors have been slammed shut again said the rev 
lawrence jenco an american roman catholic priest kidnapped by 
islamic jihad on jan 8 1985 
he shared a cell with anderson for several months and was freed 
july 26 1986 one of three american hostages released in president 
ronald reagans armsforhostages deal with iran 
andersons sister peggy say who leads the campaign for his 
release said the situation has fallen apart again because of 
the furor over rushdie 
islamic jihad has demanded that kuwait free proiranian 
extremists convicted for the december 1983 bombings of the us and 
french embassies in the persian gulf emirate 
kuwait refused two of the 17 bombers were released earlier this 
year after serving their fiveyear sentences but they were not 
considered key figures 
one of the men islamic jihad wants most is believed to be 
mustapha youssef badreddin a cousin and brotherinlaw of imad 
mugniyeh lebanese and western intelligence agencies say mugniyeh is 
islamic jihads leader and a senior figure in hezbollah 
badreddin and two other bombers were sentenced to death but have 
not been executed 
among those serving life sentences is hassan youssed musawi a 
cousin of hussein musawi who leads another proiranian shiite 
faction in lebanon 
most of the western hostages are believed held in underground 
cells in beiruts teeming southern slums a shiite stronghold 
the last communication from andersons captors was a blurred 
instant photograph of him with a cake released nov 4 eight days 
after his 41st birthday 
an accompanying statement accused the reagan administration of 
avoiding steps that would free the hostages and said the 
journalists release could be achieved only by the implementation 
of our just demands 
anderson has never seen his 3yearold daughter sulome born 
three months after his abduction her mother madeleine who is 
lebanese and lives in cyprus sent a letter to beirut newspapers in 
the hope his captors would let him read it 
i would like to wake up and find you by my side ready for 
another day together but i know this is not going to happen at this 
moment and today is four years since we last saw each other she 
wrote 
i should be heartbroken sad and depressed today i am not 
that at all because whats gone is only days of the many years 
that await us and our daughter is a constant reminder of that 
she is everything i know you want her to be she needs you we 
both need you very much our need is becoming the source of our 
strength and patience tragedy has struck andersons family since 
he was kidnapped but fellow hostages who have been freed say he 
does not know it 
his father glenn r anderson died of cancer on feb 15 1986 
at age 69 his elder brother glenn richard jr died of cancer on 
june 7 of that year aged 46 four days after making a videotape on 
which he pleaded with islamic jihad from his sickbed to free terry 
anderson probably is unaware of one other death ali ayub who 
sources say led the kidnap gang was killed in a beirut shootout 
with rival militiamen later in 1985

the administration while banning imports of 
semiautomatic assault weapons pending review of their usage sees no 
need for similar review of domestically produced weapons the white 
house said today 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said president bush is not 
willing to expand the ban and review the administration announced 
tuesday to block import of semiautomatics that are not for sporting 
use 
at this point we are not willing to extend that fitzwater 
told reporters although some of the assault weapons produced and 
sold in the united states are virtually identical to the imports 
the spokesman said no curtailment of their manufacture is currently 
envisioned 
we dont see any need for any review or any other changes at 
all he said however he did not preclude eventually expanding the 
review 
were saying heres an issue thats come to light we need to 
deal with it and well see where we go he said 
administration officials describe the ban on imports of ak47s 
and other semiautomatic firearms as temporary and reversible 
but they say it was necessary to head off an imminent flood of the 
assault weapons into the united states 
the action tuesday appeared to be a softening of bushs 
oftstated opposition to gun controls but fitzwater said it merely 
enforces current law that allows imports of guns only if for 
sporting purposes 
bush a member of the national rifle association shares the 
public concern over the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons 
but he is not changing his position against a ban on such guns 
fitzwater said 
vice president dan quayle told the associated press today that he 
had received several inquiries from people who were concerned 
about the administration action 
quayle declined to elaborate but he said bush was absolutely 
right to enforce the existing regulations we have i see it as a 
serious attempt by president bush to review the situation 
bush had asked national drug control director william j bennett 
last week to recommend what should be done about the weapons calls 
for a ban have been prompted by scores of drugrelated shootings and 
the recent killing of five california schoolchildren 
the action will affect more than 110000 weapons with pending 
applications for import bennett said including akstype firearms 
such as ak47s uzi carbines fnfal and fnfnctype weapons as well 
as steyr aug semiautomatic weapons 
it does not affect semiautomatic weapons already in this country 
or those produced domestically such as the ar15 the civilian 
version of the militarys 223caliber m16 
the decision to suspend imports was made a day after bennett was 
sworn in to his new job stephen e higgins director of the 
treasury departments bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms had 
raised the issue with bennett 
higgins mentioned to him this spike this upsurge in import 
applications and outlined for bennett what the legal authorities 
and options were said bennett spokesman don hamilton 
atf approved the import of 88000 such weapons during 1986 1987 
and 1988 this year alone the government has received requests to 
import many more than that with 113732 applications pending 
according to bennett 
after several more conversations with higgins and others his 
thinking was developing along the lines of this was a temporary and 
reversible measure hamilton said 
if we keep them out its temporary and reversible he said 
if on the other hand you let them in theyre in and its 
irreversible in the space of several weeks you could more than 
double the last three years imports by doing nothing 
treasury secretary nicholas brady whose department includes atf 
agreed to the import suspension and ordered it tuesday 
atf has the authority to regulate the importation of weapons 
into the united states to make sure they fall into certain 
categories spokesman dick pedersen said were saying some of 
these weapons may not fall into some of the prescribed categories 
such as hunting 
gun control advocates hailed the move while even the nra which 
has opposed controls on the weapons said it could do some good 
the action would put a stop to the media hysteria surrounding 
the semiautomatic version of the ak47 rifle and should provide an 
atmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this issue said 
wayne lapierre executive director of the nra institute for 
legislative action 
before the suspension announcement nra president joe foss 
decried the panic over semiautomatic weapons and blamed a faulty 
criminal justice system for the current state of affairs in which 
heavily armed drug dealers operate within minutes of the white house 
if you think that taking away the guns from those bozos will 
make any difference youve got another thing coming foss said 
you could outlaw every single gun that there is and they would 
still get them 
handgun control spokeswoman susan whitmore called the decision a 
first step toward public safety 
its really significant that theres general recognition of the 
problem that these combat weapons pose to the safety of not only the 
nations law enforcement community but to the citizens all across 
the country she said 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio who has introduced legislation 
that would ban new assault weapons and require registration of those 
already in circulation said the import ban is a major first 
step 
but currently nothing prevents the manufacture of these 
weapons here in the united states metzenbaum said it is 
necessary that we ban the sale of new assault weapons and register 
the ones already in circulation 
the move came a day after the california state assembly passed a 
ban on 40 types of semiautomatics the state senate had passed a 
similar bill earlier

egypt took control of the red sea resort of 
taba from israel on wednesday amid shouts of joy from egyptians and 
cries of protest from israeli hotel workers who burned tires on a 
nearby hillside 
some of the 200 egyptian workers sightseers and border policemen 
shouted allahu akbar or god is great as the black white 
and red flag of egypt was raised over taba many joined in singing 
the egyptian national anthem my country my country 
israeli hotel workers protested the transfer setting tires set 
ablaze on a nearby hill they said they had no assurances about 
employment under the egyptians 
the handover came hours after a raid by two palestinian 
guerrillas who sneaked across the egyptian border and hurled a hand 
grenade at an israeli army post in the occupied gaza strip before 
being wounded and captured no israeli soldiers were hurt 
also wednesday jewish settlers accompanied by tractors and 
mobile homes built a new settlement in the occupied west bank and 
one settler leader said the construction was a response in part to 
israels withdrawal from taba 
the raid and settlement construction appeared to be attempts by 
both jewish and palestinian extremists to mar the transfer which 
ended seven years of bitter squabblng between israel and egypt 
minutes after israel handed over the 250acre strip of beach 
egyptian immigration officials set up tents at the new border marker 
to handle traffic 
egyptian workers put finishing touches on a new border gate and 
immigration building which were to be finished by sunday when 
president hosni mubarak will attend a more festive flagraising 
celebration 
mubarak in bonn on wednesday was asked by israel radio if he 
had a message for israelis regarding taba he said peace and 
peace it is so important to human beings so important to the 
israelis and to the arabs and to human beings all over the world it 
is worth whatever concession so we should be much more flexible 
with each other so that each country can reach a lasting settlement 
forever 
israel had retained control of taba when it pulled out of the 
rest of the sinai in 1982 under the egyptianisraeli peace treaty of 
1979 
an international arbitration panel awarded taba to egypt in 
september and in february egypt and israel signed agreements that 
include 37 million in compensation for the israeli owner of tabas 
main hotel the sonesta 
an israeli official said no parallels should be drawn between the 
return of taba and calls for israel to withdraw from the west bank 
and gaza strip captured in the 1967 middle east war 
here it is obvious said yitzhak lior deputy director 
general of the israeli foreign ministry we had a bone of 
contention with a country with which we have peace there it is 
different 
ahmed masery egypts consul general in eilat told israel radio 
the transfer should lead to better relations i hope this will be 
a bridge to peace peace between the two peoples he said 
on tuesday night the israelis took down their blue and white 
flag and did not raise it again before the handover wednesday 
apparently to avoid a simultaneous lowering and raising of flags 
as egyptian police and troops carrying rifles entered the resort 
in groups of three dozens of israeli buses police vehicles and 
cars drove out of taba along with about 50 protesting hotel workers 
who sang israels national anthem hatikva or hope 
israeli workers at tabas 326room sonesta hotel chanted in 
protest shortly before the transfer several were arrested 
elan ester hazy a leader of the hotel union said we have 
nothing against the egyptian government on the contrary it is 
their right ill be ready to work with the egyptians but under 
proper terms 
egyptians were jubilant running up the rocky hills overlooking 
the red sea and roaming curiously around the hotel grounds some 
bought souvenirs in the hotel shop which began accepting egyptian 
currency wednesday 
we came from nueiba just to watch said mervat elqassar who 
drove 40 miles from her home town with her family 
at the border a huge sign saying welcome in english and 
arabic hung outside the egyptian immigration tent

moslem militias fought intermittent battles with automatic rifles 
and howitzers in beirut and southeast of the capital on wednesday 
a police spokesman said 43 people have been killed and 129 
wounded since early tuesday when fierce fighting broke out in and 
around beirut 
the fatalities included seven syrian soldiers and four soldiers 
from gen michel aouns 20000strong regular christian force said 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing rules 
the latest fatalities raised to 49 dead and 161 wounded the 
overall toll since march 8 when clashes began the fighting is the 
worst since 1985 in the 14yearold civil war between moslems and 
christians 
the clashes began after aoun imposed a blockade on illegal ports 
two moslem militias use to import arms and supplies and to generate 
revenue they in turn shelled legal ports run by aouns units and 
bombarded christian districts 
aoun who also heads the christian cabinet in lebanons dual 
government said tuesday his troops were fighting a war of 
liberation against syrian occupation forces that will continue 
until all syrian troops left lebanon 
he blamed the shelling on the syrians and said they pounded both 
the moslems and christians 
the syrians with 40000 troops deployed in mostly moslem sectors 
of the country are lebanons main power brokers they support the 
moslem cabinet of acting prime minister salim hoss 
hoss a sunni moslem blamed the barrage on aoun and accused him 
of committing unspecified massacres hoss in a memorandum asked 
the arab league to dispatch a committee to investigate the 
horrible massacre 
police said christian army units and moslem militias sporadically 
exchanged automatic rifle fire across beiruts dividing green line

sen daniel k inouye on wednesday reintroduced 
a fairness doctrine bill for broadcasters and then listened to 
experts debate whether it is necessary in this diverse media age to 
make stations air all sides of controversial issues 
the senate bill with a halfdozen cosponsors matched 
legislation already introduced in the house that would write into 
law the federal communications commissions 40yearold rules that 
the fcc repealed in 1987 
the bill is expected to pass easily again this year as it did 
last year and then face another presidential veto 
inouye a democrat from hawaii who is chairman of the senate 
commerce science and transportation committees communications 
subcommittee said the need for the bill was greater than ever he 
cited a recent article in broadcasting magazine that concluded 
that in the last year there has been a decrease in the amount of 
time devoted to broadcast station editorials 
but sen bob packwood rore the top gop member of the 
subcommittee said arguments for the fairness doctrine get weaker 
and weaker 
packwood said the doctrine first was promulgated in the 1940s on 
the idea that the radio and television spectrum was limited 
there were certainly fewer broadcasters than there are now 
no cable no videocassette recorders today we have such a plethora 
of access to information that one is hardpressed to say that if 
every radio station in the country every television station in the 
country is not compelled by law to follow a content doctrine where 
we impose the content that somehow the public is not going to be 
wellinformed 
but sen john danforth rmo said the number of outlets was not 
the issue it was the number of people a single outlet can reach in 
an era in which according to polls he cited americans watch an 
average of four hours of tv daily and half the public gets all of 
its news from television 
i think that the broadcast medium has a unique role in its 
ability to affect the thinking of the american people thats simply 
not shared by the print media danforth said 
but one witness before the panel thomas g krattenmaker of the 
georgetown university law center said the doctrine was misguided 
regulatory policy that tries to make every station behave in a 
perfect way to provide news and information for everyone who might 
want that type of news or information in that listening market 
thats like telling a shoe store that it must provide every 
kind of shoe that anybody might want to buy krattenmaker said 
jerome baron of the george washington university national law 
center disagreed saying the age of diverse media outlets has not 
arrived and that cable is an unequal rival to broadcasting 
cable is now in its early adolescence baron said if we 
measure the contribution of cable from what it has in its own voice 
been able to say i dont think its said very much 
im skeptical about claims that these new media will greatly 
diminish the importance and power of the established prestige 
media he said 
scott denman of the safe energy communication council questioned 
claims that the fairness doctrine chilled discussion of 
controversial issues he said his groups surveys had found the 
doctrine actually encourages more and never less coverage of the 
issues especially news 
but he said very few broadcasters will actively seek opposing 
points of view when it involves paid political advertising 
professor anna goldoff of the city university of new york said 
her survey of 22 new york city radio and tv stations found that just 
two of them considered the doctrine to have a chilling effect while 
82 percent said it had no effect one way or another 
sen john mccain rariz challenged that view 
i know of several cases where the chilling effect was clearly 
evident in a political race that i was in and several others 
mccain said noting that small radio stations facing large 
attorneys fees to defend themselves just opt out 
they just play music and that solves their problem and 
therefore the people within broadcast range of them dont receive 
information on controversial issues mccain said

secretary of state james a baker iii 
clarifying an earlier statement said today the possibility of an 
israeliplo dialogue should not be categorically ruled out 
because it might some day make a contribution to peace 
elaborating on remarks he made tuesday baker indicated in 
testimony to the senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations that he felt the prospects for such a dialogue were 
remote 
under questioning from sen arlen specter rpa baker said he 
only meant to say in his earlier remarks that such a dialogue should 
not be categorically absolutely totally and completely ruled 
out because it might help the peace process 
in testimony tuesday before a house subcommittee baker said it 
may some day be necessary for israel to talk to the plo to settle 
the palestinian problem leaving the impression among some that us 
policy on that issue might be shifting 
he told the house panel the overall us aim is direct and 
meaningful negotiations 
now he said if you cant have direct negotiations that 
are meaningful that do not involve negotiations with the plo i 
suppose we would then have to see negotiations between israelis and 
representatives of the plo 
baker testifying today before the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations clarified his earlier remarks by 
suggesting that an israeliplo dialogue was little more than a 
hypothetical possibility 
the subject is touchy israel refuses to deal with the plo 
holding it responsible for bloody terrorist attacks on civilians 
diplomats and soldiers 
in israel maj gen yitzhak mordechai head of israels southern 
command said plo chairman yasser arafat was aware of a ring of arab 
guerrillas that crossed the egyptian border today and attacked an 
israeli military outpost in the occupied gaza strip with rifles and 
hand grenades two teenage fighters were wounded and captured 
foreign minister moshe arens who is holding talks here accused 
the plo on tuesday of committing the worst atrocities weve ever 
seen since world war ii he said the dialogue the united states 
opened last december with yasser arafats organization had 
strengthened the plos hand 
but baker testified it may be that you can have meaningful 
negotiations that do not involve the plo it may be that you cant 
our policy is simply that we think there needs to be direct 
negotiations which are meaningful between israelis and 
palestinians 
bakers statement appeared to mark another turn in an evolving 
us policy toward the plo after several unsuccessful efforts to 
meet with palestinians not identified with arafats group the 
reagan administration last december dropped a 13year ban on talking 
to the plo 
it acted after arafat made public statements urged on him by the 
state department renouncing terrorism and accepting israels right 
to exist 
the bush administration which took office jan 20 continued the 
dialogue despite several raids by plo guerrillas against israelis in 
southern lebanon and last week approved visas for plo officials to 
participate in a mideast conference in new york 
this week baker has put increasing emphasis on a need for 
israeli talks with palestinians and in his testimony said the 
sessions might have to be held with the plo in order to be 
meaningful 
arens at a news conference in a downtown hotel declined to 
comment on bakers statement saying he had not heard it directly 
but he again ruled out any israeli government talks with the plo 
which he accused of murdering israelis and palestinians and 
threatening the regime of king hussein of jordan 
arens said the dialogue begun by the united states in december 
gave the plo a sense of legitimacy and strengthens an 
organization that is actively engaged in terrorism 
arens said he did not urge a suspension of the talks in his 
meetings on monday with president bush and baker and he said bush 
and baker did not ask israel to deal with the plo 
but the visiting israeli official criticized the us opening to 
the plo that dialogue gives them a sense of legitimacy he 
said arens said terrorist acts by the plo had increased since the 
us talks opened 
giving them an image of being strengthened by recognition is 
counterproductive the israeli foreign minister said 
arens said the united states and israel should focus their 
peacemaking drive on hussein and provide him with incentives to 
negotiate over the future of the west bank and gaza the 
predominantly arab territories israel has held since the 1967 
sixday war 
he called jordan and palestinian residents the legitimate 
interlocutors with israel and pledged that we in israel will 
make every effort to move the peace process forward we do not need 
any urging

cartoonist berke breathed has poked fun at 
crayola crayons once again but the crayon maker says things arent 
as black and white as they appear in bloom county 
in january breathed drew a strip in which a black child wanting 
to draw a selfportrait contemplated a crayon whose color was 
labeled flesh 
but binney amp smith inc makers of the crayons sent a letter to 
breathed noting that it had changed the label from flesh to 
peach in 1963 partially as a result of the civil rights 
movement 
in strips appearing in tuesdays newspapers breathed 
acknowledged the error but targeted another color still used 
indian red 
in the latest episode the cartoons fictional chief executive 
officer wa thornhump says the company was accidentally 
mentioned here as selling racially insensitive pink crayons labeled 
flesh he continues it was a grave and foolish mistake crayola 
hasnt had flesh since 1963 
then another character the penguin opus notes it does have 
indian red tho 
crayola does have an indian red binney amp smith spokesman 
brad drexler said tuesday but it does not refer to anyones skin 
color 
it was used to describe the ground early american indians used 
in various projects he said citing pottery 
websters third new international dictionary defines indian red 
as a yellowish red ferruginous earth containing hematite and used 
as a pigment its spelled with a lowercase i by both 
websters and binney amp smith 
drexler shrugged off breatheds latest barb saying i guess 
hes trying to get the last word in on the crayola story 
ironically it was binney amp smith that provided breathed with his 
latest ammunition

which syndicates bloom county said breathed found the indian 
red crayon in a shipment of crayons the forks township company 
sent to prove it no longer used flesh on its crayons

poles lined up in droves at the new 
foreignexchange window of a downtown bank wednesday the first day 
they could legally buy dollars with their zlotys 
instead of the official exchange rate of 570 zlotys to the 
dollar the stateowned pko bank was offering dollars at a free 
market rate of 3000 zlotys 
none of the customers seemed to mind they were happy to have the 
greenbacks at any price 
until now they were banned by law from buying dollars with their 
zlotys and had to avail themselves of the ubiquitous black market 
the bank also was selling zlotys at a rate of 2900 for 1 a 
boon for those poles who earn hard currency abroad or who provide 
goods or services for hard currency that window was less frenzied 
however 
no personal identification was required at the bank and no 
questions were asked about where their money came from 
demand for dollars is strong in poland because the best material 
goods ranging from houses and cars to imported electronics 
equipment and infant formula usually are available only for dollars 
or other hard currency 
poles who travel to the west also need hard currency to spend 
since the zloty cannot be traded abroad 
the staterun news agency said the new foreign currency law is 
intended to end the legal fiction of the official exchange rate 
for private transactions 
the law is part of the governments broader effort at economic 
reform which has a goal of strengthening polands notoriously weak 
currency devalued regularly on mondays officials hope the zloty 
will eventually find its correct level 
before wednesday legally obtained dollars could be converted by 
poles to zlotys only at the unrealistic official rate far too low 
to be attractive there was no legal way to buy dollars with zlotys 
for now foreigners still are banned from engaging in the free 
currency market and are obliged to use the more disadvantageous 
official rate of 570 zlotys for 1 
economic authorities say making the zloty fully convertible 
immediately would be too much of a shock to the economy so for now 
they are trying only internal convertibility among poles 
pko bank officials said four of its branches in warsaw were 
trading in currencies as well as banks in other cities 
krzysztof najgrodzki manager of the capitals main pko branch 
said he regretted he couldnt spare more tellers but we are a 
savings bank and we have to attend to our regular customers 
najgrodzki said the exchange rate would be watched closely and 
could be adjusted even during the course of a day to balance 
delivery to demand 
it was too early to say how big the business would prove for the 
bank he said the pko generally plans to sell as many dollars as it 
receives but you cant sell what you dont have 
najgrodzki and his assistant robert marianski said the new law 
allows poles to do legally something that many have been doing 
illegally for years 
marianski said the bank is under no illusion that blackmarket 
trading will stop the black market was is and will be he said 
the dozens of people pressed around the exchange window 
repeatedly were beckoned by many blackmarket operators milling 
around in the bank some people even left the line to take advantage 
of the blackmarketeers faster service 
rajmond a 36yearold operator who appeared to be the chief 
black marketeer present sauntered up to a western reporter and said 
the blackmarket traders were offering the same rate as the bank 
but without having to stand in line 
for the traders he said the only difference now is that the 
bank can set the ceiling on the exchange rate they wont charge 
more for dollars than the bank but they will charge less when they 
must in order to generate business 
its a capitalist life for us i am a businessman he said 
philosophically as his helpers worked the crowd for us its 
america

discoverys astronauts overcame a 
sticky valve in the electrical system and began restoring full power 
to the space shuttle today dispelling any need to cut short the 
fiveday mission nasa said 
the shuttle started drawing fuel again from the hydrogen tank 
that had been closed because of the valve said al pennington a 
flight director 
were repowering back up at this time he said it appears 
that the tank is back in operation which means were back on a 
nominal time line 
the valve which started jamming shortly after the launch monday 
had forced the crew to dim lights and shut down unneeded computers 
to conserve power the astronauts were in no danger but officials 
said the problem could have forced the shuttle to return to earth on 
friday one day early 
pennington made his announcement at a news briefing after a 
heater in the hydrogen tank was activated to see if this would coax 
the valve to work properly 
mission control reported to the astronauts the tank heaters 
are looking real good 
ok said discovery commander michael l coats thats good 
news 
the tank is one of three that supply the shuttles 
electricitygenerating fuel cells without the tank the shuttle 
would not have enough power for five days in space plus the two days 
set aside for contingencies 
despite a dim cabin and a careful use of electrical power the 
astronauts kept to their schedule of conducting experiments and 
photographing environmentally damaged places on earth during their 
second morning in space 
they focused a powerful 70mm camera on the tanzanian plains in 
africa and then looked for evidence of pollution near zanzibar 
where a coral reef is dying other targets included the scars from a 
recent fire in the everglades and an erupting volcano in guatamala 
while over australia then in darkness coats turned discovery to 
get tv views of what he called spectacular thunderstorms 
every so often you can see a chain of lightning go off just 
like a string of firecrackers he said 
coats focused a television camera on crewmates dr james m 
bagian and robert c springer as they made a minor repair on a 
experiment and vacuumed away debris 
bob and i almost had a fight over the vacuum cleaner bagian 
joked we are the prime operators of that instrument and we wanted 
a chance to show off our prowess 
the official wakeup call was a full brass band rendition of the 
marine corps hymn played with gusto and volume 
we got two marines standing at attention up here joked 
coats a navy captain what do we do now 
astronauts james f buchli and springer are marine colonels 
bagian is a physician john e blaha is an air force colonel 
within hours of discoverys launch monday the astronauts 
deployed a 100 million tracking and data relay satellite the final 
link in a network that will give almost unbroken radio contact with 
shuttles and other satellites 
discoverys flight is the first of seven shuttle voyages planned 
for this year the mission is the third for the shuttle since the 
1986 challenger disaster that killed seven astronauts and grounded 
the shuttle fleet until september

the internal revenue service is giving the 
wrong answer to telephoned tax questions 40 percent of the time 
not the 31 percent claimed by the irs government auditors said 
wednesday 
in a rare public airing of a dispute between government agencies 
the irs told a congressional panel that both figures can be 
justified denied attempting to mislead anyone and said there is no 
pride in either error rate 
as far as the irs is concerned whether we are answering 30 
percent of the questions wrong or 40 percent of the questions wrong 
either number is absolutely unacceptable said robert lebaube irs 
director of taxpayer services 
the dispute between irs and the general accounting office an arm 
of congress is over how to judge the accuracy of answers that irs 
telephone assistors give to some of the 62 test questions that 
will be posed clandestinely by other irs employees 15000 times this 
filing season 
many of the answers irs wants to score as right are 
incomplete and potentially misleading jennie stathis of gao told 
the house government operations subcommittee on consumer affairs 
such answers would increase the likelihood of taxpayers making 
errors 
in reporting the 31 percent error rate the irs disregarded an 
agreement with gao over how the answers should be scored ms 
stathis said 
members of the subcommittee found the dispute troubling but said 
they were even more concerned about the error rate we cannot 
tolerate a situation in which the very agency which is charged with 
the enforcement of our tax laws is responsible for providing 
erroneous information to taxpayers attempting to comply with those 
laws said rep j dennis hastert rill 
lebaube advised taxpayers who call the irs tollfree numbers to 
write down their question the date and name of the person who 
provided the answer if an answer leads to an incorrect tax return 
and the taxpayer produces such a record lebaube said the irs will 
waive any penalty 
the subcommittee chaired by rep doug barnard jr dga is 
concerned about the dispute because the irs and gao which in past 
years had done separate tests of the telephoneassistance program 
agreed to work together on a single test this year the irs would 
make the test calls using questions worked out with gao and gao 
would monitor the results 
the two agencies agreed on 62 questions and set up three 
categories for scoring the answers correct the minimum 
standard irs expected its assistors to meet correct and 
complete and incorrect 
after a few weeks of conducting the test lebaube said the irs 
determined there should be a new category to cover about 8 percent 
of the answers that while not technically correct were sufficient 
to allow a taxpayer to file a correct return 
such an answer might be given after the assistor asked probing 
questions to assure the taxpayer was not leaving out essential 
information 
for example lebaube said if the test caller says he is 
from des moines iowa speaks with a midwest accent and asks whether 
he can still be claimed on his parents return the assistor may 
probe to determine age income whether he was in school and how 
much support his parents provided 
however the assistor probably would not ask whether he was a 
us citizen the failure to ask this might not meet our mutually 
agreedupon standard lebaube added however the assistor would 
in all probability be providing an answer that would allow the 
taxpayer to prepare his return correctly 
after gao refused to change its scoring method to accept such 
responses as correct irs decided on its own to count them as right 
without informing gao the irs held a news conference friday to 
announce that assistors were giving the correct answer 692 percent 
of the time 
in retrospect and in fairness to gao we probably should have 
announced both numbers lebaube said 
he insisted however that the public is misled if you do not 
characterize those answers in dispute as ones that would lead 
to a correct return 
the irs has about 5000 employees including 1500 temporaries 
answering tollfree telephone calls for assistance they must be 
high school graduates and receive at least five weeks tax training

a 14th chair was pulled up to the cabinet table 
today with the formation of the department of veterans affairs and 
president bush noted that its new head started his government career 
as an army privte 
the first secretary of veterans affairs edward j derwinksi 
took the oath of office in a private ceremony with bush in the 
roosevelt room of the white house 
in a ceremony on the south lawn of the white house immediately 
afterward derwinksi told an audience of more than 500 people many 
of them wearing the caps of veterans groups that they had a right 
to expect the best possible service but he cautioned this 
isnt the worlds best time in washington for matters involving the 
budget a theme he has been sounding for weeks 
bush praised derwinski as uniquely qualified to lead the new 
agency because he has the skill of a seasoned legislator the 
patience of a practical administrator the finesse of a diplomat and 
the heart of a man who knows what it means to start his government 
career as a private in the united states army 
derwinski is a former 12term member of the house from illinois 
who served in highlevel state department posts in the reagan 
administration he served in the army in 19451946 and took part in 
the occupation of japan 
the veterans department formed from the old veterans 
administration is the secondlargest agency of the government 
behind the defense department with 240000 employees its annual 
spending of about 29 billion is the fifth largest among agencies 
it expects to keep the short title from its past va 
veterans organizations for years sought the greater clout they 
thought cabinet rank would give them but it took an electionyear 
conversion by former president reagan last year to put the idea 
across 
derwinski has six months to make organizational changes he 
believes necessary but already hes decided they wont be 
drastic 
in an interview earlier this week he repeated a warning he has 
been giving veterans groups along with promises to drop in for a 
beer at their local halls that in the next four years there are 
going to be some painful budget decisions 
my job is to see that the va does better in the budget 
infighting than it would have if i werent aboard he said 
i dont believe in the short run we have any monumental 
problems derwinski said if there are shortfalls its mainly 
because of the budget battle 
a year ago the national academy of public administration said it 
did not believe cabinet status would significantly improve either 
access to the president the adequacy of necessary resources or the 
organization management and delivery of highquality services and 
benefits 
va officials told congress last year the 108 billion allocated 
for medical care in this years 298 billion va budget would be at 
least 600 million short most hospitals already have begun to 
curtail care to veterans where they have discretion to do so 
some of the agencys medical issues have been making news for 
years an estimated 479000 vietnam veterans one in five who served 
there suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder bringing 
flashbacks and disorientation 
much controversy and money have gone into studies of the vietnam 
defoliant agent orange and the issue is not settled yet though the 
va has said it can find no significant difference in cancer rates 
between exposed veterans and others 
the big problem is one interestingly where there is no 
debate aging derwinski said the patients needs start to 
change it ultimately means longterm health care rather than 
dramatic surgical procedures 
there are more than 27 million veterans counting dependents a 
third of the nation is eligible for one or another of the services 
provided by the huge but fairly uncomplicated bureaucracy 
dispensing medical care and 17 billion a year in pensions and other 
money benefits and operating 111 national ceremonies 
with 172 hospitals 229 outpatient clinics and scores of other 
installations the agency runs the largest medical care system in 
the country caring for 14 million hospital patients annually 
the vas motto comes from lincolns second inaugural address 
to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow 
and his orphan the agency traces its history to the plymouth 
colony law of 1636 for the maintenance of members disabled in the 
pequot indian war though the va was formed only in 1930 to 
consolidate veterans program in other departments

city high school on tuesday said police sgt ray bledsoe

shooting said an administrator who talked with his parents friends 
and teachers 
bill anthony district director of secondary education said the 
boys parents had not noticed anything abnormal about his mood or 
activity that morning 
as far as they knew there had not been any girlfriend breakup 
or any kind of loss in the family or any other problems in the 
family anthony said 
i have not heard anyone either students faculty or family 
that have indicated a reason for why the boy shot himself 
however principal richard pemberton said school officials 
recommended earlier in the school year that the boys parents take 
their son for counseling for emotional problems 
pemberton who would not discuss the problems or the boys 
academic or disciplinary record said the parents cooperated and 
the boy attended three days of sessions

school but said nothing before pulling the trigger as his science 
class began students told police nobody actually had seen him 
come out with the gun bledsoe said 
the students who were in the room received counseling from 
administrators and psychiatrists pemberton said 
anthony said the boys parents were sure he took the gun from

business inventories continued their steady 
rise in january accompanied by healthy growth in sales the 
government said wednesday in a report that showed continued strength 
in the aging economic expansion 
inventories held on shelves and backlots rose 07 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 7662 billion in january the 25th straight 
month in which inventories have increased the commerce department 
reported 
sales meanwhile rose 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted 5139 
billion in january the increase came despite a 17 percent drop in 
auto sales that was accompanied by a 19 percent rise in stocks of 
unsold cars during january 
an advance report on februarys retail sales said auto purchases 
were down another 17 percent last month 
analysts said car purchases have been held down by rising 
interest rates and reduced demand after strong sales last year 
carmakers recently have boosted incentive offers in an effort to 
spur sales and general motors corp has temporarily halted 
production at two plants to reduce inventory 
overall januarys activity produced no change in the ratio of 
business inventories to sales which stood at 149 meaning it would 
take 149 months to exhaust inventories at januarys sales pace 
economist robert defina of security pacific national bank in los 
angeles said the balance between inventories and sales signals 
continued moderate growth without the big imbalance that usually 
precedes a major downturn 
charles renfro chief economist at the alphametrics forecasting 
firm in bala cynwyd pa said the figures suggest the economy is 
still moving ahead but at a moderate pace that shouldnt add to 
inflationary pressures 
rising inventories if not accompanied by corresponding increases 
in sales can lead to production cutbacks that would hamper economic 
growth but recent growth in inventories generally has been 
accompanied by rising sales with autos being the exception 
robert g dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago cautioned that businesses will have to be fast on their 
feet to avoid an unwanted buildup of excess inventories in the 
event of a sales slowdown 
if demand doesnt remain as solid as it has been 
inventories could quickly become heavy dederick said 
januarys increase in inventories included a 09 percent rise in 
stocks held by manufacturers a 02 percent boost in stockpiles at 
the wholesale level and a 09 percent increase in inventories held 
by retailers 
the rise in sales included a 03 percent advance in sales by 
manufacturers a 23 percent increase at the wholesale level and a 
07 percent increase in retail purchases despite the slowdown in 
car sales 
analysts said januarys strong retail sales were due partly to 
unusually mild weather that brought out more shoppers 
februarys advance report on retail sales released tuesday 
showed purchases were down 04 percent last month held back by the 
sharp drop in business at car dealerships

individual physicians styles of practice are an 
important factor in determining whether pregnant women have 
caesarean sections a study concludes 
the doctors who conducted the study said that while their 
findings were not a surprise they were the first to document the 
powerful influence of the socalled physician factor 
we demonstrated that given a very homogenous lowrisk 
affluent population there was an extremely wide variation in the 
rate of caesarean section said dr gergory l goyert the 
conclusion is that an individual clinician is a major determinant of 
the method of delivery 
the research was published in thursdays issue of the new england 
journal of medicine 
the study conducted at an unidentified community hospital in 
suburban detroit was based on 11 obstetricians who delivered 1533 
babies during one year their rates of caesarean section ranged from 
19 percent to 42 percent among women who had not had previous 
caesareans the rates ranged from 10 to 32 percent depending on the 
doctor 
this variation could not be attributed to differences in the 
patients the degree of obstetrical risk or whether the physicians 
had been sued recently for malpractice 
the researchers could not prove that any of the caesareans were 
needless however the patients of doctors who did a lot of 
caesareans fared no better than those of physicians who performed 
the operations more sparingly 
over the past two decades the casesarean rate in the united 
states has increased from 5 percent of all births to 25 percent 
many factors are thought to contribute to this increase including 
the safety of caesareans increasing concern for the welfare of the 
fetus and fear of being sued if something goes wrong during a 
vaginal delivery 
the study did not determine why some doctors did more caesareans 
than others i can only believe that they have the fetuss and 
patients best interests at heart said goyert a physician at 
sinai hospital of detroit

cleaning up contamination and radioactive waste 
at the governments nuclear weapons plants may cost much less than 
the 60 billion to 100 billion commonly estimated energy secretary 
james d watkins told congress wednesday 
i believe we can do this for a lot less watkins told a 
senate budget subcommittee in his first appearance on capitol hill 
since his swearing in last week 
watkins did not make his own estimate but promised to produce 
later this year a detailed blueprint including cost projections 
for an initial fiveyear effort to clean up the weapons sites and 
modernize the aging facilities in 12 states 
the energy department in an estimate published before watkins 
took over said modernization and cleanup of the weapons complex 
would cost at least 81 billion over the next 21 years the general 
accounting office has put the cost at more than 100 billion 
in testimony before the senate panel keith o fultz the gaos 
director of energy issues maintained that current cost estimates 
probably were too low given that no one yet knows how bad some of 
the contamination is and the feasibility of cleanup 
watkins refuted this he said scenarios for accomplishing the 
cleanup often contain expensive unneeded frills 
watkins also said he was confident his department could safely 
restart the savannah river plant nuclear reactors in south carolina 
which are the nations only source of tritium a radioactive gas 
needed in the manufacture of nuclear warheads the three reactors 
there have been closed for nearly a year because of safety concerns 
i believe we can get those reactors up he said adding that 
he planned to meet soon with senior executives of westinghouse 
electric corp which on april 1 takes over for ei du pont de 
nemours amp co as contract manager at savannah river 
the energy department and westinghouse have said they would 
produce a detailed plan for restarting the savannah river reactors 
by the end of this month 
the timing of a restart at savannah river is considered important 
because the shutdown has raised questions about the adequacy of us 
tritium supplies 
watkins said he already was developing a plan that would get the 
savannah river reactors running again and keep them in safe 
operation for at least a decade time enough to allow for the 
construction of a new generation of reactors 
he defended the bush administrations plan for spending 68 
billion to build two tritiumproducing reactors one at savannah 
river and the other in idaho critics have said only one reactor at 
most will be needed in the foreseeable future 
robert b barker the pentagons assistant secretary for atomic 
energy told the panel the two new reactors would be capable of 
producing 150 percent of the nations tritium needs he strongly 
defended the plan saying extra production capacity was needed to 
guard against unforeseen technical or other problems 
across capitol hill a house subcommittee sent to the full energy 
and commerce committee legislation to create an independent 
11member board to oversee the cleanup of the governments nuclear 
weapons plants

during the 34year reign of president 
alfredo stroessner his senior aides got rich through kickbacks and 
fraud court cases allege few paraguayans doubt that el viejo 
the old man did too 
but the new government of gen andres rodriguez and the ruling 
colorado party have expressed little interest in pursuing whether 
stroessner should be investigated 
rodriguez was a friend of stroessners and his daughter marta 
is married to stroessners son alfredo a trial also could prove 
embarrassing to the party which has held power since 1947 
after the feb 3 coup foreign minister luis maria argana said 
the country must look to the future and forget about the past 
no apparent efforts have been made since then to seize 
stroessners assets and a lawsuit seeking his return from exile in 
brazil to face possible corruption charges has languished in court 
i see no political interest in trying stroessner said oscar 
paciello on leave as president of the paraguay bar association 
during his 34 years in power a lot of people here today were by 
his side and a trial would leave the altars without any saints 
estimates of stroessners alleged illgotten gains run into the 
hundreds of millions of dollars although proof of that is as hard 
to come by as evidence of what he did with any such money 
after the coup there were no discoveries of fabulous art 
collections luxurious hideaways foreign bank accounts or closets 
stuffed with furs jewels and shoes such as followed the flights to 
exile of dictators anastasio somoza ferdinand marcos and 
jeanclaude duvalier 
stroessner was much more intelligent than somoza who had 
businesses in his name said journalist ricardo canese 
stroessner received commissions and dividends without ever 
becoming part of the business itself without any document bearing 
his name 
the 76yearold exarmy commander lived simply in this hot 
steamy south america capital since he took power in a 1954 coup he 
shunned a flamboyant lifestyle 
nevertheless many paraguayans including aldo zuccolillo editor 
of the newspaper abc color are convinced that a simple lifestyle 
masked but did not hide stroessners systematic plundering 
zuccolillo alleges stroessner allowed refineria paraguaya sa 
to charge the government as much as twice the world price for oil 
from 197479 and pocketed 800 million abc color published the

afghan jets bombed guerrilla positions 
around jalalabad on wednesday and afghanistans staterun radio 
said hundreds of insurgents were killed in a failed attempt to 
capture the strategic city 
the guerrillas admitted that bombing by communist troops hampered 
their advance on jalalabad but they claimed to have shot down five 
airplanes and killed more than 100 government soldiers in the last 
two days they reported heavy civilian casualties from the bombing 
afghanistans official radio kabul monitored in islamabad said 
government air and ground forces repulsed the guerrillas after they 
fired 5000 rockets and shells in an attempt to take the city in 
eastern afghanistan 
it said that over the previous 24 hours 560 guerrillas and 
supporters were killed and 252 were wounded it said the dead 
included four americans a saudi national and some pakistanis 
pakistan the united states and saudi arabia back the moslem 
guerrillas in their war with the communist government but deny 
having any nationals fighting in afghanistan 
the battle for jalalabad 42 miles from the pakistan border is 
the first test of strength of kabuls communist rulers and their 
opponents since the last soviet soldiers left afghanistan on feb 15 
its fall would be a blow to the morale of the mainly conscripted 
army and a big boost to the guerrillas who have been fighting 10 
years to establish an islamic republic of afghanistan 
observers believe a guerrilla victory could have a domino effect 
on the countrys other communistheld cities including kabul the 
capital 
the guerrillas began their offensive march 6 and by last weekend 
had captured the communist garrison at samarkhel six miles east of 
jalababad 
the communists retaliated with heavy highaltitude aerial 
bombing 
the air forces are taking a direct part in defending the 
country and demolishing the gathering place of the invaders 
this success worried the enemy and they are thinking these are 
not afghan pilots radio kabul said wednesday night 
guerrillas have claimed the fighterbombers are piloted by 
soviets in violation of the unmediated accord that provided for 
the soviet withdrawal 
despite communist claims guerrilla sources say they have lost 
only about 150 men in the offensive and captured more than 700 
government troops 
government and guerrilla versions of the fighting usually 
contradict and tend to be exaggerated 
however journalists and witnesses have reported the battle for 
jalalabad has sent hundreds of wounded guerrillas and thousands of 
civilians over the border into pakistan 
the guerrillarun afghan news agency said insurgents also were 
attacking communist posts around the northern city of baghlan and 
the southeastern city of kandahar the countrys secondlargest 
it said attacks near baghlan on monday killed 70 communist 
troops wounded 50 and destroyed five tanks

white americans benefitting from dramatic 
declines across the population in heart disease and strokes are 
living longer than ever but black americans increasingly the 
victims of homicide and aids are seeing their life expectancy fall 
further 
that is the picture painted by the latest tally of the nations 
health released wednesday and theres more 
blacks are twice as likely to die in infancy as whites pregnant 
black women receive early prenatal care far less than whites blacks 
are disproportionately afflicted with influenza and pneumonia 
health secretary louis sullivan said the report showed as the 
statistics have since 1970 that there is a disparity between the 
health of our white and black populations 
dr manning feinleib director of the national center for health 
statistics told reporters that the basic causes for blacks 
declining life expectancy relate to nutrition poverty and 
access to health care that affect a wide variety of conditions 
from infant mortality to mortality at later ages 
one other likely cause feinleib mentioned drugrelated murders 
buttressing that assessment the death rate among black men 
frequently the victims of drugrelated violence was 50 percent 
higher than for white men in 1986 the last year for which 
comprehensive statistics were available 
in all the report health united states painted this 
statistical picture for 1986 
a child born that year could expect to live 748 years up from 
747 years in 1985 
a white child had a life expectancy of 754 years in 1986 up 
from 753 
but a black child born that year could expect to die at just 
694 years down from 695 in 1985 and 697 in 1984 
life expectancies were not calculated for other population groups 
much of the improvement in overall life expectancy was laid to 
dramatic declines in heart disease and stroke which have come about 
largely because more and more americans are giving up smoking or not 
starting at all smoking is a risk factor for both diseases 
from 1970 to 1986 deaths from heart disease fell 31 percent 
although the disease remains the leading cause of death in america 
during the same period deaths from stroke the third leading cause 
dropped 53 percent 
now said sullivan the nation needs to focus more attention on 
such critical areas as prevention of aids unintentional injuries 
homicide and suicide 
as for aids the report said that the percentage of males age 13 
or older infected with the deadly virus rose at least 30 percent 
based on preliminary data from 1987 to 1988 
among blacks the aids infection rate rose 51 percent among 
females it skyrocketed 67 percent 42 percent among white females 
74 percent among blacks and 97 percent among hispanics 
infant mortality was cut in half from 1970 to 1986 from 20 
deaths per 1000 births in 1970 to 104 per 1000 births in 1986 
preliminary data for 1987 and 1988 however show the decline is 
slowing the mortality rate for black infants was 18 deaths per 
1000 births in 1986 compared with 89 per 1000 births for whites 
the report a compilation of previously released material also 
said 
substantially more white women 79 percent and women of asian 
and pacific islander descent 76 percent receive prenatal care in 
the first three months of a pregnancy than black women 62 percent 
or american indian women 61 percent among hispanic women early 
prenatal care was highest among cubans 82 percent and lowest among 
puerto ricans 57 percent 
births among unmarried women more than doubled from 1970 to 
1986 from 11 percent to 23 percent of all births in 1986 11 
percent of women of asian and pacific islander descent who gave 
birth were unmarried compared with 16 percent of white women 42 
percent of american indian women and 61 percent of black women 
accidents including those involving motor vehicles were the 
fourth leading cause of death overall in 1986 and the most frequent 
cause of death among men under the age of 65 
although homicide ranks 12th among all causes for death it 
takes nearly as many lives as accidental injuries for black males 
who die before age 65 
the suicide rate for white men in 1986 was nearly double that of 
black men on average 21 of each 100000 deaths among white men 
were suicides compared with 12 for black men 5 for white women and 
2 for black women 
influenza and pheunomia caused 28 of each 100000 deaths among 
black men far higher than the 18 per 100000 rate posted for white 
men among black women 13 of each 100000 deaths were caused by 
influenza and pheunomia among white women the number was 10

bail was set at 945000 for a man accused of 
hammering an elderly woman to death and severely injuring his 
exgirlfriend while he was out of jail on a twoday furlough 
police have since acknowledged that edward beets 29 was 
overheard in the north las vegas jail arguing by telephone with 
someone later identified as the exgirlfriend 
beets is charged with murder in the death friday of oretha hames 
71 and the attempted murder of her daughter vanita hames 28 who 
is listed in stable condition at university medical center 
beets was sentenced to 45 days in jail earlier this year for 
trespassing and domestic battery at the girlfriends house he was 
given a twoday pass to attend an aunts funeral and the attack 
occurred while he was on furlough 
north las vegas municipal judge gary davis who has a reputation 
of being one of the areas toughest judges approved the pass davis 
said tuesday he would not change the furlough policy because to do 
so would penalize deserving inmates 
ive been doing a lot of soulsearching davis said should 
i punish everyone in the future because this man did something 
horrible it was a kindness to beets family that turned into a 
nightmare 
davis had sentenced beets to 45 days in jail on charges of 
misdemeanor trespass at the hames home the judge said the city 
prosecutor had only asked for 10 days police said beets had been 
arrested previously at the address for domestic battery and 
trespassing 
police were called to the hames home in the predawn hours by 
vanita hames 8yearold daughter who said her grandmother had been 
knocked out they found the elderly woman dead and her daughter 
suffering from a fractured skull and hammer wounds to the neck 
chest arms and legs 
assistant police chief ron lusch said jail guards overheard beets 
having an angry phone conversation with someone last week beets 
later told a guard he had been talking to his girlfriend 
lusch said such phone arguments are not uncommon at the jail 
were governed by law that we cant monitor inmates phone 
calls he said if we had any inkling of danger proper 
authorities would have been notified 
davis said police often inform him of unusual circumstances 
involving prisoners but did not do so with beets 
if wed have had that information it would have made a world 
of difference in what we had done davis said 
the judge believes however that even if beets had been denied a 
furlough it might simply have delayed the inevitable 
if that was his intention i dont think if we kept him in a 
week longer or two weeks longer it would have made any 
difference davis said 
beets is to be arraigned march 23 on the latest charges

arduous life in beirut maintaining a sense of calm while going 
about his job with determination and refusing to be intimidated by 
the war around him 
as he begins his fifth year as a hostage in lebanon on thursday 
accounts from freed hostages describe a man still making the best of 
the worst circumstances and trying to encourage others to do the 
same 
anderson was born oct 27 1947 in lorain ohio he went to high 
school in batavia ny and graduated from iowa state university

to south africa but was back in beirut in november as the bureaus 
news editor 
anderson became the chief middle east correspondent in august 
1983 
six years in the marines including time in vietnam contributed 
to a fearlessness that gave anderson an aura of invincibility 
he would listen to jazz tapes while maneuvering his car around 
tanks in beiruts wartorn streets on some mornings he would jog 
or walk along the mediterranean accompanied only by his dog jolie 
when a visiting reporter once confessed she didnt know what a 
rocketpropelled grenade was anderson approached a group of 
militiamen dining at a restaurant and asked for a closer look at 
their weapons 
he was one of the first reporters on the scene when shiite moslem 
suicide bombers blew up the us embassy and marine barracks in west 
beirut in 1983 
he was one of those people who seemed somehow invincible 
said robert fisk of the times of london a friend of andersons 
he had no reason to be frightened because he had made no enemies 
in lebanon if terry anderson could be abducted then no one was 
safe 
the illusion was shattered march 16 1985 after anderson played 
a game of tennis three young men in a green mercedes kidnapped him 
at gunpoint the proiranian shiite group islamic jihad claimed 
responsibility 
anderson is the longestheld of the 15 foreigners in captivity in 
lebanon his father and brother both died of cancer in 1986 he has 
never seen his younger daughter sulome born shortly after his 
abduction 
his family has little encouragement except accounts of freed 
hostages who describe a man who has not lost his will 
the rev benjamin weir a presbyterian clergyman who was released 
by captors in september 1985 after 16 months as a hostage told how 
anderson led worship services with other hostages and fashioned 
flash cards from cheese wrappers so he could learn arabic 
weir carried a letter from anderson when he was freed in which 
anderson wrote that the hostages main problem was keeping occupied 
he said the other men and the bible have kept me sane 
anderson who had started himself on a health kick shortly before 
being kidnapped reportedly exercises and even wrestled with his 
guard 
in the marines anderson was a combat correspondent in vietnam 
and worked as a reporter anchorman and station manager for the 
armed forces radio and television service in japan he was 
discharged as a staff sergeant and spent three years as a radio and 
television newsman at krnt and kccitv in des moines iowa

state university working in detroit louisville ky and new york 
before taking overseas assignments to tokyo johannesburg and

something that he liked and happened to be good at said his 
sister peggy say he really loved his job

the sister of american journalist terry 
anderson and a former hostage in lebanon called wednesday for 
renewed attention to the plight of those still held captive in the 
mideast and urged conciliation with iran 
peggy say said she fears prospects for her brothers release have 
worsened because his captors proiranian shiite moslem extremists 
are angry about the publication of salman rushdies novel the 
satanic verses which they consider blasphemous 
every event that takes place in the middle east has the 
potential effect hostages have died hostages have been executed 
so when things happen the families are in an immediate panic 
said mrs say 
she and the rev lawrence m jenco a hostage who was released in 
1986 were interviewed on cable news networks los angelesbased 
talk show sonya it was part of a series of appearances leading 
up to thursdays fouryear anniversary of the day anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press was kidnapped in 
beirut 
anderson is the longest held of the 15 foreign hostages in 
lebanon nine are american 
if this were a hundred americans would we be here on your 
program today four years later debating what is the right thing to 
do for these people mrs say asked if we ignore nine today 
what will we ignore tomorrow will we then ignore 19 or 90 some day 
are we going to wake up and say my god whats happened to our 
world 
she said the right thing was for the bush administration to 
open a dialogue with iran and to seek reconciliation 
a key element for the americans release would be a decision by 
the united states to unfreeze iranian assets it holds from arms 
sales to the deposed shah said jenco 
mrs say said she believed her brother has been held hostage the 
longest because he is a journalist 
they counted on the fact that he is a journalist that the 
whole journalistic community would rise up in his defense as it has 
for so many others she said they have never understood as i 
guess i have never understood nor has terry why that hasnt 
happened 
jenco said the united states should set an example for parts of 
the world that dont understand americas framework of freedom 
in my own heart i believe that we should reflect to the world a 
kinder gentler nation hoping that the world itself will become a 
kinder gentler world the roman catholic priest said

the number of taxpayers itemizing deductions is 
down 25 percent this year apparently because of the 1986 tax 
overhaul the internal revenue service said wednesday 
about 41 percent of the long form 1040 returns filed through last 
weekend had itemized deductions compared with 49 percent for the 
same period last year 
this suggests people may be finding it more advantageous not to 
itemize because of a higher standard deduction and fewer itemized 
deductions permitted under the new tax law said irs spokesman steve 
pyrek 
overall 433 million couples and individuals had filed their 
returns through last week 22 percent more than the 424 million 
last year the irs has processed 293 million also 22 percent more 
than the 287 million at this time in 1988 
the long form has accounted for 211 million returns this year 
or 49 percent of the total compared with 217 million or 51 
percent a year ago filings of the short form 1040a are up 75 
percent to 107 million and use of the singlepage 1040ez for 
single people is up 67 percent to 114 million 
the number of refunds is down 3 percent to 184 million the 
average refund is up 3 percent to 827 
the irs said 861916 taxpayers had filed returns electronically 
through professional return preparers that compares with 362000 in 
the same period a year ago

india on wednesday refused to release an 
inquiry on the 1984 assassination of prime minister indira gandhi 
prompting an uproar in the lower house of parliament 
the government rejected demands by opposition politicians to 
release a secret report that allegedly links a powerful government 
aide to the slaying 
some of the 90 opposition members in the 545member lower house 
chanted dictatorship will not be tolerated and we want the 
report 
in a voice vote the governing congress party suspended at least 
63 of the opposition members for the rest of the week for 
misbehavior most of the other opposition members walked out in 
protest 
all 93 opposition members in the 245member upper house also 
walked out 
a newspaper said the report indicated the aide changed the time 
of the television interview mrs gandhi was heading toward when she 
was killed concealed the fact that he knew one of her assassins 
and let mrs gandhi walk ahead of him just before she was gunned 
down 
home minister buta singh said a special team had investigated the 
suspicions against mrs gandhis private secretary rajendra kumar 
dhawan and found that he was totally innocent 
dhawan 52 has refused to comment on the reports 
dhawan was dropped from his post after the assassination but was 
brought back into the government last month as a key aide to rajiv 
gandhi mrs gandhis son and successor 
the 1986 inquiry by supreme court justice mp thakkar was 
supressed by the government in what it said was the interest of 
national security 
several newspapers speculated wednesday that the report may have 
been leaked to the indian express the countrys largest selling 
englishlanguage newspaper by cabinet ministers who felt threatened 
by dhawans return 
mrs gandhi was killed oct 31 1984 in her new delhi residence 
by two of her sikh bodyguards as she walked to a television 
interview 
one of the sikhs was shot and killed by other bodyguards minutes 
later and the other was convicted of murder and hanged in january 
a third sikh who was convicted of conspiracy was also hanged 
the newspaper said he knew beant singh the assassin who was 
killed by other bodyguards but he denied that during questioning 
the government says mrs gandhi was killed in revenge for an army 
raid she ordered in june 1984 on the golden temple the holiest sikh 
shrine 
at least 1200 people many of them sikhs were killed in the 
raid which was aimed at flushing out sikh extremists barricaded 
inside the shrine 
sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for an independent 
homeland in punjab a rich farming state in northern india 
sikhs comprise only 2 percent of indias 880 million people but 
are in a majority in punjab they claim they are discriminated 
against by the hindus who make up 80 percent of the population

two lawmakers proposed legislation wednesday to 
require food labels to disclose more nutrition information about the 
content of cholesterolraising saturated fats 
the purpose of this legislation is to try to deal with the 
problems consumers have when they are faced with a web of confusing 
and misleading labels on the foods they are buying said rep dan 
glickman dkan who chairs the house agriculture subcommittee on 
wheat soybeans and feed grains 
at a news conference he and sen tom harkin diowa complained 
that current labeling laws allow foods to make claims of no 
cholesterol or 100 percent vegetable shortening even though 
they contain cooking oils with high levels of saturated fat 
the american heart association which supports the legislation 
says a diet low in saturated fat will help reduce the risk of heart 
disease 
the bill would require food labels to disclose nutrition 
information including saturated fat content by serving if 
packages display a claim about the products cholesterol content 
or say that it was made with vegetable oil 
packages do not specifically identify which vegetable oil is 
contained in the product some labels now show only that a product 
was made with any of a variety of oils including highly saturated 
tropical oils like palm and coconut oil

mayor marion barry jr trying to curb 
drugrelated crime signed legislation wednesday to strengthen the 
citys handgun law asked police to work sixday weeks and said he 
will allow a curfew to become law in a bid to keep most teenagers 
off the streets late at night 
he signed an emergency measure mandating a fiveyear jail term 
for anyone convicted of even having access to a gun while committing 
a crime in the city and giving judges the option of denying 
pretrial release of defendants caught with weapons

conference if you got your gun you better get rid of it because 
if you get caught youre going to spend five years in jail

reviwed by the city council strengthens previous law which required 
a jail term of five years only if a weapon was used to commit a 
crime 
barry said the citys 3920 police will be asked to work sixday 
work weeks for the next five weeks until recruits complete their 
training he said this step would cost the city about 26 million 
in overtime he also authorized the police department to hire 150 
more people by may 1 
barry said he would allow an emergency curfew bill to take 
effect without his signature on thursday it will not be enforced 
until monday to give police time to learn the rules the curfew bars

the foreign ministers of the five nations will ask the united 
nations to begin setting up the peacekeeping force a step tinoco 
called a formality 
in february the foreign ministers agreed in principle that un 
military observers should operate in the region to verify reports of 
guerrilla activity and by their presence deter such raids 
the united nations then drafted a plan calling for up to 100 
military observers backed by 60 pilots drivers and civilian 
administrators from canada spain and west germany 
a un diplomat said the plan will not conflict with us 
intentions to keep the contras active by providing nonlethal aid 
the current congressional sixmonth appropriation of 271 
million for the contras expires at the end of march and the bush 
administration is hoping to renew it 
it does not preempt the humanitarian aid for the contras it 
does give the united states the breathing space they want for the 
rebels he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the foreign ministers are to meet march 2920 in san jose costa 
rica to take the next step on the peacekeeping plan and discuss 
other central american issues

the economy grew at a moderately strong pace 
early this year with widespread evidence of upward pressure on 
production costs and prices the federal reserve board reported 
wednesday 
consumer spending except for autos has apparently gained 
momentum while manufacturing especially for export continues to 
show strength almost everywhere said the report based on surveys 
conducted by the feds 12 district banks 
the study found that with labor markets tight and factories 
continuing to operate at high levels even as they expand and 
modernize materials and product prices are edging up albeit 
sporadically and at an uneven pace 
the survey known as the tan book was prepared for the march 28 
meeting of the feds policymaking open market committee the panel 
which sets policy for the central bank 
the fed since last march has been nudging interest rates upward 
in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus restrain 
inflation those efforts intensified last month after concern about 
inflation heightened with news that consumer prices rose 06 percent 
in january and wholesale prices surged 1 percent 
the most recent fed report based on survey results received 
through march 8 found that economic activity for most of the 
country is reported to be expanding at a moderately strong pace 
the weakest sectors of the economy are energy and to a lesser 
extent construction it said 
the survey found strong gains in consumer spending with the 
exception of autos for which business has been slow so far this 
year domestic automakers recently boosted incentive offers in an 
effort to stimulate sales and general motors corp has temporarily 
halted production at two plants to reduce inventories 
sales of apparel particularly womens clothing contributed 
significantly to the strength in consumer spending some districts 
also reported brisk sales of home furnishings and electronics 
most of the districts found some tightness in manufacturing labor 
markets with some expectations of increasing upward pressure on 
costs and prices due either to current strong conditions or 
attempts to pass through last years large increases in costs for 
raw materials 
manufacturers generally are optimistic about production prospects 
as exports outpace growth in domestic demand the report said 
the banks reported some of the largest and broadbased increases 
in capital spending often viewed as a barometer of business 
investment plans were in the chicago region in general though 
capital spending is not expected to exceed last years strong pace 
the report said 
often investment spending was aimed at improving efficiency and 
modernizing equipment rather than for expanding capacity the survey 
found 
while industries in several districts are said to be operating 
close to full capacity there are few comments about serious 
bottlenecks the survey said

fortythree chinese intellectuals added their 
voice wednesday to the growing demands for democracy in an open 
letter calling for the release of political prisoners 
police meanwhile in an apparent attempt to censure leading 
intellectuals stopped a meeting to discuss a new magazine from 
taking place 
wednesdays open letter was the fourth sent to chinas leaders 
since january and came five days before the opening of an important 
political meeting the national peoples congress 
su wei a 35yearold scholar of literature at the chinese 
academy of social sciences said he wrote the letter because he 
could not stay silent any longer 
i have no interest in politics and i am not a hero he said 
writing this letter should be a meaningless thing but the way my 
country works it is a very serious thing 
as the country prepares to celebrate its 40th anniversary 
the letter says we urge the national peoples congress to 
release a large number of detained prisoners 
the note also supports a recent call for the release of wei 
jingsheng chinas most wellknown political prisoner he was 
sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in prison for urging democracy 
the signatories included scholars liu mingjiu an expert on 
french philosopher jeanpaul sartre and chen jiaying who 
specializes in german thinker martin heidegger 
participants said the letter was written during a time of growing 
political repression 
they cited the recent police action that kept astrophysicist fang 
lizhi chinas leading dissident from attending a banquet president 
bush held on his visit to beijing earlier this month 
they said the government had warned them of unspecified 
punishment awaiting those who write and sign public letters 
on tuesday chinas leading government spokesman yuan mu said 
the state was not happy with such appeals for political reform 
and accused government critics of relying on foreign forces to 
spread their message 
su said he would like his letter to be published in china but 
the press here is run by the state 
the government uses pressure to stop the news and then blames 
us for contacting the foreign media said dai qing an author who 
signed the letter 
amnesty for political prisoners was first proposed by fang lizhi 
in january in an open letter to chinese leader deng xiaoping 
in february 33 intellectuals signed a second letter hundreds of 
people in hong kong and taiwan and chinese in the united states 
signed petitions supporting the call in march 42 leading chinese 
scientists joined in 
chinese sources said several signatories of the february letter 
had been invited to attend a meeting tuesday to begin the first 
issue of ideologist magazine but that police stopped the gathering 
from taking place 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
meeting of about 50 of chinas leading intellectuals initially had 
been scheduled for a hotel in downtown beijing 
when i got there i saw a sign saying the meeting had been 
canceled because there was no electricity said one but i went 
upstairs and there was lots of electricity just not in the room we 
had reserved 
organizers moved the meeting to a nearby restaurant 
but when we got there the meeting was canceled again 
another participant said police said we needed permission to 
meet 
the sources said they believed police stopped the gathering to 
censure several of the signers of the february letter most notably 
su shaozhi and wang ruoshui 
su a leading marxist theoretician was dismissed from his post 
as head of chinas marxismleninism institute because of his 
liberalism wang was fired as deputy chief editor of the peoples 
daily for advocating humanism 
they sources said ideologist a shanghaibased periodical a 
combination of political essays and literary criticism probably 
would not be affected

student radicals who paralyzed harvard 
university in april 1969 by occupying a campus building and staging 
a twoweek strike are coming back to commemorate the event and its 
impact far beyond harvard yard 
before comparing graying hair and mellowed politics theyre 
planning to kick off the event with a rally just like the old days 
its important to reaffirm in some public fashion and some 
social context the values and beliefs of 20 years ago said 
reunion spokesman michael macy now 40 and a sociology professor at 
brandeis university 
invitations to the april 78 event are being relayed by word of 
mouth among those who forged enduring friendships while attending 
harvard from 1968 to 1971 and participating in the protests 
in addition to the noon rally speeches by harvard alumni and 
faculty guerrilla theater a teachin formal debates and a reunion 
party are on the agenda buses will be provided for alumni who want 
to leave after the reunion party saturday to attend an equal rights 
and prochoice demonstration in washington on sunday 
the campus upheavals of the 1960s kicked off with the free speech 
movement at the university of california at berkeley in 1964 across 
the country students began marching and protesting against americas 
presence in vietnam and other establishment policies 
when the ferment hit the countrys oldest and most prestigious 
university attention was riveted on the breeding ground for the 
nations elite 
as rihard rowe then an assistant dean of the graduate school of 
education observed at the time the radicals seemed to feel that 
harvard must excel in riots as well as in intellect 
shortly after noon on april 9 1969 some 300 students seized 
harvards main administration building threw out nine deans and 
chained the doors they ignored administration orders to leave 
university hall 
among other demands the protesters wanted to get rid of the 
campus units of the us militarys reserve officer training corps 
units and expand the afroamerican studies program 
when dawn broke the following day more than 400 state and local 
police charged the building with a battering ram pulling students 
out by the hair beating them with nightsticks and kicking them 
about 45 people were injured some after jumping from firstfloor 
windows police carted off 197 people to the middlesex county jail 
one of those arrested was abc news correspondent chris wallace 
then a reporter for the harvard student radio station 
we were all allowed to make that famous one telephone call 
wallace said in an interview wednesday some people called their 
girlfriends i called the radio station at the end of my report i 
signed off this is chris wallace in custody 
wallace said he didnt know about next months reunion i was 
no radical he said but added that he had protested against the 
vietnam war 
the show of force by police and the willingness of the university 
to deploy them galvanized more morderate students a threeday 
boycott of classes stretched into a 15day strike in which students 
virtually shut down the school 
rock music and the chants of protestors throbbed in harvard yard 
and outside administrative offices students hung banners saying 
strike from dorm windows and wore tshirts emblazoned with an 
upraised clenched fist the harvard studentdesigned symbol went on 
to become an international symbol of protest 
the few students who didnt boycott classes were taught out of 
doors in a physics class someone wrote on the blackboard no 
classes today no ruling class tomorrow the instructor told the 
five students who showed up that that was the days lesson 
by the time the strike officially ended april 25 school 
administrators agreed to abolish rotc on campus to set up a 
department of african and afroamerican studies and to build 
lowcost housing for people displaced by expansion projects

president pw botha returned to 
work wednesday eight weeks after suffering a stroke but he didnt 
say how he plans to resolve a power struggle with party members who 
want a new head of state 
botha held a morning cabinet meeting and was present in 
parliament during the afternoon when finance minister barend du 
plessis announced the 198990 budget 
neither botha nor any other members of the governing national 
party commented on the developments wednesday 
botha has yet to make a public statement on a declaration by the 
national party parliamentary caucus including the full cabinet 
that it wants the new party leader education minister fw de 
klerk to take over as president 
botha and de klerk sat next to one another during du plessis 
budget speech wednesday and exchanged a few words 
botha 73 resigned as party leader feb 2 and was succeeded by 
de klerk 52 botha said he wanted to distance the presidency from 
partisan politics so he could be more of a symbol of national unity 
but the caucus announced monday that it wanted the party leader to 
be head of state 
the caucus has no formal means of forcing botha out of the 
presidency barring evidence of misconduct or incapacity which could 
prompt impeachment proceedings 
botha has the option of remaining in office against the wishes of 
his party or deciding on his own to step aside from the government 
which he has led since 1978 
the power struggle intensified sunday when botha arranged an 
interview with the statecontrolled television network and said he 
would not call an early election this year 
the next election does not have to be held until march 1990 
bothas statement made without consulting party leaders quashed 
hopes that he would retire in the next few months in conjunction 
with an early election 
some national party officials have suggested that botha might 
agree to yield policymaking power to de klerk while remaining in 
office until next year other political observers have predicted 
botha will aggressively resist any concessions 
there has been little public support for botha during the 
showdown 
botha and de klerk appear to agree on most major policy issues 
however de klerk has been depicted as more pragmatic and 
openminded than botha and more likely to accelerate the pace of 
political change 
a new man would be forced to do new things said the 
sowetan the countrys largest black daily newspaper in an 
editorial tuesday urging botha to retire 
under the countrys apartheid system its 28 million blacks have 
no vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the 
economy and maintain separate districts schools and health services

a judge indicted an army major 
and a second lieutenant on murder charges wednesday in the massacre 
of 10 peasant farmers 
the action against military officers by a civilian judge was 
unprecedented security forces have been blamed for the torture and 
death of thousands of civilians during a 9yearold civil war but 
maj mauricio beltran and 2nd lt arnaldo vasquez became the first 
officers to be indicted by the civilian authority for killing 
salvadoran citizens 
judge alcides guandique also indicted seven soldiers for their 
alleged role in the slayings six months ago 
beltran has denied any role in the killings and contended the 
case has been politicized i had nothing against those people i 
did not even know them he has said 
the indictments followed heavy pressure from the united states 
which provides most of the governments funds and had told officials 
that the army could no longer be allowed to kill civilians with 
impunity 
the indictments came in an atmosphere of rising violence only 
four days before a presidential election sunday during which 
salvadorans for the first time have a chance to dump an incumbent 
civilian government 
leftist guerrillas have threatened election workers and launched 
attacks to prevent people from voting 
the massacre took place sept 21 about 10 miles north of san 
sebastian in the hamlet of san francisco according to the 
indictments troopers of the jiboa battalion under beltrans command 
rounded up seven men and three woman and killed them with explosives 
and gunfire 
asked why beltran might have ordered the captives killed 
guandique said psychosis of war 
guandique 33 conducted a patient investigation that eventually 
disproved armed forces versions of the massacre he handed down the 
indictments in his office in san sebastian 30 miles east of san 
salvador 
the armed forces on sunday in another unprecedented step 
admitted responsibility they had always denied involvement and 
they still deny involvement in a wave of death squad killings in the 
early 1980s 
leftist guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front who are fighting the ussupported government have also 
murdered civilians but human rights groups say the rebels have 
slain far fewer noncombatants than soldiers or death squads linked 
to military units 
with guandiques indictment and decree of detention beltran and 
vasquez also became the first officers in salvadoran history to be 
jailed on the order of a civilian judge 
the accused are likely to stand trial before a jury of five in 
the coming months guandique said he said charges could be dropped 
against some of the defendants if new evidence exonerates them but 
that beltran had been implicated by many witnesses 
beltran and vasquez are being held at military garrisons said 
the judge but will be moved to a police facility pending trial 
lt manuel galvez second in command on the day of the killings 
broke the case open last week with testimony that beltran ordered 
the 10 people killed 
galvez said he refused to carry out the order and 12 soldiers 
backed him up with sworn testimony said guandique galvez who had 
been held with beltran and vasquez by military authorities was not 
indicted and will soon be freed 
the incident began when about three dozen jiboa troopers marched 
into san francisco and began rounding up the villagers the soldiers 
reportedly found rebel arms and mines in at least one house 
the day after the killings the villagers told the associated 
press that about 45 of them had been herded into the small 
schoolhouse the troopers working from a list separated the 10 
victims and marched them away 
guandique citing testimony from galvez and the soldiers said 
beltran ordered the captured mines to be placed along a path and 
detonated as the detainees were marched past but the devices did 
not explode on the first try 
several soldiers surrounded the prisoners and held them in place 
while another trooper fetched a new battery to detonate the mines 
guandique said 
the mines were finally detonated killing or wounding all the 
prisoners who were then riddled with rifle fire and dispatched with 
a shot to the head guandique said 
guandique quoted galvez and others as saying beltran also ordered 
the schoolhouse to be mined and blown up but he was either 
dissuaded or desisted when subordinates balked 
it could have been 50 people instead of 10 guandique said

a federal judge making a personal plea during 
an extraordinary appearance on the senate floor urged senators 
wednesday to throw out impeachment charges that he plotted to get a 
150000 bribe and lied about it at his trial 
saying a jury has acquitted him district judge alcee l hastings 
of miami told senators the jury system is the cornerstone of 
justice in america and to tamper with it lightly is to send a 
message that is both pernicious and dangerous 
many senators sat in silence listening to the 52yearold first 
black federal judge in florida history as he made his appeal 
the proceeding was held only to hear the plea by hastings for 
dismissal of 16 of the 17 articles of impeachment approved aug 3 by 
a house vote of 4133 
the senate planned to wait until thursday to rule on hastings 
motion to dismiss evidence in the case is set to be heard later by 
a special senate committee 
hastings called on the senators to dismiss charges that he 
conspired with attorney william borders to obtain a payoff and then 
committed perjury at his 1983 trial which ended in acquittal 
he was not seeking dismissal of the charge that he disclosed 
secret wiretap information and thus torpedoed a federal 
investigation but he did deny that he had done so 
standing in the well of the senate hastings recalled in a firm 
voice how he had fought the charges against him at his trial 
i proclaimed my innocence then as i have from the outset and as 
i do now hastings said he said that when the jury delivered its 
verdict after 17 hours of deliberations each of the jurors stood and 
said not guilty 
five years of postacquittal investigation has produced no new 
evidence that wasnt available to the prosecution hastings said 
house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks dtexas urged 
the senate to proceed with the impeachment declaring that hastings 
had conspired to sell his public office for personal gain 
he subverted our judicial process by repeatedly lying under 
oath brooks told the senate today judge hastings asks you to 
ignore his corrupt conduct in doing so he asks you to rely on 
a tainted jury verdict 
brooks also read a statement from absent rep john conyers 
dmich a leading house proponent of civil rights on the house 
judiciary committee 
the conyers statement said the evidence established that alcee 
hastings did in fact commit high crimes and misdemeanors which 
justify his impeachment 
we did not wage the civil rights struggle simply to replace one 
form of judicial corruption with another the conyers statement 
said 
the proceeding is not the same as a criminal trial in a court if 
convicted hastings would remain free but would be removed from the 
bench and denied his 89500 annual salary 
according to the charges hastings plotted with borders in 1981 
to obtain a 150000 bribe from two brothers frank and tom romano 
convicted of skimming from a teamsters pension fund loan 
prosecutors say that in return hastings was planning to wipe out 
threeyear sentences he had imposed on the brothers he also 
allegedly was prepared to restore more than 1 million forfeited by 
the brothers 
borders a prominent washington criminal lawyer was convicted in 
a separate trial and sentenced to five years in prison his appeals 
failed 
the romano brothers both of whom have since died never took 
part in the alleged bribe conspiracy they were offered a chance to 
do so and made it clear that they were uninterested their refusal 
complicated matters for the fbi which already had borders under 
investigation 
to keep the investigation alive retired fbi agent h paul rico 
posed as frank romano and agreed to pay the bribe prosecutors say 
borders was arrested oct 9 1981 as he drove out of a suburban 
virginia parking lot with rico and with a garment bag packed with 
125000 in cash 
fbi agents arrested hastings in miami that night

the communist party received more letters critical 
of politburo member yegor k ligachev a conservative counterweight 
to president mikhail s gorbachev than any other soviet leaders 
tass indicated wednesday 
the letters were received in connection with the election 
campaigns of ligachev gorbachev and other top party officials for 
posts in the nations new parliament the official news agency said 
valentin koptyug chairman of the partys electoral commission 
made the letters public as the partys policymaking central 
committee met to discuss agricultural policy and choose its 
representatives to the parliament 
the communist party is one of 30 organizations with the power to 
choose onethird of the 2250 representatives in the new congress of 
peoples deputies the 100 deputies elected by the party in a secret 
ballot include most members of the 12man ruling politburo 26 
workers and seven collective farmers tass reported 
it said 25 letters sent to the electoral commission voiced 
disagreement with some ideas voiced by central committee secretary 
and politburo member yegor ligachev at the 19th national party 
conference last summer 
tass did not provide details of the letters 
at a july 1 session of the conference ligachev said that with 
all the criticism of events in the soviet past achievements had 
been ignored and truth is often completely distorted 
ligachev 68 held the important post of ideology secretary 
making him no 2 in the leadership structure after gorbachev until 
sept 30 when he was shifted to a job with apparently less clout 
head of a new party commission on agriculture 
three letters criticized gorbachev tass quoted koptyug as saying 
the party leader was blamed for the current situation in the 
country because he was a member of the party leadership in the years 
preceding the perestroika or restructuring drive tass said 
gorbachev 58 was named to the politburo in 1979 during the 
rule of leonid i brezhnev an era now condemned as a period of 
stagnation 
tass said that of the other letters criticizing politburo 
members nine were about moscow party chief lev zaikov and two were 
about gorbachev ally alexander yakovlev

the bush administration has no plans to curtail 
sales of semiautomatic assault guns that are produced in the united 
states even while suspending imports of similar weapons the white 
house said wednesday 
furthermore president bush despite the move against imports 
announced tuesday still does not support a ban on the weapons 
themselves his press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
fitzwater was asked by reporters if the president would expand 
the review of the uses of the weapons to domestic models 
there are no plans of that kind anticipated he said 
right now we dont see any need for any review or any other 
changes at all he said the problem of imports was highlighted in 
discussions between bushs new drug policy coordinator william 
bennett and stephen higgins director of the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms 
it did prompt a review of them at this point we are not 
willing to extend that fitzwater said 
several domestic models perform the same functions and have the 
same characteristics as the imported models affected by tuesdays 
suspension one us manufacturer colt on wednesday announced a 
voluntary suspension of sales of its ar15 a civilian version of the 
militarys 223caliber m16 
the weapons have prompted growing public concern especially with 
regard to their proliferation and use in drugrelated street 
violence 
the california state legislature has acted to ban a wide range of 
semiautomatic weapons in the wake of a schoolyard shooting spree in 
january in which patrick edward purdy killed five stockton children 
with a chinesemade ak47 he then killed himself 
the administrations suspension of imports pending a review of 
their uses in the united states will affect some 110000 weapons 
bennett said including akstype firearms such as ak47s uzi 
carbines fnfal and fnfnctype weapons and steyr aug semiautomatic 
weapons 
fitzwater stopped short of completely ruling out action on the 
domestically produced weapons 
were not going through and changing everything thats not 
warranted were just saying heres an issue thats come to light 
we need to deal with this and then well see where we go he said 
while the move against imports is seen as a softening of bushs 
longstanding opposition to gun controls and a potential sore spot 
with his fellow national rifle association members fitzwater 
contended bush was not making a new policy 
the administration suspended the imports using existing law that 
allows import of the semiautomatics only if they are for sporting 
use 
the next step is to find out if they are being used in other ways 
fitzwater sidestepped numerous questions about why the use of 
imports needs to be reviewed when domestic weapons are not reviewed 
while saying there has been no change in bushs position 
fitzwater also expanded the presidents position beyond what bush 
told reporters when the question first arose last month 
bush had said at that time he would strongly oppose a ban on 
semiautomatics in subsequent remarks he said he was concerned about 
the problem and had asked bennett to come up with suggestions to 
deal with it and still do whats right by the sportsman 
fitzwater said wednesday that the presidents original position 
was that he does not favor banning the wepaons that are used by 
sportsmen and are in compliance with the law 
he has said initially that he did not belive in banning these 
guns until we looked into it he was concerned about the problem 
vice president dan quayle told the associated press he received 
several inquiries from people concerned about the administration 
action 
he declined to elaborate but said bush was absolutely right to 
enforce the existing regulations we have i see it as a serious 
attempt by president bush to review the situation

in a flagdecked ceremony on the white house 
south lawn president bush on wednesday marked the evolution of the 
old veterans administration into the new department of veterans 
affairs after swearing in a former army private to lead it 
i consider the new department to have a vital mission it is so 
vital there is only one place for the veterans of america in the 
cabinet room with the president of the united states bush told 
several hundred guests with the new secretary edward j derwinski 
by his side 
on the podium with derwinski was a former constituent he called 
the friend of the gi pulitzer prizewinning cartoonist bill 
mauldin of the chicago suntimes creator of the bedraggled willie 
and joe characters of world war ii 
derwinski a 12term illinois congressman who filled high state 
department posts in the reagan administration was sworn in by the 
president in a private ceremony in the roosevelt room his wife 
bonnie and children michael and maureen accompanied him 
the new secretary said americans thought of veterans in terms 
immortalized by rudyard kiplings tribute to the british tommy 
for its tommy this an tommy that an chuck im out the 
brute 
but its saviour of is country when the guns begin to 
shoot 
in praising derwinski as uniquely suited to lead the new 
department bush said he has the skill of a seasoned legislator 
the patience of a practical administrator the finesse of a diplomat 
and the heart of a man who knows what it means to start his 
government career as a private in the united states army 
the 62yearold derwinski served in the occupation of japan in 
19451946 
bush said that if he does his job well as president our armed 
forces will be so strong and our diplomacy so wise that we will 
never again need to erect another monument to the casualties of 
war and the resulting peace will be the truest monument to our 
veterans 
the audience many in the colored garrison caps of veterans 
organizations pledged allegiance to the flag at the beginning of 
the ceremony the first time it was remembered being done in the 
bush white house bush was a vigorous defender of the pledge during 
the fall campaign often attacking michael dukakis veto as 
massachusetts governor of a bill requiring public school teachers to 
lead the pledge each day 
for years the veterans organizations sought the status and clout 
they thought cabinet status would bring but the general reluctance 
of congress and administrations to multiply cabinet departments 
prevented the change until president reagans electionyear 
conversion last year a study by the national academy of public 
administration said greater influence was by no means certain 
it is the secondlargest government agency with more than 
240000 employees formed in 1930 out of programs administered by 
several departments it expects to keep using its old short name 
va 
derwinski has been warning his constituencies and congressional 
committees for weeks that when budget deficits have to come down 
his budgetary influence is uncertain he repeated that warning 
wednesday this isnt the worlds best time in washington for 
matters involving the budget 
his department spends 298 billion a year and has budgeted 108 
billion for the nations largest medical care system the 172 
hospitals and hundreds of clinics nursing homes and other 
facilities operated by the va 
officials have said their medical system will be 600 million 
short this year forcing delays in care for veterans with problems 
not arising from their service 
derwinski has won approval in principle to submit a request for a 
supplemental appropriation for 300 million but warned in an 
interview earlier this week we dont have the official office of 
management and budget blessing 
there was no sign of such a blessing in wednesdays speeches 
but derwinskis willingness to fight for it has impressed the 
veterans groups as exactly what they wanted jim hanson spokesman 
for the american legion said one thing that impressed most of us 
was that before he was confirmed even he went over and asked for 
more money i dont know that anybodys ever done that before 
one of the audience charles hohenstein of veterans of foreign 
wars post 9619 in morningside md said its a little too early 
to say whether the new department will carry more weight but i 
hope it does 
the departments pension and benefit programs spend more than 17 
billion a year and include the nations fifth largest life insurance 
system and loan guarantees for 12 million homeowners in all a 
third of the population is a potential client of the agency either 
as one of 27 million veterans or as a dependent of one

americans are donating livers hearts and other 
organs with growing frequency national transplant network officials 
said wednesday after analyzing data covering 15 months 
organ donation is really steadily increasing said dr 
william k vaughn director of technical services for the united 
network for organ sharing in richmond va 
despite the gains particularly in liver donations such organs 
are still in critically short supply because as transplant 
techniques advance more patients are added to waiting lists for 
organs 
a record 16792 people were awaiting transplants in the united 
states as of monday the vast majority of them in need of kidneys 
said network spokeswoman kelle straw 
in 1987 the latest year for which figures are available 8967 
kidneys were transplanted nationwide along with 1438 hearts 1199 
livers 142 pancreata and 41 heartlung combinations ms straw 
said the number of kidney pancreas and heartlung transplants was 
down slightly from the previous year while the number of heart and 
liver transplants was up 
people may look at these figures and say well fine within a 
couple of years you should wipe everybody out waiting they dont 
realize its an evolving list she said 
the findings contradict earlier reports that donations were down 
during the first half of 1988 vaughn said those reports were valid 
at the time because organ donation is cyclical 
in the winter months donation is down and it picks up in the 
spring he said its really high in the summer the most 
common time for accidents that leave victims braindead and their 
other organs intact 
the largest gain during the 15month period was in liver 
donation vaughn said he estimated 160 livers were donated in 
december 1988 the last month studied up from 118 in october 1987 
the first month studied 
heart donations climbed from an estimated 170 to 200 a month 
during the same period kidney donations jumped from an estimated 
595 to 660 a month while pancreas donations rose from an estimated 
36 to more than 50 a month 
the estimates are based on an analysis of seasonal and other 
trends in data collected by the network from the nations 72 organ 
procurement agencies vaughn said only donated livers hearts 
kidneys and pancreata were charted 
the united network for organ sharing known as unos began 
compiling the information in october 1987 when federal guidelines 
took effect for doling out scarce organs 
at the same time transplant centers and organ procurement 
agencies began participating in the national organ transplantation 
network and the national organ transplantation scientific registry 
both computerized services administered by unos under contracts with 
the us department of health and human services 
we cant compare prior to that time no one has any data 
vaughn said 
the figures do not represent the number of transplant operations 
because some donated organs were discarded as unsuitable vaughn 
said 
network officials did not attempt to characterize the donors or 
learn what prompted the families charity

the main church of the ruling 
afrikaners on wednesday said it would not support resistance to 
apartheid a decision almost certain to widen a split with its black 
and mixedrace sister churches 
the white branch of the dutch reformed church also placed 
qualifications on a statement it made last week declaring apartheid 
a sin and heresy 
the black and mixedrace churches last week prepared documents 
calling for civil disobedience and outspoken opposition to apartheid 
and presented them to the white church 
the white churchs general synodical commission a highlevel 
policymaking body on wednesday named a committee to study the 
apartheid issue further before taking a position said pierre 
rossouw the churchs chief executive 
these are important and sensitive matters and we want to 
consider them carefully rossouw said 
with about 1 million adult members the white dutch reformed 
church is the largest and most influential denomination among south 
africas 3 million afrikaners president pw botha and most members 
of his cabinet and parliament are among its congregants 
the black dutch reformed church has 11 million members and the 
mixedrace branch 680000 congregants 
the churchs reluctance to become directly involved in opposing 
apartheid is virtually certain to damage its already fragile 
relations with black and mixedrace branches 
the position of the white dutch reformed church is very sad 
said rev nico smith one of the few white ministers who belong to 
the black church the white church is rapidly becoming irrelevant 
to whats happening in south africa 
the black and mixedrace churches include some of the countrys 
best known antiapartheid campaigners such as rev allan boesak and 
rev beyers naude 
leaders of all three churches met last week and the white church 
declared for the first time that apartheid was a sin and asked 
forgiveness for its longtime support of racial segregation 
we confess with humility and sorrow the participation of our 
church in the introduction and legitimation of the ideology of 
apartheid and the subsequent suffering of people the delegation 
from the white church said 
but the synod on wednesday gave only a tepid endorsement of that 
statement noting it did not carry the weight of an official church 
treaty and should be understood in terms of previous church policy 
the synod specifically referred to a 1986 document that said 
apartheid was a mistake but stopped short of calling it a sin or a 
heresy 
boesak said the white church commission must at least call for 
the lifting of the countrys 33monthold state of emergency and the 
release of all detainees held without charge 
if they cant do these things they will seriously jeopardize 
our relationship and their integrity will be seriously in 
question boesak said monday 
the dutch reformed church provided the scriptural justification 
for apartheid when the governing national party came to power in 
1948 and began codifying racial segregation 
under apartheid south africas 28 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

tens of thousands of hungarians took to 
the streets wednesday to celebrate new freedoms in one of the 
biggest displays of nationalist sentiment since the antisoviet 
revolt of 1956 
masses of people dressed in the national colors of red white and 
green and precommunist coats of arms swarmed for hours through 
central budapest 
it was the first time in 41 years communist officials made a 
public legal holiday of the march 15 anniversary of hungarys 
unsuccessful revolt against austria in 1848 
police did not interfere with the events which included an 
unofficial rally organized by 31 independent groups 
an estimated 50000 people jammed the square in front of 
hungarian state television offices for that rally a 12point 
declaration calling for more freedom and independence was read and 
the throng moved to parliament chanting democracy democracy 
not only should march 15 be a day of freedom but the 16th 
17th 18th and all the other days of the year shouted independent 
activist denes csegeny outside the television building 
the 12point declaration included demands for free elections a 
multiparty system freedom of speech and press the withdrawal of 
soviet troops and a neutral and independent hungary 
a call for a public holiday on oct 23 the anniversary of the 
start of the 1956 revolt crushed by the red army was greeted with 
especially loud applause 
march 15 and oct 23 are the holy days of the hungarian 
people imre necs who participated in the revolt told the crowd 
jubilant crowds roved through the city singing national songs 
they also recognized the efforts of other east block nations to gain 
more freedoms 
one huge banner reading 56 68 81 and the national flags of 
hungary czechoslovakia and poland recalled the violent suppression 
of reforms in the countries in those years 
at an official rally attended by 60000 leading communist party 
reformer rezsoe nyers criticized what he said were attempts by late 
soviet president leonid i brezhnev to choke reform in eastern 
europe after 1968 
the soviets led a warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia that 
year to crush communistled reforms similar reforms then were 
stifled in hungary 
the hungarian government has increasingly accepted independent 
political groups in recent months and leaders of the smallholders 
party and the social democrats shared the rostrum with nyers 
he drew applause when he charged that the kremlin largely decided 
hungarian policy from 1948 to 1956 
dissident groups have staged unofficial anticommunist rallies on 
march 15 since the early 1970s but in 1986 riot police brutally 
dispersed crowds that gathered for that years events 
independent groups that staged wednesdays unofficial rally in 
budapest refused to celebrate with the ccommunists arguing that 
party members were responsible for past suppression of independent 
rallies 
but csengey said the separate celebrations did not mean the 
independent groups would not work with the communists for reforms 
communist party reformer imre pozsgay made similar comments in a 
speech at a joint celebration of party and independent groups in 
gyoer in western hungary

congressional negotiators warned wednesday that 
their budget talks with the white house wont be resolved quickly 
house majority leader thomas foley said the discussions could 
cause congress to miss its april 15 deadline for approving a fiscal 
1990 budget resolution 
i do not expect this to move very fast foley dwash who 
was attending the talks that resumed on capitol hill it has to 
move over a period of time its a gradual process 
what we would like to do is meet the april 15 date for a budget 
resolution he said but that often has not been possible and 
a may 15 completion of a fiscal 1990 budget might be more realistic 
he said 
an agreement by march 23 when the negotiating group is scheduled 
to report back to president bush and the house and senate 
leadership would be very early he said 
foley attended the closeddoor talks with white house budget 
director richard darman the chairmen of the house and senate budget 
committees and the senior republicans from those panels 
on thursday top lawmakers from the house and senate committees 
in charge of taxes and entitlements will join the talks 
simply because we meet with the taxwriting committees does not 
in and of itself indicate we are discussing extensive taxes said 
sen jim sasser dtenn the senate budget chairman 
the negotiators were trying to learn whats realistic by way of 
spending restraints or what might be realistic by way of revenue 
enhancements and then go on to judgement further on down the 
line he said 
its not something thats gonig to be resolved in a matter of 
two or three days he said 
we havent really begun what i would call serious 
negotiating said darman who said the group was making no 
decisions on anything 
i would be very surprised if decisions are made as we go along 
i think that the way these things work or dont work is you agree at 
the end on a package and its unlikely that you get specific 
decisions made separately along the way 
wednesdays session included a review of the spending initiatives 
bush included in the 116 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1990 
which he proposed feb 9 
however at a white house meeting tuesday with bush and 
congressional leaders it was agreed the talks will not aim for 
agreement on any specific policies instead they agreed the talks 
will aim for an overall balance between entitlements other domestic 
programs military spending and foreign aid and the amount of new 
government revenue that will be raised 
the talks will also focus first on only fiscal 1990 although 
lawmakers and the administration have said it would be desirable to 
achieve a twoyear pact 
for fiscal 1990 the grammrudman law calls for reducing the 
deficit to 100 billion both democrats and republicans agree that 
goal can be met without a tax increase but many democrats contend 
the fiscal 1991 target of 64 billion cant reached without new 
taxes 
i myself think it is going to be much easier to reach agreement 
on fiscal year 1990 than it is on fiscal year 1991 sasser said 
wednesday without ruling it out 
the negotiators wednesday laid out a schedule for discussing 
taxes and entitlements on thursday discretionary spending on 
friday and defense spending next monday

a senior un official said wednesday he is 
optimistic a plan to stem the exodus of refugees from vietnam will 
win approval at a special unsponsored conference in june 
sergio vieira de mello director for asia in the office of the 
un high commissioner for refugees made the comment while 
outlining the plan endorsed at a meeting last week in malaysia 
one aim of the proposal is to deter vietnamese boat people by 
making them think twice about risking their lives he said 
referring to reports of piracy on the high seas 
last year more than 45000 boat people landed in southeast asian 
countries compared with fewer than 30000 in 1987 
under the plan emigres from vietnam will no longer be 
automatically granted refugee status as of march 14 only those who 
flee persecution are eligible for asylum and permanent resettlement 
others who leave the country for economic reasons will be 
encouraged to return said de mello at the same time he said 
efforts will be made to increase awareness among potential 
emigrants in vietnam of the dangers they risk leaving the country 
illegally 
along certain coasts the pushoff policy or in more 
diplomatic terms the redirection of boats to other countries is 
practically systematic he noted 
in addition there is to be a campaign to stress the advantages of 
the 10yearold orderly departure program under which 23000 
people were flown out of of vietnam last year most of them for 
resettlement in the united states and australia 
de mello said that figure is expected to double this year 
negotiations are also under way to include in the program former 
detainees of vietnamese reeducation camps de mello said that by 
un standards these people would have a legitimate claim to the 
status of refugees 
the plan was endorsed last week by representatives from southeast 
asian countries china and the soviet union an international 
conference to approve it is tentatively scheduled june 13 and 14 in 
geneva 
china granted asylum to about 280000 ethnic chinese who fled 
northern vietnam in the late 1970s when relations between the two 
communist neighbors deteriorated many have been resettled on state 
farms in southern china but have complained of hardship and 
discrimination 
in hong kong on wednesday about 150 vietnamese refugees who fled 
to the british colony after being resettled in china staged a 
demonstration to protest plans to send them back to china a 
government spokesman said 
the vietnamese at the green island center climbed onto a 
dormitory roof and shouted slogans protesting repatriation said 
gordon tam a spokesman for the correctional services department 
one vietnamese woman fell from the roof and was hospitalized 
according to tam who said he had no information on her condition

a close wednesday as millions of workers ignored the call by two 
leftist labor federations to stop work in latin americas largest

governmentimposed wage freeze 
in sao paulo south americas biggest city the subway and 
commuter train service operated normally about 1500 of the citys

to only 800 on the first day of the strike but the 3500 buses 
owned and operated by the city remained idle

iran called on moslem officials 
attending a conference here wednesday to support irans decision to 
break relations with britain and call for the execution of author 
salman rushdie 
but the saudi arabian foreign minister who is chairman of the 
46member organization of islamic conference said he believed the 
organization would only denounce rushdie and his book the satanic 
verses 
iran was honored to have broken ties with the leader of the 
plot mohammad taskhiri head of irans delegation said referring 
to britain in a speech at the foreign ministers conference 
taskhiri urged all islamic governments to stand united against 
what he described as these mean attempts to offend the image of 
the prophet mohammed his wives and daughters 
if we are silent now the west will make a film and then a 
video of the satanic verses he said 
we demand that the punishment decreed by allah be meted out on 
that apostate rushdie we also demand that all islamic countries 
boycott britain culturally and if that doesnt work then 
politically and economically 
the punishment taskhiri referred to was a fatwa or religious 
ruling issued by the iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
ordering rushdies execution for blasphemy 
iranian clerics later offered up to 52 million to anyone who 
killed the 41yearold author who was born into a moslem family in 
india but who later moved to britain where he has been under 
police guard since the death threat 
the saudi arabian foreign minister prince saud alfaisal told 
reporters 
the conference examined the insufferable affronts and 
distortions of islam in rushdies book which has been strongly 
condemned and denounced 
he indicated the conference could not condone irans order to 
kill rushdie and punish britain for protecting him 
he said the conference attaches great importance to the spirit 
of harmony between all world civilizations and countries 
in rushdies novel the archangel gabriel is depicted as an 
indian movie star a scribe claims he altered the words of the holy 
koran considered the word of god without the prophet noticing 
and a whorehouse triples its business when its 12 women take on the 
identities of the prophets wives 
at least 19 people have been killed in antirushdie protests in 
pakistan and india and the book has been banned in those countries 
and others including egypt south africa and bangladesh 
in peshawar pakistan on wednesday a bomb exploded and tore a 
twofoot hole in the roof of a british council library a library 
official linked the blast in which no one was hurt to moslem 
outrage over rushdies novel 
sudan announced wednesday it was banning all books written by 
rushdie or issued by his publisher viking penguin 
in an interview earlier wednesday taskhiri insisted that rushdie 
be judged according to the sharia or koranic law which he said 
requires the death sentence for blasphemy that would be the end 
of our request taskhiri said it is impossible for iran to 
change its basic position on the issue 
conference sources speaking on condition of anonymity said most 
delegates follow another interpretation of the sharia insisting 
that anyone accused of blasphemy be given a fair trial and an 
oppportunity to repent 
islamic theologians meeting in mecca saudi arabia the holiest 
shrine of islam issued a declaration tuesday supporting that 
interpretation 
several delegates were trying to work out a compromise between 
iran and the more liberal group led by saudi arabia the sources 
said

youll all be amused to learn that the memos you get from your 
bosses are probably going to end up as toilet paper kirsten 
svare spokeswoman for the department of streets and sanitation 
said at training sessions for city hall employees 
at the sessions which ended wednesday employees were shown 
slides of the papers uses including paper towels and toilet paper 
ms svare said 
everybody laughed she said its a great laugh 
the city will collect the millions of miles of paper produced in 
city hall and sell it to recycling services inc officials said 
the company will then sell the recycled raw material to paper 
mills across the country to turn it into useable paper products 
officials said 
most of it is going to be turned into toilet paper ms svare 
said in a telephone interview we dont know where the toilet 
paper is going to end up it could end up in your bathroom 
at an average cost of 40 per ton for pickup of office trash

the storm of protest and debate sparked by an 
american flag displayed on the floor at a student art exhibit has 
become part of the work as spectators record their opinions in 
ledgers inviting comment 
the exhibit at the school of the art institute closes thursday 
but the disputed piece what is the proper way to display the us 
flag remained a work in progress wednesday as visitors scribbled 
words of anger or encouragement in the blank books 
in its four weeks on display the work by dread scott tyler 
24 has triggered veterans protests debate on capitol hill 
censure by the state house and a lawsuit dismissed by a circuit 
judge who upheld the schools right to display it 
some samples among the hundreds of opinions most unsigned that 
have been logged in the three ledgers that sit on a wall shelf above 
the flag 
you should be put on the floor and walked on 
good work at provoking a reaction thats what art is supposed 
to do 
dont tread on me 
this took guts if you believe in what you did good for you 
you skunk my fathers flag was drapped sic over his coffin 
 
its only a piece of cloth the idea behind it is good or bad 
i think this is a lot of fuss over nothing 
other countries will see us defacing our flag they will think 
we are weak 
but you got people to think and thats what art is for 
watch your back 
one visitor congratulated tyler on enlisting viewers to help 
complete the piece with their comments living history 
another complained about the myopia of visitors who focus on 
tylers work and ignore all the other art in the exhibit which 
featured 66 minoritystudent works mostly paintings 
visitors wednesday were admitted in small groups for security 
reasons and allowed only about 10 minutes at the schools public 
gallery which prompted some grumbling many returned to the end of 
the short line for another look 
a few protesters turned out and proudly held american flags high 
in front of the art institute as security guards sighed with relief 
at the prospect of the exhibits closing thursday afternoon earlier 
demonstrations drew more than 2000 people 
school spokeswoman beth sullivan said the flag is placed on the 
floor every morning beneath a blackandwhite photomontage and the 
shelf containing the ledgers 
during wednesdays visit the flag sat neatly folded on the shelf 
school officials said protesters opposed to the display often 
take the flag off the floor soon after the exhibit opens in the 
morning and it remains on the shelf until a spectator puts it back 
on the floor and that this is all a part of the work 
its an appropriate response to pick it up and fold it and for 
others to take it down again said peter brown the schools vice 
president 
veterans and others opposed to the display contend the flags 
placement on the floor invites visitors to walk on it a claim 
disputed by school officials 
robert mars the art institutes vice president for 
administration successfully pleaded the museums case before the 
chicago park district boards finance committee which decided 
tuesday not to cut off funds for all eight museums in the city 
because of the exhibit 
the bad news is that the flag doesnt mean to the scott tylers 
of this country what it means to so many of us mars told the 
committee the good news is that our system worked the student 
was allowed to make his statement 
tyler has called his work revolutionary and says he had no 
apologies despite death threats he said he and his mother have 
received

the bush administration has no plans to curtail 
sales of semiautomatic assault guns that are produced in the united 
states even while suspending imports of similar weapons the white 
house said wednesday 
furthermore president bush despite the move against imports 
announced tuesday still does not support a ban on the weapons 
themselves his press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
fitzwater was asked by reporters if the president would expand 
the review of the uses of the weapons to domestic models 
there are no plans of that kind anticipated he said 
right now we dont see any need for any review or any other 
changes at all he said the problem of imports was highlighted in 
discussions between bushs new drug policy coordinator william 
bennett and stephen higgins director of the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms 
it did prompt a review of them at this point we are not 
willing to extend that fitzwater said 
several domestic models perform the same functions and have the 
same characteristics as the imported models affected by tuesdays 
suspension one us manufacturer colt industries on wednesday 
announced a voluntary suspension of sales of its ar15 a civilian 
version of the militarys 223caliber m16 
the weapons have prompted growing public concern especially with 
regard to their proliferation and use in drugrelated street 
violence 
the california state legislature has acted to ban a wide range of 
semiautomatic weapons in the wake of a schoolyard shooting spree in 
january in which patrick edward purdy killed five stockton children 
with a chinesemade ak47 he then killed himself 
the administrations suspension of imports pending a review of 
their uses in the united states will affect some 110000 weapons 
bennett said including akstype firearms such as ak47s uzi 
carbines fnfal and fnfnctype weapons and steyr aug semiautomatic 
weapons 
fitzwater stopped short of completely ruling out action on the 
domestically produced weapons 
were not going through and changing everything thats not 
warranted were just saying heres an issue thats come to light 
we need to deal with this and then well see where we go he said 
while the move against imports is seen as a softening of bushs 
longstanding opposition to gun controls and a potential sore spot 
with his fellow national rifle association members fitzwater 
contended bush was not making a new policy 
the administration suspended the imports using existing law that 
allows import of the semiautomatics only if they are for sporting 
use 
the next step is to find out if they are being used in other ways 
fitzwater sidestepped numerous questions about why the use of 
imports needs to be reviewed when domestic weapons are not reviewed 
while saying there has been no change in bushs position 
fitzwater also expanded the presidents position beyond what bush 
told reporters when the question first arose last month 
bush had said at that time he would strongly oppose a ban on 
semiautomatics in subsequent remarks he said he was concerned about 
the problem and had asked bennett to come up with suggestions to 
deal with it and still do whats right by the sportsman 
fitzwater said wednesday that the presidents original position 
was that he does not favor banning the wepaons that are used by 
sportsmen and are in compliance with the law 
he has said initially that he did not belive in banning these 
guns until we looked into it he was concerned about the problem 
vice president dan quayle told the associated press he received 
several inquiries from people concerned about the administration 
action 
he declined to elaborate but said bush was absolutely right to 
enforce the existing regulations we have i see it as a serious 
attempt by president bush to review the situation

judge alcides guandique who 
became the first civilian judge in salvadoran history to indict 
military officers is proud of his peasant farmer roots 
but i knew i didnt want to return to the corn patch to 
milking cows i studied hard because i knew if i didnt pass id 
have to go back to that studying was like vacation for me he 
said 
the 33yearold judge was born in a oneroom mud brick house in 
the village of san pedro in the eastern province of san miguel of 
his six brothers and sisters one is a doctor and three are teachers 
another sister is a mojada in the united states he said 
using the slang for illegal immigrant 
im campesinoborn and proud of it said the slight 
engaging official in an interview he told of how he would go to 
school with blisters on my hands and my face burned by the sun 
after doing chores 
the father of two he credits the sacrifice of our parents 
for his and his siblings success 
guandique set a historic precedent wednesday when he indicted two 
army officers in connection with the september massacre of 10 
peasant farmers in the nearby village of san francisco 
it has taken on international transcendence but to me its 
like any other case some people were killed campesino lives are 
just as valuable as any other lives those who did it must be 
brought to justice regardless of their position or power he said 
the previous judge in san sebastian resigned late last year 
unwilling to assume the risk involved in pursuing the investigation 
several judges have been killed while probing alleged military 
abuses 
of course im afraid guandique said only machines have no 
fear but if i have problems because i equitably apply the law then 
it is not only my problem but the problem of all judges 
arriving from work at his modest home in ilopango a twohour bus 
trip from san sebastian guandique goes first to a hammock and lifts 
out 10monthold baby alcides jr 
and what would you do if they made you a little orphan he 
laughingly asks the wideeyed child in the kind of morbid jest he 
says helps him deal with the strain 
cecilia his wife said i try to give him courage especially 
when his friends tell him to back off to think about his family and 
not get in over his head 
but sometimes the couples resolve fails as they escorted a 
visitor from their home down an alley toward the street guandique 
stopped at the intersection with another narrow alley 
here is the kind of place someone could be waiting for me some 
night he said 
mrs guandique like her husband campesinoborn stoic and 
hearty stood silently in the midday sun with tears brimming in her 
dark eyes

anxious to please the customer with 
convenience if not a good movie a local movie theater on friday 
will take credit cards for advance and sameday ticket purchases and 
for concession stand sales 
the new amc courthouse plaza 8 theater is set to become the first 
theater in the nation in which this method will be tried according 
to the national association of theater owners 
its a great convenience one that customers around the country 
have been asking for said charlie stoessel manager of the 
theater he said the theater will accept visa mastercard and 
discover credit cards 
it was done in england and was a big success stoessel said 
wednesday 
according to the plan a customer can buy tickets over the phone 
or at the theater with a credit card for those who buy their 
tickets in advance there will be a separate window where the 
tickets can be picked up 
moviegoers also can buy food and drinks at the theater by 
purchasing vouchers on their credit card and then cashing them in at 
the concession stand change will be given in cash

millions of pounds of chilean fruit were being 
held wednesday for tests at dockside at ports in philadelphia los 
angeles and miami while us and chilean officials discussed plans 
for assuring the safety of the produce in the wake of a poisoning 
attempt 
in philadelphia where most chilean fruit enters the united 
states food and drug administration officials completed sampling of 
the 362000 crates of grapes and other fruit from the south american 
country 
no further contamination was found beyond the traces of cyanide 
in two seedless red grapes among those sampled at the port in 
philadelphia on sunday the fda said 
this does not however mean the fruit will be released for 
sale at this time the agency said it is being held and 
refrigerated at the dock until the findings and the entire situation 
can be evaluated 
the testing followed a march 2 telephone threat to the us 
embassy in santiago warning that export fruit would be injected with 
cyanide after the contaminated grapes were found the fda warned 
consumers not to eat any chilean fruit and urged stores to take all 
such produce off their shelves which at this time of year includes 
virtually all fresh grapes 
supermarket produce shelves remained empty of chilean fruit and 
many stores posted signs assuring consumers that the fruit on 
display didnt come from chile 
meanwhile us officials met with representatives of the chilean 
government and us fruit importers to develop a plan to 
reestablish the safety and reliability of chilean fruit the fda 
said 
one of the things they will be focusing on in the next day or 
so is trying to come up with a plan to try to do the least economic 
damage to chile and assure the safety of the fruit supply said 
fda spokesman don mclearn 
fda workers inspected about 12000 crates of fruit from the 
almeria star the ship on which the two contaminated grapes were 
found but the remaining 350000 cases on board were put aside in 
cold storage said richard j davis regional director of the fdas 
midatlantic region 
we have not looked at every particular shipment or every 
particular crate of grapes he said we set up a sampling plan 
in the beginning that we thought was adequate to look at this 
product and if there was something there we felt that our sampling 
plan would find it and it did 
inspections were continuing at ports in los angeles and miami 
the fda said 
some ships loaded with chilean fruit however arent coming into 
port but instead are anchoring off shore until some decision is 
made as to how and when the produce will be distributed mclearn 
said

the nuclear regulatory commission responding 
to charges of inadequate security controls told a congressional 
panel wednesday it will take new steps to weed out agency workers 
deemed potential risks 
the nrc said it generally accepted the conclusions of a study by 
the general accounting office that criticized the practice of 
allowing newly hired personnel to start work without security 
clearances and of not reinvestigating all veteran workers the study 
said these practices could jeopardize national security 
the report by the gao which is the investigative arm of the 
congress was released by a house government operations subcommittee 
that requested the study in 1987 
hugh l thompson jr the nrcs deputy executive director for 
nuclear materials safety said that while the agecys personnel 
security system is essentially sound improvements would be 
sought by accepting some of the gaos recommendations 
the key change promised by thompson was to begin regular 
reinvestigations of the roughly 50 percent of employees for whom 
followup checks are not normally conducted the other half of 
employees are reinvestigated every five years the agency previously 
had cited financial reasons for not doing more reinvestigations 
the gao said stricter security controls on nrc employees is 
increasingly important in light of recent spy scandals that showed 
national security was more likely to be jeopardized by insiders 
than by foreign agents or saboteurs 
it is obvious that a substantial tightening is called for at 
the nrc said rep chuck douglas rnh a member of the house 
panel 
thompson took issue with one point in the auditors report he 
said the gao had overstated the frequency of cases in which newly 
hired workers resign or are fired after a belated disclosure of 
personal problems such as drug or alcohol abuse 
the gao report said about 10 percent of newly hired workers since 
1983 left the nrc after background investigations disclosed serious 
personal problems thompson said the correct figure was 05 percent 
mary ann kruslicky a gao group director said later that thompsons 
figure was right but that the main point was that more thorough and 
earlier background checks are needed 
responding to suggestions from members of the subcommittee 
thompson said the nrc will consider checking applicants fingerprint 
records and academic credentials before putting them to work but he 
stressed that it was not practical to wait the 1012 months required 
for a complete background investigation 
nrc believes that without the use of authority to hire 
individuals prior to completion of background investigations the 
agency will not be able to continue to attract highly competent 
technical and support staff of the calibre we have today he said 
thompson acknowledged that 99 percent of newly hired personnel 
start work without security clearances 
the gao said that its review of personnel security files revealed 
several examples of potential security breaches involving workers 
who had not gotten security clearances 
it cited the case of a nuclear reactor engineer who began work 
without a clearance in 1985 the worker required a clearance that 
would grant access to topsecret national security information and 
in the subsequent investigation it was disclosed that the employee 
used heroin and had overdosed on the drug in 1984 the worker 
resigned during a oneyear probation period

passengers aboard a pan am flight to paris were 
warned a caller had claimed a bomb was on the plane but the airline 
said wednesday the caution did not reflect a policy change since the 
explosion of a pan am plane over scotland 
aviation officials said they were not aware of a previous 
instance of an airline warning passengers of a bomb threat only 17 
of the 200 passengers on the plane chose to take another flight 
monday 
pan american spokesman alan loflin said the action had nothing to 
do with criticism for not warning passengers about an anonymous bomb 
threat made against the carrier before flight 103 exploded over 
scotland dec 21 
flight 103 is a whole different situation he said 
the threat called in against mondays flight 114 was unusually 
specific loflin said 
there was never anything that resembled a threat against pan am 
103 this one on 114 was clearly a threat against 114 by number by 
departure city and by destination loflin said 
however a spokesman for a passenger group said the warning 
likely followed pressure over flight 103 on dec 5 an anonymous 
caller to the us embassy in finland warned a bomb would be aboard 
a pan am flight traveling from frankfurt to the united states within 
two weeks government officials later said the call was a hoax 
the information was relayed by the state department to its 
overseas employees and pan am and relatives of some of the 259 
people killed in the crash were critical that passengers had no such 
warning 
i would suspect that the pan am 103 flight in december had 
something to do with the decision to disseminate the information 
said david jeffrey spokesman for airline passengers of america 
were certainly glad to see that the airline took the 
responsibility of relaying the information 
workers checked the plane and luggage while passengers were taken 
to a special room after the crew agreed the plane was safe to fly 
passengers were told of the threat and given the option of taking 
alternate flights the flight was about 1 hours late and arrived in 
paris without incident 
marilyn harding a passenger who switched flights after the 
warning said they werent told until minutes before boarding 
who wants to spend eight hours up there just wondering i think 
those people took a real gamble she said 
the federal aviation administration has no directive on whether 
to tell passengers about threats said agency spokesman fred farrar 
whatever they do is up to them farrar said 
thousands of bomb threats are called into airlines each year but 
virtually all are groundless he said adding that he did not know 
of any previous passenger warnings 
jeffrey said that if all threats were relayed anybody with a 
quarter could throw the whole aviation system out of whack 
but he said the passenger association believes that if the 
threats have been released from security agencies to the general 
public as in the posting of the state department warning the 
public should be told

college costs rose much faster than inflation 
for instate undergraduate students attending state colleges and 
universities with the average hike 63 percent last fall says a 
survey released wednesday 
the 198788 hike surpassed the 198687 boost of 54 percent 
according to the annual survey by the american association of state 
colleges and universities and the national association of state 
universities and landgrant colleges 
the latest increase also outpaced the 1988 inflation rate which 
was 44 percent according to the consumer price index 
the average price of fulltime attendance in fall 1988 including 
tuition fees room and board was 4397 for instate undergrads 
the survey found thats 302 more than they paid in 1987 
the authors said the increasing charges reflect a shifting 
balance in the share of costs paid by students their parents and 
public resources 
as in the past two surveys they said faculty salary increases 
and equipment and facilities replacement or repair are the most 
frequently cited factors in tuition increases other reasons given 
included inflation decreased appropriations and legislative action 
on costs 
the state with the highest rate of increase was oklahoma where 
the legislature has mandated tuition hikes of 15 to 20 percent for 
each of the next four years said aascu spokesman mike mulnix 
its still fairly reasonable the average will be right around 
2000 a year for tuition and fees this year mulnix said but 
percentagewise its a large increase 
on the bright side the survey found that 67 schools held 
instate undergraduate charges constant and 14 actually lowered 
their tuition and fees in 1988 
the declines occurred at four schools in new york three in 
virginia two each in alaska georgia and west virginia and one in 
texas 
charges stayed the same at 22 schools in new york 15 in texas 
seven in mississippi five in alabama four in arkansas two each in 
montana puerto rico idaho and south carolina and one each in 
connecticut georgia minnesota missouri north carolina and 
wisconsin 
the survey was based on questionnaires filled out by 537 public 
colleges and universities results reflect the costs of attending 
about 90 percent of the nations publicly assisted fouryear 
institutions of higher education the study said

recent precipitation and promising forecasts 
show substantial improvement from dry conditions around the 
country as the spring planting season nears but a top federal 
forecaster said wednesday there are still some troubling exceptions 
for prime farmland 
norton d strommen the chief meteorologist at the department of 
agriculture said dry areas with unfavorable forecasts include 
portions of central and western kansas extending into the oklahoma 
and texas panhandles california and the texas gulf coast 
another critically dry pocket of prime farmland covering western 
illinois eastern and southern iowa and northern missouri however 
has good prospects for rain strommen said after a briefing with the 
house agriculture committee 
weve come a long way in terms of improving sil moisture since 
the devastating 1988 drought strommen said the signs are very 
encouraging we will not have that repeated as we approach the 
planting season its a much more encouraging picture than we had 
any reason to hope for 
among trouble spots however are the oklahoma and texas 
panhandles and an area of western kansas where moisture has been 
less than 50 percent of normal throughout the winter months 
strommen said 
he is also concerned about the dryness that has developed along 
the gulf coast particularly in texas and extreme southern florida 
and after a good early season start on the snowpack belt in 
the west there has been a sharp drying out in january and 
february strommen said 
reservoir levels have been drawn down by last summers drought 
and forecasts indicate its doubtful california will see a 
significant addition to its snowpack before the end of the winter 
rainy season in april strommen said 
it is an area of great concern to us at this point they have 
already started to restrict some of the water use patterns in 
california he said 
although this weeks rains were highly beneficial in central 
and northern califoria as far as the winter wheat crop is concerned 
they did not add a lot to the snowpack situation strommen said 
strommen said there is also concern some of the shallower wells 
will not be able to provide adequate water across central portions 
of the country including the oklahoma and texas panhandles 
weve seen an increase in top soil moisture but not enough 
strommen said it is enough now to germinate a crop but it has 
not added to deep soil moisture reserves that means we have not 
increased water table levels 
there is also concern about reservoir levels in the southeast 
strommen said

a famine in northeast mozambique has 
killed almost 5000 people this year and tens of thousands are 
suffering from acute food shortages made worse by a guerrilla war 
the national news agency aim reported wednesday 
catholic missionaries told aim the deaths occurred in memba a 
coastal region about 240 miles south of the border with tanzania 
aim quoted the missionaries as saying tuesday that the toll now 
stood at 4810 
threefourths of the 184000 people in memba face serious food 
shortages according to a representative of radio mozamique in 
northern nampula city 
some of the hardest hit areas are only 30 miles from the busy 
port city of nacala which has an adequate food supply aim reported 
poor transportation and communications systems hampered relief 
operations many people in memba have survived on wild roots and 
fruit since august but the government relief agency did not know 
how bad things were until this year aim reported 
in the past week relief workers have been trying to transport 60 
tons of food to the town of memba each day by road and by boat 
however once the food reaches memba there is no guarantee it will 
make it to those in need because of poor or nonexistent roads aim 
said it said local relief organizations are trying to get 
helicopters to supply some of the more remote villages 
the news agency also said people are moving south to flee 
mozambiques civil war it noted that a widespread migration could 
mean that few crops will be planted this year and the famine could 
get worse 
the 12yearold war pits the marxist government against rebels of 
the mozambique national resistance who have seriously disrupted the 
countrys economy with hitandrun attacks on military and civilian 
targets

the united states and other donor governments 
have settled a threeyear quarrel with latin american nations and 
now are ready to make another 225 billion available to support 
loans in the western hemisphere over the next four years sources 
said wednesday 
agreement was expected to be announced at a meeting of the 
interamerican development bank in amsterdam next week the loans 
would be made through the bank which is owned by 44 countries 
the us treasury which is in charge of the negotiations had no 
comment on the reports a state department official said 
negotiations were still going on 
the reports came after treasury secretary nicholas brady issued a 
proposal last friday for reducing debts to commercial banks to 
which latin american countries owe more than 400 billion 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be named said the 
united states had failed in an attempt to get the right to delay a 
loan for as long as two years a delay which would amount to a veto 
present rules in the interamerican development bank require only 
a 50 percent vote to approve a loan the united states cannot stop 
most loans since it usually has less than 35 percent of the voting 
power 
in 1987 james a baker iii then treasury secretary said the 
bank needed more money but that he wanted to be sure it was well 
used 
the united states is willing to work to secure this funding 
but only if the appropriate checks and balances are adopted and lead 
to improvements in lending quality he told delegates to a meeting 
in miami 
baker is now secretary of state bank president antonio ortiz 
mena a mexican who opposed the changes baker sought has given way 
to enrique v iglesias of uruguay a former highlevel treasury 
official james w conrow has become his deputy 
under the new arrangement a 12month delay would require 40 
percent of the votes on the banks board of directors the sources 
said the united states has 3457 percent of the vote and it counts 
on support from canada which has 438 percent of the vote but 
their 3895 percent total falls just short of the 40 percent hurdle 
in accordance with its voting power the united states would make 
the largest contribution about 78 billion one source said that 
if past arrangements are followed only 45 percent of that about 
350 million actually would have to be paid out over the fouryear 
period the rest of the us contribution and those of other donors 
would only be on call if needed 
in the past such calls have not been made but the assurance that 
they could be enables the bank to borrow cheaply on world markets 
and make its own loans to the american republics on easier terms 
than commercial banks would give 
the interamerican development bank which has its headquarters 
in washington has been lending over 2 billion a year for projects 
to raise living standards most money goes for farm projects with 
large amounts for energy and transport 
since 1961 the largest sums have gone to brazil the third 
worlds largest debtor followed by mexico and argentina of the 17 
donor countries canada is the second largest contributor followed 
by japan and west germany

iran said wednesday that iraq captured 
hundreds of troops during their ceasefire and it denied iraqi 
accusations that iranian troops violated the truce the islamic 
republic news agency reported 
the official iranian news agency monitored in nicosia quoted 
deputy foreign minister mohammad hussein lavasani as saying iraq 
seized 700 troops and a number of civilians since ceasefire began 
in august and ended eight years of fighting 
lavasani said in a note handed to the tehran office of the 
international committee of the red cross that more than six months 
have gone by and there has not been any news on the captivity of 
these individuals the agency said 
he appealed to the swiddbased icrc to secure the immediate 
release of these pows who were taken captive in violation of the 
third geneva convention 
lavasani was quoted as saying iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
promised iraq would release these prisoners in the near future 
during the first round of ceasefire talks in geneva in august 
but this claim had been proven to be a political gesture 
tens of thousands of pows were taken by iran and iraq during the 
persian gulf war the two countries are yet to agree whether the 
pows would be released before or as a part of an overall setlement 
of their conflict 
however both sides have released hundreds of elderly and 
warcrippled prisoners of war 
iran also denied wednesday earlier iraqi accusations that it 
violated the ceasefire irna reported 
it quoted an unnamed source at irans armed forces command 
headquarters as saying the ceasefire was violated by iraqi forces 
late monday night when they shelled three iranian cities across the 
southern border 
the source said iraqi forces opened fire on the city of 
shalamcheh and extended the shelling to the port of khorramshahr 
the iranians did not return fire until the iraqis started shelling

even if mikhail s gorbachevs economic 
reforms succeed the soviet union wont be able to bridge the 
technological gap with the west by the year 2000 said a nato report 
released wednesday 
the report drawn up by us experts said gorbachevs drive to 
restructure the economy will make some progress but not as much as 
the soviets predict 
even if gorbachev wins the gains from new technology and 
enhanced labor productivity will not suffice to narrow the gap with 
the west during the remainder of this century said the report 
prepared for the north atlantic treaty organization 
it also said poor weather could trigger an agricultural failure 
severe enough to exacerbate current consumer dissatisfaction and 
threaten the success of gorbachevs reform effort 
another nato report released wednesday said the failure of 
perestroika to produce major changes gives the kremlin cogent 
reasons to pare the amount of money devoted to defense in its 
fiveyear plan for 1991 to 1995 
barring an unlikely turnaround in the economy it said we 
would expect the pressure to hold down defense spending to continue 
during 199195 
the report noted gorbachevs promises to slash defense spending 
by 142 percent but said no details have been released on where 
those cuts would be made or during what period of time 
it estimated soviet defense expenditures grew at an average 
annual rate of just under 2 percent during 197587 outlays in 1975 
were 90 billion to 95 billion rubles or 145 billion to 153 
billion at the official exchange rate they rose to 110 billion to 
120 billion rubles in 1987 or 178 billion to 194 billion the 
figures were adjusted for inflation 
the analysts said the defense sector was a heavy drain on the 
soviet economy absorbing 15 percent to 17 percent of the gross 
domestic product the total economic output in the mid1980s in 
comparison us defense spending was about 65 percent of economic 
output it said 
the burden of defense falls unevenly across the soviet economy 
and is especially heavy in those civilian sectors where needs are 
greatest if gorbachev is to succeed in modernizing industry it 
said 
military development and production capture a large number of the 
best scientists technologists engineers and skilled technicians 
moreover military facilities have better access to electronic 
components special steels nonferrous metals chemicals and oil 
products it said 
in the economic study analysts used a cia economic model to look 
at three alternatives for growth from 1986 to 2000 
the most positive gorbachev wins projects the stagnant 
economy will pick up to expand at a healthy 29 percent average 
annual rate in the period from 1991 to 2000 to achieve that rate 
reforms would have to be successful and weather conditions good for 
farming 
a gorbachev loses outlook sees the economy expanding at a 
poor 16 percent annually from 1991 to 2000 
a third scenario of gorbachev doesnt matter predicts growth 
of 15 percent annually in that same period

the washington apple commission voted 
unanimously wednesday to spend 17 million for advertising to 
reassure consumers that apples are safe despite nationwide concerns 
over alar use 
the commission which represents growers of the nations largest 
apple crop voted to take 1 million in emergency funds and borrow 
669000 from banks to purchase advertising in major markets around 
the country 
concerns over the suspected carcinogen showed little sign of 
abating as eddie albert and other hollywood entertainers held a news 
conference to urge mothers to demand that their grocers carry 
chemicalfree produce 
the natural resources defense council whose recent report 
touched off the furor warned the apple commission to be careful 
about the content of its advertising 
we assume they are not going to be impugning our integrity 
said paul allen a spokesman for the nonprofit washington 
dcbased environmental group that would be a great mistake on 
their part 
the goal of the nrdc report is not to hurt farmers but to change 
the policies of the us environmental protection agency and make it 
easier to ban certain chemicals allen said 
apple commission spokeswoman vicky scharlau said the advertising 
to begin later this month will seek only to reassure consumers that 
apples are safe and that the present system regulating chemicals is 
effective 
this isnt a war between the apple industry and the nrdc she 
told a packed house of growers at the commission meeting 
the nrdc report released in late february contends that eating 
alartreated apples increases the cancer risk in children the 
report has been attacked as alarmist by the federal environmental 
protection agency and the findings have been disputed by some 
scientists and the apple industry 
but public fears have led school districts across the country 
including those in new york los angeles and chicago to ban apples 
and apple products from cafeterias 
alar is the marketing name for daminozide which is manufactured 
by uniroyal chemical co the industry contends only about 5 percent 
of the crop is sprayed with the growth regulator which keeps apples 
on the tree longer and thus improves color and firmness in red 
varieties and also allows a longer harvest period 
a washington state farmworker group on wednesday sent a letter to 
the apple commission urging the use of less chemicals 
the alar controversy brings to light the concerns farmworkers 
have about pesticides said george finch a director of the 
2800member centro campensino farmworker advocacy group that has 
often spoken out against improper chemical use 
eddie albert and several other actors held a news conference in 
los angeles wednesday on behalf of mothers and others for pesticide 
limits which was founded by actress meryl streep ms streep has 
been a vocal supporter of the nrdc report 
now mothers are angry said albert who was joined by rhea 
perlman pam dawber olivia newtonjohn and thirtysomething 
performers patricia wettig and mel harris 
the washington apple commission which represents growers of the 
nations largest apple crop is hoping to counter that kind of 
publicity with its new advertising campaign 
i hate to borrow money said commissioner ross larson but 
other commissioners argued that the issue was critical and the 
industry had no choice but to respond 
the growerfinanced apple commission has already spent more than 
1 million of its normal 64 million advertising budget in the alar 
fight primarily doing public relations work and purchasing 
fullpage newspaper ads in the past two weeks in 44 of the nations 
largest newspapers 
the new 16 million allocation is in addition to the regular 
advertising budget and the content of the ads has not been 
determined 
washington has onequarter of the nations commercial apple 
growers and produces half the supermarket crop in a normal year 
other advertising campaigns are under way by the international 
apple institute of mclean va and by tree top inc of selah 
wash the largest apple juice processor in the world

a chicago native who moved to the soviet union 
in 1931 said he felt overwhelmed when he arrived in israel 
wednesday ending a 13year struggle to emigrate 
abe stolar 78 landed at tel avivs ben gurion airport with his 
wife son daughterinlaw and two grandchildren 
its all too much to take in at once he told reporters 
stolar and his parents left chicago for the soviet union when he 
was 19 because my parents were communists and they were 
disillusioned with life in the united states during the great 
depression he said my father believed he could help the soviet 
union 
stolar said he was a loyal soviet soldier during world war ii 
but he became fed up with life in his adopted nation after the war 
ended in 1945 
he said he found antisemitism rampant in soviet society and 
believed he was dismissed from a job with radio moscows english 
language division after the war because he is jewish 
i began to read literature about the holocaust and jewish 
history after leaving the radio station stolar said i began 
to identify with the jewish people 
stolar applied for a visa to leave the soviet union in 1974 and 
was granted permission in june 1975 
but as he and his family were about to board a plane to europe 
the kgb stopped them saying stolars wife gita had access to 
state secrets in her job as a chemist at a geology institute 
stolar tried to enlist the support of world leaders in his fight 
to leave the soviet union after he was repeatedly denied another 
emigration visa 
last year president reagan made a personal appeal to soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev for stolars release

interior minister carlos caceres discussed 
proposed constitutional changes wednesday with the opposition in the 
first talks the military government has accepted with its foes in 
five years 
the oppositions chief spokesman patricio aylwin the first such 
leader invited to the government palace under the 15yearold 
military government called his 30minute talk with caceres 
positive 
caceres said some proposals submitted by aylwin for democratic 
changes to the constitution were interesting 
aylwin is president of the centrist christian democratic party 
and spokesman for a 17party opposition coalition he is considered 
a frontrunner to the nomination as the oppositions single 
presidential candidate in the election scheduled for dec 14 
the meeting was part of a series of talks opened tuesday by the 
government with progovernment and opposition politicians to seek an 
agreement on changes to the 1980 militarywritten constitution 
the day before caceres met with sergio jarpa president of the 
rightwing national vanguard party he is scheduled to meet another 
rightwing leader thursday 
president gen augusto pinochet announced saturday in his annual 
stateofthenation message that he is willing to consider some key 
democratic changes sought by dissidents it was the first time the 
73yearold president and army commander accepted such a possibility 
pinochet made clear that his idea is to perfect the 
constitution not to dismantle it he said he would study 
proposals to amend an article banning marxism to shorten the 
present eightyear presidential term and to eliminate the 
presidents emergency power to exile citizens 
the president also said the changes may include adding one 
member probably a civilian to a powerful militarydominated 
national security council and to ease the requirements for future 
constitutional changes 
any constitutional changes would have to be approved in a 
national referendum which government sources say could take place 
next june 
aylwin suggested caceres set up a commission of government and 
opposition constitutional experts to come up with a joint proposal 
for the changes he did not disclose the ministers reaction to his 
proposal 
it was the first highlevel contact between the pinochet 
government and the opposition since an aborted dialogue five years 
ago when the government was shaken by a series of street protests 
that left scores dead 
pinochet took power in a violent 1973 coup that toppled the 
elected government of salvador allende a marxist allende died in 
the takeover

premierdesignate ante markovic a 
reformer and successful businessman announced a trimmer government 
wednesday to carry the battle against yugoslavias worst economic 
crisis since world war ii

outgoing administration of branko mikulic and will be a combination 
of politicians and technocrats he and his government are to be 
sworn in thursday 
parliament approved a 1989 budget wednesday totaling the 
equivalent of 3 billion a 165 percent increase reflecting 
inflation that has reached an annual rate of 346 percent according 
to government figures 
yugoslavias federal budget covers only defense aid to 
underdeveloped regions government salaries and retirement benefits 
all other expenditures are covered in budgets of the six member 
republics 
the economic crisis has caused labor unrest and exacerbated 
problems between ethnic groups in the nations loose federation 
in kosovo an autonomous province that was the heart of ancient 
serbia 2000 miners defied government orders to end a strike that 
began feb 21 about 90 percent of the people in the poor southern

cleanup of contamination and radioactive waste 
at the governments 12state nuclear weapons complex may cost much 
less than the 60 billion to 100 billion commonly estimated energy 
secretary james d watkins told congress wednesday 
i believe we can do this for a lot less watkins told a 
senate budget subcommittee in his first appearance on capitol hill 
since his swearing in last week 
watkins did not make his own estimate but promised to produce 
later this year a detailed blueprint including cost projections 
for an initial fiveyear effort to clean up the weapons sites and 
modernize the aging facilities 
on a related topic watkins disclosed he is seeking to persuade 
the federal aviation administration to reestablish limits on 
airplane flights over the savannah river plant nuclear facility near 
aiken sc which includes three nuclear reactors that produce 
material used in atomic warheads only a voluntary restriction has 
existed since 1976 when aviation authorities ended tighter limits 
weve got to take a look all around the nuclear weapons 
complex for ways of limiting the threat of an air attack watkins 
said 
the energy department in an estimate published before watkins 
took over said modernization and cleanup of the weapons complex 
would cost at leaset 81 billion over the next 21 years the general 
accounting office has put the cost at over 100 billion 
in testimony before the senate panel keith o fultz the gaos 
director of energy issues said current cost estimates probably were 
too low given that no one yet knows how bad some of the 
contamination is and the feasibility of cleanup 
watkins refuted this he said scenarios for accomplishing the 
cleanup often contained gold watches or frills that are too 
expensive and not needed 
watkins also said he was confident his department could safely 
restart the savannah river plant nuclear reactors in south carolina 
which are the nations only source of tritium a radioactive gas 
needed in the manufacture of nuclear warheads the three reactors 
have been closed for nearly a year because of safety concerns 
i believe we can get those reactors up he said adding that 
he planned to meet soon with senior executives of westinghouse 
electric corp which on april 1 takes over for ei du pont de 
nemours amp co as contract manager at savannah river 
the energy department and westinghouse have said they would 
produce a detailed plan for restarting the savannah river reactors 
by the end of this month 
the timing of a restart at savannah river is considered important 
because the shutdown of production there has raised questions about 
the adequacy of us tritium supplies 
watkins said he already was developing a plan that would get the 
savannah river reactors running again and keep them in safe 
operation for at least a decade time enough to allow for the 
construction of a new generation of reactors 
he defended the bush administrations plan for spending 68 
billion to build two new tritiumproducing reactors one at savannah 
river and the other in idaho critics have said only one and 
possible none will be needed in the foreseeable future 
robert b barker the pentagons assistant secretary for atomic 
energy told the panel the two new reactors would be capable of 
producing 150 percent of the nations tritium needs he strongly 
defended the plan saying extra production capacity was needed to 
guard against unforeseen technical or other problems 
watkins rejected suggestions from some public interest groups 
that postponing or cancelling the new reactor projects could serve 
as a basis for negotiating us and soviet limits on production of 
nuclear materials including plutonium 
we arent yet at a point in arms control where we can throw 
away our bargaining chips he said while acknowledging that 
future arms control agreements could leave the united states with 
excess capacity for nuclear materials 
we may have to eat some of the dollars were putting into 
these he said 
he likened the reactor issue to the development and production of 
pershing 2 and groundlaunched tomahawk cruise missiles that cost 
the united states about 10 billion those missiles are now being 
destroyed under terms of the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty although many never were deployed in the field

jewish settlers drove a mobile 
home up a hillside through rain and hail wednesday to stake a new 
settlement in the occupied west bank 
in the occupied gaza strip two teenage palestinian guerrillas 
were captured after they infiltrated from egypt and attacked an 
israeli military outpost with a rifle and grenades they were 
wounded but no troops were hurt the army said 
a handful of religious jewish settlers arrived at talmon a 
hilltop spot 12 miles from jerusalem in the heart of the west bank 
where palestinians have been rebelling against israeli rule for the 
last 15 months 
this place belongs to us said one settler yachanan indech 
25 all this land was mentioned in the bible 
but he said the main importance of the site was strategic 
if it were a clear day you could see the whole city of tel 
aviv from this hilltop without a telescope he said with a 
small weapon you could hit any plane that lands at the 
international airport 
indech said that by the end of the week 12 families with 
children would move to the site 
soldiers were stationed on the hilltop to protect the new 
settlement and the settlers planned to circle the site with coils 
of barbed wire before nightfall 
the jewish activists vowed that seven more of the controversial 
settlements would be established in the occupied territory during 
the next four years as promised by the government 
the united states has said the 130 jewish settlements and 80000 
settlers already in the occupied lands constitute a major stumbling 
block to peace about 17 million arabs live in the territories 
antiisraeli protests continued in the occupied territories and 
at least eight palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with 
troops arab reports and hospital officials said the army said it 
was checking the reports 
since the beginning of the uprising in december 1987 396 
palestinians and 17 israelis have been killed 
the two palestinian infiltrators slipped across the southern 
border before dawn the army said 
a military source who spoke on condition of anonymity said their 
attack failed when a grenade hurled at the military outpost rolled 
back onto the guerrillas position and exploded injuring at least 
one of the arabs soldiers opened fire after hearing an explosion 
the source said 
the guerrillas ages 15 and 17 were wounded and captured the 
army said 
during interrogation the teenagers said they were members of the 
fundamentalist islamic jihad or islamic holy war the army said in 
a statement 
military sources said they were planning to kill soldiers take 
hostages and return to egypt 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai head of israels southern command 
charged that the attack was carried out with the knowledge of plo 
chairman yasser arafat and his fatah guerrillas but without help 
from the egyptians 
according to the terrorists being questioned they went 
with the knowledge of fatah and with the knowledge of abu ammar 
or arafat mordechai said 
he praised the egyptians for helping find the route the 
guerrillas had taken and mounting a search for accomplices 
it was the third foiled guerrilla raid this week following two in 
lebanon it came after us officials reportedly sought to work out 
a ceasefire between israel and the palestine liberation 
organization to stop infiltrations from lebanon 
attempts to arrange a ceasefire were reported by the 
englishlanguage jerusalem post newspaper before foreign minister 
moshe arens left for the united states on march 10 
army officials say at least 30 guerrillas have been killed in 
southern lebanon this year while attempting to cross into israel 
five were killed in the two attempts earlier this week 
the united states has asked the plo to halt such attacks but the 
group has said that raids on military targets were not included when 
arafat renounced terrorism last year

the sale of eastern airlines is an increasingly 
likely option for parent texas air corp as the crippling strike 
against the carrier continues with no sign of resolution experts 
said wednesday 
on the 12th day of a bitter strike by easterns machinists union 
the airline still was operating only a fraction of its normal 
flights most of easterns pilots have continued honoring the strike 
despite appeals and warnings from management making it virtually 
impossible for the airline to expand service 
eastern sought protection from creditors last thursday under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act but financial analysts and 
other observers suggested that texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
would have difficulty rebuilding eastern through chapter 11 and may 
be reaching a point where he is obliged to sell the ailing carrier 
to stem his losses 
the strongest potential buyer remains financier carl icahn the 
owner and chairman of trans world airlines inc according to labor 
and financial sources close to the situation who asked not to be 
identified 
icahn expressed interest in buying eastern last october and the 
machinists said last week that they want him to explore a possible 
buyout by acquiring eastern icahn could use the airlines 
northsouth routes as possible feeders into twas transatlantic 
routes 
another possible buyer is grandview a group of investors and 
former corporate executives the sources said the groups strongest 
suit is said to be management expertise giving it the belief that 
it could negotiate contracts with easterns unions that lorenzo was 
unable to get 
icahn and representatives of grandview did not return phone calls 
seeking comment 
some major airlines also have been rumored to be looking at 
eastern but the stories have been denied by spokesmen for the 
carriers 
easterns value to potential buyers is its assets planes 
airport gates lucrative new yorkflorida routes other carriers 
believe they could deploy them more effectively than lorenzo has 
and thus turn the airline around 
lorenzo who controls eastern through his texas air holding 
company has become a lightning rod for employees anger 
lorenzo has asked his investment bankers at drexel burnham 
lambert inc to gauge potential interest in buying eastern among 
investors and other airlines according to the sources 
although texas air has attempted to gauge buying interest in the 
past the latest development seemed to indicate a more serious 
attempt to find a potential buyer some financial analysts said 
some airline union leaders saw it as a possible admission of 
defeat by lorenzo but they conceded it could be a tactical maneuver 
wed love to see him find a buyer for eastern said jim 
conley a spokesman for the international association of machinists 
at the unions washington headquarters 
drexel declined to confirm that it had been approached by lorenzo 
houstonbased texas air said in a statement texas air has 
dealt with many investment bankers in the past including drexel 
burnham beyond that texas air is only doing what it prudently 
should in exercising its fiduciary responsibility to its 
shareholders and its creditors 
some observers say the pressure on lorenzo to sell the airline 
intensified tuesday when the air line pilots association threw a 
crimp into any eastern effort to sell it piecemeal alpa the 
national pilots union announced that its members would refuse to 
fly eastern routes for a carrier that purchased eastern planes or 
routes unless eastern pilots were hired by that carrier 
alpas executive board also said it had authorized strike benefit 
payments of 2400 a month plus interestfree loans for every 
eastern pilot honoring the machinists picket lines 
the pilots continuing refusal to cross picket lines has 
clearly limited lorenzos options said ron cole a spokesman 
for the eastern pilots union in miami

verses agreed wednesday to allow newspapers to publish up to 750 
words of the novel in an attempt to let readers judge the 
controversy that has touched off moslem vows of vengeance against 
the author 
the american society of newspaper editors had suggested that the 
publisher viking penguin inc make more of the book available for 
publication 
normally publishers permit the publication of no more than 300 
words from a copyrighted work usually in a book review 
but viking agreed that up to 750 words could be published by 
newspapers as long as they give a proper copyright and credit notice 
and on the additional condition that the material always be put 
into proper context as to the overall meaning of the novel 
according to an announcement by viking and asne 
the passages were selected by asne 
asne president john seigenthaler publisher of the nashville 
tennessean and editorial director of usa today said we 
approached viking with the idea that 750 words would give editors an 
opportunity to present passages of the book in the space of an oped 
column after extensive discussions they have concurred 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the spiritual leader of iran said 
last month that rushdies book insulted moslems and said moslems 
everywhere should seek out and kill the author for committing 
unforgiving sins against the religion 
rushdie a briton who was born a moslem went into hiding and 
khomeinis action touched off a worldwide reaction it has been 
denounced throughout the west as a threat to freedom of expression 
and a violation of the rules of civility

the food and drug administrations decision to 
warn consumers against eating chilean fruit was a balance of 
concerns about the economic impact of such a decision and the health 
and safety of americans an agency spokesman said wednesday 
this is a thing of great magnitude said fda spokesman don 
mclearn 
it has great economic potential he said but added you 
only had two grapes and they werent sufficient to do that much 
harm 
however he continued you had a probable confirmation that it 
was a tampering not a hoax and then how far do you go with a 
decision based on that evidence thats very tough 
the decision was made by fda commissioner frank young on monday 
and that evening the agency issued a warning to consumers not to 
eat any fruit from chile and urging stores to remove all chilean 
fruit from their shelves 
the announcement came some 24 hours after fda inspectors 
discovered two suspiciouslooking red grapes that tests later 
confirmed to contain traces of cyanide according to a chronology of 
events as outlined by mclearn 
the saga began march 2 when the us embassy in santiago received 
a call from a spanishspeaking male who threatened to inject cyanide 
into chiles export fruit the message was passed on to the us 
customs service which put out a cable to its field units which 
began detaining ships with chilean fruit in us ports 
a government source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
the caller indicated in his threat that his motive was to focus 
attention on the lower classes of chile 
the fda learned of the threat late in the afternoon on march 3 
mclearn said the following day a saturday young called together a 
group from his regulatory affairs staff emergency office and the 
center for food safety and applied nutrition said mclearn who 
attended the meeting that lasted into the evening 
young agreed to continue the detention the customs service had 
begun throughout the weekend while he talked to officials at the 
state department customs service the chilean ambassador and fruit 
importers to try to figure out the magnitude of this and grapple 
with the decision of what to do the spokesman said 
but by the end of the weekend the state department had concluded 
the threat was a hoax he said 
we felt at that point there was no reason for a full detention 
but that we would do surveillance mclearn said at that point 
we were prepared to let the fruit through and issued a release 
about the hoax 
a story about the call to the embassy and the determination that 
it was a hoax appeared in a santiago newspaper and on march 8 the 
caller we assume it was the same guy the fda spokesman said 
phoned the embassy again and said the threat was not a hoax 
the fda heightened its inspections at each of the us ports 
where chilean fruit enters the united states mclearn said 
most of the fruit enters through the port at philadelphia and 
there the almeria star had just arrived with the next major import 
from chile he said it was on that ship that inspectors making a 
visual inspection last sunday found two grapes that were discolored 
and had crystalline rings around puncture marks 
the grapes were sent to an fda laboratory in philadelphia which 
made an initial finding that the grapes contained cyanide they were 
then sent to another fda lab in cincinnati which confirmed traces 
of the poison in the grapes mclearn said 
the spokesman said did not know when the tests were completed he 
said young made the decision sunday night that he had to make a 
decision and he made the decision monday though he could not give 
a time 
he soul searched and soul searched mclearn said of young 
during the night sunday and on monday young talked to members of 
his policy board including the agencys attorney trying to 
determine a legal and most appropriate action to take the spokesman 
said 
even though you make a decision that youre going to do 
something you still have to decide the magnitude of how far you 
go do you just detain grapes or other fruit also mclearn said 
he also indicated that young had considered detaining other chilean 
produce as well but declined to discuss such details of youngs 
decisionmaking 
young also considered how much force to put behind his action 
mclearn said though the fda lacked the legal authority t order 
stores to withdraw the chilean imports off the shelves you can 
exert pressure he said 
after the decision was made monday young spent time making 
sure all the proper bases were touched the public health service 
the department of health and human services the white house 
they all had to know mclearn said

much of the controversy about the satanic verses relates to 
the contention by moslem groups that the author is questioning the 
validity of muhammads revelations in one key passage a scribe 
whose name like the authors is salman confides to a pagan poet 
baal some details of a dream that has ruined salmans faith to 
understand the meaning of the dream the reader needs to identify 
other names the scribe refers to mahound is the prophet muhammad 
gibreel is the archangel gabriel and shaitan is satan 
the following is an excerpt from the passage that appears on 
pages 367 and 368 of the satanic verses 
one night the persian scribe had a dream in which he was 
hovering above the figure of mahound at the prophets cave on mount 
cone at first salman took this to be no more than a nostalgic 
reverie of the old days in jahilia but then it struck him that his 
point of view in the dream had been that of the archangel and at 
that moment the memory of the incident of the satanic verses came 
back to him as vividly as if the thing had happened the previous 
day maybe i hadnt dreamed of myself as gibreel salman 
recounted maybe i was shaitan the realization of this 
possibility gave him his diabolic idea after that when he sat at 
the prophets feet writing down rules rules rules he began 
surreptitiously to change things 
little things at first if mahound recited a verse in which 
god was described as allhearing allknowing i would write 
allknowing allwise heres the point mahound did not notice the 
alterations so there i was actually writing the book or 
rewriting anyway polluting the word of god with my own profane 
language but good heavens if my poor words could not be 
distinguished from the revelation by gods own messenger then what 
did that mean what did that say about the divine quality of the 
divine poetry look i swear i was shaken to my soul its one 
thing to be a smart bastard and have halfsuspicions about funny 
business but its quite another thing to find out that youre 
right listen i changed my life for that man i left my country 
crossed the world settled among people who thought me a slimy 
foreign coward for saving their who never appreciated what i but 
never mind that the truth is that what i expected when i made that 
first tiny change allwise instead of allhearing what i wanted 
was to read it back to the prophet and hes say whats the matter 
with you salman are you going deaf and id say oops o god bit 
of a slip how could i and correct myself but it didnt happen 
and now i was writing the revelation and nobody was noticing and i 
didnt have the courage to own up i was scared silly i cam tell 
you also i was sadder than i have ever been so i had to go on 
doing it maybe hes just missed out once i thought anybody can 
make a mistake so the next time i changed a bigger thing he said 
christian i wrote down jew hed notice that surely how could he 
not but when i read him the chapter he nodded and thanked me 
politely and i went out of his tent with tears in my eyes

in earlier passages salman again talking to baal about the 
dream tells how he came to the conclusions that made him question 
his faith here are two excerpts from pages 363 and 364 
the faithful lived by lawlessness but in those years mahound 
or should one say the archangel gibreel should one say alleh 
became obsessed by law amid the palmtrees of the oasis gibreel 
appeared to the prophet and found himself spouting rules rules 
rules until the faithful could scarcely bear the prospect of any 
more revelation salman said rules about every damn thing if a man 
farts let him turn his face to the wind a rule about which hand to 
use for the purpose of cleaning ones behind it was as if no aspect 
of human existence was to be left unregulated free the revelation 
the recitation told the faithful how much to eat how deeply 
they should sleep and which sexual positions had received divine 
sanction so that they learned that sodomy and the missionary 
position were approved of by the archangel whereas the forbidden 
postures included all those in which the female was on top gibreel 
further listed the permitted and forbidden subjects of conversation 
and earmarked the parts of the body which could not be scratched no 
matter how unbearably they might itch he vetoed the consumption of 
prawns those bizarre otherworldly creatures which no member of the 
faithful had ever seen 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
and the other passage 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
and gibreel the archangel specified the manner in which a man 
should be buried and how his property should be divided so that 
salman the persian got to wondering what manner of god this was that 
sounded so much like a businessman this was when he had the idea 
that destroyed his faith because he recalled that of course mahound 
himself had been a businessman and a damned successful one at that 
a person to whom organization and rules came naturally so how 
excessively convenient it was that he should have come up with such 
a very businesslike archangel who handed down the management 
decisions of this highly corporate if noncorporeal god

the new spiritual leader of millions of 
soviet moslems said wednesday that followers of islam should show 
restraint about the satanic verses the allegedly blasphemous 
novel by salman rushdie 
the 36yearold mufti said rushdie should be judged in a forum 
where he can defend himself 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini pronounced a death sentence on the 
indianborn british author feb 14 and iranian clerics offered a 
52 million reward rushdie has been in hiding since 
mahammadsadyk mamayusupov said in an interview the day after 
being chosen to lead the moslems of central asia first in my 
opinion it is necessary to pass judgment and after a judgment is 
made to announce a reprimand this is not so simple in rushdies 
absence 
he said moslems of the soviet union are also displeased that 
rushdie published a novel in which islam was insulted but added 
i dont know who rushdie is i dont know in what circumstances he 
was writing therefore i cant judge him 
if rushdie is a moslem he should be judged by other moslems 
mamayusupov said but if the novelist is not a moslem a different 
forum must be found he did not say what other kind of forum would 
be appropriate 
rushdie 41 was born to moslem parents in bombay india but has 
said he no longer practices religion 
among elements of his novel moslems find objectionable are a 
scene in which prostitutes take the names of mohammeds wives and 
the suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy koran rather than 
receiving it fromn allah 
about 50 million moslems live in the soviet union the vast 
majority in the central asian republics near iran afghanistan and 
china 
mamayusupov is rector of the higher islamic institute in 
tashkent both supporters and opponents consider him a strong and 
energetic leader but those who reject government control of 
religion fear he will cooperate too closely with authorities 
he replaced shamsuddinkhan babakhan who was forced to resign in 
february because of charges that he was corrupt and lacked religious 
knowledge babakhan was the third in a hereditary line of muftis 
established in the 1940s 
soon after mamayusupov was chosen tuesday several thousand 
moslems shouting god is great carried the 7th century koran of 
caliph osman to the islamic institute the holy book was being 
returned to religious authorities by the officially atheist soviet 
government which had kept it in a museum 
mamayusupov dressed in a white turban and simple grey coat said 
wednesday the events reflected increased religious feeling among 
soviet moslems he gave credit to president mikhail s gorbachevs 
more liberal policies 
the change in soviet society has reached moslems as well he 
said they have started to feel freer they can express their 
emotions and actively take part in the social life of the country 
religion is tightly controlled in the soviet union and 
dissidents of all faiths criticize officially sanctioned religious 
authorities for submitting to state domination 
some moslems privately favor an iranianstyle islamic republic in 
soviet central asia they say irans experience and the success of 
moslem insurgents against soviet soldiers in afghanistan have made 
some soviet moslems more radical 
that is a serious worry for soviet authorities who already have 
ethnic troubles in the caucasus region and the baltic republics the 
population of central asia is growing rapidly and a campaign for 
greater autonomy or outright independence based in religion could be 
difficult to control 
the new mufti rejected the possibility of a strong radical 
movement reaching soviet moslems from iran or afghanistan 
we have our own history he said we have deep roots in 
islam we have our own view and our own foundation we can influence 
others but others cannot influence us 
he is pressing the government for construction of new mosques and 
publication of more religious literature 
we will continue to open mosques until all the requests of our 
moslems are satisfied he said there is an agreement on that 
between us and the government 
religious and civil authorities have agreed to open almost 40 new 
mosques in the five central asian republics which now have about 
200 mamayusupov said

president reagan in 1985 not only approved a 
secret pact to give honduras more than 110 million for helping the 
nicaraguan contras but he also telephoned honduras president when 
the honduran military delayed an ammunition shipment to the rebels 
the oliver north jury was told wednesday 
reagan made a note of his call to roberto suazo that said the 
honduran will call his military commander to tell him to deliver 
the ammunition former national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
testified at the oliver north trial the ammunition then got to the 
guerrillas 
under questioning by defense lawyers mcfarlane detailed how 
reagan initialed a plan in midfebruary 1985 that resulted in 
honduras getting speededup deliveries of rifles ammunition and 
machines 
it was a quid pro quo arrangement that reagan was advised 
would provide incentives to the hondurans for helping out 
youre going to give them tens of millions of dollars to 
cooperate north lawyer brendan sullivan asked mcfarlane 
yes the witness said 
there is nothing dirty about quid pro quo is there 
no 
later reading from a previously secret memo sullivan referred 
to 75 million in economic assistance he also referred to 35 
million in expedited militarty aid 
the matter was so sensitive mcfarlane acknowledged under 
questioning that the arrangement was discussed verbally by the us 
ambassador in honduras with suazo and was not given to him in 
writing 
norths lawyers say the reagan administration had a policy of 
hiding such arrangements with other countries to support the contras 
during a twoyear period in which the socalled the boland amendment 
prohibited us military aid to the guerrillas 
wednesday was mcfarlanes fourth day on the witness stand and he 
was admonished frequently by the judge to rely on his own memory 
rather than parroting documents that were shown to him to 
refresh his often vague recollection his lawyer said afterward 
that the witness had not seen some of those papers since they were 
created in 1984 and 1985 
mcfarlane who was norths boss at the national security council 
until december 1985 will return thursday for more crossexamination 
sullivan brought out that on may 29 1987 testifying on capitol 
hill long after details of the american dealings with honduras had 
become public mcfarlane clung to his story that no one in the us 
government had contacted central american leaders to aid the contras 
obviously we have embassies in all these countries he said 
then i dont know of any direction from washington to those 
embassies to seek out aid to the contras 
asked wednesday whether he regarded the arrangement with honduras 
acceptable in light of the boland restrictions mcfarlane replied 
that the president took that action 
sullivan the amendment states that people involved in the 
intelligence communities cannot assist the contras 
mcfarlane it didnt seem to me that he was in any way a member 
of the intelligence community 
five of the criminal charges against north the former national 
security council aide are that he made false statements and 
obstructed congress in 1985 and 1986 with regard to his activities 
on behalf of the contras 
mcfarlane had told the national security council staff including 
north that the congressional amendment applied to the nsc 
the president of the united states had a much more different 
view of the boland amendment than you do sullivan asked 
when mcfarlane answered yes sullivan pressed a much more 
liberal view 
we were pretty close 
in a recent questionandanswer session with north prosecutors 
the former president maintained as he had all along that he relied 
on a 1985 legal opinion that concluded that the boland amendment 
did not apply to the actions of the nsc staff 
north has insisted he always acted with superiors authority and 
the questioning was an effort to show the wide knowledge among top 
officials of his efforts in behalf of the contras 
reagan initialed his approval of the honduran plan on feb 18 
1985 on april 25 according to the testimony mcfarlane recommended 
that reagan phone suazo because the honduran military this morning 
stopped a shipment of ammunition and that it must continue if 
the resistance is to survive 
that day reagan wrote on the bottom of the memo that suazo 
expressed his respect for me he believes we must continue to 
oppose communism he will call his military commander and tell him 
to deliver the ammunition 
at the time of the quid pro quo arrangements honduras was 
harboring many of the contras in camps along the countrys southern 
border and honduran officials feared sandinista troops might come 
across the border from nicaragua 
there was a temporary halt in the trial as norths lawyers tried 
to introduce classified material while crossexamining mcfarlane 
gesell said he will rule on a piecemeal basis in connection with 
the information norths attorneys want to present in crossexamining 
mcfarlane rather in advance as requested by chief trial prosecutor 
john keker 
he also permitted norths lawyers to introduce the names of 
central american countries and central american officials in 
documents that spell out quid pro quo arrangements with honduras and 
other countries

experts said wednesday the bush 
administrations ban on imports of semiautomatic rifles would have 
scant impact on crime since so many of those weapons already are in 
circulation and more are being manufactured domestically 
the lifting of the import permits will reduce the supply of 
assault weapons to gun dealers in the country said cheryl epps 
legislative anaylst for the international association of chiefs of 
police but many assault weapons are manufactured domestically 
the suspension wont have any effect on crime because the flow 
of weapons will remain the same if domestic manufacturers fill the 
void she said 
however the growth of the domestic arsenal promised to take a 
decline too with an announcement by colt industries inc on 
wednesday that it was voluntarily suspending sales of its 
domestically produced ar15 semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles 
colt would not say how many of the weapons it makes 
if it is determined by the government review that semiautomatic 
rifles are not appropriate for the commercial market we will not 
sell the ar15 in that market said colt spokesman mike dunn 
bush administration drug director william j bennett welcomed 
colts decision as an act of civic responsibility 
on tuesday bennett announced the suspension of pending import 
permits for more than 110000 semiautomatic rifles referred to as 
assaultstyle because they look like machine guns 
the white house stressed wednesday that there were no plans to 
curtail sales of similar rifles produced domestically 
gwynne peirson retired professor of criminology at howard 
university and a police officer for 23 years in oakland calif 
said the ban on imports will have no immediate impact but 
ultimately could if it is made permanent 
i think the ban on imports will have a definite positive 
effect but it will have to trickle down and we may not even see the 
impact next year he said 
so many of them have been brought in in the recent past that 
they will still be in the market he said the only thing the 
ban will do in the short run is to increase the price of the 
available weapons 
gregg risch of handgun control one of the countrys leading gun 
control advocates said the organization is thrilled by the 
administrations action but was even harsher than peirson in his 
assessment of the possible impact on crime saying simply zero 
there are a couple of million of them already out on the 
streets gun stores already have large stocks of ones already 
imported and domestically made ones and yesterdays action doesnt 
do anything to stop them from selling those risch said 
were not saying it will have a tremendous effect on crime 
said one treasury department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity but in three to four years we would have 1 million of 
those guns here 
the colt ar15 the semiautomatic version of the militarys m16 
rifle is the most similar domestically made weapon to those whose 
imports have been suspended such as semiautomatic versions of 
ak47s and uzi carbines according to dick pedersen of the treasury 
departments bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
the suspension on imports does not affect thousands of other 
semiautomatic rifles awaiting import permits pedersen said 
hunting rifles that are semiautomatic do not look like 
automatic weapons he said the ones that dont look like 
automatic weapons are still coming in 
according to estimates by the national rifle association and gun 
control activists there are 60 million to 70 million firearms in 
private hands in the united states including 20 million to 30 
million semiautomatic weapons ranging from pistols to the 
assaultstyle rifles 
but it is unclear exactly how many semiautomatic rifles 
including assaultstyle weapons are produced in the united states 
pedersen said 
in 1987 the united states produced a total of 176 million 
handguns and 101 million rifles including regular bolt and pump 
action armaments as well as semiautomatics pedersen said that was 
a 300000 jump in both categories handguns and rifles from the 
previous year and the number was expected to have increased in 1988 
the nra which opposes limits on weapons other than machineguns 
that already are banned maintains that only cosmetic differences 
exist between those whose imports have been suspended and the rest 
including weapons that have been around for a century

a joint heater on one of morton thiokols two 
booster rockets failed hours before the monday launch of the space 
shuttle discovery but a backup heater worked a nasa official said 
wednesday 
royce mitchell manager of thiokols shuttle motor program for 
the national aeronautics and space administration said he learned 
of cooling indicating heater failure in the aft field joint of the 
right booster about midnight before the launch 
it had all the appearances of a highcurrent short mitchell 
said in a telephone interview from huntsville ala the cause of the 
electrical surge was unknown wednesday 
the short apparently either damaged the heater itself or wiring 
mitchell said a backup heater was turned on 
overall he said officials were pleased with the performance of 
the boosters 
flight data and a look at the motors which were retrieved 
tuesday from the atlantic ocean showed they performed well and did 
not have any cork insulation loss like that suspected of damaging 
orbiters on the previous two shuttle flights 
they were certainly right down the line mitchell said 
the boosters burned just 14 seconds longer than predicted during 
the two minutes the boosters are used 
were very pleased with that kind of performance mitchell 
said 
we did not compromise any safety figures mitchell said of 
the decision to proceed with launch we had played this what if 
game before in tests of such an occurrence 
on dec 8 a heater shorted on a booster being prepared for test 
firing at thiokols wasatch operations plant west of brigham city 
the heaters part of a redesign of the motors prompted by 
destruction of the shuttle challenger in 1986 maintain resiliency 
of oring seals in the three field joints of each motor each heater 
has a backup 
external inspection of the motors after their return to land 
tuesday showed no evidence of hot exhaust gases escaping the seals

president mikhail s gorbachev said wednesday that 
all soviet farmers should be permitted to lease their land and 
decide what to plant in a new national program to ease chronic food 
shortages but he said it will be years before the country can feed 
itself 
gorbachev called food shortages our societys biggest wound 
meat sugar and many other foodstuffs must be rationed in numerous 
soviet regions 
in a tacit acknowledgement that one of his earlier attempts to 
rejuvenate soviet agriculture had failed gorbachev proposed 
abolishing a government superagency created in 1985 to oversee the 
countrys farm sector 
the communist partys policymaking central committee convened 
by party general secretary gorbachev began a twoday meeting 
wednesday largely devoted to agricultural reform it will look for 
ways to increase the food supply and improve traditionally dreary 
rural life 
gorbachev asked the committee to approve an agrarian policy 
that will be able to restore the peasant as the master on the land 
and dependably solve the food problem 
further delay in this matter is simply inadmissible he said 
the 58yearold kremlin leader the former party overseer for 
agriculture and the son of a southern russian peasant said 
conditions in some rural regions were at a critical level with 
mass migration of their populations to cities 
he said farm productivity is so low the soviet union must go 
abroad to buy large quantities of grain meat fruits vegetables 
sugar vegetable oil and some other staples to meet demand at home 
losses of grain due to inefficiency total 40 million metric tons 
equal to soviet grain purchases abroad gorbachev said he 
endorsed focusing on making soviet farming and food processing work 
better rather than on increasing the area under cultivation 
in 1988 gross soviet farm output rose only 07 percent and the 
grain harvest was only 195 million metric tons 16 million below the 
annual average achieved in 198687 according to washington 
dcbased planecon inc which studies soviet economic performance 
gorbachev said the ruling politburo would ask the 300member 
central committee for extensive transition to leasing or 
allowing work collectives and individuals to work stateowned 
farmland in exchange for a fee 
western analysts say leasing benefits would be largely annulled 
if moscowbased bureaucrats retain the right to dictate which crops 
should be planted on individual plots and in which quantities but 
gorbachev said leaseholders should be given a virtual free hand 
let us not fix assignments let us not set deadlines 
gorbachev said gorbachev who first proposed leasing last june 
said all units of the farm should work on the lease principle 
he has said leasing guarantees higher production because 
leaseholders can earn more if they work harder rather than getting 
a fixed salary regardless of output as has been traditional on 
soviet state and collective farms 
gorbachev said more flexible prices for crops purchased by 
the state would go into effect next jan 1 and the number of 
products for which prices are fixed by bureaucrats would be reduced 
he reassured soviet consumers prices will stay the same for the 
next two or three years for bread flour cereals meat fish 
eggs milk sugar butter vegetable oils and baby foods despite 
the admitted pressing need for price reform to curtail state 
subsidies 
one proposal calls for abolishment of the state agroindustrial 
committee created in november 1985 eight months after gorbachev 
was named soviet leader 
he said the giant agency would be replaced by a commission of the 
council of ministers or soviet cabinet 
while calling for urgent measures to improve the soviet diet 
gorbachev said a definite end to food shortages could not be 
expected until the middle of next decade 
gorbachevs onehour 45minute speech on agriculture was later 
shown on staterun television 
the central committee earlier moved to formally elect its top 
leaders and other representatives including gorbachev to the 
nations new parliament 
the communist party is one of 30 organizations with the power to 
choose onethird of the 2250 representatives in the new congress of 
peoples deputies 
despite publicity touting this campaign as the soviet unions 
first election with competing candidates the party chose to 
nominate just 100 persons for its 100 seats party members had 
suggested more than 31000 names 
the food problem is likely to produce far more discussion at the 
central committee plenum since the partys conservative agriculture 
chief yegor k ligachev apparently disagrees with gorbachev on a 
solution 
ligachev has said little about gorbachevs call for leasing 
instead emphasizing collective farming the system that has left 
soviets standing in line for meat and vegetables 
gorbachev said wednesday increased investment to modernize 
collective farms was not enough that huge capital investments in 
agriculture in recent years failed to yield equally substantial

president daniel ortega said wednesday 
his leftist government will allow a roman catholic church radio news 
program to resume and will let 10 expelled priests return to 
nicaragua 
we are trying to create a better climate in our country that 
strengthens the tendency towards total and definitive peace that the 
nicaraguan people demand ortega said after meeting with cardinal 
miguel obando y bravo head of the nicaraguan church 
in neighboring honduras president jose azcona hoyo said his 
government was working on a plan to demobilize thousands of 
nicaraguan rebels in camps near the border and he denied reports 
that the united states has asked the government to let them stay 
another year 
honduras is interested in demobilizing the contras because 
their departure from our territory is in the benefit of national 
security he told reporters 
azcona hoyo and the four other central american presidents agreed 
last month to repatriate the rebels or move them to third countries 
nicaragua said it would move up elections scheduled for november 
1990 and take other steps toward greater democracy 
ortega said wednesday that radio catolicas iglesia news 
program shut down by the sandinista government july 11 would be 
allowed to resume immediately 
in addition to the shutdown the leftist government in july 
expelled us ambassador richard melton and seven other us 
diplomats from nicaragua arrested at least 40 people at a major 
opposition demonstration and closed the opposition newspaper la 
prensa for 15 days 
ortega announced the government would allow 10 priests to return 
to nicaragua and would review a list of other priests barred from 
the country to determine whether they could return 
the sandinistas expelled the 10 priests between 1982 and 1985 for 
allegedly plotting against the government 
those priests eligible to return to nicaragua are francisco 
castelli vicente caudeli francisco san martin santiago de anitua 
and luis corrales of spain vicente huerta jose montero and jose 
maria pacheco of costa rica mario fiandri of italy and mario 
madriz of panama 
monsignor bismarck carballo director of radio catolica told the 
associated press wednesday the government might grant entry to five 
more priests it had expelled carballo did not identify the priests 
obando y bravo told ortega that a government amnesty should be 
extended to all jailed members of the former national guard and 
political prisoners ortega said 
the national assembly on tuesday approved amnesty for 1894 
former guardsmen most of whom had been jailed since the 1979 
revolution that brought the sandinistas to power 
the assembly refused to grant an amnesty for 39 former guardsmen 
who it said had committed atrocious crimes against the 
nicaraguan people 
the new york times reported tuesday that robert m kimmit us 
undersecretary of state for political affairs formally asked 
honduras on monday to let the contras stay for another year 
but azcona said wednesday we only talked about humanitarian 
aid for the contras 
ortega said wednesday that more us humanitarian aid for the 
rebels would violate the central american peace plan only aid 
designed to dismantle the guerrilla army is acceptable under the 
regional accords he said 
government sources in washington and rebel leaders have said the 
bush administration plans to ask for a 12month humanitarian aid 
package for the rebels that totals between 40 million and 50 
million 
this runs against the accords we central american presidents 
signed in el salvador and we cannot let it pass peacefully 
ortega said of the reported aid request he spoke with reporters 
after a meeting with roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo 
ortega and the presidents of honduras el salvador guatemala and 
costa rica agreed at the feb 1314 summit to draft a plan to 
demobilize the contras about 11000 of whom are in base camps in 
honduras 
in turn ortega pledged to institute democratic reforms in 
nicaragua and move up general elections by 10 months to february 
1990 
a 27 million package of rebel humanitarian assistance approved 
by congress last year runs out at the end of march 
the united states has supported the contras since 1981 in their 
war to oust the leftist sandinista government the contras fled to 
honduras after us military assistance expired in february 1988 
the sandinistas and contras signed a provisional ceasefire pact 
in march 1988 that has been unilaterally extended on a monthly basis 
by the government the contras have tacitly accepted the extensions 
but talks on a permanent ceasefire have stalled

here are excerpts of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs speech wednesday to a communist party central committee 
meeting whose purpose he described as developing an agrarian 
policy that will be able to restore the peasant as the master on the 
land and dependably resolve the food problem 
they were taken from the englishlanguage translation by the 
official news agency tass 
on the overall problem 
further delay in this matter is simply inadmissible 
drastic changes in the countryside are an essential prerequisite 
for the countrys economic and social progress we all remember 
the concern expressed by delegates to the 19th national party 
conference when discussing the food supply situation in the country 
we described this problem as our societys biggest wound 
the state has to buy large quantities of grain meat fruit 
vegetables sugar vegetable oil and some other staples abroad we 
are still behind developed countries big and small in labor 
efficiency yield capacity and livestock productivity and in the 
diversity and quality of foodstuffs the gap is widening rather than 
narrowing the shortage of food creates social tension and generates 
not merely criticism but actual discontent 
huge capital and other investments have been made in agriculture 
in recent years but the inputs have failed to yield equally 
substantial results 
comrades we should work out an agrarian policy that would enable 
us to blunt the sharp edge of the food problem in the immediate 
future and to grow enough farm produce in terms of both amount and 
choice to stabilize food supplies in the 13th fiveyear plan 
199196 
in the 13th fiveyear period it is planned to increase the 
output of foodstuffs by 26 percent to 30 percent while the output 
of farm produce will grow by 16 percent 
on stalins brutal collectivization of agriculture 
in the process of combatting the kulaks violence was inflicted 
upon the huge mass of middlestrata peasants and even poor ones 
millions of peasants together with their families were torn away 
from their land plots and native areas and suffered misfortunes 
often dying in camps and exile 
on leasing 
let us not fix assignments let us not set deadlines the point 
at issue is the transfer of land and other means of production to 
leaseholders their real control over those means 
if the plenum backs the relevant proposals of the politburo the 
presidium of the ussr supreme soviet and the government and we 
adopt corresponding documents this will create legal and economic 
prerequisites for an extensive transition to leasing 
on price reform 
the purposes of economic restructuring cannot be achieved new 
methods of economic management cannot be introduced and a socialist 
market cannot be formed without a price reform purchase prices 
of some kinds of quality products are so low as not to stimulate the 
development and rational distribution of specialized highly 
marketable production 
the documents circulated among you envisage the introduction of 
new purchase prices of farm produce as of jan 1 1990 the 
range of products priced in a centralized way should be reduced 
on banks 
there is a need for radical restructuring of the activity of 
banks particularly of the agroindustrial bank it is necessary to 
ensure that they are really interested in the development of 
production and act as business partners 
on the independence of agricultural enterprises 
agricultural enterprises are really doubly dependent on the one 
hand they are subordinated to higher bodies along the departmental 
line they are also managed in no less perhaps even in a greater 
degree by local party and government bodies starting from the 
district level 
perestroika presupposes a radical change in the system of 
managing the agrarian sector at all levels we proceeded from 
the assumption that no one should interfere in the daytoday 
economic activities of collective and state farms and still less 
with peasant and individual small holdings 
on equipment problems in agriculture 
workers of the agrarian sector rightly complain that the 
machinemakers abusing their monopoly status often foist upon them 
outdated models of expensive machines with low dependability and 
efficiency standards this is ruinous not only for agriculture but 
for the country as a whole 
we produce more tractors than any other country in the world and 
yet complaints about their short supply are common 
machinemakers should be put in such economic conditions that would 
rule out the manufacture of shoddy equipment 
on waste in agriculture 
our losses in grain harvesting and prestorage treatment amount 
to 15 million and even 20 million tons about as much is lost in 
storage and processing in all comrades the losses equal our 
purchases abroad 
due to the sparsity of meat packing plants their low 
technological standards and inefficient use of raw material meat 
losses even according to the lowest estimates add up to around 1 
million tons this despite the acute shortage of foodstuffs such is 
the dimension of the problem 
many problems stem from the methods of economic management 
peoples attitude to work and their poor motivation to achieve 
better end results 
on ecology 
what must be done as a matter of urgency is putting reclaimed 
lands in proper order and taking measures to put land and water to 
more rational use efforts to come to grips with ecological problems 
that have piled up should not be put off either 
we should drastically raise standards and increase accountablity 
when it comes to the production transportation and storage of 
chemicals and especially their application to the soil 
on life in the villages 
the peasant mode of life has lost its attractiveness and 
prestige people above all the young are leaving villages 
the disregard for the needs of villages and the hypertrophied 
urban development brought about great social distortions and 
complicated the normal economic functioning of whole regions 
the rates of house building in villages in the 13th fiveyear 
period must at least be doubled 
villagers justly raise the issue why rural areas have been put on 
short rations and why peasants have been left to struggle with 
their problems alone although the country has vast resources

of san franciscos earthquake of 1906 bechtel created one of the 
worlds largest engineering and construction firms the privately 
held bechtel group inc 
the company built hoover dam pipelines mines whole seaports 
and harbors scores of hotels towering buildings and transportation

a great idea bechtel sketched out the plan on the tablecloth 
a few years later 80000 barrels of oil flowed through the 
718mile canadian transmountain pipeline it was called one of the 
most remarkable pipeline engineering feats in history 
bechtel managed construction of the fourcounty bay area rapid 
transit system and the san franciscooakland bay bridge which 
bechtel commuted over from his oakland home every working day 
despite the crush of bridge traffic which sets most motorists 
griping bechtel thought it was quite a nice thing to do every day 
on the way to his 32ndfloor office in the companys san francisco 
headquarters 
its a very pleasant ride and traffic isnt that bad he told 
a reporter in a rare interview 
bechtel was one of the university of california at berkeleys 
most successful dropouts in a hurry to get on with his vision he 
quit college in 1920 but the university named him alumnus of the 
year in 1952 
berkeley chancellor ira michael heyman hailed bechtels loyalty 
and generosity to the university particularly in establishing a 
63 million engineering center

a convicted copkiller awarded clemency by 
gov mario cuomo in 1985 won parole wednesday in a case that has 
fed the controversy over efforts to restore the death penalty in the 
state 
gary mcgivern 44 could leave the mediumsecurity prison here by 
the end of the week parole board officials said he was convicted 
13 years ago in the 1968 shooting death of william fitzgerald 
michael kavanagh who prosecuted mcgivern and codefendant 
charles culhane said the parole boards decision was a real 
tragedy and a sad commentary on our criminal justive system 
mcgivern had twice previously been denied parole 
some law enforcement officials who critisized mcgiverns parole 
said it might nudge state legislators who are considering whether to 
override a cuomo veto of legislation to restore new yorks death 
penalty 
thats just wishful thinking cuomo said at a news 
conference advocates of the death penalty will tell you that a 
leaf that fell from the tree was a sign 
the states electric chair hasnt been used since 1963 cuomo has 
successfully vetoed death penalty legislation for the past six years 
while mcgivern was viewed by many as an unrepentant copkiller 
he had some wellknown and vocal supporters including folk singer 
pete seeger conservative columnist william f buckley and civil 
rights lawyer william kunstler 
its been a long haul ive been in this for 13 years said 
kuntsler im happy for gary his wife and his family 
through three trials mcgivern and culhane have steadfastly 
maintained their innocence in the death of fitzgerald a westchester 
county deputy 
fitzgerald was shot during an escape attempt by mcgivern culhane 
and a third inmate robert bowerman who were being driven to a 
court date by fitzgerald and another officer 
at the time mcgivern and culhane were serving sentences for 
robbing a gas station together they claimed bowerman acted alone 
kavanagh said mcgivern fired the shot that killed fitzerald 
mcgivern wasnt granting interviews wednesday but culhane said 
thats wonderful when told the news 
its about time hell do good out there said culhane an 
awardwinning prison poet and dramatist 
culhane was not eligible for a parole hearing until late 1991 
the parole board said it was releasing mcgivern for good conduct 
it was felt that mr mcgivern could live and remain at liberty 
without violating the law said an statement read by edward elwin 
the boards executive director 
mcgivern plans to live with marguerite culp a former newspaper 
reporter who met mcgivern in prison and married him in a prisonyard 
ceremony a decade ago elwin said 
mcgivern and culhanes first trial ended in a hung jury their 
second ended with death sentences but those convictions were 
overturned the two were convicted after a third trial in 1975 
it was a very difficult call cuomo said of his clemency 
ruling this man is not a cop killer 
cuomos action drew criticism from thenvice president george 
bush

supreme court justice sandra day oconnor said 
wednesday she regrets a letter she wrote that has been used by 
conservative republicans in her home state of arizona to support 
their claim that the united states is a christian nation 
i regret that a letter i sent to an acquaintance in response to 
her request for information was used in a political debate 
oconnor said in a brief statement it was not my intention to 
express a personal view about the subject of the inquiry but merely 
to attempt to respond appropriately to one of the many requests for 
information which come across my desk 
oconnor declined further comment 
the letter prompted some harsh criticism of oconnor by legal 
scholars and people for the american way a group that promotes 
separation of church and state 
arthur j kropp president of people for the american way wrote 
to the justice 
like many americans i was surprised to read about your letter 
suggesting that three supreme court decisions have held that the 
united states is a christian nation 
the christian nation movement has emerged in recent years as a 
force for religious intolerance its effect is to make 
nonchristians feel excluded from society and to define christians 
on the basis of narrow political views 
bruce fein a conservative lawyer who closely follows supreme 
court developments said the letter creates an ugly image in 
having such a sensitive issue treated in such a cavalier way 
he said the letter is grossly improper because oconnor 
gratuitously intruded herself into the political process 
issues of religious freedom are perhaps the most inflammatory 
that have ever reached the supreme court fein said judges must 
have not only actual impartiality but the appearance of it 
laurence tribe a liberal law school professor at harvard 
university said in an interview with the washington post it is 
astonishing for any justice in the late 20th century to treat the 
courts references to the religious character of our country as 
somehow equivalent to the proclamation that this is a christian 
nation 
oconnors letter dated may 19 1988 was sent to annetta 
conant author of a resolution characterizing the united states as a 
christian nation that was adopted in january by the arizona 
republican party 
the resolution is a rallying point for backers of former arizona 
gov evan mecham a republican who was removed from office last 
year moderate republicans and prominent jewish republicans in the 
state have expressed dismay over the resolution which also said the 
nation is a republic based upon the absolute laws of the bible 
not a democracy based on the changing whims of people 
oconnor a former state legislator in arizona who has been on 
the high court since 1981 said in her letter to ms conant you 
wrote me recently to inquire about any holdings of this court to the 
effect that this a christian nation there are statements to such 
effect in the following opinions 
the letter then cites three high court rulings in one handed 
down in 1892 the court said we are a christian people and the 
morality of the country is deeply engrafted upon christianity 
but two more recent opinions do not refer to the united states as 
a christian nation in the pages cited by oconnor 
one opinion written by the liberal william o douglas when he 
was a member of the court in 1952 said we are a religious people 
whose institutions presuppose a supreme being we guarantee the 
freedom to worship as one chooses 
the other a concurring opinion written in 1961 by thenjustice 
felix frankfurter said religious beliefs in america shall 
continue to exist to function free of the dictates and 
directions of the state frankfurter was jewish 
oconnors statement wednesday did not say whether she actually 
did the research or wrote the letter to ms conant 
but the supreme courts public information office said oconnors 
letter was similar to one written in 1975 by the courts librarian 
in response to a request for information by an oregon woman

the czech writers union ended a 
twoday meeting on wednesday that was marked by controversy and 
staterun media called for differentiated treatment of banned 
and emigre authors 
the meeting was the latest in a series of discussions between 
intellectuals and communist party and government figures following 
signs of increasing discontent among the nations artists 
thousands of actors musicians writers and cultural workers 
recently signed a petition asking authorities for a meaningful 
dialogue more truthful media coverage of urgent political issues 
and the release of playwrightactivist vaclav havel and other 
political prisoners 
havel whose plays were banned in czechoslovakia after the 1968 
sovietled invasion crushed prague spring reforms was jailed in 
february for nine months on charges of incitement and obstructing a 
police officer 
the state news agency ctk said speakers at the writers meeting 
tackled again from different and sometimes controversial 
standpoints the contemporary situation in czech literature 
and also the general context of the political climate 
it said that culture minister milan kymlicka and the recently 
elected head of the federal czechoslovak writers union miroslav 
valek attended the meeting of the czech writers union the two 
organizations are separate 
valek a slovak poet was made head of the czechoslovak writers 
union after resigning late last year as slovak minister of culture 
following an article he wrote urging more reform 
czechoslovakias leaders installed after the 1968 invasion have 
found it difficult to follow kremlin reforms moscow at one time 
asked the leaders to quash many of the same reforms 
one problem is how to deal now with the hundreds of intellectuals 
barred from official cultural life and the 500000 people expelled 
from the party after 1968 
we must not be silent about some controversial names from our 
literature especially from the end of the 60s we mustnt walk 
around the works of these authors as if they didnt exist michal 
cernik head of the czech writers union was quoted as saying by the 
rude pravo daily on wednesday 
offical historians consider the czechoslovak writers union as 
having spearheaded the shortlived period of reform in 1968 
some of the foremost members of the union such as writer milan 
kundera left the country after the 1968 invasion others continued 
writing in underground publications 
the meeting also dealt with the activities of emigre writers 
and recommends evaluating their work and differentiating rude

restoring the capital gains differential will lift revenues 
help savings and free american businesses without distorting world 
markets he said 
the united states should keep in mind that some pacific rim trade 
competitors including hong kong singapore and korea exempt 
capital gains from taxes while japan scarcely taxed them during 
her meteoric rise he said 
on the other hand he said competitors that tax capital gains 
punitively by punishing risk takers they stifle opportunity les 
opportunity means less capital to invest less capital in turn 
makes countries less competitive 
bush also urged alternative certification of school teachers 
so that people without the usual certificates can teach 
it is simply a shame that the brightest among you men and women 
here tonight coming out of science wanting to give of yourselves 
to teach the kids couldnt qualify because you didnt have the 
required number of formal education degrees he said it is time 
we take a new look and permit those who want to give of themselves 
to teach in our public schools 
bush joked about the impending birth of pups to the millie the 
first familys dog 
speaking of his wife barbara millies principal caretaker who 
joined him at the head table bush said this is the most relaxed 
ive seen bar since our dog got pregnant 
he said that when he asked his wife if she would join him on his 
thursdayfriday trip to colorado and texas she replied that she 
wouldnt dream of it with the english springer spaniel expecting to

the controversy over a 1985 crash in newfoundland 
that killed 256 americans was revived wednesday with the leaking of 
a transport department report questioning the conclusions of the 
official investigation 
the canadian aviation safety board concluded after a threeyear 
investigation that ice on the planes wings probably caused it to 
crash 
but the ottawa citizen reported wednesday that an internal report 
by the transport department or transport canada rejected the 
safety boards majority conclusion and said the investigation was 
mismanaged 
the transport canada review does not substantiate the 
conclusion that the aircraft stalled probably due to 
icecontaminated wings the citizen quoted the report as saying 
it is the opinion of the aviation safety programs branch that the 
cause of this accident is considered to be undetermined 
transportation minister benoit bouchard announced last week he 
had accepted the boards conclusion he ruled out a judicial inquiry 
into the boards handling of the investigation 
sandra wood spokesman for transport canada said bouchard made 
his statement last week based on recommendations from aides and did 
not know about the critical study 
claude lafrance an assistant deputy transport minister told a 
news conference he ordered the transport canada study in december 
but he said he didnt tell the minister or deputy minister about it 
when bouchard was briefed on the departments response to the 
boards report on the crash 
lafrance said his study despite its sharp criticisms of the 
safety boards investigation did not mean to secondguess the 
gander report 
we were looking for anything else that we might use to promote 
aviation safety he said 
lafrance didnt answer questions about what authority the 
department has to do a detailed review of the board report in 
practice the department is only supposed to review the boards 
safety recommendations 
bruce pultz a member of the safety board which was formed in 
1983 to carry out investigations independently of transport canada 
blamed the study on bureaucratic infighting 
he said transport canada didnt have the evidence to be able to 
reject the icing conclusion 
they keep trying to discredit us to get themselves more 
power pultz said 
ken thorneycroft head of the safety board said he had not read 
the transport canada report and had no idea such a report even 
existed 
he said his boards report into the gander crash was not flawed 
in any way and emphasized the investigative team did not arrive at 
the crash site with preconceived notions of the cause of the 
accident 
a judicial inquiry would not shed any additional light on the 
cause of the accident he said 
the crash on dec 12 1985 at gander newfoundland killed 248 
us servicemen returning to fort campbell ky from the middle 
east and eight american crew members of the arrow air charter dc8 
since then it frequently has been the subject of dispute 
the final report on the crash was approved by five of the boards 
members four supported the minority conclusion that an inflight 
fire or explosion was the cause 
brian tobin transportation critic in the chamber of deputies for 
the opposition liberal party said the latest controversy showed a 
judicial inquiry is needed to determine the cause of the gander 
crash and whether the safety board carried out the investigation 
properly

cheering crowds and a blaring siren greeted 
joe runyan on wednesday when he and 11 dogs pulled into this 
historic gold mining town to claim the 17th annual iditarod trail 
sled dog race 
it took the nenana musher slightly more than 11 days to cover the 
1168 miles from anchorage his wife and baby watched as he won 
50000 of the 250000 purse to be shared by the first 20 finishers 
the victory gave runyan 40 the triple crown in 
longdistance dog mushing last year he won the alpirod the more 
sedate european version of the iditarod and in 1985 he won the 
1000mile yukon quest from whitehorse yukon territory to 
fairbanks 
runyan said his dogs were in good shape after the grueling trek 
weve gone over 200 miles in 24 hours he said the alaska 
husky is unlike any animal on earth they can go 100 miles a day on 
rough terrain and they can take it 
runyan snapped a threeyear winning streak by susan butcher of 
manley but failed by about three hours to break her 1987 record 
time when he crossed the finish line butcher was about five miles 
behind the only other musher to win more than one iditarod is 
fourtime champion rick swenson of two rivers who was running 
fourth when runyan finished 
runyan who runs a kennel about 50 miles from fairbanks said his 
main goal simply was to reach the finish first i didnt care 
about the record he said theres always room for finehoning 
next year 
butcher who came in second an hour and four minutes behind 
runyan had struggled to keep up after beating him by two minutes at 
the race halfway point of iditarod for which she won 3000 in 
silver ingots only once in race history has the halfway winner gone 
on to victory 
illnesses among her dogs made it difficult to run a stronger 
race butcher said at the finish line the problems included 
diarrhea and leg disorders that required her to bandage some of the 
animals 
she gave each of her 11 dogs a congratulatory pat after pulling 
into the finish chute im really proud of them butcher said 
runyan arrived in white mountain about 77 miles from the finish 
early wednesday swenson arrived in white mountain an hour before 
runyan left but said runyans team was just too strong for him to 
catch 
my goal now is to get it over with said swenson who trailed 
butcher dee dee jonrowe of willow and lavon barve of wasilla were 
fourth and fifth respectively 
im kind of feeling sorry for how we have to run the dogs at 
the end jonrowe said tuesday i had to drop my leader his foot 
was sore 
fortynine mushers left the starting line in anchorage on march 
4 eight scratched along the way 
nome the last town of any size before the international date 
line took on a party atmosphere tuesday helped by sunny skies and 
temperatures that rose to the 20s 
workers in nome which has 4300 people and looks out over the 
frozen norton sound moved snow onto front sreet normally swept 
clean for traffic in anticipation of the mushers arrival 
volunteers at the iditarod office a block away updated race 
standings from reports submitted by ham radio operators along the 
trail 
i think author jack london put it best its the call of 
the wild volunteer peter elstub said 
elstub a british soldier said he had come to alaska for eight 
of the last 17 races in 1987 when he was on duty in the falkland 
islands he telephoned iditarod headquarters for race updates he 
said 
for locals the iditarod days give people a reason to be 
outside and just walk around town and see what happened all winter 
long while they were holed up in their houses said mary knodel a 
shopkeeper whose store overlooks the finish line 
marylou haggren a kodiak resident said she and her husband made 
hotel reservations a year ago for iditarod week in nome 
we just got back from the lower 48 and down there everyones 
talking basketball mrs haggren said as she lingered in the 
iditarod office different lifestyles i guess

the government presented its new 
budget wednesday with a blunt warning that south africans face 
rising taxes and a higher cost of living 
every south african will have to make a sacrifice in the battle 
against an economic onslaught which is being organized against the 
country internationally said finance minister barend du plessis 
in a speech to parliament referring to antiapartheid sanctions 
the budget totaling 636 billion rand or 254 billion is up 
125 percent from last year and the biggest allocations once again 
are for the military and education 
defense spending is projected at 36 billion up 137 percent 
and total spending for education is projected at 47 billion an 
increase of 19 percent 
du plessis announced that the general sales tax already one of 
the worlds highest would rise from 12 percent to 13 percent and 
said excise taxes on liquor and cigarettes also would increase 
he said the unacceptably high 1988 inflation rate which 
averaged 129 percent was certain to increase in 1989 experts have 
forecast a 15 percent inflation rate later this year 
total revenues are projected at 2164 billion with a third 
coming from the general sales tax and the fuel tax du plessis said 
the deficit would be 41 percent of the gross domestic product but 
he did not provide that projected figure 
regarding sanctions imposed on south africa to protest apartheid 
or the governments policy of racial separation du plessis said the 
economy has managed to survive but he conceded that opportunities 
for growth are being lost

a makebelieve fire swept 
the cabin of a space shuttle mockup wednesday and airmen posing as 
injured astronauts were evacuated by ground crews practicing for 
saturdays landing of the real shuttle discovery 
we want to ensure all our people are professionally trained and 
can respond to any emergency said joe dagostino airfield 
support coordinator for the national aeronautics and space 
administration our goal is to safely remove astronauts we like 
that good warm feeling 
the simulated shuttle landing emergency went well dagostino 
said nasa routinely conducts such exercises before real shuttle 
landings 
discovery is scheduled to end its fiveday mission by landing at 
634 am pst saturday at this mojave desert military base 80 miles 
north of los angeles 
saturday looks good for a landing with sunny skies and mild 
winds likely nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato said 
dagostino said discovery might touch down on a concrete runway 
to conduct braking and crosswind landing tests needed to pave the 
way for eventual resumption of shuttle landings at kennedy space 
center in florida shuttles normally land here on the 7milelong 
runway 17 an unpaved hardpacked clay surface strip at rogers dry 
lake 
about 200 nasa and air force personnel and 30 vehicles converged 
on concrete runway 22 to start wednesday afternoons mock landing 
exercise 
during the simulation ground crews pretended that a normal 
landing was followed immediately by a cabin fire inside the shuttle 
orbiter the five fake astronauts pretended to be incapacitated and 
were carried out by air force firefighters dagostino said they 
were placed aboard helicopters and flown over a nearby ridge as if 
they were being transported to a hospital he added 
were looking to see if the air force fire department can 
correctly extract the people agostino said 
discovery is scheduled to return to earth after orbiting earth 79 
times thats one less orbit than planned due to the onehour 
50minute delay in the shuttles launch monday caused by fog and 
strong highlevel winds at the kennedy space center 
lovato said edwards forecasters predicted unobstructed visibility 
and no rain saturday with scattered clouds at 25000 feet and 
northwest winds at about 12 mph until 8 am well after the 
scheduled landing increasing to 14 mph with gusts to 21 mph 
but fridays forecast calls for westnorthwest winds 23 mph 
gusting to 35 mph probably too high for a landing lovato said 
nasa prefers to land the shuttle on the runway 17 an unpaved dry 
lake where there is plenty of room for error if brake or steering 
problems develop if the lakebed is wet and muddy a paved runway at 
edwards is second choice followed by white sands missile range in 
new mexico and then the concrete runway at kennedy space center 
the lone shuttle mission diverted from edwards was the columbia 
on the third shuttle mission in march 1982 when rain turned the 
lakebed to muck and the colombia landed at white sands lovato said

the lights came back on the discovery space 
shuttle wednesday after mission control apparently fixed a 
troublesome hydrogen tank and told the astronauts not to worry about 
conserving energy 
discoverys five astronauts had switched off unnecessary lights 
and computers because of concern about erratic pressure readings 
from one of three hydrogen tanks aboard the shuttle the tank which 
helps supply electricity was taken out of service tuesday while 
engineers studied the problem 
the crew turned the tank back on wednesday morning but used only 
one of its two heaters mission control told the crew that early 
pressure readings showed the tank was working properly 
thats good news to hear replied discovery commander michael 
coats 
the hydrogen is combined with oxygen in the fuel cells to produce 
electricity for shuttle systems with water as a byproduct 
ground controllers were concerned that without use of the third 
hydrogen tank there may not be enough electricity to support a 
fiveday flight plus two days for contingencies 
but flight director chuck shaw said wednesday night that the tank 
operated properly with one heater all day meaning discovery is 
headed for a 634 am pst landing time saturday at edwards air 
force base calif as planned 
there are absolutely no problems at all shaw said adding 
that the tank would continue running while the astronauts slept 
the tank presented no constraints to flying all the way to the 
end of the mission and landing on saturday he said 
granvil pennington another flight director also said weather 
conditions for a saturday landing look very good 
earlier wednesday the astronauts were told they didnt have to 
continue to conserve electricity 
the astronauts could turn on lights and use them as they see 
fit 
similar erratic pressure readings were noted on the same hydrogen 
tank on discoverys flight last fall and posed no power problems to 
the vehicles operations pennington added 
nasa officials said the problem did not pose any safety threat to 
the crew 
the five astronauts went about the business of monitoring 
experiments and trying to photograph environmentally damaged areas 
of the earth including scars from a recent fire in the florida 
everglades and an erupting volcano in guatamala 
they also conducted medical tests on each other while floating 
on the flight deck dr james m bagian took coats blood pressure 
checked his pulse and pressed a small device to his temple to 
measure the blood flow in his head 
the tests were to help determine what effect zero gravity has on 
blood flow 
mission control awoke the crew with a full brass band rendition 
of the marine corps hymn 
we got two marines standing at attention up here joked 
coats a navy captain what do we do now 
astronauts james f buchli and robert c springer are marine 
colonels bagian is a physician and pilot john e blaha is an air 
force colonel 
discoverys primary mission deployment of a 100 million 
communications satellite was completed monday several hours after 
the shuttle rocketed into orbit 
the tracking and data relay satellite completes a network that 
will allow ground controllers almost unbroken radio contact with 
shuttles and other satellites the satellite deployed monday and 
another launched last year will provide the nearly continuous 
coverage while a third one above the earth will act as an inorbit 
spare 
the discovery flight is the first of seven shuttle missions 
planned this year and the 28th overall it also is the third shuttle 
flight since the challenger exploded and killed its seven astronauts 
more than three years ago

the us supreme court on wednesday 
stayed the execution of mass murderer r gene simmons who had 
scorned appeals of his death warrant after a fellow inmate asked 
the high court to intervene 
simmons was to be executed at 7 am thursday for killing 14 
members of his family at christmastime 1987 simmons convicted last 
month waived his appeals and would have been the first prisoner 
executed by arkansas in 25 years 
the other death row inmate jonas whitmore petitioned the us 
supreme court on tuesday to stop simmons execution whitmore 
concerned about the effect that simmons execution could have on his 
own case contended that the us constitution mandates an appeal in 
capital cases 
whitmore filed the petition with justice harry blackmun who 
referred the petition to the entire court which stayed the 
execution pending whitmores filing of a petition asking the court 
to review the simmons case 
should the court refuse to hear the case this stay terminates 
automatically the unsigned opinion said 
simmons and whitmore were not available for comment 
when prison officials told simmons that his execution would not 
be carried out as planned according to prison spokesman david 
white simmons was eating his requested last meal 
according to white simmons only reaction was to request if he 
could finish his dinner which at his request included a 
wellcooked filet six rolls six slices of cheese two raw sliced 
onions two tomatoes a banana and two 7ups 
judge john patterson who presided over the trial and set 
simmons execution date refused comment wednesday night 
arkansas gov bill clinton said the ruling came as a complete 
shock to me and i dont understand it 
then referring to a death sentence in another case against 
simmons for two murders in russelville ark the governor said 
ill move now to set the other execution date 
whitmores lawyer arthur allen said he was relieved by the 
courts ruling now we have adequate time to address some 
important constitutional issues he said its obvious the court 
realized an important issue was to be addressed here otherwise they 
wouldnt have issued the stay 
whitmores petition contends the federal constitution requires an 
appellate court to review a simmons conviction to keep the death 
penalty from being imposed arbitrarily the supreme court of 
arkansas on monday rejected whitmores petition by saying he lacked 
legal standing to address simmons rights 
the arkansas democrat a little rock newspaper published a 
letter wednesday from simmons in which he called arkansas death 
penalty ineffective 
one of the things i wanted to say in court which would have 
answered one of your questions is that arkansas does not have a 
meaningful death penalty it is a facade simmons wrote in 
response to questions contained in a note given to him after a march 
9 federal court hearing 
in an earlier case involving simmons the arkansas supreme court 
said the us constitution does not require an automatic appeal the 
court said there must be an appellate review of whether a prisoner 
sentenced to death is competent to waive his appeals on friday the 
arkansas supreme court ruled that simmons was competent when he 
waived his appeal last month 
simmons was arrested on dec 28 1987 in russellville after a 
shooting rampage that left two people dead when police went to his 
rural home near dover they found the 14 bodies of family members 
simmons was convicted last year of murdering the two russellville 
residents and sentenced to die that execution was stayed but that 
stay was lifted last week 
whitmore was convicted in the 1986 robberymurder of former 
montgomery county clerk essie may black 62 
simmons execution would be the 107th carried out since the 1976 
us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume use of the death 
penalty

a caller with a middle eastern accent told a 
radio station wednesday that a group called guardians of the islamic 
revolution was responsible for the bombing of a van driven by the 
wife of the uss vincennes skipper 
los angeles radio station knx said the person made the claim 
during a call to the newsroom wednesday morning the caller claimed 
to be a member of the group which also claimed responsibility for 
the crash of a pan am jetliner last year at lockerbie scotland 
station officials said the call was immediately reported to the 
fbi 
according to knx the caller said the group threatened to carry 
out additional attacks against vincennes skipper capt will c 
rogers iii and his family the caller also said the bombing was 
linked directly to last years downing of an iranian airliner by the 
vincennes 
fred reagan an fbi spokesman in los angeles confirmed that the 
bureau is investigating the call 
were looking into it reagan said he declined to elaborate 
guardians of the islamic revolution is an islamic group that made 
persistent claims to international news organizations that it was 
responsible for the crash of pan am flight 103 on dec 21 the crash 
killed 259 people aboard the plane and 11 on the ground 
a caller claiming to represent the group also warned on dec 30 
that if the united states did not deport reza pahlavi son of the 
former shah of iran there will be another present in the new year 
for america 
the group has previously claimed responsibility for a july 1987 
car bombing in london that wounded a former iranian cabinet 
minister more recently it threatened to kill british officials and 
a london talk show host over comments regarding ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis call to kill author salman rushdie 
rogers was commanding the vincennes last july when its crew 
mistook an iranian jetliner for an attacking warplane and shot it 
down with a missile killing all 290 people aboard 
he and his wife sharon have been under protection of navy 
security agents since fridays bombing of the family van 
mrs rogers who was driving to work alone escaped uninjured 
she got out moments before the van caught fire and burned at a busy 
san diego intersection because she thought the van had been bumped 
by the car behind her fire officials said 
rogers emerged from seclusion tuesday to take the helm of the 
vincennes as the fbi continued its investigation into the bombing 
summoning an expert in terrorist explosives 
rogers guided the ship out of the san diego naval station for 
routine daylong exercises off the coast a navy spokesman said 
fbi spokesman ron orrantia said no possible motives for the 
attack on the van have been ruled out including retribution for the 
airliner downing 
gregory jones an fbi spokesman in washington said its too 
early to be pinpointing the cause and culprits of this act 
fbi officials said the bomb was a nonmilitary device possibly a 
pipe bomb 
mrs rogers took the week off from her job as a fourthgrade 
teacher at a private school in la jolla

the first attempt to crystallize a virus in 
space is taking place aboard discovery as scientists use 
weightlessness to try to design better crops and new drugs against 
cancer aids emphysema and other diseases 
from the crystals we will be able to learn the structure of 
the virus said biochemist alexander mcpherson of the university of 
california riverside 
if we know the crystal structures of viruses we may be able to

the two men stood snapping at each other in the 
foyer of the southern baptist convention building in nashville 
tenn as about 45 people gathered around to listen 
it reflected in miniature the frayed emotions of a long and 
persistent conflict in the countrys largest protestant body between 
moderates and now dominant fundamentalists 
paul pressler an architect of the fundamentalist ascendancy 
told the rev richard jackson a phoenix moderate that his comments 
were an attack and a slur on my character 
you have no right to be so judgmental of me added pressler 
a houston appeals court judge you owe me an apology 
jackson countered i dont owe you an apology then he 
repeated four times you dont have one jackson who failed 
last year by a hairbreadth to win the presidency of the 148 
millionmember denomination added 
somebody finally needed to stand face to face with you and say 
these things 
the recorded flareup came late last month after a subcommittee 
recommended a fundamentalistpushed project to undercut 
interbaptist representation in washington by setting up a separate 
office 
however the hallway argument ranged over differences dating back 
over the last 10 years about presslers role as strategist for 
gaining fundamentalist predominance by successively winning the 
presidency since 1979 
the presidents appointive power determines trustees of the 
denominations huge network of agencies and institutions on a 
gradual basis and last years presidential outcome marked the shift 
to general fundamentalist control 
that includes a current majority of the central oversight body 
the executive committee which approved the subcommittees 
recommednation voting 4227 to set up the separate washington 
agency 
called the religious liberty committee it would serve as an 
alternative to the baptist joint committee on public affairs a 
longtime religious liberty watchdog for nine baptist bodies in the 
nations capital 
the plan provides that the denomination through its new arm 
would continue relationship with the interbaptist office but 
also run its own activities 
the action remains subject to two successive annual conventions 
the first one this june in las vegas nev 
fundamentalists have steadily criticized the joint agency 
especially for not advocating prayer in public schools nor opposing 
abortion the joint agency contends its mandate prevents involvement 
in the abortion debate 
the rev james m dunn the agencys executive director called 
the move to set up a separate southern baptist office 
shortsighted and divisive 
he said the joint agency has provided a consistent witness to 
religious liberty and will not compromise historic baptist 
convictions for a mess of politically tainted pottage 
this was only one of the issues festering in the denomination 
including status of its educational institutions 
one of them southeastern baptist theological seminary in wake 
forest nc has been found failing to meet accreditation 
standards following resignation of its former administration in 
protest at trustee changes 
a study committee of the southern association of colleges and 
schools said new requirements of belief in biblical inerrancy 
appears to have been arbitrarily imposed and responsibility of 
faculty curtailed 
biblical inerrancy is the yardstick pressed by 
fundamentalists now prevailing among institutional trustees and 
broadly applied through the denominations operations 
although insistence on this literalistic view of the bible 
powered the fundamentalist drive the rev milton ferguson 
president of midwestern baptist theological seminary in kansas city 
observes 
the real issue is no longer the bible but whether or not we 
can and will find ways to reestablish trust among ourselves 
moderates beaten out in the last decade of elections have 
sought mutual reinforcement in new independent organizations such as 
the southern baptist alliance a coalition of about 50 churches 
totalling 40000 
it insists on the soul competence of individuals to interpret 
the bible as they understand it an historic baptist principle 
the denominations past principles are in eclipse kirby 
godsey president of the denominations mercer university in macon 
ga told an alliance meeting last fall 
in the midst of these frightening shadows of denominational 
elipse we huddle together to find reassurance and light enough to 
sustain us he said we are baptists in a denomination that has 
stopped being baptist 
the alliance insists it doesnt presently plan any break from the 
denomination but is planning to help fund a new seminary not 
dominated by fundamentalists 
another unofficial group called baptists committed to the 
southern baptist convention was formed last december saying it 
represents the centrist mainstream of southern baptists 
we support the restoration of our convention not its 
destruction says the rev winfred moore of amarillo texas 
chairman of the group and twice unsuccessful candidate for the 
denominational presidency 
whether moderates will enter a presidential candidate in june 
after nine years of defeats remained uncertain but the 
fundamentalistbacked incumbent the rev jerry vines of 
jacksonville fla says he is open to reelection

mike connors televisions longtime good guy 
private eye and fbi agent finally bites the dust on screen in an 
episode of cbs murder she wrote 
let me tell you lying on the floor is the easiest acting ive 
ever done said connors 
connors who dodged bullets on tightrope mannix and 
todays fbi and is host of the syndicated show crimes of the 
century is the victim on sundays episode of murder she 
wrote the hit series stars angela lansbury as crimesolving 
mystery writer jessica fletcher 
he plays a screenwriter whos adapting one of jessicas books as 
a movie 
hes a throwback character a combination of humphrey bogart 
and john garfield said connors hes driving from las vegas and 
takes a detour and sees an old girlfriend slinging hash he says 
there she was a little worse for wear but still a hot cup of 
coffee to a thirsty guy like me 
we do some flashbacks in black and white then im shot and i 
grab a tape recorder and start telling the story of why i was shot 
its because of that style that i was intrigued with the show 
connors said the only other time he has been killed on screen was 
early in his career when he did a movie for roger corman 
he will also be seen in may when the final 12 hours of war and 
remembrance are telecast by abc he plays hack peters a colonel 
who is working on the atomic bomb and gets involved with rhoda 
henry the wife of pug henry 
his latest series is crimes of the century which recreates 
famous crimes from the lindbergh kidnapping to the yorkshire 
ripper in england 
whats so fascinating is not the crime but the information that 
comes up said connors information that might have changed the 
outcome of the case sam sheppard whose conviction in the 
bludgeoning death of his wife was later overturned claimed that he 
saw a bushyhaired man but the murder weapon believed to be fire 
tongs was never found 
his nextdoor neighbor was a bushyhaired man and after he died 
the new owner of the house was doing some digging and found the 
missing fire tongs 
the show began as two highly rated specials on abc but became a 
syndicated series because connors said abc news objected to a 
regular realitybased show produced outside the network 
connors starred on cbs as private detective joe mannix from 1967 
to 75 mannix began as an employee of a computerized detective 
agency but soon switched over to the traditional format joseph 
campanella was his boss the first year after that robert reed 
became his police contact and gail fisher was his secretary 
he said hes ready to do a mannix movie but paramount has 
turned down all requests so far 
i get a call from some independent producer about every six 
months he said im interested as long as the script and story 
is not childish but nothing ever happens paramount wont sell the 
rights nor will they do a movie all we want is a license to do a 
twohour movie 
his most recent feature film was the fistfighter and before 
that he starred in and produced too scared to scream anne 
archer costarred and tony lo bianco directed on location in new 
york that film took about two years of my life connors said 
he recently participated in a recording and video to benefit the 
victims of the earthquake in the armenian republic in the soviet 
union more than 100 performers took part in the recording 
connors is of armenian descent and occasionally explored his 
background in mannix he also made a pilot called ohanian 
which is his real name

you have life insurance health insurance home 
insurance car insurance that covers all the bases right 
well maybe not it might just be that you arent protected 
against another common risk that you could suffer some disability 
that prevents you from keeping your job 
any agent who sells disability insurance can quote you daunting 
figures about the accidents and ills that befall people ending 
their working careers or keeping them out of work for extended 
periods 
statistics show that even at age 60 a person is more likely to 
be disabled for more than 90 days than die prematurely says 
william brennan who is not an insurance salesman but who edits the 
newsletter financial planning reporter for the accounting firm of 
ernst amp whinney 
what few people appreciate are the severe economic consequences 
of a disability wages can be lost substantial uninsured medical 
expenses incurred even the childrens education may be sacrificed 
if you have not considered this question before now advisers on 
matters of personal finance say the answer is not to panic and run 
out to buy the first disability policy you can find 
rather they suggest setting some time aside to assess where your 
present disability protection stands and what if anything you need 
to do to improve it 
many people assume that if they are disabled they will get 
something from social security state disability insurance programs 
and their employer to tide them over 
in fact they may indeed stand to get benefits from any or all of 
those sources perhaps you also have a large amount of savings put 
aside in the event of what used to be spoken of euphemistically as 
a rainy day 
if a careful calculation shows that these sources together would 
keep your family solvent should some major disaster befell you then 
you may not need to bother with any further insurance thats nice 
because private disability insurance isnt cheap 
but if the numbers dont add up quite so nicely and youre the 
the only wageearner in a household with three children under the 
age of 6 an expert might advise you that disability income is a 
product for you 
in that event you need to do some shopping not just to compare 
premium rates but to give careful study to the details of available 
policies a primary issue to consider how the insurer defines 
disability 
says brennan steer clear of policies that only provide 
benefits if youre unable to perform duties of any occupation more 
liberal policies define disability as the inability to perform the 
duties of your particular occupation 
in addition he says you should determine that the policy cant 
be canceled or the premiums increased as long as you continue to pay 
them on time 
other matters to investigate include whether the policy provides 
any inflation protection since you may need to rely on it for many 
years and whether it covers a partial disability that reduces but 
doesnt eliminate your livelihood 
most policies specify a waiting period say 30 days between 
the onset of the disability and the start of benefits the cost of 
the premiums can be reduced substantially by increasing the waiting 
period 
as you might have guessed brennan concludes the more 
liberal the definition of disability the higher the premium costs 
dont let the costs scare you away however disability 
insurance fills a huge gap which could be left in an otherwise 
carefully constructed financial plan

the tight labor market can be observed in various 
ways through ones own observations by reading the labor 
departments latest job survey and by listening to concerns of 
smallbusiness owners 
personal observation such as in a visit to a fastfood outlet 
might be most convincing remember when smart eager young workers 
rushed to serve you service now isnt quite what it was its a 
real problem for the industry 
the latest labor department job survey offers documentation of 
the tightening of the supply of workers in february civilian 
unemployment declined to 51 percent a 14year low while 
employment rose by 290000 jobs 
but even more significant is the breakdown the jobless decline 
was almost solely among those age 16 years to 24 years where skills 
are limited and the job gains were in companies that produce 
services rather than goods 
reflecting these trends are the concerns of smallbusiness 
operators as indicated by responses from 1600 businesses most of 
whom employ fewer than nine workers to a survey by national small 
business united 
asked to name the three major problems facing their businesses 
the survey respondents gave the following rankings 
1 government regulations 
2 labor quality educational level of workers and job training 
3 labor and payroll costs 
the first concern isnt surprising small businesses long have 
felt oppressed by the enormous number of government regulations that 
impact their businesses and add oppressive paperwork requirements 
the next two arent especially surprising either everyone knows 
small businesses constantly worry about labor costs and other labor 
issues such as losing good workers after spending many dollars and 
months training them 
what is surprising is the position these labor issues occupy 
outranking such concerns as federal taxes competition interest 
rates capital costs and state and local taxes all major worries 
for years 
and while it isnt identified specifically as a labor issue the 
fourthranked item reflects the tightening labor market it is 
insurance costs not just liability insurance as in the past but 
health insurance as well 
when it is tough to get good workers as it is now small 
businesses are forced to meet competition not just by raising wages 
but by offering other inducements too and one of the most effective 
is health insurance 
the survey found that one of the most significant differences 
from 1987 to 1988 was the rising level of benefits offered by small 
business at the top was health insurance seventyseven percent 
offered it in 1987 91 percent in 1988 
small businesses are especially sensitive to labor changes 
because theirs is the job of training entrants to the world of 
commercial work and to a great extent the smaller the business the 
greater the sensitivity and vulnerability 
those responding to this survey generally were very small more 
than 88 percent said they had fewer than 50 workers the majority 
reported annual sales of less than 5 million and 25 percent had 
sales below 250000 
all respondents are members of national small business united 
which grew from a merger of the national small business association 
and the council of smaller enterprises whose membership included 
regional advocacy groups

the tiny indian girl was beyond help 
just three months old she was blind severely dehydrated and 
stricken with pneumonia the babys illness her mother said began 
with a compliment 
its a superstition here that if somebody tells you your baby 
is pretty something bad will happen to it said pamela lear a 
nurse practitioner from greenville ky and a 1st lieutenant in the 
kentucky national guard 
the baby also was coated with dried herbs when her mother brought 
her to the mountaintop clinic a zahorin or traditional healer 
had tried in the ancient mayan way to ward off the spirits believed 
to be afflicting the child 
to lear and lt col paula maionchi a richmond ky physician 
it was obvious that something bad had surely happened it was 
equally obvious that it had nothing to do with compliments and 
curses 
it had to do with severe vitamin a deficiency debilitating 
diarrhea intestinal parasites and the tragic decision of a young 
mother in an isolated society to turn first to a medicine man for 
help maionchi arranged the babys transfer to a hospital two hours 
away in guatemala city she died en route 
it was the gravest illness that the 475th mobile army surgical 
hospital and 973rd dental detachment would face this day in the 
sierra madre where the guards spent part of a twoweek training and 
humanitarianaid mission 
in a larger sense the childs illness was a severe example of 
problems that are widespread in a mayan population where infant 
mortality is high life expectancy is low and the time in between is 
arduous half of guatemalas 77 million residents are descendants 
of the mayans 
lear and capt douglas stevens a lexington ky physician were 
seeing ailments they didnt encounter at home including 
tuberculosis in young people parasitic diseases were rampant 
malnutrition and bronchitis were common 
up to 80 percent of mayan children die before their first 
birthdays said col michael mcconnell chief surgeon of the us 
armys southern command the guards were seeing the ones that made 
it through said mcconnell who observed the training and 
treatment here and at choatulum and chemachoy 
at each site the guards set up shop in a tiny clinic of a 
standard government design three small examining rooms off a 
compact waiting area the clinics were equipped with cold water and 
almost nothing else 
the clinic in xepatan was without heat or light capt david 
obanion a louisville dentist and sgt charisse newton a 
frankfort dental technician extracted teeth by the light of 
batterypowered head lamps 
at choatalum the line of patients was long but dr joseph dobner 
wasnt seeing unusual cases the tiny bulletriddled building in 
which he set up his clinic however was a far cry from his 
frankfort office part of the roof had been blown away and the 
windows shattered electricity came from a generator so loud that 
i cant listen to the lungs so we tend not to use it 
im hightech in a very lowtech situation said dobner a 
lieutenant colonel in the 475th mash and an orthopedic surgeon 
when you put any organization through a rigorous situation 
theyre going to learn and its going to forge them into a more 
cohesive unit and they learn how to work with adversity and boy 
were working with adversity 
the mayans also have suffered from guatemalas 30yearold civil 
war government critics say the military engaged in a scorched 
earth campaign to rid the countryside of rebels and their 
potential supporters among indians 
national guard units from iowa and georgia preceded kentuckys 
under an agreement with the guatemalan government each exercise was 
conducted with the army medical corps ministry of health and the 
animal health agency 
like his colleagues dobner spent his time treating parasitic 
infections lung ailments and dispensing ointments and pain 
relievers for countless aching joints and muscles that are the 
legacy of life in the rugged sierra madre 
im amazed at these people you dont see much in the way of 
major orthopedic problems because theyre dead they dont have a 
chance if theyre at all infirm theyre gone dobner said 
there is no training opportunity that even comes close to 
this at home said maj allen youngman assistant chief of staff 
this is an opportunity to do something right that maybe we havent 
done right in the past 
for maj beverly vance an eastern kentucky university nursing 
instructor it was the most gratifying experience ive ever had 
it will make my unit better support of the operation is not 
what it should be but it never is dobner said because 
pharmaceutical needs change with the seasons the mission also 
taught the southern command a few things 
the unit was learning to do without medical supplies that were 
either in short supply or were used up rapidly he said everyone 
seeking treatment at choatalum had head lice for example and 
antilice medicine was quickly gone 
three days into the exercise and we were out of something that 
would make life lots better but the last group down here from the 
georgia guard didnt use what they had because it was a different 
season he said 
the stoicism of the mayans was underscored at xepatan where 
obanion and newton averaged about two extractions per patient the 
only practical treatment under the circumstances for scores with 
rotted teeth 
one of the patients a slightly built 27yearold man had a 
badly abscessed tooth he probably was seeing for the first time a 
long needle like the one used to shoot anesthesia into his gums but 
he didnt flinch 
they live with chronic pain the needle is no big deal 
obanion said 
but the acidity of the mans infected gum tissue negated the 
anesthetic and he soon was in obvious pain he clenched the sides of 
the examining table as obanion worked to extract a tooth that was 
shattering with each touch 
its like trying to take a piece of glass out of concrete he 
said you just have to be patient and work at it hell feel 
noticeable improvement after a couple of hours 
his ordeal over the patient eased himself off the table plunked 
a battered hat on his head and moved toward the door there he 
paused and gave a broad wave to obanion and newton 
obanion nodded in return 
another satisfied customer he said

george a 36yearold former heroin addict who 
beat his wife is lying to himself 
the last altercation got out of hand but before i could 
wrestle the knife from my wifes hand six cops busted in the door 
and arrested me they didnt even want to listen to my side of the 
story 
george can tell his story when hes at the queens family conflict 
center among six other men who have inflicted violence on their 
households 
i dont know how hard i hit when i get angry he says how 
can i stay without drugs when the person lying in bed is sniffing 
all the coke in town if i continue to be passive shes going to 
bring me down 
shes the one who has to get help or else im getting a 
divorce 
if shes the one who needs help for her cocaine problem then 
why are you here interrupted group leader jerome balcom balcom 
explained later that george kept on straying away from the fact 
that he hit his wife 
more than 18 million women will be punched kicked or assaulted 
with a weapon this year according to a university of new hampshire 
family research lab study about 625 million will be slapped or 
shoved 
that is assuming everyone we interviewed told all said lab 
director murray a straus in my judgment those figures should be 
doubled 
experts say protective court orders may give victims of domestic 
violence temporary security but the only prevention lies in 
education 
lack of communication between the sexes and the inability to 
communicate without violence causes the abuser to react in the only 
way he knows how said ellie ludvigsenjennings of the city 
probation department 
the abusive male is rigid toward sex roles and has a poor 
selfimage and an inability to communicate with his spouse said 
roland maiuro a psychologist and director of the harborview anger 
management program in washington state 
seventyfive percent are drug or alcohol addicts and 98 percent 
were sexually abused or beaten as children said ludvigsenjennings 
we try to stop the pattern before it gets to the point of adult 
abuse 
we also help victims and adolescents because once they are 
abused they just like the men will have the tendency to abuse as 
well 
our goal is to eliminate family violence 
ludvigsenjennings and balcom commander of court officers for 
the state court in westchester county started the conflict center 
in 1984 in response to an increase in domestic violence in new york 
city its six fulltime staffers and 20 volunteers run 15 programs 
on issues linked to family violence including parenting alcohol 
and drug addiction and child abuse 
about 4000 men have participated in five years some 
voluntarily others under court order 
we try to see them the same day they are referred 
ludvigsenjennings said you cant treat violence cases like any 
other cases they need immediate intervention or somebody will get 
seriously hurt 
the aim is to make the abuser understand why he is angry and 
teach him how to deal with that aggression we first teach them 
that they are responsible for their actions that they are wrong to 
hurt their wives and they should learn to think before acting 
said ludvigsenjennings 
most men dont realize what they have done is wrong she said 
the man sees the woman as someone beneath him someone who should 
obey his rules when she doesnt he feels he has every right to 
make her act accordingly 
when we first get them they are full of denial balcom said 
they dont believe theyve done anything wrong and theyll justify 
it until theyre blue in the face 
george was typical he was trying to blame his wifes drug 
habit for their altercations instead of looking at why he was angry 
at her 
group leaders try to convince men they should walk away when they 
feel a situation is getting out of control eventually the abuser 
should be able to let his wife know when he is approaching a 
breaking point so she can leave before it is too late 
the breaking point according to balcom can come at any time 
but usually is after the wife becomes independent of the husband 
sometimes the wife goes to school gets a better job advances 
herself then the man feels inferior less in control and less 
needed by the wife 
counselors try to replace aggressiveness with assertiveness 
you cant expect an abuser to miraculously be cured of all his 
aggressions in a sixweek program it takes time to undo what years 
of abuse have done said ludvigsenjennings if the abuser is 
caught early enough his anger can be controlled but the more 
entrenched the pattern of violence the greater the possibility it 
wont be reversed 
spouse abuse is not at its root a marital problem it is an 
anger problem and even if the couple separates he will most likely 
lash out again she said by not addressing the issue of learning 
different ways of seeing ones self and the opposite sex and not 
addressing the issue of what family violence does we are dumping 
more people into the criminal court system

down in the hill country of south texas a 
craftsman with a fancy for symbolism pursues that ancient way of 
conveying faith expressing it in signs and images 
theyre myriad kinds a fish circle dove greek letters 
flames a flower anchor crown a cross 
i had something i wanted to say thats important to me and i 
wanted to share it with others says james avery 67 whose 
company at kerrville texas turns out religiously symbolic jewelry 
i know these things are strengthening to people he said in a 
telephone interview telling of many letters received affirming it 
and special requests for items in times of crisis 
pictorial art and symbols were until the 15th century invention 
of the printing press the main representation for common people of 
christianity registered in church sculptury figures and mosaics 
but in modern times such indirect religious expression has 
become less prominent along with a shift away from decorative 
churches with the meaning of many symbols often not known 
its a sometimes forgotten but powerful language avery said 
however his output of symbolbearing pins rings pendants key 
chains necklaces bracelets earrings and other items in silver and 
gold has grown from a oneman shop in his garage to a 22 
millionayear business 
it includes besides his main design and handcrafting center on 
a treeclad hillside at kerrville 22 retail stores mostly in texas 
and oklahoma plus an extensive mailorder trade and employs about 
600 people 
i didnt get into this to make money he said relating how 
he turned to it at a stressful point in his own life to find a 
simpler more constructive way of living 
at that time the milwaukeeborn avery then a fine arts 
professor at the university of colorado had been without religious 
faith his first marriage collapsed 
it started me doing some pretty heavy thinking he said i 
was trying to get back on a track with some values and that were 
lasting he returned to the episcopal church which he had 
abandoned in his college days 
now a a very strong committed christian he said 
there is no help in us ourselves it comes from the outside 
you cant stare at your navel and get it it comes from without 
from god himself thats where the healing and help comes from 
settling in 1954 in kerrville northwest of san antonio he hung 
a sign on his garage james avery craftsman the name of his 
company ever since he wasnt even sure then just what crafting he 
would do 
as a world war ii air force bomber flier while still an 
agnositic he had carried a charm given him by an african native who 
said it would protect from boom boom he said he had prized it 
then 
indirectly it may have figured in his turning to crafting 
religiously symbolic jewelry at 2 an hour for his work plus 
materials he took in only 5500 the first year but demand for his 
pieces spread mostly at first by wordofmouth 
now bigtime he said what mattered was the note of faith and 
beauty in his pieces this is where its at this is what living 
is all about what christ was talking about where freedom is 
his companys output includes 196 different types of christian 
crosses from various periods and areas of the world plus many other 
symbols each piece includes a card explaining the scriptural or 
historical meaning 
some symbols used in averys jewelry that arent always clear 
beforehand to people include 
inri latin initials of inscription at the top of the cross at 
the crucifixon jesus of nazareth king of the jews 
butterfly eternal life dove holy spirit lily purity and 
chastity nail christs physical suffering rose prophecy 
triangle the trinity crossed keys keys to heaven given to st 
peter 
olive branch peace gods reconciliation with man shell 
baptism recalling the scallop shell or scallopshaped vessel used 
in pouring baptismal water lamb jesus anchor hope 
steadfastness 
chi rho greek initials of christ xp circle eternity flames 
holy spirit religious fervor martyrdom daisy christ child 
innocence grapes holy communion harp music glorifying god 
heart gods love 
ihs first three greek letters of jesus ihcoyc but when latin 
became the main language the greek c was changed to a latin s 
making the abbreviation ihs instead of ihc 
ichthus fish in greek early symbol of christ christianity 
was an underground movement for its first 300 years and christians 
would draw a fish as a secret sign of identity

setting aside a 1200year tradition 
of shipbuilding and trade the hearty germans who people this 
blustery port are turning to high technology to survive the 
withering of their waterfront 
undercut by asians who can build ships and package fish much 
cheaper the heavily unionized shipyards and factories that were the 
heartbeat of bremen have suffered a steady decline for more than a 
decade 
the 155percent unemployment rate borne by this stronghold of 
sailors and stevedores is nearly twice the national average it 
marks bremen as one of the bleak counterpoints to the economic 
success stories in west germanys south 
bremens industrial and government leaders say the solution is a 
complete personality change for the hanseatic port that has been 
focused on the sea since its founding in the 8th century 
they see the citys future in the hightechnology industries that 
already have found a foothold among the wharves and drydocks on the 
weser river about 35 miles inland from the north sea 
but even the most optimistic of bremens economic forecasters 
concede that a radical reversal of the downward trend is unlikely 
we have no room for expansion ortwin baum director of 
bremens association of employers said in an interview that is 
the great disadvantage we have in trying to compete with other 
states for new business 
the city of bremen which under west germanys mazelike 
governmental structure also ranks as a state is already chockablock 
with factories wharves and trim rows of postwar townhouses 
accommodating the citys 540000 residents 
there are also the disincentives of high business taxes 
inadequate public transport empty city coffers and a work force 
with more back muscle than computer knowhow 
despite the heavy odds against a swift change from bluecollar to 
whitecollar industries the outlook for the automobile aviation 
and space industries represented here holds a promise of enough 
expansion to compensate for the further cutbacks expected in heavy 
industry 
while bremens economy may not get better soon no one expects it 
to get much worse 
bremen is reducing its dependence on classical old industries 
like shipbuilding and fishprocessing said uwe beckmeyer 
bremens state minister for economics technology and trade the 
resettlement of hightechnology enterprises and research facilities 
here will create 3000 new jobs by the turn of the century 
much of the expansion will be among the industrial giants like 
daimlerbenz which produces mercedes cars and other hightech 
companies like krupp atlas electronics and the 
messerschmidtboelkowblohm enterprise involved in air and space 
transport production 
its true that bremen is going to be seeing new work places 
opening up in the hightechnology fields but im not convinced they 
will be plentiful enough to counteract the losses in the marine 
industries said dagmar lill head of state governments labor 
department weve seen about 20000 jobs disappear in bremen over 
the past 10 years or so and that has created a problem with 
longterm unemployment that these new jobs will not resolve 
local government and private organizations have been created over 
the past few years to address bremens labor crisis but ms lill 
says there is little hope of retraining the over40 manual laborers 
from the waterfront who are the first laid off by the troubled 
shipyards and steel mills for the kinds of jobs that will be 
available in the future 
west german social security provides experienced workers who are 
laid off with 68 percent of their previous salaries which older and 
unskilled workers often find sufficient to live on 
about onefourth of the jobless population is under 25 and the 
younger unemployed stand a better chance of gaining entrance into 
governmentfunded training programs than their elders who are often 
content to stay on the government dole 
renee seehof directs the 5yearold bremen unemployed selfhelp 
agency bras which uses public funds to hire 200 young bremens and 
train them for the specialized positions expected to open in the 
region 
there are so many similar assistance groups in each 
neighborhood and church and social agency that its hard to believe 
that those who want to learn a new trade cant find an opportunity 
to do so ms seehof said 
the sorry state of bremens finances has forced the closure of 
some schools and other public services triggering strikes and 
encumbering more of the population with personal debts 
the liberal social democrats have governed bremen throughout the 
postwar period and the conservative christian democrats who govern 
nationally are under fire on grounds that they failed to rescue 
bremen 
the turmoil thus has fueled the rise of a small but vocal 
ultrarightist faction in bremen which is the seat of west 
germanys largest radical rightwing organization the combined 
german national democratic party and the german peoples union 
we will be running a full list of candidates in the next 
elections 1990 the partys press spokesman karlheinz vorsatz 
said we can only expect even broader support when the economic 
situation is as bad as it is

big political names like walter f mondale 
pete du pont and lamar alexander are attracting renewed attention as 
party leaders try to recruit starquality candidates in their 
efforts to tip the balance in 1990 senate races 
success in recruiting a mondale du pont or alexander could force 
an otherwise safe incumbent into a tossup race for reelection 
for example if democrats succeed in convincing mondale to run 
for the senate republican sen rudy boschwitz of minnesota would 
shift from being a good bet for reelection to being an endangered 
incumbent 
the 1990 senate elections also offer some tempting targets for 
republican recruiters looking for a chance to embarrass potential 
1992 democratic presidential contenders 
high on that list was sen sam nunn of georgia the democrat who 
led the fight to defeat president bushs nomination of john tower to 
be secretary of defense 
its about time we had a strong opponent against mr nunn 
said lee raudonis executive director of the georgia republican 
party a goal easier contemplated than achieved nunn received 80 
percent of the vote in 1984 and 83 percent six years before that 
also on that list were democrats albert gore jr of tennessee 
joseph biden of delaware and bill bradley of new jersey 
but the main focus in 1990 will be control of the senate rather 
than the white house 
there is virtually no chance the republicans can regain next year 
the majority they lost in 1986 democrats now control the senate by 
a margin of 55 to 45 and of the 33 seats contested next year 17 
are now held by republicans and 16 by democrats 
republican dreams of narrowing the democratic hold on the senate 
were jolted this winter when two gop incumbents regarded as sure 
bets for reelection william armstrong of colorado and gordon 
humphrey of new hampshire announced they wouldnt run again 
three other republicans considered possibilities to join the 
ranks of voluntary retirements were jesse helms of north carolina 
nancy kassebaum of kansas and mark hatfield of oregon 
on the democratic side no incumbent is expected to step down 
voluntarily 
ironically democratic efforts to recruit former north carolina 
gov jim hunt to run for the senate could have the effect of 
convincing helms to seek another term 
helms beat back a challenge from hunt in 1984 a contest that was 
not only one of the most bitter in memory but also still ranks as 
the most expensive senate race in history helms spent nearly 17 
million and hunt almost 10 million 
friends of mondale describe the 1984 democratic presidential 
candidate as agonizing over whether to challenge boschwitz a 
decision mondale has said he would make this summer 
the former vice president and senator is getting conflicting 
advice from former aides some of whom argue that a boschwitz 
challenge would be very expensive and difficult to win despite early 
polls that give mondale a ninepoint lead others argue that mondale 
ought to run because he yearns to return to public service and they 
are convinced that although the race would not be easy he would win 
basil battaglia the delaware republican chairman said he has 
talked to du pont about challenging biden 
that would be a classic race he said while not sounding 
optimistic that it will take place du pont was a popular twoterm 
governor of delaware and was an early contender for the 1988 gop 
presidential nomination 
pete has never been receptive to the united states senate for 
some reason said battaglia he has always shied away from it 
in tennessee gop party official tommy hopper was no more 
optimistic about convincing former gov lamar alexander to take on 
gore 
he probably wouldnt consider it hopper said of alexander 
who now is president of the university of tennessee 
was anyone else considering a gore challenge 
i dont know anybody whos looking at it said hopper 
greg edwards executive director of the new jersey republican 
party couldnt name a highvisibility prospect to challenge 
democratic sen bill bradley 
i have not been a party to any discussions about candidate 
recruitment for the senate race he said nor have i heard of 
any potentials mentioned 
republicans may have better luck persuading rep claudine 
schneider to run against veteran democratic sen claiborne pell of 
rhode island schneider resisted attempts to get her to challenge 
pell in 1984 and is giving no hints what she might do this time 
a republican in the category of a shooin unless was sen 
john warner of virginia the only potential stumbling block in his 
path was gov gerald baliles whose term ends in january 1990 
despite the hunger georgia republicans have for seeing nunn 
forced to work for reelection the prospects arent high 
there hasnt been a meeting of the long knives to go out and 
try to find someone said raudonis when asked about the prospects 
of a strong challenge to nunn 
he listed mack mattingly the republican who served one senate 
term and then was beaten for reelection in 1986 as a formidable 
candidate 
im sure there are others around said raudonis i just say 
we havent gone out and tried to find anybody yet

after more than a decade former homicide 
detective bob grogan still gets angry when he recalls the murders of 
10 young women the subject of the nbc movie the case of the 
hillside stranglers 
his bostonirish accent takes on an indignant tone as he 
remembers the victims whose nude and tortured bodies were abandoned 
on hillsides in 197778 and their families 
grogan whose investigation helped break the case is portrayed 
by richard crenna in the twohour movie airing sunday 
dennis farina plays angelo buono one of two men convicted of the 
killings and billy zale plays kenneth bianchi the other steven 
gethers directed and wrote the screenplay based on the book two of 
a kind the hillside stranglers by darcy obrien 
the killers first struck in october 1977 and within a week had 
claimed three victims but the bodies were left in various places 
and the deaths were investigated by the los angeles county sheriffs 
department glendale police and los angeles police 
it wasnt until two more bodies were found one weekend that a 
connection was made 
the following week ralph salerno of the sheriffs department 
roger brown of glendale and i began comparing notes said grogan 
we were pretty well convinced they were all connected 
the key grogan said was a telltale mark all the bodies had on 
the neck wrists and ankles 
the marks were like a blueprint he said thereafter 
whenever a new body was found we could tell if it was connected by 
the ligature marks 
we began to suspect two people were involved after the murder 
of judy miller her body appeared to have been lifted and placed 
rather than tossed and rolled 
the killing of lauren wagner produced a witness who had seen two 
men stop her on a street outside her home 
thats when grogan and the other officers began to believe the 
killers were either police officers or were posing as police 
officers the bodies had no defensive trauma he said there 
was no evidence of a struggle which indicated they had convinced 
the girls to come along until it was too late 
the various police departments under increasing public pressure 
to solve the cases organized a task force grogan believes the 
addition of uniformed policemen with no investigative experience 
impeded the case 
the primary investigators had to withhold key evidence he 
said polygraph keys we called them otherwise it would have 
been in the press in no time we need these key points to separate 
the real killers from the people confessing to the crimes but 
because of that the officers felt we didnt trust them 
bianchi was arrested in bellingham wash for two murders there 
the link to the hillside strangler murders was quickly made grogan 
makes a brief appearance in the movie as bellingham detective fred 
nolte 
bianchi pleaded guilty to the two murders in washington with the 
provision that the death penalty not be applied he also pleaded 
guilty to five murders in los angeles and became the primary witness 
against buono his cousin 
grogan a burly man with a red beard and moustache becomes most 
incensed when he recalls the preliminary hearing for buono and the 
subsequent trial 
after a 10month preliminary hearing with 125 witnesses 
deputy district attorney roger kelly moved to dismiss all 10 
charges he said he had the backing of district attorney john 
van de kamp now californias attorney general they didnt think 
they could win a major case because of kenneth bianchis credibility 
as a witness 
superior court judge ronald george refused to dismiss the charges 
and ordered california attorney general george deukmejian now the 
states governor to prosecute the case buono was convicted on all 
counts and is now serving a life sentence at soledad prison since 
the trial george has become an appellate judge 
grogan has retired after 27 years with the los angeles police and 
is now a private detective he does not handle criminal cases

the agriculture departments search for 
strange new ways to help small farmers has resulted in suggestions 
about production of exotic livestock goats herbs wildflowers 
mushrooms and other specialties 
the latest reports from the office for smallscale agriculture 
which is part of the cooperative state research service are about 
exotic fruits and socalled dessert vines 
editor george b holcomb is the author of the onesheet reports 
which bear the general title a smallscale agriculture 
alternative in other words each one offers potential 
opportunities for small farmers some could lead to big returns no 
guarantees though and there are pitfalls 
heres what the report on exotic fruits has to say 
certain potentially highdemand tropical or other exotic fruits 
growing in florida or california also have varieties that will bear 
fruit farther north but potential smallscale northern enterprisers 
should not buy seeds or seedlings from anyone until checking them 
out carefully with a horticulturist at their county or state 
extension office 
the growing demand for specialty fruits in most large cities 
means that skilled small producers may be able to compete with the 
big operators from new zealand central america and south america 
but that can be done only if growers select varieties carefully 
and master their marketing homework 
one of the possibilities is the kiwi fruit a native of new 
zealand that has caught on with many american consumers since it was 
introduced in the early 1960s california and florida are the 
centers of us kiwi production but there are some experiments with 
hardier varieties from south carolina on west 
while some fruits do well in one state and not in another a 
few like the feijoa a native of south america have also been 
adopted successfully by new zealanders floridians and 
californians the report said with some protection it too can 
be cultivated farther to the north but according to the latest 
reports it hasnt possibly because damaging fruit flies love it 
so 
the report lists names and addresses for specific marketing 
information about exotic fruit production 
in the second new report about dessert vines the watermelon and 
its cousins come into full glory with types and varieties that 
grocery shoppers perhaps never dreamed of a few years ago 
new diseaseresistant watermelons for example open up new 
possibilities for smallscale entrepreneurs who want to produce them 
for local markets 
it could mean a comeback for watermelons which were consumed 
at the rate of about 179 pounds per capita in the 1950s the 
report said the rate dropped to only 128 pounds in the 1970s 
the new assortment of hardier watermelons includes the 
miniatures the icebox melon that weighs 5 to 10 pounds also 
hybrids are being produced without seeds with some of these melons 
averaging about 15 pounds 
growers say that besides their resistance to the common 
diseases of anthracnose and fusarium wilt minimelons are firmer 
crisper and sweeter than other watermelons the report said 
whether size gives them a marketing advantage over their 20 to 
25pound cousins is a queston 
the report added supermarket dealers can make more money per 
melon by selling slices of large melons the small ones average more 
rind per pound than the big ones but the new minimelons reportedly 
hold up well in shipping even without refrigeration 
another dessert vine is the cantaloupe which are grown in many 
parts of the country and there are some varieties that will do 
better than others depending on location and other climatic factors 
county extension agents may give tips on marketing but they 
cant provide the extra labor that may be needed if a grower plants 
more than his family and available laborers can harvest haul and 
sell the report said 
in some cases pickyourown operations can be adapted to 
cantaloupe production and there are ways to design and improve 
roadside direct marketing sources of such information are provided 
in the report

dessert vines write to howard w kerr jr program director

editors note the academy award might be the most soughtafter 
prize in the movie world but even oscar or an oscar nomination 
hasnt been able to save some old movies from fading away 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gone wih the wind looks better than ever 
lawrence of arabia is a feast for the eyes the new print of 
casablanca has hardly a scratch 
but the rerelease of those academy awardwinning classics has 
overshadowed the fact that thousands of old films are in need of 
restoration or are damaged beyond repair 
curators from the nations four major preservation centers agree 
that quick and comprehensive action is needed they also see another 
problem emerging over the next few years the fading of color films 
the original negative of stagecoach the 1939 john ford 
western that made john wayne a star no longer exists and only 
inferior copies are available the same is true of the 1937 cary 
grantirene dunne comedy the awful truth which earned an oscar 
for director leo mccarey and the master of double indemnity 
billy wilders 1944 landmark film noir is incomplete it was 
nominated for best picture but lost to another mccarey production 
going my way 
until 1950 movies were printed on nitrate stock a highly 
flammable material that decomposes almost instantly and without 
proper care can disintegrate within a few years but when the 
negatives are transferred to acetate known as safety stock 
they can have a shelf life of 100 years or more if kept under 
climatecontrolled conditions 
i think with over 110 million feet of nitrate film held in the 
nations archives that are either unique copies or the best 
surviving ones we are very close to confronting a crisis said 
robert rosen director of uclas film and television archives all 
of this material unless its copied is going to be gone 
peter williamson preservation officer at the museum of modern 
art in new york cited other major problems we need additional 
funding because our funding levels have basically been frozen at a 
fixed dollar amount for the last 10 years he said also the 
laboratory capacity to correctly duplicate for preservation has 
undergone a dramatic shrinking fifteen years ago there were at 
least two dozen laboratories now were down to six or seven 
switching from one stock to the other costs the preservation 
centers 4060 cents per foot double the rate of 10 years ago 
meanwhile federal funding has stayed at 500000 during that time 
and with the government operating under a large budget deficit the 
prospects for increased revenues in the near future are dim 
im going to shoot for the same kind of funding that i had this 
year said rep sidney yates dill a major supporter of film 
preservation and a member of the house subcommittee on interior and 
related agencies 
i dont think theres a possibility of getting a real major 
increase of funding for any program under the current fiscal 
climate if perhaps we can get an inflation recognition an increase 
at the rate of inflation we will have been doing pretty well 
but even with financial assistance curators see another problem 
emerging over the next few years the fading of color films 
according to paul spehr the assistant chief of the library of 
congress motion picture broadcasting and recorded sound division 
the negatives for early color films have a shelf life of 3040 years 
and can be extended by cold storage 
since color first had widespread use in the 50s many original 
negatives are now ready to be transferred to the current more 
durable stock 
most of the colors fade very badly spehr said were at 
the point now where its beginning to see a crunch 
moving pictures first became popular at the turn of the century 
when people poured into nickelodeons and for 5 cents could watch 
images flicker by by the 20s such stars as charlie chaplin and 
mary pickford had helped make motion pictures a major industry but 
no one really thought those movies were worth saving 
according to williamson less than onethird of all silent movies 
remain the films of actress theda bara a major star from the 
silent era have almost completely vanished 
we have 12 to 15 million feet of nitrate and only about a third 
of that is preserved said ed stratmann the assistant curator in 
charge of preservation at the george eastman house in rochester 
ny time is running out for it 
movie studios have received mixed grades for their efforts in 
transferring stock curators praised turner entertainment which 
controls mgm rko and pre1949 warner bros films and walt disney 
studios for maintaining their libraries 
ted turner chairman and chief executive officer of turner 
broadcasting systems inc outraged the film community by colorizing 
the maltese falcon its a wonderful life and other 
classics however his company has done extensive restoration 
including the heavilypublicized gone with the wind project

according to dick may turners director of film services the 
entire mgm catalog about 1000 movies has been transferred to 
safety including 1938s the adventures of robin hood which was 
in danger of being lost forever 
there was no protection the safety negative wore out from use 
we had to go back to the original nitrate material may said 
disney has recently reissued the muchloved animated movies 
bambi and snow white and the seven dwarfs and is currently 
at work on a new print of fantasia 
we have in addition to the negative material the original 
artwork said paula sigman assistant archivist at the disney co 
if we want to do something special we can go back to the 
originalrelease versions all that material has been preserved 
mca which controls the universal and pre1948 paramount 
libraries has been less thorough two early marx brothers films 
the cocoanuts and horse feathers are available only in 
badly scratched versions double indemnity is also a paramount 
movie 
its not like there are any titles that have been lost because 
the nagative is incomplete but as far as what the quality would be 
theres no way of saying said john previti who supervises 
preservation of old universal and paramount titles the longer you 
wait the more of a risk there is all this nitrate has been sitting 
in the vault for years 
spehr was also less than satisfied with universals library 
we certainly dont have a full representation of their film 
production some films are in very bad shape they dont have 
the snap and sharpness you would like to see 
but all the dire predictions have produced a positive side 
effect an increased awareness of the importance of preservation 
projects are underway throughout the united states the library 
of congress is currently restoring the films of frank capra turner 
is at work on the fred astaireginger rogers musicals ucla has 
discovered a series of laurel and hardy films in spanish and the 
american film institute is putting together a comprehensive data 
base with information on all available prints and where the 
negatives can be found 
were working with the other archives in trying to pool a few 
things said stratmann who noted that the eastman house the 
museum of modern art and turner are collaborating on the restoration 
of the 1944 musical meet me in st louis 
spehr is encouraged too one of the things thats interesting 
is we detect a much stronger and broader interest in preservation in 
general more interests are being expressed from a wider variety of 
sources 
for rosen restoring old films goes beyond any entertainment 
value the movies might provide he sees it as a way of preserving 
history 
for the 20th century the moving image is in a real sense our 
collective memory he said its the popular art form most 
characteristic of our century its a way people measure their own 
lives

a campaign to preserve the remaining half of the 
worlds tropical rain forests has finally taken root but the task 
is enormous and the last gasp for the lungs of the earth could 
be less than a century away 
environmentalists are pleased with their initial success three 
years after they began challenging governments industries and 
banks but an area the size of a soccer field is destroyed each 
minute and the young preservation movement seeks fundamental 
changes in political economic and social structures to save the 
teeming jungles of south america africa and southeast asia 
an aggressive campaign of publicity education and confrontation 
began in 1985 and appeared to capture the worlds attention last 
year almost overnight it seemed world leaders began calling for 
greater efforts to halt the chopping and burning of rain forests 
conferences discussed such technical conservation issues as 
sustainable management rock stars sting and the grateful dead 
played benefit concerts for the cause media coverage increased 
some recent fruits of that effort 
brazil in october announced suspension of tax benefits for 
landowners who destroy the amazon rain forest the largest and 
fastestdisappearing on earth 
the international tropical timber organization approved a 4 
million project in northern brazil that calls for loggers to consult 
with environmental groups government agencies native indians and 
local workers to plan longterm forest development and preservation 
some 500 brazilian indians from 20 tribes gathered last month to 
oppose planned hydroelectric dams in the amazon that could flood 
rain forest areas including their homes the meeting was the first 
by the tribes which traditionally have battled over territory and 
remained isolated 
thailand imposed a nationwide logging ban after 
environmentalists blamed uncontrolled timber harvesting for floods 
that killed more than 350 people in november last april officials 
suspended plans for a hydroelectric dam that environmentalists said 
would have ruined thailands last virgin rain forest 
west germany earmarked about 80 million for saving tropical 
forests 
without a coherent strategy for protecting the tropical forests 
in which everyone concerned participates we cannot master the vast 
problems threatening the future of all mankind said west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
we have to be ambitious were in trouble said randall 
hayes head of the usbased rainforest action network if we 
dont get the changes we need in the next five years then weve 
lost the rain forests 
the results could be catastrophic 
rain forests cover some 24 billion acres of the planet about 
half the original amount ecologists say 
sometimes called the lungs of the earth they act as a 
pollution filter absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen if 
carbon dioxide isnt removed from the atmosphere it can trap heat 
which some scientists say causes a global warming trend called the 
greenhouse effect burning the rain forests a common way to create 
arable land also adds carbon to the atmosphere 
rain forests are storehouses of plant insect and animal species 
some of which could prove useful for drugs and other scientific 
endeavors scientists say only a small percentage of the 5 million 
species in the forests many of them unique to the tropical 
environment have been studied 
in addition 200 million people live in and around rain forests 
including indigenous tribes who depend on them for sustenance and 
shelter 
nonetheless preservation presents complexities that cut across 
social and political boundaries many rain forests are in developing 
countries that need to capitalize on their natural resources and 
must borrow money for costly modernization projects such as 
highways and power plants 
brazil for example has the developing worlds largest foreign 
debt at 115 billion two of its limited number of export products 
are beef and timber industries that cause major forest destruction 
cattle ranchers burn forests to create grazing land loggers clear 
jungle in search of exotic hardwoods 
meanwhile poor farmers burn small tracts to grow crops the 
soil so fertile under the rain forest canopy is then leached of 
nutrients in seasonal heavy rains forcing farmers to move on and 
burn another patch every few years 
last fall brazilian president jose sarney suspended tax benefits 
for land developers and banned exports of unprocessed tropical 
timber we must create nationwide consciousness that we are all 
passengers in the adventure of man on earth the era of unlimited 
natural resources is over he said 
but environmentalists contend the harmful practices continue 
now brazil is balking at proposals to swap some of its foreign debt 
for saving parcels of rain forest such plans would entail creation 
of an international commission to watch over the preserved jungle 
we cant turn the amazon into a sort of national park for 
humanity brazils foreign minister roberto de abreu sodre said 
our priority is economic development were open to international 
suggestions but not those that interfere in brazilian sovereignty 
industrial giants such as the united states and european 
countries which have little or no rain forest have been the most 
vocal about the developing nations efforts to halt the destruction 
that causes particular resentment 
a conference of eight nations in the amazon region including 
brazil earlier this month issued a declaration rejecting foreign 
interference while saying development must preserve the environment 
and wild resources 
part of the problem is that its coming down to the developed 
countries versus the developing countries said a us activist 
who monitors the world bank the largest source of aid to developing 
nations 
they developing countries say you raped your countries to 
get developed and now youre stopping us from doing it said the 
activist who spoke on condition his name not be used 
but nf potter canadas executive director at the 151nation 
world bank said there are ways of doing things without making 
the same mistakes 
the world bank has been criticized by environmentalists who say 
it ignores ecological issues when funding projects at issue are 
billions of dollars in the fiscal year ending june 30 the bank 
expects to loan a record 21 billion 
these bankers are unbelievably ignorant they are absolutely 
reckless said brent blackwelder of the usbased environmental 
policy institute 
under increasing pressure from member nations and environmental 
groups not to fund ecologically harmful projects the bank set up a 
department in 1987 to assess the potential damage of development 
projects 
you can see a lot more environmental consciousness than there 
was two years ago said an official with a us agency that 
monitors aid there has been movement im not saying there has 
been all the movement necessary

environmentalists also have accused some nations especially 
japan of funding projects with no regard for environmental issues 
for example the worldwide fund for nature formerly the world 
wildlife fund claims japan has helped finance hydroelectric dams in 
brazil that will flood rain forest so it can buy logs from the land 
to be flooded thus circumventing brazils ban on unprocessed 
timber exports 
motokatsu watanabe a japanese foreign ministry officer said 
japans private sector has not recognized the danger of 
deforestation a government goal was to increase public awareness 
he said 
world bank environmentalists say japan has improved its record 
recently by supporting research and increasing contributions to 
organizations 
in the asian and african forests logging has caused the most 
destruction environmentalists say that rather than selectively 
logging valuable woods for trade the timber industry destroys large 
tracts in search of exotic woods 
the wholescale logging leads to flooding from rainwater that runs 
over the barren land instead of being absorbed by foliage it also 
displaces native populations creating conflicts between developers 
and locals 
in malaysia members of the penans the last known tribe of 
nomadic hunters and gatherers on the north coast of borneo have 
repeatedly obstructed logging roads in sarawak state officials say 
more than 80 penans have been detained in recent months 
environmentalists put the figure at well above 100 
the penans began the campaign two years ago to protect hunting 
grounds they complain they are not recognized as owners of their 
ancestral lands 
the amazon indians who gathered in brazil have similar concerns 
while governments say they will offer programs to resettle the 
indians environmentalists call for sustainable management 
conservation efforts that yield rain forest resources while 
preserving the indian homelands they say such conservation is 
practiced in less than 1 percent of all rain forest 
an example of sustainable management is selective harvesting in 
which rows of trees are cut instead of whole sections of forest the 
forest can then regenerate under the remaining canopy 
such policies were the goal of francisco chico mendes an 
amazon ecologist mendes 44 was shot to death outside his home in 
december while under police protection from death threats four 
people have been arrested including members of a powerful ranching 
family that wanted to convert rain forest to grazing land

experts had warned for years that 
uncontrolled logging and clearing in asian rain forests could lead 
to disaster the warnings went unheeded until novembers rains 
brought floods and mudslides to thailand 
more than 350 people were killed including scores in the 
worsthit area nakhon sri thammarat as mud and felled trees rolled 
down hillsides and buried entire villages environmentalists blamed 
loggers who blamed farmers they said moved illegally into steep 
forests and burned away trees to plant crops 
the government in january banned logging on 384 million acres 
regardless of whos to blame government spoksman charnchai 
chairungrueng said thailands virgin forest has dwindled from 43 
percent of the nations land cover in 1972 to 27 percent 
environmentalists say its more like 20 percent 
about 25 percent of the worlds remaining tropical forests are in 
southeast asia 65 percent in indonesia the rest are spread among 
malaysia burma laos cambodia vietnam thailand and the 
philippines 
in 1982 an international meeting of conservation groups in bali 
heard that rain forest loss had caused floods in india and drought 
in indonesia clogged thailands traditional waterway support 
system devastated haitian farms and reduced efficiency of 
hydroelectric systems in the philippines 
measures to reduce deforestation are promised in indonesia the 
worlds largest supplier of tropical wood but the chainsaws cut as 
much as ever 
hasjrul harahap indonesias forestry minister said at least 
124 million acres are destroyed each year in his country only 
about 100000 acres a year are being reforested harahap blamed a 
lack of discipline among those holding forest concessions for 
the destruction most of the 544 concession holders are retired 
military officers or former government officials 
environmentalists say 133 million acres have been lost over 20 
years in addition to logging other factors are mining nomadic 
farmers and resettlement of millions of transmigrants from java 
to clear forests on other islands 
indonesia banned export of raw logs in 1985 to help the forests 
recover and force the manufacture of plywood and other finished 
products scores of plywood mills opened as expected creating badly 
needed jobs but increasing logging 
selective logging rules require that only trees of more than 20 
inches in diameter be cut but timber firms have logged over a wider 
area to find enough of the larger trees destroying many others in 
the process 
timber companies are supposed to pay into a reforestation fund 
for every tree felled but the forest conservation network of 
indonesia says there has never been a proper accounting of the fund 
malaysia the leading exporter of raw logs ships them from 
borneo islands sabah and sarawak states environmentalists say the 
timber harvesting rate in sabah is four times that of natural 
regeneration logging comprises 13 percent of the gross national 
product and malaysia exported 16 billion worth of logs and sawed 
wood in 1987 
malaysia also is sensitive to charges that logging in sarawak 
displaces the penans the last known tribe of nomadic hunters on 
borneos north coast the penans started blocking logging roads in 
april 1987 to protest the cutting of tropical hardwoods that provide 
a canopy for their highland hunting grounds 
penans claim they are not recognized as owners of their 
traditional lands which were handed down by earlier generations 
officials say 81 have been arrested this year environmentalists put 
the figure above 100 
kuala lumpur vigorously defends its logging policy and denounces 
critics protests last year at nine malaysian diplomatic missions 
were dismissed by foreign ministry secretarygeneral yusof hitam as 
attempts to sabotage the country for political reasons 
environmentalists accuse japan the worlds biggest consumer of 
tropical timber of wasting it on items like chopsticks that could 
be made from other timber or nontimber materials 
late last year japan began obtaining raw wood from brazilian 
forests the worldwide fund for nature said that would undercut 
trade with countries such as malaysia and indonesia forcing them to 
slash prices 
motokatsu watanabe a japanese foreign ministry officer said the 
private sector in japan has not recognized the danger of 
deforestation a major goal for the government he said is to 
increase public awareness 
the timber trade in the philippines has fallen and officials in 
manila blame runaway logging for shrinking forests the department 
of environmental and natural resources estimated only 3 million 
acres of virgin forests remained of the 404 million acres in the 
1940s

international pressure is mounting 
on brazil to preserve its fastdisappearing amazon rain forest but 
the debtridden south american nation continues to resist what it 
considers to be foreign meddling 
there is growing concern worldwide that destruction of the 2 
millionsquaremile rain forest the worlds largest and 
fastestdisappearing could change global weather with potentially 
disastrous consequences 
satellite photos of the amazon show that in the past 10 years an 
area the size of belgium has been slashed burned and mined away 
about 9 percent of the region is irreparably damaged said 
researcher philip m fearnside 
but ecologists charge that the government has done little to 
discourage uncontrolled destruction 
in january a us congressional delegation led by sen timothy 
wirth dcolo met with president jose sarney to discuss swapping 
part of brazils 115 billion debt for preserving amazon land 
france and the netherlands have made similar proposals involving 
creating an international commission to oversee the forest that 
covers twothirds of brazil and is home to 15 million people 
all received the same answer brazil wont be told what to do 
we cant turn the amazon into a sort of national park for 
humanity our priority is economic development were open to 
international suggestions but not those that interfere in brazilian 
sovereignty foreign minister roberto de abreu sodre said recently 
we cant be condemned to having a large part of our territory 
prevented from being developed particularly when the developed 
world is responsible for the worlds greatest ecological 
disasters said deputy foreign minister paulo tarso flecha de lima 
over the past two decades the government has given cattle 
ranchers tax breaks and other indirect subsidies totaling about 2 
billion even though studies show most of the amazon is unsuited to 
ranching or farming 
the tropical soil is extremely fragile when the protective 
forest canopy is burned nutrients wash away in the heavy rains 
a typical field wont stand more than two crops and a cattle 
pasture lasts not more than a decade said fearnside a professor 
at the amazonia research institute in manaus the principal amazon 
city only about 15 percent of the amazon soil is suitable for 
conventional farming 
in addition much of the land has been cleared and burned by 
farmers and by land speculators hoping for a better price for 
homesteaded property he said 
satellite photos of thousands of fires set by farmers and 
developers drew world attention last year as did the december 
slaying of internationally known ecologist francisco chico 
mendes 
the leader of a local rubber tappers union mendes fought to keep 
ranchers from cutting down the jungle for pasture he had called for 
more harvesting of amazon resources such as nuts latex and plants 
while preserving the trees 
four people including the son of a rancher have been arrested 
in a nation where 60 percent of the people survive on less than 
90 a month ecologists and politicians argue that the amazon has 
not created enough jobs to justify the destruction and its future 
consequences 
the idea that you tear down the rain forest to create jobs is 
not sound wirth said to send a lot of people out there to 
settle the amazon just doesnt work 
in the 1920s auto magnate henry ford failed in a scheme to 
cultivate rubber trees in a vast area now known as fordlandia 
decades later in the 1960s and 70s shipping magnate daniel ludwig 
lost a reported 1 billion in an ambitious plan to produce wood pulp 
and rice on the amazons jari river 
vast areas of the amazon have been devastated and the poverty 
is no less said artur virgilio mayor of manaus only the 
wealthy have so far benefited from the destruction 
foreign groups have said they would pressure international 
financial institutions not to release new funding for amazonrelated 
projects the world bank which has loaned brazil 15 billion since 
1949 for energyrelated and development projects is a principal 
target 
for example environmental groups have urged the world bank to 
reject a 500 million loan that would help brazil refinance some 
debt from construction of dams and power plants they say brazil 
would use some of the money for new projects instead of for 
balancing payments on other loans 
but this month brazil and the world bank announced a proposed 1 
billion loan for electric power development details of the proposed 
loan to be spread out over 18 months were not disclosed pending 
further negotiations

tropical rain forests are among the last ecosystems on earth 
virtually unchanged since prehistoric times and largely unexplored 
by modern man 
here are some facts 
rain forests cover about 24 billion acres mostly in south 
america africa and southeast asia environmentalists say about half 
the original rain forest has been destroyed and at the current pace 
it all will be gone or severely degraded within a century 
some 5 million species of plants animals and insects live in 
the rain forests many unique to the tropical environment with 
possible untold benefits to science agriculture and medicine 
scientists believe only a small percentage of these have been 
studied 
sometimes called the lungs of the earth rain forests act as 
a pollution filter by absorbing carbon dioxide from power plants 
automobiles and fires and producing oxygen in that way some 
scientists say they help reduce the socalled greenhouse effect a 
gradual warming of the earth because excess carbon dioxide and 
pollutants in the atmosphere trap the suns heat a major source of 
carbon in the atmosphere is from the widespread burning of rain 
forest a common method of clearing it for farming 
an estimated 200 million people live in and around rain forests 
including indigenous tribes that depend on the jungles for 
sustenance and shelter when displaced the natives become unskilled 
laborers in countries already struggling to develop socially and 
economically

eastern airlines pilots are caught in a catch 22 
the fliers could easily find jobs at other carriers thanks to a 
shortage of commercial pilots stemming from airline deregulation and 
explosive growth in passenger traffic many experts say 
but leaving strikebound eastern requires them to sacrifice 
seniority and accept lower pay and benefits 
for easterns management the pilot shortage could make it even 
more difficult to replace the 3600 pilots at the carrier experts 
said tuesday 
in order to attract new pilots eastern would have to offer 
competitive salaries and quick promotions and it would need lots 
of time to do so said peter cappelli a professor at the university 
of pennsylvanias wharton school and the university of california at 
berkeley who studies airline labor relations 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami declined to comment on 
the issue 
easterns pilots earn an average of 70000 to 85000 a year 
average pilot wages at healthy carriers such as united airlines and 
delta air lines are higher pilots pull in as much as 167000 at 
the highest seniority levels 
observers also say the rockbottom morale at eastern where 
employees anger toward boss frank lorenzo has reached fever pitch 
compounds the difficulty of luring replacement pilots the carrier 
which has been crippled by the machinists strike since march 4 
filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law 
thursday 
one airline industry executive who asked not to be identified 
admitted that the low morale at eastern and the support of pilots at 
other carriers for their colleagues at eastern and against lorenzo 
would make it tough to replace the rebellious fliers 
that solidarity was demonstrated tuesday when the executive 
board of the air line pilots association announced it had authorized 
strike benefit payments of 2400 a month plus interestfree loans 
for every eastern pilot honoring the machinists picket lines 
today there really is a shortage of pilots said mark kahn 
professor emeritus of economics at wayne state university in 
detroit airline deregulation and growth in demand plus a shrinking 
of the traditional source of pilots the military have 
contributed to this trend experts say 
kit darby executive vice president of future aviation 
professionals of america in atlanta calls the job market for pilots 
extremely good 
some airline executives say there is no pilot shortage 
i am not aware of any of my member carriers having trouble 
hiring qualified pilots said jerrold glass vice president of the 
airline industrial relations conference an airline trade 
association focused on labor relations 
if there actually is a nationwide pilot shortage it would be 
only a mixed blessing for easterns captains they have highly 
marketable skills but are hostages of the seniority system forced 
to start at the bottom of the ladder if they move to other airlines 
before the machinists strike eastern pilots were deserting the 
ailing carrier at the rate of about 500 a year according to alpa 
some of them had as many as 20 years seniority the pilots union 
says 
many of them went to work for healthier carriers such as american 
airlines northwest airlines usair piedmont united parcel service 
and federal express said daniel vician vice chairman of the master 
executive council of easterns alpa branch 
some of the more experienced pilots who left eastern saw their 
salaries cut from about 5833 a month to 1800 a month vician 
said 
i think were beginning to look at other jobs eastern pilot 
vince garland said recently as he walked a picket line at atlantas 
hartsfield international airport 
garland 40 whos flown for eastern for 10 years said hes 
been told he would have to take a 60 percent pay cut to move to a

japans matsushita electric industrial co ltd 
has named an american as secondincommand of its us operations 
but observers say it may be years before big japanese companies put 
an american in their top us post 
richard a kraft 60 was named tuesday as president and chief 
operating officer of matsushita electric corporation of america the 
us arm of the worlds biggest consumer electronics company 
kraft is a 15year veteran of the company which sells products 
under the panasonic technics and quasar brand names he has served 
as president of matsushita industrial co of franklin park ill 
matsushitas us manufacturing division since 1979 
kraft will run daytoday operations under akiya imura 54 who 
will continue as chief executive of the us company based in 
secaucus nj and assume the new title of chairman the changes 
take effect april 1 
american companies are much more likely than japanese companies 
to give their top jobs overseas to foreign nationals for example 
international business machines corp spokesman peter thonis said 
ibm does business in 130 foreign countries and has americans in 
charge at fewer than five of them 
in contrast the chairman of sony corp of america is masaaki 
morita younger brother of sony cofounder akio morita the us 
operations of fujitsu ltd hitachi ltd and the biggest japanese 
banks and brokerage houses all are headed by japanese as well 
when push comes to shove japanese and americans are not on the 
same promotion track said richard ozaroff an analyst who 
follows japanese companies for all the claims that they are 
multinational companies that just happen to be based in japan i 
dont buy it 
matsushita has been striving to achieve a reputation as a good 
corporate citizen in the united states by promoting americans and 
building us factories 
the companys image suffered a setback in january when its 
panasonic co unit agreed to pay consumers 16 million to avoid new 
york state charges that it fixed retail prices on electronics 
products 
while the company maintains its innocence some analysts said the 
unfavorable publicity may have added urgency to promoting an 
american to a top job as an imagebuilding move 
matsushita has more than 7000 employees in the united states 
scattered from hawaii to california illinois washington tennessee 
and new jersey it sells televisions videocassette recorders 
microwave ovens and other products it also sells business and 
industrial equipment 
kraft said that as an american he could be more effective than 
his predecessors in dealing with american employees government 
bodies and communities where matsushita has operations 
the american public today seems to be ambivalent about foreign 
companies in the united states kraft said by building 
matsushitas reputation he said we can ultimately overcome any 
possible friction and be welcome in this country 
matsushita which had 385 billion in sales last year has 102 
companies in 37 countries outside japan thirty of the companies in 
14 countries already were headed by nonjapanese and imura said 
picking an american to be president of the us operations had been 
a high priority for him in his twoyear stint as president 
kraft said he understands the japanese attitude of caution about 
promoting an american to the top job 
i think its only natural that the company would be 
conservative about turning over that kind of power until they had 
developed the confidence in the person enough to be comfortable 
he said 
could kraft ever get the top job in matsushitas us company 
this is america anything is possible it certainly could happen 
i would just be overjoyed if i could develop that kind of 
confidence he said whether it will happen in my lifetime or 
not i dont know 
kraft a chicago native holds 13 us patents as inventor or 
coinventor of electronics related to television

the strike against 
eastern airlines is costing the us virgin islands about 5 million 
a week and has cut short the heavy tourist season by nearly a month 
a hotel association spokesman said tuesday 
tom bennett spokesman for the st thomasst john hotel 
association said the loss of 35 eastern flights every week has 
translated into about 6200 fewer tourists per week 
the situation was aggravated when flyfare one of the largest 
travel agents dealing with the caribbean filed for bankruptcy 
flyfare dealt almost exclusively with eastern bennet said 
were certainly looking at a very serious time for the entire 
economy he said 
we are doing what we can to make it as easy as possible for 
eastern to come back in or to assist other existing carriers to 
increase their flights or to welcome a new carrier into the 
islands he added 
bennett also said negotiations were under way with the caribbean 
hotel association to fill the void left by flyfare 
while the hotel association and the virgin islands government 
were moving to increase flights with other carriers and to seek the 
aid of the caribbean hotel association losses through tuesday 
topped 5 million he said 
weve lost the lift of about 6000 people and according to 
statistics from the division of tourism that calculates to be a 
loss of 5 million a week bennett said 
the figure includes 500000 in various taxes lost to the local 
government which earns millions from the more than 600 million 
generated annually by 2 million visitors he said 
each week that this continues you are going to see that 
happening bennett said i think for all intents and purposes 
the tourist season has come to an abrupt halt 
in addition the 62 hotels and guest houses that are members of 
the association are reporting sharp drops in occupancy this month 
bennett said 
those hotels that were enjoying nearly full houses at the 
beginning of march are now looking at 60 and 70 percent occupancy 
the hotel association spokesman said 
in addition bennett said the impact is being felt among 
seasonal hotel employees who are working shorter hours and are 
being laid off a month ahead of schedule

consumers are contributing to slumping car and light truck sales 
which fell 148 percent in early march compared with the same period 
last year an analyst says 
the eight usbased vehicle manufacturers reported tuesday that 
vehicles sales averaged 33838 a day during the march 110 period 
compared with a daily rate of 36330 for the same time last year 
car sales took the largest hit dropping 185 percent while 
sales of light trucks fell 8 percent the companies said 
i look at consumer psychology and you have to believe that 
interest rates are beginning to dampen it said analyst mary anne 
sudol of fitch investors service inc of new york that has to cut 
into the familys disposable income and maybe theyre thinking maybe 
let the old buggy do longer i think consumers are very edgy 
the prime lending rate what banks charge their most 
creditworthy customers has risen 1 percentage point in the past 
month to 115 percent 
analysts and auto industry insiders expected the early march 
sales rate to be below that of last year when incentives were 
drawing consumers to showrooms like magnets incentives were offered 
during the period this year but havent had the draw of last year 
people have become jaded about them sudol said i hadnt 
looked for anything robust 
each of the big three automakers showed doubledigit declines in 
car sales during early march with chrysler corps figures dropping 
359 percent ford motor cos sales slumping 214 percent and 
general motors corps sales running 134 percent behind last years 
pace 
automakers will be closely watching the traditionally good early 
spring buying especially during the next two months 
its the classic warmup for the summer driving season sudol 
said everybody comes out of hibernation 
traditionally march and april sales have reduced automakers 
inventories which are hovering around the 80day level 
according to wards automotive reports the combined inventory 
among the usbased automakers is at its highest level in 19 months 
each of the big three recently boosted incentive offers in an 
effort to stoke the sales fire and gm temporarily halted production 
at two plants to reduce inventory 
for the year car and light truck sales by usbased makers were 
running 69 percent behind last years pace falling to a daily rate 
of 33838 vehicles so far this year from a rate of 36330 last year 
a 97 percent decline in car sales was offset by a 17 percent drop 
in truck sales 
chryslers car sales were down 214 percent on a yeartoyear 
comparison chryslers light trucks sales were 85 percent lower for 
the early march period and up 35 percent for the year 
for the year fords car sales were 33 percent lower than last 
years rate the nations no 2 vehicle maker said its truck sales 
were down 206 percent in early march compared with the same period 
last year and were off 35 percent for the year 
gms car sales for the year ran 144 percent behind last years 
pace light truck sales by gm were up 56 percent during the early

commuters have once again been spared the 
nightmare of a railroad workers walkout as a federal judge decided 
to continue his ban against honoring the picket lines of eastern 
airlines strikers 
but union leaders said they plan to appeal the court order 
possibly as soon as today 
i have little doubt that it will be appealed said sheldon 
engelhard attorney for the machinists union which struck eastern 
on march 4 
us district judge robert p patterson jr said there is a 
clear risk of immediate and irreparable injury to four area 
railroads and the riding public if railroad unions are allowed to 
strike in sympathy with eastern workers 
pattersons 34page opinion signed late monday and released 
tuesday morning will give the railroads the injunction they sought 
against sympathy strikes 
the judge noted that both sides agree all four rail lines the 
long island rail road metronorth commuter railroad new jersey 
transit rail operations and amtrak will have to shut down if their 
unionized workers honor eastern strikers picket lines 
in addition to the economic losses such sympathy strikes would 
cause the railroads the public over 400000 persons will suffer 
immediate and irreparable injury both in substantial inconvenience 
and in loss of pay by those unable to get to work patterson found 
he conceded that an injunction would deny the unions an 
opportunity to express union solidarity but he said the harm they 
would suffer is far less than that faced by the railroads and 
public in the event of a walkout 
patterson said his preliminary injunction to be issued later 
this week will prevent the rail workers unions from engaging in 
sympathy strikes slowdowns or other concerted labor activity in 
connection with any picketing of plaintiffs by striking eastern 
machinists 
in the meantime a temporary restraining order against sympathy 
strikes remains in place 
judge pattersons decision protects hundreds of thousands of 
rail commuters from becoming hostages in a labor dispute that is 
totally unrelated to the mta it would have been absurd for the 
customers of metronorth and the lirr to pay the price for a strike 
at eastern airlines said metropolitan transportation authority 
chairman robert kiley 
but william wintisinger president of the iam said in a 
statement issued by the union that pattersons ruling clearly 
oversteps his authority 
the statement continued when the judge stated that his 
decision was based on a clear risk of immediate irreparable injury 
to three area railroads and the public he made a decision that only 
the president of the united states is authorized to make 
the statement explained that under the railway labor act the 
president may appoint an emergency board and temporarily end the 
dispute for 60 days 
patterson issued a temporary restraining order march 5 barring 
workers at the lirr metronorth and nj transit from honoring 
eastern strikers picket lines amtrak workers were added to the 
order a day later 
patterson who has only been on the federal bench for about three 
months conducted two days of hearings at federal court in manhattan 
on the issue 
the unions claimed that federal labor law barred a federal judge 
from intervening in such a dispute 
patterson said he would require the rail unions to instruct their 
members to report for work because some unions have always 
honored picket lines without specific instructions from their 
leaders 
but james phelan general chairman of the united transportation 
unions metronorth local said my unions constitution talks 
about picket sites as being dangerous places and the utu intends to 
defend its members rights to avoid confrontations and other 
volatile situations such as picket lines 
we the utu did not encourage or endorse sympathetic action 
so that was not an issue for us phelan said 
if the machinists put up a picket line at metronorth phelan 
said he would encourage his members to run the other way

the us merchandise trade deficit shrank to 949 billion in 
january with the nation posting a rare trade surplus with western 
europe and the imbalance with japan declining to its lowest point in 
about four years the government reported today 
the commerce department attributed the 137 percent improvement 
in the overall shortfall the best showing since october to a 69 
percent drop in imports that was enough to offset a 43 percent 
decline in us export sales 
the monthly improvement was better than many analysts had been 
expecting although they cautioned against reading too much into a 
onemonth swing in the figures 
the 949 billion january deficit would translate into an annual 
imbalance of 114 billion compared with a deficit for all of 1988 
of 11976 billion 
stock and bond prices were slightly higher today after the 
report the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 554 at 
231179 after an hour of trading 
separately the commerce department said business inventories 
rose 07 percent in january while sales advanced at a strong 1 
percent pace the report indicated steady economic growth 
the commerce department reported tuesday that retail sales 
dropped 04 percent in february the decline was sparked by a sharp 
drop in sales at car dealerships which account for almost 25 
percent of total retail sales 
the nations automakers had more bad news sales continued to 
drop in the first 10 days of march analysts speculated the 148 
percent drop in car and light truck sales from the same period last 
year was due in part to rising interest rates 
chrysler corp said its sales dropped 359 percent in early 
march while ford motor co reported a 214 percent decline and 
general motors corp said its sales slipped 134 percent 
economist john hagens of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
economic forecasting service said that while the economy entered 
1989 with strong momentum consumers may be cautious in anticipation 
of slower economic growth or recession 
a slowing of consumer spending is consistent with the 
expectation of a recession hagens said consumers are typically 
very smart they know these things often before economists 
however a drop in consumer spending could by itself cause an 
economic slowdown consumer spending accounts for twothirds of the 
gross national product 
the falloff in sales was welcome news to many financial markets 
which have been concerned that the economy is growing too fast to 
avoid a flareup of inflation the federal reserve has been driving 
interest rates higher to try to restrain inflation 
stock prices rallied in early trading in response to the commerce 
department report but ended the day little changed as investors 
looked forward to todays release of january trade deficit figures 
the dow jones industrial average ended the day at the same level 
where it closed on monday 230625 
on the bond market the price of the treasurys closelywatched 
30year issue rose 5 for every 1000 in face amount as investors 
fears of inflation were calmed by the retail sales report 
however the dollar fell in response to the sales report because 
of the prospect of lower interest rates lower interest rates make 
the dollar less attractive to foreign investors 
while the markets were anticipating the january trade figures 
they got a report on the 1988 deficit on tuesday the commerce 
department said the broadest measure of american trade the current 
account improved dramatically last year narrowing to 1353 
billion from a recordhigh 15396 billion in 1987 
a surge in merchandise exports offset a sharp worsening in the 
us investment balance sheet the government said 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only 
trade in merchandise but also transactions in investments and other 
services

chiles booming fruit export industry was 
paralyzed today as growers and sellers halted all shipments and 
began scouring their stocks in response to a worldwide cyanide 
contamination scare 
the military government harshly criticized the us ban on 
chilean fruit imports as another roguish act of the united 
states but promised to check all fruit before it leaves the 
country 
the independent democratic union a supporter of the military 
regime announced a national day of fruit eating for thursday 
joaquin lavin party vice president said the group is asking 
chileans to show the world that our fruits are healthy and of 
superior quality 
exporters and growers said tuesday night they had voluntarily 
halted packing and shipping for 72 hours to check inventories 
chiles exporters association said all fruit should be submitted 
to government inspection and none would be exported until it 
receives approval from health officials 
scores of trucks loaded with fruit were reported idle tuesday 
night in valparaiso chiles principal port city at many vineyards 
grape pickers were sent back home 
the us food and drug administration on monday announced that 
traces of cyanide had been found in two seedless red grapes from 
chile that were in a batch at the port in philadelphia 
the discovery came during spot checks by federal officials after 
the us and japanese embassies in santiago received anonymous 
telephone calls earlier this month saying fruit exports would be 
poisoned 
health officials in the united states canada and japan warned 
consumers not to eat chilean fruit and stores began removing from 
shelves fruit imported from chile 
the 12nation european economic community today said it has 
received no reports of contamination of chilean fruit a spokesman 
for the trade bloc speaking on condition of anonymity said the eec 
asked its members if they had any evidence of any such contamination 
dansk supermarked denmarks secondlargest supermarket chain 
has removed chilean fruit from its shelves as a precaution 
president augusto pinochet sent his ministers of foreign affairs 
hernan errazuriz and agriculture jaime de la sotta to washington 
to discuss the crisis with us officials 
in hong kong health inspectors on tuesday seized nearly 67 tons 
of chilean seedless red grapes from importers and wholesalers for 
testing the government said health inspectors had contacted local 
importers to stop sales of the chilean grapes 
chileans reacted strongly to what they saw as a major blow to 
their skyrocketing fruit export industry which was expected to earn 
about 850 million this year up from 581 million in 1988 
nearly 65 percent of chiles fruit exports grapes melons 
apples and peaches go to the united states 
the fruit industry now employs around 500000 people and union 
leaders reported scattered layoffs on tuesday 
the government said the poisoning of the grapes was the work of 
terrorism backed by the communist party 
jose sanfuentes a spokesman for the communists denied his party 
was in any way involved speaking at a news conference he 
criticized the government for faulty controls of exported fruits 
many chileans said the us reaction was exaggerated 
i dont think an anonymous phone call and two grapes may be 
allowed to endanger the entire world trade it may even be a testing 
error de la sotta said 
chile is at the height of the harvesting season and de la sotta 
said it expected to export about 103 million crates of fruit he 
said about 47 million crates had been shipped and another 17 million 
were in warehouses awaiting shipment or en route to various 
countries 
adm jose merino navy commander and a member of the ruling 
military junta blamed both the communists and the united states 
this is yet another roguish act of the united states he told 
reporters americans think we are all banana republics chile is 
not a banana republic 
he said chile should find alternative markets for its fruit and 
forget the united states

quick agreement between congressional and 
administration budget negotiators is unlikely and congress may miss 
its april 15 deadline for drafting a spending plan house majority 
leader thomas s foley said today 
i do not expect this to move very fast foley dwash said 
as the closeddoor talks resumed on capitol hill it has to move 
over a period of time its a gradual process 
foley said he did not expect agreement by march 23 when the 
negotiating group is scheduled to report back to president bush and 
the house and senate leadership i think the 23rd is very early 
he said 
what we would like to do is meet the april 15 date for a budget 
resolution he said but that often has not been possible and 
a may 15 completion of a fiscal 1990 budget might be more realistic 
he said 
bush and congressional leaders agreed at a white house meeting 
tuesday that the talks would aim to develop a consensus on broad 
generalities instead of specific programs in hopes of finding 
progress before the end of next week 
i believe it is a historic step said sen pete v domenici 
rnm the senior republican on the budget committee who gave the 
most bubbly assessment following the meeting i look forward to 
the beginning of earnest negotiations he said 
the democratic chairman of the senate budget committee jim 
sasser dtenn was upbeat but less sanguine 
i think weve got at least a 5050 chance at this juncture of a 
successful negotiation said sasser i dont want to overstate 
the chances of success however 
white house aides have been meeting steadily with congressional 
budget writers since bush on feb 9 released his 116 trillion 
spending plan for fiscal 1990 however the discussions have dwelled 
on the scope and format of their mission as neither side has been 
willing to propose either new taxes or new spending cuts to reduce 
the deficit 
at bushs invitation the budget negotiators key committee 
chairmen and the party leaders of the house and senate met tuesday 
at the white house to see if the talks could be moved forward 
they agreed the talks would aim for an overall balance between 
entitlements other domestic programs military spending and foreign 
aid and the amount of new government revenue that would be raised 
they would produce overall numbers but not decide on the policies 
needed to implement them 
we budget negotiators have in thepast devoted way too much 
time concerning ourselves with the details of programs said 
domenici the details were rightly left to the house and senate 
committees with jurisdiction over the specific programs he said 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said that 
while the product would be only broad numbers the discussions would 
of necessity touch on many specifics and the going could be tough 
in order to reach these we have got to have policy discussions 
about whats doable he said 
domenici said the talks would also focus first on only fiscal 
1990 after that he said negotiators might see if there was a 
chance for a twoyear pact 
for fiscal 1990 the grammrudman law calls for reducing the 
deficit to 100 billion both democrats and republicans agree that 
goal can be met without a tax increase 
however many democrats contend the fiscal 1991 target of 64 
billion cant reached without new taxes something bush has 
continuously said he would oppose 
the current talks involve bushs budget director richard darman 
and the chairman and senior republicans of the house and senate 
budget committees the group has said it hopes to reach some 
consensus by march 23 when the house begins its easter reess 
with the talks moving slowly the democraticcontrolled congress 
has begun moving ahead with its own budget process 
the senate budget committee plans to begin public drafting of a 
spending plan on friday and the house budget committee staff is 
putting together a package for that panel to consider following the 
easter recess

publisher robert maxwell said wednesday his new 
newspaper the european originally scheduled to be launched in may 
as a daily will begin publishing this autumn as a weekly 
maxwell told the foreign press association that the european 
would initially be a weekend paper 
the owner of mirror group newspapers said research has convinced 
him the paper should begin as a weekly to establish a base from 
which daily publication could begin 
maxwell said differences between the french and british 
executives of the european were part of the reason for postponing 
its launch 
i could hardly launch a newspaper dedicated to the concept of 
european unity with a warring crew he said 
i think i can now see my way toward preserving the peace or if 
not ensuring that any hostility which remains is constructive he 
said 
maxwell said the european printed mostly in english would 
be published on fridays to create a firm footing in a new market 
from which we can later begin a daily publication 
our purpose is to inform enlighten entertain and propagate 
the ideals of a europe united from the atlantic to the urals 
maxwell said 
the weekly edition will be more able to analyze and report the 
issues which affect the daily lives of the people of europe as well 
as their interests in the arts sport fashion and humor savings 
finance politics science medicine and agriculture 
we will be a good and exciting newspaper and a must for all 
those who recognize that europe is our only true future he said

the new york stock exchange said wednesday its 
profit fell 694 percent last year because of a decline in trading 
from the record level of 1987 
the big board said it earned 104 million down from 341 
million as revenue from the nyse and its subsidiaries fell 74 
percent to 3235 million from a record 3494 million in 1987 
trading volume of 408 billion shares was the second highest ever 
but down 145 percent from the record of 478 billion shares a year 
earlier trading in 1987 was swollen by the bull market that 
prevailed for most of the year and then by the crash that occurred 
in october 
average daily trading volume fell to 1615 million shares in 1988 
from 1889 million in 1987 the exchange said 
the decline in trading was partially offset by increased revenue 
from new listings a record 155 companies joined the nyse last year 
it said 
the exchange a notforprofit company gets most of its revenue 
from fees charged to companies for being listed on the exchange and 
fees on daily trades it reports its earnings annually

the us merchandise trade deficit narrowed to 
949 billion in january as the nation posted a rare trade surplus 
with western europe and the imbalance with japan declined to its 
lowest point in 2 years the government reported today 
the commerce department said the sharp 137 percent improvement 
in the overall trade deficit the best showing since october 
reflected a 69 percent drop in imports that was enough to offset a 
43 percent decline in us export sales 
while the trade improvement was hailed by the bush 
administration many private analysts said the figures did not 
change their view that americas trading performance would most 
likely weaken in 1989 as the us boom in export sales slows and 
americas oil bill increases because of higher world oil prices 
the 949 billion january deficit would translate into an annual 
imbalance of 114 billion compared with a deficit for all of 1988 
of 11976 billion 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
expected this years deficit to rise to around 130 billion 
reflecting in large part the fact that world oil prices have not hit 
18 per barrel up from lows approaching 12 per barrel last year 
that is a huge increase in the price of oil and will likely add 
1 billion to our oil bill each month evans said when you 
combine that with the fact that our export boom has run out of 
steam the january report is going to be the last reduction we get 
in our trade deficit for quite some time 
but the bush administrations top trade officials commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher and us trade representative carla 
hills called the january improvement an encouraging sign that the 
deficit is continuing to decline 
the year is starting on a plus note mosbacher said in his 
statement our aim should be to build on this improvement in the 
months ahead and i will do all in my power to encourage businesses 
large and small to sell us products abroad 
the january deficit reflected a rare surplus of 465 million 
with western europe the first trade surplus there since september 
1983 
the trade deficit with japan dropped to 35 billion while this 
was as usual the highest imbalance the united states had with any 
country it was the lowest deficit with japan since june 1986 when 
it was 337 billion the commerce department had originally said 
the deficit with japan was the lowest since february 1985 but after 
further checking corrected that statement 
the 949 billion january trade imbalance followed a 1099 
billion deficit in december and was the smallest imbalance since 
878 billion in october 
starting with the january report the government is removing the 
cost of shipping and insurance from the import totals a bookkeeping 
change that has the effect of lowering each months trade deficit by 
about 15 billion the adjustments were also made to the prior 
months data to conform with the new reporting system 
with shipping and insurance charges included the 1988 
merchandise trade deficit was 1373 billion and with those costs 
removed the deficit totaled 11976 billion 
the january performance reflected a 69 percent decline in 
imports which fell to a seasonally adjusted 3729 billion 
the smaller import figure reflected declines in sales of foreign 
consumer goods down 14 billion and a drop in sales of foreign 
cars down 700 million 
us imports of oil were up sharply in january rising 61 
percent to 35 billion reflecting higher petroleum prices the 
price per barrel jumped to 1446 from 1310 in december while the 
number of barrels fell to 78 million barrels per day from 811 
million barrels in december 
us export sales fell 43 percent to 278 billion down from a 
record 2906 billion in december 
the drop reflected declines in sales of capital goods down 12 
billion and industrial supplies which fell 600 million 
the measurement change removing the costs of shipping and 
insurance adopted by congress at the urging of the reagan 
administration will return the government to the trade accounting 
procedures used before 1979 
starting in that year the government included the costs paid to 
foreigners to ship and insure their products as part of the 
countrys total import bill former sen russell long dla 
sponsored an amendment making the change 
however reagan administration officials argued that the shipping 
costs were actually payments for services and should be included in 
the services category of the current account trade report which 
breaks us trade down into trade in merchandise and trade in 
services 
the government released data on tuesday showing that the current 
account deficit for 1988 totaled 1353 billion a 121 percent 
improvement from the alltime high of 15396 billion set in 1987

the us merchandise trade deficit narrowed 
sharply in january to 949 billion the lowest imbalance in three 
months as a big decline in consumer imports offset a higher oil 
bill the government reported wednesday 
the commerce department said that the imbalance between imports 
and exports fell by 137 percent from a revised december deficit of 
1099 billion as the united states posted a rare trade surplus with 
europe and the deficit with japan fell to its lowest point in 2 
years 
the bush administration hailed the development as an encouraging 
sign of progress in whittling down the countrys huge trade deficit 
but many private economists were far less encouraged 
some analysts called the january figure a onemonth fluke in what 
they believe will be an otherwise dreary outlook for us trade 
prospects this year 
in 1988 the us trade deficit declined by 21 percent to 11976 
billion as a boom in export sales helped provide twofifths of the 
years total economic growth 
but analysts are forecasting that export sales despite 
aggressive marketopening efforts on the part of the administration 
will slow significantly in 1989 while americas foreign oil bill 
increases reflecting rising world oil prices 
the january report is going to be the last reduction we get in 
our trade deficit for quite some time said michael evans head of 
a washington forecating firm our export boom ran out of steam 
some time ago and now we are seeing the effect of higher oil 
prices 
evans predicted that the us trade deficit would actually 
increase to 130 billion this year based on the adverse trends 
that would be a blow to the administration which is counting on 
exportled growth to help keep the us economy moving forward at a 
rapid clip bringing in the government revenues needed to lower the 
federal budget deficit 
both commerce secretary robert mosbacher and us trade 
representative carla hills the administrations top trade 
officials issued statements hailing the january decline as an 
encouraging development 
the year is starting on a plus note mosbacher said our 
aim should be to build on this improvement in the months ahead 
the administration has adopted a tough trade stance pledging to 
work aggressively to open foreign markets to more us products but 
many private economists expressed doubt that there is much room left 
for american exports to grow given the 27 percent jump in export 
sales which occurred last year 
we have to get a decline in imports for us to mount another 
significant improvement in our trade deficit said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co sinai said any lasting drop in 
imports was unlikely until there is a significant slowdown in the 
us economy 
the january deficit reflected a surplus of 465 million with 
western europe the first trade surplus there since september 1983 
primarily reflecting higher us sales in britain and france 
the trade deficit with japan dropped to 35 billion with 
twofifths of that decline reflecting a drop in japanese car 
imports the japanese deficit as usual the largest of any country 
fell to its lowest point since a 337 billion imbalance in june 
1986 
william t archey the top trade expert with the us chamber of 
commerce said it remained to be seen whether this decline was just 
a blip in the monthly statistics or reflected the fact that more 
japanese cars are being manufactured at plants in the united states 
starting with the january report the government is removing the 
cost of shipping and insurance from the import totals a bookkeeping 
change that has the effect of lowering each months trade deficit by 
about 15 billion the adjustments were also made to the prior 
months data to conform with the new reporting system 
with shipping and insurance charges included the 1988 
merchandise trade deficit was 1373 billion the measurement change 
removing the costs of shipping and insurance adopted by congress at 
the urging of the reagan administration will return the government 
to the trade accounting procedures used before 1979 
the january deficit of 949 billion reflected declines in both 
imports and exports which had hit alltime record levels in 
december 
us imports fell by 69 percent to 3729 billion as sales of 
foreign consumer goods declined by 14 billion and foreign car 
shipments declined by 700 million 
us imports of oil however were up sharply in january rising 
61 percent to 35 billion reflecting rising prices the price per 
barrel jumped to 1446 from 1310 in december while the number of 
barrels fell to 78 million barrels per day from 811 million 
barrels in december 
analysts said with world oil prices already at 18 per barrel 
americas oil bill would be rising even higher in the future 
us export sales fell 43 percent to 278 billion down from a 
record 2906 billion in december the drop reflected declines in 
sales of capital goods down 12 billion and industrial supplies 
which fell 600 million

living on welfare while dying of aids ron found grim 
satisfaction that his death would enrich the beneficiary of his 
35000 life insurance policy 
now under an experiment by the canadian subsidiary of prudential 
insurance co the 44yearold ontario man has received 25000 of 
his own death benefits to make his last days more livable 
having the money being able to pay my share of expenses 
really helped bring back part of my selfesteem said ron who 
spoke on condition that his real name not be used 
he is one of only five people to receive living benefits 
under a program that has paid out less than 100000 prudential 
officials and insurance industry experts believe it could be the 
precursor to a future where the terminally ill can tap into life 
insurance benefits to help with medical and living costs 
we are working here in the united states on the possibility of 
offering living benefits for hospice and nursing home care and organ 
transplants said joseph vecchione prudentials vice president 
for public relations we realize that such efforts could serve 
important social purposes 
the canadian experiment was the creation of ron barbaro 
president for prudentials canadian operations barbaro a 
fundraiser for a toronto aids hospice learned that aids victims 
are often thrown into poverty left with few resources and little 
dignity 
i asked why we couldnt forget the rule that you needed a death 
certificate in order to pay benefits he said i thought we 
should look to the other side of the ledger and do something for 
customers who are suffering terrible indignities 
encouraged by his parent company barbaro sought out terminally 
ill policy holders prudential medical officials contacted the 
policy holders doctors beginning last summer and negotiations were 
begun 
the beneficiaries have been more than cooperative said glenn 
daniels assistant general counsel for prudentials canadian branch 
under the agreements money is given to the policy holder as a 
loan against the balance of the death benefits in rons case he 
received 25000 of the 35000 policy his beneficiary a friend 
readily agreed 
when the policy holder dies prudential figures the amount of 
interest it would have earned on the money already paid out and 
deducts that sum from the remainder of the death benefits 
daniels said that allows the policy holder to get the money early 
without costing the insurance company lost interest on the sum 
nobody loses he said 
for ron who lost his 56000ayear job because of his illness 
the money eased the stress of filing for bankruptcy and living on 
welfare for most of the six years hes been diagnosed with aids 
the first thing i did with the money was to go out and have a 
very good meal he said 
he moved to a larger apartment bought new clothes a stereo and 
a washer and dryer which allowed him to do his own laundry for the 
first time in months his illness had left him too weak to carry his 
clothes to the laundromat 
it gave me back a sense of independence and selfesteem he 
said 
ron also used part of the money to travel 1200 miles for a 
reunion and reconciliation with his family 
it all meant a great deal to me he said i think its the 
most compassionate innovative piece of management ive come across 
in years 
while the pilot program isnt solely for aids patients 
barbaros unit is now helping a policy holder with an inoperable 
brain tumor aids advocates hail the prudential program as an 
important step 
the insurance industry as a whole has had a businessasusual 
approach to aids and has done very little to come up with new 
approaches said ben schatz director of the national gay rights 
advocates aids civil rights project and a member of the aids 
advisory committee of the national association of insurance 
commissioners 
still it may be a long time before us insurers adopt similar 
plans 
we are serious about the program but we dont know what well 
encounter when we get to the regulatory route prudentials 
vecchione said noting that every state has its own insurance 
industry regulations 
he pointed to another potential problem the proceeds of a life 
insurance policy to a beneficiary are tax free we dont know 
whether that would apply in this case 
although a handful of us insurance companies offer special 
policies that provide payment before death john booth vice 
president and chief actuary of the american council of life 
insurance said insurance companies may be leery of adapting such a 
program on a large scale 
one reason is the cost of negotiating each claim could become 
astronomical if it became available to the hundreds of thousands of 
people diagnosed each year with a terminal disease in 1987 the us 
insurance industry paid 20 billion in death benefits 
booth also said there are fears that such a program would 
encourage those with terminal illnesses to try to buy life insurance 
despite the problems barbaro believes his program will 
eventually be adopted by us insurers i think its inevitable 
based on the simplicity of the idea

shamrock holdings inc claimed wednesday that 
polaroid incs tender offer for 16 million of its shares is 
misleading under securities and exchange commission rules but 
polaroid called the complaint a delay tactic 
in us district court in wilmington del judge caleb wright 
heard arguments from lawyers representing the two companies which 
have been embroiled in a hostile takeover battle for months wright 
reserved judgment on the matter until later this week 
shamrock representatives said the selftender offer at 50 a 
share and expiring march 20 is misleading because polaroid hasnt 
released a full and fair disclosure of its pertinent information 
such as records of the companys settlement with kodak over instant 
photography technology but polaroid said shamrock wants to delay 
the closing and gain a tactical advantage by buying all the 
available shares for 45 each 
what shamrock wants desperately here is delay said polaroid 
attorney robert s rifkind 
polaroids stock repurchase offer is subject to various 
conditions including definitive financing an absence of adverse 
decisions in lawsuits with shamrock and changes in shamrocks 
hostile bid 
polaroid has been resisting shamrocks hostile takeover bid since 
july when the burbank calif company made a friendly but 
unsolicited offer of 40 a share in january it upped the bid to 
45 
polaroid last july put 97 million shares into an employee stock 
ownership plan in january the company announced a recapitalization 
plan that included selling 300 million of stock to corporate 
partners lp a private investment group 
shamrock a television and radio concern owned by the roy e 
disney family owns about 48 million shares of polaroid and is 
waging a proxy fight for control of the board of directors at the 
may 9 annual meeting in addition to its hostile tender offer 
the companies are also expecting a decision this week from a 
lower delaware court on whether a judge will combine her decision on 
polaroids employee stock ownership plan with a new request for a 
preliminary injunction by shamrock against polaroids agreement with 
corporate partners

ross will receive a salary of 800000 a year and a share of the 
profits in the merged company time warner inc the arrangement is 
roughly equivalent to compensation ross receives at warner the 
company said 
other top warner executives could receive as much as 15 million 
each by exercising their rights under warner stocks option plan 
warner said the plan allows the executives to cash in their 
holdings in the event of a merger 
at time chairman j richard munro and president nj nicholas 
jr will not receive large cash payouts as a result of the merger 
that will create the worlds largest media concern however they 
stand to draw large salaries under their compensation agreements 
with the new company 
munro who will serve as cochairman of warner with ross for the 
next two years will receive at least 146 million in annual salary 
and bonuses time spokesman louis slovinsky said 
if munro retires before may 1990 he will receive nearly 428 
million in deferred compensation and still be paid 750000 a year 
as chairman of the executive committee slovinsky said 
the terms are similar to those munro would have at time without a 
merger but provide for increases depending on how well time warner 
performs 
nicholas who will succeed munro and is expected to become time 
warners sole chief executive after five years will be paid at 
least 13 million annually however the company said stock options 
expected to be granted to nicholas and other time executives could 
sharply increase his compensation 
warner communications has a larger compensation structure than 
time does the wall street journal quoted sources as saying time 
warner likely will bring time managers in line with their warner 
counterparts after the merger is completed 
the merger which will be accomplished through a stock swap will 
create a company with projected annual revenue of 10 billion

stock prices rose today after the governments 
report of a slightly smallerthanexpected us trade deficit for 
january 
the commerce department reported that the nations trade deficit 
narrowed to 949 billion in january from a revised 1099 billion 
the month before 
the data which were formerly reported in two ways are now

the latest figure came in below most wall street economists 
estimates prompting some buying by traders 
michael metz a market analyst with oppenheimer amp co said 
traders were pleased by declines in us imports and exports which

futures industry leaders gathered 
wednesday for their annual fourday meeting amid speculation that 
federal authorities in chicago were preparing to charge six people 
in connection with an investigation of trading fraud in the 
commodities pits 
anton valukas the us attorney in chicago would not comment on 
the rumors which have been spreading among defense attorneys 
meanwhile some congressmen who usually attend the futures 
industry associations annual meeting at the industrys expense 
reportedly have made other plans this year apparently wanting to 
avoid appearing to be too close to the industry 
the governments wideranging undercover investigation of 
commodity futures trading at the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange has yielded no charges since it was 
disclosed on jan 19 
the probe is believed to focus on as many as 100 traders and on 
allegations that they systematically cheated customers out of 
millions of dollars while executing their orders on the trading 
floors of the worlds two largest futures exchanges 
futures are contracts to buy and sell commodities and financial 
instruments at a specified price on a future date 
some lawyers representing traders and firms targeted by the 
investigation said they believed valukas was preparing to charge 
about half a dozen people in the near future 
they did not dismiss the possibility that charges may be 
announced in chicago while many futuresindustry leaders exchange 
officials brokerage executives and commodities lawyers are 
gathered in boca raton 
it would be kind of true to form said chicago attorney 
gerald fishman who recalled that the chicago tribune broke the 
first story of the investigation while many of the top commodities 
lawyers were at an american bar association meeting at a caribbean 
resort 
it might have some timely impact to do it while everyones 
gathered together said jeffrey cole another chicagobased 
commodities lawyer 
about 1100 people are attending the futures industry association 
meeting at the posh boca raton resort and club where panel 
discussions were scheduled on such topics as regulation customer 
protection and congressional reauthorization of the commodity 
futures trading commission the federal agency that oversees futures 
trading 
reauthorization of the cftc which begins with the house and 
senate agriculture committees has been delayed by concerns raised 
by the chicago investigation 
about 20 members of congress are expected to attend the meeting 
the chicago tribune reported on wednesday that some have will not 
have their expenses paid by the trade group or by futures exchanges 
and will not accept speaking fees 
house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza 
dtexas who usually attends the meeting decided not to go after 
reports of the investigation surfaced the tribune reported citing 
an unnamed source it said was close to the committee 
rep glenn english dokla who is heading the house panels 
investigation into alleged trading abuses will travel to florida at 
the committees expense and wont accept a speaking fee for his 
appearance at a luncheon thursday the tribune reported quoting an 
unidentified aide 
futures industry association president john damgard said some 
congressmen may want to avoid any semblance of being too close to 
the industry in light of the federal probe and the cftc hearings

two companies who offered more than 18 
million were the highest bidders for federal oil and gas leases sold 
wednesday in the central gulf of mexico 
fmp operating co and northwestern mutual life insurance co 
entered the joint bid on a 5000acre block in the heavily explored 
west delta region south of plaquemines parish la 
bids were received on 29 million acres of the 321 million acres 
offered for lease by the interior department high bids totaled 
3975 million according to j rogers pearcy regional director of 
interiors mineral management service 
it was comparable to last years sale we didnt have quite as 
much deepwater bidding this time said pearcy 
in a 1983 lease sale pearcy said the government leased 14 
billion worth of deepwater tracts for a fiveyear term 
leaseholders relinquished or let expire 303 of those leases but 
127 of them were resold wednesday pearcy said 
the interest in these previously leased tracts indicates that 
the central gulf continues to capture the attention of the oil and 
gas industry as a promising province said robert kallman 
director of mms 
throughout the history of oil and gas exploration in the gulf 
many of the larger discoveries have come from tracts which had been 
previously leased said kallman 
last year 931 bids were received on 684 tracts this year 821 
bids were received on 591 tracts one tract got seven bids but many 
attracted only one bidder 
more small companies participated this year in the annual lease 
sale said an mms spokeswoman 
were seeing a number of small and new companies that have not 
participated before said eileen angelico 
angelico said 117 companies qualified to bid this year compared 
to 112 last year 81 actually bid compared to 84 in 1987 she said

the copyright office on wednesday urged 
congress to consider protecting future films from colorization but 
said it would probably be unconstitutional to extend such protection 
to existing movies 
the office said it would prefer legislation that would also 
protect visual artists such as sculptors and painters by giving 
them moral rights to bar unauthorized alteration of their works 
but it said it could support legislation applying to film makers 
alone in addition to protecting against colorization the office 
also recommended protecting film makers from technical processes 
that speed up or slow down movies to fit the time frames of 
television or which alter the shape of the image to fit the 
television screen 
since most movies are now made in color the furor about 
colorization has been largely over application of the process to 
films including some hollywood classics made in the heyday of 
blackandwhite production in the 1930s through the 1950s 
the copyright office which is an arm of the library of congress 
recommended in its report that an industrywide committee be formed 
to draft guidelines governing colorization of such works 
the patent and trademark office in a report released at the same 
time recommended that no changes in the trademark law should be 
made but left the door open to changes in copyright law 
both reports were requested by the house judiciary committees 
subcommittee on copyright which held hearings on the issue last 
year and concluded that no legislation was needed 
the copyright offices report drew lukewarm reaction from the 
subcommittee chairman and a reproof from the industry for getting 
involved in the dispute 
rep robert kastenmeier dwis subcommittee chairman promised 
to review both reports carefully but added we must ask the 
proponents of change to bear the burden of proving that the change 
is necessary fair and practical second we must always recognize 
and balance the rights of creators producers or copyright holders 
and the public interest third a private solution negotiated by 
interested parties is always preferable to congressional 
intervention 
the committee for americas copyright community representing the 
publishing broadcasting recording and movie industries said we 
are disappointed by the overall tone of the summary 
we are deeply troubled by an agency of the government making 
aesthetic judgments about the quality of creative works the 
committee said these decisions belong to the public 
ted turners turner broadcasting system which has bought mgm and 
colorized such old movies as casablanca and the maltese 
falcon issued a statement in support of the copyright offices 
recommendation against applying colorization restrictions to 
existing movies 
but bert carp a tbs spokesman said the company disagrees with 
the recommendation that congress consider a system of moral 
rights which would confer new statutory rights on artists 
in our view congress should not redefine the legal 
relationships among the members of our motion picture community to 
mimic those of countries which have had much less success carp 
said 
ralph oman the register of copyrights urged the subcommittee to 
consider before anything else a unified package of legislation 
covering not only film makers but also other visual artists giving 
them moral rights to bar alteration of their work 
but oman said the copyright office could support a decision to 
enact artists rights legislation to film makers alone if the 
subcommittee chooses this approach the office said it should 
carefully consider whether the existing web of collective and 
individual bargaining is adequate to protect directors legitimate 
interests 
the office assumes that any additional moral rights granted 
would be prospective only and would not affect existing works 
oman said we have concluded that even if congress wanted to stop 
the colorization of existing blackandwhite pictures with new moral 
rights legislation the fifth amendment would probably stand in the 
way the court would probably see it as a taking without due process 
of law 
the fifth amendment prevents the taking of private property 
without due process formal legal action without adequate 
compensation 
oman urged congress to encourage the parties to establish a 
voluntary industrywide steering committee outside of the 
collective bargaining area to pinpoint those alterations that give 
some people heartburn and try to reach industrywide voluntary 
guidelines for existing works 
kastenmaier said his subcommittee had decided no legislation was 
needed because existing law was sufficient for the united states to 
join the berne convention on copyright which provides for moral 
rights protection 
however rep bob mrazek dny said the copyright office 
report makes it clear that current us law doesnt meet the 
standards of the conventions moralrights provision 
in a companion report requested by the subcommittee donald j 
quigg commissioner of patents and trademarks said no change should 
be made in the trademark law because of the colorization issue 
we take no position at this time on the desirability of more 
extensive moral rights protection for american creative artists 
under the copyright law quigg said

commerce secretary robert mosbacher on 
wednesday said japan must do more to open its markets to us 
hightechnology computer products contending that it has failed to 
live up to a 1986 commitment involving semiconductor sales 
in a speech to a us electronic industries trade association 
mosbacher sounded a tough line with japan the country running the 
largest trade surplus with the united states 
he said american manufacturers of semiconductors and 
supercomputers were selling products that were second to none in the 
world 
but despite this strength these sectors have been unable to 
capture their fair share of world markets mosbacher told the 
electronic industries association our semiconductor industry 
especially has been hurt by unfair pricing practices around the 
world and lack of access to japans market the worlds largest 
market 
mosbacher said he realized that there were many cultural 
reasons behind japans desire to keep its markets closed but 
changes must come as painful as it might prove japan must open its 
semiconductor market to foreign producers 
mosbacher said the japanese were failing to live up to the spirit 
of a pledge they made in september 1986 to raise the foreign 
largely us share of their nations semiconductor market to 
slightly above 20 percent in five years 
at the time the us share of the japanese semiconductor market 
was around 8 percent it is now around 11 percent semiconductors 
are the thin wafers at the heart of computers and other electronic 
devices 
mosbacher has said in the past that japan will be unable to meet 
the 20 percent goal by 1991 unless it dramatically accelerates its 
marketopening efforts he has suggested that a more appropriate 
level of us semiconductor sales would be between 15 percent and 20 
percent by the end of this year 
mosbacher said american producers of supercomputers had only been 
able to capture 6 percent of the university and government market in 
japan in part because of the japanese practice of issuing technical 
specifications which favored japanese suppliers 
the reagan administration imposed higher tariffs on certain 
japanese electronic goods in 1987 because of the semiconductor 
dispute mosbacher said in wednesdays speech that president bush 
would lift those sanctions if japan demonstrated a greater 
commitment to opening the door to us products 
i know that president bush is quite willing to lift the 
sanctions that president reagan imposed mosbacher said but 
japan must give him a reason for doing so he must have continuing 
evidence of a more open market to act

energy futures prices rolled up impressive gains for a third 
straight session wednesday after a report showed a 
largerthanexpected drawdown in us gas stocks last week and saudi 
arabias announcement that it would cut allocations to us and 
european customers by as much as 30 percent 
on other markets precious metals plummeted despite some signs 
inflation was heating up and livestock futures were higher and pork 
futures mostly higher as traders awaited a key government report and 
tried to estimate demand in coming weeks 
energy futures took off from the opening bell stoked by an 
american petroleum institute api report released after the close 
of the markets tuesday that showed gasoline stocks down by 47 
million barrels and distillate stocks down by 59 million over the 
previous week 
the range of estimates preceding the api report ranged from no 
change to a drawdown of about 2 million barrels in gasoline stocks 
the largerthanexpected declines sent prices zooming gasoline 
took over leadership of the complex from crude oil and the april 
contract broke important resistance at 5450 cents a price level 
it had scaled three times since last spring but failed to surmount 
alos helping prices was a report that saudi arabia told the 
aramco partners which include most of the largest us and western 
european oil suppliers that their daily allotment of 13 million 
barrels would be cut between 20 and 30 percent for april 
the saudis apparently seeking to toe the opec line and keep 
within production quotas similarly cut japanese allotments a day 
earlier 
after today youre looking at the highest energy prices since 
the summer of 1987 but its hard to delineate what propelled the 
market said jim ritterbusch vice president of trading and 
research for carson petroleum 
the api report was a definite spark so was the saudis 
cutting back but once the shelf came out at 5450 there was a lot 
of panic 
crude oil settled 11 cents to 48 cents higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in april at 
1977 a barrel heating oil was 38 cent to 179 cents higher with 
april at 5419 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline soared 145 
cents to 230 cents higher with april at 5580 cents a gallon 
several analysts said the inflationary implications of higher 
energy prices may have been the major reason that the precious 
metals slumping in recent months didnt fall further wednesday 
precious metals viewed by investors as a hedge against 
inflation came under pressure at the start of the day after release 
of a betterthanexpected figure on the us trade deficit 
platinum slipped 11 to 1120 lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange with april at 53830 a troy ounce gold settled 410 to 
480 lower at the comex with march at 39210 a troy ounce and 
silver was 2 cents to 31 cents lower with march at 6091 a troy 
ounce 
it could have been worse if the oil prices hadnt worked to 
cushion the decline said craig sloane a metals analyst with 
smith barney harris upham amp co new york 
livestock futures posted modest gains although some traders 
stayed on the sidelines in anticipation of thursdays us 
department of agricultures report the report is expected to show 
slightly fewer cattle on feedlots than at the same time last year 
but some traders suspect the weights might be lower indicating the 
animals will come to market later 
weve got recordhigh prices for beef at retail said chuck 
levitt analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc chicago but 
complicating things is the fact that the trade doesnt have a good 
handle on what demand is going to be like in the coming weeks 
live cattle were 20 cent to 42 cent higher with april at 7777 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 32 cent higher march 
at 8090 cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent lower to 25 cent 
higher with april at 4365 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies 
were 10 cent lower to 58 cent higher with march at 3815 cents a 
pound 
grain and soybeans prices closed mixed to mostly lower on the 
chicago board of trade 
wheat was 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the contract for 
delivery in march at 437 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 
cent higher with march at 277 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 1 
cents lower with march at 208 a bushel and soybeans were 2 
cents lower to 2 cents higher with march at 766 a bushel

the house passed legislation wednesday that 
would require a recalcitrant president bush to name an emergency 
panel to try to end the devastating machinists union strike against 
eastern airlines 
the laborbacked bill was approved on a mostly party line 252167 
vote by the house where most of the majority democrats are 
sympathetic to the airlines unions 
rep glenn anderson dcalif chairman of the house public works 
committee said the measure offers the best hope of resolving the 
current labor dispute which threatens the survival of eastern 
airlines 
but rep john paul hammerschmidt rark ranking gop member of 
the public works committee said the emergency panel was not needed 
because despite the strike there is no national transportation 
emergency 
the measure was considered a long shot to become law because of 
opposition from the bush administration but house passage of the 
legislation seems to score several political points for unions and 
their democratic allies 
it forces bush and his republican supporters to resist a measure 
that is also opposed by frank lorenzo the chairman of easterns 
parent company texas air corp lorenzo is a widely unpopular figure 
on capitol hill where he has been criticized by democrats 
republicans and even transportation secretary samuel k skinner for 
his business practices 
it focuses attention on bushs refusal to follow the 
recommendation of the national mediation board which urged the 
president to name an emergency panel on feb 24 eight days before 
the walkout since 1926 the mediation board has asked presidents to 
name emergency panels in 34 airline disputes and they have always 
consented until bushs refusal 
it also demonstrates that labor which was often battered during 
the reagan administration years can still move legislation in 
congress 
the bill would give the president one day after enactment to 
appoint a board which would study the dispute and offer a 
recommendation to end the strike while the board did its work 
there would be a coolingoff period of up to 26 days during which 
eastern would have to pay prestrike wages to its workers 
supporters say the neutral boards recommendations could offer a 
facesaving way for the two sides to reach an agreement without 
seeming to make concessions if labor or management reject the 
proposed solution congress could later impose it with separate 
legislation they argue 
opponents argue that an emergency panel is not needed because the 
strike has caused inconvenience but not a national emergency they 
also say the board would have little chance of solving a bitter 
battle that has been building for 17 months 
the 8500 members of the international association of machinists 
which represents mechanics baggage handlers and other ramp workers 
walked off their jobs march 4 eastern was seeking a new contract 
with 125 million in wage and benefit concessions while the workers 
wanted 50 million in improvements the airline said it was losing 
15 million a day before the strike and has lost 1 billion over 
the last decade 
the airlines pilots and flight attendants have joined the 
walkout forcing eastern to pare its 1040flightsperday schedule 
back to about 100 on march 9 eastern sought protection from its 
creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code making 
the carriers future murky 
the bill would also require that the emergency board recommend 
terms for new contracts between eastern and its pilots and flight 
attendants unions both of whose contracts have expired 
the legislations future in the senate is shakey because under 
the chambers procedures a minority of lawmakers can kill a bill 
bush has said he opposes the measure arguing that labor and 
management must work out a solution between themselves 
administration officials have indicated bush would veto the measure 
should it ever emerge from congress

federal safety officials announced wednesday an 
investigation of alleged rollover danger in ford bronco iis after 
finding the bronco fared worst in an accident study which cleared 
the suzuki samurai of similar allegations 
an engineering analysis which is the second of three levels of 
investigation conducted by the national highway traffic safety 
administration will cover 19841989 bronco iis an agency spokesman 
said 
studies of vehicle fatalities showed the fourwheeldrive bronco 
ii has had more fatal rollovers than other vehicles in its class 
even taking into account miles traveled and the number of vehicles 
in use said spokesman tim hurd 
according to a fatal accident reporting system study included in 
a 1988 report on the samurai 43 bronco ii singlevehicle rollovers 
caused fatalities or 19 for every 100000 vehicles there were 8 
samurai fatal rollovers or 6 per 100000 vehicles 13 involving the 
chevrolet s10 blazers or gmc jimmy or 6 per 100000 and 6 fatal 
jeep cherokee rollovers for 25 per 100000 
ford motor co in a statement from detroit said it believes the 
record of its 590000 bronco iis is not significantly different from 
that of other utility vehicles 
the bronco ii is a welldesigned safe utility vehicle and 
ford believes that the accident statistics do not reflect any 
safetyrelated defect in the vehicle the company said adding 
that accidents in all such vehicles are strongly influenced by 
adverse driver or environmental factors 
spokeswoman barbara mansfield said ford has done extensive 
testing on the bronco ii to verify it has reasonable and 
appropriate handling and stability characteristics 
hurd speaking for the highway safety administration said the 
ford bronco ii appears to have a higher number of singlevehicle 
firstevent rollovers particularly those involving fatalities 
in the process of studying rollovers we began to get curious 
about the bronco he said 
hurd said investigators will analyze rollovers involving the 
sportutility vehicle to determine if environment types of drivers 
or the vehicle itself might have contributed to the accidents 
he said that although the call for an engineering analysis of the 
bronco ii was formally based on letters to the safety 
administration it is also the result of the samurai investigation 
and extensive study into rollovers he said there have been several 
petitions for the agency to adopt rollover standards covering all 
vehicles 
last august the agency concluded that critics of the samurai 
failed to demonstrate the little truck has an excessive tendency to 
roll over and denied a recall petition filed by the center for auto 
safety a publicinterest group often at odds with the auto industry 
and its regulators 
consumer reports magazine in a july 1988 issue also called for 
a ban of the samurai saying it literally trips over its own 
feet the magazines publisher consumer union petitioned the 
safety administration to draft regulations to guard against 
rollovers 
in other action wednesday the highway safety agency announced 
the start of several preliminary evaluations the lowest level of 
investigation they included allegations of 
parking brake failures in selected models of 198084 ford motor 
co cars 
exhaust gas intrusion into the passenger compartment of 198687 
ford taurus and mercury sable cars following 10 complaints 795000 
of the vehicles were manufactured 
locking of the power steering mechanism in 198689 ford 
aerostar vans following seven complaints involving three two 
injuries and two fatalities 350000 have been built were built aero 
possible heater hose misrouting which may cause fires in 
ambulance conversions built by more than 40 manufacturers 
in addition the safety agency closed investigations into 
unsubstantiated reports of 
broken drivers seats in 198487 chrysler caravan and dodge 
voyager vans 
defective power steering hoses in 1986 buick lesabres 
steering column problems in 1988 f150 ford pickup trucks
