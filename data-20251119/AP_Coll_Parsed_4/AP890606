a standard test of kidney functioning may signal 
a higher risk of dying within eight years in people with high blood 
pressure including death from heart attack or stroke a new study 
suggests 
the blood test is for a muscle byproduct called creatinine and 
it is not clear why the substance would have anything to do with 
heart attack or stroke said study coauthor neil shulman 
but he said his work suggests that people with high creatinine 
levels and high blood pressure should pay extra attention to 
reducing smoking cutting cholesterol and taking other steps to 
reduce their risk of heart attack and stroke 
its sort of like a flashing light saying im in a highrisk 
group i better pay attention he said monday in a telephone 
interview 
shulman associate professor of medicine at emory university 
school of medicine in atlanta and colleagues from several medical 
schools present the work in the may issue of the journal 
hypertension 
the study included 10768 people with high blood pressure it 
found that those with high levels of creatinine in their blood 
showed higher death rates from heart attack and stroke as well as 
kidney disease researchers said 
creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle tissue kidneys 
normally remove it from blood so high levels of creatinine 
remaining in the blood can signal kidney trouble a normal 
creatinine reading is usually considered to be 07 to 15 
milligrams per deciliter shulman said 
the new study found that people with a reading of 17 or higher 
showed more than three times the mortality from any cause within 
eight years than other people did 
death rates rose with rising creatinine levels starting with as 
low as 08 to 099 but with a marked jump at 15 shulman said 
about 23 percent of study subjects who showed creatinine levels 
of 15 to 169 were dead within eight years rising to nearly 30 
percent for those with levels between 17 and 199 shulman said 
still higher creatinine levels were associated with death rates of 
about 40 percent and more than 50 percent 
in contrast people with levels of 07 to 109 showed death 
rates only around 10 percent he said 
in a separate analysis that took into account differences in age 
and other risk factors among the different groups creatinine 
levels remained a potent predictor of death within eight years 
shulman said

wilson originally was to leave monday for london to discuss hong 
kongs future with members of the british house of commons foreign 
affairs committee he delayed his departure to wednesday because of 
the developments in china 
in london some lawmakers called for a reconsideration of the 
agreement but british foreign secretary geoffrey howe reaffirmed 
britains agreement to the accord 
under a chinesebritish agreement signed in 1984 china has said 
the territory can maintain its capitalistic lifestyle under a one 
country two systems concept run by hong kong people without 
chinese interference 
ming pao a chineselanguage daily respected for its china 
coverage said a young guard fired four shots at chinese premier li 
peng in the great hall of the people on sunday and the premier was 
hit in the thigh he was not seriously injured and the guard was 
killed the newspaper reported

center after london and new york 
some banks said their rate of withdrawal was 30 percent higher 
than usual but no figures were available 
i think they have gone mad said martin lee an outspoken

as the scope of solidaritys massive 
election victory became clear lech walesa sent some advice to his 
friend president bush keep promoting investment in poland 
then the shipyard electrician who rallied a restless people to 
challenge the communist system got into his blue volkswagen van on 
monday afternoon and drove off down the streets of this proud port 
city 
international labor hero walesa still retains a host of folksy 
touches nearly nine years after strikes at the lenin shipyard that 
spawned solidarity catapulted him to fame and a nobel peace prize 
he walked with wife danuta and 19yearold son bogdan to 
cast his ballot at city polling station no 169 in sundays 
historic elections 
a young woman outside the polling station gave him a red rose 
and praised his tireless efforts 
walesa replied with a smile well i didnt do all this just 
for myself 
like many busy men wrapped up in their work walesa has trouble 
taking time off 
we hope you can go on vacation you deserve it the rev 
henryk jankowski a close adviser told him as 3000 people cheered 
outside st brygidas church we hope you can go to america 
only half of jankowskis wish is officially scheduled now 
walesa is heading to the united states this fall for a speech to 
the aflcio and most likely another meeting with bush 
in fact bush is heading over to the walesas for lunch next 
month 
there the president will sit down to a traditional polish meal 
with the 45yearold walesa his wife and at least some of the 
couples eight children in a pleasant residential area outside 
central gdansk 
this is a rehearsal for bushs visit walesa said with a 
hearty laugh as he acted as host at a private party on election eve 
at his singlefamily home on 54 polanki street 
bush will sit at a plain wooden table surrounded by paintings 
of nature scenes and religious motifs 
when walesa shows bush into the living room the president will 
see a picture of pope john paul ii on the wall my highest 
authority is the way roman catholic walesa refers to his 
polishborn hero and mentor in the vatican 
bush and walesa met when bush as vice president visited warsaw 
in 1987 a photograph of the two conferring adorns the wall outside 
walesas office in the gritty local headquarters of solidarity two 
blocks from the shipyard 
like any folk hero walesa has his trademarks the handlebar 
mustache the solidarity badge the black madonna of czestochowa 
pin on his lapel 
less wellknown is his bluntness 
on monday the labor federation leader wearing a blue 
sportcoat bulldozed through reporters seeking a statement from him 
on election results 
walesa said the voting shows poles want very big reforms but 
also cautioned we have to keep searching further to solve the 
nations woes 
then he bounded up the steps back into the st brygidas rectory 
to cap a victory he has been seeking along with his larger 
successes assuring the future of the lenin shipyard 
in what he called an act of providence polishborn american 
multimillionaire barbara piaseckajohnson stepped in with a promise 
of a huge investment to rescue the ailing yard from a 
governmentordered shutdown 
after lunch with mrs piaseckajohnson her advisers and members 
of the communistpicked shipyard management monday walesa used the 
occasion to promote the next phase of his cause reform of polands 
faltering and often chaotic economy 
all our political victories will mean nothing if we dont 
improve the economy said walesa 
poland faces constant shortages of consumer goods spare parts 
and food items many poles disillusioned with the countrys plight 
seek work in west germany the united states and elsewhere 
to ease the situation poland has been seeking to attract 
foreign investment the bush administration recently began leading 
the cheers for polands success in that area 
what mrs piaseckajohnson is doing is a continuation of what 
president bush has already told us walesa said in reference to 
us administration support for polish economic reforms she is 
fulfilling it immediately 
so i am sending a personal letter through her to the president 
in which i thank him for wanting to meet poland halfway walesa 
said 
walesa then handed mrs piaseckajohnson a plain white envelope 
containing the letter for bush as news photographers cameras 
clicked and tv cameras whirred

the general accounting office has concluded 
that the chief medical officer of the veterans administration did 
not try to improperly dictate the outcome of a study of death rates 
in va hospitals an agency spokesman said monday night 
however the study does conclude that expressions of concern by 
dr john gronvall over the impact of such a study on the va image 
led some people to believe he was giving such instructions 
said don smith a spokesman for the department of veterans affairs 
successor to the va 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate veterans 
committee asked for the gao investigation after the washington 
post reported last october that gronvall had ordered a change in 
methodology to lower the percentage of va hospitals showing 
abnormal death rates 
the newspaper reported results of the study in tuesday editions 
the telephone number listed for the author of the study was 
answered by someone who said he no longer lives there 
smith said he had seen a copy of the gao report earlier in the 
day 
gronvall was travelling and could not be reached but judging by 
his letter to gao contained in the report commenting in the 
findings i think he feels somewhat vindicated said smith 
the dispute arose when another va staff member the late dr 
francis e conrad argued in memos that chaging the study methods 
could be seen as self serving 
the issue is what statistical cutoff to use in judging whether 
death rates are within the normal range of variation only six of 
the vas 172 hospitals 35 percent would be judged to have 
abnormal death rates if the analyst wants to be 99 percent sure 
that the determination is not the result of normal fluctations but 
if the analyst wants to be 95 percent sure 12 hospitals or 7 
percent would be judged to have abnormal death rates 
va began the study after the health care financing 
administration found that 25 percent of the nations private 
hospitals had abnormally high death rates 
smith said va and the financing agency kept records differently 
and the percentages arrived at by the two studies could not be 
compared 
the veterans department plans to release its study next week 
using both statistical cutoffs smith said

a railroad and a fuelshipping 
company announced plans monday to reimburse residents of a 
neighborhood stricken by twin disasters last month 
the deal outlines community reparations promises 5000 for 
each family evacuated assures residents that the site is safe and 
calls for a study of utilities in the area 
for the calnev pipe line co the agreement cleared city 
objections to plans to replace its 14inch diameter petroleum fuel 
line which exploded in a deadly fireball on may 25 about two 
weeks after a southern pacific train derailed on may 12 
four people including two residents were killed in the 
derailment and two residents were killed in the pipeline 
explosion dozens more were injured in the explosion 
national transportation safety board investigators have focused 
on the possibility that the outofcontrol freight damaged the 
nearby pipeline as it vaulted from the tracks 
the plan was announced jointly by city officials executives of 
calnev and the southern pacific transportation co and us rep 
george e brown of san bernardino 
no court would have ordered them to do what theyve agreed to 
do today city attorney james penman said the question now is 
whether this is going to be finalized 
one of the things city officials had sought was immediate 
assistance for displaced families and penman said that 5000 
reimbursement really helps 
the 5000 is to be paid to each family that returns to their 
home calnev officials said the payments estimated to total about 
750000 would begin wednesday 
what the agreement is today is a first crack at getting 
started said anthony j andrukaitis vice president of gatx 
terminals calnevs corporate owner it is nowhere near a 
comprehensive settlement 
the companies tentatively agreed to reimburse the city for 
overtime paid for police fire and other emergency personnel 
continue to pay for housing and meals for displaced families and to 
buy the homes that were destroyed or severely damaged 
the new pipeline will buried at least six feet deep twice the 
federal standard and covered with concrete for 600 feet the length 
of the rail disaster area andrukaitis said 
if we can get the new line in by wednesday wed test it 
thursday and possibly be operating by friday andrukaitis said 
mayor wr holcomb said monday that 95 homes out of the 178 that 
were evacuated would be immediately reopened for residents return 
all the environmental and safety experts agree on the safety 
and integrity of the area holcomb said 
the city attorney emphasized calnevs support for a federal 
study of the placement of gasoline natural gas pipelines and other 
vital utilities in the greater san bernardino area if the study 
recommends moving the calnev fuel line the company has agreed to 
do it penman said 
the proposed engineering study would examine the sort of 
juxtaposition that apparently played a role in the double disasters

house members have flooded the rules committee 
with more than 100 proposed amendments to savings and loan bailout 
legislation dimming the chances of floor action this week 
the bush administration which announced its sampl proposal on 
feb 6 and challenged congress to act within 45 days has shown 
increasing impatience with the pace of action in the house 
the rules committee chaired by rep joe moakley of 
massachusetts the ranking democrat after the death last week of 
former chairman claude pepper is scheduled to consider the sampl 
legislation on tuesday 
it will decide which amendments will be considered by the full 
house when it takes up sampl legislation written by the banking 
judiciary and ways and means panels 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash told moakley last 
week that he wants the rules panel to finish work tuesday so the 
house can take up the bill on wednesday 
however nearly 50 house members have asked to speak to the 
rules committee and the panel must wade through more than 109 
amendments a difficult task to achieve in one day 
if the rules committee finished work wednesday the full house 
could begin debate on thursday but since the chamber is out of 
session on friday any vote likely would be delayed until next week 
the senate passed this thing on april 19 and the losses in 
sampls have grown by over 500 million since that date said 
assistant treasury secretary david w mullins 
the industry is just hemorrhaging out there and every day they 
delay passage costs at least 10 million he said 
more than half a dozen of the amendments under consideration 
would weaken what the administration considers the key change in 
the bill a requirement that sampl owners invest at least 3 in 
tangible or real money capital for every 100 in lending a 
high capital level acts as a buffer absorbing losses before 
federal deposit insurance kicks in 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions had planned to offer an 
amendment that would allow regulators at their discretion to 
count supervisory goodwill as tangible capital but pulled back 
after the administration decided to oppose it 
the washington post reported in tuesday editions that rep james 
quillen rtenn planned to urge the rules committee to allow the 
house to vote on an amendment that would weaken restrictions on 
counting goodwill as tangible capital it said the measure would 
benefit several hundred sampls including heritage federal savings 
loan of kingsport tenn where quillen has at least 200000 on 
deposit 
wendell kirk chief executive of the sampl was quoted by the 
newspaper as saying that without the amendment the institution 
would have to come up with cash to replace 28 million in goodwill 
it currently counts as capital kirk was quoted as saying he asked 
quillen to sponsor the measure 
kirk said the amendments effect on quillen would be minimal 
perhaps 250 and added if you try to pin a conflict on him it 
would be criminal it would be low down quillen was quoted as 
saying in my mind there is no conflict of interest efforts 
to reach him by telephone monday night were unsuccessful 
supervisory goodwill is an accounting break offered by 
regulators in the early 1980s to institutions that took ailing sampls 
off the governments hands 
annunzio argues that it is unfair to penalize sampls who took the 
accounting break at the governments urging however the 
administration argues that it is unfair to taxpayers to allow the 
institutions with supervisory goodwill to operate with none of 
their owners money at risk 
annunzio and other house members from illinois including 
republican leader bob michel met with treasury and white house 
officials last thursday in attempt to secure the administrations 
support for their compromise amendment however mullins said the 
proposal is simply not acceptable to us 
as an alternate annunzio will back an amendment by rep henry 
hyde rill that would permit institutions with goodwill to use 
administrative appeals to delay the imposition of tougher capital 
rules for up to 18 months 
other amendments before the rules committee would if permitted 
to reach the house floor reopen virtually every major battle 
already fought in the committees that wrote the bill 
several amendments would delete provisions designed to help 
provide housing to poor people others would weaken the requirement 
that the sampl industry contribute 300 million a year to pay 
interest on government bailout borrowing

street in southeastern beijing 
hundreds of people were killed saturday when troops shot beat 
and crushed students and other protesters who had been occupying 
tiananmen square since may 13 demonstrating for democratic reforms 
and against corruption 
chinese and diplomatic sources said the 38th army which is 
commissioned with defending the beijing area was preparing to move

thigh sunday in the great hall of the people it said lis wound 
was not severe and that his assailant was immediately shot to death

shelling was heard in a far northwest suburb of the city 
nine tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers left the square 
tuesday morning heading eastward 
at least three people died and four were injured monday as 
troops armed with machine guns and automatic rifles kept up 
sporadic indiscriminate firing 
chinese witnesses said the dead included a man machinegunned 
from his chin to his stomach the wounded included a girl shot in 
the chest when troops charged up a narrow residential street

in shanghai chinas most populous city all public 
transportation stopped monday as people moved buses and other 
barricades into intersections thousands of people joined funeral 
marches through nanjing on monday and students blocked major 
streets to prevent buses from running 
chinese sources said defense minister qin jiwei was stripped of 
power for opposing the decision of senior leader deng xiaoping to 
end seven weeks of student demonstrations with military force 
despite repeated announcements on chinese television praising 
the military action against the people of the capital no national 
leader has appeared in public or on television to take 
responsibility for the military takeover of beijing 
the student unrest triggered a major power struggle in the 
chinese leadership with deng li and other conservative hardliners 
gaining the upper hand and reportedly stripping power from 
communist party general secretary zhao ziyang who favored making 
concessions to the students 
there was a chorus of condemnation from around the world at the 
armys attack on the demonstrators in washington president bush 
said he would suspend all military sales and visits of chinese 
military leaders but announced that diplomatic ties would not be 
severed 
the american british and other embassies were evacuating some 
of their nationals from beijing universities out of fear troops 
would move onto campuses to stifle antigovernment activities 
a beijing university student said many of the chinese 
students have left the dormitories to go home or to find shelter in 
beijing because they fear an imminent attack by the army 
the hong kong government sent a special flight monday to 
evacuate residents of the british colony 
residents in beijing spent the day preparing for food shortages 
with lines forming for milk oil soy sauce and other staples 
blockades of buses and burning vehicles made major streets 
impassable and many beijing residents stayed home from work out of 
fear of the roaming bands of soldiers 
one convoy of 50 to 100 military trucks rumbled through the 
diplomatic quarter firing indiscriminately a us embassy official 
said more than 40 soldiers later swaggered down the main street 
bordering the diplomatic section firing in the air residents 
scattered but reappeared to shout jeers after the soldiers 
beijing residents enraged by the shooting defied the heavily 
armed military by blockading streets and vowing continued support 
for the prodemocracy students many wore black armbands to honor 
the dead 
its not over its just getting started said a 38yearold 
educator outside the main gate of beijing normal university where 
hundreds of people gathered to back the students 
the people have just found out what democracy is really 
about 
on man climbed on top of the lead vehicle of a 20tank convoy 
he got down but again moved to block its way when the tank tried to 
drive around him several people had to drag him to safety 
the official media continued to defend the military crackdown on 
unarmed civilians as a justified battle against thugs and 
ruffians 
the national television station late monday showed footage of 
young people throwing rocks at troops and military personnel 
carriers entering the city 
one segment showed people attacking a stalled truck heaving 
rocks through the windshield and saying the two soldiers inside 
were beaten to death

civil rights advocates are accusing the 
supreme court of abandoning the nations 25yearold commitment to 
fair treatment in the workplace for minorities and women 
they expressed alarm and dismay over a ruling monday they said 
undercuts the civil rights act of 1964 and will make it far more 
difficult for workers to prove with statistical evidence that they 
are victims of racial or gender bias 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights said if the 
court continues down this path the civil rights laws will be just 
an empty shell 
but edwards did not predict any immediate action in congress to 
reverse the 54 court ruling 
its a major step backwards said patrick patterson of the 
naacp legal defense and educational fund the court has made it 
much more difficult for plaintiffs to win and at the same time 
has made it easier for employers to defend themselves 
barry goldstein also with the fund predicted civil rights 
lawyers now will concentrate on cases where they can prove 
intentional discrimination and seek big money damages to punish 
employers who discriminate 
it is going to make litigation a lot tougher and a lot 
nastier he said it means fewer cases and bigger awards 
but business leaders hailed the ruling and said most employers 
will remain committed to affirmative action even if the threat of 
losing lawsuits is reduced 
stephen bokat of the us chamber of commerce said im really 
pleased it went much further than i thought the court would go 
this means fewer specious cases will be brought employers are 
going to be able to defend these cases more easily he said 
mondays ruling focused on socalled disparate impact cases 
where allegations of bias are based on statistics showing 
underrepresentation for minorities rather than deliberate 
discrimination 
the decision divided the high court sharply and prompted bitter 
remarks from the dissenting justices 
one wonders whether the majority still believes that race 
discrimination or more accurately race discrimination against 
nonwhites is a problem in our society or even remembers that it 
ever was said justice harry a blackmun in a dissenting opinion 
the court overturned a lower court ruling that had favored 
filipinos alaska natives and asians employed during the summer at 
alaska salmon canneries the minority groups said they have been 
relegated to the lowerpaying jobs there 
the justices sent the case back to the lower courts with 
instructions to use the high courts new guidelines making it more 
difficult for the minority groups to win their lawsuit 
justice byron r white writing for the court said that when 
minorities use statistics to show they are bias victims employers 
only must produce evidence that there is a legitimate reason for 
apparently neutral business practices 
the burden of proving the practices are nondiscriminatory of 
persuading a jury there is no bias does not shift to the 
employer white said 
he added that the workers must suggest alternative practices 
that do not have an unfair impact on minorities but said employers 
cannot be forced to adopt the alternatives if they are more costly 
the court also limited the statistical evidence that minorities 
can use to prove discrimination 
for example white said a lack of minority group members in 
skilled jobs is not evidence of bias if the absence reflects a 
dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants for reasons that are not 
the employers fault 
he said the minority groups must show that any 
underrepresentation in skilled jobs is tied directly to specific 
business practices under attack 
white said that without such protection for employers their only 
recourse to eliminate racial imbalance in their work forces would 
be unlawful quotas 
in other action the court 
ruled 52 that the main method used by the church of 
scientology to receive money from members does not entitle them to 
federal income tax deductions 
handed artists and authors a victory by unanimously ruling that 
a homelessrights group in the nations capital does not hold 
exclusive copyright to a sculpture it commissioned an artist to 
create 
cleared the way for trial of a government lawsuit against junk 
bond specialist michael milken and removed a major obstacle to a 
650 million payment by his former employer to investors and the 
federal treasury 
rejected an appeal by medicare patients who want to use their 
own money to pay for an assistant surgeon in eye cataract 
operations

president bush once suggested that the more he 
learned about the chinese the less he understood them now his 
experience in china is a guiding influence in setting us policy 
toward the troubled giant 
in his announcement monday of a cutoff in us arms sales to 
protest the bloody suppression of chinas prodemocracy movement 
the governments no 1 china hand said he took the action because 
he understands china reasonably well 
for that reason bush said the events of the past few days could 
only leave him with a saddened heart 
i am trying to take steps that will encourage a peaceful 
change and yet recognize the fact that china does have a great 
pride in its own history and my recommendations are based on my 
knowledge of chinese history bush said 
that doesnt mean he understands what has happened said bush 
who less than four months ago shook hands with bicyclists in 
beijings tiananmen square presented texas cowboy boots to prime 
minister li peng and bantered about exercise regimens with senior 
leader deng xiaoping 
of the military assault that left hundreds dead and thousands 
wounded bush said i condemn it i dont try to explain it 
asked for his best assessment of the political situation in 
china bush also demurred its too obscure he said at a news 
conference monday 
but china expertise has always been a major element of the 
wellladen foreignpolicy resume that bush brought to the oval 
office 
for bush who headed the us liaison office in beijing for 16 
months in 197475 and since then has visited the nation five times 
this expertise is also the source of extreme caution a caution 
that previously provoked criticism 
in his 1987 preelection autobiography looking forward 
bush wrote that during his tour of duty in china he often had the 
feeling the more you learn about the chinese the less you really 
understand them 
i have a special affection for the chinese people ive kept 
up my knowledge of china and my relationship with various leaders 
there he told a business audience monday night 
although house and senate leaders of both parties were near 
unanimous in their praise for bushs stern but careful actions 
monday his reticence in speaking out for human rights when he 
visited beijing in late february prompted criticism 
the criticism intensified when a dissident he invited to a 
farewell banquet astrophysicist fang lizhi was barred by chinese 
police from attending the ceremony 
still bush defended this caution anew on monday while issuing 
his strongest criticism thus far of the chinese government this 
is not a time for anything other than a prudent reasoned 
response he said 
bush said his actions monday will deny the chinese more than 
600 million worth of us government military equipment sales and 
an estimated 85 million or so annually in private arms sales 
he also banned visits by chinese military officials offered 
humanitarian and medical assistance to those wounded in the assault 
and suggested that the united states would extend the visas of 
chinese students here afraid to return to their homeland 
bush however said he was not ready to do something more 
flamboyant such as recommend trade sanctions or recall the us 
ambassador because i happen to believe that this relationship is 
vital to the united states 
bush suggested as he has in the past that hes sensitive to 
chinas own sensitivity to outside criticism 
china historically has been less than totally interested in 
what other countries think of their performance bush said 
still he expressed hope that the depth of the feeling towards 
democracy is so great that you cant put the genie back in the 
bottle and return to total repression 
bushs actions won support from many on capitol hill 
this is a time to allow the president to lead on that kind of 
issue especially when you have a president with this level of 
personal expertise in chinese affairs said sen david boren 
dokla chairman of the senate intelligence committee

vestiges of school segregation remain in 
topeka 35 years after it lost the brown vs board of education 
decision which paved the way for desegregation of schools 
nationwide a federal appeals court ruled 
the 10th us court of appeals panels decision made available 
monday reversed a ruling that would have closed the case that 
found separate but equal schools for blacks and whites 
unconstitutional 
the case was reopened 10 years ago by parents who said topekas 
schools were still segregated 
we won said rich jones an attorney representing the 
parents of 17 black schoolchildren we feel that 10 years of work 
was not in vain we feel vindicated by the decision its been 
quite a long time coming 
the group involved in the lawsuit included parent linda brown 
buckner who was a student when her name went on the original 
lawsuit 
my first reaction was shock then i was pleased very 
pleased said cheryl brown henderson buckners sister i 
believe that the case showed that there is a lot of educational 
enhancement that is not taking place here 
in its decision published in denver on friday the panel 
rejected us district judge richard rogers contention in april 
1987 that parents of minority students had to prove a pattern of 
intentional discrimination to force the district to come up with a 
plan for more racially balanced schools 
because we are convinced that topeka has not sufficiently 
countered the effects of both the momentum of its prebrown 
segregation and its subsequent segregative acts in the 1960s we 
reverse the appeals court said the judges also reversed a lower 
court ruling that the topeka school district had not violated title 
vi of the civil rights act of 1964 
gary sebelius an attorney for the the school district said 
officials were awaiting receipt of the dissenting opinion in the 
21 ruling before deciding whether to appeal 
he added that the ruling confirmed the high quality of topekas 
schools 
throughout their decision they note that topeka offers 
excellent educational opportunities to all its students wherever 
they be sebelius said there was absolutely no hint or contest 
of the quality education the district provides 
the court noted that neither the school district nor the topeka 
community was actively resisting desegregation and cited the 
national recognition of the districts innovative curriculum 
this active engagement has largely been directed at concerns 
other than desegregation however the appeals court said for 
the most part the topeka school district has exercised a form of 
benign neglect 
the original classaction lawsuit challenged the 
constitutionality of a kansas law authorizing school segregation 
the may 17 1954 supreme court decision paved the way for 
nationwide school desegregation and busing 
topeka schools were required to submit an integration plan 
which was approved in 1955 
in 1979 the case was revived by black parents who claimed 
topeka had failed to desegregate its schools rogers found the 
school district to be integrated and unified 
local officials of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people at the time blasted rogers decision saying 
blacks could not get a fair hearing because of racism in topeka 
the appeals court ruled that the districts policy of permitting 
students to attend neighborhood schools was insufficient to 
desegregate schools because neighborhoods are still racially 
segregated topeka is 90 percent white 
there are about 14000 students in the city school district

us and soviet naval accidents have littered 
the ocean floor with at least 50 nuclear weapons and 10 nuclear 
reactors since world war ii according to a report released today 
by the greenpeace environmental group 
fortythree of the 50 weapons and six of the nine reactors are 
soviet and the real number may be much higher because so few 
details are known of secretive soviet navy operations said william 
arkin an analyst who worked with greenpeace on the project 
we got no information at all from the soviets said arkin 
who works at the institute for policy studies a liberal washington 
interest group we were totally unsuccessful in getting any kind 
of real response from them and we were totally unsuccessful in 
getting any information from us intelligence about soviet naval 
accidents 
using material obtained from the us government under the 
freedom of information act the researchers listed 1276 accidents 
since world war ii involving military vessels 
the accidents caused more than 2800 deaths and ranged in 
severity from the loss of an entire vessel and crew to minor 
collisions and fires that caused little damage and few if any 
injuries 
greenpeace said that of the accidents 228 involved aircraft 
carriers 406 other major surface warships 182 supply ships 142 
minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels separately 75 
incidents involved sinkings 
twentyseven submarines have sunk in that period including five 
soviet four american four french and three british as well as 
submarines from west germany israel pakistan peru spain and 
turkey the analysts reported in their 101page study 
perhaps the most serious accident was the sinking of a soviet 
yankeeclass submarine on oct 6 1986 with 32 nuclear warheads 
and two nuclear torpedoes aboard 600 miles northeast of bermuda 
more recently a soviet mike class submarine sank off the 
coast of norway in april with two nuclear reactors and two nuclear 
tipped torpedoes aboard the report said 
between 19751985 according to the us navy the soviet 
union had over 200 serious submarine accidents according to a 
summary of the report the soviet union has had more sinkings 
more propulsion failures and according to us intelligence 
sources more accidents than the united states 
greenpeace earlier revealed information about two us accidents 
that received wide publicity over the past month in 1965 an a4 
warplane fell off the uss ticonderoga off okinawa with a hydrogen 
bomb aboard and on nov 22 1975 a fire aboard the uss belknap 
came within 40 feet of nuclear weapons 
although the report carried the greatest detail about incidents 
involving us vessels its sharpest criticism was of the soviets 
arkin said he planned to deliver a russianlanguage version of the 
study to the soviet embassy in washington and would seek a meeting 
with soviet officials 
official secrecy particularly that of the soviet union as 
well as sporadic news media interest in reporting routine 
accidents are major impediments to compiling a complete record 
the report said 
of the 1276 accidents 799 have involved naval ships of the 
united states it said this preponderance of us accidents 
does not mean a higher accident rate than other navies 
particularly the soviet navy 
many hundreds more soviet accidents are known to have 
occurred but due to inadequate data and excessive secrecy we have 
been unable to document specific dates or circumstances it said 
asked in a telephone interview to give an example of a soviet 
naval accident in which nuclear weapons or reactors were suspected 
but not documented to be involved arkin cited the sinking of a 
destroyer in the black sea in 1974 
a kashinclass destroyer with 275 crewmen sank with all hands 
our speculation is that there were probably nuclear torpedoes 
aboard said arkin

a woman who got a semen sample from a friend and 
bore a child then got a court to rule that the man had no rights 
as the father has been dealt a setback by the colorado supreme 
court 
the juvenile court judge who held that the friend was not 
technically the father must take another look at the case to 
determine precisely what the preconception agreement between the 
two was the high court ruled monday 
the woman had argued that she never promised to recognize her 
friend as the father and that even if she had state law specifies 
that sperm donors have no parental rights court papers identified 
the couple only by initials 
records showed that in 1985 jr donated semen to ec a woman 
he had known for two years a doctor inseminated her and she gave 
birth in 1986 
jr then sought a declaration he was the father alleging that 
he and ec had agreed in advance that he would be treated as the 
father 
he also argued that the law giving sperm donors no parental 
rights did not apply to unmarried women who knew the donor 
juvenile court judge morris e cole ruled that evidence of a 
preconception agreement was irrelevant 
but justice anthony vollack said that what the man and woman 
agreed to in advance is indeed relevant the high court cited a 
california case in which a sperm donor was declared the legal 
father and given visitation rights

like a paddlewheel steamer trailing in 
a mississippi river race illinois is trying to pass iowa in the 
riverboat gambling sweepstakes and pull in the fresh catch dollars 
backers of illinois legislation to legalize riverboat gambling 
say the payoff could be 2500 new jobs 200 million in initial 
riverfront investment and as much as 700 million a year in 
economic spinoffs 
the loser they say could be left at the dock 
iowa already has authorized riverboat gambling on the 
mississippi beginning in 1991 
the state there first is going to attract the people said 
sen denny jacobs sponsor of legislation to legalize riverboat 
gambling next year on the illinois side of the mississippi and much 
of the illinois river 
jacobs bill and one allowing betting on the des plaines river 
were overwhelmingly approved by the senate last month and are now 
in the house 
the proposals would allow blackjack poker slot machines and 
other games on 19thcenturystyle riverboats or casino cruise ships 
unlike the iowa legislation which limits bets to 5 and losses 
to 200 per person per excursion the illinois bills permit losses 
up to 500 gamblers can wager no more than an initial 5 but can 
parlay their winnings without limit

university to take over the troubled chelsea schools for 10 years 
in a 2910 vote monday the senate endorsed the 
firstinthenation plan for a private university to run a public 
school system 
chelsea schools have been woefully underfunded according to 
officials and the 3400 students in the largely workingclass and 
predominantly spanishspeaking city outside boston have one of the 
highest dropout rates in the state 
the bill now goes to the house which gave its approval last 
week but must consider a senate amendment requiring periodic 
reports to the state by bu 
mondays vote was criticized by teachers unions who say the plan 
would deprive teachers of access to important personnel records 
many officials including gov michael s dukakis have also 
criticized provisions exempting bu from open meeting laws 
dukakis has not said whether he will sign the legislation 
bu said it will raise money from foundations and corporations 
and offer a variety of programs including education of 
preschoolers and aid for pregnant teenagers 
the schoolchildren of chelsea are going to be very happy 
said bu spokesman ed king were going to abide by the open 
meeting and the public records laws and weve said all along were 
going to abide by those 
the fight is not over declared paul devlin president of 
the massachusetts federation of teachers which represents 
chelseas teachers the union has sued to block what he called an 
arrogant kind of takeover 
rosanne bacon president of the massachusetts teachers 
association called the takeover an embarassment for the state 
its outrageous that chelsea has been allowed to get to the 
condition its in she said

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was buried today 
after frenzied mourners knocked his body to the ground and ripped 
his white burial shroud to pieces for mementos of the revolutionary 
who ruled iran for 10 years 
thousands of revolutionary guards and civilians pushed and 
shoved around the graveside kicking up clouds of dust as 
khomeinis body was taken from a metal casket and lowered to the 
grave at 445 pm 
they are burying a sacred body screamed a television 
announcer his voice hoarse with emotion as soldiers piled 
concrete blocks on top of the shrouded body 
oh father dont leave your children oh father dont leave 
your beloved he wailed 
khomeini the driving force of irans islamic revolution died 
saturday at age 86 
amid scenes of mass hysteria the huge crowd surrounding the 
grave beat their heads with their hands in expressions of grief and 
threw dust on themselves to show they wanted to be buried with 
their spiritual patriarch 
several people were knocked unconscious in crushes at the 
cemetery and earlier at mosalla mosque where mourners stopped the 
nearly 10hour funeral procession 
they blocked the path of a van driving the body to the cemetery 
grabbed the corpse out of an open wooden coffin and ripped the 
shroud to pieces the body fell to the ground 
in the chaos khomeinis son was knocked down but appeared 
uninjured 
state television later showed mourners grabbing the body and 
pulling the shroud until the feet could be seen the broadcast 
then was cut off abruptly for several minutes 
the body was rewrapped placed in a closed metal casket and 
airlifted to the baheshte zahra cemetery with mourners clinging to 
the helicopters landing sled until it was several feet off the 
ground 
khomeini was buried next to iranians who helped him seize power 
in the 1979 revolution that toppled a 2500yearold monarchy and 
soldiers killed in the eightyear iraniraq war 
there was no immediate word on whether people were killed or 
injured in the crowd that gathered in 91degree heat at least 
eight people were killed and hundreds hurt on monday during a 
similar huge show of mass grief 
the chaos occurred when the grieving multitudes stopped the 
funeral procession a halfmile from the mosalla mosque where 
khomeinis body had lain in state since monday in an 
airconditioned glassencased bier 
two helicopters had landed nearby and officials were moving the 
body from a hearse to a helicopter when the crowd pushed toward 
them 
security forces fired in the air to disperse the crowds but the 
throngs remained irna reported 
earlier khomeinis son ahmad 43 was knocked down outside the 
mosque his black turban fell off as he was hoisted above the 
crowds and passed from hand to hand to an ambulance at the edge of 
the square he appeared pale and shaken 
the hearse carrying the body was stranded in a sea of mourners 
clad in black unable to move forward because of the crowds irna 
said 
shouts of allah akbar god is great echoed across the 
city 
many of tehrans 6 million people turned out to bid khomeini 
farewell millions more converged on the city from other regions 
the official media reported 
the procession began at 7 am when khomeinis devout militants 
the revolutionary guards carried his body down from the bier 
khomeinis body lay on the ground in the open air as the 
whitebearded ayatollah mohammadreza golpaygani prayed 
golapaygani one of the four remaining senior ayatollahs in iran 
lifted his spectacles to wipe tears with a handkerchief 
after the 30minute service khomeinis body was placed in a 
wooden coffin covered with a white cloth then carried by 
revolutionary guards from hand to hand into a white van 
crowds cried hysterically readings from the koran islams holy 
book blared from the mosques minaret as the masses cried 
farewell beloved imam and oh khomeini why have you left 
us 
in the chaos women clad in headtotoe black chadors were 
rubbing shoulders with men defying an islamic ban on physical 
contact between a woman and a man other than her husband 
firefighters sprayed mourners with water to cool them off 
about 2 million frenzied mourners had kept a nightlong 
candlelit vigil around the bier 
some scratched their faces until the blood ran and threw ashes 
over their clothes 
khomeini died of a heart attack 11 days after intestinal surgery 
without resolving the problem of who would succeed him he left a 
29page political testament excerpts of which were read over 
tehran radio on monday 
the excerpts made no reference to how iran should be governed 
after his death but such proposals may have been in sections not 
made public 
president ali khamenei 49 was appointed caretaker leader 
sunday a presidential election and referendum on constitutional 
reforms which are likely to increase the presidents executive 
power are scheduled for aug 18 
khameneis swift appointment was designed mainly to fill the 
vacuum amid political turmoil that has prevailed since khomeini 
launched his resurgence of islamic fundamentalism in february with 
a call for the death of british novelist salman rushdie 
in the absence of a single personality who can match khomeinis 
religious and political authority it seemed likely iran would be 
ruled by a collective leadership 
khamenei has endorsed the presidential candidacy of parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani 55 a political ally and the only 
declared candidate

democrats today nominated thomas s foley of 
washington as the 49th speaker of the house moving decisively to 
replace jim wright and end months of political tumult spawned by 
charges of ethical misconduct 
the full house was expected to ratify the majority democrats 
choice by the end of the day and foley was moving to set the tone 
for his stewardship 
i hope that this can be the beginning of the movement of the 
house back to the business for which the public elected us to 
serve he told reporters as he arrived at the capitol he said he 
hoped to quickly restore a mood of conciliation reconciliation 
and cooperation between the two parties 
foley unopposed was approved by the democratic caucus in a 
unanimous voice vote still to come perhaps next week were 
contests for other democratic leadership posts made vacant by the 
ethics turmoil including the no 2 position of majority leader 
held by foley 
republicans were powerless to stop foleys election since 
democrats command a 259175 majority but they voted this morning 
to nominate minority leader bob michel of illinois as their 
candidate for speaker in a symbolic act 
michel who by tradition was to introduce foley to the house 
told fellow republicans today that their party has been mistreated 
under democratic control and just getting rid of wright wont 
correct things by itself 
the house has been corrupted by the absolute power of 
oneparty domination and it isnt going to be cured by a 
personality transplant he said accepting his partys nomination 
the republican national committee already was attacking foley as 
a political enemy more liberal than his reputation indicated 
wright dtexas was driven from the leadership by ethics 
charges that he tried to skirt house rules on outside income he 
steadfastly maintained his innocence but said in a dramatic speech 
to his colleagues last week that he would step down to prevent the 
controversy from paralyzing the house 
republican strategists are trying to label all democrats as 
corrupt from an uninterrupted third of a century ruling the house 
they cite as examples wrights unprecedented decision to resign the 
speakership because of ethics charges and the announcement by 
majority whip tony coelho dcalif that hell step down to avoid 
an ethics inquiry 
foley who recognizes that democrats must not be seen as less 
ethical than republicans has said revising house ethics rules and 
campaign laws will be a top priority 
foley 60 of spokane is a 12year veteran of the house 
leadership with a reputation for negotiating the tough deals 
through persistence and compromise 
as majority leader foley was spared some of the pressure 
directed at the speakers office but republicans began firing at 
him before his election today 
mark goodin communications director of the republican national 
committee distributed a fourpage memorandum portraying foley as 
an ultraliberal who has cleverly managed to avoid any 
leftleaning label 
over the years foley has been able to create a reputation 
based on a false perception that he is a bipartisan moderate 
political creature goodin said the memo cited the relatively 
low marks over the years foleys voting record has earned from 
conservative groups 
foley declined to comment directly on the attack saying through 
a spokesman that he hoped to establish a sense of comity and 
respect within the house 
foley has represented the congressional district on the eastern 
side of washington since 1965 with a mostly mainstream democratic 
voting record he has had some close elections in that fairly 
conservative territory although wider margins in recent years 
foley entered the house leadership when former speaker thomas p 
oneill appointed him as majority whip a position which now is 
elected he earned a reputation as a master of compromise and when 
oneill retired at the end of 1986 and wright was elected speaker 
foley moved up uncontested to majority leader 
now as then foley refused to coast into his new slot instead 
of taking his votes for granted he tried to contact every democrat 
in the house to ask for their support 
out of courtesy foley waited to make the calls this time until 
wright last wednesday formally announced his resignation even 
though foley knew for months that wright was thinking of stepping 
down 
foley met monday with wright to discuss their transition 
although wright was resigning his speakership effective today he 
plans to remain in the house until later this month 
democrats plan to meet next week to fill their other leadership 
vacancies foleys post of majority leader and coelhos no 3 job 
of majority whip 
rep richard gephardt of missouri was favored over rep ed 
jenkins of georgia to succeed foley as majority leader 
gephardt who ran unsuccessfully last year for the democratic 
presidential nomination is considered the favorite to succeed 
foley jenkins is a popular member of the more conservative wing of 
the party 
the whips race is a contest among four alreadypowerful house 
democrats william h gray iii of pennsylvania the chairman of the 
house democratic caucus david bonior of michigan the chief deputy 
whip beryl anthony of arkansas chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee and henry waxman of california a 
leading member of the energy and commerce committee

two narcotics dealers who murdered a rookie 
policeman allegedly on orders from a drug lord were sentenced 
to the maximum 25 years to life in prison today as more than 100 
police officers cheered 
a third dealer received the same sentence may 16 for his role in 
the 1988 death of edward byrne whose slaying outside the home of a 
drug witness became an issue in the white house campaign and a 
battle cry for law enforcement 
justice thomas demakos in sentencing scott cobb and todd scott 
recommended that neither receive parole 
neither cobb 25 nor scott 20 addressed the judge 
demakos promised as he did at the sentencing of codefendant 
philip copeland that his last act as a judge would be to remind 
the parole board of his recommendation he labeled the pair unfit 
to live in society 
byrne 22 was shot five times in the head at close range while 
he sat in a patrol car guarding the home of a drug witness 
prosecutors charged that the officer was killed on orders from 
alleged drug lord howard pappy mason in retaliation for his 
jailing on a weapons charge 
mason has not been charged in the slaying and has denied 
involvement 
the slaying gained widespread attention during the white house 
campaign when byrnes father matthew presented his sons badge to 
george bush saying he supported him because of bushs support of 
the death penalty

without comment today

evidence against mason

the university of texas medical school 
says it will put stricter limits on plastic surgery on inmates two 
years after the legislature banned frivolous cosmetic surgery at 
taxpayer expense 
it is our intent to limit down so that we can stay out of 
trouble with everybody said dr alvin l leblanc vice president 
for hospital affairs we are going to try to please the 
legislature i can tell you that 
a rider to prison appropriations bills passed in 1987 and this 
year prohibits use of state money for cosmetic surgery on prisoners 
unless they are disfigured and suffer psychological problems 
because of it 
the university a state school operates a 120bed prison 
hospital in galveston 
the houston chronicle reported two months ago that hundreds of 
prisoners over the years have gotten facelifts liposuction fat 
removal and other cosmetic surgery 
the article quoted a 59yearold inmate who received face and 
brow lifts and liposuction as saying i think it will help my 
attitude and feeling about myself when i go back to the free 
world 
school officials were quoted as saying that the practice helps 
surgeons perfect their skills and improves prisoners outlook 
a prison policy that took effect april 28 requires that requests 
for cosmetic surgery be approved by the deputy director for medical 
services in the prison system and a university doctor officials 
said 
in the past prison psychiatrists could recommend the surgery 
leblanc said he was unaware of the legislatures limit on 
cosmetic surgery until contacted by the houston chronicle on monday 
jim lynaugh executive director of the texas department of 
corrections said we definitely were aware of that rider and 
have not violated it 
when my inmates check into that hospital i have no control of 
anything except security i dont control any medical practices in 
that hospital lynaugh said

the timing couldnt have been better 
talent and technology coincided beautifully at the end of the 19th 
century for controversial artist aubrey beardsley 
though little trained in art and just 25 when he died of 
tuberculosis in 1898 the drawings beardsley made the last six 
years of his life are credited with influencing such giants of 
20thcentury art as pablo picasso paul klee and edvard munch 
beardsleys black and white drawings usually for book or 
magazine illustrations were printed when not suppressed 
through the then new photomechanical reproduction process said 
miriam stewart a curatorial associate at harvard universitys fogg 
art museum the reproductions were faithful to the drawings and 
cost less than those carved into wood blocks by craftsmen rather 
than the artist 
the fogg has more than 50 of the drawings which were donated by 
two alumni they constitute the most important collection of the 
artists work outside great britain said fogg curator of drawings 
william robinson 
for the first time in six years the drawings are on public 
display and for the first time in more than a dozen years they 
are together in one exhibit and since the drawings are on paper 
making them delicate and sensitive to light they can be exhibited 
only briefly museum officials said 
they will be shown at harvards sackler museum through july 9 
together with other material including books illustrated by 
beardsley loaned by harvards houghton library the boston public 
library and bostons museum of fine arts 
some of the drawings are overtly erotic others have touches 
typical of his mischief 
he usually started his drawings with pencil and perfected them 
with ink stewart said in some he used graphite 
his acquaintances included the playwright oscar wilde and 
beardsley became a sensation with his illustrations for wildes 
play salome published in 1894 the illustraions were 
described variously as having nothing to do with the play and 
everything to do with it stewart said 
included in the fogg exhibit are two drawings intended for the 
book but suppressed from publication 
the show also includes work done for a reprint of malorys le 
morte darthur ben johnsons volpone alexander popes the 
rape of the lock aristophanes lysistrata and for the 
periodicals the yellow book and the savoy 
drawings for bonmots a collection of witticisms are sort 
of elaborate doodles some quite grotesque stewart said 
a voracious reader beardsley sometimes exchanged drawings for 
books and it was through this that his career was launched when he 
was chosen to illustrate le morte darthur he was 20 
some drawings resemble posters and advertisements he was of 
his time and he was not trying to create a lyrical past stewart 
said 
beardsley began writing an erotic novel but never completed it 
he became a roman catholic the year before he died and on his 
death bed asked that some of his drawings be destroyed the 
publisher who had them did not 
the foggs collection came from alumni who had different reasons 
for collecting beardsleys work grenville l winthrop who was 
graduated in 1889 and who descended from the first governor of 
massachusetts bequeathed to harvard 23 original beardsley drawings 
among more than 3700 art objects 
scofield thayer class of 1913 and onetime editor and partowner 
of the literary review the dial had more than 30 drawings that 
became the foggs when he died 
winthrop liked the lines and design of beardsleys work thayer 
liked the daring subject matter robinson said

as the spanish tenor jose carreras lay in a 
seattle hospital battling leukemia music helped him to get through 
the ordeal music he says has this spiritual strength 
every day i was listening to music with a walkman in my 
sterilized room one of the pieces i had to hear it every day 
was rachmaninoffs piano concerto no 2 i was listening to many 
versions of it also rachmaninoff playing it himself said 
carreras who gave a recital at carnegie hall on may 25 his first 
appearance in more than two years 
the most important thing for me was to save my life all the 
rest came after this he said 
carreras leukemia is now in remission now im not under any 
kind of treatment i have a routine blood test once a month thats 
all i travel around i play some sports i eat anything drink 
anything there are no limitations in my life 
he makes longrange plans including a coproduction next year 
between several european tv networks on the great opera singer 
enrico caruso 
audiences are delighted as the 42yearold carreras makes his 
comeback recitals 
he performed last july before 150000 in barcelona and also 
appeared in vienna at the vatican and in other european cities 
this spring he was in seattle washington and new york in 
february he recorded saintsaens samson et dalila and since 
has recorded halevys la juive for philips in july hell 
return to opera where he made his fame singing in barcelona in 
cherubinis medea with soprano montserrat caballe 
carreras is ranked as one the top tenors in the world but he 
was often taken to task for vocal roughness believed to be caused 
by singing too often and singing roles too heavy for his voice so 
that he had to press for volume 
before my career was the most important thing in my life 
he said like anybody who succeeds i had to fight a lot and have 
a lot of discipline now im more interested to have the 
opportunity to sing on stage again and communicate with people 
through my voice 
carreras thinks his voice is essentially the same but rested 
i was lying in a hospital for nine months it was a hard period 
but my vocal chords were resting thank god all the therapy and 
treatments and radiation did not affect my vocal chords or mucous 
membranes 
maybe as a singer im a little deeper or more mature there is 
a parallel between the artist and the human being 
he plans to include more lyrical roles in my repertoire as he 
gets back to work what is going to change for sure is the rhythm 
of my career i dont plan to sing more than three or four times in 
one month and to have if possible a month of holiday every year 
im going to enjoy not only my professional life that is what 
i did for 17 years but to enjoy also the human side of my life 
more than before he said carreras has two children alberto 
15 and julia 10 
i dont regret at all that i concentrated so much on my 
profession i had a wonderful life 
carreras who sang the part of tony on the west side story 
record conducted by leonard bernstein made the soundtrack for a 
la boheme film in may 1987 that was when he fell ill 
the diagnosis was acute lymphocytic leukemia his doctors in 
spain recommended that he go to seattles fred hutchinson cancer 
research institute seattle also appealed to carreras because he 
felt he would be less of a media event there than in europe

her lawyer patrica a hurst of the american civil liberties union 
in a case initiated by ms parrillos former husband justin 
parrillo jr a family court judge ruled in 1986 that she may not

state supreme court 
the parrillos were divorced in 1986 and she was given custody of 
the children ages 9 11 and 13 at the time

joseph dipippo once or twice a week caused no harm to the children

dozens of riot police fired tear gas to 
disperse palestinians attending the funeral of a senior plo 
official today and israeli troops reportedly shot dead an arab in 
the occupied gaza strip 
the army said it had no information on the clash in the village 
of beit lahiya where arab doctors said one palestinian was killed 
and two were wounded one seriously 
palestinian reporters said the clash broke out after troops 
tried to reimpose a curfew on the village of 13000 after 
distributing new computerized identity cards to residents arab 
doctors identified the dead man as jamil hafez suleiman 22 and 
said he was shot in the head 
the death raised to 507 the number of palestinians killed in the 
18month uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip twentytwo israelis have also died 
in jerusalem about 2000 mourners waved outlawed palestinian 
flags at the funeral of omar qassem 48 a senior figure in the 
plos democratic front for the liberation of palestine qassem died 
on sunday 
he spent 21 years in israeli jails for his role in a 1968 
guerrilla raid and had become a symbol for palestinians held by 
israel 
israel radio said 20 palestinians were detained following a 
stonethrowing protest that broke out after the funeral which 
included a threehour procession through arab east jerusalem 
reporters at the scene watched police fire tear gas to disperse 
the demonstrators who left the funeral shouting we are the 
fedayeen or guerrillas in arabic 
mourners vowed to increase their opposition to the occupation 
and carried signs sayingescalating the intefadeh will redeem 
omar qassems blood intefadeh is arabic for uprising 
two israeliarab legislators led the procession one of them 
abdel wahab daroushe told the mourners after qassems body was 
lowered into the grave in spite of israels arrogance the 
intefadeh will be victorious 
in the west bank and gaza strip palestinian shop keepers closed 
their doors to mourn qassem 
the army maintained a curfew in the gaza strip for a third 
straight day and began issuing computerized identity cards that 
palestinians will be required to carry to enter israel arabs 
detained for security reasons or convicted of serious crimes will 
be denied the entry permits 
the restrictions are designed to exert economic pressure on 
palestinian activists about 50000 gazans work in israel and 
there is little employment in the coastal strip 
in jerusalem foreign minister moshe arens told 500 american 
jews visiting israel he was surprised the united states would meet 
with plo officials on thursday for a third round of talks since the 
dialogue began in december 
everything the us government does to give the plo status and 
legitimization is counterproductive and cannot possibly help 
israels peace initiative arens said 
also today police said mayor ron nachmann of the jewish west 
bank settlement of ariel apparently did not break the law when he 
ordered arab laborers to wear badges identifying them as alien 
workers 
the police official speaking on condition of anonymity would 
not elaborate the investigation will continue he said 
nachmann backed down after the decision sparked widespread 
criticism and raised comparisons to the yellow stars of david that 
jews were forced to wear in nazi germany

joe drodwill stood in cemetery 
overlooking the sea on tuesday remembering the fellow soldiers who 
fought and died there to free france from nazi tyranny 
its like im reliving the war all over again there are so 
many memories said the war veteran from middletown conn who 
had not been back to the normandy coast since the end of world war 
ii 
about 1000 people gathered by the reflecting pool at the 
american military cemetery at omaha beach on tuesday the 45th 
anniversary of the invasion among them was a large group of 
grayhaired veterans from the united states 
the ceremony at the cemetery was one of several over three days 
by british canadian french and us groups to mark tuesdays 
anniversary at bayeux queen mother elizabeth of britain dedicated 
a stainedglass window in the cathedral in honor of the fallen 
soldiers 
canadian veterans affairs minister gerald s merrithew joined in 
commemorations at the canadian cemetery at beny sur mer 
drodwill was in a group of 225 us army rangers who just after 
dawn on june 6 1944 scaled the 9story high cliff at point du hoc 
on omaha beach using grappling hooks and ladders to reach the big 
german guns above 
nazi soldiers fired straight down on them cutting the ropes to 
send many rangers plummeting to their deaths 
i couldnt sleep last night i kept thinking of the beach 
said drodwill who lost four men under his command during the 
assault 
surrounded by a group of veteran rangers drodwill cried softly 
as a single bugle played taps the melancholy notes lofting over 
the manicured green lawn lined with 9368 white marble crosses 
the sun emerged and warmed the crowd damp from standing in 
heavy morning showers a military band played the star spangled 
banner and the marseillaise 
four f16s flew low over the sparkling english channel and the 
cemetery that overlooks a long curving beach where american troops 
stormed ashore to drive back german forces in what was the 
beginning of the end of adolf hitlers tyranny 
the germans in trenches and concrete bunkers perched on the 
bluff 150 feet above the beach shot at the wideopen yanks as they 
struggled onto the beach stumbling kneedeep hipdeep neckdeep 
through the surf some of them shot to death before ever touching 
shore 
i lost one in the water said drodwill 68 he went down 
under the weight of his gear and never came up 
the dead and wounded were sprawled everywhere their blood 
soaking into the sand 
some of my men fell but there were so many others all around 
me all americans all young thats the picture in my head i cant 
get rid of drodwill said 
up and down a 50mile stretch of normandy coast 180000 us 
british and canadian soldiers battled on utah gold juno and sword 
beaches in operation overlord the largest amphibious operation in 
history 
with reinforcements the assault force numbered 3 million men 
compared to the relatively light american casualties at utah 
omaha was the roughest of the fighting it took all day for the 1st 
and 29th infantry divisions to cross 250 yards of sand and rock and 
climb onto the bluff where the 172acre military cemetery now 
stands as a memorial to those who fought and died 
i dont usually cry drodwill said maybe this trip will 
help soften the memory

president bush amid praise for pakistani 
prime minister benazir bhuttos efforts to aid the afghan 
resistance pledged today to join her in exploring any serious 
avenue to a political solution to the bloody conflict in 
afghanistan 
prime minister bhutto and i reviewed the situation in 
afghanistan we agreed that the job is not done bush 
said of the afghan rebels struggle to topple the marxist regime in 
kabul 
the two leaders met for an hour with the afghan situation the 
centerpiece of their discussions 
although many us officials had expected the sovietbacked 
kabul regime to fall shortly after the withdrawl of red army troops 
in february the rebel forces have been unable to topple the regime 
of najibullah that has forced the administration to reconsider its 
strategy in the troubled region 
pakistan the third largest recipient of us aid has 
cooperated closely with the united states in aiding the afghan 
rebel effort to topple the kabul government 
bush said he and mrs bhutto had discussed ways to encourage a 
political solution in afghanistan that will lead to a nonaligned 
representative government to replace the illegitimate regime in 
kabul 
the united states and pakistan will continue to explore any 
serious avenue towards this end 
mrs bhutto in her departure remarks called her talks with 
bush instructive and fruitful adding in regards to the afghan 
situation we are in complete accord with future policies 
pakistan remains fully committed ot a politcal solution in 
afghanistan she said 
earlier the two leaders exchanged warm remarks during the 
formal welcoming ceremony held under leaden grey skies on the 
south lawn of the white house 
bush pledged to chart new ways to strengthen old bonds with 
pakistan greeting mrs bhutto as the living symbol of the renewal 
of democracy in her strategic nation 
the day of the dictator is over declared mrs bhutto 
the president noted that they are both new in their posts 
let us craft new ideas new initiative to meet the challeges 
of a changing world bush said 
he described mrs bhutto as a living symmbol of those who risk 
all and sacrifice much so that others might know democracy and 
freedom 
attired in a traditional white shawl tunic and pants the prime 
minister replied that she came to washington to begin discussions 
of a new relationship as both nations work to meet the new 
challenges that confront us in the closing but complex phase of 
the afghan war 
the washington post reported today that the bush administration 
is considering the sale of 60 f16 fighter jets to pakistan at a 
cost of 14 billion but the two leaders made no mention of any 
such agreement in their welcoming remarks 
while bush did not mention the ongoing afghan rebel effort in 
his initial remarks he repeatedly praised mrs bhuttos battle to 
return her nation to democratic rule she assumed her duties six 
months ago following her partys victory in national elections 
mrs bhutto said the two nations have stood together as 
partners in the attempt to restore freedom and independence to 
afghanistan 
our countries have developed a vital security relationship and 
a major program of economic cooperation this has enabled pakkistan 
to work with confidence for peace in our region she said 
it was not so long ago that pakistan was a dictatorship and i 
was in prison but as you said mr president giving heart to all 
those living under tyrany the day of the dictator is over she 
said 
after the welcoming ceremony and a meeting in the oval office 
mrs bhutto was to be the guest of honor at a state department 
luncheon hosted by secretary of state james a baker iii 
a white house state dinner was planned this evening following 
meetings mrs bhutto had scheduled at the world bank and 
international monetary fund 
during her twoday stay agreements in the areas of narcotics 
control housing and education are to be signed also on the agenda 
is the us aid program for pakistan for which the administration 
has requested 380 million in economic assistance and 240 million 
in military transfers for the next fiscal year pakistan is the 
third largest recipient of us aid 
but the principal focus of attention of her visit will be the 
unending civil war in afghanistan a conflict in which the united 
states and pakistan have cooperated for years 
although the soviet union completed the withdrawal of its forces 
in february pakistan is still bearing the burden of 3 million 
afghan refugees as fighting continues between the marxist 
government in kabul and the afghan rebels the insurgents have been 
using pakistan as a launching pad for attacks inside afghanistan 
in recent interviews mrs bhutto has indicated a desire for a 
political settlement but she accepts the us view that any such 
agreement should not include afghanistans current leader 
najibullah whose forces have proved remarkably resilient in the 
face of predictions his government would collapse following the 
soviet withdrawal pakistan

david duke exku klux klan leader 
turned ambitious freshman legislator riled some people with his 
election but during his first regular lawmaking session he has 
hardly made a dent in louisiana government 
with the 1989 general session nearing its end none of his bills 
has made it through the legislative process only one was passed by 
the house and it is pending in a senate committee 
some of my legislations gone through i mean im only a 
twomonth freshman legislator and i think ive done quite well 
duke said 
its not unusual for a newcomer to have difficulty getting 
legislation passed rep james st raymond had a similar experience 
last year 
the major difference is david is sort of a oneissue type of 
guy hes interested in the racial issue st raymond said 
the legislative session could end as early as this weekend 
duke 38 was elected in february to represent a nearly 
allwhite district in suburban new orleans after a notax 
campaign that focused on civil rights for everyone including 
whites 
duke is a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan which he left 
in 1980 in a dispute with a rival faction he then formed the 
national association for the advancement of white people which he 
still heads 
he ran for president in 1988 first as a democrat and then on 
the populist party ticket he registered as a republican days 
before entering the house race which he won by 227 votes in a 
runoff with a longtime republican who was endorsed by president 
bush and former president reagan 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater called for 
dukes censure as a charlatan after the election 
a challenge to his seating in the legislature fizzled when 69 of 
102 lawmakers backed him several representatives said they were 
inundated with calls from constituents across the state insisting 
that duke be seated 
when the regular session began in april duke offered nine bills 
which would among other things have eliminated affirmative action 
and minority set asides and required drug testing for housing 
project residents and welfare recipients 
one duke bill is dead on the house floor one is pending in a 
senate committee a third was gutted in committee and sent to the 
house floor where it was shelved six languish in house committees 
and are not expected to get out 
seated at one end of the back row of desks duke is not one of 
the plentiful lower chamber gadflies he rarely goes to the 
microphone to speak on others bills 
dukes legislation seems to be a target for procedural 
torpedoes including one fired by rep mitch landrieu a young 
white legislator whose district includes a housing project 
landrieu got the house to table dukes bill to scrap affirmative 
action laws 
it was a short house and they just happened to get two switch 
votes which made a difference on that particular vote duke said 
what mitch landrieu did is he robbed the people of the right to 
hear the points of view and really have equal rights on this 
matter we must have equal rights in this state for everybody 
another duke bill to deny welfare benefits to drug users by 
requiring them to be tested was weakened in a house committee to 
affect only welfare recipients convicted of drug crimes it is 
awaiting debate by the full house 
the bill in the senate committee would require teenagers to 
pass drug tests to get drivers licenses but it was gutted by 
amendments offered by a black legislator rep cd jones 
its a unique situation hes sort of an internationally known 
fellow and that puts added pressure on him to get a lot 
accomplished st raymond said i told him he could work within 
the republican caucus well give you a chance or you can go off 
and set your agenda hes kind of gone off on his own 
but duke said he believes his presence has made a difference 
i think ive pushed the whole house of representatives more to 
the issues of the middle class and more to the issues of my agenda 
my campaign agenda which is equal rights for all and reform of the 
welfare system duke said i think were moving along quite 
well

the agriculture department was asked tuesday 
to investigate a grain company with possible ties to a fugitive 
businessman in switzerland and whether the business had properly 
received 65 million in export subsidies 
the chairman of a house agriculture subcommittee rep dan 
glickman dkan called for the review of richco grain a 
swissbased company with an office in stamford conn and payments 
it received through the export enhancement program 
glickman said usda needs to focus on the companys connections 
to marc rich who renounced his us citizenship and fled to 
switzerland in 1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion 
racketeering mail and wire fraud 
while i am disturbed that a company whose main operations lie 
outside of the united states can establish but a nominal onshore 
presence and qualify to receive eep bonuses as appears to be the 
case with richco grain i am truly shocked that a fugitive from 
us justice can benefit from a program funded by taxpayer 
dollars glickman said in a letter to agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter 
under the export enhancement program or eep private exporters 
can sell us commodities at lower prices to meet foreign 
competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or 
other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
richard crowder under secretary for international affairs and 
commodity programs said he had not seen the congressmans letter 
but that usda had already started checking through what the 
connections are between richco and rich he said the review was 
started to answer questions raised by glickman about richco at a 
subcommittee hearing in april 
an official of richco al church declined comment about the 
usda review and would not provide any information about the company 
glickman in his letter said an unmistakable line of 
ownership control and profit runs from richco grain to rich 
through a series of subsidiary arrangements 
he asked that usdas inspector general determine whether richco 
had qualified for the export subsidy program and whether department 
eligibility guidelines need to be changed to close any possible 
loopholes used by richco 
i believe that especially in this case the department should 
take special care to determine whether richs benefit from the eep 
program through richco grain was camouflaged through subsidiary 
arrangements with other business entities he owns and controls 
glickman wrote in short has rich and richco grain complied with 
the letter of the law but flouted its spirit 
richco has the same telephone number as clarendon ag a us 
subsidiary of marc rich amp co ag of switzerland the two 
companies settled a federal tax evasion case in 1984 by pleading 
guilty and agreeing to pay more than 200 million in back taxes 
fines and other penalties 
criminal charges against rich were unaffected by the settlement 
the government alleged that rich and his commoditytrading empire 
cheated the us treasury out of millions of dollars in taxes 
through a series of illegal oil transactions among richcontrolled 
companies 
according to glickman richco has received about 65 million 
worth of subsidies through eep including about 250000 for a 
recent wheat sale to the soviet union 
last month president bush approved use of the subsidy program 
for the sale of 15 million tons of wheat to the soviets richco 
handled at least 30000 tons of the initial part of the wheat deal 
subsidies averaged 846 per ton for richco and four other 
companies according to usda

solidarity said today that despite its 
overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections it will not accept 
the communist partys offer to join a governing coalition 
in a conciliatory move however the free trade union movement 
offered to stand by the agreement made with authorities in april 
and allow the party the twothirds majority in parliaments 
powerful lower house 
up to 35 of those seats may be vacant because high party and 
government officials such as prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski 
appeared to have been defeated in sundays vote despite running 
unopposed 
rakowski will offer his resignation and that of his cabinet when 
the new parliament convenes in june said deputy government 
spokesman zbyslaw rykowski 
voters disgruntled by the communists more than 40 years of 
authoritarian rule and mismanagement of the economy gave few of the 
highranking officials the majority needed to gain seats 
solidarity won an overwhelming majority of seats to the new 
100member senate and virtually all the 161 seats it was permitted 
in the lower house or sejm according to unofficial returns a 
handful of seats may be decided in runoffs on june 18 
on monday the party conceded defeat in what was polands most 
democratic balloting in more than four decades but fears were 
raised that the outcome could precipitate a new political crisis 
the result gave an opposition group in eastern europe control of a 
freely chosen chamber of parliament for the first time since the 
postwar communist takeover 
the communists have urged solidarity to join a governing 
coalition an arrangement unprecedented in the soviet bloc 
we cannot do reforms by ourselves we need each other 
rykowski said today 
he declined to be specific saying such questions would have to 
wait until the new parliament is seated 
at a news conference today solidarity spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz said the union considers itself bound by the april 
accords in which it agreed to give the government a majority in the 
460member sejm 299 seats 
authorities should thus be allowed to fill the vacant seats as 
they please he said 
onyszkiewicz ruled out a formal governing coalition all 
candidates for deputy and senator stated that they will enter the 
sejm or senate as the opposition that was made very clear 
but he said that did not rule out future joint actions and 
joint decisions to solve specific problems 
senior solidarity adviser bronislaw geremek told reporters the 
union was ready to act jointly with the government to work for 
reform 
onyszkiewicz praised mondays statement by communist party 
spokesman jan bisztyga who acknowledged the partys electoral 
defeat 
it was a very important statement because it shows that the 
government and the party are committed to a peaceful transition 
from the present political situation to a more democratic 
situation he said 
solidarity wants totally free elections in four years without 
any prereserved seats for either side 
jubilant union supporters celebrated their election win with 
russian champagne into the night monday at warsaw campaign 
headquarters 
although final official results were not expected until midweek 
voters rejected governmentbacked candidates nearly everywhere 
polands leader gen wojciech jaruzelski on friday suggested a 
postelection grand coalition though no specific explanations 
have been given of what he intended 
solidaritys victory was shocking in its proportions for the 
authorities 
leading officials likely failing to win the necessary votes for 
a seat in parliament include interior minister czeslaw kiszczak and 
eight of the ruling politburos 17 members including no 2 jozef 
czyrek 
though rejected the government officials are allowed to keep 
their posts in his dramatic concession of defeat monday bisztyga 
acknowledged on television a decided majority for solidarity 
and appealed for calm 
with or without a formal coalition of solidarity and the 
communist leadership that long sought to crush it it appeared 
certain the two would have to cooperate 
the government needs solidarity if it is to end a protracted 
economic crisis that includes 80 percent inflation that last year 
touched off a series of crippling strikes the country has a 39 
billion foreign debt 
the solidaritycontrolled senate will have veto power over all 
legislation and could only be overridden by a twothirds majority 
in the sejm 
but with at best a 65 percent majority of the sejm seats the 
communist party and its allies would need at least 10 solidarity 
votes in the lower house to override a veto

a new york city art dealer testified today 
that peg goldberg left no stone unturned in her attempt last 
summer to learn whether four sixthcentury christian mosaics 
offered for sale were stolen 
i think her inquiry met the best professional standards 
said andre emmerich owner of andre emmerich gallery 
goldbergs ownership of the mosaics is being challenged by the 
republic of cyprus and its greek orthodox church who claim the 
works were stolen from a church in northern cyprus and smuggled out 
of the mediterranean island nation 
they are asking a federal judge to order the suburban 
indianapolis dealer to return the mosaics 
on monday goldberg testified she believed the man who sold her 
the four mosaics obtained them legally she also said she made 
inquiries around the world to see if any claims had been made 
against the art 
emmerich a witness for goldberg said in a videotaped 
deposition that comparing her with international dealers would be 
like comparing the corner store to bloomingdales but he said 
her investigation of the mosaics before she purchased them was as 
complete as any moreexperienced dealer would have made 
i couldnt have expected more she left no stone unturned 
he said 
he said the international foundation for art research which 
goldberg contacted by telephone is considered the most complete 
and readily available source on stolen artwork 
the mosaics which are believed to date to 525 ad depict 
jesus christ as an adolescent the apostles james and matthew and 
an archangel they are among only a handful of icons surviving from 
the first centuries of christianity 
goldberg on monday testified she believed aydin dikmen who sold 
her the mosaics had been an archaeologist for the turkish republic 
of northern cyprus she said she did not know the breakaway 
government is not recognized by the united states 
she said she was told that in the process of his other duties 
he had found these pieces that he had been able to make 
application to acquire them and that had subsequently been granted 
by the government 
goldberg testified she called customs officials in the united 
states switzerland germany and turkey and found no claims against 
the mosaics 
she said she also called unesco in switzerland and the 
international foundation for art research which keeps an inventory 
of stolen art 
she did not ask unesco if the mosaics were stolen only whether 
any treaties would prevent her from bringing them to the united 
states and was told no she testified 
goldberg said she asked the art foundation whether it had any 
record of the mosaics being reported stolen and was told no 
unesco and several other international art groups did have 
reports that the mosaics were stolen 
on crossexamination by attorney thomas r kline goldberg said 
she could not recall the names of the people she talked to

a scientific test that has found growing 
use in court to identify crime suspects through genetic patterns in 
body cells will be challenged this week in the appeal of a man who 
faces four death sentences 
timothy w spencer 26 a former resident of a richmond halfway 
house was the first defendant in a serialmurder case in the 
nation to be confronted with socalled dna fingerprinting 
evidence at his trials 
dna deoxyribonucleic acid is the basic genetic material found 
in each cell of the human body and forms the blueprint for each 
individual everyones dna pattern is believed to be unique with 
the exception of identical twins 
spencer was convicted and sentenced to death in separate trials 
last year for the rapemurders of susan m tucker 44 of 
arlington and debbie dudley davis 35 of richmond 
this year he was convicted and sentenced to die in two other 
cases the rapemurders of dr susan elizabeth hellams 32 of 
richmond and diane cho 15 of chesterfield county 
all four victims were bound and strangled by an assailant who 
broke into their homes through a window 
in each case dna from a sample of semen found at the crime 
scene was compared to dna patterns in spencers blood cells the 
results linked him to the murders 
the genetic evidence was challenged by defense lawyers at 
spencers trials but the judges allowed the test results in each 
case 
although the dna test developed in england is relatively new 
bert rohrer a spokesman for attorney general mary sue terry said 
courts are likely to uphold such a test if it is determined to be 
reliable 
at spencers trial for the davis murder experts testified that 
the dna patterns found in the defendants blood and in the semen 
sample found with the victim matched the odds of finding such a 
match randomly was one in 705 million they testified 
but jeffery l everhart a richmond attorney who represented 
spencer in the davis killing argued that the dna procedure is too 
unproved to be relied upon exclusively as it was in that and the 
other cases to put the defendant at the scene of the crime 
defense lawyers argued that the procedures reliability may come 
into question in future research on forensic evidence 
on thursday the virginia supreme court will hear challenges to 
the dna evidence and other issues that arose in spencers trials 
for the tucker and davis murders 
the appeals went to the high court on automatic review a 
standard procedure when anyone is sentenced to execution in 
virginia spencers appeals in the hellams and cho murders will be 
heard later 
spencer also was linked to a fifth murder but arlington county 
commonwealths attorney helen fahey said spencer would not be 
charged in that slaying because dna testing of the aging evidence 
was inconclusive 
another man david vasquez was sentenced to a 35year prison 
term for that killing after pleading guilty to firstdegree murder 
but was pardoned by gov gerald l baliles when new evidence came 
to light

the navy has canceled plans for an 
amphibious assault on a duluth beach during a goodwill recruiting 
visit this summer because of protests by peace activists city 
council members and others 
opponents had threatened to meet the marine landing force on the 
beach with an army of protesters 
however the navy said it hasnt canceled mock landings at five 
other great lakes cities as part of a 21city great lakes 
recruiting tour as far as i know duluth is the only place in 
the great lakes where weve met opposition said navy chief petty 
officer steven fiebing 
he said the uss boulder still will dock in duluth on july 21 so 
people can tour the ship 
i spent a horrible weekend watching the news from china its 
nice to know we can communicate with our military said city 
council president joyce benson 
not everyone was happy 
there was more opposition to this than the invasion of 
grenada said dan russell head of the duluth convention and 
visitors bureau which helped organize the event he said the 
landing would have been a great opportunity for us to sell the 
fact that duluth has seven miles of beautiful beach 
original plans called for 200 marines in amphibious tanks to 
storm ashore and capture a beach house on minnesota point a 
narrow strip of land that separates duluth harbor and superior bay 
from lake superior 
but at least a dozen religious and peace groups said such an 
exercise glorified violence and war and was not an appropriate way 
to recruit the citys young people and they planned a group of 
protesters to defend the beach 
the navy said it was not swayed but relented after benson 
telephoned some top navy officials and council member frank jewell 
threatened to introduce a resolution opposing the use of the beach 
for the landing 
the resolution would say there are a number of ordinances that 
prohibit such things as the use of firearms or motorized vehicles 
from the beach said jewell 
they probably just assumed a permit wouldnt be necessary the 
military usually doesnt apply for a permit to storm beaches 
russell said 
other cities where amphibious landings are scheduled are 
cleveland michigan city ind lorain ohio erie pa and 
rochester ny

democratic gov rose mofford vetoed a 32 
billion budget from the republicancontrolled legislature and 
demanded that democrats get a greater say 
the veto unprecedented in state history came monday on the 
148th day of what was supposed to be a 100day session and left the 
state without a spending plan for the fiscal year that begins july 
1 
republican legislative leaders agreed to meet with democrats and 
said they would suspend most other business for the week 
conservative lawmakers said the veto might backfire on mrs 
mofford if it prompted them to reopen budgets for agencies for 
which she already had gotten what she wanted 
in a radio address mrs mofford said the gop plan was at least 
165 million out of balance does not meet or adequately fund our 
moral and legal obligations and undermines the economic future 
of the state by defaulting on investments that need to be made 
the budget was put together on an exclusively partisan basis 
with the 90member legislatures 39 democrats left on the 
sidelines she said 
mrs moffords spending proposal calls for 86 million to 116 
million more in overall spending than the gop plan and puts 
different amounts of money into some areas 
mrs moffords budget seeks about 40 million for employee pay 
raises while the legislature wants to spend 178 million for 
example and it proposes 22 million more in welfare agency 
spending than the gop plan 
the gop plan represents an 11 percent increase over this years 
spending some republicans criticized mrs mofford for vetoing the 
full budget instead of just the items she objected to adding that 
she had not played a major role in budget talks apart from putting 
out an official proposal in january as part of her state of the 
state message 
she reminds me of groundhog day said sen leo corbet she 
came out and gave the state of the state and saw her shadow and we 
havent seen her since 
no other governor in arizonas history has vetoed a full budget 
according to the house clerks office 
i think of all of the options the governor had available to 
her she selected the worst one said senate majority leader john 
mawhinney 
if the governor was unhappy with either the revenue package or 
the budget then what we needed was clear indication of what it is 
that she felt she couldnt live with he added

banking groups lined up tuesday to oppose 
legislation that would require financial institutions to cash 
government checks for noncustomers and offer lowcost savings or 
checking accounts 
the bankers told the senate banking subcommittee on consumer and 
regulatory affairs that banks have been doing a good job of 
voluntarily meeting the needs of the poor and elderly and should 
not have new government requirements imposed on them as proposed by 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
how can it make sense for washington to mandate one rigid 
approach which is supposed to meet the needs of all our diverse 
communities asked american bankers association representative 
robert l stevens president of the bryn mawr trust co in 
pennsylvania 
but officials of organizations representing consumers and the 
elderly told the panel that financial institutions ought to be 
ashamed to argue against government involvement at a time when 
congress is considering a 300 billion rescue of the savings and 
loan industry 
banking lobbyists have often stated that the banking industry 
is a private enterprise and should not be looked on as having to 
fill any given public purpose said peggy miller of the consumer 
federation of america such an assumption made in the face of the 
astronomical costs to the public of the sampl bailout is 
indefensible 
metzenbaum had originally tried to enact his proposals by 
attaching them to the sampl bailout bill passed by the senate april 
19 but he backed off after sen alan j dixon dill chairman of 
the subcommittee promised him a hearing 
dixon said he was keeping an open mind on the proposals and 
would decide in a month or so whether to begin moving them 
through the legislative process 
one of metzenbaums bills would require banks and sampls to cash 
government checks such as welfare and social security payments of 
up to 1500 for noncustomers with proper identification the 
institutions would be permitted to cover their costs through a low 
fee set by the federal reserve 
the second measure would require financial institutions to offer 
lowcost accounts with a minimum balance of 25 and a maximum 
balance of 1000 the institutions would have to provide monthly 
statements and permit up to 10 checks or withdrawals a month 
this is not drastic or draconian legislation its a very 
modest proposal he said 
however banking groups complained they would suffer losses from 
fraud if denied the right to refuse to cash a check 
the aba said a survey showed that more than half of all banks 
and threequarters of large banks already offer lowcost basic 
accounts and 80 percent cash government checks for noncustomers 
as an alternative to mandated checkcashing the bankers advocated 
expanding government programs to directly deposit checks into bank 
accounts 
but consumer groups and the american association of retired 
persons said lowincome people often cant afford bank accounts and 
are forced to rely on expensive checkcashing services also the 
aarp said many elderly people were suspicious of direct deposits 
believing their money could be misdirected 
miller said the industrys claim that more than half of all 
banks offer lowcost accounts is flawed because they too broadly 
define lowcost she said only one in four banks offers checking 
accounts with a 3 or less monthly fee 
the senate panel is holding another hearing wednesday on a third 
metzenbaum proposal that would require banks and sampls to make 
public their record of serving poor and minority neighborhoods 
other banking groups opposing metzenbaum are the independent 
bankers association of america and the consumer bankers association

jim wright sat alone over a draft of his 
resignation speech while nearby in the capitol house majority 
leader tom foley hosted a breakfast meeting with bush 
administration budget officers 
all around him last week ambitious democrats were scrambling 
for support in house leadership races but not foley i was not 
going to campaign for an office for which there was no vacancy 
he would say later 
tuesday just after noon the man from spokane wash filled 
the vacancy wright was out as speaker of the house foley was in 
throughout the turmoil over wrights political demise foley 
went out of his way to conduct business as usual budget meetings 
funerals a ride down main street he kept to a normal schedule 
during an extraordinary week 
it was a very very wrenching time he says now i would 
have hoped if i had a chance to become speaker it would have 
happened through the normal succession 
his activities during this unusual succession may provide a hint 
of his leadership style in the house publicly foley worked to 
keep the house moving on a legislative agenda that slipped badly 
over the past several months privately he played a quiet 
behindthescenes role in the tumultuous events 
some democrats urged foley 60 years old and a 25year veteran 
of the house to distance himself from the wounded speaker he 
refused telling a reporter i believe strongly in political 
loyalty 
it hasnt been that difficult to stick with wright he 
added in fact political observers would have been astonished to 
see foley add to wrights difficulties instead he seemed to 
bolster the beleaguered speaker by working to keep the house in 
motion 
foley kept one eye on the politics of succession one eye on 
legislation 
he invited budget director richard darman and others over for 
breakfast over scrambled eggs and bacon served in the elegant 
majority leaders dining room the session revolved around the nuts 
and bolts of a budget 
foley flew to seattle for former sen warren magnusons funeral 
and then went on to his eastern washington district with a growing 
entourage of reporters he tended to local matters and took time 
for a ride in an old chevy convertible down the main street of 
oakesdale about as far away from the capitol as a politician can 
get in both distance attitude and spirit 
even there foley was unable to escape from the political 
firestorm building in the other washington foley had been 
surprised two days before by the news that democratic whip tony 
coelho following a barrage of reports about his junk bond 
investments was going to resign 
late in the day came a cbs report that said the justice 
department was investigating the personnel practices of rep 
william gray dpa the man who heads the democratic caucus in the 
house 
i want to believe and i hope there was no plan to attempt 
political intervention by the justice department in the coelho 
and gray cases foley said 
in private back at the capitol trusted by both sides he played 
a quiet role in illfated negotiations that would have brought 
wrights immediate resignation in exchange for dismissal of some 
charges by the house ethics committee 
he had been wrights occasional confidant as well 
twice during recent months wright indicated he was thinking of 
stepping down at the end of his term and told foley he should 
prepare to become speaker both times foley urged wright to avoid 
any precipitous decisions 
foley and wright met last tuesday morning ostensibly to discuss 
the weeks legislative agenda but the speaker broached the subject 
of resignation and again made clear he wanted to lay his case 
before the country and congress and also wanted a permanent record 
in the annals of the house 
wednesday began with the budget summit but within hours wright 
told foley he intended to make a speech on the house floor a 
signal he was going to resign 
a flurry of meetings in foleys office followed including one 
with rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the ethics committee 
foley spent the next several hours on the house floor in the 
process he informed republican leader bob michel of the speakers 
decision wright asked foley to preside over the house and it was 
foley who recognized the speaker for his hourlong resignation 
speech 
afterward foley quickly was on the phone asking colleagues for 
support now that he could make an open bid for the speakership 
there were no other contenders but he said he had learned from 
former speaker thomas tip oneill not to take anything or 
anyone for granted 
people like to be asked for their support oneonone he 
said

jesse jackson asked democratic senators 
tuesday to create a domestic world bank which would make loans for 
housing and small businesses and generate revenue for government 
services 
jackson a former presidential candidate spoke at a private 
meeting of about 20 democrats on investment plan which would make 
heavy use of pension funds but require no tax money 
the bank would get its pool of capital from 10 percent of the 
800 billion in public pension funds and money that private pension 
programs would be willing to invest jackson told reporters 
the program would be administered by a board of labor 
management and government representatives 
he said the bank would make governmentsecured loans which could 
begin to build affordable housing economically integrated 
housing small and mediumsized businesses the loans would 
generate revenue which of course pays taxes for a health plan 
and for police and fire services and for education he said 
jackson said the senators exhibited a great degree of 
optimism adding that sens daniel patrick moynihan dny and 
joseph lieberman dconn promised to conduct hearings on the idea 
the investment plan is needed jackson said because the budget 
deficit prohibits substantial investment in rural and urban 
america and banks and insurance companies with redlining would 
not invest in urban or rural america 
the democratic party is at a point to take the offensive 
to take the lead jackson said right now the headlines are 
dominated by the leadership changes on the house side and focused 
on personal ethics there is no focus on the ethical challenge to 
rebuild america

faced with a chaotic situation the us 
government is encouraging all americans in beijing to leave the 
chinese capital and is arranging for added flights out of the 
country the state department announced today 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler described the climate as tense 
and unsettled but said there were no known threats against 
american residents tourists or diplomats an estimated 1400 
americans are in beijing and 8800 in china overall 
persons in other parts of china may also wish to leave china 
depending on the local situation ms tutwiler said citizens 
who chose to leave should if possible avoid routes out of the 
country that would require them to travel through beijing 
the spokeswoman said arrangements were being made with united 
and northwest airlines to supplement their regular service from 
china with charter flights beijing airport was reported open 
for the first time meanwhile the state department acknowledged 
there may be dissension within the ranks of the chinese armed 
forces 
we have reason to believe that all elements of the army do not 
support what is taking place ms tutwiler said we have no 
firm evidence of armed clashes 
troops opened fire on sunday on students in tiananmen square 
killing hundreds of the young demonstrators who were demanding 
democratic reforms in the worlds largest marxist country 
ms tutwiler also announced that all chinese in the united 
states would be allowed to remain indefinitely because of the 
situation at home she said president bush made the move as a 
compassionate gesture 
sources said telephone calls were being made systematically to 
all american residents of beijing who had been asked earlier to 
make the embassy aware of their whereabouts 
the state department on monday urged american students in china 
to stay away from campuses and to remain in touch with the us 
embassy the department also renewed its advisory urging americans 
against travel to china 
the chinese capital was threatened with civil war as armies 
loyal to rival political factions were reported battling for 
control of the city 
president bush said monday the world must stand with the 
chinese demonstrator who in a singular act of defiance captured by 
television placed himself in front of a column of tanks rolling 
through beijing 
i think that image is going to be with us for a long time 
bush said and all i can say to him wherever he might be and to 
the people around the world is we are and we must stand with 
him 
crafting a course influenced by his firsthand experience in 
china bush suspended more than 600 million in us arms sales to 
china but stopped short of advocating economic sanctions 
i reserve the right to take a whole new look at things if the 
violence escalates bush said but for now he is sticking with 
the arms move and suspending visits between us and chinese 
military leaders 
bush made the announcement applauded by congressional leaders 
at a news conference but later discussed the china situation 
again emotionally during a speech before the business roundtable 
the president met today with the leader of another asian power 
pakistan pledging to join prime minister benazir bhutto in 
exploring any serious avenue to a political solution to the 
bloody conflict in afghanistan 
prime minister bhutto and i reviewed the situation in 
afghanistan we agreed that the job is not done bush 
said of the afghan rebels struggle to topple the marxist regime in 
kabul 
pakistan remains fully committed to a politcal solution in 
afghanistan mrs bhutto said following a meeting with bush at the 
white house 
in his remarks monday night to business leaders bush said he 
was haunted by the sight played frequently through the day on 
television of a demonstrator who stood alone in front of tanks 
advancing through beijing 
i was so moved by the bravery of that individual what is 
it that gives a young man strength gives him the courage to stand 
up in front of a column of tanks right there in front of the 
world 
bush told the business leaders they should continue to seek 
trade with china claiming he preferred military sanctions against 
china rather than economic ones 
earlier he told reporters i dont want to hurt the chinese 
people he rejected out of hand the idea of recalling the us 
ambassador 
that would be 180 degrees wrong said bush who was himself 
the us envoy in china in 197475 our ambassador provides one 
of the best listening posts we have in china 
i am trying to take steps that will encourage a peaceful 
change and yet recognize the fact that china does have great pride 
in its own history he said 
leaders of congress who visited the white house for a foreign 
policy review with the president including a firsthand report on 
his triumphs at last weeks nato summit in brussels emerged with 
strong praise for the course bush has set 
i think hes done the right thing said house majority 
leader thomas s foley dwash after the bipartisan session 
bush also made clear both at his news conference and in an 
unusual oval office meeting the depth of what he called the 
great admiration in my heart for the students who have 
demonstrated and now died for democracy in beijing 
bush also said he would give sympathetic review to visa 
extensions for any of the 40000 chinese students studying in the 
united states who were afraid of returning home 
the white house hastily invited four prodemocracy chinese 
graduate students and activists from local universities to meet 
with bush 
the president looked on approvingly as jia hao 38 a phd 
candidate in political science at george washington university 
applauded bushs actions saying they will be a great support 
spiritually and physically to the people who are fighting for the 
freedom and democracy 
bush condemned the assault as a violent and bloody attack on 
demonstrators who were advocating basic human rights 
bush said halting arms sales is going to send a strong signal 
im not saying its going to cure the shortrange problem in china 
but i think it is very important the chinese leaders know its 
not going to be business as usual 
white house officials said that over 600 million in continuing 
military sles to china would be affected including a 502 million 
program to help the chinese upgrade electronic and navigational 
equipment on their f8 fighter jets 
other projects affected are the final two units in a 625 
million sale of four artillerylocating radars a 285 million 
program for upgrading largecalibre ammunition production and an 
85 million sale of antisubmarine torpedos 
the united states has sold more than 700 million in arms to 
china since 1979

after the death of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini iran moves into what is arguably the islamic revolutions 
most decisive phase as rival factions jockey for power 
some analysts and iranian opposition figures in exile predict 
that iran will be gripped by another bloody paroxysm as khomeinis 
heirs battle for supremacy 
however most believe the transition could take many months of 
bitter but largely peaceful maneuvering 
the swift action sunday by the 83member assembly of experts 
formed in 1979 to ensure the smooth transition of power in naming 
president ali khamenei as caretaker ruler appears to have contained 
an open struggle for power for the time being 
but it has not eliminated it the countrys political future is 
more uncertain now than at any period since shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi was toppled in 1979 and khomeini returned in triumph from 
exile to found the theocratic islamic republic 
in its 10 turbulent years the republic has endured the 
hostility of much of the world bloody internal schisms a grueling 
war with iraq and the humiliation of having to accept a ceasefire 
after a string of battlefield disasters 
but surviving khomeinis death and settling the succession issue 
will be the revolutions most strenuous test 
even as khomeini was being buried amid scenes of mass anguish 
the men he installed in power were lining up against other 
one one side are the socalled pragmatists led by parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani and khamenei they favor a collective 
leadership opening doors to the west and tackling the urgent task 
of postwar reconstruction 
on the other are the antiwestern radicals under interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi who believe the revolutions 
survival depends on irans preeminence in the moslem world and who 
seek the spread of khomeinis fundamentalism 
opposition groups in exile including monarchists led by the 
shahs son and heavily armed rebels based in iraq have largely 
been sidelined and their rhetoric apart few see them as contenders 
in the power struggle 
some analysts believe that iran will move toward a less rigid 
religiousbased system downgrading the theocracy that has played 
such a dominant role since khomeini was catapulted to power 
khamanei a hojatoleslam or middleranking cleric clearly has 
not inherited khomeinis undisputed spiritual authority 
since his appointment irans official media has accorded him 
the courtesy title of ayatollah 
but it has not referred to him as imam or spiritual leader 
as khomeini was universally known throughout iran 
no one can command kohmeinis authority said shahram 
chubin an iran analyst with genevas graduate institute of 
international affairs theres a gap and its got to be filled 
theres movement toward a more secular system he said in a 
telephone interview 
khomeini died before he could oversee the settlement of the 
leadership question 
that will likely be resolved aug 18 when constitutional 
changes formulated by a 20man committee khomeini appointed in 
april will be put to the nation in a referendum held at the same 
time as presidential elections 
the constitutional amendments aimed at eliminating competing 
centers of power which khomeini described as flaws and 
imperfections will have a farreaching impact 
if as seems likely the committee invests the presidency with 
wider powers at the expense of the prime ministry the door will be 
open for a more liberal system which favors the socalled 
pragmatists 
the committee may also downgrade the religious credentials 
needed for leadership and propose a collective leadership of three 
to five figures in the tehran hierarchy 
in the long run id say the pragmatists will win said 
londonbased iran specialist badeq moin whose biography of 
khomeini will be published soon 
but in the short term even the pragmatists will have to 
pretend to be radical in order to survive he said 
survival is the key question for the leadership in iran today 
even if they come up with hardline rhetoric now eventually theyll 
have to cope with the outside world and deisolate themselves in 
order to survive 
one of the central strands in the power struggle is the economy 
the war and chronic mismanagement has left it in bad shape 
the key question is whether those who eventually come out on top 
look inward seeking to galvanize the revolutionary zeal that has 
clearly flagged or outward to end irans isolation that has 
smothered development 
iran faces a social explosion in the years ahead its 
population currently about 55 million will have mushroomed to 100 
million by the end of the century 
unless the country can rebuild and expand drawing on foreign 
financial aid and technology it faces economic and political 
turmoil on a fightening scale

states are increasingly relying on expensive 
residential facilities and state hospitals to treat emotionally 
disturbed children when lowercost communitybased services would 
better serve their needs the national mental health association 
said tuesday 
in its invisible children report the association also said 
states must improve coordination of their child mental health 
services which are often spread among welfare juvenile justice 
education and health systems 
the system for mental health care for children in the united 
states is in shambles and thus very expensive said the report 
estimating states spend more than 1 billion annually on state 
hospital and outofstate residential care for children 
much of this investment could be used more appropriately to 
develop needed communitybased programs which often keep the 
child in the home the report said 
the association estimates that 12 percent to 15 percent of the 
63 million children and adolescents in the united states need 
mental health treatment for emotional or other problems 
based on its estimate that only one in three children in need of 
mental health care is getting it the association recommended that 
states and the federal government triple the resources allocated to 
childrens mental health services association officials said they 
had no estimate of the total amount now spent on these services 
the report cited government and private studies finding that 
residential care is on the rise one study found a 450 percent 
increase in placements of youth in private psychiatric facilities 
during the earlier part of the decade 
about 70 percent of current child mental health funding is spent 
on residential facilties the report said 
policymakers labor under the false assumption that intensive 
services are synonymous only with inpatient care the report 
said 
however the report pointed to inhome crisis programs in 
washington and florida as examples of programs proven effective 
in treating the child preserving the family unit and generating 
cost savings 
the report found startling differences in comparing the costs of 
treatment in residential facilities and state hospitals with those 
in the home and in day treatment centers 
the national average cost of keeping a child in a state hospital 
is 299 per day with the average stay 42 months that amounts to 
38218 nationally the average cost for a residential treatment 
facility is 11167 per day and the average stay is 154 months 
for a total cost of 52300 
in contrast the report estimated the cost of six weeks of 
intensive inhome crisis counseling at 1100 and the cost of a 
year in day treatment for a seriously emotionally disturbed child 
at 15000 to 18000

in a suburb nearly 8000 miles from 
tiananmen square a band of chinese students is working around the 
clock to relay news from the student rebellion to comrades 
throughout china 
defying a chinese news blackout the students are using 
telephones and facsimile machines to contact relatives other 
students hospitals newspapers and even sympathetic government 
officials 
since soliders opened fire on civilians over the weekend the 
students have been trying to confirm rumored troop movements and 
compile an accurate body count 
we get very very different information from different 
sources yuan liu a brandeis university student said tuesday 
many people in beijing they figure out that its at least 30000 
died but here theyre reporting 2600 died 
zhang longxi a harvard university graduate student scanned a 
television set looking for some of the young people he had once 
taught english they had been widely quoted in the early peaceful 
days of the demonstrations because of their english proficiency he 
hasnt seen them since and wears a black armband fearing they 
have died 
one student telephoned his mother a journalist in shanghai to 
relay the latest news of shooting in beijing he warned her that 
troops were rumored to be headed for shanghai and that students 
should evacuate campuses to avoid bloodshed 
his mother said phone communications between beijing and 
shanghai had been all but severed said the student who requested 
anonymity because he fears retaliation against his parents he said 
he considered going home but his parents told him dont even 
think about that 
the students have been operating out of the walker center for 
ecumenical exchange since may 24 when the centers executive 
director the rev gordon schultz offered them half of the 
rambling religious center and three free phone lines 
somehow the word has spread in china that to get your message 
out call here because were getting calls from people we dont 
know schultz said 
he also persuaded a local hotel to donate a fax machine 
khomeinis revolution was revolution by cassette tape 
recorder and this is revolution by fax schultz said 
though it has become increasingly difficult to telephone 
students believe the cable to beijing university has been severed 
and the phone bill is now more than 20000 the students arent 
giving up said xiao xia gong a harvard university graduate 
student and one of the information centers organizers 
first we need to get information from china she said and 
we need to give encouragement to students there that they are not 
forgotten by the world 
the students also want the chinese military to know that the 
rest of the worldis monitoring its actions 
the walker center in this boston suburb has become a haven for 
chinese students worried about their loved ones and frustrated by 
their isolation from the momentous events in their homeland 
the students have been passing information gleaned from their 
sources to american news organizations including voice of america 
schultz said in some cases their information has been confirmed by 
western media reports hours later he said but other reports have 
been impossible to substantiate 
for example three different sources calling from canton 
beijing and nanjing have reported seeing soliders with glassy 
eyes and slack jaws who appear to have been drugged schultz said 
rumor in china has it that the soldiers were injected with some 
moodaltering drug which they were told was an antibiotic in 
order to make them more willing to deal harshly with the students 
he said 
yuan liu said the students have been able to reach foreign 
embassies and banks but are having trouble reaching private 
telephones in beijing 
its better if they call us but its risky because you have to 
give the operator your name and all the phones are bugged he 
said 
he said one student had managed to get through from a pay phone 
to report on the shooting on one of beijings thoroughfares 
shortly after it began 
a student who studied at harvard and had returned to beijing 
called to say that chinese troops were laughing as they randomly 
shot students schultz said 
the students are recording and transcribing all of their 
telephone conversations in an attempt to preserve source materials 
on the democracy movement for history 
the project dubbed tiananmen 1989 archives is being 
supported by the center for east asian studies at the university of 
chicago said zhang longxi 
we feel that this is very very signifcant in terms of the 
historical moment he said this is going to be very 
important

here is a transcript of house republican 
leader bob michels remarks tuesday introducing tom foley as the 
new speaker of the house 
once again i hold in my hand temporarily alas the symbol of 
the authority of the speaker of the house we are taught that it is 
better to give than to receive i believe that 
when it comes to the speakers gavel i have become 
distressingly expert at it having now gone down to defeat for the 
sixth straight time on a party line vote i look forward to the day 
when someone on the other side of the aisle learns the joy of such 
selfless behavior 
my colleagues i know you are anxious to hear from the speaker 
but before presenting him formally to you i would ask your 
forbearance that i make a few comments of my own 
during the recent past we have taken part in a number of 
ceremonies commemorating the bicentennial of the house of 
representatives 
we had a marvelous celebration on this floor in which many of us 
got the opportunity to say what we believed about this great 
institution 
but in a curious irony of history some might say a tragedy of 
history the very year in which we celebrated the great traditions 
and glories of the house it has been blighted by unprecedented 
crises personal and institutional 
today we have that rare most precious improbable of gifts a 
second chance for comprehensive bipartisan institutional reform 
that will set the course for the next century 
let me turn to my friends on the other side of the aisle for a 
moment i hope youll take this in the spirit in which its 
intended 
first no political party no man or woman in the house no 
faction or ideology has a monopoly on virtue human folly is an 
equal opportunity employer no there is no monopoly on virtue 
but for over 35 years there has been a monopoly of power in the 
house 35 years of uninterrupted power can act like a corrosive 
acid upon the restraints of civility and comity those who have 
been kings of the hill for so long may forget that majority status 
is not a divine right and minority status is not a permanent 
condition 
at the heart of our crises are not personal faults of individual 
members after 32 years as a member and over 40 years on the hill 
it is my belief that the personal integrity of the overwhelming 
number of members of this institution is and has been as good or 
better than that of any group in our society especially those who 
criticize the most 
i believe that the processes established by the house to deal 
with ethics cases have to proceed 
the former speaker said in his farewell address to the house 
that this mindless cannibalism has got to stop 
now its a catchy phrase 
but the distinguished members of the ethics committee equally 
divided from both parties are neither mindless nor cannibals 
in fact in fact it is their reasoned judgment under 
extraordinary pressure that stands between us and the cannibalism 
which the speaker referred to 
im all for putting an end to bitterness im all in favor of 
putting our house in order but we dont do so by sweeping things 
under the rug 
this house is in a convulsive state weve experienced some 
really dark days but i take heart in the strengths that are built 
into this institution to cope with the times i also take heart 
that tom foley for whom i have the greatest admiration will be 
the new speaker 
yes were going to have our marked differences thats the 
nature of this place but that need not intrude on the mutual 
respect and the trust that we have for one another as leaders 
tom foley coming from the great pacific northwest reminds me of 
the line of poetry that says but westward look the land is 
bright 
congratulations mr speakerelect let me hand over to you the 
symbol of the great power and the great responsibility you have 
just been given by the house 
ladies and gentlemen of the house what a privilege for me to 
present to you the new speaker of the house of representatives

the amoco pipeline that spilled crude oil 
into the yampa river last week is among hundreds of miles of 
colorado pipelines exempted from government safety inspections 
officials say 
the oil industry persuaded the reagan administration in 1985 to 
drop all federal maintenance inspections of that type of oil 
pipeline known as a gathering line 
as a result the us department of transportations office of 
pipeline safety no longer conducts regular checks on the amoco 
line which leaked about 10000 gallons of light crude friday into 
the yampa river in northwestern colorado but an amoco spokesman 
said the company meets federal standards on such lines 
the spill was declared contained sunday and much of the oil 
that was not contained broke up or was washed away in the swiftly 
flowing river officials said but they said there still could be 
longrange effects on the environment that part of the river is 
home to three endangered fish species 
traces of the spill were found as far away as 100 miles 
downriver from the site 
jack overly who oversees oilpipeline inspections in 12 western 
states from the transportation departments denver regional office 
said he didnt have figures on the number of miles of pipeline were 
exempted from regulation but he estimated the total as 1000 miles 
in colorado alone 
if this leak was caused by corrosion we definitely could have 
had an effect on this pipeline if it still were subject to 
federal regulation and inspection overly said 
amoco executives said the company still does not know what 
caused the leak but overly noting that the leak occurred where 
the pipeline passed beneath the river said rust is the first 
thing i would suspect 
the 6inch line carried more than 100000 gallons of crude oil a 
day 
a gathering line generally links an oil field with storage tanks 
the transportation department still inspects about 500 miles of 
oil pipelines in colorado overly said those pipelines are called 
transmission lines and they generally link refineries with major 
distribution points 
amoco spokesman jack rigg confirmed that the 106mile pipeline 
involved in the leak linking an oil field near craig with storage 
tanks in wamsutter wyo is subject to no state or federal 
inspections 
he said amocos policy on maintenance is to comply with 
federal regulation on all company pipelines even though the 
regulations no longer apply to gathering lines 
he said the line at craig was inspected in 1985 and repaired in 
1986 
overly said that reagan administration officials exempted 
gathering lines from federal regulation after oil executives said 
the pipes didnt pose serious threats to public health because most 
pass through remote terrain

a pipeline that provided 90 percent of the 
gasoline for the las vegas area before it exploded in california 
could be back in operation by friday which could mean a drop in 
prices at the gas pump 
prices jumped as much as a nickel a gallon when the pipeline 
exploded may 25 in san bernardino calif killing two people and 
injuring 31 the blast knocked out the calnev co pipeline that 
carried gasoline and diesel fuel from southern california 
refineries to the las vegas valley 
oil companies had to ship gasoline 300 miles by truck 
increasing the cost of transportation 
arco the dominant oil company in southern nevada raised its 
prices to dealers 5 cents a gallon in the first days following the 
explosion arco officials say the companys prices absolutely 
will drop once the line reopens 
chevron officials say it cost an extra 6 cents a gallon to 
truck gasoline to las vegas and not all costs were passed on to 
dealers 
no gasoline shortages or service station lines have been 
reported in the city 
the price for self service unleaded gasoline has been running 
110 to 112 a gallon since the pipeline explosion

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was buried 
tuesday after a day of tumult in which frenzied mourners snatched 
the shroud from their revered leaders body and tore it to shreds 
for holy relics 
thousands of revolutionary guards and civilians jostled around 
the grave at the baheshte zahra cemetery raising clouds of dust 
as khomeinis body was finally laid to rest at 445 pm 
a television announcer his voice hoarse with emotion chanted 
father dont leave your children oh father dont leave your 
beloved as the crowd surged toward the grave people wept and 
beat their heads and chests with clenched fists in the shiite 
moslem expression of bereavement 
soldiers passed concrete slabs over the sea of mourners and laid 
them across the grave a shallow pit in a 100squareyard section 
of the vast cemetery where men who died in the islamic revolution 
and the 8year war with iraq are buried 
a crane lowered a metal freight container onto the grave to 
prevent people from grabbing handfuls of dirt from it and possibly 
unearthing the body 
guns roared a last salute to the 86yearold patriarch who 
toppled a 2500yearold monarchy in 1979 and transformed iran into 
a militant islamic state for the moment at least no special 
marker was put on the grave 
earlier in the day mourners blocked the path of a van carrying 
the body in an open coffin from the square where it had lain in 
state for 24 hours in an airconditioned glass cubicle 
mourners scrambling for mementos grabbed the tightly wrapped 
white shroud in which moslems are buried and tore it to shreds the 
body fell to the ground and was taken to an ambulance 
state television later showed mourners grabbing at the body and 
shroud exposing the feet then the broadcast was cut off abruptly 
the people love the imam too much said a young man at the 
scene they cannot bear to see him buried he said they wanted 
pieces of the shroud as sacred relics 
iranians refer to khomeini as the imam or spiritual leader 
the coffin was transferred to a military helicopter but the 
crowd rushed forward as it tried to land as the helicopter flew 
away with the coffin protruding from its open door the crowd was 
told the burial had been postponed 
three hours later however a helicopter landed the rewrapped 
body in a metal casket hashemi rafsanjani the parliament speaker 
and khomeinis son ahmad accompanied the body and oversaw the 
burial 
ahmad was knocked down in the earlier melee around the coffin 
and lost his black turban he looked pale and dazed as he was 
hoisted above the crowd and passed from hand to hand to an 
ambulance 
women clad in headtotoe black chadors rubbed shoulders with 
men despite the islamic prohibition of physical contact between a 
woman and any man other than her husband 
firemen sprayed the crowd with jets of water from fire hoses 
most of tehrans 6 million people appeared to be in the streets 
tuesday and official media said millions more came from other 
regions to bid khomeini farewell about 2 million mourners had kept 
a nightlong vigil around the bier in mousalam mosque 22 miles 
north of the cemetery 
eight people were killed monday in the packed square some 
suffocating and others trampled to death about 500 mourners were 
injured or collapsed in temperatures of 104 
khomeini died of a heart attack saturday 11 days after 
intestinal surgery without settling the question of who would 
succeed him 
he left a 29page political testament extracts of which his 
son read over tehran radio monday 
it contained an attack on the united states which khomeini 
called the great satan and said iran should guard against 
the conspiracies and plots of the enemies toward the islamic 
republic 
in the forefront of these is america this vile state 
terrorist which has set fire to the whole world and its ally 
global zionism which to attain its goals commits such crimes 
that pens are ashamed to document them and tongues are ashamed to 
recite them he said 
nothing was said of how iran should be governed after khomeinis 
death but that may be contained in sections not yet released 
president ali khamenei 49 was named caretaker leader on 
sunday winning 60 of 74 votes cast by the assembly of experts a 
group khomeini formed soon after the revolution to handle the 
succession issue 
his swift appointment appeared aimed at filling the political 
vacuum and averting an immediate power struggle between hard liners 
and those who favor restoring ties with the west

at least 50 nuclear weapons and nine nuclear 
reactors the products of us and soviet naval accidents since 
world war ii are lost on the ocean floor greenpeace officials 
said tuesday 
there are more likely more soviet weapons and reactors on the 
bottom of the ocean said william m arkin coauthor of the 
report by the greenpeace environmental group which favors 
nuclearfree seas and the institute for policy studies a liberal 
research group 
using data obtained through the freedom of information act the 
groups found that more than 2000 major peacetime naval accidents 
have occurred since 1945 resulting in some 2800 deaths the 
accidents ranged from the loss of an entire vessel and crew to 
minor collisions and fires that left little damage and some 
injuries 
the researchers omitted incidents that occurred during the 
vietnam and korean wars and in the persian gulf during the 
iraniraq war arkin said 
since world war ii 10 us and soviet accidents and a decision 
by the united states to intentionally scuttle one reactor have 
left 50 sunken warheads and nine reactors on the ocean floor 
fortythree of the 50 warheads and six of the nine reactors are 
soviet 
the report specifically details 1276 accidents including the 
soviet mikeclass submarine that sank in the norwegian sea on april 
7 with two nuclear tipped torpedoes and two nuclear reactors aboard 
the most serious incident apparently was the sinking of a soviet 
yankeeclass submarine with 32 nuclear warheads and two nuclear 
torpedoes aboard the sinking occurred 600 miles northeast of 
bermuda on oct 6 1986 
but arkin said the number of nuclear weapons on the ocean floor 
may be higher because we are ascribing only two nuclear torpedoes 
to each soviet submarine they could of course have more 
arkin said researchers received no information from the soviet 
union for their study and when we asked the us intelligence 
community to provide us with their analysis of soviet accidents 
they declined to do so on the basis of security 
the report found that of the accidents 228 involved aircraft 
carriers 406 other major surface warships 182 supply ships 142 
minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels 
seventyfive incidents involved sinkings of these 27 were 
submarines five of them soviet four american four french and 
three british as well as submarines from west germany israel 
pakistan peru spain and turkey 
in accident after accident after accident human failure is 
the responsible cause arkin said 
in addition about 30 percent of the 1276 accidents occurred in 
ports possibly endangering civilians nearby said joshua handler 
the reports other coauthor and a researcher with greenpeace of 
those accidents 624 occurred in the atlantic ocean 318 in the 
pacific 110 in the mediterranean sea and 34 in the indian ocean 
greenpeace earlier revealed information about two us accidents 
that received wide publicity over the past month in 1965 an a4 
warplane fell off the uss ticonderoga near okinawa with a hydrogen 
bomb aboard and on nov 22 1975 a fire aboard the uss belknap 
came within 40 feet of nuclear weapons 
arkin said he suspected that the sinking of a soviet destroyer 
in the black sea in 1974 involved nuclear weapons or reactors but 
said that has never been verified holding up a russianlanguage 
version of the study he said a copy would be delivered to the 
soviet embassy in washington

haggling in a central asian bazaar over the price 
of strawberries sparked a spasm of ethnic violence arson attacks 
and rampages by axwielding mobs in which 50 people were killed 
uzbekistans communist party chief reported tuesday 
rafik nishanov told lawmakers in moscow that authorities had 
reestablished full control in the fergana valley 1500 miles 
southeast of moscow following more than a week of bloody clashes 
between uzbeks and members of an ethnic turkish minority the 
meskhi but he indicated the situation was still explosive 
an interior ministry spokesman said 6000 internal security 
troops had been sent to restore order in the fergana valley a 
national center of grape and cotton growing 
some of the 12000 meskhi in the area were evacuated sunday and 
monday to a military garrison to be housed in barracks under guard 
the uzbek leader said in nationally televised remarks they are 
safe now nishanov said 
the violence between the two moslem groups was the latest 
outbreak of soviet ethnic unrest and its roots could be traced to 
the brutal policies of josef stalin who uprooted the entire 
population of 300000 meskhi from their homeland in soviet georgia 
in november 1944 and deported them to the east under pretext of 
evacuation as the germans approached 
the meskhi began to demand in 1956 that they be allowed to 
return to meskhetia their homeland in the caucasus and nishanov 
said they had been pressing their demands harder as the countrys 
new parliament the congress of peoples deputies meets in moscow 
interior ministry spokesman col boris mikhailov told the tass 
news agency the clashes between uzbeks and the meskhi turks began 
may 23 when a fight provoked by extremists in the city of 
kuvasai near the border of soviet kirghizia caused the death of one 
man and injured 60 others 
last saturday mikhailov said about 200 hooligans armed with 
metal rods sticks and bottles filled with gasoline staged pogroms 
and set fire to buildings in the town of tashlak he said 
dozens of cars and houses were burned 
the violence was spawned by an insignificant minor conflict 
at a market when a meskhi turk rudely spoke to a woman selling 
fruit whose prices he thought were too high then knocked over her 
plate of strawberries nishanov said 
citizens there perceived this as an insult and a fight 
started nishanov told the soviet of nationalities one of the 
houses of the bicameral soviet legislature during its inaugural 
session tuesday 
tempers enflamed by the marketplace squabble cooled but meskhis 
later attacked a group of uzbeks and killed one of them nishanov 
said 
calm was restored he said but about a week later he said a 
large group of uzbeks ranging in age from 15 to 22 and in high 
spirits as a result of alcohol or drugs unexpectedly set off to 
attack the homes where the meskhi live 
the uzbek youth armed with sticks chains and axes beat up 
people they found on the way and set fire to some homes belonging 
to meskhi turks nishanov said 
soviet television reported monday night that the dispute in the 
fergana valley turned into vicious clashes between thousands of 
furious people it said the violence began as an ethnic dispute 
but was fueled by chronic local unemployment 
nishanov told lawmakers that according to information available 
tuesday about 50 people had been killed including 35 or more 
meskhi turks 10 uzbeks one ethnic tadzhik and an ethnic russian 
who had been among those who restored order 
mikhailov told tass that 200 people suspected of organizing and 
taking part in the rioting had been detained a curfew was imposed 
in the area nishanov said 
komsolmolskaya pravda the daily organ of the komsomol young 
communist league said a total of 194 people had been hospitalized 
and that policemen and party workers were among the casualities 
the government daily izvestia said interior ministry troops and 
officers were also hurt 
almaz estekov a moslem activist in moscow said representatives 
of the unofficial grassroots movement berlik in tashkent 
uzbekistans capital told him by telephone that 13 policemen had 
been killed 
but calls from moscow to the fergana valley did not go through 
tuesday and the report could not be independently confirmed 
the meskhi were used as the principal labor force in 
constructing the irrigation system in the barren golodnaya steppe 
of northcentral uzbekistan which was turned into a flourishing 
agricultural district 
the meskhi are ethnically related to the georgians but were 
under turkish rule during the 16th and 17th centuries converted to 
islam and adopted many turkish characteristics at present some 
meskhi consider themselves turks while others consider themselves 
georgians

a military court on tuesday acquitted 
an army major of charges that he took part in an attempt to 
overthrow the government of president corazon aquino in 1987

an appeals court will let topeka officials 
decide how to correct violations of the 35yearold landmark us 
supreme court decision to desegregate schools and busing is not a 
likely option lawyers said tuesday 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals panel in denver said that 
although topeka officials had not resisted integration mandated by 
the brown vs the board of education decision in 1954 segregation 
still existed the courts 21 ruling released monday requires 
topeka to remedy racial imbalances in its public schools 
i doubt that were talking about busing said rich jones an 
attorney for a group of parents who brought the desegregation 
lawsuit i doubt if were talking about anything really radical 
this school district is not one of the worst school districts it 
wasnt the worst we had seen or the worst we had read about 
gary sebelius the school districts attorney said speculation 
on what officials will have to do is premature 
they didnt tell us what to do he said something has to 
be be done they dont say what 
barbara kudlacek the districts spokeswoman added theres 
too much that has to happen before we even start to discuss that i 
dont think there are easy answers 
the district could ask the appellate court for a rehearing 
before all 10 judges and if it gets a similar decision there it 
could appeal to the us surpeme court sebelius said he didnt 
know whether the board would seek a rehearing 
no one has suggested that we have anything less than an 
excellent program sebelius said theres just a differing view 
as to whether its done all it could do 
in 1954 the us supreme court ruled that segregated school 
systems were unconstitutional because separate facilities for 
blacks and whites provided inherently unequal educational 
opportunities the ruling came in a lawsuit against the topeka 
district which had set aside four elementary schools for black 
children 
in 1979 parents of 17 black schoolchildren sued the district 
again contending it had not eliminated vestiges of segregation 
the parents included linda brown buckner a student in 1954 whose 
unmarried name is on the landmark case 
the reopened case sometimes called brown ii went to trial in 
october 1986 us district judge richard rogers of topeka ruled in 
april 1987 that the school district did not bear liability for 
racial imbalances in some of its schools because the parents failed 
to prove it intentionally tried to keep schools segregated 
the appeals court said rogers applied too strict a standard and 
said the parents merely had to prove segregation existed given the 
history of the district 
the parents had pointed to seven elementary schools and one 
middle school that they said had a disproportionately high number 
of minority students at the time of the trial 26 percent of the 
topekas schoolchildren were from minority groups and 19 percent 
were black there are about 14000 students in the district 
dan biles a lawyer for the state board of education said he 
was not sure what the appellate courts decision will mean in 
practical terms biles said he thinks the court has narrowed the 
scope of the case to focus on the assignment of students to 
schools school attendance boundaries and the assignment of faculty 
and staff 
although he was reluctant to discuss specific solutions jones 
suggested that the district may consider tinkering with attendance 
boundaries or improving curriculum at some predominantly black 
schools

adm william j crowe the senior us 
military officer begins his first visit to the soviet union next 
monday and will ask his soviet counterparts to spell out their 
proposals to cut conventional forces in europe 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in his armscut 
proposals has talked about men and he has talked about weapons 
systems crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told 
reporters at the pentagon on tuesday 
there are a lot of questions in our mind about exactly what 
that means and what dismantling means and what they will do with 
those systems and what systems they are talking about those 
questions have not all been answered said crowe who during his 
11day visit will go to five of the 15 soviet republics 
the eastern and western alliances have recently proposed very 
similar ideas for cutting conventional forces in central europe 
but have not yet concluded a deal 
crowe said that he would ask the soviets why they recently 
increased tank production despite statements by gorbachev that 
defense spending would be cut by 14 percent and military production 
by 20 percent over coming years 
during the trip crowe may sign an agreement on curbing dangerous 
military incidents such as the shooting death of maj arthur 
nicholson at the hands of soviet soldiers in east germany on march 
24 1985 
crowe said the proposed agreement would address naval incidents 
inside territorial waters such as the bumping of two us navy 
vessels by soviet ships off the crimea in the black sea on feb 12 
1988 and the use of laser range finders that might blind soldiers 
or sailors on the either side 
the visit by crowe who will be accompanied by the vice chiefs 
of the four us military services follows a tour of the united 
states last july by marshal sergei akhromeyev then the soviet 
chief of staff akhromeyev has since become an adviser to 
gorbachev and been replaced as defense minister by col gen 
mikhail a moiseyev 
the americans according to an itinerary handed out at the 
briefing will visit an unidentified soviet missile facility near 
khelmnitsky in the ukraine see a ground exercise in byelorussia 
and ride on a soviet missile cruiser and watch a naval maneuver off 
murmansk the northern soviet port on the barents sea 
crowe a submariner has asked to see the inside of a submarine 
a request that the soviets have neither accepted nor rejected 
my instincts tell me that they will be very forthcoming he 
said 
he will also deliver an address at the voroshilov military 
academy and visit numerous graveyards laying a total of seven 
wreaths 
i dont know who is behind the wreaths he joked at the 
briefing 
the visit also includes time for extensive discussions with 
soviet military leaders 
certainly my purpose is not to negotiate but i discovered 
last year when marshal akhromeyev and he and i had many hours 
together talking that it was very fruitful at least from my 
perspective crowe said 
we clarified things we attempted to brush away some of the 
misunderstandings there are a lot of questions that military 
people always carry around in their minds often we develop on our 
own the wrong answers this gives me an opportunity to address my 
counterparts directly he said 
when marshal akhromeyev departed last year i felt much better 
about what i knew and what they were saying and so forth said 
crowe 
the admiral said that us intelligence on soviet military 
capabilities has been good but obviously in certain areas we 
have done better than in others 
we have been surprised on occasion we have not done as well 
as we would prefer marshal akhromeyev and i actually talked about 
that i think there is a builtin tendency to overestimate the 
strength of opponents he said 
marshal akhromeyev and i on occasion pointed out to each other 
that he didnt understand our forces i told him that he 
overestimated my capability and he told me that i greatly 
overestimated his he was talking about ground and i was talking 
about navy said crowe a naval officer akhromeyev is an army 
officer 
crowe also predicted that the two sides would discuss the 
military crackdown in china and developments in north and south 
korea we will both have some curiosity about the others 
feelings about what is going on in that part of the world

president bush on tuesday told visiting 
pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto that the united states is 
willing to explore any serious avenue to achieve a political 
solution in afghanistan 
mrs bhutto in turn said after private talks with the president 
that we are in complete accord on the situation in afghanistan 
stalemated since the pullout of the last soviet troops in february 
bush said the withdrawal of the red army proved the 
effectiveness of uspakistani support for the afghan resistance 
fighting the marxist regime in kabul pakistan shares a common 
border with afghanistan 
we agreed however that the job is not done said bush 
the mujahdeen continues and their struggle for selfdetermination 
goes on 
prime minister bhutto and i discussed ways to encourage a 
political solution in afghanistan that will lead to a nonaligned 
representative government willing to live in peace with its 
neighbors to replace the illegitimate regime in kabul said 
bush the united states and pakistan will continue to explore any 
serious avenue towards this end 
us officials had anticipated a rapid demise for the government 
of najibullah after the soviet pullout but it has not happened 
mrs bhutto said she and bush have reviewed the situation in 
the light of the prevailing circumstances and we are in complete 
accord on what needs to be done 
pakistan remains committed to a political solution of the 
afghan problem whereby the brave people of afghanistan will have 
the right to freely choose their own government without 
interference from outside she said 
mrs bhutto the daughter of former prime minister ali bhutto 
said that while the soviet pullout has brought a welcome change 
in afghanistan the continued fighting and prolonged presence of 
over 35 million afghan refugees pose serious threats to the peace 
and stability of the region 
after a fulldress military ceremony on the white house lawn 
including a 19gun salute and an oval office meeting with bush 
mrs bhutto went to the state department for a meeting with 
secretary of state james a baker iii and a lunch in her honor 
pakistan has a standing request to buy 60 more f16 fighter jets 
from the united states bush brushed aside reporters attempts to 
ask about reports that approval of the jet sale is imminent 
on another topic bush said mrs bhutto assured me that 
pakistans nuclear program is committed to peaceful purposes 
he said he underlined his commitment to discourage 
proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons ballistic missiles 
in the south asia region and around the world 
the two leaders also discussed efforts to combat drug production 
and trafficking bush said he applauded her tough stance on 
eradicating the opium cultivation and thanked her for extraditing 
an alleged drug trafficker 
the two countries were expected to sign agreements on housing 
narcotics and education this week during bhuttos stay pakistan 
the third largest recipient of us aid is slated for 380 million 
in economic assistance and 240 million in military aid next year 
mrs bhuttos father was deposed by gen mohammad zia ulhaq in 
1977 and hanged two years later for a political murder zia 
remained in power until perishing in a mysterious plane crash last 
year that also claimed the life of us ambassador arnold raphel 
and an american general 
mrs bhutto who had picked up her fathers fallen standard and 
been jailed for a time under zia led her pakistan peoples party 
to victory as head of a coalition government last november 
mrs bhutto was scheduled to address a joint session of congress 
on wednesday she also had stops here at the world bank and 
international monetary fund she will receive an honorary degree at

the race is on for the seat left vacant by the 
death of rep claude pepper with early expectations that the aug 
29 special election called tuesday could produce the first cuban 
exile in congress 
gov bob martinez announced the election schedule one day after 
burial of the 88yearold congressman following a week of 
ceremonies and mourning 
claude pepper will be difficult if not impossible to replace 
in congress but its vitally important that we move as quickly as 
possible so that the people of floridas 18th congressional 
district can be represented martinez said 
some leaders of the republican party riding a wave of gop 
momentum in the state were focusing upon state sen ileana 
roslehtinen of miami as their leading candidate for the seat that 
had been held by pepper a liberal democrat since its inception 
carlos perez a cubanborn millionaire banana importer and 
active supporter of ronald reagan and oliver north also said he 
will run as a republican 
democrats with a longer list of interested candidates had no 
one publicly committed 
the democrats should probably rally behind one candidate 
said miami city commissioner rosario kennedy a cubanamerican 
among the potential democratic contenders but its too early 
a first primary was set for aug 1 and any runoff would be aug 
15 martinez said elections would be held on the same day to 
replace state officeholders who seek the congressional seat under 
state law they have to resign before they run 
candidates must file their nominating petitions with the state 
division of elections on june 19 or 20 
pepper known nationwide for his efforts on behalf on the 
elderly won every election for the district since the first in 
1962 with his closest race in the past decade a 6139 percent 
victory in 1984 over cubanamerican ricardo nunez last year he 
had no opposition at all 
but republicans have gained strength in the district as 
democratic registration has sagged from 72 percent a decade ago to 
54 percent now 
hispanics estimated by some politicians to comprise nearly half 
the district are considered likely to support a cuban candidate 
its estimated that threequarters of cubanamerican voters in the 
region are republican 
i think the chances are pretty good for a cubanamerican to be 
elected from that district said sergio bendixen a democratic 
strategist without a doubt that person would be the most 
powerful cubanamerican in the country 
miami mayor xavier suarez elected in 1985 as the citys first 
cubanborn mayor ruled himself out of the house race tuesday 
suarez an independent didnt formally endorse anyone but praised 
roslehtinen she meanwhile said she would hold a news conference 
wednesday to discuss her future 
republican state rep al gutman a cubanborn jew whose heritage 
fits two large ethnic groups in the district was also mulling his 
possibilities tuesday 
on the democratic side state sen jack gordon said he will 
decide by friday whether to run gordon 67 shares much of 
peppers constituency and liberalism but may have problems with 
hispanic voters because of his opposition to nicaraguan contra aid 
and other foreign policy issues 
raul martinez cubanborn mayor of hialeah has long said hed 
like to run for congress but spokesman steve bovo said martinez 
would wait to hear gordons decision 
other potential democratic candidates include commissioner 
kennedy miami beach mayor alex daoud dade county commissioner joe 
gersten state attorney janet reno and former school board chairman 
paul cejas cejas and kennedy are cubanborn 
in the 1988 elections florida gave george bush his largest 
margin in any state and republicans gained a us senate seat two 
house seats and two state cabinet jobs republicans then claimed a 
109 majority in the congressional delegation when rep bill grant 
of tallahassee switched parties after the election

a decoy drug designed to hopelessly confuse the 
aids virus by mimicking its natural target is safe and may lower 
levels of the lethal virus inside the body researchers said 
tuesday 
scientists said they were encouraged by the results but they 
cautioned that testing is at an early stage and no one can be sure 
how effective the medicine will be in stopping aids 
nevertheless this represents an exciting step forward said 
dr ian weller of middlesex school of medicine in england 
the drug is known as soluble cd4 and it is one of more than a 
dozen currently being used experimentally against the aids virus 
so far only one medicine azt has been approved by the us 
food and drug administration for use against hiv the aids virus 
while it can prolong the lives of people with aids it does not 
cure the disease and it has a variety of toxic side effects 
its clear that we desperately need alternative treatments to 
azt said dr thomas merigan of stanford university 
reports on cd4 and other potential aids drugs were presented at 
the 5th international conference on aids the major annual meeting 
to review progress against the epidemic 
dr james mason us assistant secretary for health said 
progress in drug development is another success in our war 
against this terrible infection 
mason also it is increasingly important to set up voluntary 
programs to contact sexual partners of hivinfected people so they 
will know of their risk of catching the virus 
cd4 is one of a growing group of medicines that are specifically 
designed to exploit the builtin weaknesses of the aids virus 
in this case the medicine is a synthetic copy of a molecule 
called cd4 these molecules cover the surface of a particular 
variety of blood cells known as helper t cells 
these cells orchestrate the bodys immune system and they are 
the chief targets of hiv the virus finds them by zeroing in on cd4 
researchers reason that by flooding the bloodstream with copies 
of cd4 the virus will mistakenly attack these decoys and miss the 
blood cells 
in preliminary studies on 18 people at the national cancer 
institute doctors found that shortterm treatment with cd4 
appeared to reduce the amount of virus in their bodies by about 50 
percent 
however dr robert yarchoan who directed the study cautioned 
that such fluctuations can occur naturally and might not have 
resulted from the drug none of the patients got better during the 
19day experiment 
the results could have been better but they could have been a 
lot worse yarchoan said i still have a lot of enthusiasm for 
this approach it has one of the best chances of therapeutic effect 
with the least toxicity of anything being discussed right now 
a second preliminary study conducted on 30 patients at san 
francisco general hospital and new england deaconess hospital in 
boston found no clear evidence of viral reduction 
the two studies were intended primarily to determine how large a 
dose of the medicine can be safely given 
dr j davis allan who led the study at the boston hospital 
said i am very encouraged that the drug appears to be safe the 
study was not designed to detect subtle degrees of efficacy we may 
have not reached the effective dose yet 
researchers hope to make cd4 last longer in the bloodstream by 
chemically welding it to part of an antibody they also have 
developed another hybrid that joins cd4 with a poison a 
combination that might kill infected cells that make virus inside 
the body 
merigan said that 17 experimental aids drugs are being given to 
7000 patients in studies sponsored by the us national institutes 
of health and tests of six more will start soon

an ordinance immediately banning the sale 
of militarystyle assault weapons in unincorporated areas of 
alameda county was passed tuesday by the county board of 
supervisors 
the 51 vote followed action by gov george deukmejian and the 
legislature restricting the sale of more than 50 kinds of 
semiautomatic assault weapons throughout california 
supervisor don perata said the alameda county ordinance closes a 
loophole in the state measure which allows people to buy 
semiautomatic weapons until january and to apply for permits to 
keep them after january 
the state law created a window of opportunity to buy the 
weapons perata said 
this ordinance intends to ban such sales immediately in the 
county to prevent those who would evade the law from stockpiling an 
arsenal while these weapons are still legally available he said 
he said he was concerned about weapon stockpiling by drug 
dealers and others who have ravaged our communities

iranian opposition leaders predict they will return 
from exile with the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini but some 
analysts believe history has passed them by 
former government officials and the son of the late deposed 
shah are granting interviews and issuing statements the mujahedeen 
khalq rebel army based in iraq says its fighters are on alert and 
awaiting the opportune moment to enter into action 
former president abolhassan banisadr said he certainly 
would leave his exile home outside paris to return to iran but did 
not say when 
reza pahlavi son of shah mohammad reza pahlavi says khomeinis 
death opens a door to our success the shiite moslem 
patriarchs fundamentalist revolution overthrew the monarchy a 
decade ago 
adm ahmad madani a former defense minister considered the dark 
horse among the exiles sees six months as a probable time for his 
return 
fred halliday professor of international relations at the 
london school of economics dismissed all the predictions and plans 
none of them counts for anything he said theyre all 
hasbeens of one kind or another they all exaggerate their 
importance there are plenty of candidates inside iran and they 
dont have to look for retreads 
not every student of iranian affairs makes such a blunt 
assessment but the consensus is that power struggles inside iran 
must run their course before outsiders will have a chance to enter 
the fray 
khomeini died saturday 11 days after undergoing surgery for 
internal bleeding president ali khamenei a junior cleric was 
chosen as caretaker leader 
opposition figures say with rare unanimity that the choice of 
khamenei reveals a vacuum in the iranian leadership the lack of a 
replacement with the charisma of khomeini they predict initial 
chaos leading to a more moderate iran 
with khomeinis death the islamic republic died as well 
pahlavi 27 said in a telephone interview his passing away 
leaves a much more direct door to our success 
halliday who follows iranian events closely said he believes 
pahlavi is the only opposition figure with a potential role to play 
and that only a crisis will present the opportunity 
he is a symbol of an alternative and by definition not 
associated with the revolution or the current regime halliday 
said what he represents is a nostalgia for the past plus 
certain changes because he wouldnt go back to the old regime 
he is the only one who would command significant respect in 
contemporary iran the rest are just talking in paris cafes 
since the iranian revolution put khomeini in power in february 
1979 politically active exiles and their leaders have clustered in 
paris khomeini banished by the shah directed his revolution from 
france 
in 1980 after his father died of cancer pahlavi took the crown 
and became shahinexile he says now however that restoring the 
monarchy is not his goal 
i positively believe that the monarchy is the most viable 
alternative for the country but my mission is not the restoration 
of the monarchy he said his effort to unite the fractious 
opposition shows no signs of bearing fruit and many dismiss young 
pahlavi as the least plausible leader among the exiles 
the regime of royalty was buried forever in the cemetery of 
irans history said ayatollah mehdi rouhani spiritual leader of 
europes shiite community 
safa haeri an iranian journalist specializing in asian and 
middle eastern affairs suggests reza pahlavi could return home 
in four or five years if the moderates really consolidate 
power 
he suggested madani the former defense minister as possibly in 
the best position to profit from the changes in iran like some of 
the others madani maintains contacts within the tehran leadership 
the mujahadeen khalq has vowed to topple the regime in iran but 
they are heavily supported by neighboring iraq the iraqis are 
unlikely to endorse any immediate effort to invade iran iraq and 
iran despite differences on a permanent peace are anxious to keep 
alive their current ceasefire truce in their 8yearold war

a year after flames swept through 
yellowstone national park and the rest of the northern rocky 
mountains wildfire experts warn that things could get just as hot 
this summer in california and the southwest 
were dry and it doesnt look real hopeful for getting into a 
wet pattern said steve brown of the national weather service 
staff meteorologist at the boise interagency fire center 
drought conditions have eased if not ended in idaho and the 
rest of the northern tier of states in the west but they continue 
unabated in the southern rockies arizona new mexico and central 
and southern california brown said tuesday at a briefing on the 
regions fire season outlook 
the boise facility is the federal governments logistics and 
support nerve center for firefighting activities across north 
america 
spokesman arnold hartigan said the 27587 wildfires reported 
nationwide through monday were almost 18000 fewer than the same 
date last year but this years fires are bigger the 831988 acres 
burned through monday was almost 300000 acres more than in 1988 
most of the 1989 fires so far have been in florida and the 
southwest hartigan said 
brown said arizona and new mexico have received only about 60 
percent of normal precipitation since the current water year began 
last october california has received 100 percent statewide but 
most of that moisture has been in the north leaving southern 
california dangerously dry 
idaho has received 102 percent of normal precipitation thanks 
to a fairly heavy winter snowpack and abnormally wet march brown 
said 
but even here the soil is so dry after two years of drought 
that it will take an additional 5 to 10 inches of precipitation 
particularly in southeastern idaho and the central mountains 
before the drought can really be declared over 
idaho and most of the rest of the northern rockies are expected 
to get near normal precipitation through august which isnt 
much brown said the outlook is bleaker in the southwest where 
the only hope for improvement is the chance that monsoons will make 
their way north from mexico later in the summer 
if we dont get that its going to be a long year he said 
nationally the boise fire centers hartigan said logistics 
support is in place for the season no matter how bad it gets 
we always prepare for every fire season as if its going to be 
the worst in history he said for the past four or five years 
its been doing its best to prove us right

sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate 
finance committee on tuesday introduced a bill aimed at ensuring 
that lowerpaid workers get a fair share of employerpaid health 
insurance coverage 
the bill was signed by 32 other senators including 15 members 
of the finance committee it would substitute for a much criticized 
provision of the 1986 tax overhaul known as section 89 
section 89 has a desirable goal that rankandfile employees 
should have taxfavored health and life benefits comparable to 
those provided to other wellpaid employees but the road map for 
getting there is too complicated for most american businesses to 
understand said bentsen dtexas it isnt working and even 
the socalled experts cant understand the details 
the law requires employers to demonstrate through complex and 
often expensive tests that their health insurance plans do not 
discriminate in favor of higherpaid employees that generally 
means employees earning more than about 50000 a year 
employers have complained loudly about the rules in some cases 
critics say employers have decided it would be simpler and less 
expensive to drop all health coverage for all workers 
the treasury department has delayed enforcement of the rules 
until oct 1 there is strong pressure in congress to repeal the 
rules altogether the senate spent a good part of its session 
tuesday debating repeal 
however the bush administration bentsen and rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee are calling for major changes rather than repeal 
bentsens bill would delay the rules until january it would 
view as nondiscriminatory any plan that offered health insurance 
to 90 percent of all employees with the employer paying at least 60 
percent of the premium 
rostenkowski earlier introduced a bill that in essence would 
accept any health plan that was available to 90 percent of 
rankandfile workers for an employee premium not exceeding 10 a 
week for a single person or 20 for family coverage

workers kept pumping gas into a leaking pipeline 
for nearly an hour after it already had blown to pieces spawning a 
fireball that engulfed two trains and turned scores of people into 
ash staterun media said tuesday 
soviet news reports said at least 190 people died in the 
pipeline blast early sunday morning on the transsiberian railroad 
about 750 miles southeast of moscow 
some of the 762 people who were hospitalized with injuries from 
the blast are expected to die according to television news program 
vremya it said said half of the injured had burns over more 
than 70 percent of their bodies 
more than 200 people still were missing and some officials said 
the final death toll could reach 500 
health minister yevgeny chazov told the government newspaper 
izvestia that the third and fourth days are the most critical for 
burn victims and that soviet doctors lack experience in treating 
such severe burns 
this lack of experience obviously is complicating our work 
he said 
izvestia said doctors had determined 170 injured children needed 
special equipment to help them breathe and that they were 
appealing for advice and urgent airlifts of equipment from west 
germany japan the united states and italy 
a spokesman for us industrialist armand hammer said 10 kidney 
dialysis machines were being sent from the united states 
the blast occurred when a pipeline carrying a highly flammable 
mixture of benzene propane and butane sprang a leak filling a 
forested valley with concentrations of gas the gas was ignited by 
a spark from one of the two trains on the transsiberian line 
nearby 
the trains were traveling in opposite directions and had made 
unscheduled stops in the valley in the ural mountains 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and other officials have 
charged that workers in charge of the pipeline noticed a drop in 
pressure before the blast but increased pressure instead of 
shutting the line down 
vremya said tuesday night that the workers continued to pump 
gas through the pipeline for 55 minutes after the blast 
an exasperated gorbachev briefing parliamentarians monday after 
he returned from the scene cited incompetence irresponsibility 
mismanagement disgrace in the work of the pipeline 
kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov also speaking to izvestia said 
the secret police had sent a team of investigators to the area near 
ufa to establish the truth 
kryuchkov said the kgb was carrying out a careful 
investigation of the reasons and circumstances of this 
extraordinary event we understand the great difficultly of this 
work 
the kgb will do all thats possible to establish the truth and 
publicize the results of our work he said 
kryuchkov said the kgb was working with prosecutors and the 
interior and health ministries 
the blast was heard 16 miles away and the soviet military chief 
of staff gen mikhail a moiseyev told the official tass news 
agency monday that it had the power of 10000 tons of tnt or half 
the power of the first atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima 
japan 
many of the victims including children on the way to summer 
camp were burned beyond recognition said the communist party 
daily pravda 
identification of some of them is extremely difficult and in 
some cases nothing is left but ashes pravda said 
the blast stripped the 25 miles of trees and turned rail 
passenger cars into twisted hulks of charred metal 
dozens of airplanes and helicopters ferried the injured from the 
site of the blast to hospitals in the nearby cities of chelyabinsk 
and ufa izvestia said 65 of the most severely burned including 
eight children had been brought to moscow for treatment

the impact of jim wrights fall from power was 
stark and swift tuesday as the former house speaker remained in 
his capitol office while his successor of only an hour headed to a 
white house meeting with the president 
even as wright nominated rep tom foley of washington as speaker 
in a somber speech on the house floor workers were trundling his 
possessions out of the speakers ceremonial office on 
canvascovered carts 
asked his plans as foley prepared to take wrights place at the 
table with president bush at a meeting on clean air legislation 
wright replied i have to get on the phone and call my wife 
a day earlier wright was sitting next to bush as the 
congressional leadership gathered with the president to discuss 
foreign policy 
the fort worth democrat a member of the house leadership for 
the last 12 of his 34 years in congress spent his final moments as 
speaker holding his regular presession news conference but 
revealed little about his plans or his state of mind he declared 
simply i feel fine 
forced out of his leadership job over ethics questions wright 
plans to resign his congressional seat later this month 
in a week wright said he would be enjoying life i hope and 
trust rejoicing in the good portion that has followed me and the 
opportunities that have been given me in life 
as giant orange trash cans waited to be filled with cardboard 
boxes stuffed full of folders frames and plaques in his staffs 
adjacent office wright was asked if he had any parting words 
i might express my appreciation to all of you for keeping a 
robust discussion going he told a room packed full of reporters 
i might want to write a column or two someone suggested i should 
become a columnist it might be a good thing in fact i might 
discover who these unnamed sources are 
just 45 minutes before he was to nominate foley before house 
democrats wright closeted himself in his office with notes written 
the night before and wrote his last speech as speaker 
a spokesman said wright had not yet decided whether he would 
move to his congressional district office in the longworth house 
office building until he resigns his seat but it was clear that he 
and his staff were being pushed quickly out of the speakers 
ceremonial office although wright also has a personal office in 
the capitol 
a floor below outside the dining room where texas democrats 
have met for lunch on wednesdays with wright as their leader rep 
bill richardson dnm said he sensed an aura of hopefulness 
mixed with sadness pervading the capitol 
for the first time in three months i feel upbeat because the 
ascension of foley promises a great deal in the area of rebuilding 
the institution of the house which is at its lowest level 
richardson said 
at the same time he said he felt sadness for wright who had 
campaigned for him and looked after new mexicos interests in 
congress 
but ive talked to the speaker and hes at peace with himself 
and that made me feel better richardson said he looks serene 
he looks comfortable in the last month he had looked 
crestfallen 
wright resigned after a yearlong investigation by the house 
ethics committee that cost more than 15 million and led to 
allegations that wright had violated house ethics rules 69 times 
the allegations surrounded sales of wrights book reflections 
of a public man his wifes employment by a family friend fort 
worth developer george mallick and his relationship with mallick 
while texans mourned the loss of a texas speaker and the clout 
and influence he gave their delegation many predicted the scrappy 
former boxer from weatherford would not disappear from the national 
scene 
hell not whimper away and crawl into some hole somewhere 
said rep jim chapman dtexas he said wright a strongwilled 
man with strong ideas would probably want to continue to play a 
part in national affairs writing speaking or teaching 
he is healthy and well and feeling good and hes going to be 
able to contribute to political debate and thought for many 
years chapman said hes got too much talent to go off and 
spend time in a boat and fish

solidarity says it does not want to govern 
despite its overwhelming public mandate in sundays parliamentary 
elections but if the independent union wont who will 
thats the question facing both the opposition and government 
authorities following solidaritys big victory over the communist 
party in the first largely democratic elections in the east bloc in 
more than four decades 
the communist polish united workers party is making no secret of 
the fact that it wants some sort of coalition or alliance with the 
solidarityled opposition as deputy government spokesman zbyslaw 
rykowski said tuesday we need one another 
but solidarity was born and thrived as an opposition movement 
and has no appetite for assuming power in any way but through 
completely unfettered elections in four years 
solidarityendorsed candidates accumulated majorities of 7080 
percent sunday in practically every race they entered out of 261 
candidates for the twochamber national legislature it seems that 
only eight failed to get the 50 percent of the vote needed to avoid 
a runoff election on june 18 
in a normal parliamentary democracy solidarity next would 
peacefully assume the reins of power but the polish elections were 
governed by the inescapable reality that poland remains a communist 
state and so before agreeing to the elections authorities were 
able to insist on reserving 65 percent of the parliament seats only 
for communists and their allies 
as it turned out the communists were having trouble filling 
even these guaranteed seats 
some of the partys bestknown leaders including prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski and eight politburo members appear to have 
been rejected by more than half the voters even though they ran 
unopposed for parliament on a national list of 35 candidates 
in a magnanimous gesture the solidarity leadership affirmed 
tuesday that it will live up to the 65 percent35 percent division 
of the parliaments lower house the sejm that was provided for 
under the april 3 accord between the union and government on 
sweeping social reforms 
but while that saves the party from having to stage a messy 
court or parliament fight for its seats it does not allay the 
humiliation of the partys loss and the resulting undermining of 
its standing at home and abroad 
everyone now understands that in fully free elections the party 
would not stand the slightest chance of winning office 
anticipating the loss of the national list in an informal 
talk with reporters last week senior politburo member jozef czyrek 
was blunt about the possibilities 
defeat of the list would be the biggest political joke ever 
committed in poland he said with polish reform communists who 
agreed to the elections being perceived as having committed 
political suicide they would be laughing like mad in prague and 
berlin two hardline communist capitals he added 
with its lack of support evident the party is looking to 
bolster itself by drawing solidarity into a grand coalition 
solidarity insists it wants to remain in opposition but the 
political weakness of the party makes that seem more and more 
difficult because of its numbers in the senate and sejm and its 
mass popular support the independent union will have a huge say in 
policy and appointments 
for instance no legislation will be able to get through the new 
national assembly without solidarity votes the senate has a veto 
over all bills and the party lacks enough votes in the sjm to 
override the veto 
there is also the question of naming a new president and forming 
a new government after the new sejm and senate are seated 
theoretically rakowski could keep his post despite having been 
denied a parliament seat but it might be difficult for him to 
function effectively as prime minister after such a loss of face 
and there likely will be calls for someone more popular with the 
voters to head the government 
similarly the sejm and senate are to meet together to name a 
president a newly created executive office with strong powers 
under polands revamped constitution that was designed to be a 
bulwark to keep poland in the soviet bloc 
the presidential election was supposed to be a walkaway for 
polish party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski because of the partys 
builtin majority in the sejm but if the national list seats 
are still vacant when the vote is taken the party will have only a 
small threevote edge 
there have been popular calls for solidarity leader lech walesa 
to offer himself as the oppositions candidate such calls are only 
likely to increase given the solidarity election performance 
president walesa such strange things are starting to look 
possible now that poland has started down the road of democracy

the accomplishments of the 100th congress will remain forever a 
monument to your leadership 
and to the great leaders of the republican party gerald ford 
who left this place to assume the presidency as a healing president 
in a difficult time in our history john rhodes and bob michel 
and all of my colleagues past and present whose vision of the 
country though sometimes sharply different was marked by a common 
commitment to public service shared concern for improving the 
common good and a love of this house 
we are proud to call this the peoples house the fundamental 
institution of american democracy 
although it is not the oldest parliament in the world it has 
existed longer as an independent popularly elected legislature than 
any other parliamentary body in history 
as we watch the remarkable struggle of people in china and the 
growing aspirations of the people in the soviet union poland and 
elsewhere to take control of their destiny we should take great 
pride that the values that gave this institution its birth and which 
have flourished here and sustained us for two centuries now sweep 
around the world 
this body reflects most closely the nation at large 
it is not as many have suggested a fixed stagnant body 
it is constantly refreshed by new members from every corner of 
the country who have brought their ideas and energy to bear on 
behalf of the people they represent 
only 7 percent of the houses current members were in the house 
when i was first elected in 1964 
eightyone percent of the current members have been elected since 
1974 
more than half of the current members 55 percent have been 
elected since 1980 
the constant change in membership is a source of great strength 
for the house but fundamentally and more importantly the house 
reflects the will of the electorate 
our business here is the peoples business 
it is time to put divisiveness behind us to reach out and 
address the issues of national policy that members of both parties 
are eager to consider

we must resolve to build support for schools that nourish the 
love of learning and are free from drugs and violence 
we must deal with the problem of homelessness 
we must strive to put the country at the cutting edge of economic 
innovation and the global economy 
we must provide for the security of families from child care to 
health care 
in a time of changing and uncertain circumstances we must assure 
our continued national security 
we must solve our fiscal problems and protect the national and 
global environment 
on these and other important public issues we must act 
responsibly and resolutely 
we will not reach any of these goals without a deep respect for 
the house as an institution and a reaffirmation of the value of 
public service 
i have been a member of the house for 25 years 
i take great pride as we all do in my profession 
election to public office is a free gift of a free people 
the challenge for all of us in public life is to use that gift to 
improve the conditions of those who have bestowed that enormous 
trust and responsibility upon us 
we must take pride in ourselves and in our institution 
i am confident in the fundamental honesty and dedication of the 
members of the house 
the members of the house today meet and exceed standards of 
personal conduct that are higher than at any time in our history 
i recognize that controversy still exists in some areas and will 
address them 
i have asked bob michel to join me in asking the bipartisan task 
force on ethics to complete their work with deliberate speed so that 
the house can consider these issues in this congress in this 
session in this year 
the greatness of the house comes from its members working 
collectively to address the nations problems 
no parliamentary body can survive for long without the basic 
comity and trust necessary for us to address the nations problems 
in a constructive way 
i do not believe we can successfully undertake our public 
responsibility by tearing down this house by abusing its 
institutions 
we cannot tolerate the continuance of the current distrust and 
suspicion and expect to fulfill the publics expectations 
after 25 years in the house there should be no doubt that i am 
proud to be a democrat 
i am deeply conscious however of the obligation i bear as 
speaker of the house 
i am speaker of the whole house not of one party but to each 
and every member of the house undivided by the center aisle 
i pledge to protect the right and privileges of all members 
i will seek the consultation advice and counsel of leaders and 
members and i will welcome expressions of concern from all quarters 
of the house 
i have suggested to the republican leader that we meet more 
frequently to discuss business 
he has encouraged more orderly and early cooperation on 
developing the weekly program and i welcome that suggestion 
together we reiterate our commitment to the work of the ethics 
task force so that we can put this divisive period behind us

politics involves the clash of ideas and we will inevitably have 
disagreements 
we must be careful that our desire for comity and bipartisanship 
does not deter us from considering contentious issues and debating 
them vigorously 
but we must be able to conduct our political battles in an 
environment of respect for ourselves for our opponents and for the 
house 
we cannot allow political differences to become foils for 
personal antagonism 
let us debate and decide with intensity even passionate 
intensity but let us debate and decide with respect not rancor 
a dozen years ago speaker thomas p oneill stood before the 
house prepared to take the oath of office for the first time 
in his speech he paraphrased certain principles outlined by the 
great henry clay that should guide the speaker 
he promised to be prompt and impartial in deciding parliamentary 
questions 
he pledged to be patient goodtempered and courteous toward 
individual members 
he pledged best to employ the talent of the house for full and 
fair consideration of issues that come before us 
he pledged in those moments of agitation from which no 
deliberative assembly is entirely exempt to remain cool and 
unshaken guarding the permanent laws and rules of the house from 
being sacrificed to temporary passions prejudices or interests 
i repeat that pledge to you today 
you have bestowed upon me a great honor and a great 
responsibility 
i will devote every ability i have to maintaining your confidence 
and the integrity of the house of representatives and to protect the 
rights and welfare of all members so that we can fulfill our high 
responsibility in representing the people of this nation 
with gods help and with your understanding and support i am 
now prepared to take the oath of office

the house turned over authority with 
handshakes and backslaps with wisecracks and children in the 
members benches tuesday giving its new leader a chance to draw a 
contrast with moscow and warsaw and the streets of beijing 
there were still bitter partisan words spoken in the lobbies of 
a house whose wounds have not yet healed but thomas s foleys 
cordial assumption of power as speaker and jim wrights surrender 
were cited by foley himself as symbolic of the values of the house 
we are proud to call this the peoples house he said 
taking note of the street struggle in china and the grasping for 
democratic formulas in poland and the soviet union he said america 
could draw satisfaction that the values that gave this 
institution its birth and which have flourished here and sustained 
us for two centuries now sweep the world 
the house does these things its own way with a mixture of rigid 
ceremony and its customary oldshoe clubbiness 
a voice familiar from state of the union night bellowed out 
mr speaker the speakerelect thomas s foley of the state of 
washington the doors parted and foley marched down the handshake 
route 
wright having surrendered the speakership left the dais and 
joined the democratic ranks along the way he passed six children 
members kids here for the history of it all one of them trying 
out his sunglasses against the bright lights and another twirling a 
sailors cap 
wright accused of ethical impropriety announced last week that 
he was innocent but quitting a victim of mindless cannibalism 
at foleys instigation wright accepted a standing ovation his 
eyes glistened 
republican robert michel of illinois made a joke of his own 
inevitable defeat for the speakership the republicans dutifully 
nominated him the democrats nominated foley the reading clerk 
called out the names the republicans voted for michel and the 
democrats for foley who won 251 to 164 
when the outcome was announced michel said he had become 
distressingly expert at having been outvoted in these 
speakership elections it was his sixth and he hoped for the day 
when the democrats might be in the minority and learn the joys of 
such selfish behavior 
the democrats have been in the majority for 35 years michel 
said serious now and so long a stretch of uninterrupted power 
can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and 
comity 
moreover he said the distingushed members of the ethics 
committee who had been about to pass judgment on wright when he 
shortcircuited the process are neither mindless nor 
cannibals wright had spoken of mindless cannibalism in his 
resignation speech last week 
so not far from the surface rancor remained 
at the republican caucus which had nominated him michel urged 
rejection of two possible republican courses toward the democrats 
the kiss and makeup alternative and the french revolution 
alternative in which we knit the names of evil democrats into a 
waiting list for the political guillotine 
from the back of the room some junior members replied 
musically they hummed loudly the french marseillaise 
nor did the days sweetness suppress the democrats ire some 
democrats aver the republicans are engaging in ethics wars 
which so far have forced wright out forced tony coelho of 
california the partys zealous whip to quit rather than face an 
ethics investigation and spread suspicions about another rising 
democrat william h gray iii of pennsylvania whose memorial day 
visit by fbi agents quickly found its way into the newspapers 
rep barney frank dmass told reporters leaking such news was 
unjustified character assassination rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo accused gop national chairman lee atwater of spreading 
venom while in the white house was george bush being kind and 
gentle george saying lets do horseshoeing lets do 
barbecues

the chinese media all but ceased to function 
tuesday with no mention of a deepening crisis in the national 
leadership or of fighting between military units 
the xinhua news agency usually the mouthpiece of government 
policy issued no chinese news restricting itself to a few dozen 
foreign stories and fixtures such as weather forecasts 
previously xinhua used its reports to convey the official line 
on the weeks of student protests the agencys silence seemed to 
indicate that neither the conservatives who ordered saturdays 
military crackdown nor the liberals who opposed it are in a position 
to dictate a new line 
the nationally televised evening news was narrated entirely by 
offscreen voices with no anchor and even skipped the usual 
introduction viewers this is the news broadcast these are the 
main stories 
much of the 30minute newscast was taken up by timeless feature 
stories from other cities it also replayed a video from traffic 
monitors at several intersections in the city showing stonethrowing 
and other attacks by civilians against troops arriving to enforce 
martial law there were no shots of troops firing on civilians 
the only substantial news from television or any other official 
media tuesday was a statement by state council spokesman yuan mu 
that nearly 300 people had died and more than 7000 were injured 
staterun television also said 32 people were arrested most for 
allegedly attempting to set fire to buses 
yuan was shown sitting at a desk facing several rows of local 
officials in a small meeting room the first look inside the 
government since saturday 
the television later broadcast a news conference by yuan with 
chinese journalists in which he urged them to do their work well 
even though newspapers have not been distributed since saturday his 
comment implied that some newspapers continued to print editions 
even though they were not being delivered or sold on the street 
china central television did not broadcast its daily 
englishlanguage newscast on monday or tuesday night and all 
stations ended their programming early 
telephone calls to television stations went unanswered 
many chinese reporters had closely followed the weeks of student 
prodemocracy protests that led to the may 20 declaration of martial 
law and saturday military attack but since saturday none have been 
seen on the streets

house republican leader robert michel on 
tuesday turned a normally ceremonial goodwill gesture toward the 
new speaker into a scolding for the majority democrats 
thomas s foley dwash was elected speaker to replace jim 
wright dtexas who resigned rather than continue his battle 
against charges that he violated house rules on outside income 
michel carried forth the tradition of introducing foley to the 
house and then took it a step further reflecting increasing 
frustration and pressure within republican ranks after more than a 
third of a century of democratic control 
thirtyfive years of uninterrupted power can act like a 
corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity said 
michel whose name was futilely put in nomination by the gop for 
the sixth time 
the crisis in the house was not the fault of jim wright or as 
wright contended in his resignation speech to mindless 
cannibalism michel said 
it is a catchy phrase but the distinguished members of the 
ethics committee which charged wright are neither mindless 
nor cannibals he said 
i am all for putting an end to bitterness michel said i 
am all in favor of putting our house in order but we dont do so 
by sweeping things under the rug 
when he finished hammering the democrats michel handed foley 
the gavel

archbishop desmond tutu said tuesday 
he was anguished by the failure of his fellow anglican clergymen to 
allow women to become priests and he likened sex discrimination to 
apartheid 
tutu the first black to lead the anglican church in southern 
africa commented during a meeting of church officials 
during a vote saturday 60 percent of the delegates approved the 
ordination of women but this fell short of the twothirds majority 
needed to change church rules 
tutu said tuesday the outcome had caused him very deep anguish 
and pain 
i am very deeply convinced about the rightness of the 
ordination of women he said i believe it especially in view of 
my own ministry in seeking to work for justice 
i cant see how i can say i oppose apartheid because it refuses 
to give access to people because of something they cant change and 
then say no to women 
under apartheid the white minority government refuses to allow 
south africas black majority a vote in national affairs and 
maintains segregated schools hospitals and residential areas

republicans boycotted a senate foreign 
relations committee meeting tuesday to protest a democraticled 
probe into the background and truthfulness of donald gregg 
president bushs choice as ambassador to south korea 
the investigations focus is greggs possible link to the 
irancontra affair the key questions did gregg assist oliver l 
norths secret mission to illegally resupply the nicaraguan contra 
rebels and is he lying about it now 
democrats said they may fight the boycott by holding up bushs 
nominations to fill key state department and diplomatic posts 
as the new tensions surfaced in a longsimmering dispute the 
absence of gop members prevented the committee from acting on a 
45 billion state department authorization bill also pending was 
a 115 billion twoyear foreign aid authorization measure 
gregg the target of the committees investigation served as 
bushs vice presidential national security adviser 
on tuesday eight democrats gathered to discuss the state 
department bill the only republican who showed up was sen jesse 
helms of north carolina the panels ranking gop member and he 
walked out a quorum of 10 members is necessary to permit the 
committee to act on pending legislation or nominations 
its very apparent that we are unable to do business that the 
republicans are objecting to the fact that a legitimate committee 
inquiry is taking place into donald gregg said sen john kerry 
dmass 
complaining of wholesale boycott kerry told his democratic 
colleagues i would hope the comity of this institution would not 
lead to legitimate business being held up 
sen alan cranston dcalif who is leading the gregg 
investigation complained that a lack of cooperation from the 
administration is in itself delaying final action on gregg 
late last month i sent several letters to administration 
officials asking for documents and information relating to gregg 
cranston said i not only have received no material i have 
received no response 
helms said that the boycott is being organized by sen mitch 
mcconnell rky who helms said wants a specific date set for 
holding another hearing on gregg and a specific date for voting on 
his nomination 
i dont want anyone suggesting were holding up anything 
helms said weve got a vendetta going on against mr gregg 
thats been clear from the beginning 
this is an attempt to dredge up irancontra said helms 
im having a problem on my side because of their discontent over 
what senator cranston is doing 
at that point chairman claiborne pell dri attempted to 
move for action on the pending measure 
helms stood up 
ill see you later mr chairman he said ive got to 
defend my side 
helms then walked from the room 
after huddling with democratic members cranston told reporters 
that if republicans want delay they are likely to get it 
we may not determine anything for awhile cranston said 
this committee may not have any hearings on anything including 
gregg if this committee cant meet on anything else maybe the 
committee also cant meet on gregg 
the white house and state department have been urging quick 
actions on a nummber of the pending nominations including those of 
bernard aronson to be assistant secretary of state for latin 
american affairs and john kelly to be assistant secretary of middle 
eastern and south asian affairs 
pell complained that nominations confirmed to date have been 
done so with little or no help from republicans 
we have to carry water for the administration pell said 
their own side is not carrying water

a proposal to collect the names of new yorkers 
infected with the aids virus was condemned tuesday by gay rights 
groups and the aclu as a move that could turn those needing help 
away from medical attention 
our feeling is that anonymity has been the cornerstone of 
success in aids strategy in new york city no matter which direction 
the epidemic goes that should not be changed said clarissa 
cunningham spokeswoman for the gay mens health crisis 
if it is it will drive people underground away from the 
health care that they need 
ms cunningham cited statistics from south carolina as backing 
her assertion after the state required the health department 
receive the name of anyone testing positive for the aids virus the 
number of tests dropped 50 percent 
under the plan proposed monday by city health commissioner dr 
stephen joseph the city would collect the names of people testing 
positive for the virus in order to contact sexual partners or people 
who shared needles 
new york is now one of eight states where anonymous records are 
kept of people who test positive 
josephs proposal made at the fifth annual aids international 
conference in montreal prompted members of the aids coalition to 
unleash power to disrupt his speech by standing with their backs 
toward him and screaming that the commissioner was a liar and 
murderer 
you are going to drive us underground act up member peter 
staley shouted at joseph during an exchange at the conference 
while joseph said he felt confidentiality could be protected 
william rubenstein of the american civil liberties union said his 
group has been opposed to such namecollecting plans since they were 
first proposed 
the problem with keeping lists is the potential for 
confidentiality violations and possible prejudicial treatment these 
are our civil liberties concerns said rubenstein 
josephs plan received endorsement tuesday from city council 
health commission chairman joseph lisa who called the proposal an 
extremely responsible public health measure 
this will go a significant way to protecting the public 
especially women in the city of new york who are being infected at a 
four times greater rate than heterosexual men said lisa

sailors on the battleship uss iowa said 
tuesday they are ready to return to sea even though navy 
investigators have not found the cause of a gun turret explosion 
that killed 47 crewmen in april 
wed like to shoot those guns said rick a fire control 
crewman aboard the battleship its like falling off that horse 
youve got to get back on it the longer you wait the more youre 
going to think about it 
lt cmdr brad goforth a ship spokesman asked that crewmens 
last names not be used because the ship may run into danger during 
its cruise to the mediterranean sea 
rick and seven other iowa crewmen and spouses took a break from 
preparing for a sixmonth deployment that begins wednesday to talk 
at the norfolk naval station 
the crewmen and the spouses were in good spirits about the 
deployment the ships first since the april 19 explosion in gun 
turret no 2 killed 47 crewmen during a training exercise 
the wives that ive spoken with are very supportive of this 
deployment possibly even more so than ordinarily said becky 
wife of the ships senior chief 
deployments are hard whether an accidents been involved or 
not said kathy who stood at a pier beside the ship with her 
husband michael a machinists mate second class 
michael an iowa crewmen for four years said the crews morale 
was fairly good 
ive seen it higher but its not too bad he said weve 
got a lot of work to do we dont have time to sit and mope about 
what happened 
along with the usual preparations for six months at sea the iowa 
crew had to clean and make minor repairs to the no 2 turret that 
turret must undergo about 13 million worth of repairs at the 
norfolk naval shipyard in portsmouth after the ship returns before 
its 16inch guns can be fired the navy said 
the ships other 16inch guns also will not be fired until the 
navy completes its investigation of the accident the iowa will be 
able to use its six fiveinch guns and surfacetosurface missiles 
the no 2 turret will be used during the cruise to train new 
crewmen who replaced the sailors who died in the explosion goforth 
said 
the crewmen said they have discussed the various theories about 
the explosion that have appeared in the news media including 
reports that one of the turret crewmen may have caused the explosion 
to commit suicide 
youre going to have a lot of talk said doug a petty 
officer 2nd class its just something that we just put out of our 
minds and we just go about our daily work but you cant forget and 
youve got to wonder yourself too

the food and drug administration said tuesday 
it planned a 50fold reduction in the amount of lead permitted to 
reach beverages from ceramic pitchers because of new evidence that 
extremely small amounts of lead can hurt children 
lead at concentrations tolerable by adults can limit body growth 
and intelligence of children and can cause brain damage and behavior 
problems 
lead in pitchers comes from the glaze commonly used to make 
ceramics smooth and impervious 
officials are most concerned about acidic liquids like orange 
juice eating away at the glaze and causing lead to leach small 
cream pitchers would not be subject to the new standard since they 
are not used for acidic liquids 
the fda is proposing to allow pitchers to be sold only if they 
leach no more than 01 micrograms or onetenth of a millionth of a 
gram of lead per milliliter of an acidic test solution currently 
pitchers are allowed to leach up to 5 micrograms of lead per 
millileter 
the proposal also would require that highlead decorative and 
commemorative ceramic plates have fired into them a permanent 
warning that cautions not for food use may poison food or 
have holes so they cant be used for food 
the current standard was set by fda in 1979 based on 
recommendations of the world health organization however as a 
result of the recent studies the federal centers for disease 
control and the who have reduced their recommended maximum levels 
the proposed regulation was published in the federal register 
last thursday after a 60day comment period the fda will issue 
final rules

several house republicans and a democratic 
subcommittee chairman united tuesday behind an attempt to save 
owners of 150 to 240 savings and loan facilities billions of 
dollars in a bailout of the industry 
the effort was aimed at weakening legislation demanded by 
president bush and pushed through several committees by liberal 
democrats to make sampl owners put 64 billion more of their own 
money at risk as a price for the 143 billion bailout the biggest 
in the nations history 
of 10 proposals to reduce the amount of new capital that sampls 
would have to raise an amendment by rep henry hyde rill 
appeared headed toward becoming the vehicle for opposing bushs 
plan when the bill reaches the house floor next week 
of the amendments that deal with that issue i think it is the 
most precise said rep charles pashayan jr rcalif a member 
of the house rules committee 
the committee spent most of tuesday deciding which of 109 
offered amendments will be allowed to be taken up when the full 
house debates and votes on the 290page bill another meeting was 
scheduled for wednesday 
in addition to the capital standards the rules panel was 
expected to approve floor consideration of an amendment by the ways 
and means committee to add the 50 billion immediate taxpayer share 
of the bailouts cost to the federal budget deficit for the next 
three years 
bush has proposed financing the government share of the bailout 
through longterm capital bonds that would add only 45 billion in 
interest costs to the deficit in fiscal 1989 1990 and 1991 and 
administration officials have vowed to recommend that he veto any 
measure that tampers with the financing 
republicans also were demanding floor votes on amendments to 
undo a pair of administrationopposed housing measures added to 
bushs package by the house banking committee 
one would make sampls subsidize lowincome home mortgages by 75 
million to 150 million a year the other would give poor families 
first crack at buying some of the tens of billions of dollars in 
residential property that has fallen into the governments hands as 
the result of defaults on loans by insolvent thrift institutions 
both of the housing measures as well as making the bailouts 
costs part of the federal deficit were rejected by the senate 
which passed its version of the bill in april 
other amendments appeared headed for floor votes in the house 
included putting a cap on government borrowing for the bailout and 
restoring proposed 1 millionaday civil penalites for bank fraud 
and other sampl crimes 
bush had demanded the 1 million civil penalties to discourage 
fraud and embezzlement which has been blamed by government 
officials for more than half of the estimated 100 billion in sampl 
losses over the past five years 
however in response to an intense lobbying effort by the 
american bankers association and other trade groups the house 
judiciary committee two weeks ago amended the bill to allow civil 
damages of only twice what the government has lost as a result of 
the wrongdoing 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the financial 
institutions subcommittee of the house banking committee 
complained that bankers and other financial officers will be able 
to escape civil fines for fraud if examiners catch them at it 
before the losses become severe 
how can we favor almost meaningless penalties for financial 
crooks annunzio said seeking a floor vote on an amendment to 
restore bushs proposal 
but the biggest fight was over the capital requirements and on 
that issue annunzio was at the forefront with several house 
republicans in endorsing hydes amendment to weaken bushs plan 
hydes proposal would make the government go through lengthy 
judicial hearings before requiring newcash infusions from 241 sampls 
granted socalled supervisory good will exemptions from capital 
standards in the early 1980s 
the exemptions some extending for as long as up to 40 years 
were granted to thenhealthy sampls for taking over failing thrifts 
at the governments request the purpose was to preserve the 
solvency of the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
guarantees depositors against losses up to 100000 each 
this policy saved the american taxpayers over 13 billion at 
the time said hyde he added that virtually everyone agrees 
that these mergers never would have taken place but for the fact 
that good will was part of the bargain due process and fundamental 
fairness are concepts that cannot be tossed aside simply because of 
the latest crisis 
however supporters of bushs plan to make sampl owners put up 
their own money as a cushion between possible future losses and 
the governments deposit insurance funds said good will has no 
cash value 
you cannot count air has hard cash and good will is just 
air said rep henry gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house 
banking committee

two major studies of the airline industry put 
radically different slants on the impact of airline hub operations 
on competition and air fares 
a study by the general accounting office to be released at a 
senate hearing wednesday says airlines charge an average of 27 
percent more per passenger mile on flights to and from 15 major hub 
airports than at other airports included in the study the 
associated press obtained an advance copy of the study 
but a study by the airline industry released tuesday says average 
airline fares have decreased since deregulation of the industry in 
1978 and fares at 30 hub airports are only 15 percent above the 
industry average that study says hub fares are a little higher 
primarily because hubs tend to have more nonstop flights 
both studies are to be discussed on wednesday at a hearing of the 
commerce science and trasporation subcommittee on aviation which 
is examining the airline practice of feeding many of their flights 
through a single airport 
the study by the gao which is the investigative arm of congress 
concludes the trend that has seen major airlines dominating flights 
at airports where they set up hub operations has decreased 
competition 
many travelers have less choice among airlines as more markets 
are being controlled by a single airline the study says 
the report says that although the number of destinations served 
from hub airports studied increased 10 percent between may 1985 and 
may 1988 most of the increases were by dominant carriers and were 
offset by large service reductions by other carriers 
at 13 of the 15 hubs studied average air fares per passenger 
mile were higher for dominant carriers than for other airlines 
serving the same airports the report said 
hubbing generates important operating efficiencies but it can 
also lead to substantial market power for the airlines which could 
lead to higher fares and reduced levels of service gao official 
kenneth m mead said in testimony prepared for the subcommittee 
hearing 
the industry study conducted by the aviation consulting firm of 
simat helliesen amp eichner concludes that competition in individual 
markets has increased despite the greater concentration within the 
industry and at some airports 
the study commissioned by the air transport association which 
represents major airlines concludes there is little if any 
relationship between average fares and airline concentraiton at 
either hub or nonhub airports 
the hub and spoke system has evolved into a highly competitive 
national transportation system which provides enormous benefits to 
the american public said robert aaronson ata president 
the ata study says better service such as more nonstop flights 
account for average fare levels at some hubs that are higher than 
the industry average 
but in analysing the study the association said passengers are 
not hostage to the higher fares because cheaper options are 
available including multistop flights or connecting flights 
airline schedules at 25 nonhub airports show they are now served 
by nearly twice as many airlines as in 1978 when the airline 
industry was deregulated the ata study said 
the ata study includes charts which show that in 1978 nearly half 
of all airline passengers traveled in markets where a single carrier 
had 70 percent or more of the flights but in 1988 only 20 percent 
of passengers traveled in markets that were served by only one 
airline 
the growth of the number of hubs and the expansion of service 
at them have had astonishingly beneficial consequences for the 
typical spoke community the ata said

ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis political 
will read to irans parliament sternly criticized the united 
states as a vile state terrorist and said irans leaders must be 
concerned with serving islam and the deprived 
khomeinis son ahmad read excerpts monday on tehran radio on 
tuesday state television broadcast film of president ali khamenei 
reading the testament to parliament on sunday khamenei was chosen 
sunday as caretaker leader 
it was not known whether khamenei read the entire 29page 
document which official media said was dated feb 15 1983 with 
another page added in 1987 they did not say what was contained in 
the extra page 
those parts of the will made public said nothing of who should 
govern iran but contained general observations on how to choose the 
leaders 
my will to the leadership is that they should occupy themselves 
with serving islam the islamic republic the oppressed and the 
deprived khamenei read 
they should not think that leadership is an egotistical gift 
it is a heavy dangerous responsibility if the experts in 
choosing a leadership council or leader consult with prominent 
theologians and independent scholars many problems will not 
arise 
there has been speculation that in the absence of a single 
political figure of khomeinis stature iran may be ruled by a 
collective leadership 
the testament said the president and members of the parliament 
should come from a class that has felt the deprivation of the 
oppressed and will work to better their conditions not from the 
welloff capitalists and landlords drowned in pleasures and 
excesses 
earlier official media carried these excerpts 
i have done my duty which is to give guidance my hope is that 
you will listen to this advice which will reach you after my death 
and is unstained by the desire for power and save yourself from 
gods wrath 
there should be no doubt that the islamic revolution of iran is 
separate from all other revolutions in the quality of its struggle 
and in its motives 
i have not said and i will not say that today in this 
republic the great islam and all its aspects are being implemented 
and that ignorant and disorderly individuals are not committing acts 
against islamic laws 
but what i do say is that the legislative judicial and 
executive branches are trying and will try to do a great deal to 
make the country islamic 
it is better to be wiped out honorably from the face of history 
by the hands of criminal americans and soviets than to have a 
supercomfortable life under the red flag of the east and the black 
flag of the west khomeini declared 
he said iran had no greater source of pride than the fact that 
the us with all its huge military arsenal and string of puppet 
regimes and the international mass media at its service has been so 
disgraced and humbled against iran that it does not know to whom it 
should resort 
khmomeini said iran should guard against the conspiracies and 
plots of the enemies towards the islamic republic in the forefront 
of these is america this vile state terrorist which has set fire 
to the whole world and its ally the global zionist israel which 
to attain its goals commits such crimes that pens are ashamed to 
document and tongues are ashamed to recite 
of iraqi president saddam hussein his foe in an eightyear war 
and some arab leaders who supported iraq he said 
we are proud that our enemy is saddam whom friends and foes 
alike recognize as criminal and violator of international and human 
rights and everyone knows that his treachery to the nation of iraq 
and the gulf sheikdoms is not less than his treachery to the 
iranian nation 
the islamic countries and the oppressed of the world are proud 
that their enemies are this jordanian hussein the carpetbagger and 
hassan and hosni mubarak are followers of israel the criminal 
his references were to the kings of jordan and morocco and the 
president of egypt

president bush visited the soviet embassy on 
tuesday to express sympathy for victims of the deadly gas explosion 
along the transsiberian railway and to offer a team of us burn 
specialists 
bush told soviet ambassador yuri dubinin that the united states 
could send a team of 14 doctors from the brooke army hospital at 
fort sam houston in san antonio texas one of the nations most 
respected burn centers 
i just want you to know its available they could be ready 
to go immediately bush told dubinin the ambassador thanked bush 
for the generous offer and said he would relay it at once to 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
youve had more than your share of terrible luck bush told 
dubinin mentioning both the freak weekend gas explosion in the ural 
mountains and the devastating earthquake earlier this year in soviet 
armenia 
at least 190 people died 762 were hospitalized and another 250 
were missing in the sunday incident in which two passenger trains 
were engulfed by a wall of fire from a ruptured gas pipeline 
according to tass the soviet news agency 
bush told dubinin that the soviets could take or decline the team 
of burn specialists as they wished this is an offer and it may or 
may not be something you would want to accept in the final 
analysis bush said 
he said he knew the soviet union had its own burn specialists 
but he said the fort sam houston unit was an outstanding burn 
center 
bush said the offer included bringing some worst cases if it 
fits your requirements to san antonio 
bush sat at a table covered with red cloth and bordered by black 
ribbons in an upstairs room at the embassy with dubinin looking 
on he wrote in the guest book with sympathy please convey our 
most sincere condolences george bush 6 june 89 
bush and national security adviser brent scowcroft also looked at 
an exhibit of photographs from the gas explosion 
before heading back to the white house bush met privately with 
dubinin for about 10 minutes

the soviet union has bought an additional 
400000 metric tons of us corn and sorghum for delivery this year 
under a longterm agreement the agriculture department said tuesday 
the grain 300000 tons of corn and 100000 tons of sorghum is 
scheduled for delivery through aug 31 sales were handled by 
private exporters under terms of the current longterm grain supply 
agreement between the two countries 
moscows grain purchases have been at record levels for weeks 
far surpassing chinas recent buying surge 
officials said the latest sales boosted total us corn and wheat 
sales to the soviets in 198889 to a record 205 million tons 
including more than 159 million tons of corn and 46 million tons 
of wheat 
the sales also include 442500 tons of soybeans 135 million 
tons of soybean meal and more than 1 million tons of grain sorghum 
china meanwhile was the american wheat farmers leading foreign 
buyer in the 198889 marketing year with purchases of about 83 
million tons in addition china has bought about 29 million tons 
of us wheat for delivery in the 198990 marketing year that began 
june 1 including 18 million tons announced by usda on monday 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 300000 tons of 
corn sold to the soviets would be about 118 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 249 per bushel at the 
farm level according to the latest usda fiveday average meaning 
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around 29 million 
the sorghum also at 394 bushels per ton recently has been 
about 220 per bushel and would be worth approximately 87 million 
wheat sales to the soviet union have been subsidized under the 
departments export enhancement program or eep but the corn and 
other commodities are not subsidized 
china had been a regular wheat buyer under eep but has not bought 
any under the subsidy program since april 6 when 300000 tons were 
reported for delivery in the 198990 marketing year said jean 
nollmeyer of the departments foreign agricultural service 
but since then she said china has bought about 26 million tons 
of wheat for 198990 delivery all of that has been at nonsubsidy 
prices even though china still has about 910000 tons remaining in 
its eep account 
world grain prices have risen significantly in the last year 
resulting in lower us subsidy rates at one time under eep the 
wheat subsidy was more than 40 per ton or around 108 per bushel 
in chinas most recent eep deal the subsidy was 633 per ton or 
about 17 cents per bushel

imprisoned black leader nelson 
mandela was allowed a visit tuesday from govan mbeki the 
highestranking african national congress member at liberty in south 
africa 
mbeki 78 received unexpected permission for the visit after 
being turned down several times since his release from prison in 
november 1987 
it is not known what the veteran black nationalists discussed 
because mbeki is barred from being quoted by the press no other 
source of information was available 
mbeki spent about 2 hours at victor verster prison farm in 
paarl outside cape town but the exact length of his meeting with 
south africas most popular leader was not disclosed the two last 
met shortly before mbeki was freed 
they were among eight african national congress leaders sentenced 
to life imprisonment in 1964 for plotting to sabotage the government 
farida omar an antiapartheid activist from cape town said she 
was with mbeki when he received a telephone call tuesday morning 
informing him the visit had been approved 
he was very thrilled she said 
rumors of mandelas possible release have been circulating in 
south africa for more than a decade and the government gives no 
firm indication of its plans however the decision last year to 
move him to a suburbanstyle ranch house on a prison farm revealed 
the special status he has even as an inmate 
mandela 70 has refused offers of freedom on condition he 
renounces the use of violence in the fight to topple the whiteled 
government 
there is speculation that mandela may be released after national 
elections in september for whites indians and people of mixedrace 
the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs 
mbeki was freed unconditionally because he was ailing but a 
month later was placed under harsh restrictions prohibiting him from 
leaving his hometown of port elizabeth without permission he has 
been allowed periodic visits to cape town for medical treatment

the worlds largest prefabricated power plant 
began a slow journey tuesday under tow up the mississippi river the 
same body of water that it eventually will use to generate 
electricity 
cables groaned when two tugboats in front pulled and two tugs in 
back pushed the massive power plant the merrimac off a dry dock at 
a suburban new orleans shipyard to begin its 208mile journey 
upriver 
i feel real good ive been working on this thing for 13 years 
we started literally from scratch said sidney murray of 
catalystold river hydroelectric ltd one of the investors its 
been exciting for everybody 
murray videotaped the 12story beige structure as it edged away 
from its dock about 75 spectators cheered from the dock 
the power plant is 12 stories high 456 feet long and weighs 
about 25000 tons company officials said that although the merrimac 
is smaller than some of the worlds largest ships it is believed to 
be the largest structure to ever travel up the mississippi river 
the merrimac is headed for a point 40 miles south of vidalia 
where it will be fitted for operation in a channel where water will 
run from the mississippi river through the power plant turbines and 
into the atchafalaya river 
louisianas first hydroelectric plant should be fully operational 
by july 1 1990 said bill fox of ebasco an engineering firm that 
worked on the 500 million project 
the merrimac will creep upriver at 2 to 4 mph and should arrive 
in northeast louisiana over the weekend he said 
this is a major milestone fox said its been thought out 
extremely well saving anything less than a hurricane we ought to 
be able to bring it in without any trouble 
the major obstacle is already anticipated the us highway 190 
bridge at baton rouge the bridge is too low for the tall structure 
so the plant must be partially submerged while it passes underneath 
the merrimac will probably be sunk 40 to 50 feet to leave a 
clearance of at least five feet between the top of the plant and the 
bottom of the bridge 
the 10 to 20hour process will be done by pumping water into 
large hollow compartments that enable the structure to float after 
the plant clears the bridge the water will be pumped out and the 
merrimac will resume its journey 
once in place near the old river control structure the merrimac 
will divert water from the mississippi river through eight giant 
turbines the water will then flow through a twomilelong channel 
into the atchafalaya river a 17foot drop 
the plant is designed to generate 192 megawatts of electricity 
enough to light a city of 200000 people 
owners of the power plant are the merrimac corp of new york and 
dominion capital inc of virginia the town of vidalia shared 
licensing for the project

war between christian army units and a a moslem alliance of syrian 
troops and druse militiamen no casualties were reported 
we declare obedience to ayatollah ali khamenei and swear 
absolute commitment to his teachings and orders said a statement 
issued by the proiranian hezbollah or party of god hezbollah is 
the umbrella group for militant shiites believed to be holding some 
of the 18 foreigners missing in lebanon 
the rival amal faction a more moderate group backed by syria 
said it supports and blesses the islamic republic in its correct 
selection of the great successor ayatollah ali khamenei 
khamenei is only a middleranking cleric but is being called 
ayatollah since his choice by the assembly of experts 
established by khomeini to handle the succession

elderly americans are being ripped off by 
representatives appointed to handle their social security checks a 
senate panel was told tuesday but lawmakers and the bush 
administration disagreed on how to reform the system 
an arkansas woman and a california woman misused social security 
payments that they had been entrusted to manage on behalf of elderly 
beneficiaries the senate special committee on aging was told at a 
hearing 
elizabeth freeland of sacramento calif testified that she was 
told by the government that she needed a representative to handle 
her disability benefits because she was incapable of managing the 
money herself 
but she said the woman who was appointed kept some of the 
benefits for herself and had a history of writing bad checks she 
did not identify the woman 
a similar story was told by mary miller of marvell ark who 
said her representative collected her disability benefits then 
refused to use the money to buy a telephone clothes or other 
necessities that miller requested 
she often would not tell me how much money she would have of 
mine or what was going on miller said 
about 46 million social security beneficiaries have mental or 
physical impairments serious enough that they require a payee to 
manage their benefits 
the social security administration accepts applications from 
anyone who wants to be a payee but gives preference to relatives or 
to public or private groups with good records in handling elderly 
affairs 
but sens david pryor dark and john heinz rpa said the 
government has been too lax in overseeing the program 
there is some evidence that ssa has not been keeping a close 
watch on those who apply to be representative payees heinz said 
presently the ssa does not do background checks nor does the ssa 
monitor the program to ensure that the beneficiaries actually 
receive their money 
louis enoff an ssa deputy commissioner said the administration 
recognized there was a problem and was evaluating steps to remedy 
it he said the victims represent a small percentage of often poor 
uneducated or handicapped people who are without relatives to care 
for them 
enoff said ssa verifies the identities of payee applicants and 
asks them whether they have felony convictions 
he said he was concerned about a bill introduced by pryor and 
heinz on tuesday that would require ssa to conduct criminal 
background checks on applicants while barring most creditors from 
becoming payees 
a ban on creditors would be too stringent and would keep for 
example helpful landlords from becoming payees enoff said 
still other possible safeguards in the bill are not yet feasible 
he said 
ultimately we plan to automate pertinent data on payee 
applicants including past misuse activity and felony convictions 
but the extent to which this can be done requires further 
investigation analysis and systems development he said

after a yearlong effort to fight inflation 
with high interest rates the federal reserve appears to be taking 
its first steps toward easing credit policies many economists said 
tuesday 
these analysts said fed policymakers had apparently become 
convinced the economy had slowed sufficiently to ease inflationary 
pressures 
the bush administration which at times has been openly critical 
of the feds previous tightmoney policies reacted to the apparent 
change by saying the administration had utmost confidence in the 
central bank 
starting in march 1988 the federal reserve had pushed shortterm 
interest rates up by 3 percentage points in an effort to fight 
inflationary pressures by raising the cost of consumer and business 
borrowing and thus dampening demand 
but in a sign of an apparent shift a closely watched barometer 
of fed policy the federal funds rate declined on both monday and 
tuesday 
the federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each 
other to make overnight loans the central bank influences the rate 
through daily decisions on how much money it will make available to 
the banking system 
the federal funds rate which had been averaging between 975 
percent and 988 percent fell to around 963 percent on monday and 
dropped further to around 956 percent on tuesday 
we feel the federal reserve is easing and i expect they will 
allow the federal funds rate to drop even further said elliott 
platt director of economic research at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
he predicted a host of business and consumer loans would be 
headed lower in the months ahead as the fed loosens credit in an 
effort to keep the economy out of a recession 
on monday major banks announced they were cutting their prime 
lending rate by onehalf percentage point to 11 percent the first 
reduction in this benchmark lending rate in more than a year 
platt said he looked for the prime rate to fall to 95 percent 
over the next three to six months reflecting in part the feds 
easier money policy 
michael boskin president bushs chief economic adviser refused 
to comment specifically on whether the fed had begun driving 
interest rates lower but he expressed confidence in the decisions 
of fed policymakers 
we in the administration have a great deal of confidence in the 
federal reserves ability to make sure that we dont let the 
inflation genie out of the bottle on the one hand while making sure 
that we do not overdo monetary tightening and throw the economy into 
a recession he said during an appearance before the national 
press club 
earlier this year bush and treasury secretary nicholas brady had 
openly criticized the central bank for being overly concerned about 
inflation while disregarding the threat that high interest rates 
could topple the country into a recession 
boskin said tuesday that it made sense for the central bank to 
err on the side of fighting inflation in january and february when 
inflationary pressures were higher 
but he said current signals showed that the jumps in consumer 
prices earlier in the year were related to temporary boosts in food 
and energy costs and had not become embedded in the economy he said 
also there were many signs that economic growth was slowing to a 
more sustainable pace 
we have more balance now and we seem to be getting some 
slowdown boskin said i have utmost confidence in the federal 
reserve 
analysts said the may unemployment report released last friday 
probably provided the final bit of evidence the central bank needed 
to decide that it could begin loosening its credit grip the 
unemployment rate fell to 52 percent but it was accompanied by a 
sluggish increase in the number of jobs the economy created 
former fed governor lyle gramley chief economist of the mortgage 
bankers association said he believed the fed would move cautiously 
in lowering interest rates until it was more certain that inflation 
was under control 
i think the fed will be cautious because we are not entirely 
certain that our inflation problem is behind us gramley said 
gramley predicted that mortgage rates will drop further as 
inflationary fears ease in financial markets fixedrate mortgages 
dropped to a national average of 1048 percent last week down from 
close to 11 percent at the beginning of may

president bush on tuesday marked the 45th 
anniversary of the normandy invasion and called for redoubled 
efforts to help spread democracy around the globe 
bush in a statement on the anniversary of dday linked the 
current stuggle in china and the allied invasion that hastened the 
liberation of europe in 1945 
the turmoil and confusion of battle that day belied the calm 
purposefulness with which freedom confronts tyranny the president 
said 
in recent days the face of the world has again been marked by 
dramatic occurrences winds of change that signify the 
determination with which freedom confounds its adversaries he 
said 
he recalled that on the morning of june 6 1944 gen dwight d 
eisenhower carried in his pocket a draft message declaring the 
invasion to have been a failure and taking personal responsibility 
for that failure 
he never needed to use that draft of course he added 
as with gen eisenhower then we cannot know with certainty 
today whether the forces of freedom will prevail soon or in every 
instance bush said yet the ultimate victory of freedom and 
democracy is inevitable 
he said last weeks successful nato summit as well as the 
first free elections in poland in more than 50 years and even the 
momentous tragic events in china give us reason to redouble our 
efforts to continue the spread of freedom and democracy around the 
globe

the house of representatives elevated thomas s 
foley of washington to be the 49th speaker in its history tuesday 
and he immediately appealed to both parties to put away 
bitterness after months of turmoil that led to the forced 
resignation of speaker jim wright 
foley promised to help return tranquility to a house that has 
been ripped by charges and countercharges of ethical impropriety 
and to put ethics reform on his list of priorities for the year 
i am a proud democrat foley declared to the full house after 
he was elected and sworn in he appealed to republicans as well as 
his own party to come together and put away bitterness and 
division and hostility 
we need to debate public issues vigorously even passionately 
but we need to debate and decide with reason and without rancor 
he said 
foley was elected on a partyline vote of 251 to 164 defeating 
republican leader robert h michel of illinois the vote in a 
crowded house chamber marked the first time a party has changed 
speakers in the middle of a congressional term because of a 
controversy over ethics 
michel in his concession speech said im all for putting an 
end to bitterness im all for putting our house in order but we 
dont do it by sweeping things under the rug 
in a final shot at wright michel said members of the ethics 
committee who had investigated him were neither mindless nor 
cannibals a reference to wrights call last week for the house 
to end the mindless cannibalism he saw around him 
foley preached conciliation all day 
in one session with reporters he refused to rise to the bait as 
he was asked repeatedly about gop criticism of him by the republican 
national committee which is led by president bushs former campaign 
manager lee atwater 
foley said he would not get into debating matters with mr 
atwater i want to put this house and the congress squarely back 
on a track of dealing with the issues that the country elected the 
congress to resolve with the president 
he commented after joining other congressional leaders at a white 
house meeting on environmental legislation and after bush 
congratulated him on his new position 
president bush is the president of the united states and every 
way that i can work cooperatively with him and my colleagues in the 
congress i want to do so foley said 
wright who turned the gavel over to his successor praised him 
before the house session as a man who could turn the chambers 
attention from backbiting to lawmaking 
my great hope is that the house can return to its most 
important business of legislating wright said adding that 
vigilantism just begets more bad will 
aides in wrights office packed files and mementoes into boxes 
and workmen hauled them off wright spent the afternoon in his 
office as foley and other congressional leaders went to the white 
house 
at a news conference after he returned foley said he was asking 
two bipartisan house task forces one on ethics and the other on 
campaign reform to make their recommendations as soon as possible 
so legislation could be considered in this congress this year 
a ban on congressional speaking fees linked with a federal pay 
raise phased in over several years could be a possibility he said 
foley the partys majority leader for the past 2 years had 
been nominated unanimously by democrats 
rep tony coelho dcalif who also is resigning from the house 
because of ethics charges called foley a man for all seasons a 
man uniquely suited for this season 
there is a steadfastness an inner serenity to this man said 
rep louise slaughter dny who also made a nominating speech for 
foley in the caucus meeting 
but democrats were having a hard time forgetting the relentless 
assault led by rep newt gingrich rga that led to the fall of 
wright gingrich now the house gop whip formally filed charges 
against the texas democrat last year triggering a yearlong ethics 
committee probe that cost more than 15 million and led to 
allegations wright violated house rules 69 times 
wright fought the charges for months but announced last week 
that he would resign not only the speakership but also his 
congressional seat 
of the ethics commttee and gingrich who himself faces ethics 
allegations over a bookpromotion deal slaughter said i want 
them to treat him fairly but i certainly want them to treat him 
republicans on tuesday circulated lapel buttons that said 
reform not revenge 
what you have is the schoolyard bully whos afraid of getting 
punched back said rep barney frank dmass 
the republican political machine under the leadership of atwater 
at the republican national committee and edward rollins at the 
national republican congressional committee has taken on a harder 
partisan edge and has plans to exploit the ethics issue 
one gop political source who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity said the campaign arm is sifting through democrats 
financial disclosure forms looking for mistakes they can capitalize 
on 
the democrats are expected to select a replacement for foley as 
majority leader next week richard gephardt of missouri who ran 
unsuccessfully last year for the democratic presidential nomination 
is considered the favorite over ed jenkins of georgia 
the whips race to replace coelho is a contest among three 
already powerful house democrats william h gray iii of 
pennsylvania the chairman of the house democratic caucus david 
bonior of michigan the chief deputy whip and beryl anthony of 
arkansas chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee a fourth potential candidate henry waxman of california 
said tuesday he would not seek the post

the promotion of democratic rep thomas s 
foley to speaker of the house leaves other leadership gaps his party 
hopes to fill quickly 
foley dwash who had held the post of majority leader 
succeeded jim wright tuesday six days after wright announced he 
would step down because of charges that he violated house rules on 
outside income 
but the next in line for foleys no 2 post democratic whip tony 
coelho dcalif also is resigning rather than face an ethics 
inquiry like the one that ended wrights career 
so both the no 2 and no 3 democratic slots in the house need 
filling with democrats eager to put the ethics episode behind them 
and limit any political damage a party caucus has been scheduled 
for next wednesday on those races 
rep richard gephardt of missouri is widely considered the 
favorite to succeed foley as majority leader gephardt who ran 
unsuccessfully for the democratic presidential nomination last year 
is considered a strong spokesman for the party without any potential 
ethics issues in his background 
opposing him is rep ed jenkins of georgia one of the more 
conservative democrats jenkins like gephardt is a popular member 
of the ways and means committee and he enjoys the backing of that 
panels chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
its a good competition without acrimony gephardt said 
tuesday 
the race for the title of majority whip narrowed to three 
alreadypowerful democrats on tuesday when rep henry waxman 
dcalif announced that he would not be a candidate 
rep william h gray iii of pennsylvania currently chairman of 
the house democratic caucus is considered the frontrunner 
however hes been battling published reports that the justice 
department is conducting a preliminary investigation of his 
personnel practices including an allegation about a noshow 
employee he has denied any wrongdoing and has questioned the timing 
of leaks that occurred just as he was running for whip 
grays remaining opponents in the race are reps david bonior of 
michigan the chief deputy whip and beryl anthony of arkansas the 
chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee 
if gray wins his caucus chairmanship will be vacant two 
lawmakers steny hoyer of maryland and barbara kennelly of 
connecticut have announced they would like to succeed gray 
the death last week of rep claude pepper dfla also made 
vacant the powerful post of chairman of the rules committee a 
democratic caucus was scheduled for wednesday to put rep joe 
moakley of massachusetts in that position 
coelho has announced he will leave the house on june 15 and 
wright also has said he will give up his texas seat this month with 
peppers death three house seats long held by democrats will be up 
for election

the communist government demoralized by 
its crushing election defeat again urged victorious solidarity on 
tuesday to join a governing coalition a proposal the union has 
turned down 
it is time for a broad postelection coalition a kind of pact 
for economic reforms and democracy government spokesman zbyslaw 
rykowski told a news conference a communist party spokesman said 
monday that solidarity should show coresponsibility for the 
country 
politburo member marian orzechowski later told polish radio 
the voters verdict shows all political forces that is my 
communist party other coalition parties groups and solidarity 
must undertake responsibility for polands future 
but solidarity leader lech walesa said earlier we did not 
fight for chairs in the cabinet for ourselves we fought for a 
different system of wielding power in this country 
in sundays election the independent union movement won an 
overwhelming majority in the new 100member senate and virtually all 
of the 161 seats available to the opposition in the 460seat sejm 
the existing lower house 
but the most bitter defeat dealt to the communists was with the 
national list that list had 35 top party and government leaders 
running unopposed for the sejm but the candidates had to receive a 
least 50 percent of the vote 
it appeared that many ranking officials on the list including 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski would not receive 50 percent 
because millions of voters scratched their names from the list 
the victorious union said earlier that the communists and their 
allies could have all of the 299 sejm seats allotted to them under 
the april agreement that legalized solidarity again and provided for 
the elections 
rykowski did not say what kind of coalition the communists 
envisioned and that question must wait until the new parliament 
convenes after june 18 
orzechowski suggested various forms for such a coalition ranging 
from some kind of parliamentary cooperation to solidarity 
paritipation in the government 
results that we know are certainly bitter for my party and they 
must make her think very deeply make deep reflections draw all 
conclusions no matter how deeply and how far they would go 
orzechowcki said 
solidarity has declared that it would not seek more power than it 
was granted under the april accord 
one seat in the sejm and seven in the senate may have to be 
settled in runoff elections on june 18 said anna mizgajska a 
member of a solidarity committee tabulating results 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in 
washington the us regards solidaritys apparent victory as a 
victory for all poles yesterdays concession by the polish 
communist party was statesmanlike and commendable 
we welcome the reaffirmation of the party spokesman that the 
polish government will continue democratic and economic reforms we 
welcome lech walesas call for hard work by all sides to find 
solutions to the countrys economic and political problems 
the polish government spokesman said rakowski will offer his 
resignation and that of his cabinet in keeping with tradition when 
the new parliament is seated 
but there was no indication whether rakowski named prime 
minister in september would actually step down or shuffle his 
cabinet 
the government said its poor showing was due to pentup 
emotions and complained about unreasonable propaganda against the 
national list 
loss of the list could mean that such leading figures as 
rakowski interior minister czeslaw kiszczak and eight members of 
the 17member communist party politburo will not be seated in 
parliament 
under law the rejected officials can keep their regular 
government posts but it would be a blow to authorities prestige 
and the legitimacy of oneparty rule 
many voters sunday expressed pleasure at being able to cross off 
leaders responsible for the dec 13 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
that suppressed solidarity the soviet blocs first independent 
trade union 
walesa said the union considered itself bound by the april 5 
agreement in which it agreed to allow the government a full 65 
percent of sejm or 299 seats 
we have a lot of problems to solve in poland we have to 
respect the roundtable agreements its the platform from which we 
started he said lets reject emotions and get on with solving 
problems 
authorities should be allowed to fill the vacant seats among the 
299 in any manner they wish solidarity national spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz and union adviser bronislaw geremek told a news 
conference 
we await what kind of proposals or solutions will be taken by 
the other side geremek said one such solution might be a new 
election to fill the seats 
there have been no details on what polish leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski meant when he suggested a coalition in a speech friday 
night 
any such deal could open the path to a sharing of power 
unprecedented in the soviet bloc where communist parties have 
maintained a monopoly on power since the late 1940s 
the next government will be formed by a prime minister named by 
the president a new post created as part of the accord between 
solidarity and the government 
the post was widely expected to go jaruzelski due to the majority 
guaranteed the communist party and its allies in parliament 
but after solidaritys solid victory the opposition might propose 
a countercandidate

a prominent soviet writer said during parliamentary 
debate tuesday on nationalist unrest that soldiers covered up ethnic 
violence three years ago in kazakhstan 
the debate in the congress of peoples deputies took place at a 
time of more ethnic troubles this time in the central asian 
republic uzbekistan at least 50 people were reported killed over 
the weekend 
writer mukhtar sakhanov said a letter from intellectuals in 
kazakhstan charged that soldiers used dogs and shovels to disperse 
protesters and that the number of deaths has been kept secret 
that protest was the first in a long series of ethnic 
disturbances under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
greater openness and social and economic reform 
sakhanov summarized the letter then turned it over to gorbachev 
during tuesdays session 
it said the number of deaths in rioting in the republics 
capital alma ata was greater than the 32 killed last year during 
violence last year between ethnic armenians and azerbaijanis 
according to incomplete data about 3000 people were arrested 
hundreds of them were sentenced to long prison terms thousands were 
excluded from schools or fired from work said the letter written 
by seven kazakh intellectuals copies were circulated in moscow by 
kazakh activists 
the violence in sumgait the azerbaijani capital was caused by a 
dispute over nagornokarabakh an enclave in azerbaijan whose 
population is predominantly armenian the territory was assigned to 
azerbaijan in 1923 but armenia wants to annex it 
on april 9 troops battled proindependence demonstrators in 
tbilisi the capital of the georgian republic and at least 20 
demonstrators were killed the use of shovels and a debilitating gas 
by soldiers who broke up that protests has caused national outcry 
the baltic republics of lithuania estonia and latvia also have 
been beds of unrest as activists press for more autonomy 
official reports have said that only a couple of people were 
killed in the kazakh rioting which broke out after the republics 
communist party chief dinmukhamed kunaev an ethnic kazakh was 
replaced by russian gennady kolbin 
the letter demanded a legislative commission be formed to 
investigate the rioting 
also tuesday russian writer valentin rasputin characterized the 
dominant russian population as a victim rather than master of the 
vast soviet bureaucracy 
ethnic minorities blame centralized control on domination by 
russians in moscow but rasputin of the siberian city irkutsk said 
the system had plundered russia to such an extent that it is just 
on this side of survival 
he complained that when russians begin talking of their own 
national culture and traditions they immediately make other ethnic 
groups wary 
members of the newly formed soviet of nationalities the house of 
the supreme soviet legislature that is assigned to deal with ethnic 
questions also met tuesday and debated the ethnic unrest issue 
it named the communist party chief of uzbekistan rafik nishanov 
as their chairman after questioning him about the violence in his 
republic 
of 252 deputies present five voted against nishanov and 11 
abstained 
gorbachev presiding over the chamber said the tone of some of 
the debate leads to concern but that he was satisfied with it 
im very pleased because of the informal character of 
discussion he said he said the house cannot duck hard questions 
this is the peoples life and we have to approach it seriously 
gorbachev said 
the soviet of nationalities met after a morning session of the 
2250member congress 
lithuanian deputies demanded veto power over selection of the 
chairman of the soviet of nationalities when the house refused to 
go along a deputy who did not identify himself raised the 
possibility of lithuanian secession 
this is a constitutional right and i do not want my native 
lithuania to be in such a bad union if it goes like this he said 
deputy vladimir yarovoi complained to the congress that estonian 
officials were discriminating against others reform in estonia is 
a oneway street where there is no place for russians he said

bush administration officials and lawmakers 
clashed tuesday over legislation calling for ussoviet 
negotiations to ban the superpowers production of plutonium the 
material used in nuclear weapons 
under questioning from members of the house armed services panel 
on department of energy nuclear facilities administration officials 
also conceded that the united states has the ability to detect work 
at soviet reactors that manufacture plutonium 
dont we have the technical ability to pick up a largescale 
plant in the soviet union said rep ron wyden dore one of the 
house sponsors of the international plutonium control act 
after calling the question difficult to answer in an open 
session troy e wade ii the energy departments acting assistant 
secretary of energy for defense programs said 
we can determine if the facility is operating or not operating 
period 
wyden and rep bill green rny testified before the panel on 
behalf of the legislation that seeks to compel the administration to 
pursue the negotiations by threatening to block operation of some 
us nuclear weapons facilities 
identical bills introduced in the house and the senate say that 
six months after enactment president bush would be prohibited from 
operating any of the facilities dedicated to production of plutonium 
for military purposes unless he certified one of the following 
conditions 
the soviet government refuses to negotiate a ban on plutonium 
and highly enriched uranium 
the united states is unable to determine whether the soviets 
have halted production or 
the soviets continue to get plutonium by operating civilian 
plants 
us facilities geared to plutonium operation are either 
mothballed or closed permanently in the soviet union 14 reactors 
produce enriched uranium and plutonium for the nuclear arsenal 
although last month kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev announced 
that he would shut down by the end of the year three of 14 reactors 
that produce enriched uranium and plutonium for the soviet nuclear 
arsenal 
the many congressional cosponsors of the international 
plutonium control act have in effect asked the administration to 
call secretary gorbachevs hand on the plutonium issue and negotiate 
a mutual and verifiable end to production wyden said 
green said that when secretary of state james a baker iii met 
with gorbachev early last month the kremlin leader expressed a 
desire to work on a bilateral agreement on controlling production of 
all weapongrade fissionable materials 
we should call his bluff green told the committee 
but kathleen c bailey assistant director of the us arms 
control and disarmament agency argued against the legislation 
saying the absence of us facilities dedicated to plutonium 
production versus the more than 10 soviet reactors would force bush 
to negotiate from a position of weakness 
in addition this legislation would undermine us capability 
to make strategic nuclear materials in support of our nuclear 
deterrent hampering our capability to produce nuclear weapons 
before we cease to rely on them is dangerous and destabilizing 
bailey noted that the soviet nuclear program does not separate 
military and civilian facilities while the united states does if 
the soviets decided to break out of the ban they could send 
us inspectors home and turn their facilities and plutonium 
stockpile to weapons purposes 
the administration argument prompted rep james bilbray dnev 
to question whether the united states would have to build up its 
capacity so we can break out 
bailey responded the united states must negotiate from strength 
saying that was the case on the ussoviet treaty to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
this exchange prompted questions from members as to the amount of 
plutonium the united states has with rep george hochbrueckner 
dny saying he believes that we are awash in plutonium 
but wade who declined to provide statistics saying the 
information is classified said i dont feel awash in plutonium 
myself

only days after some units of the chinese army 
attacked thousands of unarmed demonstrators in beijing citizens 
poured into the streets on tuesday to give a heros welcome to other 
units 
the astonishing contrast represents the sharp differences in 
loyalties and backgrounds among the various factions of this 
nations fighting force 
the 27th army based in hebei province is reviled and feared in 
beijing for shooting hundreds of people and smashing the student 
demonstration in tiananmen square 
but the 38th army which normally is responsible for defending 
beijing is now considered a force that has come to drive the 27th 
from the capital its troops were greeted tuesday with loud applause 
when they entered the city people rushed forward to give them 
cigarettes and shake their hands 
the intentions of the 38th in entering beijing remain unclear 
but chinese and diplomatic sources widely agree the army group has 
come to end the killing and possibly to drive the 27th from beijing 
details are sketchy on the number of soldiers involved in the 
three or four armies deployed in the beijing area the peoples 
liberation army is organized into about 22 group armies such as the 
27th or 38th each has about three divisions and totals about 40000 
soldiers 
according to some information less than half of each army has 
been deployed in the city 
the group armies of china are roughly equivalent to a western 
army corps which normally has two or more divisions plus auxiliary 
troops 
the londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
estimates the chinese military has more than 3 million men and women 
on active duty with about 23 million in the army the 22 group 
armies are spread among seven designated regions of the country 
the army is overwhelmingly comprised of conscripts peasants are 
drafted and almost always go to group armies in their region and 
stay in that region 
when premier li peng on may 20 declared martial law the orders 
are believed to have gone to the 38th army to suppress the 
prodemocracy students 
astonishingly it appears to have refused to obey orders perhaps 
because many of its recruits are beijing students and its officers 
have close personal and professional ties in the city 
its commander is said to have been arrested for insubordination 
instead the 27th from hebei province was given the task of 
smashing the student unrest most of its soldiers are poorly 
educated youths from rural areas who have been isolated from and 
have little understanding of the democratic goals of the beijing 
students 
more important the commander of the 27th is widely believed to 
have family connections to president yang shangkun a former general 
and a ranking member of the central military commission 
yang an ally of senior leader deng xiaoping has led the 
hardliners demanding a tough stand against the students and was 
instrumental in the reported ouster of communist party chief zhao 
ziyang who favored making concessions to the young activists 
the 27th army now appears to be on the defensive 
along with the 38th army the 28th army is reported to be 
entering the city an army from shenyang in northeastern china 
apparently the 64th army also is said to be in the area and is 
thought to have links with zhao 
there already have been skirmishes reported between soldiers of 
the 28th and 38th with men of the 27th the clashes are possibly a 
prelude to a major battle to drive the 27th out of the capital and 
end one of the worst crises in communist chinas 40year history 
less than half of each corps is thought to have been deployed in 
beijing so far they have shown mainly tanks and armored personnel 
carriers but the groups are also equipped with antiaircraft and 
artillery regiments 
factional fighting has a long tradition in chinese history going 
back to the warlords who constantly sought military advantages over 
their neighbors 
the red army which led the communists to victory in 1949 gave 
china a united fighting force but mao tsetung maintained 
geographical military divisions of first 11 and now seven regions 
regional loyalties and interregional rivalries were a natural 
outcome 
the peoples liberation army has always had a deeply political 
role in communist china as epitomized by maos 1938 statement that 
political power grows out of the barrel of a gun 
during the first years of maos disastrous political upheaval 
the 196676 cultural revolution it was the regional armies that 
stepped in to stop civil war between leftist factions and restore 
order 
the plas most disastrous attempt to interfere in politics came 
in 1971 when marshal lin biao maos chosen successor led a group 
of military officers in planning a coup against mao the plot was 
discovered and lin was killed in an airplane crash while trying to 
escape to the soviet union 
military officers also played key roles in the arrests of the 
leftist gang of four after mao died in 1976 
under current leader deng xiaoping however the pla has striven 
to shed its political side and concentrate on becoming a modern 
fighting force deng reinstated ranks trimmed the size of the pla 
by more than 1 million and reduced the role of political commissars 
in making professional decisions 
still it is the partys central military commission headed by 
deng and yang and not the defense ministry which has the final say 
on military matters and it was these old revolutionaries who 
ordered the pla to open fire on the people of beijing

wilbur the pig and bilbo the hobbit 
have a lot to teach gradeschoolers if only more educators and 
parents would stop being afraid of fantasy literature a professor 
said tuesday 
reading aloud in the classroom has grown more popular in the last 
15 or 20 years but such books as charlottes web and the 
hobbit remain on the outskirts of structured curricula dr 
roberta herrin said 
herrin teaches fantasy literature at east tennessee state 
university and is helping coordinate a workshop next week for 
teachers and librarians on the use of oftenclassic fantasy tales 
the importance of selfesteem is explained through the 
experiences of wilbur in charlottes web ms herrin said 
charlotte a spider befriends the selfpitying pig and encourages 
him to stand on his own four feet 
bilbo baggins in the hobbit finds his true identity after he 
accepts a challenge from the wizard gandalf 
students are more apt to learn the importance of such traits in 
the framework of fantasy ms herrin said 
you start with a narrative a story that engages their 
interest and move from that to the very practical and concrete 
applications she said thats very different than coming in and 
saying today were going to study geography

pope john paul ii sought to make peace 
with scandinavias dominant lutheran church on tuesday and 
challenged sexual and family mores in this liberal nation 
during a mass attended by 13000 people john paul condemned 
abortion and divorce as ravages of sin 
it was the first time he raised the issues on his 10day tour of 
scandinavia where attitudes on sex clash sharply with roman 
catholic teaching 
later he attended a prayer service in the 12th century lutheran 
cathedral in roskilde where he was not allowed to speak 
some of denmarks lutheran bishops had threatened a boycott if 
the pope addressed the congregation at roskilde 
but a public opinion poll published sunday suggests opposing 
bishops were out of step with their congregations the poll found 79 
percent of danes interviewed favored letting the pope speak at 
roskilde traditional burial place of the royal family nine percent 
were against and 12 percent had no opinion 
the evensong service was a compromise john paul walked up the 
aisle of the vaulted church blessing a few people along the way 
and took a special seat to the left of the altar where he followed 
the service in a program 
afterward he met with the lutheran bishops and told them the 
excommunication of martin luther should not be considered an 
obstacle to collaboration and dialogue between roman catholics and 
protestants 
he acknowledged the years have not healed the deep wounds 
caused by the 16th century excommunication of the german priest who 
sparked the protestant reformation but said this cannot be done 
through a juridical church act 
excommunication is the churchs most severe penalty which john 
paul explained is in force only during someones lifetime 
the pope praised luther for his profound religiousness 
primarily today we need a common reassessment of the many 
questions raised by luther and his message he said a 
reassessment from the catholic side has already begun 
luther was excommunicated in 1521 for attacking widespread views 
that salvation could be earned by good works such as paying for 
masses and indulgences to avert penalites in purgatory 
earlier after his arrival from helsinki finland john paul told 
13000 congregants at a mass that sin in todays world takes the 
form of a readiness to disregard human life or manipulate it 
without reference to the inviolable dignity and rights possessed by 
every human person from conception until natural death 
sin he said in english wounds even the most fundamental of 
loving relationships that of marriage by making us think that it 
is too difficult if not impossible to be bound to one person 
faithfully for life 
john paul was speaking in a country where one abortion is 
recorded for every three births and half the marriages end in 
divorce and abortions prohibited by the catholic church are free 
the pope previously was in norway iceland and finland and is to 
visit sweden before returning to rome on saturday

results in poland as an important step toward freedom and 
democracy

steps have been firmly in the right direction bush said in a 
brief statement

its normal policy of not taking sides in foreign elections by 
calling the results victory for all poles

processes in foreign countries without taking sides among competing 
parties 
while praising the concession statement by polands communist 
party state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said tuesday 
the us regards solidaritys apparent victory as a victory for 
all poles 
a state department official insisting on anonymity admitted the 
official position prepared for the daily press briefing was not 
properly phrased 
we had no intention of taking sides the official said we 
should have tightened up the language 
the official said he did not believe a retraction would be issued 
since only one reporter had asked about the statement 
another official expressed no misgivings about the statement 
saying we feel solidarity better represents the people of poland 
than the other fellows the communists

the contras on tuesday again defied us pressure to 
return to nicaragua and vote in februarys elections saying they 
will organize exiles and maintain their military strength 
the state department has urged us to return as quickly as 
possible said aristides sanchez spokesman for the contra 
directorates majority but that is counterproductive it would 
be premature 
only one of the nicaraguan rebels seven directors alfredo 
cesar has said he will go back to his homeland without conditions 
he is scheduled to arrive in managua next week to begin preparations 
for national elections 
the directorate is based in miami which was chosen for its 
proximity to the central american country and its large nicaraguan 
community 
cesars action shows different criteria and those are not the 
criteria of the majority we think it divides the opposition 
sanchez said 
the rebels who are receiving only nonlethal aid from the united 
states will also resist pressure to disband their troops 
concentrated in honduran camps just north of the nicaraguan border 
the spokesman said 
if the elections are a fraud and if they do not produce a 
constitutional free democratic country the troops should be 
viable to take up the struggle again he said 
the contra rebel groups were supposed to be reintegrated into 
civilian life under the central american peace plan approved by the 
regions presidents but the contra leadership has refused accusing 
the sandinistas of violating their guarantees under the pact the 
bush administration has threatened to renew military aid to the 
contras if the national elections are unfair 
in an official statement announcing their electoral strategy the 
contra directors pledged tuesday to deliver a minimum 250000 
nicaraguan exile votes to the opposition in february 
nicaraguas population of about 3 million includes 175 million 
voters according to the government but exiles would have to return 
to nicaragua to vote under the law which the opposition is trying 
to change to allow voting in consulates 
as many as half a million nicaraguans have fled the war and 
economic chaos in their country with most settling in neighboring 
central american countries and the united states 
the contra statement said the contra leaders will not return to 
nicaragua until they have successfully concluded talks with the 
internal opposition aimed at unifying antisandinista groups and 
settling on a single presidential candidate 
the contras will insist on a national dialogue to set 
conditions for februarys vote the statement said 
with a unified opposition the candidate should take the 
initiative to call all nicaraguans back to support them sanchez 
said returning before that would be premature 
the contras and the internal civic opposition are meeting to 
establish such a united front sanchez said 
asked how long the unification might take he said we had hoped 
it would already be done refusing to give a deadline for the 
talks to end 
he said the sandinistas have blocked the negotiations with a 
series of impediments such as denying visas to participants to 
freely enter and leave nicaragua

government forces nearly 70 years ago

join up with two other groups of marching miners plus machinists on 
strike against eastern airlines for a multiunion rally sunday at 
the state capitol in charleston with jesse jackson scheduled as a 
speaker 
well be singing all the way were not calling this off for 
rain sleet snow or nothing said bethel purkey president of 
united mine workers local 5815 
about 60 striking umw members left their picket shacks near logan 
early tuesday on the 85mile march toward charleston he said 
the logan marchers at midafternoon reached blair mountain the 
site of a 1921 confrontation between federal troops and coal miners 
struggling to organize west virginias mines 
the miners lost that battle in a bloody era of the states 
history but the confrontation marked a turning point in the umws 
rise to power the marchers planned to erect a plaque to commemorate 
the battle 
they passed this way to win what they got so were passing 
this way to keep what weve got said john tomblin 35 of logan 
in addition to jackson sundays rally is expected to draw

a third group of miners on strike against the new beckley mining 
corp at the companys glen daniel mine also planned to join the 
march saturday new beckley miners have been off the jobs since 
january 
the battle of blair mountain was a result of a long history of 
poor miners trying to organize and coal companies working maintain a 
status quo 
the umw had been formed in 1890 but its attempts to organize 
workers in southern west virginias logan and mingo counties met 
with a coal company practice of firing anyone who joined the union 
and evicting them from companyowned houses 
the conflict led to the matewan massacre on may 19 1920 in 
which 10 people including seven coal company detectives and 
matewans mayor were killed the next year mingo county sheriff 
sid hatfield a defender of the union was shot and killed at the 
mcdowell county courthouse where he was standing trial for murder in 
connection with the matewan shootout 
upon news of hatfields death miners gathered at marmet outside 
charleston for an invasion of logan and mingo counties and at blair 
mountain met federal troops who had been called from kentucky and 
virginia 
three union men were killed and 40 men from both sides were 
wounded the state brought 543 people to trial 22 on treason 
charges but the treason charges were dropped and all others were 
acquitted

beijing as troops continued random shooting on the streets and some 
countries chartered aircraft to speed the evacuation 
in washington the us state department urged the 1440 
americans in the capital to leave and the 7360 americans who are 
permanent residents elsewhere in china were advised to consider 
leaving 
the bush administration said it was considering using chartered 
aircraft to evacuate americans an administration official said on 
condition of anonymity but he said americans did not appear to be 
in immediate danger 
hundreds of anxious foreigners jammed airline offices and swamped 
embassy switchboards with telephone calls for advice several 
thousand filled the small international departure area of beijing 
airport many trying to buy tickets on standby 
michael thompson of london waiting with about 100 other british 
students and teachers to board a special british airways charter 
recalled it was less than two months ago that students at beijing 
normal university where he studied first demanded democratic 
reform 
who would have thought it would end like this he said 
despite the turmoil small numbers of foreigners continued to 
arrive in beijing on regular flights about two dozen nurses from 
around the world flew in from hong kong late monday to attend a 
nursing convention 
we hope we wont be called into service said one 
foreigners who have decided to remain behind rushed to stock up 
on food supplies at the few stores still open in expectation of 
prolonged violence 
do not go on balconies look out the window or take photographs 
of troops the british embassy warned in a handwritten sign tacked 
on its door they have warned they will shoot they mean it 
the us embassy which joined tuesday in urging its nationals to 
leave beijing hung small american flags from the doors of its 
embassy vehicles and taped signs in the windows saying in chinese 
american embassy apparently hoping to discourage attack 
soldiers at some intersections have fired at any vehicles passing 
through 
a us embassy spokeswoman who did not want her name used said 
staff members were telephoning all americans who registered as 
residents in beijing to advise them to leave 
canada said it was reducing its embassy staff to a skeleton 15 
down from more than 40 canadians but other countries such as west 
germany and new zealand said they were sending out only the 
dependants of embassy staffers

a california condor chick emerged from its shell 
tuesday marking the fourth captive hatching in the most productive 
breeding season for the critically endangered bird since 1984 
officials said 
named shasta for the volcanic california mountain that was once a 
range for north americas largest land bird the chick was helped 
out of its shell by keepers at san diego wild animal park said park 
spokesman tom hanscom 
the egg was removed from its nest at the parks condorminium 
soon after it was produced april 9 by the parents of molloko and 
mandan the first and second california condors to be born and bred 
in captivity 
the birds gender will be determined by a blood test hanscom 
said 
the hatching process began saturday when the chick pecked a hole 
in its shell during the final seven minutes keepers cracked away 
bits of shell until the 68ounce chick was freed 
this is the most productive year since 1984 when eight condor 
eggs were taken from the wild and six successfully hatched said 
hanscom he said a seventh condor was born in the wild that year 
but five condor deaths in the wilderness reduced the net population 
gain to two 
shastas hatching raised the species population to 32 it also 
represented the first successful doubleclutch in captivity 
hanscom said 
condors naturally produce a single egg each year but often lay a 
replacement egg if the first is lost early in the egglaying season 
all condors known to exist are in captivity 18 at the san diego 
wild animal park and 14 at the los angeles zoo the goal of the 
program is to rebuild the population to the point where condors can 
be reintroduced into the wild 
hanscom said keepers hope to release an initial group of condors 
in 1992

democratic nomination for governor tuesday while four republicans 
were locked in a close battle for a chance to succeed outgoing gov

rivals in the democratic primary with 9 percent of precincts 
reporting florio had 19356 votes or 64 percent assemblyman alan 
karcher had 5680 votes or 19 percent and princeton mayor barbara 
sigmund had 5195 votes or 17 percent

24 percent and state sen william gormley with 8736 votes or 24 
percent state assembly speaker chuck hardwick was fourth with 6307 
votes or 17 percent 
republican state sen gerald cardinale who sounded a 
conservative theme was running a distant fifth and three other 
republicans who ran lowbudget campaign lois rand thomas 
blomquist and james kolyer trailed far behind 
kean barred by law from seeking a third consecutive fouryear 
term made no endorsement in what became one of the states closest 
gop primaries in recent history 
florio who lost to kean in 1981 by 1797 votes out of 23 
million cast deliberately kept a low profile on the campaign trail 
and refused to engage in much debate with his more liberal opponents 
in sacramento calif voters decided whether the rancho seco

all of new jerseys major candidates agreed to accept public 
financing and limit their campaign spending to 22 million that 
plus republican keans decision not to endorse any of the four 
leading candidates also helped level the playing field

alone was not from the state capital of trenton and did not 
participate in creating the states automobile insurance and budget 
problems 
edwards emphasized his seven years of experience as a top adviser 
and cabinet official in the kean administration saying he has 
experience making hard decisions and writing budgets 
hardwick appealed largely to the conservative wing of the 
republican party and courted the prolife and gun lobbies 
gormley spent most of his time and money in southern new jersey 
aligning himself with kean and going after moderate voters 
during a grueling four months of campaigning the gop candidates 
confronted each other at roughly 30 different forums including five 
hours of sometimes rancorous televised debates

the senate voted 1000 tuesday to urge 
president bush to consult immediately with us allies on imposing 
international sanctions against the chinese government to 
demonstrate abhorrence over the killing of thousands of unarmed 
students 
the house earlier voted 4060 to approve a resolution condemning 
the violence used against prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing and 
commending the president for acting to end military cooperation with 
china 
the senate resolution also commends bush and condemns the 
brutal use of force by the government of the peoples republic of 
china against unarmed advocates of democracy and human rights in 
china 
but it also urges serious consideration of steps that go beyond 
those taken so far by the president including the consideration of 
international sanctions 
these include 
calling on the us exportimport bank and the overseas private 
investment corp to review financing of trade with china in light 
of existing legal requirements for adequate human rights treatment 
and the deteriorating condition of human rights in china 
urging those us agencies charged with liberalizing procedures 
for export licenses for sales to china to take into account the 
current situation in china in making their decisions 
urging the voice of america to immediately increase 
chineselanguage programming 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and minority 
leader bob dole rkan said the administration supported the 
resolution 
mitchell said that while the united states cannot control events 
in china it is within our power to express the views of the 
american people clearly unequivocally and unambiguously in 
total condemnation and denunciation of the actions that have been 
taken 
we have witnessed a great leap backward in china said dole 
i hope it is not too late for chinas leaders to come to their 
senses 
sen paul simon dill said an increase in voice of america 
broadcasts can be accomplished quickly and do a service for the 
people of china 
sen arlen specter rpa said this resolution is mild 
compared to what the majority of us would like to see done to those 
responsible for these atrocious acts

as rival troops squared off in beijing the 
bush administration said tuesday that chinas senior leaders 
appeared to have left the capital and urged the 1440 americans in 
the city to get ut themselves 
its like the place is closed down said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater theres been no communication from the 
leadership theres no indication who the leadership is 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called the 
situation in beijing tense and unsettled 
she acknowledged there may be dissension within the chinese armed 
forces and a us intelligence source commenting on the grounds of 
anonymity said what were seeing first is a political struggle 
the outlines of which are very vague plus there is a serious 
division within the chinese army leadership 
fitzwater said the us embassy has been in contact only with 
midlevel chinese officials but has had no contact with the 
toplevel people and weve tried 
the assumption has been that the toplevel people have moved 
out to other locations we tend to believe it 
tutwiler meanwhile referring to the shooting of hundreds of 
students demonstrating for democracy told reporters 
we have reason to believe that all elements of the army do not 
support what is taking place we have no firm evidence of armed 
clashes 
the chinese capital was threatened with civil war as armies loyal 
to rival political factions were reported battling in the city 
the us intelligence source said his information was that army 
units from beijing had refused to move against the students in 
tiananmen square even as army elements from nanjing carried out 
sundays bloody attack 
were hearing all the reports of shooting between army units 
but we have not confirmed that ourselves the source added 
an official speaking on conditition of anonymity said us 
intelligence reports reaching washington estimated the death toll at 
3000 in line with estimates by diploatic sources in beijing but 10 
times the chinese government estimate this official said the 
reports stressed the toll could go higher 
secretary of state james a baker iii decided to encourage 
americans to leave beijing after a long telephone conversation 
monday night with james lilley the us ambassador there baker was 
told 50 percent to 75 percent of the employees of american firms had 
already decided to leave 
ms tutwiler said arrangements were being discussed with united 
airlines and northwest airlines to supplement their regular service 
from china with charter flights to carry out americans 
but united spokesman joe hopkins said in chicago that his airline 
had no plans to add flights 
were just operating our regular schedule of three flights a 
week he said 
indeed one state department official said that regularly 
scheduled flights were proving adequate so far to handle the 
number of americans leaving the capital 
we cannot order them to leave the official said of the 
americans choosing to stay 
in other developments 
a state department official noted chinese dissident fang lizhi 
has been allowed to take refuge in the us embassy in beijing 
the official who requested anonymity said fang a 53yearold 
astrophysicist who had been denied permission to meet with president 
bush when he visited china in february took refuge for his own 
safety and has been at the embassy at least since monday 
bush directed the justice department not to move against chinese 
nationals whose visas have expired ms tutwiler said the visitors 
could stay indefinitely 
subsequently attorney general dick thornburgh issued an order 
allowing 73000 chinese students and 250000 chinese visitors and 
business travelers to stay in the united states if they request 
oneyear extensions of their visas 
the national academy of sciences announced it was suspending a 
cooperative exchange program with the chinese academy of sciences 
frank press the president of the national academy said in a 
telex to chinese academy of sciences president zhou guangzhao that 
the exchanges were being suspended in outrage and sadness and 
that americans are shocked and dismayed by the action of chinese 
government troops against peaceful demonstrators 
the senate and house voted without dissent for resolutions 
condemning the violence in beijing with the senate resolution 
urging president bush to consult us allies on possible 
international sanctions against china 
on monday even after army troops assaulted the prodemocracy 
students in tiananmen square the state department encouraged 
americans in china simply to stay in touch with the us embassy or 
the four us consulates 
i cant point to any specific thing that happened ms 
tutwiler said about the newest state department guidance every 
day is different 
elsewhere in china the 7360 americans who are permament 
residents were advised to consider leaving the country depending 
on the local situation ms tutwiler said they should not leave 
through beijing 
additionally the families of the 428 american diplomats and 
workers at the us embassy and the consulates were given permission 
to leave the country 
there is no drawdown of embassy officers ms tutwiler said 
the embassy and our four consulate offices continue to operate 
fully 
apart from permanent residents and us officials an estimated 
4000 americans are traveling in china at ny particular time 
tourists were advised not to go there 
it is not an order to leave but we are encouraging them to 
leave a us official said in reference to the advice the embassy 
was giving to the american residents of beijing 
sources said telephone calls were being made systematically to 
all american residents of the capital who had been asked earlier to 
make the embassy aware of their whereabouts 
ms tutwiler and the other officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that no americans were known to have been threatened 
directly but that the situation was too chaotic for them to safely 
remain in china 
on monday bush suspended more than 600 million in us arms 
sales to china but stopped short of advocating economic sanctions 
at least for now 
the decision to encourage americans to leave however could 
itself have a severe impact on american businesses operating in 
china and on commercial ties to the country

the senate sculpted the final contours of a 
catchall bill tuesday rushing 33 billion to veterans programs a 
shattered west virginia telescope and a host of other projects and 
making pronouncements on policies domestic and foreign 
lawmakers had hoped their third day of debate on the legislation 
would be the last as they sorted through amendments to a dire 
emergency measure president bush first proposed in march 
but they bogged down over an amendment offered by sen john 
mccain rariz to delay some of the new catastrophic care 
provisions for the elderly under medicare including the surtax on 
people more than 65 years old designed to pay for the program some 
senior citizens have complained about the tax which can reach a 
maximum of 800 for the wealthiest of them 
democrats said catastrophic care changes should be made in 
separate legislation and work on the bill was scheduled to continue 
wednesday 
the senate rejected 6929 an amendment by sen jesse helms 
rnc allowing the transportation department to block aid to 
communities refusing to give work on public transit projects to 
companies that conduct business with the proapartheid regime of 
south africa 
it also adopted by voice vote a provision by senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine calling on congress to rework a tax 
law business considers burdensome 
that followed a 5049 defeat for sen robert kasten rwis who 
instead wanted the senate to repeal the tax law which forces 
companies to prove their health benefits are as generous to lowpaid 
workers as they are to executives for procedural reasons kasten 
would have needed 60 votes to prevail 
kasten called the provision unwise unworkable and just plain 
unfair democrats agreed that the tax law needs revamping but 
said revoking it would be a mistake 
is there any reason we should be favoring management asked 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
the legislation is aimed at providing extra money for the rest of 
fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 it contains 12 billion for 
veterans programs 892 million for student loans 342 million for 
the costs of last summers western forest fires and money for 
efforts including foster care refugees the united nations and 
food stamps 
it also bestows federal money on a host of projects of a less 
sweeping nature but championed by various legislators for local 
consumption 
thus it contains 75 million to rebuild a 26yearold west 
virginia radio telescope that collapsed last november sought by 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
thanks to senate minority leader bob dole rkan 275000 would 
be set aside for kansas state university to advise farmers on coping 
with drought sen howard metzenbaum dohio garnered 500000 for 
engineering work on a lake in cincinnati that has filled with 
sediment wyomings two gop senators malcolm wallop and alan 
simpson got 400000 for a study of last summers fires at 
yellowstone national park 
in a boon to senators from 39 states the measure also supplies 
66 million to continue subsidizing air carriers serving small 
communities 
the legislation also carries provisions stating the senates 
views on an assortment of topics 
the chamber wants the agriculture department to buy more apples 
for the federal school lunch program to help the countrys ailing 
apple industry thanks to washington states two senators democrat 
brock adams and republican slade gorton 
it wants the department of health and human services to hire more 
employees in honolulu in the home state of appropriations committee 
member sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
and it doesnt want panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega to be 
able to name a new administrator of the panama canal commission 
which by treaty panamas leader is entitled to do 
one thing the bill does not have is 822 million for various 
antidrug programs contained in the 37 billion version of the 
legislation the house passed last month that discrepancy and others 
will have to be worked out by negotiators before the bill can be 
sent to the white house for bushs signature 
bush citing the federal deficit has threatened to veto the 
measure if it has any money for drug programs the measure bush 
initially proposed was for 22 billion

an appeals court ruled tuesday that states 
cannot regulate water flows from federally approved power dams 
rejecting arguments from 17 western states that had sought the 
authority in order to protect fish 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled that the federal 
energy regulatory commission a presidentially appointed agency has 
exclusive power under federal law to set standards for hydroelectric 
projects including water flows needed to protect fish 
the ruling which upheld a 1987 ferc decision affects all types 
of water power projects including larger utilityowned dams which 
periodically must be relicensed it is primarily important in the 
west where small hydroelectric projects have flourished since 
congress passed a law in 1978 requiring utility companies to buy 
electricity from those projects when oil prices exceeded certain 
levels 
the states led by california were supported by several 
environmental groups which in written arguments to the court called 
hydroelectric development one of the greatest threats to our 
nations freeflowing rivers 
the states tend to be the most knowledgeable the most 
sensitive to the resources at stake and they have a major role to 
play in protecting fish and wildlife said john echeverria 
general counsel of american rivers which led a halfdozen 
environmental groups 
the federal agencys position was supported by small dam 
operators and major utility companies who said state regulation 
would disrupt hydroelectric development 
one such project was the rock creek dam a 3000kilowatt project 
on a tributary of the south fork of the american river about 40 
miles east of sacramento 
ferc approved the dam in 1983 and required operators to maintain 
a flow of 11 cubic feet per second of water into rock creek from may 
to september and 15 cubic feet per second from october through 
april to protect an important trout spawning ground 
the california water resources control board at the request of 
state fish and game officials set flow standards in 1986 of 30 and 
60 cubic feet per second for the same two periods saying the lesser 
flows were inadequate to protect the fishery 
rock creek officials objected to ferc which ruled in 1987 that 
it had sole authority to set the flow rates the dam was completed 
in 1986 and has operated under the federal standards 
the other states supporting californias position were alaska 
arizona hawaii idaho kansas montana nebraska nevada new 
mexico north dakota oklahoma oregon south dakota utah

president augusto pinochet said the armed 
forces will not tolerate human rights trials by special courts or 
the congress after a civilian government takes over next march 
the lameduck military president also said he will remain as army 
commander after handing over power to a successor to be elected in 
national balloting dec 14 he said his continuing on an army chief 
was necessary to ensure chiles institutional organization 
pinochets remarks came monday at a meeting with chilean women 
journalists and were carried by local newspapers tuesday 
under the constitution pinochet can stay on as army commander 
for eight years after stepping down as president the opposition 
vehemently opposes that clause but the 73yearold pinochet has 
refused to change it 
asked about allegations of human rights violations under his 
military government pinochet said he agrees some cases must be 
dealt with by the courts but he added i cannot accept that 
members of the services be targeted for revenge or that special 
courts be organized in congress 
he hinted that the future democracy could be threatened if that 
happens 
there would be a reaction against that from the military he 
said and i dont want to even think what might happen 
pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup overthrowing an 
elected leftist government hundreds of leftists later were rounded 
up many were tortured or killed and thousands forced into exile 
the roman catholic church and human rights groups here and abroad 
have documented the cases of about 750 people who disappeared after 
being arrested by security agents 
opposition leaders say they are not out for revenge but intend to 
find the truth about human rights violations and bring those 
responsible to trial 
they insist their aim is to try individuals not the armed 
services as such 
pinochet emphasized that the armed forces have decided to return 
to barracks and move away from the political arena after 16 years in 
power 
now i say so long and its your problem now he said 
its over for me and for the army 
he said the military was leaving in disappointment considering 
the chilean people as having been ungrateful to them 
he referred to last octobers national referendum in which voters

foreign ministers of the organization of 
american states agreed tuesday night to give a sixweek extension to 
a team of mediators assigned to achieve a democratic transfer of 
power in panama 
the mediators are to report back to the foreign ministers before 
july 19 
tuesday had been their deadline for a threeweek effort to work 
out a national accord in panama that would lead to a transfer 
of power in the shortest possible time their was no indication 
though that the mediators had made much progress 
nicaraguan foreign minister miguel descoto opposed the extension 
on grounds that it did not have the explicit support of the 
panamanian government 
nonetheless panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter raised no 
objection to the proposal under which the foreign ministers of 
ecuador costa rica and trinidad will undertake a return mission to 
panama in a bid to carry out the oas mandate 
the agreement was reached in early evening after closeddoor 
talks at the colombian embassy where delegates spent much of the day 
attempting to find common ground 
after the extension was approved descoto delivered a lengthy 
speech strongly criticizing the united states as an imperial 
superpower which has systematically thwarted the 
noninterventionist principles of the oas 
us undersecretary of state for political affairs lawrence 
eagleburger said the oas must take account of charter provisions 
calling for the establishment of representative democracy as a 
guiding hemispheric principle 
the oas must show that the charter is not mere words he said 
eagleburger assailed panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega and 
said that the oas must consider further action against panama if 
progress toward democracy is not achieved quickly 
noriega is the problem he said 
but ritter maintained that a durable solution to panamas 
crisis was not possible as long as us troops remain in the country 
and the united states does not lift the sanctions it imposed against 
panama 15 months ago 
there can be no normal political process under the current 
circumstances in panama he told reporters after the fourhour oas 
meeting elaborating on an earlier speech he made to the gathering 
much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the 
mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission openended 
the mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline 
but the united states and other delegates argued that an openended 
mission would ease pressure on noriega 
the us delegation led by eagleburger had lobbied during the 
closeddoor consultations for the mediators to report in 15 days but 
settled on six weeks 
in a report on their initial mission to panama the mediators 
contended that an extension of their oas mandate would be very 
advisable 
there was no indication in the report that the mediators came 
close to achieving the goals of a resolution approved by the oas 
mission on may 17 much of the fivepage report was devoted to 
listing the names of panamanians with whom the mediators met 
the may 17 resolution criticized noriega for the grave events 
and abuses which occurred during and after the may 7 national 
elections in panama 
amid widespread allegations of fraud by forces loyal to noriega 
the government threw out the election returns creating the crisis 
of legitimacy that the oas has been attempting to resolve there 
also were brutal attacks on some opposition candidates by government 
forces 
one us official said sept 1 is being viewed as a guidepost 
for the oas mediators because panama is scheduled under its 
constitution to change presidents that day 
just who the new president would be is unclear because of the 
scrapping of the may 7 election returns 
opposition candidate guillemo endara is widely believed by 
international observers to have won the election but noriegas 
handpicked candidate carlos duque also claimed victory 
ricardo arias calderon an opposition vice presidential candidate 
who is in washington for the oas meeting said tuesday he believes 
the oas should approve a resolution that shows respect for what 
he claimed was the 31 margin of victory by the opposition 
we beat the dictator at his own game arias calderon said

paramount communications inc late tuesday 
announced a 107 billion takeover offer for publishing and cable 
giant time inc which already plans a merger with warner 
communications inc 
paramount an entertainment and communications company formerly 
known as gulf amp western inc said it offered 175 a share for all 
of times stock 
the announcment came less than three weeks before time and warner 
shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger agreement announced 
in march 
the timewarner merger plan calls for a stock swap that the 
companies valued at 18 billion and said would create the worlds 
largest media and entertainment company 
time said its board would review the proposal and advised its 
shareholders not to do anything until they heard from the company 
warner officials had no immediate comment 
time warner and paramount are all based in new york 
time shares closed at 126 tuesday in consolidated new york stock 
exchange trading up 275 
paramount made its announcement after the market closed and the 
company noted it was offering a price 60 percent higher than times 
share price just before the timewarner deal was announced 
there had been speculation for weeks that a bidder could emerge 
for time despite its merger agreement with warner but time 
executives have privately insisted the company was not for sale 
harold vogel who follows the entertainment industry for merrill 
lynch amp co called it a fascinating situation 
my feeling is that this is going to entail a much lengthier 
battle than time and warner had anticipated vogel said both 
companies were obviously in a rush to get this done as fast as 
possible for concern that someone could come in and upset the 
proposed merger 
martin s davis paramounts chairman and chief executive said 
time and paramount are a superb business fit 
he said the acquisition of time would represent the culmination 
of a sixyear strategic transformation of our company into a leader 
in publishing and entertainment a focus reflected by our new name 
together we will be the foremost american communications 
company capable of competing on a global scale against foreign 
media giants he said 
paramount announced in april that it intended to sell its 
consumer and commercial finance business the associates it is 
expected the sale could produce 3 billion or more in revenue 
paramount said citibank has committed to provide 1 billion in 
financing for the offer and has said it is highly confident of its 
ability to arrange a syndicate of lenders to provide the rest 
davis said he told times chairman and chief executive j 
richard munro that paramount was willing to negotiate all aspects 
of its proposal 
paramount also said it would immediately withdraw its offer if 
time shareholders approve the warner transcation 
both warner and time shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 
proposed merger a stock swap that the companies valued at 18 
billion on june 23 
in a statement time said davis advised munro in a telelphone 
call tuesday evening that paramount was launching a hostile offer 
for times shares 
time said the offer was in contradiction to explicit assurances 
mr davis had previously given mr munro but did not elaborate 
time has indicated that it has a 5 billion credit line available 
to begin its own offer for warner or defend itself against a 
takeover 
paramounts entertainment interests include paramount pictures 
paramount television and paramount home video it owns madison 
square garden and two professional sports teams the new york 
knickerbockers in basketball and the new york rangers in hockey it 
also owns the msg cable network and a 50 percent interest in the usa

would anyone but leo kottke be moved by the act 
of walking across a parking lot with a 6yearold child to suddenly 
broach the subject of the birds and the bees 
pausing to lean on a car bumper kottke recalled i said joe 
dont you ever wonder where you came from how all these people got 
here where i came from the son wondered wearily dad is this 
going to be another one of your jokes 
its often hard to tell whether leo kottke is about to produce 
after tortured rambling some great truth or just another one of 
his jokes 
kottke has an hourlong tv special and it is a treat both for 
kottkes amazing musicianship and for his gentle intelligent wit 
that seems to come from just across the kitchen table not from up 
on stage in front of a couple thousand strangers 
leo kottke home amp away premieres tonight on most pbs 
stations 
perhaps there is something in the water out there in minnesota 
that produces performers who tell engaging but circuitous and often 
surreal stories about just about anything 
garrison keillor turned that ability into an art as well as a 
lucrative radio and book career kottke who often appeared on 
keillors radio show a prairie home companion is more upbeat 
than keillor kind of like an aging kid brother who veered off 
temporarily into zen buddhism somewhere back down the line he can 
be funny and deep at the same time as when he recounts how his 
children squabbling in the back seat of the car were in fact 
displaying a propensity for a mystically defined notion of art 
kottkes meandering stories are a nice juxtaposition to his 
mindbendingly intricate instrumentals his unique style is a 
fusion of country jazz and folk influences in the pbs show he 
also offers up vocal renditions of such classics as the ed 
reevesalex harvey love song ring and paul siebels haunting 
louise chet atkins and doc watson appear for a brief but 
rousing bluegrass jam session 
the special was produced and directed by mary perillo who has 
produced films for pbs performance art series alive from off 
center 
interspersed with elegantly spare concert scenes are video 
vignettes of kottke ranging around a guitar store in nashville 
driving his car shopping i keep lookin for boots he says 
examining a display of the cowboy variety but theyre all 
pointy and musing about the worth of motorboats sitting in 
his own leafcovered example up on blocks in his yard 
the concert footage was filmed in toronto after the first 
number kottke cheerfully explained to the rapt audience its 
really necessary by this time in the set for me to speak and 
launched into a complex exposition on his tendency earlier in his 
20year stage career to become too involved in his own performance 
it seems he would drool on his guitar he determined that this 
chagrined the audience and reformed 
later driving across a sunbathed minnesota landscape kottke 
chats with the camera recalling a philosophers notion that the 
creation of art has to begin with a lie this recalls a backseat 
ruckus between his two young children sarah let out a scream and 
informed her father that joe had stuck his thumb in her eye i 
didnt know that was your face joe explained my heart swelled 
with pride said kottke because i knew i had an artist in the 
back seat 
kottke takes the camera into his basement where bad guitars 
are left to think about what they have done he displays an 
ancient oftrepaired old buzzard of an instrument that had been 
smashed in a car wreck restitched stepped on held together with 
tape reconstructed with a new 28inch neck and then sawed off so 
it would fit in a regulationsize case leaving it with 10 strings 
instead of 12 despite all that kottke says gently im 
still stirred by this instrument 
and so is everybody else

wrong is wrong drug abuse for example racism 
for another whats not as clearcut is how far us society should 
go to redress such wrongs some say recent responses go too far 
jeopardizing the promises of the constitution rights are rights 
they say ap reporters lee mitgang and sharon cohen examine the 
dilemma of societal wrongs and individual rights a perceived 
threat to free speech as colleges fight racism and worries about 
due process as police and politicians use evictions and other 
measures to fight drugs

stung by an outbreak of bigotry on us 
campuses universities are taking steps to curb bias even if that 
means curbing free speech 
civil rights advocates and civil libertarians normally fast 
allies have become adversaries as schools try to limit the views 
students can express and set penalties including expulsion in 
certain cases if those views slur female black or other minority 
students 
such sanctions have stirred a bitter highly complex debate 
within higher education are antibias curbs likely to help or 
hurt are college campuses so different from the rest of society 
that students first amendment rights can be abridged are colleges 
abdicating their role as bastions of ideas no matter how unpopular 
or even hateful finally are antidiscrimination rules 
constitutional 
i dont believe freedom of speech on campus was designed to 
allow people to demean others on campus said robert w ethridge 
director of the equal opportunity program at emory university in 
atlanta which adopted antibias rules last fall 
we just wanted to ensure that at a time when other 
universities were having problems that we made it clear that we 
wouldnt tolerate graffiti on walls or comments in classes 
many agree 
at stanford university where white students displayed a racist 
caricature of beethoven near black students rooms last fall 
minority students have been pressing the school to enact sanctions 
for the past year 
the university of wisconsin where a white fraternity held a 
mock slave auction last year is considering antibias sanctions 
the university of oklahoma is considering tightening existing ones 
but last month a university of michigan graduate student sued 
his school with the help of the american civil liberties union 
arguing that a recently enacted sixpage antibias code is so broad 
it violates the first amendment 
the student identified only as john doe in court papers raised 
a hypothetical question do michigans antibias rules bar a male 
student from saying in class that men outperform women in a 
particular field 
michigans policy empowers the school to punish students guilty 
of discriminatory conduct in classroom buildings libraries and 
university housing but allows for more uninhibited speech in 
student publications and openair campus forums 
it details behavior deemed discriminatory any act that 
stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race 
ethnicity religion sex sexual orientation creed national 
origin ancestry age marital status handicap or vietnamera 
veteran status 
even michigans law school dean lee bollinger wont bet on 
wholl prevail in the lawsuit the case law on what speech can be 
restricted is quite unclear he said 
the constitutional debate centers on the socalled fighting 
words doctrine the us supreme court coined the term in a 1942 
ruling chaplinsky vs new hampshire which stated that the first 
amendment did not protect insulting or fighting words those 
which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an 
immediate breach of the peace 
the justices reiterated that view in brandenburg vs ohio in 
1969 and in hess vs indiana in 1973 
the university of wisconsin filed a brief last march to the 
state board of regents and cited the fighting words doctrine as 
buttressing its proposed antibias rules 
but in other decisions the supreme court has protected 
students rights even the right to protest the draft with obscene 
signs 
in tinker vs des moines public schools in 1969 the court 
upheld students rights to wear black armbands to protest the 
vietnam war because the schools failed to show any evidence of 
serious disruption to the educational process 
but such apparently profree speech rulings may also have sown 
the seeds for restrictions by inference the court indicated it 
might sustain freespeech curbs on campus said bollinger if 
schools can show that certain speech leads to serious 
disruption of education 
a 1988 supreme court ruling involving a hazelwood mo 
principal who censored an article from his high schools newspaper 
held that a school need not tolerate student speech that is 
inconsistent with its basic educational mission even though the 
government could not censor similar speech outside the school 
the hazelwood ruling left unclear however whether that 
principle applied equally to colleges 
at worst civil libertarians fear a future where freespeech 
restrictions could turn americas campuses into reeducation 
camps where only rightthinking people feel free to speak out 
does this mean you eventually ban a louis farrakhan or a meir 
kahane because they might upset some students asked sheldon e 
steinbach vice president and general counsel of the american 
council on education the chief washington lobby for higher 
education 
where are campuses going if they cannot discuss issues openly 
even in a provocative manner if you erect these kinds of potential 
punishments arent you creating a chilling effect on free speech 
on campus if i say the number of jews killed during the holocaust 
was overstated am i baiting will i be judged post facto to have 
said something that is offensive steinbach said 
but the slights and insults minority students say are 
commonplace at alltoomany campuses convinced at least one civil 
liberties advocate that antibias restrictions are needed 
john schwartz a dallas lawyer whose usual stockintrade is 
defending newspapers in first amendment suits wound up drafting 
the university of michigans antibias rules last spring 
schwartz said in an interview that his bedrock allegiance to 
absolute first amendment rights was shaken after spending hours 
hearing black students at the ann arbor campus they described 
among other things how they felt after racist jokes were broadcast 
over a university radio station last year 
i think what tipped it for me was that i had been looking at 
the problem wrong he said i always thought that students 
ought to be able to shrug these racial comments off but minority 
students are incredibly isolated on a mostly white campus i was 
floored by the fact that minority students deal with this on a 
regular basis 
to bollinger and others the essence of the debate gets down to 
what ideals universities ought to represent 
should the university be the place in society where there is 
ultimate protection of free speech or is it a place where you want 
to preserve civility and discourse those are two very different 
models both with strong appeals bollinger said 
on at least some campuses free speech and civility have become 
a very difficult mix

charlene goodman lives by the law and tries to teach her two 
children to do the same but when her 17yearold son was charged 
with selling cocaine it almost cost her family something very 
precious their home 
for three months the wilmington del housing authority fought 
to evict the goodmans from their 311amonth apartment saying the 
drug dealing which occurred miles away near other agency property 
violated terms of their lease 
ultimately ms goodman won her court battle the 32yearold 
seamstress who testified she wasnt aware of her sons actions and 
tried her best to control him was bewildered 
i felt like i was being prosecuted for something someone else 
did she said recalling her worry about being evicted i 
didnt break any law 
her case typifies the growing efforts by law enforcement and 
political leaders to wage war on drugs with tactics evictions 
raids even criminal charges against pregnant women that have 
stirred new debate and sparked numerous lawsuits 
in washington dc and alexandria va people suspected of 
drug involvement have been evicted without being convicted a new 
maryland program asks landlords to include in leases a clause 
stating that anyone selling drugs will be evicted 
in several states prosecutors seek to convict women for using 
drugs during pregnancy minnesota lawmakers recently passed a 
measure to permit doctors who suspect a pregnant woman is abusing 
drugs to test her without her knowledge drug users are not 
punished but urged to seek treatment 
in chicago public housing raids have been conducted without 
warrants or tenants consent a suit also claims personal 
belongings were searched a city alderman wants a law that would 
authorize the arrest of loiterers in areas where drugs are sold 
civil libertarians say these are grandstanding acts that 
victimize the innocent discriminate against the poor and reek of 
mccarthyism beyond that they say theyre ineffective 
the war on drugs is really a war on the american people whose 
rights are being invaded said professor steven wisotsky of nova 
law center in florida theres a mass invasion of civil liberties 
on the grounds its necessary to win the war 
attempts to legislate away social problems are usually very 
unsuccessful said james fyfe an american university 
criminologist and former policeman 
but frustrated prosecutors and politicians pressured to act and 
act fast say aggressive isnt necessarily invasive there are 
enough legal checks and balances to protect the innocent they say 
i dont see where anybody has the civil rights to use drugs 
said prosecutor paul logli of winnebago county ill a grand jury 
recently refused to indict a woman he charged with involuntary 
manslaughter after claiming her cocaine use led to her babys death 
if people are going to do drugs sell drugs or buy drugs they 
have to be discouraged in any way possible logli added people 
who introduce this cancer or support this cancer have to pay a 
price if its losing housing its an appropriate response 
in one week last month in washington marshals evicted 257 
people from residences where suspected drug activity occurred 
some of the most intense efforts have been in druginfested 
public housing housing and urban development officials have issued 
waivers to public housing agencies in boston washington new york 
and alexandria va allowing them to streamline the eviction 
process by up to nine months 
hud secretary jack kemp has vowed to ensure due process but 
some worry that people will be harmed especially parents unable to 
control drugdealing children 
if it happened to a middleclass person in their own house 
they would not lose their abode said american civil liberties 
union attorney loren siegel its picking on the most vulnerable 
people in society and creating a whole new group of homeless 
sometimes she said people not even suspected of wrongdoing are 
hurt the aclu is representing a woman and her children in 
peekskill ny ordered out when their building was seized as a 
suspected drug den 
but those directing the raids insist there is local support 
the people want it said vincent lane the chicago housing 
authoritys chairman i have received requests for sweeps from 
every development in the city 
and alexandria va mayor james moran agrees the strongest 
pressure im getting to clamp down harder is coming from the 
residents of public housing if it were up to them theyd have 
public executions in the courtyard 
alexandria has evicted 18 families from public and private 
housing after two controlled drug buys from each residence moran 
said 
we dont want to take any risk of evicting an innocent 
person he said we dont want to ruin it for the rest of the 
country 
moran said the city is compiling a public file of social 
security numbers of people evicted in drug cases and landlords can 
then deny them housing 
still the impact is limited he and others concede 
it nowhere near begins to really address the major problems of 
drugs said richard nelson director of the national association 
of housing and redevelopment officials that requires a lot more 
than pure enforcement pressure 
a similar criticism was made of the district of columbias plans 
for a juvenile curfew aimed at curbing drugrelated violence it 
was rejected in may by us district judge charles richey who 
called it a bull in a china shop of constitutional values 
other crackdown efforts such as prosecuting pregnant drug 
abusers have been denounced as senseless and damaging to those 
needing help 
theyre creating out of thin air a new crime the mothers 
failure to provide the perfect womb said lynn paltrow of the 
aclus reproductive freedom project 
the biggest effect of all this attention is to have a pregnant 
woman currently using any type of drug to shy away from going to a 
hospital and delivering said rockford ill attorney alberto 
altamore who represented a woman convicted of prenatal child 
abuse for using cocaine up to a few hours before birth 
but prosecutor logli responds it may be something that drives 
them underground or it may be the last straw that convinces them to 
do something about their own problem 
similar cases are emerging elsewhere in florida a woman who 
allegedly took cocaine during pregnancy is charged with child abuse 
and distributing drugs 
in a different type of gettough program criminal court judges 
in two tennessee counties have begun asking people convicted of 
possessing or selling drugs to name their supplier refusal could 
earn a contempt charge the progam is modeled after one in 
columbus neb 
this aggressive approach follows other controversial measures 
including widespread drug testing in industry and government and 
forefeiture laws in many places allowing property such as cars and 
boats to be seized from people accused but not convicted of drug 
offenses 
a survey of more than 1000 corporate members of the american 
management association found that in 1988 48 percent of companies 
tested for drugs compared with 21 percent in 1986 
while all of these steps have come under attack even critics 
understand the motive 
constituents clamor for politicians to solve the drug 
problem said arthur spitzer aclu legal director in washington 
but he cautions against quick fixes its a problem thats 
been a long time in coming he said and it will be a long time 
in going away

armed with batteries of computers and brigades 
of lawyers republicans and democrats are skirmishing for control 
of the political shakeup that offers the gop its onceinadecade 
opportunity to dent democratic control of congress 
if we want to be competitive in the house we have to get a 
good shake on redistricting said charles black the political 
consultant who is chairman of the republican national committees 
advisory committee on redistricting 
right now given the strength of incumbency there are only 
two times you get a chance to pick up any congressional seats he 
said one is when the seats are open and two is when you redraw 
the lines 
for republicans redistricting is a chance to break out of their 
depressing status as a seemingly permanent minority in the us 
house 
democrats control the house by a margin of 260 to 175 while 
voters in recent presidential elections have preferred republican 
candidates by landslide margins democrats now hold 18 more house 
seats than they did when ronald reagan was inaugurated in 1981 
democrats claim the capitals political split personality comes 
from voters desire to have congress act as a balance to gop 
presidents republicans claim the split is rooted the democrats 
drawing the lines for most current congressional districts 
redistricting is the onceadecade reshuffling of the nations 
congressional districts it is a threepronged battle technical 
political and legal 
every 10 years the us census counts everyone living in the 
country this time the day for the count is april 1 1990 
for politicians the most important census information is not 
how many americans there are but where they live for while the 
population increases the size of the us house remains at 435 
voting members 
by dec 31 1990 the census bureau will announce each states 
population and the bureau will reveal the reapportionment of the 
us house the number of representatives for each state based on 
a complicated mathematical formula 
then comes redistricting at the state level redrawing the 
boundaries of congressional districts to fit the new population 
gone are the days when cigarchomping politicians matched up 
census data with voting lists and redrew lines to help their 
friends and punish their enemies 
theyre still helping their friends and punishing their enemies 
but now the politicians do it with computers that produce highly 
sophisticated plans to can do in a legislator with subtle shifts of 
city blocks 
but computers have little value to politicians who dont have 
the votes to get their plan adopted 
the two parties are considered on a par technologically but the 
democrats control 28 state legislatures while republicans have 
only 8 in 13 states republicans control one legislative chamber 
and democrats the other nebraska has a unicameral nonpartisan 
legislature 
the other key players are governors 28 are democrats while 22 
are republicans 
elections this year and next will determine who controls 
redistricting in the states expected to gain or lose the most 
seats neither party is in control promising fierce battles for 
governor and legislative seats 
the 1990 census will certify the shift to the sunbelt that will 
have congress speaking with a decidedly more southern and western 
accent based on current estimates 17 house seats will head south 
and west 
california will be the big winner gaining six seats with an 
outside chance of picking up seven with 45 members in the current 
house california already has by far the largest congressional 
delegation 
other winners are florida expected to gain four house seats 
and texas likely to pick up three likely to gain one each are 
arizona georgia north carolina and virginia 
the losers are a familiar lineup mostly northern industrial 
states that have seen their congressional representation erode in 
recent decades 
if current trends hold new york will lose three seats and 
pennsylvania michigan ohio and illinois two each losing one each 
would be kansas iowa kentucky massachusetts west virginia and 
wisconsin 
with redistricting clout in the balance the highprofile races 
for governor are in california texas florida and illinois all 
of which are now in gop hands but george deukmejian of california 
and bill clements of texas are not running for reelection and bob 
martinez of florida is regarded as vulnerable jim thompson of 
illinois hasnt announced yet whether he will seek a fifth term as 
governor 
in addition the battle for control will be fought in countless 
legislative contests 
for example in michigan democrats would control the process if 
they capture the state senate where republicans have a narrow 
majority in pennsylvania republicans control one chamber by four 
seats and democrats the other by three 
after the politicians draw the district lines the battle will 
move to another arena the courts 
at some point in the 1980 process redistricting plans in all 
but three states ended up in court says kimball brace president 
of election data services a consulting firm that works on 
redistricting for democrats 
thus republicans and democrats are recruiting teams of lawyers 
to defend their plans or attack the oppositions in federal and 
state courts 
the guiding legal principle stems from the supreme courts one 
man one vote ruling that mandated that legislative districts be 
substantially equal in population 
brace cited a michigan plan that ended up in court republicans 
offered a plan with congressional districts differing in population 
by no more than four people but the court ruled in favor of the 
democrats plan which was drawn with each district identical in 
population 
how long do districts remain identical in population probably 
not more than a day or two after the census is taken

people are born people die people move 
those 18 michigan districts started out with a population of 
514560 each in 1980 as of july 1 1986 according to the census 
bureau the population of the 13th congressional district in 
detroit had declined to 444600 the fifth district which includes 
grand rapids had grown to 552000 
population isnt the only criteria in states with a history of 
racial bias redistricting plans must be cleared by the justice 
department to assure they dont discriminate against minorities 
whatever the process cries of gerrymander are certain to be 
heard across the land from politicians who didnt have the votes to 
get their own redistricting plan approved 
the term comes from massachusets gov elbridge gerry who is 
better remembered for the redistricting bill he signed in 1811 than 
for the fact that he also signed the declaration of independence 
the redistricting bill designed to help democrats and weaken 
federalists created a salamandershaped district that was 
immediately dubbed a gerrymander 
but the general rule is better to be accused of gerrymandering 
than to be gerrymandered 
republicans cried gerrymander frequently in the early 1980s 
pointing often at the most notorious recent example of the genre 
the california plan attributed to the late rep phil burton it 
redrew congressional lines in a manner that republicans claimed 
cost them five seats 
at the time the governor of california was a democrat and the 
party controlled both chambers of the legislature the republicans 
were nothing more than injured bystanders who appealed 
unsuccessfully to the courts for redress 
while republicans cry foul about democratic redistricting 
democrat ann lewis says the first partisan shot came from the gop 
the republicans of indiana began the redistricting year 
gloriously by using their political strength to eliminate one 
democratic congressman and endanger others said lewis then 
political director of the democratic national committee and the 
republican party spent the rest of the year complaining that 
democratic majorities were trying to act in a partisan fashion 
republicans entered 1981 with high hopes reagan had just taken 
office and dreams of a historic political realignment were dancing 
in gop heads the 1980 census had found a major shift of population 
from traditionally democratic industrial states to the more 
conservative sunbelt 
banks of computers were set up at the republican national 
committee as party leaders predicted technology would provide a 
substantial advantage 
but in state after state the democratic politicians outwitted 
the gops computers 
they had three computers 4 million and a staff of 40 said 
lewis i had two typewriters one and a half staff people and no 
budget allocation at all 
but i had more friends than they did i had more legislators 
than they did and ultimately we were able to produce more votes 
than they did 
rich bond a republican consultant and former rnc political 
director still gnashes his teeth when reminded of the 1981 
redistricting 
the republican national committee thought it had a technical 
edge and talked about it a lot and it flopped he said 
redistricting can be an unsettling experience for politicians 
who normally are among the nations most secure elected officials 
most congressmen while on the ballot every two years have what 
amount to tenyear terms for example 99 percent of the house 
members who sought another term in 1988 were reelected 
listen to tom hofeller redistricting expert for the house 
republican campaign committee 
youre not really a veteran in redistricting until youve sat 
down at a strategy session during the middle of the process and 
said we know were safe here they cant possibly screw us here 
and had the mack truck come and run right over you

when california voters elect a new governor in 
1990 they will shape the makeup of the us house for the rest of 
this century as well as the course of the 1992 presidential race 
its no wonder that republican party chairman lee atwater has 
declared that his main objective for 1990 is electing sen pete 
wilson governor of california 
were prepared to fight them tooth and toenail said 
democratic rep tony coelho of california 
rarely has a single state election had the potential national 
impact of the contest to succeed republican george deukmejian who 
opted against seeking a third term as governor 
the numbers tell part of the story 
already the nations most populous state california now has 45 
seats in the house and is expected to gain six or seven more after 
the 1990 census confirms the continuing shift of the nations 
population to the sunbelt 
that means california will have 53 or 54 of the 270 electoral 
votes needed to elect a president in 1992 in addition it is 
likely that the state will assert its influence on presidential 
nominating politics by moving its presidential primary to early 
march 
the initial advantage in the highstakes governors race went to 
the republicans when they convinced wilson to run for governor 
taking on another multimilliondollar race just after he won a 
second senate term in 1988 
on the democratic side party leaders would like without much 
realistic hope to avoid a bitter gubernatorial primary between 
state attorney general john van de kamp and former san francisco 
mayor dianne feinstein 
california is a major source of campaign contributions for 
politicians from all regions of the country but even its political 
largess could be strained in 1992 if wilson is elected governor 
if that happens wilsons appointed successor in the senate 
would have to run in 1992 for the final two years of the term and 
the seat now held by democrat sen alan cranston is up in 1992 as 
well 
california fundraisers shudder at the prospect of two senate 
races during a presidential year in which the state also will have 
six new house seats 
the big losers could be the large group of democratic senators 
elected in 1986 when the party regained control of the senate 
many of those democrats would like to raise thousands of dollars in 
california 
its certainly going to make us much more introspective 
said steve moses a major democratic fundraiser in southern 
california were all going to be focusing on ourselves we will 
not be as available to others 
on the other hand bob burkett an entertainment industry 
executive who also is an active democratic party fund raiser said 
the burst of activity would probably have little impact on 
californians who regularly give 25000 a year to political 
candidates 
i keep answering this question yes said republican 
businessman jack flanagan when asked if money could grow tighter 
for gop candidates yet we keep finding new donors 
while the impact of the governors race on fundraising is 
debatable theres no question of the redistricting stakes 
in 1981 when new district lines were drawn to conform to the 
1980 census california gained two new us house seats 
the democrats controlled the legislature and the governor was 
edmund g brown jr also a democrat 
the republicans were on the sidelines as the democrats rammed 
through a plan authored largely by the late rep phil burton 
that was credited with enabling his party to win five seats in the 
1982 elections 
with california picking up six or seven seats this time the 
stakes will be even higher 
the democrats still control the legislature but unless they can 
upset wilson theyll have to reach a compromise with the governor 
if we win the governors race and i think its very 
doable said coelho then we have the legislature and the 
governor and we go ahead and have a very smooth reapportionment 
from our point of view 
the congressman predicted that a republican governor would balk 
at any compromise with the legislature then the issue would be 
decided by the courts where many of the judges were appointed by 
ronald reagan 
they would do basically a republican plan coelho said of 
the courts 
should the gop come out way ahead in california and also pick up 
seats in states like texas and florida which also have republican 
governors coelho said it would have an impact on national 
legislation 
say we lose ten democrats you could have an impact on every 
bill we got through in the 8788 year because we barely got a lot 
of them through said coelho who was the chief democratic 
votecounter in the last congress

initial buyout offers for nwa inc have been 
rejected and suitors for the parent of northwest airlines have been 
given until june 16 to enhance their proposals 
none of the proposals is sufficiently more attractive than the 
others a fivemember review committee set up by nwas board of 
directors said monday in a letter to bidders 
the letter said each of the bids is subject to unacceptable 
material conditions it directed interested buyers to address 
regulatory concerns and asked for revised bids to propose 
compensation for nwa in the event it accepts an offer that later 
collapses 
bidders should specifically address their ability to 
consummate a transaction in light of financing and other 
conditions the letter said 
the committees letter also repeated a statement that there 
can be no assurance that a sale of nwa or any other transaction 
will result from nwas review of alternatives 
nwa stock tumbled 187 to close at 10687 a share in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading monday 
pan am corp which earlier made a proposal valued at 33 
billion was the only announced bidder to say immediately it would 
submit a revised bid but the company did not reveal details 
other known bidders are billionaire marvin davis whose 27 
billion offer earlier this year started the bidding process alfred 
checchi a los angeles investor who heads a group that includes klm 
royal dutch airlines and the australian holding company elders ixl 
ltd and northwests 20000member machinists union 
klm spokesman peter wellhuner said today that the dutch state 
airliner was not surprised by the move and is studying its options 
he said there is a good possibility the checchi group will 
get in touch again with northwest 
checchi would not comment on the rejection a spokesman for 
davis said the oil mogul would study the committees letter and 
for now will withhold any reaction to it guy cook president of 
the international association of machinists district lodge 143 did 
not return telephone calls seeking comment 
barbara beyer president of avmark inc an aviation consulting 
firm in arlington va said nwas move could be designed to 
broaden the scope of bidders for the nations fourthlargest 
airline suitors who were told the bidding would be conducted in a 
single round could by angered by such a development she said 
among those rumored as a possible suitor is the new york 
takeover firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which could now step 
in and make a bid if it missed the initial deadline beyer said 
a kkr spokesman has declined to say whether the company is a 
bidder the company continued its silence monday 
us transportation secretary samuel k skinner has informed nwa 
his department would review any proposed leveraged buyout of the 
airline to judge the financial fitness of the proposed new owner 
nwas review committee will meet with department officials to 
discuss skinners concerns the company said monday 
the committee said in its letter that suitors are welcome to 
meet with nwa management to seek more information about the 
airline based in the minneapolis suburb of eagan but the letter 
stressed that the meetings would not include negotiations 
you should be aware that no aspect of any of the proposals has 
been disclosed to members of nwa management the letter said 
the quote prompted rumors that nwa management led by chairman 
steven rothmeier was assembling its own buyout proposal said kurt 
rivard an analyst for dain bosworth inc of minneapolis but 
rivard said he doubted such a move was in the works 
rothmeier told reporters in april that no managementled buyout

both congress and the white house are 
expressing outrage at the violence in china but uschina farm 
trade appears to be continuing as usual 
i dont believe in using food as a weapon sen patrick 
leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee said 
monday with all that the chinese people are suffering we should 
not deprive them of food as well 
however the chinese government must not use our food as a 
weapon against its own people i know the world community would 
object to any attempt of the chinese government to restrict the 
flow of food to its people 
the agriculture department announced monday that china has 
bought another 18 million metric tons of soft red winter wheat 
from us farmers according to exporters that makes 265 million 
metric tons of the commodity bought for delivery in the marketing 
year that began june 1 
a metric ton is equal to about 2205 pounds and 367 bushels of 
wheat or 394 bushels of corn 
most of the chinese purchases were in the last two weeks 
according to the agriculture department 
during the marketing year that ended may 31 exporters sold 83 
million metric tons of us grain to china 
china also buys poultry to breed livestock semen hogs and seed 
to plant for animal feed according to the agriculture departments 
foreign agricultural service 
by far the largest commodity is grain said a spokeswoman in 
the department china gets other products from canada australia 
new zealand and europe she said 
since former president carters grain embargo against the soviet 
union for the december 1979 invasion of afghanistan the federal 
government has opposed using agricultural products as foreign 
policy weapons against countries 
but that doesnt mean it wont refuse to extend the export 
enhancement program to china 
the first 300000 metric tons of wheat purchased this year by 
china were under that discount program but all the rest has been 
bought at market prices 
we must be absolutely clear that chinas brutality against its 
own people is unacceptable said sen richard lugar rind 
ranking republican on the agriculture committee 
at the same time its important that us actions be moderate 
and targeted against the government rather than the people of 
china 
president bush said monday that weapons sales would be suspended 
and other aspects of bilateral relationship would be reviewed 
on the commercial side i dont want to hurt the chinese 
people bush said during a news conference i happen to believe 
that commercial contacts have led in essence to this quest for 
more freedom 
rep kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house 
agriculture committee said the united states should be committed 
never to use food embargoes as a weapon because they are 
ineffective and hurt both sides 
food embargoes are never the answer and particularly in this 
case it could worsen the pain and suffering of the chinese 
people he said

oats and oat products can be sold to canada 
without import licenses because the level of us government 
subsidies for oats is less than canadas the two countries have 
announced 
the governments announced monday that the us support level for 
oats is 874 percent while in canada it is 1109 percent 
under the free trade agreement signed between the two countries 
last year canada agreed to remove import licensing requirements if 
us support levels are equal to or less than those of canada 
supports are government subsidies that put a floor under prices 
the us mechanism for doing this is a pricesupport loan program 
under which farmers use crops as collateral and are free to forfeit 
and keep the money if that nets them a greater return than selling 
on the market 
import licenses will be required for wheat and barley the 
support comparisons for those commodities are wheat 6162 percent 
in the united states and 4628 percent in canada barley 7249 
percent in the united states and 5023 percent in canada

opec nations increased their oil 
production to 21 million barrels a day in may the highest output 
so far this year according to estimates released today 
the international energy agency also predicted in its monthly 
oil market report that demand for the cartels oil would rise in 
the second half of the year to about 2085 million barrels a day 
up from a previous estimate of 204 million barrels 
the ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries were meeting in vienna to set new price and 
production guidelines for the rest of the year the ministers 
opened their formal strategy meeting monday then adjourned to hold 
private bargaining sessions 
estimates of demand for their crude were heavily influencing 
discussions 
today mana saeed otaiba oil minister of the united arab 
emirates a persistent overproducer in the cartel said he would 
like to see opec boost its daily production to between 20 million 
and 21 million barrels from the current 185 million barrels 
otaiba refused to say how much hed like of the extra output 
the primary issue in the talks he said is to get everybody 
within the new umbrella of 20 or 20 plus million barrels a day as 
a new ceiling 
theres definitely movement toward an agreement said iraqs 
oil chief issam abdul raheem alchalabi but he did not elaborate 
no date was set for resumption of their formal talks 
anticipating more demand for their crude the ministers seemed 
intent on fixing a higher output ceiling of as much as 20 million 
barrels a day for the second half of the year 
the ministers also appeared to be leaning toward retaining their 
benchmark price of 18 a barrel saudi arabia has recommended 
discontinuing the target price 
the sticking point in their bargaining is how to divide up the 
extra output among the 13 countries kuwait and the united arab 
emirates want a bigger share of any increase 
the energy agencys report said opec production in may rose 
about 500000 barrels from april 
this was primarily the result of higher production in kuwait 
and nigeria partly offset by a small decline in iranian and 
ecuadorian production it said 
oil futures prices recently have been rising amid speculation 
about the outcome of the opec meeting other developments also 
helped drive up energy prices monday including the death of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the soviet gas pipeline explosion and 
turmoil in china 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for july 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude oil rose 38 cents to 2052 a barrel monday prices of 
refined products also rose

the chairman of the senate finance committee 
is asking his colleagues to scrap president bushs child care tax 
credit proposal in favor of a plan that would help parents pay for 
their childrens day care and health insurance 
in a memo sent to committee members monday and obtained by the 
associated press sen lloyd bentsen dtexas proposed making the 
current dependent care tax credit that is available to low and 
moderateincome families refundable in advance a new credit up 
to 500 a year would be created to help pay for health insurance 
for children under age 19 
bentsen said the proposal would cost the treasury 116 billion 
over the next five fiscal years 
he said the loss could be offset by added revenue the government 
will reap when tax credits now extended to troubled financial 
institutions expire next year and by making permanent the 3 percent 
federal telephone excise tax the phone tax is scheduled to drop to 
2 percent on jan 1 1990 
in the memo bentsen asked committee members to vote on the plan 
wednesday however because of other senate business he postponed 
that action until next week and called off a planned news 
conference at which he was to outline the legislation 
bentsens childrens initiative would replace the 25 
billion taxcredit plan offered by bush but is not intended to 
undermine a separate childcare bill sponsored by sen christopher 
dodd dconn 
senate aides said bentsen wanted his taxcredit package to be 
passed in conjunction with the final version of dodds bill 
the dodd bill would provide federal funds for more child care 
slots and set minimum federal standards for day care centers most 
republicans vigorously oppose the regulatory provisions of the dodd 
measure and senate aides said they believed bentsen wanted to keep 
his measure as separate legislation to improve its chances of 
passage unless a bipartisan agreement is reached on an overall 
childcare package the subject of current negotiations 
bentsen in the memo said making the existing dependent care 
credit refundable would provide cash for poor families who owe no 
taxes and who therefore would not benefit from a normal credit 
against tax liability 
bush in his childcare bill also suggested making the existing 
dependent care tax credit refundable 
the president also proposed a new tax credit of up to 1000 a 
child initially for families with incomes of between 8000 and 
13000 with the credit phasing in and by 1994 becoming available 
to familes with incomes of up to 20000 
in outlining that proposal to a house committee last month 
labor secretary elizabeth dole took a swipe at dodds plan 
the child care needs of working americans can best be met by 
providing assistance to parents not to providers through state 
and local regulations not federal standards through 
communitybased and publicprivate partnerships not federal 
bureaucracies and by parental involvement not federally mandated 
procedures 
critics of the bush plan while applauding the presidents 
motives have said that creating a new credit and making parents 
choose between it and the existing credit would only confuse 
parents and perhaps cause them to avail themselves of neither 
indeed a treasury department tax expert at the hearing with mrs 
dole had trouble explaining the mechanics of the bush proposal to 
the committee 
bentsen made no mention of the bush proposal in his memo but 
aides said he believed broader application of the existing credit 
was a better approach than creating a duplicative approach 
the new health insurance credit proposed by bentsen would allow 
families with incomes of 12000 or less to receive a tax credit 
for up to 50 percent of the cost of insurance premiums for a child 
under the age of 19 the maximum credit would be 500 families 
with incomes between 12000 and 21000 would be eligible for a 
reduced credit with the exact amount to be determined by income 
the health insurance credit which would become effective in 1991 
could be paid out in advance if the taxpayer desired the money up 
front 
bentsen also proposed allocating 25 million a year for the next 
five years through the department of health and human services 
for a program under which the federal government would pay up to 50 
percent of the costs of programs to provide basic health care to 
uninsured children under age 19 and their families

democratic forces running the country 
that could mean more fighting in china in the near future but 
traders were reassured by the possibility of peace there later on 
barbanel said

further consolidation

the european commission said tuesday it 
will consider whether to continue antidumping measures against 
us imports of propylene alcohol a propanederived product used 
in making printing ink paints and cosmetics 
the us producers of propylene alcohol are union carbide corp 
of danbury connecticut eastman chemical international co 
kingsport tenn which is part of eastman kodak co and hoechst 
celanese corp a subsidiary of west germanys hoechst ag 
current antidumping measures against imports of us propylene 
alcohol were first decided in april 1984 they were due to expire 
last year but will be kept in force until the new investigation is 
completed the european commission said 
according to a commission statement the antidumping case was 
reopened at the request of the european council of chemical 
industry federations cefic a brusselsbased group representing 
more than 80 percent of eec production of the chemical 
cefic has alleged that us producers export their product at 
about 10 percent below their internal market price according to 
european producers us production capacity of 92000 metric tons 
a year exceeds us internal demand by about 65000 tons 
cefic said us export of propylene alcohol to the eec has risen 
to 14762 tons in 1988 worth roughly 10 million from 6758 tons 
in 1985 even with the antidumping measures 
under the current measures the us companies have undertaken 
not to undercut european companies pricing in the eec

democrats and republicans bickered today over 
whether to repeal a tax law that businesses find burdensome as the 
senate struggled to complete a wideranging 33 billion spending 
bill 
as the senate began its third day of debate on the legislation 
sen robert kasten rwis offered an amendment repealing a 
section of the 1986 taxrevision law that he said has wreaked 
havoc on companies because of its complexity and costs 
democrats countered with a provision that conceded the tax 
requirement is onerous and urged its reworking by congress 
later in the year 
president bush first asked congress more than two months ago to 
provide extra money for this year for several federal agencies 
since then the measure has grown not only in size but in breadth 
attracting an assortment of amendments ranging from us policy in 
panama to work on an ohio lake 
kastens amendment revokes a requirement that businesses satisfy 
a complex test to prove that their health insurance plans are not 
more generous to upper echelon employees than they are to lowpaid 
workers companies have complained that the provision which took 
effect this year has created mounds of paperwork small businesses 
in particular have been unhappy 
kasten called the problem the no 1 domestic issue in america 
today in a written statement last week and his amendment was 
cosponsored by at least 13 other gop senators bush senate 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas and house ways 
and means committee chairman daniel rostenkowski dill have said 
the requirement needs to be reworked 
another amendment to be offered by sen john mccain rariz 
temporarily postpones the surtax now imposed on elderly americans 
as the price for new medicare coverage of catastrophic care senior 
citizens have complained about the expense which will cost a 
maximum of 850 in 1989 for the wealthiest americans over age 65 
bush initially requested the legislation in march seeking 22 
billion for veterans college students forest fire costs and other 
needs by the time the house passed the bill last month it had 
grown to 37 billion slightly surpassing the senates version 
in the senate the legislation has garnered a slew of amendments 
that range from the global to the parochial 
a provision added last week directs the army corps of engineers 
to spend 500000 this year on a project in mill creek lake in 
ohio the measure was sponsored by the states two democratic 
senators howard metzenbaum and john glenn 
the bill also picked up language sponsored by sen dan coats 
rind expressing the senates disinclination to approve a panama 
canal commission administrator named by panamanian ruler manuel 
antonio noriega by law the chief of government of panama can 
nominate a new chief for the agency in january that choice must be 
approved by the senate and by bush and the senate served notice it 
would not go along with the panamanian strongman 
the 1989 federal fiscal year runs through sept 30

rjr nabisco inc said tuesday it sold five of its 
european businesses to bsn a french food and beverage company for 
25 billion in an effort to reduce some of its debt from a record 
buyout 
bsn bought the united kingdom biscuit business of nabisco 
brands british snack food makers walkers crisps and smiths 
crisps the belin group a french biscuit and pastry business and 
saiwa a biscuit and snack producer in italy 
the five european companies had pretax profit of 137 million on 
sales of 12 billion in 1988 
rjr nabisco put the european units on the block last month 
saying the sales would be part of an effort to reduce the companys 
overall debt by about 55 billion 
in the wake of its 245 billion takeover by kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co completed earlier this year rjr has annual interest 
payments of about 3 billion 
the company has been expected to sell several assets in an 
attempt to reduce that debt 
emanuel goldman an analyst with painewebber inc in san 
francisco who follows rjr said the bsn deal demonstrates that 
there should be eager customers for any rjr units made available 
this indicates that indeed the rjr properties are hot 
properties he said it is one thing to project that and 
another to actually see it 
bsn and rjr are ranked one and two respectively in the biscuit 
and snack food business in france goldman said and the deal 
reinforces bsns powerhouse status at home 
bsn did not have a major presence in the united kingdom though 
rjr nabisco did goldman added all of a sudden they bsn are a 
big player in the british snack market he said 
bsn markets a variety of biscuit dairy and grocery products as 
well as beer champagne and mineral water 
bsn has acquired five attractive food businesses each 
possessing strong brands distribution and sales systems 
manufacturing facilities and management rjr chairman louis v 
gerstner jr said 
as part of bsn one of europes premier food and beverage 
companies these businesses should continue to develop and 
prosper he said 
gerstner said the sale while helping rjr reduce its debt will 
not diminish the companys competitive standing 
the size and strength of our food businesses in north america 
continue to place rjr nabisco among the worlds leading cookie 
cracker and snack producers he said

officials at the saudi aramco oil company reached by telephone 
from bahrain confirmed the report but refused to give details 
about its potential

officials said speaking on condition of anonymity 
as part of the program saudi aramco drilled a new wildcat well 
in the khurais region 125 miles southeast of riyadh the drillers 
hit a small amount of oil in a reservoir and had some gas shows

and commercially viable but the company officials declined to 
confirm or deny the report

risen to 252 billion barrels from 169 billion barrels its annual 
report for 1988 speculated that remaining reserves could be as high

paramount communications inc formerly known as 
gulf amp western inc said tuesday its secondquarter profit rose 18 
percent as strong results in entertainment and financial services 
more than offset seasonally weak results from educational 
publishing 
on a separate matter the company declined comment on a 
published report in usa today that paramount was weighing making a 
bid for time inc which is already in an agreement to merge with 
warner communications inc 
in trading on the new york stock exchange paramount was up 37 
cents a share at 3337 at midday while time was up 275 a share 
at 126 
in its earnings report paramount reported net income of 656 
million or 55 cents a share in the three months ended april 30 
compared with 555 million or 46 cents a share a year earlier 
the 1988 earnings results included a net gain of 48 million 
from the sale of the companys 30 percent interest in a 
videocassette duplication business 
secondquarter revenue rose 127 percent to 699 million from 
620 million a year earlier the revenue figures exclude results 
from the associates the consumer and commercial finance business 
that paramount put up for sale in april 
for the first six months of the year paramount said it earned 
1348 million or 113 a share up 12 percent from 1202 
million or 1 a share a year earlier 
sixmonth revenue excluding the associates rose 105 percent 
to 147 billion from 133 billion a year earlier 
paramount did not break out its quarterly and sixmonth revenue 
figures for the associates 
martin s davis chairman of paramount said he expects oprating 
income from entertainment and publishing this year would 
approximate the 432 million reported 1988 he said 1989 earnings 
including results from the associates to the date of its sale would 
exceed the 1988 total of 3847 million 
in the second quarter he said income from continuing operations 
included record contributions from the entertainment business due 
to sharp increases in paramount pictures operations and gains by 
its madison square garden unit 
the entertainment results included the success of the movie 
the naked gun from the files of police squad and the 
syndication of television show star trek the next generation 
and strong sales to pay cable services 
madison square garden operations benefitted from higher 
attendance at new york knickerbocker basketball games nba league 
expansion revenues and increased ticket sales at new york rangers 
hockey games which more than offset a decline at the msg network a 
cable service that had higher costs associated with the startup of 
its new york yankees cablecasts this spring 
publishing results reflected seasonal losses in educational 
operations which traditionally have their highest sales in the 
second half of the year

us employers must train workers more and better 
and reward enhanced skills to remain competitive internationally 
according to a study released tuesday by the american society for 
training and development 
the united states can educate and train employees outside the 
workplace until it is blue in the face but if employers do not 
design institutions and jobs that use and reward learning all 
efforts will make little difference the report said 
the study was released at the annual meeting here of the 
45yearold alexandria vabased society which represents nearly 
50000 professionals involved in employerbased training 
the group includes managers administrators educators and 
researchers who devise inhouse training their work ranges from 
teaching illiterate workers to read to improving sales and 
customer service skills to educating executives in running a 
company 
analysis of the available data and case studies of individual 
employers leads to the conclusion that employers current 
commitments to training and development are probably 
insufficient the report said 
it said that while learning in the workplace can boost 
individual opportunity and corporate competitiveness learning 
has a relatively low standing and low frequency in the american 
workplace 
citing federal bureau of labor statistics data the report said 
11 percent of american workers receive formal training and 14 
percent get informal onthejob training to prepare for jobs 
by the year 2000 the report said 65 percent of all jobs will 
require some training or education beyond high school compared 
with 54 per cent now 
the report recommended that 
employers set shortterm targets of spending 2 percent of 
payroll on formal training and increasing the proportion of workers 
tapped for extra training to nearly 15 percent from 10 percent 
now the longterm goal should be 4 percent of payroll costs to 
train 30 percent of employees 
the government create tax incentives to induce employers to 
improve the quality of worker training 
employers and educators join to raise the level of workplace 
training and education 
firms establish workplace incentives for advanced training 
through performancebased selection appraisal and rewards 
the study was the second in a month to warn that weak job 
training was hurting us productivity 
a twoyear massachusetts institute of technology study called 
made in america concluded that national proseprity was 
undermined by industrial weakness it recommended that companies 
offer workers more onthejob training and learning opportunities 
to improve productivity

douglas aircraft co became the latest big us 
company to pull expatriate workers from striferacked china today 
chartering a plane to withdraw its 51 people from shanghai and two 
other cities 
the move by the division of mcdonnell douglas corp a partner 
in a jointventure aircraft assembly plant outside shanghai was an 
aboutface from the companys position a day earlier when it said 
business was normal 
the company also became one of the first us businesses to 
charter a plane for evacuations and one of the first with big 
operations outside beijing to withdraw up to now most of the 
evacuees have been from the capital which has been in turmoil 
since the weekend when troops killed hundreds of civilians 
weve changed our situation in china we decided last night to 
begin pulling our people out of china back to hong kong douglas 
aircraft spokesman donald hanson said from company headquarters in 
long beach calif the situation apparently has changed 
overnight 
hanson said the companys 43 people based just outside shanghai 
seven people based in the southwest city of chengdu and one 
representative in the northeast industrial center of shenyang would 
leave as soon as possible 
many other us businesses that had reacted cautiously toward 
chinas political crisis also have been withdrawing workers from 
beijing and a growing number are becoming gloomy about the 
longerterm impact to their investments 
now with this random shooting in beijing its no longer fun 
anyone who approaches a window risks his life jerome cohen an 
international lawyer who helped pioneer the american business 
presence in china said monday 
with respect to our own staff i think it is time to withdraw 
for a while said cohen whose firm of paul weiss rifkind 
wharton amp garrison has offices in china until this weekend i 
thought that was unwarranted but now we have to think of peoples 
safety 
united airlines the only us carrier to beijing was heavily 
booked on its 400seat flight out of the capital today spokeswoman 
sara dornacker said 
by early this afternoon the airline had not added any flights 
although there were reports the us embassy in beijing was trying 
to charter planes to help evacuate american nationals 
ms dornacker said ual was continuing to deliberately delay the 
tokyobeijing leg of its regular ustobeijing flight by 15 hours 
to avoid an overnight layover in the capital fearing the airport 
might close 
northwest airlines spokesman kevin whalen said earlier that the 
airlines tokyoshanghai flight also was delayed to minimize ground 
time in shanghai just because the situation is so fluid there 
robert cox a senior executive of the international law firm of 
baker amp mckenzie said his chinabased staffers had left for hong 
kong because of the concern for personal safety and clients are 
dealing with the situation there the same as we are 
the implications of this are profound cox said i dont 
see how anyone doing business there couldnt set those plans in a 
state of suspension 
us business reaction to the chaos in china is particularly

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade with wheat prices falling 
despite announcement of a major sale to the peoples republic of 
china 
mondays announcement that china purchased 185 million metric 
tons of wheat was expected to be a boost to prices but that didnt 
happen 
the sale was already factored into the market so there was 
some liquidation said jon horton an analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
horton noted that there was also some commercial selling of 
wheat futures because of a lack of business 
there is so much uncertainty in china people arent willing 
to pay 4 a bushel for wheat which what it was getting to he 
said 
corn prices dropped in a spillover from the sale of wheat 
futures despite word from the agriculture department that recent 
severe weather in ohio could prevent planting of about 50 percent 
of that states planned corn crop 
soybean prices fell as investors purchased old crop futures and 
sold new crop analysts say the strong dollar is expected to 
continue to hamper export sales 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 392 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to cent higher with july at 263 a bushel oats were 2

eastern airlines union leaders told striking 
workers tuesday to remain optimistic about a possible buyout but 
the troubled carrier said the prospects of a deal were dead 
a federal bankruptcy judge monday said eastern should begin 
negotiating on plans to reorganize as a smaller carrier after an 
investor group led by the unions and a chicago businessman failed 
to put together a takeover deal 
the fat lady just sang eastern spokesman jim ashlock said 
i can tell you its absolutely untrue frank ortis vice 
president of the machinists local told members at the union hall 
who gathered to discuss apparent bad news in their threemonthold 
strike so lets hang in there 
eastern said the ruling by bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
ended buyout possibilities by chiacgo commodities trader joseph 
ritchie and the unions who nonetheless maintained it was alive 
joel zweibel the attorney for the committee representing major 
creditors said in court the proposal was interesting and 
constructive but wouldnt be possible without eastern approval 
the group met saturday with representatives of eastern parent 
texas air corp but failed to win support for the buyout plan 
which included a 100 million equity investment and 210 million in 
union wage concessions 
the judge directed eastern to begin talks with creditors over 
the companys plan to sell 18 billion in assets and reorganize in 
bankruptcy court as a smaller carrier 
lifland said the ritchie group could continue discussing its 
offer with creditors but that the court no longer would consider 
it unless it was acceptable to eastern 
its always there in the minds of some who would like to keep 
it alive eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said but added 
there are no buyers out there 
but pilots union spokesman ron cole countered that lifland did 
not kill the ritchie bid or give approval to the texas air chairman 
frank lorenzos awaited reorganization plan 
cole said the unions believe the creditors will reject the 
rebuilding plan which focuses on mass asset sales the union says 
would leave eastern too crippled to compete 
the unions also contend that management wont be able to hire 
enough qualified pilots and mechanics 
we dont think mr lorenzo is going to find enough 
professional people to put his airline back without the unions 
said wally haber a machinists general chairman hes got people 
out there but theyre round pegs for square holes 
the pilots union urged its members not to make any rash 
decisions based on what the union called inaccurate information 
from news reports about liflands ruling 
ritchie set a meeting for wednesday in washington between his 
group and david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner for 
eastern 
i thought the unions were grasping at straws said mark 
daugherty a dean witter reynolds inc analyst i think its 
pretty much dead now 
eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on march 9 
five days after pilots and flight attendants joined striking ground 
workers represented by the machinists union in a walkout that 
virtually grounded the airline 
under bankruptcy law eastern has the exclusive right until 
early july to submit a reorganization plan easterns lead 
attorney harvey miller said monday that eastern probably would 
propose its plan within two to three weeks 
eastern already has discussed an outline of a reorganization 
scheme with the creditors committee miller said

two brothers have been indicted on charges of 
stealing more than 17 million in equipment leasing schemes 
involving bell atlantic systems and morgan guaranty trust co 
officials said tuesday 
the manhattan district attorneys office said a 17count 
indictment charged tuvia ted stern 27 and ephraim stern 34 
of brooklyn with illegal use of a legal taxsaving device last 
year 
the sterns sold printing equipment from two companies they owned 
to bell so they could generate a cash profit they then leased back 
the equipment so they could use it while writing off the lease cost 
as a business expense according to the indictment 
if the sterns had kept the equipment in the first place the 
only financial advantage would have been the annual depreciation 
for taxes 
such transactions are legal but the indictment said the sterns 
sold property to bell that was greatly overvalued and in some 
instances was owned by others and in some instances did not exist 
in one case according to assistant district attorney george 
donahue the sterns bought the mayflower printing co in june 1988 
for 50000 and sold it and nonexistent assets to bell atlantic for 
600000 a few months later 
to keep the scheme going the sterns allegedly used phony 
financial statements and invoices and fictitious eople 
in another case the sterns used their lawyers bank account to 
steal 265000 from morgan guaranty donahue said 
the sterns aface up to 25 years in jail if convicted of the top 
count of firstdegree grand larceny

energy futures prices weakened slightly tuesday 
as opec ministers struggled to reach an agreement on raising crude 
oil production 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for july 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude oil dipped 6 cents to 2046 per 42gallon barrel following 
mondays rise of 38 cents prices of refined petroleum products 
posted larger declines 
the crude contract held up well given the developments at the 
conference of ministers representing the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries said chris mccormack an energy broker at 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
all the news to me seems to be bearish the bickering among 
members about production quotas and allocations was a negative 
influence on energy prices said mccormack 
negotiations among the cartel ministers meeting in vienna bogged 
down tuesday as they tried to agree on allotting a proposed 
cartelwide oil production increase among its 13 member nations 
some members are believed to favor dividing any additional 
production evenly but kuwait apparently has demanded a larger share 
while several other countries would like special treatment 
on production the ministers are considering a proposal to 
increase the cartels output ceiling from the current 185 million 
barrels a day to 195 million in the julydecember period 
the united arab emirates however favors a boost to between 20 
million barrels and 21 million barrels 
as the opec discussions were taking place a new report was 
released which estimated that current production by opec members 
far exceeds the selfimposed quota 
the international energy agency said opec nations produced oil 
at a daily rate of 21 million barrels last month the highest 
amount so far this year 
energy market analysts said the violence in china and the 
problems stemming from the explosion of a natural gas pipeline in 
the soviet union had little impact on prices tuesday these events 
had been among the factors responsible for mondays gains 
the july contract for no 2 heating oil which rose 187 cents 
monday fell 091 cent to 5100 cents a gallon on the new york 
mercantile exchange the contract for july delivery of unleaded 
gasoline settled at 6494 cents a gallon off 086 cent almost 
erasing mondays increase of 095 cent

five european aerospace companies have decided to 
develop a new generation of military transport aircraft for the late 
1990s frances aerospatiale said tuesday 
henri martre chairman of the stateowned company said the 
european companies have decided to form a new industrial alliance 
called european future large aircraft group or euroflag the group 
will study a new military plane to replace the aging francogerman 
transall and the c130 hercules made by lockheedgeorgia co of the 
united states he said 
in addition to aerospatiale the companies associated in euroflag 
are british aerospace plc messerschmittboelkowblohm gmbh of west 
germany casa of spain and italys aeritalia the first four 
companies are already partners in airbus industrie the european 
consortium that builds the airbus family of commercial jets 
martre told reporters the agreement effectively puts an end to a 
previous accord called future international military airlifter or 
fima in which the same five european companies were associated with 
lockheed 
the new consortium will continue to have relations with lockheed 
such as consulting on market surveys martre said but the group 
will also be talking to other us aircraft manufacturers 
the european companies and lockheed have been carrying out 
preliminary studies of a new military transport aircraft for several 
years in anticipation of natos need to find a successor to the 
hercules and the transall which is made jointly by aerospatiale and 
west germanys mbb 
but nato has so far failed to come up with any definition of the 
kind of the aircraft that it requires 
industry observers said the europeans decided to take advantage 
of the uncertainty surrounding natos intentions to break their 
formal ties with lockheed 
the decision means they will be able to link up with the us 
company that is eventually selected to produce the american version 
of the aircraft

opec negotiations stalled tuesday as 
cartel ministers tried to hammer out an agreement on how to allot a 
proposed cartelwide production increase among its 13 member 
nations 
i can certainly say theres a spirit of reaching an 
understanding but a lot of work needs to be done said 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 
its a deadlock said a delegate from one nation who 
demanded anonymity 
continuing talks over a possible hike in the official production 
ceiling came as a new report indicated the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries lifted output in may to its highest 
level of the year surpassing its current ceiling 
an offical of one delegation said a proposal had been made to 
raise the cartels output ceiling from the current 185 million 
barrels a day to 195 million in the julydecember period 
the additional production would be divided proportionately among 
all members said the official who demanded anonymity 
kuwait has insisted on a larger share and several other 
countries would like special treatment 
the united arab emirates mana saeed otaiba told reporters he 
wanted opec to boost its daily production limit to between 20 
million barrels and 21 million barrels 
the nation persistently has pumped more than its individual 
quota although otaiba refused to say how much he would like of the 
proposed additional cartel output as much as we can get we would 
love to have he said 
the key issue is to get everybody within the new umbrella of 
20 or 20 plus million barrels a day as a new ceiling said 
otaiba 
other members have said no country should be given more output 
than others 
libyas fawzi shakshuki said if another country wins special 
treatment libya will ask for that 
the opec ministers have been trying to resolve their disputes 
since last friday they opened a formal strategy conference monday 
before returning to private bargaining 
opec nations agreed last november on a production ceiling of 
185 million barrels a day for the januaryjune period well under 
actual output levels of that time in an attempt to support a price 
of 18 a barrel for their oil 
prices have risen since then with the price of a basket of 
crudes monitored by opec now more than 40 percent above the level 
of late november 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for july 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark american crude 
closed down 6 cents tuesday at 2046 a 42gallon barrel 
the ministers apparently have settled on retaining the 18 
benchmark although saudi arabia had recommended scrapping the 
target price 
opec seems to be happy with a pricing level around 18 said 
otaiba 
separately the international energy agency reported the opec 
nations lifted their crude production by 500000 barrels a day in 
may to 21 million barrels the highest amount so far this year 
higher production by kuwait and nigeria accounted for much of 
the may increase it said 
the agencys monthly oil market report estimated saudi arabia 
produced 48 million barrels a day in may its opecset supply 
quota is 45 million barrels a day 
iran and iraq each produced about 28 million barrels a day in 
may it said 
the output for kuwait and the united arab emirates was estimated 
at 16 million barrels a day well above their opec supply quotas 
of about a million barrels a day 
nigeria produced some 16 million barrels a day ahead of its 
supply target of about 14 million barrels 
the report estimated venezuelas production at 16 million 
barrels a day the same as its quota and ecuadors at 300000 
barrels up from its quota of 230000 barrels 
other production estimates were libya 1 million barrels 
algeria 700000 barrels indonesia 12 million barrels libya 1 
million barrels and gabon 200000 barrels

alaskas governor and tourism officials fearing 
that americans picture their state as a soiled paradise since the 
biggest oil spill in us history began a damagecontrol tour 
tuesday to promote the vast reaches unaffected by the disaster 
if you went to alaska and if you wanted to see the oil you 
would have to go to a pretty substantial expense and a lot of 
trouble to do so gov steve cowper told a news conference 
tourism is a 750 millionayear industry for alaska and ranks 
behind only oil and seafood among the states biggest industries 
dow said 
cowper and other alaska officials emphasized that as large as the 
march 24 spill was it was virtually lost amid the states huge 
unaffected expanses of land and water 
cowpwr said the spill affected only 2 percent of alaskas 6640 
miles of coastline that included just 5 percent of the shoreline 
within prince william sound where the tanker exxon valdez ran 
aground and spilled 109 million gallons of crude 
thomas m dow president of the alaska visitors association a 
tourism industry group showed slides taken since the spill 
portraying untouched beaches within the sound a cruise ship 
crossing the sound and sea lions in the area where the spill 
drifted 
theres no hiding from the fact that its been a tragedy dow 
said but for visitors few if any will see its impacts on these 
remote areas 
officials have no firm projections how many potential visitors 
may be deterred by the oil spill but sportfishing lodge operators 
have reported inquiries from their customers and some outright 
reservation cancellations cowper said 
like commercial fishermen tour operators and others in tourism 
will be entitled to compensation from exxon if they can show damages 
as a result of the spill cowper said 
the state spent 108 million on tourism promotion in 1988 and 
the legislature budgeted 114 million for this year 
this years budget is supplemented by 4 million from exxon part 
of which is financing this weeks promotion trip to seattle and new 
york as well as print and television advertising 
one of the ads shows a picture of a smiling marilyn monroe 
without her beauty mark without it the picture may have changed 
but her beauty hasnt the ad reads the same is true of 
alaska 
in addition 154000 copies of a letter from cowper were sent to 
people who had inquired about visiting alaska assuring them the oil 
spill would not affect their travel plans 
before the spill alaska tourism officials predicted just over 
780000 people would visit the state this season its 30th 
anniversary of statehood that would have been up from 709664 in 
1988 and would match 1986 the best year ever when a number of 
visitors to british columbias expo 86 worlds fair included alaska 
in their tours 
some visitors may be drawn to alaska because of publicity about 
the spill and the environmental damage it wrought officials said 
some entrepreneurs may even arrange tours of oilfouled areas 
dow predicted 
i think its probably correct to say were getting people up 
there who want to see the oil spill cowper said but he added 
theyre going to have a hard time

share of preferred stock 
cnw stock jumped 75 cents to close at 4750 a share new york 
stock exchange composite trading 
employees and customers of cnw will benefit from the fact that 
our business plan calls for upgrading cnws most strategically 
important line does not depend upon the sale of operating assets 
and continues cnws role as a provider of quality transportation 
services said cnw chairman and chief executive officer robert 
schmiege who leads the management contingent of the buyout group 
new yorkbased japonica partners which had been pursuing a 44 a 
share hostile takeover valued at 722 million issued a statement 
saying it was terminating its tender offer the group is cnws 
largest shareholder with an 88 percent stake 
japonica partners and its affiliates intend to evaluate their 
alternatives which may include the disposition of some or all of 
the cnw common shares benefically owned by them or holding some or 
all of such shares for sale pursuant to the merger agreement the 
statement read 
based on approximately 19 million cnw shares outstanding and the 
assumption of cnw debt the management group valued its buyout plan 
at 16 billion 
new yorks chemical bank has committed 585 million in buyout 
financing and the new york investment firm donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette inc has committed to provide up to 475 million in 
financing 
blackstone will hold a controlling interest in cnw under the 
agreement with minority positions held by management and donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette 
union pacific the railroad and trucking company will hold 100 
million of stock that will be convertible into a minority position 
after five years 
officials said blackstones financing structure will not require 
significant sales of operating assets to retire the debt caused by 
the takeover but the firm will complete cnws previously announced 
plan to sell its chicagoarea commuter operations and will divest 
some real estate and surplus equipment 
japonica planned to sell cnws real estate excess equipment and 
chicagoarea commuter lines if its takeover bid succeeded 
cnw is the parent of the chicago and north western transportation 
co a 6000mile railroad with 8500 employees that operates in 
nine states most of them in the midwest 
union pacific owns bethlehem pabased union pacific railroad 
which has some 21000 route miles all west of the mississippi river 
union pacific relies heavily on the north westerns 
chicagotofremont neb line for eastwest freight traffic and 
accounts for about 40 percent of the north westerns shipments 
analysts say 
we wanted to insure reliable and effective service to our 
customers into and out of chicago union pacific spokesman harvey 
turner said of the takeover agreement in a telephone interview 
cnw has agreed with union pacific to spend 115 million through 
1992 to maintain and upgrade cnws eastwest main line in order to 
improve rail quality and shorten delivery times 
union pacific recently paid 15 million for an option to buy the 
iowa interstate railroad a regional line between iowa and chicago 
officials said the line would have served as a substitute for the 
north western had a hostile takeover disrupted freight service 
the offer by the blackstoneled group was approved by a special 
cnw board committee that was evaluating bids for the chicagobased 
rail company 
cnws union on friday made a proposal to buy the company that 
would have given employees a onethird stake in the railroad union 
officials did not immedately return telephone calls seeking comment

nintendo co is developing a plan that could use the machines 
that run its popular video games as part of a network for delivering 
information to us households a spokeswoman for the company said

up to television sets to display such hit nintendo games as super 
mario brothers 2 zelda ii and mike tysons punchout

third world countries are falling behind on 
7067 billion worth of debt to us banks according to the general 
accounting office 
the gao which reports investigations to congress did not name 
the countries argentina the number three debtor after brazil and 
mexico has paid no interest on its foreign debt for over a year 
the gao said us bank regulators should make banks put up more 
reserves to protect their depositors against losses on those loans 
it calculated that the regulators now demand reserves of only 51 
percent about 36 billion it suggested that they should be 
insisting on 622 percent nearly 44 billion 
because banks generally respond to reserve requirements by 
writing down assets by the required amounts a decline in ther book 
value of their assets results the office said in a recent note on 
figures to rep john j lafalce a member of the banking committee 
though the gao did not say so writing down a banks assets 
reduces the amount of business it can do and makes the management 
look bad to depositors and stockholders 
in a letter tuesday to federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
lafalce said the banks should put up more reserves us banks 
maintain lower reserve levels than almost all other industrialized 
countries lafalce wrote 
a bank is now only required to put up reserves when the 
regulators declare foreign loans it has made to be either a total 
loss or valueimpaired that means the debtors have not paid 
interest for six months or otherwise shown that they are in deep 
trouble 
us bank regulators next week are expected to discuss behind 
closed doors whether to classify loans to argentina as 
valueimpaired 
the category already contains poland bolivia peru zaire 
sudan nicaragua and liberia but their total debt is small compared 
with the major debtors brazil mexico and argentina 
us authorities calculate that argentina owes us banks more 
than 85 billion argentina has not paid interest for more than a 
year on its foreign debt now estimated at over 60 billion 
the gao thinks that the bank regulators should insist that the 
crediotr banks put aside reserves proportional to the price that a 
countrys debt will fetch on the open market

officials launched a petition drive tuesday 
to keep chrysler corps jeep plant in toledo after a contract 
between the united auto workers and chrysler expires in 1992 
democratic city council candidate carty finkbeiner who is 
leading the drive said volunteers will try to collect 200000 
signatures from people asking chrysler to keep the plant open 
local labor leaders are helping to organize the petition drive 
finkbeinder said a convoy of jeeps will travel to chrysler in 
detroit in the fall to deliver the petitions with the message 
manufacturing is not dead in toledo long live manufacturing in 
toledo long live jeep 
some automotive industry analysts predict chrysler will close the 
jeep plant when the current contract expires or in the mid1990s 
when production of a new generation of jeeps begins at the companys 
new detroit plant 
chrysler has said it will continue to produce the jeep cherokee 
which dominates the sport utility market at the toledo plant as 
long as it continues to sell 
company officials also have said they will negotiate a new 
contract with uaw local 12 when the current accord expires 
as far as chrysler is concerned the petition drive isnt 
necessary because we have that agreement until 1992 which is a long 
time in the auto industry chrysler spokesman doug nicholl said

congressional efforts to force the 
nations thrifts to meet stringent capital requirements would push 
almost onethird of the industry into insolvency and keep home 
mortgage rates above 10 percent the chief economist for a trade 
association said tuesday 
james christian director of the economics department for the 
us league of savings institutions told texas thrift executives 
that as many as 973 thrifts with 768 billion in assets would fail 
to meet requirements that they maintain 3 percent tangible capital 
the industry has been pushing for capital requirements which 
either include goodwill the amount of net worth above the 
value of tangible assets or a severalyear period to transform the 
goodwill into money 
opponents have objected to including goodwill because it is 
intangible 
speaking at the 1989 texas savings and loan league convention 
christian said many lawmakers apparently feel more is better and 
tougher is what they want to do but he said it is a mistake if 
you have to kill a third of the industry in order to get this done 
the day after tomorrow 
christian said more stringent capital requirements would force 
institutions to shrink causing them to sell off mortgages which in 
turn would tighten the market and keep interest rates high he 
predicted home mortgage rates will average 11 percent this year 
falling only slightly to 106 percent by 1991 
but christian said the 2000 remaining thrifts that would not be 
affected by the more stringent requirements are plain vanilla 
housing lenders for the most part always have been 
critics have blamed much of the industrys problems on savings 
and loans that strayed too far from their roots as home lenders 
this year alone regulators have placed more than 200 thrifts 
under their control awaiting passage of legislation that would 
provide more than 157 billion over the next 10 years to rescue the 
industry 
the us house favors the more stringent capital requirements 
but the legislation is not expected to come up for a floor vote 
before next week as the house rules committee sifts through more 
than 100 amendments 
in other forecasts christian said the current business 
expansion already the nations longest during peacetime could 
continue at moderate levels for up to two years but for that to 
happen he said the federal reserve system must stop worrying about 
inflation 
until recently the fed has been pushing up interest rates to 
keep inflation under control but christian said world markets are 
forcing the fed to rethink that strategy through the strength of the 
dollar 
christian said the inflation rate will rise to 48 percent this 
year before falling to 40 percent by 1991 
later m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board told the group that figures to be released wednesday indicate 
the evaporation of deposits from the nations thrifts continued to 
decline in april a traditionally down month as taxpayers pay uncle 
sam 
in april 1988 thrift deposits grew by 12 billion as investors 
shifted money from uncertain stock and mutual fund investments so 
far this year however 285 billion has been withdrawn from 
thrifts including a record 108 billion in january 
wall also said that a secret survey by the bank board found some 
southwest plan thrifts not doing enough to sell distressed real 
estate 
most federal regulators who have visited texas in recent months 
have taken pains to reassure local officials that the government 
will not dump on the market properties acquired through the rescue 
of hundreds of savings and loans and banks 
but wall told reporters tuesday the bank board had sent 
shoppers into texas and discovered that some of the properties 
held by institutions recapitalized last year through the southwest 
plan had not even been listed for sale 
wall suggested that the southwest plan thrifts which were 
created last year through the consolidation and sale of ailing 
institutions may have taken the no dumping promise too 
literally

prime computer inc has dropped its appeal to the 
1st us circuit court of appeals seeking to enjoin mai basic four 
incs unsolicited takeover bid because mais recent revision of its 
offer made the appeal irrelevant 
it no longer made sense to pursue that deal prime spokesman 
joseph gavaghan said tuesday 
gavaghan said mais offer of 1950 cash per share would actually 
be 1480 per share on a fully diluted basis and does not reflect 
the intrinsic value of the company prime is encouraging 
stockholders to resist mais offer he said 
primes board of directors postponed the companys annual 
stockholders meeting from june 14 to july 26 to provide for an 
orderly active and effective exploration of all financial 
alternatives officials said in a statement tuesday 
primes board has said it is discussing acquisition possibilities 
with interested parties and is contemplating a possible 
recapitalization 
on monday mai officials said primes consideration of other 
takeover offers was a a deliberate attempt to confuse prime 
stockholders 
last thursday mai lowered its tender offer 50 cents a share 
because of primes projected results in 1989 and 1990 
mai which is about onefourth the size of prime which is based 
in the boston suburb of natick owns about 12 million shares of 
prime stock since it launched its hostile bid in november 333 
million shares were tendered under the 20 offer representing 
nearly 70 percent of the outstanding shares and just under 50 
percent of primes stock on a fully diluted basis 
gavaghan said primes executive council has agreed to meet with 
mai chairman bennett lebow at an unspecified future date
