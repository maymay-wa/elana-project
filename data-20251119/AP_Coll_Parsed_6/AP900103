to his followers gen manuel antonio noriega was a living 
breathing symbol of panamanian nationalism a brave david standing 
firm against the imperialist goliath of washington 
his detractors viewed panamas supreme leader as an 
unscrupulous despot who stood ready to drag the country down with 
him 
as far as the white house is concerned noriega is a criminal a 
man who enriched himself by selling his country to colombian drug 
traffickers 
noriega was indicted on us drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges in february 1988 he denied the charges 
washington imposed sanctions against panama in its efforts to 
dislodge the general from power 
noriega in command since 1983 to the bane of two us 
presidents wouldnt budge 
as unemployment rose food lines lengthened and hundreds of 
business people declared bankruptcy the general stood fast 
he had a whipping boy the united states which he could blame 
for all of panamas ills the indictments the sanctions were all 
part of a us plot to renege on a 1978 treaty granting panama 
sovereignty over the canal by the year 2000 he said 
his face contorted noriega brandished a machete above his head 
then brought it crashing down on the podium in front of him 
ni un paso atras he shouted and his friendly audience on 
its feet now took up the chant ni un paso atras ni un paso 
atras 
the spanish words mean not one step back and long before 
that speech on may 1 1988 on international labor day they had 
become noriegas rallying cry in his struggle to retain power 
he reveled in thumbing his nose at the united states which he 
called the colossus of the north 
when elections apparently were going against him in may 1989 he 
abruptly had them annulled for a time he had his own handpicked 
man as provisional president 
on dec 15 less than a week before his world was to come 
crashing down his rubberstamp assembly named his chief of 
government that formally gave noriega civilian powers to go with 
the military clout he had long possessed and which made him the 
most powerful man in panama 
the assembly said his leadership was needed to confront a 
state of war caused by us sanctions and other efforts to 
drive out noriega 
on dec 20 shortly after incidents in which a us marine 
lieutenant was killed and in which according to president bush a 
us navy couple was abused us troops invaded panama and noriega 
fled into hiding 
on christmas eve the former strongman sought sanctuary in the 
vatican embassy sanctuary he finally yielded late wednesday 
the general was a shrewd tough child of poverty schooled in 
intrigue his foes in the military tried coups against him and 
failed the last attempt was last oct 3 the leaders were executed 
noriega was born in panama citys el chorrillo district and 
raised by foster parents his official biography indicates he is 
about 51 but the date in his high school yearbook would make him 
54 he joined the defense forces in 1962 
he became head of the defense forces chief of panamas military 
and police through his loyalty to his predecessor and mentor gen 
omar torrijos noriega a short jowly pockmarked man called 
pineapple face by his detractors never possessed the charisma 
of his populist mentor but he was backed by the democratic 
republican party which torrijos founded 
noriega had little faith in the ability of civilians to rule 
our young officers are much better prepared to govern when 
panama takes over the panama canal operations in the year 2000 
he once said in an interview 
 
the handsome charismatic torrijos changed the defense forces 
from an organization led by the social elite into a tightly 
disciplined force of 15000 with absolute police military and 
political power 
he opened the upper ranks to the lower economic classes and 
created a base of power from a new generation of officers noriega 
a poor boy who went to military school in peru on a scholarship 
was among them 
less than a year after taking power in a coup in 1968 torrijos 
made noriega an obscure provincial lieutenant with only four years 
of military service his chief of intelligence 
noriega quickly began collecting dossiers on everyone who 
counted in panama friends and enemies alike he developed close 
ties with us intelligence agencies interested in any potential 
threat to the security of the panama canal a major shipping link 
between the atlantic and pacific oceans 
 
torrijos also gave noriega jurisdiction over customs and 
immigration long a source of funds for the military 
 
after torrijos died in an unexplained plane crash in 1981 it 
took noriega about two years to shoulder his way to the top 
command once there noriega boldly exercised his power and 
tolerated little opposition 
he closed the private news media for months at a time for 
alleged offenses ranging from personal insults to incitment to 
disobedience unhappy with the outcome of the first popular 
election in 16 years noriega installed his own president in 1984 
he was long the ally of the united states but washington began 
to distance itself from him after the headless body of a noriega 
foe hugh spadadora was found in a us mailbag in costa rica in 
1985 the final break came three years later with the us grand 
jury drug indictments in florida 
noriega worked hard to develop the image of a man of the people 
his private life was that of a rich man but publicly he stressed 
his humble origins and spent weekends courting the residents of 
rural towns and villages 
with the deepening of his political crisis noriega tried to use 
his popular image to build support in this nation of 22 million 
people many of them black and mulatto 
 
the humble the poor the blacks they are the utmost 
authority of this people he said in one speech 
 
his official salary was 60000 a year but in addition to drug 
smuggling he was said to have his finger in a wide range of 
enterprises among them were dutyfree liquor stores maritime 
services banks gambling casinos newspapers a television station 
and 12 radio stations he lived in a twostory colonialstyle 
mansion in one of panamas most exclusive neighborhoods and 
maintained a fleet of expensive cars 
noriega is married and has three children including a daughter 
who lives in the dominican republic

panamanians hugged american soldiers 
and danced in the streets as fireworks burst in the the sky 
wednesday night when word spread that gen manuel antonio noriega 
had surrendered to us troops 
thank god panama can now feel like a free country i feel 
free now said 20yearold moises rios 
sheer jubilation gripped the capital of 1 million residents just 
seconds after radio and television announced the former strongman 
had abandoned his vatican embassy sanctuary after a 10day siege 
is it official is he really gone many disbelievers asked 
reporters 
panamanians spilled into the streets laughing banging pots and 
pans and applauding hundreds converged on avenida balboa where 
the vatican mission was framed in a burst of fireworks 
its over its over people shouted some screaming 
themselves hoarse 
cars careened down streets and boulevards blaring their horns 
and causing traffic jams more mindful of rush hour than a national 
celebration residents ran up to the us military roadblocks and 
hugged and kissed us soldiers 
we are relieved to be rid of this criminal the important 
thing was that he should leave our national territory its a great 
moment said president guillermo endara we have to feel happy 
god has blessed us in these last few days 
groups of youngsters ran up and down neighborhood streets waving 
panamanian and american flags vatican embassy officials said 
noriega left the compound of his own will and was dressed in 
his generals uniform 
he was flown off in an army helicopter to florida where he 
faces drug trafficking charges

an 82yearold man shot two sheriffs 
deputies to death in the back of the head tuesday as they gave him 
a ride after he had been in a car crash authorities said 
ule reynolds of gary ind who has a criminal record dating 
back 45 years was being held without bond on two firstdegree 
murder charges late tuesday in the jail in neighboring tipton 
county police also were investigating weapons charges 
we do this all the time give people a ride who have 
trouble said lauderdale county deputy sheriff bill danley he 
was not under arrest they were just giving him a ride 
police planned to interview reynolds wednesday said sheriff 
milford durham we tried to talk to him today and we couldnt 
make any sense out of what he was saying he said 
we transferred him to tipton for both his protection and 
ours durham said there are bad feelings about this 
reynolds car had run into a ditch off state highway 51 about 60 
miles north of memphis early tuesday morning 
the slain deputies kevin ward 29 and bobby nolen 55 
apparently felt no reason to check the man for a weapon before 
giving him the ride since he was not suspected of any criminal 
activity durham said 
reynolds carried a 357caliber pistol in a shoulder holster 
investigators said 
he was sitting on it when police arrived danley said he 
was unconscious at first and then he came to the officers said he 
was real quiet and never said a word 
there was no sign of a struggle but reynolds injured a shoulder 
when the police car ran off the state highway authorities said he 
was treated at regional medical center in memphis before his arrest 
a passerby who noticed the wrecked cruiser alerted police to the 
shootings 
were all stunned said ann smith city recorder of gates a 
town of 700 people about 60 miles north of memphis where nolen was 
elected to a twoyear term as mayor in june its tragic that 
anything like this could happen to two good friends of ours 
the sheriff said alcohol tests on reynolds were negative but 
results of drug tests were not yet available 
reynolds was convicted in 1945 of assault according to indiana 
police records 
in may 1975 he pleaded guilty to three counts of possession of 
a firearm by a felon those charges stem from his arrest in 
february 1975 when he was charged with attempting to obstruct 
justice in connection with a federal drug conspiracy trial at the 
time of that arrest reynolds was armed with a handgun and had two 
others nearby records show

the food and drug administration is concerned 
that two independent surveys found milk supplies in several areas 
contaminated with potentially harmful drugs but the government 
says it sees no public health threat 
the fda is testing retail milk supplies in 13 cities in response 
to the surveys by the wall street journal and the center for 
science in the public interest that found some samples were tainted 
with veterinary drugs 
the testing should be completed within two to three weeks and 
the results will be made public fda spokesman jeff nesbit said 
tuesday 
the fda said that although it is concerned that these 
unconfirmed findings may indicate violative drug residues in 
milk it sees no public health threat associated with animal 
drug residues in milk at the levels reported by the wall street 
journal 
but michael jacobson executive director of the center for 
science in the public interest said the general presence of sulfa 
drugs and antibiotics in milk samples is disturbing 
people should be angry that the government hasnt ensured the 
safety of the milk supply he said people should continue 
drinking milk while they write a letter to their legislators 
demanding action 
the journals survey reported friday found that of 50 retail 
samples collected in 10 major cities 38 percent were contaminated 
with antibiotics and sulfa drugs used to treat sick cattle the 
newspaper said the most troubling in that class of drugs is 
sulfamethazine a suspected carcinogen 
another survey last week by the center for science in the public 
interest conducted in conjunction with the journal tested 20 milk 
samples from store shelves in metropolitan washington and found 20 
percent were tainted 
nesbit noted the test both surveys used called charm ii can 
detect the presence of the class of drugs known as sulfonamides 
but that further testing is required to identify which sulfa drug 
is present 
neither survey did further testing to confirm the presence of 
sulfamethazine he said 
jacobson said this is just the tip of the iceberg because 
tests do not exist to detect many other drugs used by farmers he 
said the test used by most states for testing milk can detect 
penicillin but not other antibiotics 
the fda last year revised labeling for sulfamethazine to warn 
farmers and veterinarians against using it in lactating dairy cows 
because of recent studies finding that at high levels it can cause 
tumors in mice and rats 
in 1988 the fda tested retail milk supplies in 10 cities and 
found sulfamethazine in five of 49 samples at more than the 
allowable limit of 10 parts per billion 
in response the fda launched a nationwide education program to 
alert state and industry officials to the problem the fda also 
created a federal milktesting program in cooperation with the 
environmental protection agency which is in addition to state and 
industry testing programs 
in announcing the 13city milk survey the fda said dairy 
farmers must take responsibility for avoiding use of 
sulfamethazine the drug found which is not approved for dairy 
cows 
a lapse in which a farmer treats even a single cow can 
contaminate the milk when pooled of 70000 cows the fda said 
the 13 cities where milk is being tested are boston new york 
philadelphia atlanta miami chicago minneapolisst paul kansas 
city denver dallas los angeles san francisco and seattle

redoubt volcano blew its top again 
tuesday and scientists said the eruption appeared to be larger than 
those that occurred in december after the volcano emerged from a 
25year sleep 
a pilot reported seeing lightning and fireworks and a plume 
as high as 40000 feet after the eruption occurred about 6 pm 
said david stone a geophysicist with the alaska volcano 
observatory in fairbanks 
several pilots reported lava was flowing down the northwest 
flank of the mountain 115 miles southwest of anchorage said 
geologist robert mcgimsey of the alaska volcano observatory in 
anchorage 
mcgimsey said it was possible the flow was actually a mixture of 
ash and hot gas rather than lava he said scientists would have to 
wait until daylight to investigate 
the volcano spewed an extensive ash plume and it appeared 
the ash generally remained in the area of redoubt mcgimsey said 
light winds blowing toward anchorage were expected to shift 
slightly to the south overnight the national weather service said 
monitoring equipment on the volcano and elsewhere indicated a 
strong eruption stone said 
normally these things go on for some time a matter of hours 
or a day stone said 
the federal aviation administration advised pilots to 
continually evaluate operations to and from anchorage at least 
one plane a delta airlines flight scheduled from seattle to 
anchorage turned back after the pilot announced that the plume was 
headed for anchorage 
scientists have been monitoring the volcano around the clock 
after resting for a quarter of a century the peak erupted dec 13 
and spewed ash 33000 feet into the air the next day varying 
levels of seismic activity continued through the month 
during last months eruption christmas travelers and mail were 
delayed and anchorage air traffic slowed to a trickle after a klm 
royal dutch airlines boeing 747 flew through ash lost power to all 
four engines and fell more than two miles the plane made a safe 
emergency landing after the engines were restarted 
the seismicity is high enough that if the thing blew a plume 
we wouldnt be surprised mcgimsey said tuesday morning before 
the second eruption 
mcgimsey said there was an increase in shallow earthquakes in 
the volcano dome more temblors occurred seven to 10 kilometers 
beneath the 10197foot peak 115 miles southwest of anchorage he 
said 
and there were a couple of energetic pulses yesterday evening 
and early this morning mcgimsey said those were strong enough 
to have been felt on seismic instruments at mount spurr some 80 
miles to the northeast 
the habitation nearest the volcano the drift river oil storage 
facility 20 miles away had been evacuated before the eruption the 
alaska division of emergency services said about 11 people usually 
are assigned to the facility

rep robert garcia dny who faces up to 45 
years in prison when he is sentenced on his wedtech extortion 
conviction will resign sunday to give voters time to choose a 
successor a spokesman says 
clearly he wants to be done with this now so that they can 
prepare to have a special election garcia spokesman ron 
simoncini said tuesday it may not be the last possible moment 
but he views this as the time to do it 
garcias office issued a statement tuesday saying he will quit 
his house seat effective sunday the 56yearold congressman and 
his wife jane lee garcia 48 were convicted in october of 
extorting 178500 in cash loans and jewelry from the wedtech 
corp a nowdefunct defense contractor based in garcias south 
bronx district 
sentencing is set for jan 19 the garcias face up to 45 years 
each in prison and 750000 in fines in addition the congressman 
is under investigation by the house ethics committee although that 
probe will become moot once he quits 
simoncini said garcia was not seeking to time his resignation to 
influence the judge to be lenient 
he said he didnt know how that was going to affect the judge 
one way or the other simoncini said in an interview from new 
york 
garcia was vacationing with his family in florida and would not 
speak to reporters simoncini said 
in a statement garcia said it was with great sadness that 
he decided to resign 
the people of the bronx have always been the most important 
part of my life and representing them is the greatest honor i 
could ever know he said but i have always said that if i 
could not serve their best interests i would leave office 
vacating my seat now allows governor mario cuomo to call for 
a special election in time for the people of the bronx to choose a 
new member of congress to serve out this term garcia said 
in resigning garcia follows the example of fellow bronx 
democrat mario biaggi who gave up his seat in august 1988 after 
convictions in the wedtech and coastal dry dock cases biaggi is 
serving an eightyear prison term 
a handful of democrats have lined up to seek garcias seat but 
bronx democratic leaders have privately said state assemblyman jose 
serrano is the likely successor the district is overwhelmingly 
democratic and whoever gets the partys endorsement would be the 
clear frontrunner 
other possible candidates include pedro espada who ran against 
garcia in the 1988 primary and also lost races recently for new 
york city council and bronx borough president assemblywoman gloria 
davis and state sen olga mendez all are democrats 
garcia the only mainlandborn puerto rican ever elected to 
congress won his seat in 1978 in a special election after rep 
herman badillo resigned to become a deputy new york city mayor 
in congress garcia gained a reputation as an articulate and 
enthusiastic legislator but his bestknown piece of legislation 
a bill to create federal taxexempt enterprise zones to attract 
business to inner cities has never passed despite the 
cosponsorship of thenrep jack kemp rny 
nevertheless the concept of giving tax breaks to developers of 
decaying neighborhoods has been adopted in some states and kemp 
now secretary of housing and urban development continues to push 
for federal legislation 
garcia was chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus from 
1978 to 1982 and chairman of the post office and civil service 
subcommittee responsible for oversight of the census where he 
sought adjustments for undercounting 
the son of a pentecostal minister garcia grew up in the bronx 
went to public schools there and served in the army infantry in 
korea he later attended city college and new york community 
college but did not graduate he worked for eight years as a 
computer programmer before running for the new york state assembly 
where he served two terms

two codefendants of gen manuel noriega appeared 
in court tuesday to answer drug charges but both of their 
attorneys challenged the federal governments right to extradite 
them from panama 
daniel miranda 36 gave only his name and age through an 
interpreter to a federal magistrate his attorney michael okane 
of fort lauderdale then said he would remain mute throughout the 
proceeding 
this is a violation of the panama canal treaty the seasoned 
criminal attorney said it says that if there are any criminal 
acts the defendant would be turned over to panamanian authorities 
and not surrendered to the united states 
in another courtroom luis del cid a man prosecutors have 
referred to as noriegas right hand man had his pretrial 
detention hearing continued until jan 16 so his attorneys could 
bring in witnesses from panama 
as much as american citizens might like to see justice done to 
criminals all over the world the united states is not an 
international police force del cids lawyer samuel burstyn 
said outside the courtroom the united states just cant go out 
and invade other countries and arrest whomever it wants 
del cid has been held in miami since he was captured by us 
special forces troops in panamas northern cheriqui province on 
christmas eve and flown to florida the next day 
both men were named in the 12count indictment handed up 
february 1988 in miami that also accuses noriega medellin cartel 
leader pablo escobar and 11 others of running drugs and using 
panama as a safe haven 
us prosecutors say noriega accepted millions of dollars in 
bribes in exchange for allowing the cartel to launder money and 
process and ship drugs through panama to the united states 
miranda was arrested by us military personnel and drug 
enforcement administration agents during a 6 am raid on his 
panama city apartment on sunday and escorted to miami the next 
day on tuesday he wore a headset and occasionally nodded his head 
as he listened to the hearing in spanish 
he is accused of flying an airplane from fort lauderdale to 
panama in may 1983 with 800000 of drug money on board if 
convicted miranda faces up to five years in prison and 10000 in 
fines 
in contrast noriega would face up to 145 years in prison and 
more than 1 million in fines if brought to miami and convicted on 
all drug trafficking charges 
us magistrate peter palermo entered a plea of not guilty for 
miranda and ordered him held until a pretrial detention hearing 
friday after us attorney dexter lehtinen personally requested 
that miranda be held without bond 
mirandas attorney objected in vain to the governments request 
there is no reason for that okane said there are many 
people accused of crimes ten times worse and they get bond 
outside the court okane said the government violated a us 
law that forbids the military from making arrests in foreign 
countries for criminal violations and that miranda should not have 
been turned over to the dea 
meanwhile tuesday del cids attorneys burstyn and assistant 
federal public defender kenneth swartz said they needed more time 
to bring members of the defendants family and panamanian military 
figures to the hearing 
we want to put on witnesses who would contradict what the 
government has proffered burstyn told us district judge 
william hoeveler 
the attorneys also objected to the way del cid was brought to 
the united states 
del cid 46 was arrested by dea agents on christmas day in 
panama after surrendering to us forces the indictment said he 
acted as a liaison and money courier between drug traffickers and 
noriega 
the government has violated the geneva convention burstyn 
said once he surrendered in panama he can not be transferred to 
this country 
del cid a commander in the panamanian defense forces faces 
racketeering drug smuggling and moneylaundering charges which 
carry a maximum penalty of 70 years in prison and 550000 in fines 
outside the courtroom burstyn and swartz said they expect to 
bring five witnesses from panama and bring in testimony obtained 
through polygraph tests 
two other minor defendants brian alden davidow and william 
saldarriaga are also awaiting trial in miami davidow is an 
alleged cocaine distributor in miami and saldarriaga is an alleged 
colombian cocaine trafficker 
the other eleven men named in the indictment are still at large 
noriega remained at the vatican embassy in panama city tuesday 
after seeking asylum there on dec 24 
noriega has also been indicted by a federal grand jury in tampa 
on charges of taking a 54 million bribe from the colombian drug 
cartel but the justice department has said if noriega is brought 
to the united states he would first be tried by miami prosecutors 
who have a stronger case against him

the government is effectively slapping for 
sale signs on 30123 real estate properties owned by bankrupt 
savings and loan associations in 35 states 
the resolution trust corp created aug 9 by sampl bailout 
legislation on tuesday issued a fourvolume 3000page 10pound 
inventory of what its offering the vast majority of the parcels 
are residential 26813 and 11918 of those are singlefamily 
homes 
its a diverse list with properties ranging from a dairy queen 
in woodland park colo to a golf course on south padre island 
texas the government has nursing homes theaters condos marinas 
churches and singlefamily homes all available for a price 
and the government wants to sell the sooner it gets rid of the 
properties the sooner it has additional cash to dispose of more 
bankrupt thrift institutions 
in a strategic plan scheduled for release today an 
administration oversight board led by treasury secretary nicholas 
f brady urges the rtc to sell the real estate even before it sells 
the sampls that own the property according to a copy obtained 
earlier by the associated press 
maine vermont west virginia and north and south dakota are the 
only states without property listed but as expected most of the 
properties 15750 are in texas where the rtc has seized 90 
bankrupt sampls more than half of the singlefamily homes 6259 
are in texas 
the hefty rtc volumes are actually just a shadow of whats to 
come the list will be updated every six months 
the first version includes properties of the 283 sampls seized by 
sept 30 as of dec 31 the agency had taken over 318 institutions 
and sampl regulators were expected to turn over more than 200 others 
this year 
public interest in the properties has been enormous the rtc 
says it received more than 22000 written inquiries before it 
stopped counting 
the list is split into four sections singlefamily homes 
multifamily residential commercial and land the residential 
sections are available for 15 each and the land and commercial 
sections for 10 each the whole package costs 50 and can be 
ordered by calling 18004310600 
the lists also are being distributed to 1400 libraries across 
the country callers can get the name of the nearest library by 
calling the 800 number 
the amount of information offered is far sketchier than a 
typical real estate advertisement an office listing may include 
only the propertys address acreage and whether the building is 
more or less than 100000 square feet some are listed with real 
estate agents some arent 
a typical singlefamily home listing includes more address 
square footage type of construction total rooms number of 
bedrooms and baths condition asking price and real estate agent

former president reagans attorneys are trying 
to delay defense attempts to subpoena him as a witness at the 
irancontra trial of exnational security adviser john m 
poindexter 
reagans lawyers called poindexters attempt to subpoena the 
former president an unprecedented action that raises substantial 
constitutional questions 
in court papers filed tuesday they urged us district judge 
harold greene to postpone any decision on the subpoena until 
prosecutors have rested their case in the trial set to begin feb 
20 
the court filing also indicated that reagan might invoke 
executive privilege and refuse to answer questions about foreign 
affairs or national security if he were forced to take the witness 
stand at poindexters trial 
requiring a former president to testify about the irancontra 
affair might undermine relations with foreign countries and hurt 
national security the lawyers said 
relations and discussions with foreign governments are 
apparently at the heart of many of the issues presented in the 
case the filing said answers required by the unforeseeable 
questions of counsel might deal with the united states contacts 
with foreign governments and other entities abroad 
the spectacle of a former president being subjected to 
preemptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the 
way they deal with the presidents now and in the future reagans 
lawyers said 
reagan would have a difficult if not impossible job of 
protecting government secrets when asked about sensitive matters 
while he is on the witness stand the lawyers noted 
such determinations cannot be made instantaneously and without 
the participation of the incumbent president reagans lawyers 
said 
the justice department in a separate filing supported reagans 
move to postpone any decision on the subpoena and expressed similar 
concerns about forcing a former president to testify about the 
conduct of his office 
the precedent of the compelled testimony of a recent former 
president necessarily will have a telling impact on the present and 
future operation of the presidency the justice department said 
both the president and his advisers will be substantially 
inhibited if they know that this same president can later be 
compelled to reveal the entire content of their conversations 
reagans lawyers said a decision to enforce the subpoena should 
be made only after the prosecution rests its case because 
poindexters need for the former presidents testimony may be 
very different at that point in the trial 
evidence that he now believes to be central may prove to be 
unnecessary reagans lawyers said 
they noted a similar procedure was followed in last years 
irancontra trial of former white house aide oliver north who was 
convicted of trying to cover up his involvement in the diversion of 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
the judge in norths case waited until prosecutors had completed 
their case before denying the former national security council 
aides request to subpoena reagan 
poindexter is accused of lying to congress and obstructing 
various congressional inquiries about the irancontra affair 
defense filings in the case indicate poindexter may try to 
portray reagan as a more active and informed participant in the 
irancontra affair than the president poindexter described in his 
1987 congressional testimony 
as an alternative to requiring reagans testimony attorneys for 
the former president suggested he be allowed to respond in writing 
to questions or testify during a videotaped deposition the 
videotape would then be played to jurors

alligator owner and tavern proprietor james 
schebler says mascot crosby is a real pussycat but the city 
council refused to allow the bar to display the lounge lizard 
there are a lot of dogs in town that are not maintained 
properly and are more of a danger than crosby if you maintain an 
animal properly the danger is at a minimum said schebler who 
bought crosbys cove in coggon four months ago and named it after 
his pet alligator 
schebler wanted to keep the alligator now 2 feet long in the 
eastern iowa bar to attract customers 
but the council tuesday rejected scheblers request that the 
communitys dangerous pets ordinance be amended to allow alligators 
to be kept in the city as long as they are in a locked container 
mayor james pflughaupt jr told schebler that before he could 
display the alligator in his bar he would have to win a change in 
a state law that bars animals in establishments that sell food or 
drink 
meanwhile other problems surfaced for the reptile during the 
council meeting it was disclosed that crosby is living in cedar 
rapids which also has a dangerous animal ordinance that bans 
alligators within city limits

a presidential commission is calling for more 
flexible marketoriented farm policies that would leave it up to 
farmers to decide what crops to plant and how much but still 
provide a safety net for hard times 
the strength of us agriculture depends on its ability to 
compete in the domestic and international marketplace says the 
report released tuesday by the national commission on agriculture 
and rural development policy 
recommendations ranging from more research to an end to 
emergency disaster aid are contained in the report future 
directions in agricultural policy produced by the 15member 
commission established by the 1985 farm act 
leading the list is a call for balancing the federal budget 
words that in the farm community are guaranteed to suggest cuts in 
the payment programs that lifted american agriculture out of the 
economic doldrums of the mid1980s but at the cost of record 
spending 
federal outlays for farm programs reached a record 258 billion 
in fiscal 1986 but within two years fell to 125 billion all the 
same they remain several times what they were a decade ago 
reducing the federal deficit to lower interest rates would 
improve export competitiveness and reduce production costs said 
the commission 
the commission said the nation needs a longrange plan for farm 
policy it said the blueprint should be consistent with any 
agricultural agreement that emerges from current uruguay round 
trade negotiations 
if no such agreement emerges it said longrange planning is 
still needed and should include an orderly transition away from 
policies that make government programs a key factor in farmers 
decisions on what to plant and how much to produce 
farm lawmakers will take a fresh look at these programs as they 
prepare to fashion a replacement for the soontoexpire 1985 act 
deficit cutters complain that major programs actually give the 
lions share of the benefits not to those who need the money but to 
those financially and technologically geared up to bring in bumper 
crops 
that means bulging bins which lowers prices and makes 
government payments even more costly say the critics 
congress already has taken some tentative steps away from the 
link between payments from production the commissions 
recommendations give a boost to that concept and would represent a 
sharp departure from existing major programs 
the principal purpose of farm programs should be to stabilize 
incomes to provide a safety net in times of low prices or 
yields the report said 
the commission said the structure of farm programs has not kept 
pace with economic social and technological changes that have 
swept rural america 
agriculture is now primarily a commercial activity managed by 
highly skilled individuals who like other entrepreneurs plan 
manage their resources in response to market opportunities take 
risks and accept the consequences both positive and negative 
the report said 
the report said government often inadvertently curtails 
economic growth opportunities while at the same time stimulating 
inefficient activities 
the economic vitality of many areas of production agriculture 
would improve with a significant reduction in government 
intervention it said 
to get into farm programs it said producers must often 
restrict the acreage they plant since the incentives differ by 
crop government programs can have a significant effect on the mix 
of crops produced and the amount the report said the result 
may be inconsistent with the needs of domestic and foreign 
consumers 
it said federal programs have indirectly encouraged farmers to 
use greater amounts of pesticides and chemical fertilizers the 
environmental consequences of such programs are a growing concern 
farm programs for major crops are frequently not a very good 
remedy for financial problems the report said it said less than 
10 percent of payments in 1988 went to farms considered 
financially vulnerable while about 60 percent went to farms 
with a favorable financial condition based on incomes and 
debttoasset ratios 
about half of american agriculture gets no federal support such 
producers develop sophisticated means to deal with price and 
yield risks and promote and market their crops it said these 
areas of agriculture are often the most competitive both 
domestically and internationally 
the report also said program costs are inflated because 
government purchase prices for butter cheese and nonfat dry milk 
do not reflect consumer demand it said the current system imposes 
artificial barriers on the movement of milk supplies among the 
regions of the country 
it said acreage reduction and production control programs have 
cut employment and investment in farming and related industries

union officials say labor secretary elizabeth 
dole should use the measures that helped achieve tentative 
settlement of a lengthy coal strike to bring striking machinists 
together with eastern airlines 
were happy that our brothers and sisters have a tentative 
agreement in the coal strike but as far as eastern receiving 
help from liz dole we havent seen or heard from her since the day 
of the strike machinists spokesman james conley said tuesday 
but labor department spokeswoman johanna schneider said 
appointment of a special federal supermediator the move that 
jumpstarted the coal talks is unlikely in the 10month airline 
strike 
theyre entirely different situations said schneider 
it would not have been appropriate for mrs dole to take the 
same step in the eastern strike because president bush decided 
against naming an emergency mediation board 
in addition schneider said airline contract disputes fall under 
the railway labor act and are governed by different mediation 
guidelines than those for other industries 
organized labor officials praised mrs doles efforts to help 
break the coal stalemate but expressed skepticism about any 
longterm change in the governments hands off approach to 
labor disputes 
you can never take one incident and call it a trend said 
aflcio spokeswoman lorrie mchugh bush vetoed legislation to 
create a special panel to investigate the strike against eastern 
airlines she and others noted 
both sides in the coal dispute said mrs doles appointment of 
special mediator wj usery and organizing facetoface talks 
between pittston co chairman paul douglas and united mine workers 
president richard trumka was instrumental in achieving a tentative 
settlement new years day 
the agreement which would end a 9monthold strike is subject 
to ratification by the companys 1700 striking workers in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky 
union officials also said they appreciated an october visit mrs 
dole made to a picket line at a remote virginia coal field as well 
as new years day phone calls she placed to three striking miners 
she said she wanted to make 1990 a happier new year for me and 
my family and she wanted me to tell the other miners goose bumps 
popped up said fred wallace one of the umw workers contacted by 
mrs dole wallace a miner for 20 years was one of the strikers 
who met with mrs dole in october when she visited a picket line in 
rural russell county va 
under mrs dole the bush administration has tried to mend 
relations with organized labor after eight years of hostility under 
president reagan 
schneider said union officials are correct to reserve judgment 
about future labor disputes this is not necessarily setting a 
precedent in the labor secretary getting involved every labor 
dispute is different she said 
she said mrs dole initiated the federal move to enter the 
bitter strike and was not trying to score political points for the 
bush administration 
mrs dole contacted the white house the bush administration 
did not say elizabeth you go down to the coal fields it was 
part and parcel mrs doles idea schneider said 
one union official tempered his praise for mrs dole by 
suggesting the bush administration saw the coal strike as a chance 
to make points on several fronts 
the umw official speaking on condition of anonymity noted the 
strike captured wide attention when an official of polands 
solidarity union and other foreign labor leaders visited the coal 
fields in october and criticized the treatment of striking miners 
in addition the official said pittston is a chief supplier of 
coal to japan and the administration wants to ensure that japans 
supplies remain steady the settlement also provides an opportunity 
for the administration to advance ideas in health care a key issue 
in the coal dispute 
the administrations intervention didnt fall out of the sky 
government officials make policy and move on issues to respond to 
public pressure not necessarily out of the goodness of their 
hearts the official said 
even so umw spokesman john duray said mrs doles intervention 
was a welcome and significant departure from what the labor 
departments done for the last 10 years 
under mrs dole the agency saw itself as an agency that could 
help resolve a dispute rather than an agency that should take a 
handsoff attitude duray said

sen carl levin dmich says us troop 
strength in western europe can be cut by a third 
levin said tuesday that the first phase of negotiations with the 
soviet union aimed at cutting the 300000 us troops in western 
europe to 275000 should be followed immediately with a second 
round of negotiations to reduce force levels to about 200000 
the chairman of the senate armed forces subcommittee on 
conventional forces and alliance defense commented after returning 
from a visit to czechoslovakia and east and west berlin 
he said he was told by east german defense minister theodore 
hoffman that his countrys 1990 defense budget will be cut by about 
20 percent significantly deeper than the 10 percent reduction 
already announced 
a significant reduction in us force levels in western europe 
can now be made safely because the forces of the warsaw pact can no 
longer be relied on to join the soviet union in a cohesive attack 
on the west levin said 
levin said reductions in us forces in europe should be coupled 
with large cuts in the us defense budget with the savings applied 
to waging the war on drugs reducing the budget deficit improving 
education cleaning up the environment and aiding the newly 
emerging noncommunist governments in eastern europe

the former land reform secretary says 
intrigue follows sex as the second most popular sport in the 
philippines and she wants to be remembered for shapely legs and not 
alleged links to coup plotters 
miriam defensor santiago was replaced sunday as secretary of the 
department of agrarian reform during a major cabinet shakeup 
her name reportedly appeared on a list of possible members of a 
junta that would have been installed had military mutineers toppled 
president corazon aquino last month 
i appeal to you not to include my name in your junta list 
again because it gets me into trouble mrs santiago told 
reporters tuesday instead you may include me in the list of 
filipinas with the most shapely legs 
mrs santiago also complained that her tenure in the agrarian 
reform department was undermined by political intrigue in the 
aquino administration 
in this country intrigue is the second most popular indoor 
sport second only to sex she said 
mrs santiagos departure from government removes one of the 
most colorful figures in the aquino administration 
as immigration commissioner mrs santiago once publicly called 
a congressional critic a fungusface and suggested he stick his 
finger in an electrical socket she then challenged the congressman 
to a fistfight an offer he never accepted 
later she threatened to chop into a thousand pieces corrupt 
employees and throw them to the sharks in manila bay however i 
doubt if the sharks would eat you out of a sense of professional 
courtesy she added 
mrs santiago a former judge was named agrarian reform 
secretary last july after the immigration post

amnesty international said today that the israeli 
government appears to have encouraged the killings of unarmed 
palestinians in its effort to crush the uprising in the occupied 
lands 
the worldwide human rights organization said the guidelines for 
the use of firearms by israeli troops permit unjustifiable killings 
of palestinians and claimed abuses are not adequately investigated 
we are concerned that taken together these factors appear to 
add up to more than just tolerance of serious abuses and amount to 
real encouragement of them amnesty said in its january 
newsletter 
in jerusalem foreign ministry spokesman yossi amihud said 
tuesday ahead of the newsletters official release that the report 
was an outrageous accusation it is total nonsense and absolutely 
baseless 
amnesty said unarmed palestinians have been fatally shot by 
israeli forces almost daily since the palestinian uprising began in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip in december 1987 
it said the army the paramilitary border police and other law 
enforcement agencies in the occupied territories have tried to stop 
the disturbances by shooting at demonstrators using tear gas and 
severely beating detainees 
their use of force has often been excessive and 
indiscriminate amnesty said it said it has raised all the cases 
in its report with israeli authorities but is not aware of any 
detailed findings of any investigation being made public 
israeli authorities say they investigate every fatal shooting 
amnesty said that in some cases evidence was sought from 
palestinian witnesses and the scene of the killing was inspected 
but that investigations appear to rely mainly on evidence from 
soldiers or police involved 
it said official investigations generally take a long time 
their findings are not automatically made public and those found 
guilty of abuses are not always adequately punished 
amnesty said that since the beginning of the uprising only four 
soldiers are reported to have been convicted of manslaughter 
it called for a review of the firearms guidelines and said 
israels highest authorities must make clear to all law enforcement 
officials that abuses will not be tolerated and all those 
responsible will be prosecuted 
the israeli embassy in london said in response that 61 soldiers 
have been convicted and 46 sentenced to various terms of 
imprisonment 
more than 640 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the uprising and another 166 have been killed by 
fellow arabs who suspected them of collaborating with israel 
fortythree israelis have died 
more than 560 of the palestinians were fatally shot by israelis 
with 130 victims under age 16 35 under 12 and some as young as 3 
amnesty said 
most were killed by ordinary bullets although by the end of 
september 117 had been killed by plastic bullets and others by 
rubber bullets or rubbercoated metal pellets it said 
at least 15 reportedly died after beatings by israeli forces and 
70 or more died in tear gasrelated incidents about half after 
canisters were thrown into confined spaces it said 
amnesty said the scope of the firearms guidelines had been 
progressively extended during the uprising and live ammunition may 
now be used against suspects including anyone wearing a mask 
israeli regulations require soldiers to shout an order to halt 
then fire into the air and finally aim at the suspects legs 
amnesty said it said it was not clear how serious an offense must 
be to permit the use of firearms and alleged the guidelines are 
often disregarded by israeli forces 
although most killings appear to have occurred during 
demonstrations or riots in an alarmingly high number of 
instances those shot do not appear to have been involved in any 
lifethreatening or even violent activities amnesty said 
it also charged that after some shootings israeli forces 
withheld or hampered emergency medical care

band of castaways on televisions gilligans island has died 
of cancer

hospitalized for cancer said bonnie churchill a spokeswoman for 
hales family she said he had been hospitalized about a month 
after being diagnosed with the disease a year ago 
the family said hale was 68 but reference books listed his age 
as 71 
bob denver who played gilligan on the series said hale reveled 
in his worldwide fame as the skipper and never tired of playing 
the role in public

personal appearances with hale as recently as six months ago he 
wore his skippers hat all the time 
the actor was to be cremated and his ashes scattered at sea by 
the neptune society on saturday 
a native of los angeles hale appeared in 65 movies but became 
a fixture on afternoon television thanks to the widely successful 
syndication of gilligans island the show ran in prime time 
from 1964 to 1967 before going into syndication 
hale played a charter boat skipper whose craft the minnow was 
lost at sea and wrecked on an uncharted south pacific island the 
show followed the misadventures of the passengers 
he was a great guy and a great physical comic denver said 
he was so strong that i could run across the stage and he could 
catch me like a feather thats what made our comedy so great 
the success of gilligans island reruns led to hales 
appearance in a 1978 reunion of the cast members the twopart 
special had the islanders finally rescued only to be shipwrecked 
again while on a reunion cruise two more sequel specials aired in 
1979 and 1981 
hale came from a show business family his father was a matinee 
idol in silent films and his mother was an actress 
the younger hale bore a strong resemblance to his father who 
was often sidekick to errol flynn in such classics as the sea 
hawk and robin hood after the advent of talking films 
hale was survived by his wife of 25 years naomi their four 
children and his sister karen hale wookey

united mine workers waiting for details of 
a tentative agreement to end a ninemonth strike were saying 
little about the walkouts impact on their lives but a crisis 
center head said it has torn them up 
some of them have been putting up a brave front while their 
hearts were breaking and their pocketbooks were empty gaye 
martin said tuesday its been devastating for some of them 
martin who runs the only crisis center in virginia coal 
country said many of the strikers dont want pittston coal group 
to know the hardships caused by the strike 
if i wasnt bound by confidentiality i could tell you stories 
that would break your heart and bring tears to your eyes she 
said in a telephone interview from the crisis center in dickenson 
county 
striking miners stayed on picket lines tuesday the contents of 
the settlement were not being disclosed as umw officials scrambled 
to get printed copies of the pact 
theres a lot of concerns and questions being asked about the 
contents of the contract said charles dixon a umw international 
executive board member from district 30 based in pikeville ky 
there are secrets and then there are secrets things are real 
hushhush on the contents of the pittston agreement 
the umw and pittston must sell their proposed settlement to two 
judges a federal agency and trustees of a health and retirement 
fund before striking miners vote union officials say a vote isnt 
expected at least until next week 
its going to be an interesting process umw spokesman john 
duray said tuesday night 
the tentative agreement was announced monday at a news 
conference held by labor secretary elizabeth dole in washington 
dc 
duray said because the settlement came over a holiday it has 
slowed procedures such as getting the contract printed 
the sometimesviolent strike began april 5 and affected 1700 
pittston miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky at one 
point more than 46000 miners in nearly a dozen states staged a 
wildcat sympathy strike 
a key issue was pittstons attempt to end its contributions to 
the umws industrywide retirement fund pittston said it couldnt 
afford to continue payments to the fund which covers 130000 
pensioners who retired between 1947 and 1976 
the roanoke times amp worldnews reported today that pittston 
compromised on its health care stance the company had wanted 
insurance covering 80 percent of costs with workers paying the rest 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified national expert on the coal 
industry that the new agreement calls for the companys insurance 
plan to pay the cost of health care for working miners and those 
who retired after 1975 but deductibles will be increased the 
newspaper said 
umw officials will meet with the funds trustees before the 
agreement is voted on by striking miners duray said the union and 
pittston also want to resolve more than 64 million in fines levied 
by state and federal courts in virginia courts against the union 
during the strike no hearings had been scheduled tuesday 
daniel roling a senior mining analyst with merrill lynch 
capital markets in new york called the agreement a winwin 
situation in that the union didnt give up any major points and 
they were able to maintain medical benefits for retired workers 
miners were tightlipped and proud 
ocie murray a striking miner and pastor of the russell fork 
baptist baptist church in council said the majority of miners 
just had to tighten their belts 
nancy bryant a striking miner said weve been getting by 
its all right 
martin the crisis center head had a different view she said 
she knows of six miners who lost homes and several who lost cars 
because they couldnt meet monthly payments she said marriages 
also were lost 
some of them have been under so much pressure their homes have 
broken up she said

airline flights were canceled and 
residents marveled at a spectacular light show as redoubt volcano 
shot ash as high as 40000 feet in its biggest eruption since 
waking from a 25year sleep 
the alaska volcano observatory said the eruption at 550 pm 
tuesday was redoubts biggest since seismic activity began dec 13 
pilots reported a plume as high as 40000 feet and said lava 
appeared to be flowing down the volcanos northwest flank 115 miles 
southwest of anchorage observatory scientists said 
a radio station near kenai across cook inlet from the volcano 
was swamped with calls from people who saw lights in the sky 
weve had listeners on the air reporting what looked like 
heated falling stones said john davis of station ksrm he said 
people parked their cars near inlet beaches to watch the display 
geologist robert mcgimsey of the observatory in anchorage said 
it was possible the reported lava flow was a mixture of ash and hot 
gas he said scientists would have to wait until daylight to 
investigate 
the volcano spewed an extensive ash plume mcgimsey said 
another geologist at the observatory don richter said late 
tuesday night that it appeared most of the ash had settled before 
reaching populated areas 
richter said a number of strong but less severe seismic 
events occurred at about 8 pm 
it looks like it may keep up this level of explosive 
activity today he said 
the federal aviation administration advised pilots to 
continually evaluate operations to and from anchorage a number 
of flights scheduled for tuesday night and this morning were 
canceled and some night flights were diverted to other airports 
scientists have been monitoring the volcano around the clock 
the peak erupted three weeks ago and spewed ash 33000 feet into 
the air the next day varying levels of seismic activity continued 
through the month 
last month christmas travelers and mail were delayed and 
anchorage air traffic slowed to a trickle after a klm royal dutch 
airlines boeing 747 flew through ash lost power to all four 
engines and fell more than two miles the plane made a safe 
emergency landing after the engines were restarted 
the habitation nearest the volcano the drift river oil storage 
facility 20 miles away was evacuated tuesday when scientists 
issued warnings about the upcoming eruption the alaska division of 
emergency services said about 11 people usually are assigned to 
the facility 
richter said the lights observed by people on the kenai 
peninsula are common after eruptions 
theres been a lot of electrical discharging in that eruption 
column a large electrical buildup he said 
mark norgren who lives on a bluff about seven miles north of 
kenai said he saw three or four occasions of bolt lightning 
during a 45minute period soon after the eruption 
its like a flash that radiates throught the cloud he said 
when it comes through the cloud it just illuminates the whole 
sky

as it attempted to hold down a 
devastating inflationary spiral the 6monthold government of 
president carlos menem ordered banks and foreign exchange houses to 
remain closed today 
the bank holiday that began tuesday was argentinas sixth in 
less than one month ordered by the government as it tries to 
stabilize the countrys currency the austral 
the last days of 1989 saw panicbuying and hoarding by shoppers 
the withholding of supplies by distributers and restricted sales by 
businesses particularly pharmacies gas stations and neighborhood 
food stores 
argentines lacking confidence in their economy bought so many 
dollars last month that the austral lost nearly 50 percent of its 
value 
in a bid to curtail dollarbuying and bring down interest rates 
that have topped 600 percent a month the government on monday 
moved to restrict the amount of australs in circulation 
raul cuello secretary of public revenue said he was 
absolutely certain that when banks and exchange houses reopen 
the dollar will trade below last weeks levels 
however he told the government news agency telam we are 
immersed in a tremendous crisis that requires much effort 
imagination and constant adjusting 
the devaluation of the austral has fueled interest rates as 
banks struggle to retain funds that investors wanted to convert to 
the safer us dollar it also has ignited price hikes of 100 
percent in most goods and commodities 
devaluations that totaled 99 percent in 1989 pulverized 
savings in australs economy minister antonio gonzalez said monday 
while sharply reducing the value of government revenues and 
touching off demands for higher wages 
the economy was chaotic even before menem took office and 
argentines fear shortages of food and medicine high prices and 
shrunken real wages all of which could touch off the kind of 
social unrest that occurred in may 
foot riots broke out across the country in may and june with 
looting widespread by people made desperate by the shrinking value 
of their wages 
comparing the current economic dilemma with that of the months 
before a 1976 military coup antonio cafiero president of the 
ruling peronist party said this is much worse than that the 
military remained in power until the 1983 election of raul 
alfonsin menems predecessor 
while there are few signs of military unrest cafiero governor 
of buenos aires province said all of us governors are worried 
about possible reoccurrences of food riots 
the government has embarked on four stabilization plans in six 
months and says it plans to press with plans to sell moneylosing 
state companies narrow the budget deficit reform the tax code and 
deregulate the economy 
however analysts said the economic convulsions indicate a lack 
of public confidence in menems ability to carry out such a program 
in the face of opposition by unions fighting to protect jobs and 
benefits and by businesses that sell to the state 
menem has had three economy ministers and three central bank 
presidents since he took office 
on tuesday longtime adviser eduardo curia resigned as secretary 
of economic matters curia endorsed the socalled dollarization 
of the economy that menem at one point reportedly approved but 
finally rejected last weekend 
that decision would have allowed the us dollar to be legally 
used to set wages prices bond values apartment rents and other 
variables in an economy beset in 1989 by inflation topping 5000 
percent

the publisher of the jerusalem post has 
accepted the resignations of 20 journalists who said they were 
leaving because the newspapers editorial independence had been 
compromised 
publisher yehuda levy on tuesday sent letters to the journalists 
ordering them to clear their desks and three more members of the 
editorial staff resigned later in the day 
those whose resignations were accepted included managing editor 
david landau and eight other senior editors and reporters 
the journalists accuse levy a former israeli army colonel with 
no previous experience in journalism of damaging the integrity of 
israels only englishlanguage daily 
the newspapers top editor erwin frankel resigned last week 
saying levy had undermined his editorial authority 
in their letters of resignation to levy and canadian owner david 
radler on monday the other journalists said they had no choice but 
to leave because of an everincreasing erosion of editorial 
independence 
according to landau the resignations were triggered by levys 
removal of an editorial from the posts weekly international 
edition 
the nov 30 editorial defended the posts right to criticize the 
government after prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing 
likud party accused it of harming israels reputation abroad 
that editorial was in fact the touchstone of whether we have a 
really editorially independent newspaper the issue was the most 
basic issue of journalistic integrity said landau 42 who began 
working at the post in 1970 
levy denied accusations that he is moving the historically 
liberal newspaper in a conservative direction 
i want to say that all the labels they are trying to apply to 
me are labels that stick well in the media but theres nothing to 
them levy said in an interview on israel radio 
the dispute is not over what they are claiming its about but 
over proper management of this workplace he said 
levy said about 80 permanent journalists still work for the 
newspaper 
joanna yehiel who quit her job as magazine and features editor 
estimated that only about 30 fulltime journalists remain 
levy was appointed president and publisher in july by radler 
chairman of the board of hollinger inc a canadian newspaper 
group hollinger inc bought a controlling interest in the post in 
april 
the papers editorial staff filed notice of a labor dispute 
thursday and demanded levys removal the notice will allow them to 
take action including a strike or work slowdown after a twoweek 
waiting period 
the wave of resignations began nov 30 with the departure of the 
head editor ari rath who had persistent disagreements with levy

new york state high school students can 
throw away their slide rules 
starting next year students taking regents math exams will be 
able to use calculators to check their addition subtraction 
multiplication and division said fred paul head of the state 
education departments mathematics bureau 
what a nice forwardlooking move said shirley frye 
president of the national council of teachers of mathematics 
students have long been permitted to use slide rules to help 
them in regents exams which are designed for collegebound 
students 
most of the regents math test involves problemsolving in areas 
like algebra geometry and trigonometry students will still be 
required to show the work involved in reaching a conclusion with 
the calculators just helping them check the basic computations 
paul said 
the calculators still will not be allowed for basic math 
proficiency tests at all grade levels he said and students will 
only be permitted to bring in the simple fourfunction calculators 
that add subtract multiply and divide he said 
calculators are part of everyday technology frye said 
what we really want to know is whether students can solve 
problems computation is just a small part of mathematics 
the head of the math teachers group said theres a certain 
segment of society that wants students today to suffer with the 
same calculations they had to go through but its impractical she 
said 
you dont see any adults in real life doing 30 longdivision 
problems frye said if a person doing income tax wasnt using 
the modern technology you probably wouldnt go to them 
since new york and california which is developing plans to 
include calculators in teaching curriculum are both leaders in 
education policy frye said she expected other states to follow in 
allowing calculators on tests 
calculators will first be allowed on the june 1991 math regents 
exams paul said

president samuel k doe has fired his 
internal affairs minister and a senior local official for 
mishandling reports of an impending rebel invasion 
a government statement tuesday said col edward sackor and 
stephen daniels superintendent of nimba county had misled the 
administration about a plot to destabilize does regime 
the statement said sackor and daniels recommended in october the 
dismissal and detention of a local chief jerry gonyon after he 
reported unusual activities in nimba county where the rebels first 
struck 
nimba county which is now under a dusk to dawn curfew borders 
ivory coast liberias eastern neighbor the government says rebels 
entered the country from the ivory coast on dec 24 
it was unclear whether sackors dismissal was also related to 
official reports that some of the alleged invaders in custody had 
escaped 
on sunday doe announced that two groups of insurgents had 
entered the country the west african nations leader said one 
group killed a police sergeant at the border town of butuo in nimba 
county before government soldiers arrested the situation 
doe said the other group reached the capital monrovia but 
abandoned their arms in the central market and surrendered he said 
they confessed to planning to destabilize the government 
justice minister jenkins scott said tuesday that the invaders 
numbered 96 had been trained in libya and burkina faso and entered 
liberia from the ivory coast 
doe a former master sergeant in the liberian army came to 
power in a bloody coup in april 1980 in which president william 
tolbert a descendant of freed american slaves and most of his 
political allies were killed 
doe himself has since withstood several alleged plots and claims 
the ivory coast harbors opponents of his regime the ivory coast

test wells drilled at the fernald uranium 
processing plant show a new source of uranium contamination in a 
nearby aquifer 
two wells drilled at the federally owned plants southwest 
corner show 200 to 800 parts per billion of uranium about 70 feet 
underground in the great miami aquifer the cincinnati enquirer 
reported today the us environmental protection agencys proposed 
uranium standard for drinking water is 30 parts per billion 
nobody claimed we had all the answers yet said graham 
mitchell fernald team leader for the ohio environmental protection 
agency the plants doing this investigation just so we can find 
these things but the numbers are raising concern and it does 
point toward additional sources of contamination 
a federal court meanwhile dismissed the us department of 
energys appeal of the 78 million settlement reached in a lawsuit 
filed by neighbors of the fernald plant 
clerk leonard green of the 6th us circuit court of appeals on 
tuesday granted the departments request to drop the appeal 
greens order lets the energy department allocate settlement money 
which would pay for medical monitoring of people living near the 
plant 
mitchell said plant officials have known about a plume of 
underground radiation creeping toward the ohio river about 18 
miles southeast of the plant but he said the new discovery is much 
greater than the 200 to 400 parts per billion of uranium previously 
found in the aquifer 
the great miami aquifer is not used for drinking water but 
authorities say it is a potential drinking water source if the ohio 
river became too polluted to use 
mitchell said the new discovery is north of the previously known 
contamination meaning it probably comes from a new leak because 
water in the aquifer flows south toward the ohio river 
westinghouse materials co the plant operator hired a company 
to test the groundwater 
were concerned anytime we have uranium levels above 
background westinghouse spokesman bob walker said but this is 
an area where we were looking specifically for possible 
contamination thats why were going through all this 
the plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati processed uranium 
from 1951 until last summer for use in nuclear weapons and 
reactors processing was suspended to concentrate on cleanup the 
energy department which owns the plant acknowledged in 1985 that 
the plant had leaked radioactive dust 
marc johnston assistant general counsel for the energy 
department in washington said tuesday that the departments 
lawyers will meet soon with the fernaldarea residents attorney 
stanley chesley of cincinnati to discuss how the settlement will 
be paid for 
were very pleased chesley said were cautiously 
optimistic because we want to get it funded as soon as possible

it is superfluous gerlach said of the wall according to 
bild it will be replaced with normal border markings 
gerlach said he could not predict when the wall erected in 1961 
to stem an exodus of east german workers to the west would be 
taken down 
visiting czechoslovak president vaclav havel told reporters 
tuesday that gerlach had said the dismantling of the wall already 
has begun referring to the more than two dozen crossings punched 
through it in the past two months 
east germany lifted travel restrictions for its citizens on nov 
9 unleashing a joyous rush by millions to the west for visits and 
celebrations in the divided city 
a new crossing near the historic brandenburg gate was opened

rep joseph p kennedy 2nd has announced he will 
not run for governor in the fall taking a political 800pound 
gorilla out of the race 
the 37yearold democrat who announced his plans in a letter 
dated tuesday and sent to about 200 supporters ended months of 
speculation by saying he will instead seek reelection to congress 
in november 
i do not feel that i can provide the time effort or energy 
that a gubernatorial campaign would require and continue to meet my 
responsibilities as a father and as a congressman kennedy wrote 
as many of you are aware this is a particularly difficult 
time for my family that requires a great deal of personal 
attention 
kennedy a son of the late robert f kennedy announced in march 
that he and his wife of eight years sheila had separated they 
have twin sons 
recent polls indicated kennedy was preferred over three 
democrats expected to seek the nomination lt gov evelyn murphy 
former attorney general francis x bellotti and state rep john h 
flood 
flood said kennedys decision eliminates another 800pound 
gorilla any kennedy with the name with the financial resources 
and with the personality and charm they exude would have been 
tremendously strong 
boston university president john silber also is considered a 
likely candidate for the nomination and mayor raymond l flynn is 
considering running 
gov michael s dukakis a democrat is not seeking reelection 
kennedy was first elected in 1986 to the seat held by retiring 
house speaker thomas p tip oneill jr 
former us attorney william weld and state house minority 
leader steven d pierce are seeking the republican nomination

police have decided to replace 
the 11ton armored cars they have been using in the black township 
of soweto with normal police vehicles the new regional 
commissioner said today 
maj gen johan swart who took up his new post on tuesday 
urged the public in south africas largest city to see the change 
as a tangible sign of goodwill by the police i want the people 
of soweto to believe that the police only wish to carry out their 
normal duties swart said 
the armored vehicles painted bright yellow and called casspirs 
were a particular focus of anger during the unrest and political 
violence that wracked south africas largest black township from 
198486 
they enabled policemen to see over rooftops and down the narrow 
dirt streets of the townships and to fire into crowds of 
stonethrowing youths while being protected by the armor plating 
the landmineproof vehicles were also used by south african 
forces in the namibian guerrilla war which ended in april 
swart said six casspirs would be replaced immediately but the 
total project would be costly and take some time 
the name casspir is an acronym derived from the vehicles 
designers the council for scientific research and the south 
african police 
he said he had gained the impression that soweto was returning 
to normal after the violence of a few years ago but he said no 
decision had been made on withdrawal of army troops from the 
township of 25 million people 
the withdrawal of white soldiers from urban black townships has 
been a consistent demand of antiapartheid activists since the 
troops were sent to quell unrest in 1984

the foreign ministry today denied that it has 
agreed to let chinas leading dissident and his wife leave their 
safe haven in the us embassy and go into exile 
the only way out for fang lizhi and li shuxian is to plead 
guilty immediately and mend their ways so as not to alienate 
themselves from the people the ministry said according to the 
official xinhua news agency 
a hong kong magazine pai shing reported tuesday that the 
united states and china had reached an understanding to let the 
couple go into exile this month most likely in australia fang and 
li took refuge in the us embassy in beijing in june after chinese 
troops crushed massive prodemocracy protests 
white house officials have dismissed the report saying there 
are no new developments in the case the australian government also 
denied that a deal had been reached 
the magazine said china agreed to let the couple leave the 
country after us national security adviser brent scowcroft 
visited beijing in early december and sought to improve relations 
badly damaged by chinas crackdown on dissent and fangs flight to 
the embassy 
but the chinese foreign ministry said the recent rumors about 
the question of fang lizhi floating around abroad are speculations 
pure and simple we have repeatedly stated that fang lizhi and li 
shuxian have violated the criminal law of china 
it follows that this problem can only be solved according to 
the laws of china the united states on its part is obligated to 
work for its settlement 
fang 53 an astrophysicist and li a physics teacher long 
have been outspoken in their demand for democratic reforms and 
respect for human rights china has accused them of 
counterrevolutionary activity 
the united states decision to shelter fang has greatly strained 
relations between the two countries 
washington criticized the suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement but since has said the two countries need to set their 
differences aside and improve relations 
pai shing a leading publication reporting on chinese affairs 
said fang would leave the embassy before jan 27 the start of the 
chinese lunar new year the magazine said chinese leader deng 
xiaoping approved sending fang and his wife into exile on condition 
that fang refrain from political activities

the interim government of communist premier 
hans modrow today promised to keep political opponents better 
informed about national affairs and to consult prodemocracy forces 
before making important decisions 
modrows effort to appease disgruntled leaders of the new forum 
reform movement prevented the collapse of talks between the 
government and opposition groups as part of the ruling process 
until elections in may the talks are preparing drafts of proposed 
legislative and constitutional reforms 
on may 6 the first free balloting in the nations 40year 
history will select a 500member parliament which in turn will 
seat a new government 
because opposition forces view modrows communistdominated 
cabinet as transitional they contend its powers are limited and 
that decisions affecting important areas of national policy should 
take into consideration the views of grassroots reform movements 
modrow sent economics minister christa luft to todays session 
of the talks to assure the nearly 20 political parties and 
citizens movements represented there that they would be consulted 
regularly through may 6 in an apparent goodfaith gesture ms 
luft gave a detailed and gloomy account of the national economy in 
light of east germanys 206 billion foreign debt 
that makes the per capita debt higher than in poland 
but west german economic experts who had previously disclosed 
the foreign debt figure say east germanys overall economic 
profile is much better than that of poland or hungary two other 
eastern european nations struggling to carry out democratic and 
economic reforms 
modrow on tuesday invited representatives at the talks to form 
an advisory committee to work with his government new forum 
leaders had threatened to withdraw from the talks a move modrow 
strongly opposed 
if we do not succeed in building a climate of mutual trust we 
will not have the proper climate for the may 6 elections either 
the official adn news agency quoted him as saying 
the date for elections was determined at the first round of 
talks dec 7 
reinhard schult of the east berlin chapter of new forum which 
claims 200000 members nationwide complained at a news conference 
late tuesday that modrows cabinet has failed to keep the reform 
activists informed about ecological political and financial 
matters the group has specifically complained about east german 
officials agreeing to work with west german firms to improve 
nuclear power plant operations and output 
east germans have been swept into a whirlwind of reform over the 
past three months since massive prodemocracy marches by new forum 
and other groups forced hardliner erich honecker from the 
communist party leadership oct 18 
the party which has dominated social and political affairs 
throughout east german statehood relinquished its constitutional 
mandate to rule on dec 1 thereby reducing the communists to the 
same status as other political parties 
modrow a longtime advocate of reform enjoys broader support 
among east germans than any other communist figure but opposition 
leaders contend his government has no legitimacy as it was seated 
by the communistcontrolled parliament prior to the decline of the 
party

us efforts to pry ousted panamanian dictator 
manuel antonio noriega from the vatican embassy in panama city may 
be indirectly complicating the fate of another embassy fugitive a 
world away chinese dissident fang lizhi 
a senior bush administration official familiar with developments 
in china said the beijing government appears to be watching 
closely to see how the noriega episode plays out and watching 
with some sense of irony 
fang has been sheltered in the us embassy in beijing since the 
tiananmen square crackdown last june 
so far the united states has shown no more inclination to turn 
fang over to chinese officials who want to arrest him than the 
vatican has displayed in responding to us demands for noriega 
the administration official who did not wish to be quoted by 
name suggested china might first want to see how noriegas 
situation is resolved before getting involved in any plan to free 
fang to a third country 
bush administration officials on tuesday dismissed a report in a 
hong kong magazine that fang might soon be permitted to go into 
exile in australia or another country hes still in the embassy 
there have been no new developments white house spokesman roman 
popadiuk said 
the magazine the chineselanguage pai shino said the united 
states and china reached an understanding on ending the 
stalemate when national security adviser brent scowcroft visited 
beijing last month 
scowcroft said through white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater that theres no indication of a deal 
the chinese foreign ministry also denied the report the only 
way out for fang lizhi and li shuxian fangs wife is to plead 
guilty immediately and mend their ways so as not to alienate 
themselves from the people the ministry said today according to 
the official xinhua news agency 
likewise a spokesman for the australian foreign ministry in 
canberra said today there was no basis to the story 
there has been no deal no approach or suggestion that he 
should come to australia said the official who by custom could 
not be identified we have not been involved in any negotiations 
or discussions 
the official said special foreign ministry envoy michael 
costello was in beijing recently but that the issue of fangs 
possible release was not discussed 
but theres no doubt the united states wants to resolve the 
stalemate rather than having fang and his wife live in the embassy 
for the rest of their lives 
the bush administration considers fang an astrophysicist a 
victim of political persecution but sees noriega as a thug and 
indicted drugdealer still there are some parallels and that is 
forcing the united states to make different arguments for different 
hemispheres 
although us officials would welcome a thirdcountry solution 
for fang they have ruled one out for noriega too many american 
servicemen have died in panama for the united states to now 
consider permitting noriega a safe haven president bush has said 
while firmly refusing to turn over fang to chinese authorities 
the united states has leaned hard on the roman catholic church to 
turn over noriega not to panama but to americans 
but the vatican has said it is under no obligation to release 
noriega to an occupying power 
in its pursuit of noriega the united states has kept troops 
outside the vatican embassy and even bombarded it with loud rock 
music it would have aggravated me ill tell you bush said 
after he ordered it turned off 
the united states also raided the home of the nicaraguan 
ambassador in panama city on a tip that there was a large cache of 
arms there 
although the united states apologized for the intrusion and bush 
called it a screwup the episode could undermine the 
administrations arguments to the chinese about the sanctity of 
foreign embassy grounds 
dealings between the united states and the government of china 
are extremely fragile and scowcrofts two clandestine missions to 
beijing the first a bare month after the bloody crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators and the second last month have been 
roundly denounced by congressional democrats and many republicans 
thus seeking to arrange a deal with china on fangs fate is a 
very sensitive matter state department spokesman richard boucher 
said 
and that the united states must use one set of arguments in 
panama city and another in beijing can only make the efforts to 
free fang even more delicate

the leader of the moslem 
fundamentalist hamas movement went on trial in a military court 
today with relatives of a slain israeli soldier shrieking curses at 
him 
sheik ahmed ismail yassin 54 was charged with 15 offenses 
including belonging to an illegal organization organizing attacks 
on civilians and causing the deaths of two israeli soldiers ilan 
saadon and avi sassportaz 
i deny all charges yassin whispered to reporters in the 
courtroom in gaza city in the occupied gaza strip 
however his lawyer abdul malik bahanshe told the court that 
yassin founded hamas or zeal and helped transfer funds to the 
organization 
my client says it is not just his right but his obligation to 
establish these organizations to battle the occupation bahanshe 
said hes also not sorry for what he did 
hamas was founded within a month after the palestinian uprising 
against occupation began in december 1987 the gaza strip and west 
bank have been occupied by israel since they were captured from 
egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
government officials did not move quickly against hamas

in the charges they were granted an indefinite postponement after 
requesting time to study the charges fully israel radio said the

helicopters sprayed chemicals on a 
100squaremile oil slick today and patrol boats lay floating 
barriers in an effort to keep the goo away from the coastline 
where marine life and beaches were threatened 
about 19 million gallons of crude oil have spewed into the 
atlantic ocean from the iranian tanker khark 5 since an explosion 
tore through its hull dec 19 the slick was 20 miles from the 
moroccan coast 
in paris french environment minister brice lalonde said the 
284632ton tanker was being towed to more sheltered waters but 
still posed a threat to marine life 
environmental experts said high waves broke up much of the oil 
and that it dissolved in the 60degree seas 
spokesman daan kaakebeen of the dutch salvage firm smit tak said 
there had been no leakage for 24 hours but moroccos official news 
agency maghreb arabe presse said about 530 gallons continued to 
escape each hour 
three tugboats under command of smit tak were towing the ship 
toward calmer waters near the cape verde islands a journey 
expected to take eight days morocco and spain have refused to 
allow the vessel to be towed near sheltered waters off their coasts 
salvagers hoped the remaining cargo could be pumped into another 
iranian tanker at cape verde 
im concerned not only with whats going to happen to the 
moroccan coastbut with whats going to happen to the tanker now 
that its on the open seas lalonde said on the french television 
station antenne 2 he was in the former french colony to assess the 
spill 
kaakebeen said the khark 5 was 130 miles off the moroccan coast 
and that fair weather has reduced chances of it breaking up 
the oil threatened oyster beds fishing stocks a pink flamingo 
breeding ground and resort beaches officials said 100000 jobs 
depend on fishing and tourism there 
technicians laid floating cable to block the slicks advance 
cleanup crews vacuumed the floating oil which then was transferred 
to barges and helicopters sprayed chemicals to break up the spill 
and make it sink maghreb said 
kaakebeen said the tanker has 14 oil storage tanks he estimated 
the ship lost up to 60000 tons of its original cargo 
he said morocco and spain have refused to allow the khark 5 to 
be towed near their shores 
joe nichols technical manager of the international tanker 
owners pollution federation said the scale of the disaster would 
not approach last years exxon valdez catastrophe when 11 million 
gallons of alaskan crude spoiled 1000 miles of pristine coastline 
in prince william sound 
it is absolute poppycock to say this is one of the worlds 
worst disasters nichols said 
it is not the quantity of oil that matters but the location of 
the spill and the prevailing conditions he said it was a 
significant spillage but it took place about 150 miles offshore 
the khark 5 was loaded with 72 million gallons of oil when an 
explosion tore through its hull dec 19 about 400 miles north of 
las palmas in the canary islands 
the cause of the blast is unknown a fire forced the crew of 35 
to abandon ship and the vessel began drifting toward northwest 
africa 
hassan mohammedi a spokesman for irans environmental 
protection agency said the incident had been exaggerated by the 
imperialist media 
it is normal for such accidents to occur in stormy 
conditions irans official islamic republic news agency quoted 
him as saying this is an ordinary matter

asbells office is leading the investigation into the attack 
state police and the attorney generals office also are 
investigating 
the state is approaching this as a very serious incident

prosecutor was cut on his hands from the shattered glass but did

president corazon aquino swore in 
nine new cabinet members today and appealed for teamwork to solve 
the philippines problems in the wake of last months bloody coup 
attempt 
using her emergency powers mrs aquino ordered that all 
firearms be registered anew voiding the previous master list of 
people or entities with gun licenses 
also today opposition sen juan ponce enrile denied allegations 
he was linked to the coup attempt which lasted dec 19 and said 
the charges against him were a witchhunt aimed at eliminating mrs 
aquinos opponents 
the new cabinet members taking their oaths of office at the 
malacanang presidential palace included the newly designated 
secretaries of justice agriculture education transport finance 
agrarian reform and mrs aquinos press secretary legal affairs 
adviser and military adviser 
we have only 800 days left in office and we must be able to 
deliver to the people the services they so justly deserve mrs 
aquino said after the ceremony 
tomas gomez who was sworn in as press secretary said mrs 
aquino stressed the need for cooperation during the closeddoor 
cabinet meeting which followed the oathtaking 
the president reiterated team spirit and i was impressed 
because i thought there was a conscious attempt to reach out and 
achieve that team spirit and coordination said gomez a former 
philippine consul in honolulu 
gomez quoted mrs aquino as telling the cabinet to please give 
me a very speedy action line 
mrs aquino revamped her cabinet on sunday after widespread 
criticism that her administration had failed to address the 
nations social economic and political problems 
those demands reached a climax last month when thousands of 
military mutineers launched the sixth and strongest attempt so far 
to topple mrs aquino since she took office in february 1986 
congress expanded the powers of a commission investigating the 
uprising giving it the right among other things to look into 
bank accounts of suspected putsch supporters 
a consolidated version of bills from the senate and house of 
representatives creating the commission was passed in both 
chambers called into special session by mrs aquino to approve the 
legislation 
sen jose lina said the commission would investigate last 
months coup attempt and recommend measures which will prevent 
similar attempts at a violent seizure of power 
the bill gives the commission quasijudicial powers including 
the right to grant immunity from prosecution to witnesses it 
protects witnesses against selfincrimination in testimony they are 
forced to give before the commission 
it also allows the commission to require the monetary board to 
disclose information or grant authority to examine bank accounts if 
it has reasonable ground to believe the funds were used in the 
coup attempt

atom spy klaus fuchs did practically nothing to 
help the soviets develop a hydrogen bomb because much of what he 
passed along was faulty data nuclear experts have concluded 
the new york times today reported that those experts in a 
series of recent books and journal articles suggested that the 
soviets learned more about how to make the weapon by analyzing 
fallout from american hbomb tests 
according to the researchers the material fuchs gave the 
soviets came from flawed early work by edward teller who has been 
described at the father of the hydrogen bomb 
it was long believed that fuchs a british subject and physicist 
who worked on the manhattan project to develop the atomic bomb 
during world war ii gave the soviets the secret to the hbomb 
he confessed to spying in 1950 he was imprisoned and later 
released he died in east germany in january the united states 
exploded the worlds first hydrogen bomb in 1952 the soviets 
detonated their first fullscale hbomb in 1955 
the researchers relying in part on a declassified version of a 
topsecret history of the hbomb program said that fuchs left the 
us weapons program in 1946 and thus had access only to faulty 
assumptions and calculations that plagued the program in its early 
years 
the revisionist researchers working independently included 
daniel hirsch and william g matthews writing on fuchs and the 
fallout question in the january issue of the bulletin of the atomic 
scientists thomas b cochran and robert s norris authors of 
the nuclear weapons databook chuck hanson author of us 
nuclear weapons the secret history and stanley b blumberg and 
louis g panos authors of the upcoming book edward teller

the pentagon today defended plans to take over 
millions of additional acres of public lands for combat training 
arguing that more room is needed to train soldiers and pilots in 
the use of modern weaponry 
the expansion plans have been sharply criticized by 
environmentalists and ranchers especially in western states where 
more than 3 million additional acres are sought by the defense 
department for expanded bombing runs and tank maneuvers 
testifying before a house interior subcommittee pentagon 
officials said modern technology requires exanded training areas 
to provide the realism of combat 
todays highspeed modern tactical aircraft fly over large 
ground ranges in a matter of seconds today a mechanized army 
battalion needs more than 80000 acres to practice standard 
maneuvers compared to 4000 acres during world war ii said 
robert stone deputy assistant defense secretary for installations 
but the militarys grab for land has sparked controversy across 
much of the west from montana to california and also in 
mississippi where the state national guard thinks the desoto 
national forest is just the place for tank maneuvers 
among critics called to appear later at the hearing were several 
idaho and montana ranchers as well as representatives from 
environmental and citizen groups who argue the military is locking 
the public out of too many acres of federal land 
several congressmen said however that defense needs might have 
to override other concerns 
rep larry craig ridaho in whose state the air force wants to 
vastly expand a bombing range said that while local interests must 
be taken into account it also is critical to the country that 
the military training is the best it can be 
the military currently uses more than 19 million acres of land 
belonging to the federal bureau of land management or the us 
forest service it wants to expand those holdings by 34 million 
acres in seven western states alone according to congressional 
estimates 
the growing appetite for more public lands on which to 
practice war games appears to be out of sync with the warming of 
relations between the us and the soviet bloc said rep bruce 
vento dminn chairman of the national parks and public lands 
subcommittee 
the forest service and the blm have not publicly protested the 
defense departments intentions within the administration the 
dod is like a 600pound gorilla and gets its way vento said in 
an interview tuesday 
but in some regions the push to expand military training bases 
has prompted a modernday range war between the military and an 
unusual alliance of environmentalists cattlemen and citizens 
groups 
in idaho a plan by the air force to vastly expand the saylor 
creek bombing range from 100000 acres to 15 million acres is 
prompting loud protests ranchers say the expansion will drive them 
out of desirable grazing land on the high plateau 
environmentalists argue the bombing will ruin the countryside and 
destroy a valuable wildlife habitat 
roger hayes who represents several idaho environmental groups 
said some of the miles of the scenic land coveted by the air force 
already is being considered for wilderness protection status it is 
home to a wide array of birds and wildlife including the bald eagle 
and nearly onethird of the worlds population of california 
bighorn sheep he said 
thats one reason the air force wants to take over 500000 
additional acres along the nevadautah border where plans call for 
a new electronic battlefield for jet fighters 
the navy also wants 240000 acres of public land in nevada for 
range and air crew training while nevadas army guard has set 
its sights on 586000 acres of public grazing land for tank 
training 
bob fulkerson executive director of citizen alert a 
nevadabased environmental group says the military is empire 
building and maintains the training plans would lock up 4 million 
acres of federal land now available to the public and wildlife 
large areas of land also are being sought for national guard 
training in montana where up to 900000 acres are in question and 
in mississippi where the state national guard wants to expand camp 
shelby onto the nearby 116000acre desoto national forest the 
additional land would be used for tank maneuvers by guard units 
from a number of states

the coast guard today said it is investigating 
whether dozens of barges torn from their moorings by rushing chunks 
of ice in the rain and snowswollen monongahela river had been 
secured properly 
the operators of the mooring areas in the 58mile stretch of 
river where at least 55 barges broke away new years day could be 
fined up to 1000 per vessel cmdr tony regalbuto said the coast 
guard on dec 26 had warned operators a thaw was expected by the 
weekend regalbuto said 
they knew this was coming said paul behers spokesman for 
the pennsylvania department of environmental resources 
they are presumed negligent because you dont expect a barge 
thats fixed to the shore to break away on its own regalbuto 
said 
in crashing downstream one of the barges spilled 10000 gallons 
of gasoline although state officials said environmental damage was 
slight another barge holding 420000 gallons of fuel was pried 
from a dam tuesday its cargo intact 
thirty of the barges sank prompting the coast guard to halt 
river traffic along a 20mile stretch south of pittsburgh some of 
the submerged vessels were empty others carried coal the river 
will reopen as soon as all the sunken barges are located possibly 
by thursday said coast guard lt rhae giacoma 
the coast guard planned to scan the closed portion of the river 
this evening after receiving sonar equipment from the army corps of 
engineers 
in new jersey about 5000 gallons of heating oil spilled from a 
pipe linking an exxon corp plant in linden with its refinery in 
bayonne 
the break tuesday caused an 11mile slick that tainted six miles 
of shoreline on new yorks staten island officials said 
john hagerty spokesman for the new jersey department of 
environmental protection said no environmentally sensitive areas 
were threatened by the spill which occurred in an area ringed with 
industrial plants and oil terminals 
the gasoline that spilled in pennsylvania was on a barge that 
drifted from mon river towing incs dock at speers 44 miles 
upstream from pittsburgh over the locks and dam at charleroi 28 
miles south of pittsburgh it hit the monongahela bridge before 
coming to rest at new eagle 14 miles farther downstream 
two other barges broke loose from mon river towing 15 from an

a spokesman for the contra rebels 
today dismissed government allegations the usbacked rebels were 
responsible for an ambush that killed two nuns including an 
american and injured an american bishop 
the body of sister maureen courtney of milwaukee arrived in 
managua on tuesday night before being flown to the united states 
the attack occurred monday in a remote area of zelaya province 
250 miles northeast of managua as sister courtney and three other 
church workers drove in a church pickup truck from the town of 
rosita to puerto cabezas 
i only know that a mine went off or a grenade and there was 
heavy shooting afterward said bishop pablo schmitz of fond du 
lac wis we identified ourselves but nobody came to the 
pickup 
schmitz the auxiliary bishop of the port city of bluefields 
told reporters it was very dark outside when the attack 
occurred so he could not identify the assailants 
church officials said it was possible the pickup may have hit a 
land mine but schmitz also suffered a gunshot wound to the left 
arm sister francisca colomer 24 of nicaragua suffered wounds in 
the face and body both were hospitalized in managua and were 
expected to survive 
sister courtney 45 was of the sisters of st agnes order of 
fond du lac and had been doing missionary work in nicaragua 15 
years she was believed to be the first american killed in the 
9yearold civil war since contras killed 27yearold engineer 
benjamin linder of portland ore in april 1987 
the slain nicaraguan nun was identified as sister teresa 
rosales of santa marta 
the incident comes at a time of tense usnicaraguan relations 
which took a turn for the worse after the american invasion of 
panama and us soldiers illegal search of the nicaraguan 
ambassadors residence 
contra military leader enrique bermudez said in miami this 
morning that he doubted contras were responsible for the ambush 
we have not received any report from patrols of that kind of 
action he said in a telephone interview these type of 
accusations are normally made by the sandinistas in order to wage 
a publicity campaign against us 
he said contras did not have a presence in the area where the 
attack occurred 
however the regional deputy police commander julio rugama 
said about 60 contra rebels operate in the region and were 
responsible for the attack 
the new york times today quoted lt col juan lorenzo santana as 
saying the church workers were apparently attacked because they 
came upon a group of contras planting a mine in the road 
and jaime arauz one of two peasants questioned by sandinista 
officials told reporters he and the other peasant were kidnapped 
by a group of rebels who told them they were waiting to ambush an 
army convoy 
the government radio voz de nicaragua said the attackers were 
contra forces encouraged by the invasion of us troops in 
panama 
us soldiers invaded panama on dec 20 and ousted the regime of 
gen manuel antonio noriega then surrounded the nicaraguan embassy 
in case noriega decided to seek refuge there 
later that week us soldiers searched the panama city 
residence of nicaraguas ambassador antenor ferrey washington 
admitted the search of the diplomatic premises was a mistake 
nicaragua expelled 20 american diplomats from managua in 
retaliation 
the area where the attack occurred is a stronghold of the 
miskito indians who for years have mounted sporadic military 
operations against the sandinistas independent of the contras 
norma venkler a classmate of maureen courtney in the 1960s at 
divine savior holy angels high school in milwaukee said her friend 
was setting up an education system for the miskito indians 
frances courtney sister courtneys mother told journalists in 
wauwatosa wis that her daughter had been in nicaragua for 15 
years 
she was supposed to celebrate her 25th jubilee in the order 
this december the mother said she was just a lovely little 
girl 
sister jean steffes mother superior for the sisters of st 
agnes said in wisconsin that it was the first time members of her 
order were killed doing missionary work 
schmitz went to nicaragua as a missionary in 1972 and was 
ordained auxiliary bishop in 1984 and belonged to the capuchin 
order of the franciscans according to brother larry la cross a 
capuchin spokesman in detroit 
about 35 capuchin missionaries work in nicaragua 
the usbacked contras began their fight against the nicaraguan 
government in 1981 saying the sandinistas had betrayed the popular 
revolution that toppled anastasio somoza in 1979 
a fragile ceasefire ended on nov 1 1988 and fighting has 
been sporadic since us military aid to the contras ran out in 
february 1988 but congress has continued to provide nonlethal aid 
president bush has said he wants to keep the contras intact to 
ensure that the sandinistas remain true to their promise of free 
elections on feb 25 
the radio said president daniel ortega visited the victims 
tuesday night to express his condolences

president bush who has pledged repeatedly not 
to raise taxes is likely to propose a levy on industry for the use 
of certain raw materials to encourage recycling administration 
sources said today 
the proposal is expected to be part of bushs fiscal 1991 budget 
blueprint which he will present to congress jan 29 said 
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
bush pledged repeatedly in the 1988 campaign and again last year 
not to raise taxes he said a few weeks ago in a yearend interview 
that he hoped to stick with that resolution the sources said they 
considered a levy on raw materials for recycling more in the nature 
of a user fee than a tax 
the aim of the proposal first reported by the wall street 
journal in todays editions would be to make it cheaper for 
industries to use recycled rather than new materials 
we want to encourage recycling for obvious reasons said 
deputy white house press secretary stephen hart he declined to 
discuss the proposal but said work is underway in the 
administration to produce a major recycling package next year 
in other budget developments congressional sources said tuesday 
that bush will ask congress to cut the low income home energy 
assistance program which helps the poor pay their heating bills 
from 139 billion this year to 105 billion for fiscal 1991 
this is a program that is terribly inadequately funded 
already said charles hill managing attorney for the national 
consumer law center in washington 
about 61 million american households receive assistance under 
the program about onethird the total that qualify for the aid 
supporters say the 1991 fiscal year begins oct 1 
federal energy assistance to the poor which started soon after 
the 1973 arab oil embargo peaked at 21 billion in 1985 when 68 
million households were served it has been cut steadily ever since 
as it became a favorite target for proposed reductions during the 
reagan administration 
this program has been cut enough over the last few years 
said ed block executive director of the national association of 
community action programs 
the program helps poor families and individuals pay part of 
their heating bills some money also is used to help the poor cover 
air conditioning and insulating expenses and to aid families in 
danger of losing their heating service about half of the 
households served include elderly or disabled people 
spokeswoman barbara clay of the office of management and budget 
declined to comment on the proposal margot simmons spokeswoman 
for the department of health and human services which runs the 
heating aid program also declined comment 
supporters of the program said there is no way to predict how 
the proposed cuts if enacted would affect people who receive 
assistance the federal government funnels the money to the states 
territories and indian tribes which are free to set their own 
criteria for distribution in the past some states have responded 
to cutbacks by reducing the number of eligible recipients while 
others have shrunk the size of benefits 
the program has widespread support in congress where bushs 
proposal is likely to be strongly opposed last year bush proposed 
providing 11 billion for the program but lawmakers ended up 
setting aside 139 billion 
word of the proposal comes after one of the coldest decembers on 
record a month in which heating oil prices shot up dramatically in 
some parts of the country in massachusetts for example heating 
oil costs surged from 88 cents per gallon a year ago to 141 per 
gallon last week 
the average participating household received 204 in heating 
assistance last year simmons said in most states the money goes 
directly to the local utility which deducts it from the 
households bill 
program supporters say the benefits typically cover only about 
20 percent of a lowincome households annual energy bill 
the jan 29 date for submitting the budget is a week later than 
the jan 22 deadline set by budget law and budget chief richard g 
darman suggested tuesday that late congressional action on fiscal 
legislation last fall made it impossible to meet the dealine 
the delay in the 1991 budget proposal also will push back bushs 
first state of the union address from jan 25 to jan 30 according 
to administration and congressional sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
administration sources said the budget for the 1991 fiscal year 
starting oct 1 will call for 123 trillion in spending to meet a 
64 billion budget deficit target without proposing new taxes or 
wholesale reductions in domestic programs

nuns were killed when their pickup drove over a grenade which 
exploded and the truck was then ambushed by people who didnt seem 
to realize they were church workers 
as soon as the people in the jeep yelled were religious 
the shooting stopped steffes said by then sister maureen was 
killed and sister teresa dejesus was also killed 
steffes said residents of a tiny village near the scene of the 
attack recovered the bodies and took the two injured people into 
their homes the villagers stayed up all night and prayed with 
them she said 
i am deeply saddened by this attack and hope that the 
perpetrators and their motives will become clearer milwaukee

courtney and the orders 20 other missionaries were not 
politically motivated steffes said 
they simply were there to be with the people she said 
a 45yearold native of milwaukee courtney worked for 15 years 
in central america most recently teaching sewing and catechism at 
a school in port decasus nicaragua and helping establish a

assigned someplace other than nicaragua the family said 
she understood what she was in for but she loved the type of 
work she was in said norma venkler a classmate of courtneys at 
divine savior holy angels high school in milwaukee in the 1960s 
she chose to go back she felt that was what she was called to 
do 
schmitz the injured prelate went to nicaragua as a missionary 
in 1972 and was ordained auxiliary bishop in 1984 said the rev 
larry la cross a spokesman for the capuchin order provincial 
headquarters in detroit 
at a friary of the order of capuchin franciscan friars near fond 
du lac the rev dan crosby said the incident makes you think of 
the situation that occurred just recently in el salvador with the 
six jesuits being slain 
somehow or other one has to question all the american money 
that is going into that region why is this happening why does it 
continue crosby said 
steffes said a funeral for courtney would be held friday in fond

north americas movie theaters reaped a 
record 5 billionplus at the box office in 1989 powered by the 
punch of batman and other highly promoted action films 
despite a lackluster christmas holiday season summertime 
moviegoers spun the turnstiles at such a dizzying pace that the 
boxoffice record of 445 billion from 1988 was smashed according 
to figures released tuesday 
the boxoffice total based on industry estimates was set by 
fewer films 446 features made their debuts in 1989 down 13 
percent from the previous year 
in the studiobystudio race warner bros was no 1 with an 
estimated 171 percent share of all us and canadian tickets sold 
the studios batman was the years biggest blockbuster its 
2512 million in ticket sales was fifthhighest in history 
disney which some analysts didnt expect to be competitive 
finished fifth with a healthy 138 percent share 
although part of the revenue surge is attributable to higher 
ticket prices admissions are projected to be greater than last 
year 
in large part the record year was propelled by expensive and 
heavily marketed star vehicles such as batman and indiana 
jones and the last crusade which made 196 million and lethal 
weapon 2 which collected 147 million according to trade 
publications and private research firms 
right behind the lightly regarded honey i shrunk the kids 
emerged as 1989s no 4 film with receipts of 130 million it was 
followed by the 1988 holdover rain man 127 million 
i think honey i shrunk the kids was a terrific surprise for 
us said david hoberman president of walt disney pictures and 
its touchstone pictures division i think there is a market for 
good original films 
both honey and dead poets society were out there competing 
with a lot of sequels and enormous budget films and they competed 
pretty nicely in that marketplace 
the rest of the years top 10 were ghostbusters ii 112 
million look whos talking 109 million parenthood 95 
million touchstones dead poets society 94 million and 
when harry met sally 91 million 
owing partly to cold weather and that christmas fell on a 
monday this years holiday season was off from a year ago the 
scarce hits included back to the future part ii and national 
lampoons christmas vacation 
the boxoffice figures only hint at the film industrys robust 
health home video and cable television receipts now account for 
about 57 percent of studio revenues compared with about 30 percent 
earned at movie houses according to paul kagan associates 
some analysts believe hollywoods record year might mean studios 
will produce and release fodder most of these movies never 
should have been made said ad murphy who follows boxoffice 
revenues for daily variety 
of 1989s top five only rain man released first in 1988 
was widely praised by reviewers and several critically acclaimed 
films such as do the right thing the fabulous baker boys 
and heathers did modest business 
among independent films the top performers were sex lies and 
videotape with 24 million and women on the verge of a nervous 
breakdown with more than 7 million 
the years biggest flops include casualties of war 
blaze were no angels old gringo fat man and 
little boy lockup the abyss young einstein and 
just about every movie from the orion studios shedevil 
valmont great balls of fire erik the viking and 
heart of dixie 
a companion survey conducted by orbit video magazine of the 
decades biggest boxoffice stars revealed a mildly surprising name 
as the eras most popular actor harrison ford fords movies 
according to the magazines january survey made 1064 billion 
dan aykroyd owing much to the two ghostbusters movies and a 
brief appearance in indiana jones and the temple of doom was 
second with 871 million eddie murphy was third with 828 million 
bill murrays work generated ticket sales of 696 million for 
fourth place and tom cruise was fifth with 636 million 
the top actress was kim basinger in 15th place overall with 
combined sales of 432 million

first lady barbara bush today began 10 days of 
radiation treatment for eye swelling and impaired vision resulting 
from a troublesome thyroid condition and said she felt fine 
afterward the white house said 
mrs bush went to walter reed army medical center for the 
10minute treatment which will be repeated on each of the next 
nine days said spokeswoman jean becker 
she looks fine she says she feels fine and her first 
treatment has been completed white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater told reporters he said he had seen mrs bush this 
morning as she was en route to visit president bush in his office 
following the treatment 
the first lady suffers from graves disease which has resulted 
in a swelling behind her eyes causing tearing and double vision 
the radiation focused on bony canals behind the eyes called 
orbits is intended to reduce the swelling becker said the 
muscles that are swollen are in the orbit area 
the radiation treatment will not prevent mrs bush from carrying 
out her normal schedule the spokeswoman said 
mrs bush 64 was diagnosed with graves disease last year and 
was prescribed the drug prednisone to treat the eye side effect 
she also was given one dose of a radioactive liquid treatment to 
treat the thyroid aspect of the disease that treatment was 
effective but the eye side effect has remained her office says 
the prednisone has not improved her condition although she is 
still able to read and go about a normal schedule of activities 
if the radiation is not successful surgery would be an option 
step one was the drug shes been taking that didnt work 
becker said so this is the next step she said of the 
radiation 
graves disease causes an overproduction of hormones and 
initially caused mrs bush a dramatic weight loss over a period of 
weeks the radioactive treatment and use of the drug methimazole 
halted the irregular hormone production by destroying the thyroid 
gland 
mrs bushs press secretary anna perez said the first lady 
will continue to take prednisone for a time but at a reduced level 
until she is completely off it 
perez said doctors decided to switch to radiation as an option 
to the prospect of longterm use of prednisone a steroid that has 
side effects including water retention 
they wanted to take her off the prednisone perez said 
they just didnt want that longterm medication 
mrs bush is under the care of white house physician dr burton 
lee drs kenneth burman and frank lapiana at walter reed and dr 
robert waller of the mayo clinic in rochester minn

the government rushed more border troops to the 
southern republic of azerbaijan today to try to stop a rampage by 
thousands of people along the boundary with iran a newspaper 
reported 
one person was killed in a clash among the protesters the 
official news agency tass reported today border guards did not use 
their weapons and none were injured it said the report did not 
say how many protesters were injured 
the government daily izvestia said more than 4000 people tore 
down guard towers and destroyed electronic alarms along the border 
the rioters want southern azerbaijan to be unified with northern 
iran and have threatened to remove all barriers at the border 
unless authorities remove them the newspaper reported 
azerbaijanis have said they merely want the right to freely visit 
friends and relatives on the other side of the border 
tass had said in the first report about the violence tuesday 
that the rioters were high on drugs or alcohol and didnt 
mention political motives 
izvestia in a report quoting i petrovas head of the kgbs 
caucasus border district mentioned only the political motives and 
said protesters had been plotting the rampage for weeks 
practically along the entire border between azerbaijan and 
iran a complex situation has emerged this is about 490 miles on 
land izvestia said 
none of the reports mentioned any injuries or deaths but 
izvestia said damage exceeds 82 million 
the turmoil is the latest violence in the caucasus a region 
torn for two years by strife among azerbaijanis armenians 
georgians and other ethnic groups the sending of reinforcements 
showed that the elite kgb guards stationed along the border were 
incapable of ending the violence 
the official news reports have not said how many border troop 
reinforcements were being sent or how many are already in the 
region 
iran accused the soviets of violating a border agreement 
isvestia said 
vagiv samedoglu editor of the azerbaijan peoples front 
newspaper called the tass report of attacks by drunken 
narcoticsinfluenced mobs a lie written in moscow 1200 miles 
north of nakhichevan 
he said however that soviet azerbaijanis had been camped along 
the border for nearly a month in hopes of seeing relatives and 
friends on the other side the azerbaijanis are the only soviet 
ethnic group who like iranians are largely shiite moslems 
about 4 million ethnic azerbaijanis live in the adjoining 
iranian province of azerbaijan alone their soviet kin want an open 
border and the freedom to trade and cross the frontier practices 
that were suspended by dictator josef stalin samedoglu said by 
telephone from baku azerbaijans capital 
a rally was held sunday in baku to demand an open border and 
pickets renewed the call tuesday in front of azerbaijans interior 
ministry headquarters and supreme soviet legislature samedoglu 
said 
soviets must submit to checks at the frontier and receive 
permission to leave from kgb border troops 
iranian media monitored in nicosia cyprus had no immediate 
report on the rampage but tass reported that iranian border 
commissioners issued a protest saying the actions by extremist 
elements are insulting to iran and requesting the soviets act to 
quell the disorders 
telephones rang unanswered tuesday night at azerbaijans 
official news agency azerinform and attempts to obtain more 
information were unsuccessful 
tass said irresponsible elements were trying to aggravate 
tensions in azerbaijan and the caucasus as a whole and provoke a 
brutal response from authorities it did not elaborate 
like the soviet baltic republics the caucasus has seen the 
emergence under mikhail s gorbachevs more permissive rule of 
popular grass roots movements that are demanding independence or 
greater autonomy 
the more liberal political atmosphere has also aggravated 
longsimmering ethnic tensions which have in the past year boiled 
over into violence that has claimed dozens of lives and displaced 
tens of thousands of people 
violence first was reported in nakhichevan a 2200squaremile 
azerbaijani enclave sandwiched between armenia and iran in 
november 1988 when armenian media said gangs of azerbaijanis had 
ransacked armenians homes 
many ethnic armenians then fled to the neighboring republic of 
armenia there they joined refugees from the nagornokarabakh 
enclave of azerbaijan who felt threatened because of ethnic attacks 
sparked by a continuing territorial dispute over nagornokarabakh 
it was in nagornokarabakh which is predominantly armenian 
that a crowd on tuesday attacked a bus convoy carrying azerbaijanis 
with stones and firearms in the city of stepanakert tass said 
cadets from the police school for purposes of selfdefense 
returned the fire the agency reported and one stepanakert 
resident was killed and three wounded 
armenians and azerbaijanis have been fighting since february 
1988 over claims to the enclave

the provisional government today named 
an executive committee apparently empowered with final say in 
running the country another new political party criticized the 
governments plans for elections in april 
a soldier was seriously wounded by sniper fire overnight the 
attack was a reminder that holdouts from nicolae ceausescus hated 
secret police still pose a threat tanks and troops defending the 
revolution remained in bucharests streets 
the wounded soldier was admitted to bucharest emergency hospital 
with a bullet wound in the temple doctors described his condition 
as very serious but released no details 
romanias army chief of staff col gen vasile ionel repeated 
claims that 60000 people died under ceausescus 24year rule and 
he said 196 army officers and noncommissioned officers were killed 
in the battle to oust him 
he did not give a figure for nonofficers who bore the brunt of 
the fighting that ended with ceausescus execution christmas day 
just how many died in the revolution will be found out later 
on he said 
western diplomats in bucharest citing witness accounts and 
their own assessments believe 10000 people have died

the romanian democratic party said he thought april was too 
soon for elections 
the christian democratic national peasants party has also 
called for postponement of the elections to prevent the national

half of the year free trade unions and the right to strike the 
elimination of the communist partys leading role continued 
membership in the warsaw pact possible membership in the european

german counterpart hansdietrich genscher will visit romania in

hundreds of black youngsters boycotted class 
today over the school boards refusal to renew the contract of 
selmas first black superintendent 
about a dozen pickets including some children appeared outside 
selma high school to encourage the boycott and others protested at 
several of the 10 other schools in the city the site in 1965 of a 
bloody civil rights clash 
school superintendent norward roussell who implored students 
not to boycott despite the decision dec 21 by the whitemajority 
school board said about 25 percent of the systems 6039 students 
were absent he said the system which is nearly 70 percent black 
normally has a 10 percent absenteeism rate the first day after 
winter break 
the five blacks on the school board resigned after the six 
whites declined to extend roussells contract beyond june some 
community members have also protested by withdrawing thousands of 
dollars from two banks with ties to school board members 
this is not about me and its not about the school system 
roussell said today its about what happened on the pettus 
bridge 25 years ago 
black voting rights marchers were clubbed and routed in clouds 
of tear gas by mounted troopers in 1965 as they crossed the edmund 
pettus bridge the bloodshed helped inspire passage by congress of 
the voting rights act 
some of the boycotting students today were taken by parents or 
demonstration leaders to a baptist church where a lawyer and 
others spoke to them about civil rights history 
mayor joe smitherman said videotapes taken of students 
participating in the boycott would be sent to school officials for 
possible disciplinary action 
roussell 55 became superintendent in 1987 the board cited a 
job evaluation it would not make public in not renewing his 
contract 
roussell then released the evaluation which described him as 
dictatorial and said his demanding of blind compliance led to a 
lowering of teacher morale roussell disputed the findings and 
called them unsubstantiated

throughout the country

the evening sun baltimore on the rise in social security rates 
speaking of reading lips president bushs promise of no new 
taxes will become a cruel joke this week for 50 millionplus 
american workers whose payroll tax for social security goes up 
significantly on the first workday of the new year 
the base salary on which the socalled fica tax is levied goes 
up from 48000 to 51300 and the rate itself goes up from 751 
percent to 765 percent the employers share also goes up 
commensurately which means that money that might have been used 
for higher pay must go to pay social security taxes 
bush is continuing the free ride through deception which 
ronald reagan enjoyed throughout his administration by using social 
security surpluses to disguise the truly devastating nature of the 
growing federal debt 
a fedup sen daniel patrick moynihan is saying to bush if you 
really are opposed to new taxes join me in repealing the increases 
which go into effect jan 2 
this is not going to happen because if it did the whole house 
of cards on which reaganbush fiscal policy is based would come 
crashing down moynihans tactic does expose the hypocrisy of that 
policy one that means raising the regressive tax against 
middleand even lowerincome americans while granting tax breaks to 
the wealthy 
by years end a single worker earning 51300 will pay 320 
more twoworker families will be hit even harder and even someone 
earning 10000 a year will pay an additional 14 
read bushs lips you will see he is lying

the marion ohio star on trade with the pacific rim 
the bush administration while not ignoring europe has been 
wise to quietly join the asian pacific economic corp a 12nation 
consortium of pacific rim nations organized to coordinate trade and 
boost business in the region 
a lot of attention has been paid to the impending union of 
european nations in 1992 but us trade with east asia has tripled 
since 1978 and currently at 280 billion a year runs 55 percent 
above total americaneuropean trade nations around the pacific rim 
account for almost half the worlds gross national product 
the new consortium will help promote us exports by dismantling 
trade barriers and promoting investment the united states with 
its growing asian population should be in an improved position by 
virtue of its having joined the new consortium

the philadelphia inquirer on romania and panama 
in one of those odd confluences of unrelated events the dramas 
in panama and romania have been playing themselves out in tandem 
for a time it even seemed possible that the two stories might 
converge that the fleeing ceausescus and the fleeing noriega 
would reemerge simultaneously in a place like cuba which seems 
anxious to carve out a niche as the last refuge of scoundrels 
over the holiday weekend though the stories took divergent 
turns the voodooworshiping noriega turns himself in to the popes 
man in panama city on christmas eve the atheist ceausescus are 
summarily tried and executed on christmas day in both panama and 
romania the people on the streets are celebrating the vanquishing 
of hated rulers and preparing for what they hope will be better and 
calmer days ahead 
what lessons might we draw during this pause in the action in 
the case of nicolae ceausescu and his wife elena it seems 
transparent violence begets violence six eastern european nations 
rid themselves of orthodox communist leadership this year only in 
romania did the losing side resort to widescale bloodshed and 
only in romania did the deposed rulers meet a bloody end 
in panama the revolution was born in the situation room of the 
white house gen noriega was brought down by us troops pure and 
simple and yet panamanians seem nearly as pleased and relieved as 
the people of romania its as if they wanted to do it themselves 
but they didnt know how 
the ultimate success of the us endeavor in panama will not 
depend on whether noriega ends up in jail on the gallows or in 
comfortable exile it will depend on whether the panamanians take 
advantage of this opportunity for renewal to build a better 
society their new leaders share this advantage with romanias 
provisional government things could hardly get worse

los angeles daily news on bush china and romania 
in terms of their desire to be free how are the chinese any 
different from romanians its wrong to assume that china 
cant topple its dictators as romania has just done if president 
bush could grasp that point he would understand what a mistake it 
is for him to be cozying up to beijings communists 
by every indication chinas tyrants are running scared 
communist leaders are understandably concerned about comparisons 
being drawn between the romanian revolt and the prodemocracy 
protests in tiananmen square in june 
in both cases for example the demonstrations gained a momentum 
that could only be possible in countries where the people are 
enormously deprived and discontented and chinese premier li 
peng last week ordered the peoples armed police to guard against 
any renewal of prodemocracy protests inspired by romanias 
example 
last week li told a meeting of the state council chinas 
cabinet that despite the changes in the international situation 
china will maintain a firm belief in itself and adhere to the 
socialist direction 
whether or not li believes his own rhetoric theres no reason 
for bush to swallow even a single word of it unfortunately the 
president continues to defiantly defend his overtures to beijing as 
the right thing to do under the circumstances but as the events 
in romania have shown most convincingly circumstances have a way 
of changing overnight

the 1990s look ominous for the worlds diehard dictators 
take china where communist party leaders who ordered the brutal 
crackdown in tiananmen square last summer were clearly shaken by 
what happened to romanias hardline leader nicolae ceausescu 
the chinese government had long maintained close ties with 
ceausescu pledging military unity and revolutionary friendship 
with him even as communism collapsed in the rest of eastern europe 
now according to a western diplomat in beijing the 
leadership is twitching with fear 
their bunker mentality was revealed in a recent internal 
memorandum that reportedly told officials what to think and say 
about romania ie to remain internationally neutral but

san antonio expressnews on the soviet union and the baltics 
mikhail gorbachev enters the 1990s on a tightrope poised 
between mutually exclusive goals his acrobatic prowess is about to 
be tested yet again perhaps decisively in the baltics 
gorbachev wants communism without having to impose it by force 
but as soon as they are given a choice large numbers of his people 
express their contempt for communism nowhere is this more evident 
than in the baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania which 
were independent between the world wars before the red army 
occupied them 
as dissident andrei sakharov warned there is no stable solution 
short of selfdetermination by the soviet people and gorbachev is 
bold enough to carry it out if he wants to 
but if he tries to use force in the baltics he will suffer from 
western censure and isolation the united states must leave no 
doubt that it recognizes the baltic peoples right to sovereign 
selfrule

daily news starkville miss on cuba 
the demise of communism around the world is sending a strong 
signal that cannot be denied by cuba fidel castro must surely know 
his days in power are numbered 
the fall of romanian strongman nicolae ceausescu should send 
cold chills up the back of castro who stays in power on the back of 
a military force 
the people of the world are crying out for more freedom they 
want economic and social freedom they want a voice in determining 
the government under which they live 
modern technology has torn down the iron curtain satellite 
transmission of news the voice of america broadcasts and 
international travel to and from communist countries have told a 
story to warsaw pact nations that life can be better 
such is the case in castros cuba the day of censorship is 
over this information will be the downfall of castro 
there can be no timetable for those events because as long as 
castro can make the people of cuba believe evil things about 
americans his case is strong vigilance against capitalism 
communism has survived because the leaders were able to preach 
the fear of foreigners to those without other sources of 
information 
that day has come and gone and so will those who rule that way

1989 was a nightmare year for 
socialism but the ideology will prevail and citizens should rally 
around the communist party leadership official laotian radio said 
in an apparent reference to the upheaval in eastern europe the 
new years broadcast said capitalist countries had seized upon the 
difficulties in the socialist countries to try to dismantle the 
socialist system through ideological and political war 
in brief 1989 was a nightmare year for socialism of course 
all our people have been concerned with these developments said 
the broadcast a text of which was seen in bangkok wednesday 
nonetheless the lao people will never lose their faith in the 
socialist countries nor in their capabilities in finding a way out 
to overcome all difficulties it said 
as socialism came under attack in 1990 it is necessary that 
we strengthen and consolidate the national unity and unification 
under the banner of the party leadership the broadcast said 
laos also must continue its reforms strengthen its relations 
with communist allies vietnam cambodia and the soviet union and 
pay attention to internal security it said 
the communist party seized power in laos in december 1975

in 1620 a czech revolt against their austrian hapsburg rulers 
touched off the thirty years war a series of conflicts that swept 
through europe alexander dubceks daring but peaceful revolt in 
1968 against the worst constrictions of sovietstyle communism 
didnt have such a directly traceable longterm effect but the 
time memorialized by freedom lovers as the prague spring left an 
enduring legacy 
after 21 years of political exile as a virtual nonperson 
dubcek now 68 and widely revered for his earlier efforts at 
liberalization has been restored to power he was unanimously 
elected last week as the interim chairman of the czech parliament 
 
with their sad and ancient tradition of bad political news 
invariably followed by worse last weeks events were cause for 
about as much national joy as the czechs and slovaks ever dared 
indulge in with the political rebirth of dubcek and the election 
as temporary president of the popular vaclav havel the courageous 
playwright who has led the noncommunist opposition the fires of 
freedom are burning bright 
and this time as they enter a new year they once only dreamed 
of czechoslovakians seem determined to keep the precious flames

statesmanjournal salem ore on the alaskan oil spill 
the lasting effects of the exxon valdez oil spill now more than 
9 months old have sobering consequences for those who might have 
wished that the cleanup were over 
alaskan fishery authorities have continued to shut down 
commercial fisheries in the prince william sound because of renewed 
sightings of oil slicks they say the slicks would contaminate 
catches and fishing gear 
the latest fishery to be affected is the winter shrimp trawling 
season closed in december it normally would run through the 
winter but now will not reopen before feb 28 
the brown king crab fishery was canceled for the year other 
fisheries affected include salmon and herring 
most commercial fisheries in the area have been closed since the 
spill 
authorities say the oil apparently is bleeding into the sound 
from surrounding beaches 
the lesson that we keep being reminded of is that the ability of 
oil companies to deal with such large oil spills remains woefully 
inadequate

the durham nc sun on billy martin 
news of billy martins death in a onevehicle traffic accident 
caused shock throughout professional baseball just as his 
offthefield actions did many times during his 13 years as a 
manager 
few experts questioned martins managerial skills first 
nurtured while he played for casey stengel on five world 
championship teams with the new york yankees 
martin was a true yankee managing the team for controversial 
owner george steinbrenner five times he also managed the minnesota 
twins detroit tigers texas rangers and oakland athletics 
even though he often made the right moves from the dugout 
martins drinking and feisty nature cost him some jobs as manager 
his wellpublicized barroom brawls did however land him a 
starring role in a beer commercial 
although he was reaching the age 61 when many people think 
about retirement billy martin still was occasionally mentioned 
when major league teams were looking for new managers 
billy martin certainly will be missed in baseball it is 
unfortunate however that he too often will be remembered for his 
offthefield trouble instead of his good decisions as a manager 
and his true love of the game

peru which pulled out as a participant in an 
upcoming drug summit in colombia to protest the us invasion of 
panama has reversed course and will attend the conference 
american and peruvian officials said today 
peru had withdrawn from the feb 15 meeting where president bush 
and the presidents of the three andean nations peru colombia and 
bolivia were to discuss cooperation in the fight against drug 
production and trafficking 
it said it was doing so to protest president bushs dec 20 
invasion of panama with 14000 troops to oust gen manuel antonio 
noriega from power 
us officials said subsequently they had indications peru would 
change its mind on that decision 
peru indicates they intend to participate presidential 
press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters today although the 
word came through media rather than diplomatic channels 
fitzwater said however he did not know if perus president 
alan garcia would attend or whether he would send a lowerranking 
representative the meeting was designed as a meeting of the four 
presidents 
a peruvian diplomat in washington confirmed that peru had 
reversed itself but said it was not yet firm who would represent 
the south american nation 
the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said current 
plans are for a minister of foreign relations or minister of 
interior to attend 
if the united states withdraws its invasion troops from panama 
garcia may go the diplomat said 
the peruvian official said lima had reacted hastily in 
withdrawing its participation out of anger over the panama 
situation which has earned bush criticism from many nations 
in no way did peru want to boycott the meeting the official 
said sometimes you say things and then you realize it wasnt 
the proper thing to say 
peru is the worlds major producer of coca leaf while colombia 
is the leader in processing and exporting the plant for cocaine 
a us government team will travel to bolivia this month to meet 
with officials from the andean countries and work on agreement

a judge has ordered the city of new 
haven to provide shelter to all homeless people who request it 
saying connecticut cities have a legal obligation to do so that 
dates back three centuries 
superior court judge anthony demayo said courts in several other 
states including new york new jersey and california have issued 
similar righttoshelter rulings 
connecticut belongs in the ranks of those humane and 
progressive states which place human need ahead of budgetary 
concerns he wrote in an opinion issued last week 
an attorney for the city of new haven which was the target of a 
lawsuit that led to the decision said tuesday the city will appeal 
deputy corporation counsel edward mattison said no other 
righttoshelter order has been as farreaching and argued the 
ruling would hurt the citys efforts to provide a longterm 
solution to the homeless problem 
in his ruling demayo cited a summary of colonial laws compiled 
in 1672 stating that every town within this colony shall maintain 
their own poor 
earlier demayo had required new haven to open a new 50bed 
shelter to provide emergency housing for people unable to find 
space at the citys other shelters that order raises the number of 
available beds to 225 
the city tuesday said no one is being turned away now but that 
more space is likely to be needed later in the winter 
the state department of human resources estimates that there 
3000 to 5000 homeless in the state columbus house new havens 
main homeless shelter said 1200 different people stayed one or 
more nights there during the last year 
the ruling provides homeless people and their advocates good 
ammunition to get other connecticut municipalities to establish 
or expand shelters said amy epplerepstein an attorney for new 
haven legal assistance 
demayo gave the city of 125000 people 30 days to come up with a 
plan for implementing his order but left open the possibility he 
may narrow the scope of the injunction he said the citys plan 
could include charging some homeless people for shelter and 
limiting eligibility

the bush administration today deplored the 
killing of two nuns in nicaragua but said the leftist government in 
managua has failed to back up its charge that the attack was 
carried out by the usbacked contra rebels 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was not known who 
carried out the ambush monday night on a car carrying the roman 
catholic church workers on a highway in a remote northern section 
of the country 
two nuns one american the other nicaraguan were killed and 
a third was injured as was an americanborn nicaraguan bishop 
we deplore in the strongest terms this outrageous attack on 
religious workers and extend our deepest sympathy to the families 
of the victims this is a tragic incident one that further 
underscores the need to bring peace stability and democracy to 
nicaragua fitzwater told reporters 
the us embassy in nicaragua has been in contact with local 
church officials to obtain information including the sisters of 
saint agnes and the capuchin fathers he said 
we have no information on who was reponsible for this attack 
and we note that the church officials themselves have no 
information either fitzwater continued 
the nicaraguan government has provided no information to 
substantiate its charge that the contras launched the attack and 
we hope the sandinistas do not seek to obscure this tragedy by 
engaging in a propaganda battle 
fitzwater said the contras had condemned the attack and its 
military commander said the attack occurred outside of the contras 
usual operating area 
six jesuit priests were slain in el salvador recently a few days 
after leftist rebels launched an offensive against the government 
of alberto cristiani church groups have charged government 
security forces may have carried out those killings 
the nicaraguan government recently broke off a ceasefire with 
the rebels elections are scheduled in the country next month the 
first since the sandinistas toppled rightwing dictator anastasio 
samoza and came to power in 1979

the new government closed tv and 
radio stations linked to manuel antonio noriega and the vatican 
said today that noriega was being held in strict isolation in a 
room with a broken television set 
the bush administration said it would not rule out a 
thirdcountry destination for noriega although it prefers trying 
him in the united states 
a top us delegation led by deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger met with president guillermo endara and other leaders 
of panamas new government to begin planning american help for 
economic recovery 
the us embassy said eagleburger would look at ways to help 
panama recover from its economic decline which began largely when 
the united states imposed sanctions in its effort to drive noriega 
from power 
panamas economy was further battered by fighting during the 
american invasion and massive looting that followed 
acting treasury secretary john robson and mark edelman acting 
director of the us agency for international development 
accompanied eagleburger 
the embassy said the delegation also planned visits to a 
displaced persons camp the panama canal and to businesses trashed 
in the looting that followed the dec 20 invasion

daily briefing but he added we will not rule out any and every 
other kind of option

third country where he could be free from prosecution was no longer 
an acceptable option the united states had proposed as recently 
as october a variety of deals that would have allowed noriega to 
step down and go to a third country 
todays comments suggested that option was once again being 
considered 
endaras government on tuesday closed two television stations 
and 10 radio stations and declared them under state custody 
government spokesman edwin cabrera said the stations would be 
returned to their owners if their finances were in order 
one of the tv stations was owned by carlos duque who was 
noriegas presidential candidate in may 7 elections that noriega 
annulled when international observers said endara was ahead by a 
31 margin 
we dont intend to turn these mediums into propaganda machines 
while they are under investigation cabrera said 
he said the government also returned to its owners three 
newspaper shut down by noriega noriegas government had seized 
critica matutino and le republica and ran them for its own 
purposes 
ramon de lima the governments vice minister said the 
countrys press laws would be reviewed by the legislative assembly 
because they were instruments of oppression under noriega

the mission by himself but it has repeatedly said it would not 
hand him over to us troops

vatican mission and was hustled away by us troops encircling the 
twostory compond us embassy spokesmen said they had no 
explanation 
cubillas the vatican spokesman identified the man as juan 
carlos cabrera a cuban who had been living in the burnedout el 
chorrillo section of panama city he said the man became nervous 
because he had no identification documents and sought refuge in the 
vatican embassy

gave the maximum two stars to bush except edward h crane 
president of the libertarian cato institute who gave none

government delegates to talks with the 
opposition said wednesday that drastic action is necessary to 
rescue the east german economy which labors under a huge debt and 
severe shortage of skilled workers 
one opposition group threatened to quit the weekly negotiations 
the administration of communist premier hans modrow has 
recommended price increases for energy and removal of subsidies on 
food and other basic goods but rejects following poland in a 
radical turn toward market principles 
tensions have increased in recent weeks between modrows interim 
government and a fractious array of new political parties and 
reform groups as they try to reshape east germany and prepare for 
democratic elections in may 
opposition groups have accused modrows government of keeping 
important decisions secret during what they see as a transitional 
period 
forty years of communist mismanagement and the emigration to 
west germany last year of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers 
are being felt in a shortage of goods and decline in services 
labor shortages in health and other public services mean 
understaffed hospitals and littered streets the decline in 
industrial production that began last year is expected to continue 
through spring 
an opposition groups that seeks clarification of some issues 
threatened on wednesday to leave the weekly talks in which 
representatives of about 20 political parties and citizen groups 
are working on reforms 
democratic awakening a political group advocating closer ties 
with the west and a more marketoriented economy has demanded to 
know whether east germany still has a national security force and 
if so whether it is armed 
the government said last month the secret police agency was 
being disbanded on wednesday democratic awakening leader wolfgang 
schnur demanded evidence of that by monday 
new forum the largest reform movement with 200000 members had 
threatened earlier to pull out of the weekly negotiations 
at wednesdays session economics minister christa luft gave a 
grim account of east germanys condition 
more than 250000 job remain unfilled she said and the 
situation is particularly acute in health services education 
public works and factories 
in 1989 more than 320000 east germans fled to the freedom and 
greater prosperity of west germany where east germans are given 
generous aid and have little trouble integrating 
departures tapered off at the end of the year after the 
government ended travel restrictions nov 9 and embarked on a 
reform program but some officials fear renewed emigration if 
living conditions do not improve 
ms luft called for more private enterprise to meet the public 
demand for s restaurants electronics repair and other consumer 
services 
in the interest of economic effectiveness we must develop a 
proprietary consciousness and behavior in our population she 
said 
she said a law protecting the interests of foreign investors 
would be written to encourage more cooperation between west german 
and east german companies but i cannot imagine an investment 
cooperation policy on western terms 
invoking a central principle of communist ideology she rejected 
the concept of unemployment in east germany 
the nations foreign debt stands at 206 billion she said 
greater per capita than that of poland west german economists say 
however that east germanys economic condition is much better than 
that of poland or hungary two other soviet bloc nations pursuing 
reform 
in her argument to the negotiating group ms luft exhorted 
workers to produce more for export and avoid buying imported goods 
much of the foreign debt has resulted from imports of grain 
consumer goods and raw materials rather than for hightechnology 
equipment that could help rejuvenate industry she said 
wolfgang gress head of the government planning commission said 
higher prices for energy would encourage changes needed to reduce 
the burning of brown coal the major source of the pollution in 
east german cities 
he said 5 percent less coal would be made available in the first 
three months of this year 
such detailed reports on the economy as that given wednesday by 
ms luft were offered after new forum threatened to leave the 
talks new party chief gregor gysi and his no 2 man mayor 
wolfgang berghofer of dresden represent the communists in the 
negotiations

a us magistrate refused bond 
wednesday to a longsought bolivian colonel who allegedly once 
vowed to cover americans in cocaine 
an innocent plea and request for a jury trial were entered for 
luis arce gomez dubbed bolivias minister of cocaine on 1983 
charges of conspiracy to import and conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine 
magistrate lurana snow found probable cause that arce gomez 
seized by bolivian authorities and turned over to the united states 
on dec 10 was a danger to the community and a risk to flee 
the magistrate noted that the us government had been actively 
seeking arce gomezs extradition since 1983 
attorneys disclosed that a colombian codefendant has pleaded 
guilty to one of the two counts of cocaine conspiracy ana 
rodriguez de tamayo who was extradited last october pleaded 
guilty tuesday a second conspiracy count was dropped but michael 
patrick sullivan an assistant us attorney refused to discuss 
the plea or whether she will testify against arce gomez 
the magistrate set a feb 14 status conference 
arce gomez who is being held at the federal metropolitan 
correctional center listened to the proceedings through an 
interpreter 
prosecutors didnt present witnesses but cited four affidavits 
used in earlier efforts to extradite arce gomez 
an affidavit from john patrick raftery a drug enforcement 
administration special agent said arce gomez was involved in 
conspiracy to import hundreds of pounds of cocaine into the united 
states as bolivias minister of interior from july 1980 to march 
1981 the affidavit said arce gomez directed operations in which 
he collected protection money from cocaine traffickers 
a special security service he formed would seize cocaine from 
traffickers who were not paying for protection and deliver it to 
traffickers who were paying for protection the affidavit said 
on one shipment of 374 pounds of cocaine arce gomez charged 
13 million the affidavit said 
two admitted participants in cocaine trafficking bolivian 
citizens enrique atala zabala and sonia sanjanez de atala said 
arce gomez told them he was involved in cocaine trafficking because 
the government was in a difficult economic situation arce gomez 
blamed the united states for cutting off aid 
arce gomez stated that because the gringos liked cocaine 
the gringos ought to take care of their borders because he was 
going to cover them in cocaine atala zabala said in his 
affidavit 
us officials led by president bush hailed bolivias decision 
to allow arce gomez to be prosecuted in the united states although 
some bolivian politicians were critical of his extradition 
if convicted he faces up to 30 years in us prison 
arce gomez was one of 18 people named in the april 1983 
indictment three of the people pleaded guilty and two others were 
convicted eleven are still fugitives

nearly onefourth of the justice departments 
organized crime prosecutors have quit since attorney general dick 
thornburgh announced plans to put their extraordinarily successful 
strike forces under the control of local us attorneys 
after a year of controversy and discontent in congress 
thornburgh on monday imposed the change he has been seeking for 15 
years 
veterans of the justice departments twodecade allout attack 
on la cosa nostra predict that even more of their colleagues will 
quit now that hopes of blocking the move have been dashed so far 
33 have left 
people are voting with their feet said jeremiah osullivan 
who headed the boston strike force for 10 years and left for 
private practice this year after serving briefly as us attorney 
there there will be a larger turnover immediately after the 
merger especially of the key experienced people 
since 1980 the strike forces have convicted mob leaders long 
thought untouchable in boston brooklyn cleveland chicago 
denver kansas city los angeles new haven conn new orleans 
philadelphia and rochester ny 
until now they reported directly to the organized crime and 
racketeering section of the departments criminal division in 
washington onehundred fifteen career government prosecutors in 
the strike forces now will become assistants to the us attorneys 
who are political appointees of the president twenty more based in 
washington would handle emergency assignments 
thornburgh predicts substantial management benefits because 
there will no longer be two separate federal prosecutors in the 
same jurisdiction 
he also says the move is needed because the strike forces have 
been slow to respond to new organized crime elements such as the 
colombian drug cartels asian groups street gangs such as the 
crips and bloods and the jamaican posses 
thornburgh first proposed such a merger in 1974 at the time as 
us attorney in pittsburgh he was battling with his local strike 
force chief and headed a committee of us attorneys who studied 
the issue 
in acting monday thornburgh spurned a lastminute appeal by 
senate judiciary chairman joseph r biden to hold up the 
reorganization 
many strike force veterans dispute the attorney generals claim 
of increased efficiency 
peter vaira who headed strike forces in chicago and 
philadelphia and was us attorney in philadelphia for five years 
predicts they will have atrophied within three years as us 
attorneys pursue only shortterm fastresult cases 
few of the 93 us attorneys stay more than four years in the 
job many leave to pursue their own political careers 
it has sometimes taken decades to bring about the remarkable 
successes that have been accomplished a us attorney cannot wait 
for even two or three years for results said harvard law 
professor philip b heymann who was criminal division chief in the 
carter administration 
the strike forces have spent decades tracking crime families and 
alliances across state lines osullivan spent 10 years in boston 
edward mcdonald headed the brooklyn program for seven years and 
joel friedman directed operations in philadelphia for 14 years 
assistant attorney general edward dennis head of the criminal 
division told a house subcommittee there is simply no reason to 
anticipate that attrition would be any greater than usual 
under thornburghs plan 
but david margolis head of justices organized crime section 
since 1979 warned in 1987 that many senior prosecutors would leave 
under a merger 
in fact since thornburgh unveiled his plan in midfebruary 33 
strike force attorneys have quit in the equivalent period prior to 
midfebruary only nine left department figures show 
asked about the losses thornburghs spokesman dave runkel said 
it tells you more about the people whove been involved in those 
offices than it does about the merger if these people were truly 
committed to that fight they would have no reason to abandon ship 
osullivan disagreed these people worked for years for 7000 
to 10000 a year less in salary than assistant us attorneys with 
half their experience thats the definition of dedication 
the department is losing experienced lawyers like osullivan 
who recognized oblique references on a taped conversation in 1981 
to three murders that had occurred in the 1960s the evidence 
became part of an indictment that brought down the hierarchy of the 
boston mob 
a thornburgh backer us attorney andrew maloney in brooklyn 
scoffs at the idea that this expertise is irreplacable fbi 
agents and other federal investigators are supposed to be the 
experts he said 
but john good the fbi agent who developed the abscam bribery 
investigation of congress said the most important factor is having 
an experienced prosecutor available for complicated cases 
good took abscam to the brooklyn strike force chief hed known 
for 12 years rather than to the us attorney even though it was 
not an organized crime case 
traditionally assistant us attorneys were there to get 
their tickets punched put two or three years in make a connection 
and get out and get with a major law firm good said 
the brooklyn strike force has been hit especially hard by 
resignations in the past year 11 of the 15 members have departed 
including mcdonald 
and the brooklyn strike force was among the most productive in 
the nation since 1980 it convicted six bosses of the colombo and 
bonnano families more than 65 other mobsters more than 50 union 
officials eight congressmen including the abscam defendants more 
than 200 businessmen and a host of local officials fines 
forfeitures and restitutions have totaled more than 200 million 
late last year thornburgh himself said that until the 
mid1960s the mob was run by men in the prime of life but today 
the seasoned upper and middlemanagement of this structure has 
been devastated by the governments continuous attack

over the last 22 years the organized crime 
strike forces of the justice department accomplished what had once 
seemed impossible they broke la cosa nostras code of silence and 
sent its leaders to prison 
the idea began in january 1967 in buffalo where the 
departments organized crime and racketeering section established 
its first field office a team of attorneys and agents from various 
federal investigative agencies mounted a coordinated attack 
identifying the local organized crime power structure and targeting 
its most crucial players for prosecution 
by november 1968 more than 30 people had been indicted 
the success was so obvious that attorney general ramsey clark 
decided later that year to deploy 19 strike forces around the 
country 
slowly working with a single focus from one office in 
washington they accomplished things never before thought possible 
using an idea once employed against prohibition mobster al capone 
who was sent to prison on tax charges they drew on every federal 
investigative agency the fbi irs drug agencies the labor 
department postal inspectors and others on the theory that the 
mob broke many laws and conviction on any one could help disrupt 
its activities 
they learned how to move from the bottom of an organization to 
the top and break the mobsters code of silence by developing 
turncoats along the way finally prosecuting mob leaders long 
thought beyond the reach of the law they learned how to use new 
legislation authorizing electronic surveillance and allowing the 
seizure of illgotten assets 
they shepherded the fbis entry into undercover work and 
mastered laws like rico the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations act under which whole crime families could be 
prosecuted 
they undertook to purge organized crime from entire legitimate 
industries it had infiltrated 
they won the trust of many federal investigators who brought 
them even nonorganized crime cases like the abscam bribery case 
involving members of congress they fought off attacks in 1974 
1976 and 1987 from us attorneys who wanted control over their 
operations 
since 1980 the strike forces have convicted the boss and top 
henchmen of two crime families in brooklyn as well as the 
leadership of the boston mob the massachusetts and connecticut 
branches of the genovese family the philadelphia mob the 
rochester family the cleveland mob the kansas city family the 
denver family 
in addition they convicted two successive hierarchies of the 
los angeles mob the new orleans boss twice and the chicago family 
boss 
others indicted include the nations largest pornographer the 
leading colombian drug kingpin pablo escobar two teamster union 
presidents one of whom became an informant after conviction a 
host of union officers local officials and policmen contractors 
and union officials who rigged bids on the renovation of new yorks 
shea stadium banks and brokerage houses that moved mob money and 
even mobsters who got a payoff written into the contract to move an 
fbi office 
cases spanned the country pendorf a las vegas casino skimming 
prosecution began in kansas city and involved electronic 
surveillance in illinois missouri kansas and wisconsin organized 
crime leaders from chicago milwaukee cleveland las vegas and 
kansas city were convicted 
before attorney general dick thornburgh placed them under us 
attorneys the 14 strike forces were located in boston brooklyn 
buffalo chicago cleveland detroit kansas city las vegas los 
angeles miami newark new orleans philadelphia and san francisco 
they had 11 suboffices in new haven conn providence ri 
rochester ny syracuse ny milwaukee atlanta fort

a federal judge gave a lastchance warning to 
those involved in a voter discrimination lawsuit against los 
angeles county saying he will not allow any outofcourt 
settlement once the trial begins 
the lawsuit charges that the county prevented a hispanic from 
being elected to the board of supervisors by unfairly distributing 
the countys huge hispanic population across several voter 
districts 
opening arguments were scheduled to start today in the lawsuit 
brought by the us justice department and two civil rights groups 
a victory by the plaintiffs would result in a redrawing of the 
countys districts 
abraham lincoln never split a rail as cleanly as the 1981 
supervisorial district boundaries divide the hispanic community 
said papers filed tuesday by the justice department 
as late as tuesday the board voted 32 against a proposal to 
convert the fivemember body to seven members a move that could 
have revived settlement talks and stalled the trial 
once the trial begins it will proceed until the court renders 
its ruling us district judge david v kenyon said tuesday 
during the trial the court will not entertain or accept any 
settlement discussion or agreement 
the lawsuit claims the board of supervisors divided the countys 
hispanics among three districts in 1981 to dilute their voting 
power in violation of the us voting rights act 
although hispanics make up at least 27 percent of the countys 
85 million residents a hispanic has never been elected to the 
board 
the two sides appeared close to a settlement last month when the 
board of supervisors agreed to redraw a supervisors district to 
raise the number of hispanic voters in the area but the compromise 
collapsed

chinas education minister has said that 
ideological training must be stepped up in the nations schools to 
stave off the corrosive influence of western ideas a newspaper 
said wednesday 
li tieying head of the state education commission also said 
unstable factors still exist on university campuses due to 
years of shortcomings in ideological education the peoples daily 
reported 
li in a report on future educational goals delivered to the 
national legislature emphasized that the sharp increase in 
political education since the june crackdown on the studentled 
prodemocracy movement has not gone far enough 
at the present time the tendency to not pay attention to moral 
education is fairly prominent ideological education is weak 
administration is lax schools especially institutions of higher 
learning have to varying degrees received the corrosive influence 
of bourgeois liberalization and the situation is fairly serious 
chinese authorities say students and others who joined the 
spring democracy movement were blinded by bourgeois liberalization 
or attraction to western ideas and customs 
since june students have been required to take extensive 
classes in political dogma and participate in workstudy programs 
on farms or factories the entire freshman class at beijing 
university a center for student activism last spring was sent to 
a neighboring province for a year of military training 
li said that as a result of the communist partys warm loving 
care and strict demands the atmosphere on campus is 
comparatively stable but he said the problems are deeprooted 
and will require a long period of hard work to overcome 
despite the governments bloody suppression of dissent and heavy 
indoctrination policies students privately continue to advocate 
democratic reform in china and speak with envy of reforms taking 
place in east europe 
beijing security forces reportedly increased vigilance around 
campuses following the overthrow of the hardline communist regime 
of nicolae ceausescu in romania which students marked with parties 
and a few furtive attempts to put up antigovernment posters 
among lis recommendations were for communist party 
organizations to play an increased role on campuses particularly 
in providing ideological guidance to teachers 
schools he said must vigorously resolve problems regarding 
certain philosophy and social science directions that are not clear 
and problems of deviation from marxist guidance 
schools should strengthen workstudy programs and draw up 
appropriate rules to govern the physical and mental health of 
students he said 
li said chinas student exchange programs with foreign countries 
will continue and gradually expand but students selected for 
academic work abroad generally will be in frontline work or 
those who have superior political and vocational credentials 
the government effectively has stopped sending undergraduates 
and graduate students abroad exacted heavy fees on those wishing 
to study overseas at private expense and imposed stringent 
regulations on people seeking leave from jobs to go abroad 
i want to especially point out that those students sent abroad 
to study must return and serve the country li said 
he referred to a current dispute with the united states which 
is allowing chinese students fearing persecution at home to extend 
their us stays even before june large numbers of chinese 
students were failing to return home after their programs ended

a woman extradited from austria where she 
allegedly lived in luxury will remain in jail without bond to face 
charges she operated an international marijuanasmuggling ring a 
judge has ruled 
linda l leary 58 former president of the indianapolis league 
of women voters and the local chapter of the national council of 
jewish women might try to flee before her feb 13 trial if bail 
were granted us district judge larry j mckinney said tuesday 
mckinney said testimony from investigators showed that leary and 
her sons had moved to austria to escape us jurisdiction 
his decision overturned a federal magistrates ruling allowing 
bond for leary that ruling had been stayed pending prosecutors 
appeal to mckinney and leary was never released 
leary and her sons paul heilbrunn 35 and richard heilbrunn 
38 were among 34 people indicted in 1987 on charges of allegedly 
operating a marijuanasmuggling ring that allegedly shipped at 
least 250000 pounds of the drug to this country 
leary and her sons were arrested in may in austria where she 
had been living since november 1985 and were extradited to indiana 
last month 
they were living luxurious lifestyles when they were arrested 
authorities said paul heilbrunn lived in a hillside home with a 
lake view while his mother and brother lived in a threelevel 
secluded home in salzburg

austrian house and invested more than 300000 in a business there 
after the three were returned to indianapolis us magistrate 
john p godich ordered the heilbrunns held pending trial however 
he said leary could be released on a 200000 property bond because 
of blood pressure problems that her attorney claimed couldnt be 
properly treated in jail

condition couldnt be treated in jail 
leary faces 12 counts including conspiracy to distribute 
marijuana moneylaundering and interstate transportation in aid of 
racketeering she could be sentenced to 30 years in prison

state radio and a major black 
newspaper on wednesday hailed the lack of racial conflict on newly 
integrated beaches that drew huge holiday crowds 
police in durban and cape town the two largest summer vacation 
destinations said there had been no serious racial incidents 
during the long new years weekend despite the opening of the last 
whitesonly beaches on the orders of president fw de klerk 
what this demonstrates is that the skies will not fall when 
insulting petty apartheid laws are dropped said the sowetan the 
largestselling blackoriented daily the countrys economy will 
improve there will be a feeling of hope among south africas 
people 
it said beach segregation was a monstrous act of expensive 
racism 
cape town police reported one shooting incident at a beachfront 
parking lot and durban police said there were 53 arrests at local 
beaches from friday through tuesday a black man was fatally 
stabbed in a fight and a policeman suffered a knife wound in 
another incident in durban but the sowetan said police there 
showed considerable restraint despite occasional taunting from 
blacks on the beaches 
the loudest criticism of beach integration came from the 
farright conservative party which said the government was 
destroying white community life 
koos van der merwe the partys chief spokesman said beaches 
had been littered and civilized standards disregarded during a 
weekend in which beaches had been swamped by blacks 
provincial affairs minister hermanus kriel rejected van der 
merwes criticisms saying it was unjust and racist to blame 
only blacks for problems at the beaches he said the national party 
government would assist local authorities in improving seaside 
facilities to accommodate larger crowds 
hotel owners around durban said their facilities were as full as 
in previous years despite predictions that some whites from inland 
areas would stay away 
authorities said about 150000 people more than 90 percent of 
them black packed durbans beachfront on new years day mayor 
derrick waterson said nothing abnormal occurred 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp said in a 
commentary the abolition of beach segregation has succeeded 
beyond the hopes of even the most sanguine 
among the hundreds of thousands who flocked to natal and cape 
beaches over the christmas and new years weekends not one 
incident of racial confrontation of any note was reported the 
sabc said the incident free holidaymaking reflects the 
extent to which the last decades reforms has fostered attitudes of 
mutual acceptance among the countrys diverse communities

the sovietiranian border zone played a key role 
in cold war history when the west forced josef stalin to abandon 
his efforts to create a puppet state in northern iran 
members of the azerbaijani ethnic group a turkic people live 
on both sides of the frontier and are predominantly shiite moslems 
like most people in iran 
more than 7 million people live in the soviet republic of 
azerbaijan on the caspian sea more than 4 million ethnic 
azerbaijanis live in the adjoining province of northern iran also 
called azerbaijan 
the red army moved into northern iran in 1941 during the first 
year of soviet fighting in world war ii the soviets signed a 
treaty in 1942 along with britain and persia as iran was then 
called agreeing to respect the territorial integrity 
sovereignty and political independence of persia the soviets did 
not observe it 
the british withdrew from iran as agreed within six months of 
the end of hostilities with nazi germany in 1945 but the soviets 
remained they demanded oil concessions and under the aegis of the 
red army set up an independent azerbaijan republic in northern iran 
in december 1945 in march 1946 the soviets also created a kurdish 
republic in iran 
but reaction from the western powers the un security council 
and the iranian government was firm and by may 1946 the soviet 
forces withdrew 
the episode is widely seen as having convinced president harry 
s truman that stalin would back down if resisted in 1947 he 
announced what became known as the truman doctrine which 
proclaimed that further soviet territorial expansion would be 
actively resisted 
despite their withdrawal from northern iran the soviets 
continued to exert influence through the persian communist party 
kurdish separatists and an azerbaijani democratic movement 
effectively keeping the persians out of the area until december 
1946

the bush administration said today it would 
not rule out a thirdcountry destination for ousted panamanian 
dictator manuel antonio noriega although it strongly prefers 
trying him in the united states 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater denied that the 
administration was moving away from its position that noriega 
should be brought to the united states to face drugtrafficking 
charges 
i want to make clear from this podium our positon is we want 
him returned to the united staes fitzwater told reporters at his 
daily briefing but he added we will not rule out any and every 
other kind of option 
meanwhile the pentagon announced that about 500 members of the 
armys 1st battalion 75th ranger regiment would return to their 
home base at hunter army airfield in savannah ga late today from 
panama 
the unit was among more than 11000 troops dispatched from us 
bases for the dec 20 invasion that ousted noriega from power 
soldiers from the 7th infantry division had returned to fort ord 
calif earlier 
last saturday bush suggested that allowing noriega to go to a 
third country where he could be free from prosecution was no longer 
an acceptable option the united states had proposed as recently 
as last october a variety of deals that would have allowed noriega 
to step down and go to a third country 
the death of one marine the brutalization of a wife of a 
lieutenant the death of a lot of our kids thats what changed 
and thats why i feel very strongly that were not back to square 
one bush had said 
but today fitzwater said weve never said no third country 
what we have said is we want him to come back to the united states 
but we are not going to rule out every other alternative 
later fitzwater said i did not want to imply any change our 
position is that we want him returned to the united states for 
prosecution there is absolutely no change in our position 
the administration and the vatican remained at odds on noriegas 
fate with the vatican so far showing little interest in turning 
the deposed leader over to us forces 
fitzwater asked about reports that the vatican would only 
release noriega if he could be guaranteed a fair trial and that his 
life would not be in danger said he will receive a fair trial in 
this country 
furthermore the spokesman said under terms of the 
indictments he is not subject to capital punishment 
in a related development american and peruvian officials said 
today that peru which pulled out as a participant in an upcoming 
drug summit in colombia to protest the us invasion of panama has 
reversed course and will attend the conference 
meanwhile the envoy designated by panamanian president 
guillermo endara as ambassador to the organization of american 
states presented his credentials today to oas officials in 
washingtion even though he was initially rebuffed by the oas 
as of tuesday 11 governments have officially recognized the 
endara government and 24 others have indicated acceptance by 
establishing contact with the foreign ministry the state 
department said 
endaras choice as oas ambassador is lawrence chewning fabrega 
a career diplomat who broke with noriega a week after noriega was 
indicted by two florida grand juries on drug trafficking charges in 
february 1988 
the envoy had been attached to panamas oas mission at the time 
and has lived in the united states in exile since then taking part 
in the antinoriega struggle 
his tenure as oas ambassador got off to a rocky start the envoy 
who served under noriega was allowed to assume panamas seat when 
the oas took up the panama question hours after the invasion began 
after marathon debate the oas voted 201 to express regret over 
the us action 
among the countries which have announced recognition of the new 
panamanian government or shown acceptance in other ways are great 
britain luxembourg dominica barbados spain the philippines and 
guatemala chewning fabrega said 
meanwhile a special oas session is scheduled for friday to hear 
a nicaraguan complaint about the search by us troops last friday 
of the residence of the nicaraguan ambassador to panama 
president bush said the incident was the result of a mistake 
nicaragua retaliated by expelling 20 us diplomats from managua 
on tuesday deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger was 
sent to panama for talks with endara on ways for the united states 
to help recovery from two years of steep economic decline 
also the white house announced on tuesday the appointment of 
career diplomat deane hinton as ambassador to panama hinton 66 a 
leading state department expert on central america currently 
serves as ambassador to costa rica and also was former president

south koreas unification minister has 
declared an era of exchange in its relations with north korea 
urging the communist nation to open economic and nonpolitical 
cooperation on the divided peninsula 
the year 1990 will be an era of exchange unification 
minister lee hongkoo said in an interview with yonhap the south 
korean news agency published wednesday 
he said south korea will seek active dialogue with north korea 
and that a government fund would be set up to expedite economic 
cooperation and other exchanges he said the fund would be 
subsidized by private business groups anxious to initiate trade and 
investment with north korea 
lee was skeptical about any immediate change in north korea 
under the unchallenged leadership of president kim il sung and said 
nonpolitical exchanges must precede politics to end decadeslong 
distrust between the two rivals 
he said south koreas basic unification policy was aimed at 
gradual disarmament after signing a peace treaty with north korea 
talks on arms reduction must be held after the two koreas declare 
a nonaggression pact he said 
south koreans would be allowed gradually to watch north korean 
television and read the communist party newspaper lee said some 
north korean tv programming already is available in south korea 
in a new years speech kim proposed talks on breaking down a 
concrete border wall to ensure free travel between the nations 
reiterating a call for a conference that would include leaders of 
seouls government and opposition parties 
kim said he was ready to remove barbed wires which mark a 
boundary contending no border barrier exists on the north korean 
side 
a south korean government statement called kims proposal 
empty propaganda intended to avoid international and internal 
pressure to open pyongyangs closed society 
there is no concrete barrier in our area south of the 
demarcation line said a south korean government statement it 
said kims new year call was intended to dilute our initiatives 
in unification talks 
north korea invaded south korea in 1950 triggering a threeyear 
war and a peace treaty was never signed 
they are separated by the 2milewide demilitarized zone under 
a 1953 armistice but the border on both sides is sealed by 
concrete bunkers mine fields barbed wires and heavily armed 
soldiers 
outside the dmz and on roads leading to it south korea has 
built up roadblocks concrete walls and other obstacles to guard 
against surprise attacks 
north korea pushed for military talks with south korea last 
year but seoul claims people political and cultural exchange 
talks must be held before military discussions little progress has 
been made in the talks with each side insisting on its own 
proposals 
seoul officials believe north korea has never given up its 
intention to communize south korea and that its proposals have been 
aimed at inciting unrest and forcing the withdrawal of 43000 us 
forces stationed in south korea

a company has come up with the ultimate last 
call for people whose idea of heaven is a cozy english pub 
for 8000 customers can have their ashes rest under their 
favorite stools or beneath the bar where they bent their elbows and 
be toasted every year as a notquiteabsent friend 
instead of being stuck in a cold graveyard in a cemetery where 
few people visit the deceased will be surrounded by friends who 
will have a permanent reminder of the good times they enjoyed 
says colm orourke owner of the little pub co 
brewers society spokesman mike ripley said he doubted anyone 
would ever be buried in a pub 
its a very silly story ripley said i suspect the idea 
was thought up at 1155 on new years eve and if someone had told 
me tomorrow was april first i wouldnt be at all surprised 
the home office which regulates burials said there were no 
regulations prohibiting ashes being buried in pubs unless the 
corpse is already buried exhumations are not allowed 
the little pub co is offering eternal rest at the pack horse 
the little tumbling sailor or any of the other of its 10 pubs in 
western england said the companys attorney jack haywood 
haywood describes orourke as an irish millionaire whos 
completely barmy with these weird and wonderful pubs 
orourke 39 wants his ashes buried in the pack horse in his 
home village of bewdley in worcestershire 95 miles northwest of 
london 
i am going to be buried in one of our larger pubs since im a 
big guy said haywood who has selected the pie factory pub in 
tipton since my wife always finds me there she will be used to 
visiting me there 
the plan was born haywood admitted when wed had far too 
much to drink 
at the white lion in cradley heath 100 miles northwest of 
london manager brian robinson said several regulars told him they 
wanted to be buried amid the pints and the pub grub 
robinson said interest centered on a spot directly in front of 
the pubs best brew lumphammer bitter 
sam mccormack operations manager at the little pub co 
headquarters in kidderminster said the plan was indirectly 
inspired by the death of a customer at the pack horse 
we were holding a retirement party for him mrs mccormack 
said the man went home to change and didnt come back everyone 
was very upset 
the brass plaque erected in his memory inspired the ashes 
scheme mrs mccormack said 
dead customers could be accommodated anywhere in the pub 
haywood said the fee would include an urn a brass plaque and the 
annual wake 
why not give people the chance once theyre cremated to be put 
in a block behind the bar as opposed to being scattered over a golf 
course haywood said 
my family would certainly come and visit me robinson said 
if i were buried in a pub

the white house said wednesday that female 
soldiers served with great distinction in the us invasion of 
panama including a captain of military police who led her platoon 
against armed panamanian defense forces 
three pdf soldiers were killed in that battle led by army capt 
linda l bray commander of the 988th military police company 
us law and army regulations prohibit women from serving in 
jobs designated as combat roles by the military 
but women now make up 11 percent of the us military and as 
their numbers have grown so have their responsibilities 
brays company had been sent to panama from fort benning ga 
on a regular rotation a week before the dec 20 invasion that 
toppled dictator manuel antonio noriega 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked if the pentagon 
had expected female soldiers to get into the fighting said 
the women have been carrying out important functions within 
the military now for some time those responsibilities are well 
established and laid out by their training and assignments we 
think they performed with great distinction 
when a reporter suggested that the heavilyguarded attackdog 
kennel that brays company took out was not a very difficult 
target fitzwater snapped 
its unfair to belittle the action by referring to this as dog 
kennels it was heavily defended three pdf men were killed 
gunshots were fired on both sides american troops could have been 
killed he said 
it was an important military operation a woman led it and she 
did an outstanding job and the fact is that role has been 
anticipated from the first day she was given that assignment the 
presidential spokesman said 
none of the 23 us soldiers killed in the panama invasion were 
women the pentagon says of the 24500 troops and officers involved 
in the operation 600 were women including 170 from units flown 
in for the invasion and 430 already station in panama 
women served not only in the military police but in support 
roles for the infantry intelligence units a signal battalion and 
the headquarters of the 18th airborne corps four women provided 
support services for special operations teams involved in some of 
the heaviest fighting 
fitzwater said these women soldiers have been in those roles 
for some time they werent just put into them the first day of 
the panama invasion 
rep pat schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on military installations said wednesday she 
will introduce legislation when congress reconvenes to allow army 
women to enter all military specialities including combat for a 
fouryear test period a defense advisory committee recently 
recommended such a move 
schroeder said in an interview that brays experience showed 
how silly the whole combat exclusion is theres no such thing as 
being excluded from combat when youre in a panamatype of 
situation 
had the army known the kennel was going to be heavily defended 
they would have sent in an armored unit not a company of 
mps she said 
but in a battle zone like panama she said everything could 
be combat

first lady barbara bush underwent on wednesday 
the first of 10 daily radiation treatments in a new medical effort 
to control the effects of graves disease an immune system ailment 
that earlier attacked her thyroid gland 
mrs bush spent three hours at walter reed army medical center 
and then returned to the white house only 10 minutes of the 
hospital visit were actually spent in radiation therapy a 
spokeswoman said 
after returning from walter reed the 64yearold first lady 
went for her customary onemile swim in the white house outdoor 
pool 
she said it was like a trip to the dentist only better said 
mrs bushs press secretary anna perez 
doctors plan to use brief lowlevel radiation treatments daily 
for the next nine days on mrs bush in hopes of halting a swelling 
in the small muscles that control movements of the eyes 
medical experts not associated with the case said that such 
treatment is routine for graves disease eye patients who have not 
responded to other therapy the radiation treatment is not 
considered dangerous and has a high rate of success say the 
experts 
the published studies report 60 to 90 percent of patients have 
a favorable response to this treatement said dr joshua cohen 
an endocrinology specialist at george washington university medical 
center in general the response is very good 
dr david cooper chief of endrocrinology at sinai hospital in 
baltimore and an associate professor of medicine at johns hopkins 
university said that radiation treatment of the eye effects of 
graves disease is a fairly routine sort of thing theres a very 
high success rate over 80 percent 
cooper said the radiation dose used is very low and rarely 
causes any side effects such as nausea or hair loss that are common 
side effects from the powerful radiation doses used in cancer 
therapy 
dr richard c eastman chief of endocrinology at georgetown 
hospital said that some rare patients develop cateracts 
cateracts are a concern any time you use radiation on the 
eye he said 
a white house statement said the radiation treatments will not 
prevent mrs bush from carrying out her normal schedule 
doctors first diagnosed graves disease last year after mrs 
bush experienced weight loss and other symptoms of an overactive 
thyroid she underwent treatment with drugs and with radioactive 
iodine to destroy or disable her flawed thyroid gland but the 
treatment apparently did not cure the inflamation of muscles in the 
eye a common symptom of graves disease 
uncorrected the eye condition can lead to blindness in a small 
percentage of patients but cooper said that generally the eye 
ailment caused by graves disease is mild and selflimiting 
graves disease named for a 19th century irish physician who 
first described it is caused when the bodys immune system starts 
attacking the parts of the body itself 
the primary targets are cells in the thyroid gland and in the 
small muscles back of the eyeball that control the matched movement 
of the eyes just why these two dissimilar organs are attacked are 
unknown 
we dont really know what causes graves disease said 
eastman we do know that theres a genetic predisposition and 
that women are more apt to get the disease than men stress has 
been implicated as a trigger for the disease but we really dont 
know why 
typically patients with graves experience an increase in 
thyroid hormone secretion this leads to a higher metabolic rate a 
loss of weight and sometimes changes in the heart beat doctors 
correct this problem by disabling or destroying the thyroid with 
steroids or with radiation therpy 
mrs bush underwent this treatment in april 
but patients quite often said the experts continue to 
experience an autoimmune inflamation of the eye muscles 
eventually the eyes stop tracking properly and the patient can 
develop double vision 
a white house spokesperson said earlier that mrs bush was 
seeing double 
she was treated with prednisone a powerful steroid that often 
controls the condition when this failed cohen said the usual next 
step is radiation 
should the radiation fail surgery would be indicated said 
cohen to relieve the pressure in the eye socket or to reattach 
malfunctioning muscles such treatment may require a series of 
operations but cohen said that surgery is only needed for only a 
very few graves disease patients

some of the best longtermcare insurance 
policies on the market in 1988 provided inadequate protection 
against the staggering costs of nursing home care according to a 
private study released wednesday 
the study supported by a grant from the american association of 
retired persons analyzed policies offered by 11 leading companies 
and concluded that many failed to achieve the basic purpose for 
which they were bought 
many of them failed to provide much protection against the 
uncertainty of paying high outofpocket costs for nursing home 
care the study said 
private insurance coverage for nursing home costs was virtually 
nonexistent until the 1980s but the market has grown rapidly in 
recent years 
more than 100 companies now offer longtermcare insurance and 
more than 13 million policies had been purchased by mid1989 
according to the health insurance association of america 
association spokesman richard coorsh said hiaa had not seen the 
aarp report and had no immediate comment 
the aarp report found wide variations and coverage options among 
the policies studied and said it was difficult to determine how 
companies would interpret the restrictions in their policies 
leaving a great deal of uncertainty over how much of nursing 
home costs would be covered 
applying both strict and lenient interpretations to each policy 
analyzed the study found that the policies might reduce 
outofpocket spending on nursing homes by anywhere from 121 
percent to 626 percent 
even if a person buys the most generous policy he or she 
faces a great deal of uncertainty about how much the policy will 
pay the study said 
the cost of nursing home care averages about 2000 a month an 
estimated 40 percent of all elderly people will spend some time in 
a nursing home before their death with half of all stays lasting 
six months or less and the other half averaging 25 years 
according to hiaa 
the aarp report analyzed policies marketed from may through july 
of 1988 and acknowledged that there have been subsequent 
improvements in many longtermcare policies the study was 
conducted by thomas rice and kathleen thomas of the university of 
north carolina and william weissert of the university of michigan 
the researchers said most of the policies studied substantially 
reduced expected payments by denying benefits to people who went 
into nursing homes without first being hospitalized and by 
providing benefits only for those people requiring skilled nursing 
home care 
the findings confirm the wisdom of a december 1988 
recommendation by the national association of insurance 
commissioners that states prohibit the sale of policies with prior 
hospitalization or levelofcare requirements the study said 
it said two other problem areas that need to be addressed are 
the lack of inflation adjustments in policies and limits on the 
length of coverage for nursing home stays 
the report recommended that the naic expand its model 
regulations to require that policies cover at least four years in a 
nursing home and offer some form of inflation protection 
provisions such as these will raise premiums but will 
substantially reduce the uncertainty faced by individuals who 
purchase policies and subsequently receive care in a nursing 
home it said

japan may send a representative to 
cambodia for the first time since the indochina war ended in 1975 
and wants a greater role in seeking peace there a japanese foreign 
ministry spokesman said wednesday 
seiichi kondo the spokesman was reporting on a meeting earlier 
in the day between prime minister chatichai choonhavan and the 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama who arrived tuesday for 
an official visit 
the japanese government is seriously considering the 
possibility of dispatching a foreign ministry official to phnom 
penh to get firsthand information on the situation of cambodia 
kondo told a news conference 
siddhi savetsila the thai foreign minister said senior 
officials of the association of southeast asian nations planned to 
meet soon to discuss peace proposals for cambodia put forth the 
united states australia and thailand 
kondo said a senior japanese foreign ministry official sakutaro 
tanino was to meet thursday in bangkok with michael costello 
deputy foreign secretary of australia to discuss australian 
suggestions 
last month british government officials visited cambodia to 
assess development needs britain was the first western country to 
accept vietnams assertion that it had withdrawn its troops from 
cambodia at the end of september after nearly 11 years of 
occupation 
on wednesday kondo said japan wanted to send someone to phnom 
penh as soon as possible but no date had been set japanese 
officials said privately that masaharu kohno a southeast asia 
specialist at the foreign ministry probably would make the trip in 
february 
japan and many other governments withdrew their diplomats from 
phnom penh in 1975 after the takeover by the brutal khmer rouge 
regime which killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians before the 
vietnamese invasion of december 1978 the japanese embassy was not 
reopened after the invasion 
at the news conference kondo said the japanese officials visit 
would be informal and does not mean that japan recognizes the 
government of premier hun sen which vietnam sponsors 
he said the purpose would be to assess the economic aid needed 
to rebuild cambodia after the end of hostilities between the hun 
sen government and a threeparty guerrilla alliance which includes 
the khmer rouge japan and western nations recognize the alliance 
japan has not formally accepted vietnams statement that its 
soldiers are out of cambodia the withdrawal was not monitored by 
international observers 
kondo said nakayama told thai officials japan considered 1990 
the most important year for the realization of peace in 
cambodia he said his government hoped to play a peace role by 
encouraging dialogue between china which backs the khmer rouge 
and the soviet union which supports vietnam 
he quoted nakayama as saying the impact of democratic reform in 
eastern europe would inevitably come to asia he said siddhi 
the thai foreign minister predicted gradual changes in asias 
communist nations

the leader of a oneman crusade to open 
a home for people with aids has left town emotionally battered and 
financially strapped but insisting wednesday that his was a 
successful fight to change attitudes 
ive never felt that i failed charles baxter said about the 
home he closed after only a few months it opened the door and it 
made it possible for others to get help 
baxter 44 loaded a van with his belongings tuesday and left 
the area he said he doesnt know if hell return 
i need a fresh start i dont think people can ever imagine 
what i went through he said in a telephone interview from an 
uncles home in kansas city kan 
baxter a longtime home healthcare provider spent nearly a 
year battling city officials who opposed his plan he opened our 
place in september after he and the american civil liberties union 
won a federal court case challenging bellevilles refusal to grant 
him a special zoning permit 
our place briefly housed three men with the aids virus two of 
whom died at the home baxter closed the leased facility in 
midnovember saying donations needed to cover operating costs 
never materialized 
he financed what he did accomplish by selling his home in 
highland about 20 miles north as well as his truck and other 
belongings 
controversy over the project hurt us a lot baxter said 
turning some people against the effort and likely reducing the flow 
of needed contributions 
but the nice thing about it as a result of what we did there 
aids homes are springing up all over the country i think we 
accomplished a lot he said 
baxters departure sparked mixed feelings in this city of 45000 
people across the mississippi river from st louis 
he helped change the awareness and the acceptance that aids 
is a concern for communities as a whole to address said scott 
schanuel executive director of belleville economic progress inc 
schanuel predicts baxters fight will pave the way for other 
aids homes though he said the closure proved to many that 
there are more questions than there are answers about dealing 
with people with aids 
mayor richard brauer an opponent of the shelter said he did 
not wish baxter ill and believes there might have been a place 
for that house in a more rural setting 
the city initially denied baxter a special zoning permit on 
grounds that he would be unable to fund the project and lacked 
medical expertise to care for aids patients officials also 
objected to the homes proximity to downtown and a junior high 
school 
but us district judge william stiehl ruled that the citys 
denial violated a new provision of the fair housing act barring 
discrimination against the handicapped 
aclu attorney john hammel said the ruling was the first to apply 
the provision to aids patients and would clear the way for future 
establishment of aids homes 
baxter recently settled his damage claim against the city out of 
court for 29000 but said he had just 2000 left after paying 
bills not enough to keep our place open

the interim leadership announced 
wednesday it had chosen an 11member executive committee led by 
president ion iliescu that apparently will have ultimate authority 
col gen vasile ionel army chief of staff denied foreign news 
reports the uprising that overthrew dictator nicolae ceausescu was 
planned months in advance but said discontent had been increasing 
in the army intelligentsia and general population 
the revolution was spontaneous but the discontent had been 
piling up for years he told reporters civilians and the 
military alike had felt the hardships the army was dissatisfied by 
the way it was treated as a labor force on huge projects without 
any benefit for romania 
ionel said at least 196 soldiers had died fighting for the 
revolution 
a soldier was seriously wounded by a snipers bullet overnight 
a reminder that the fight continued against holdout members of 
ceausecus hated security police known as the securitate 
ceausescu and his wife elena the second most powerful person 
in romania were deposed dec 22 and executed on dec 25 
in another announcement wednesday the leadership said it was 
scrapping three organizations set up by ceausescu which had the 
stated purpose of exercising popular control over his government 
rompres the official news agency reported that the national 
salvation front had created the executive committee 
romania also has a cabinet led by premier petre roman but real 
authority lies with the front which has has assumed legislative 
powers and chose the premier the council membership as reported 
by the news agency did not include roman 
dumitru mazilu was chosen first deputy to iliescu on the 
executive committee rompres reported mazilu criticized the former 
regime in a report smuggled out of romania this fall to the un 
human rights commission in geneva where he worked until ceausescu 
put him under house arrest in 1987 
smaller groups within the executive committee have 
responsibility for human rights constitutional matters foreign 
policy the economy reconstruction national minorities and other 
areas the agency reported 
some additions were made wednesday to romans cabinet including 
ministers for geology the mines post office and communications 
foreign trade and a president of the foreign trade bank it said 
the national salvation front has moved rapidly to dismantle the 
agencies ceausescu used control of the country 
rompres said the committee for problems of popular councils the 
central council for workers control of economic and social 
activity and the council of economic and social organization were 
put out of business wednesday 
although their ostensible purpose was to provide links between 
ceausescu and the citizens the councils had no powers 
ionel the chief of staff said there is a high number of dead 
all over the country from the fighting but just how many died 
in the revolution will be found out later 
he said 196 army officers and noncommissioned officers had been 
killed and more than 450 wounded he did not give a figure for 
common soldiers who presumably would do most of the fighting 
the army is in control of the situation but we continue to be 
careful ionel said some vital facilities are still under 
guard 
thousands of securitate members have been reported arrested but 
hundreds are said to remain at large ionel said those arrested 
were being interrogated and will be punished according to their 
deeds 
romanians say thousands of people died in the revolution many 
of them anticeausescu protesters killed by securitate members but 
the actual casualty toll is not known 
at his news conference ionel said soldiers refused orders to 
fire on protesters in the western city of timisoara where the 
revolution began dec 15 but some elements of the security 
troops had infiltrated into the army and fired upon the people 
at least six political parties have been formed and some have 
begun laying out their objectives in advance of free elections 
promised for april 
nicolae costel a 38yearold school administrator and spokesman 
for the romanian democratic party recommended delaying the 
elections 
the christian democratic national peasants party also has urged 
postponement contending that early elections give candidates of 
the interim government an unfair advantage 
silviu brucan a member of the national salvation front said 
monday it probably would enter candidates in the elections 
costel said his party would be similar to social democratic 
parties in the west since people have become allergic to the 
word socialism 
he said his party sought free elections in the second half of 
1990 free unions and the right to strike elimination of the 
communist party monopoly on power free travel continued 
membership in the warsaw pact and possible membership in the 
european economic community

more than 500000 gallons of heating oil 
not 5000 may have leaked into the busy arthur kill shipping 
channel from a break in an exxon pipeline the coast guard said 
wednesday 
coast guard spokesman jeff crawley said exxon issued the new 
estimate after taking an inventory of its supplies he said 420000 
to 546000 gallons could have leaked 
the coast guard previously estimated 5000 gallons of the 
lightweight no 2 oil had spilled into the channel which separates 
staten island ny from new jersey the spill discovered tuesday 
morning resulted from a break in a 12inch pipe at exxons bayway 
terminal part of the oil giants largest east coast refinery 
crews continue work wednesday to contain the floating oil 
setting up booms to trap the oil laying out absorbent material 
skimming it off the surface or absorbing it with vacuums 
exxon spokesman louis jung said divers had determined there was 
a 4foot by halfinch gash in the underwater pipe which connects 
the exxon plant in bayonne to its bayway refinery and chemical 
plant in linden 
divers confirmed the line was struck or hit by something it 
did not fail he said 
a fourmember emergency coast guard strike force was on its way 
from its base in mobile ala crawley said 
jung said the discrepancy in the size of the spill may have been 
due to confusion over whether the initial figures referred to 
barrels or gallons of oil there are 42 gallons in a barrel of oil 
jung said the 67milelong pipe carries oil to several holding 
tanks each of which had to be checked to test its level before the 
size of the spill could be determined 
the spill produced a slick estimated at 11 miles long in a 
heavily industrial area already badly polluted said jeanine 
mosley a spokeswoman for the state department of environmental 
protection 
oil also has washed ashore along a sixmile area on the the west 
coast of staten island she said 
ms mosley said state regulators were awaiting further 
information before assessing the full damage caused by the spill

a stock deal in which the government contends 
charles h keating jr stripped his lincoln savings and loan 
association of 12 million in potential profits was defended 
wednesday by attorneys for the phoenix millionaire 
accusing the government of monday morning quarterbacking 
keatings attorneys contended in us district court that federal 
thrift regulations precluded lincoln from exercising an option to 
repurchase the 79275 shares of memorex common stock in late 
october 1987 four months after selling it 
the stock transaction is one of four deals that regulators have 
cited as examples of unsafe and unsound practices that 
justified their takeover of the irvine calif thrift last april 
all of the transactions are being examined by us district 
court judge stanley sporkin as part of a suit by keating against 
the government seeking to undo the takeover 
in turn the government has filed a 11 billion civil 
racketeering and fraud suit against keating that is now before a 
federal judge in phoenix and a grand jury in los angeles is 
weighing possible criminal charges against him 
keating also is the central figure in a congressional ethics 
investigation five senators accepted a total of 13 million in 
campaign and other contributions from him and then interceded with 
federal thrift regulators on lincolns behalf 
in november he claimed fifth amendment protection against 
selfincrimination in refusing to answer questions before the house 
banking committee but he is expected to be called as a witness 
again friday in his suit against the government attorneys said 
regulators now claim that lincolns loss of federally insured 
deposits through direct land and stock investments by keating and 
sham real estate sales eventually could cost taxpayers up to 2 
billion making it the most expensive of nearly 600 sampl failures in 
the past two years 
the memorex deal dates back to december 1986 when lincoln 
acquired the 79275 shares for a dollar each as a sweetener for 
buying 40 million of junk bonds as part of a leveraged buyout 
attempt by british financier sir james goldsmith to acquire the 
company 
the following april and may lincoln sought to sell the stock to 
its holding company american continental corp for 35 a share 
which would have yielded the thrift a profit of 27 million 
regulators however refused to allow the sale believing the 
stock was worth much more than 35 a share 
to get around the regulations the government claims keating 
called upon phoenix developer and stock broker ec garcia to act 
as a conduit to transfer ownership of the stock from lincoln to 
american continental 
keating reportedly telling garcia that the stock was worth 126 
per share or about 10 million arranged for lincoln to sell it to 
him in june 1987 for 1 million or about 1250 a share with an 
option to purchase it back for 425 million or about 5350 a 
share 
when the stock market crashed the following october garcia told 
the securities and exchange commission that he was in desperate 
need for cash and that he sold the stock to american continental 
for 2 million or about 2525 per share 
six months later in march and april of 1988 american 
continental sold the stock for 167 a share or 133 million 
reaping a total profit of 12 million 
kevin oconnell the governments chief regulator in the case 
testified wednesday that american continentals purchase of the 
stock denied lincoln the profit and amounted to a usurpation of 
corporate opportunity that violated rules regulating the 
relationship between sampls and their holding companies 
one of keatings attorneys michael kennedy however contended 
that lincoln could not have repurchased the memorex shares because 
regulators at the time were claiming that it already exceeded 
imposed limits on direct investments by thrifts in land and stock 
kennedy accused the regulators of monday morning 
quarterbacking saying officials in oconnells office would 
likely have objected to any stock purchase by lincoln within the 
week after the oct 19 1987 stock market crash 
in reponse to a question oconnell acknowledged that it was 
impossible to predict the crash when lincoln sold the stock to 
garcia as well as several events favorable to memorex just as a 
10for1 stock split early in 1988 that boosted its value 
dramatically after american continental purchased it

the publisher of the jerusalem post refused 
wednesday to sign a pledge to stay out of the newspapers editorial 
process an issue that prompted 30 reporters and editors to resign 
this week 
during a meeting called by the journalists union publisher 
yehuda levy also rejected demands that vacant posts be filled from 
within the paper and he refused to rehire the reporters and 
editors who quit in the dispute 
im not going to make it into a kibbutz said levy a former 
army officer he took the job in july three months after the 
canadian newspaper group hollinger inc bought the post 
i will not tell you what to write and i will not tell you 
what not to write levy said but he rejected staff requests that 
he sign a statement promising not to interfere in the editorial 
process 
the journalists who quit said in identical letters of 
resignation that there has been an everincreasing erosion of 
editorial independence accompanied by an assault on the editorial 
line which the paper has embodied since its establishment 
they included managing editor david landau features and 
magazine editor joanna yehiel and middle east editor yehuda litani 
although one of the smallest of israels seven major daily 
newspapers the post published in english has great influence 
foreign diplomats and journalists are among its readers and its 
weekly international edition reaches as many as 50000 readers 
abroad 
the post has been a leader in covering the palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza strip 
the newspapers top editor erwin frenkel quit dec 25 over a 
letter levy had written to the editors committee israels most 
prestigious media organization 
levy was seeking to join the group and wrote as president and 
publisher i intend to become very involved in the work of the 
editorial staff with all that this implies 
frenkel told the post news staff on wednesday that the dispute 
was over the authority of the publisher and the authority of the 
editor under these conditions yours truly cannot be the 
editor 
frenkel worked for the post for 28 years and was editor for 13 
years 
journalists told levy on wednesday they were concerned about his 
removal of an editorial written by frenkel from the posts weekly 
international edition 
the editorial defended the posts right to criticize the 
government it was written after prime minister yitzhak shamir 
accused the post of harming israels reputation abroad by reporting 
critically on shamirs trip to the united states 
the papers editorial staff filed notice of a labor dispute dec 
28 and demanded levys removal the notice will allow them to take 
action including a strike or work slowdown after a twoweek 
cooling off period 
levy has said about 80 journalists still work for the newspaper 
he was appointed president and publisher in july by david 
radler chairman of the board of hollinger inc which bought a 
controlling interest in the post in april 
the newspaper was established in 1932 as the palestine post and 
changed its name to the jerusalem post in 1950 two years after the 
founding of the jewish state

planes last month bombed and harassed 
rebelheld towns in southern sudan striking about every other day 
and disrupting famine relief operations a un official said 
wednesday 
the planes bombed seven towns 10 times during the first three 
weeks of december said the official who spoke on condition he not 
be identified 
those that didnt bomb the towns made low flights in an apparent 
attempt at intimidation the official said 
no one has claimed responsibility for the aerial action 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army which has been 
fighting sudans government for nearly seven years has no planes 
and has blamed sudans military government led by lt gen omar 
hassan elbashir who seized power in a june 30 coup 
in october four people were killed when warplanes bombed the 
rebelheld town of yirol 620 miles southwest of sudans capital 
khartoum 
while none of the december bombings produced any casualties 
they disrupted medical and agricultural programs being administered 
by employees of the uncoordinated operation lifeline sudan 
they bomb from great heights and not with great accuracy but 
it makes work difficult for people who have to be prepared for 
aerial attacks and scurry into bomb shelters said the un 
official 
the government has accused some relief workers of using 
operation lifeline sudan to ferry arms and supplies to rebels and 
a government committee recommended wednesday that government 
representatives supervise relief operations in southern sudan 
peter orat the cabinet minister of relief and displaced people 
said the government would not object if the rebels also wanted to 
have representatives on relief operations 
the report by the committee in charge of relief is expected to 
be presented and endorsed by the cabinet in the coming days 
following the yirol bombing sudans government in november 
suspended relief flights as well as the movement of food by rail 
and barge severely curtailing operation lifeline sudan since 
april it had been moving food and supplies into the warravaged 
and droughtstricken region 
the operation which moved nearly 100000 tons of emergency food 
to the south before the flight ban has been credited with averting 
a repeat of 1988s tragedy when up to 250000 southern sudanese 
died from warexacerbated famine 
operation lifeline is able to move only limited amounts of 
supplies into sudan by road from kenya since the ban it has been 
unable to resupply medical teams 
as a result at least 70 people in leer about 50 miles 
northwest of yirol have died of an insectborn disease called 
kalazar because the drug used in the diseases therapy has been 
halted said the official

donna rice the femme fatale of the 1987 gary 
hart political debacle has surfaced again this time as a 
bornagain christian and doer of good deeds 
she has the washington times said in a lengthy profile in 
wednesday editions returned to the values of her childhood and 
her friends travel in some of washingtons most conservative 
circles 
miss rice who lives with a female friend in northern virginia 
declined to be interviewed for the times story the newspaper said 
her relationship with hart then the leading candidate for the 
democratic partys presidential nomination became fodder for a 
nation of wagging tongues when the miami herald reported that hart 
spent much of a weekend alone in his washington home with a young 
woman 
that woman later was identified as miss rice 
the washington times story was illustrated with a large picture 
of a smiling miss rice wearing a green knit sweater and santa 
claus hat she carries a camera and the caption reads inside a 
district of columbia church donna rice moves from group to 
group snapping photos of youngsters celebrating 
it was pictures of a different sort that added to the 1987 
contretemps that sank harts candidacy those pictures were of a 
smiling donna rice sitting on the lap of the former colorado 
senator aboard a luxury craft called monkey business his wife 
lee was not in the picture 
a few days after the miami herald story hart said in a speech 
that he had made a mistake putting himself into circumstances that 
could be misconstrued 
did i do anything immoral hart asked i absolutely did 
not 
he dropped out of the presidential race five days after the 
newspaper story he later made a brief unsuccessful foray into the 
race 
shes just a wonderful lady a friend andy messing said 
wednesday about miss rice 
he told the times that miss rice 32 went back to her roots 
and because she did she wound up coming out of a tailspin that 
would have killed other people 
miss rice became an instant celebrity but she spurned most 
commercial offers her image became that as a golddigging party 
girl 
today miss rice lives a fairly simple and largely private 
life the newspaper said she does not have a fulltime paying 
job but friends say she keeps busy shuttling neighborhood 
children to school grocery shopping for her host family attending 
charity events and getting involved quietly in charitable 
work 
the newspaper said she has a boyfriend and attends washingtons 
highprofile dinners and events she experienced her religious 
renewal after moving to virginia the times said 
donna has not gone through that much of a change said 
tricia erickson head of a mclean va modeling agency and miss 
rices designated crisis manager in 1987 told the times 
i dont think that she went to god so to speak donnas 
always been like that it isnt some miraculous thing ms 
erickson said adding that miss rice has done extensive charity 
work 
later miss erickson told another reporter that she wanted to 
check with miss rice before saying more

the late vladimir horowitz and nat king cole will receive lifetime 
achievement awards at this years grammy awards ceremonies 
mccartney clark and davis have agreed to appear feb 21 at the 
shrine auditorium in los angeles for the grammy telecast said 
michael greene president of the national academy of recording 
artists 
mccartneys impact on music as a songwriter and member of the 
beatles as well as his continuing growth as a solo performer were 
cited as reasons for his award 
davis played a crucial role in the development of jazz since the 
1940s the academy said 
horowitz was included because many consider him the 20th 
centurys greatest classical pianist and cole was cited as a 
leading singer of the 1940s and 1950s 
the inclusion of clark was a surprise because he produces the 
american music awards which competes with the grammys the shows 
are a month apart and many artists will appear on only one show 
fearing overexposure 
we dont view these shows as competitive and when you look at 
the big contribution clark has made to the recording industry 
especially in exposing new talent there is no question he is 
deserving greene said 
clark will receive the trustees award because he is a 
nonperforming contributor to music past recipients include 
inventors thomas edison and robert moog

the white house defended lauro f cavazos as 
an outstanding education secretary wednesday and said the 
cabinet job is his as long as he wants it 
marlin fitzwater made the comment in response to press reports 
critical of the lowkeyed cavazos 
the washington post carried a frontpage headline wednesday 
reading cavazos gets low marks and a recent jack anderson 
column suggested the former university president and medical school 
dean would be the first to exit the bush cabinet 
we think secretary cavazos has done an oustanding job hes 
been a great advocate for the presidents policy on choice in 
education hes traveled around the country and he meets with the 
president regularly were very pleased with his work said 
fitzwater 
he has the job as long as he wants it hes doing a great job 
and its unfair of certain public interest groups to try to 
stimulate these kinds of stories which is my judgment of how they 
come about said fitzwater 
cavazos could not be reached for comment 
he was scheduled to meet with bush in the oval office on 
tuesday but was called out of town and the meeting put off until 
next week the white house said 
cavazos in a statement issued by his office said i serve at 
the president of the president and am commited to helping george 
bush be the education president nothing has changed my commitment 
to that goal 
cavazos became education chief in september 1988 for the final 
four months of the reagan presidency and bush kept the texan on he 
was the first hispanic american ever to hold a cabinet post 
he helped organize bushs education summit with the governors 
last september where an agreement was reached to draw up the first 
set of national performance goals for americas schools 
cavazos has been less outspoken and less confrontational than 
his predecessor william j bennett who frequently pilloried 
teacher unions college presidents and other pillars of the 
education establishment bennett is now bushs drug policy 
coordinator

peru has reversed its decision to boycott the 
upcoming colombia drug summit in protest of the us military 
invasion of panama and will attend after all us and peruvian 
officials said wednesday 
it has not been decided whether president alan garcia will 
attend the meeting with president bush and the presidents of 
colombia and bolivia or whether he will send a lower ranking 
official to reiterate his objection to the us military action 
officials said 
only if bush withdraws the troops he sent will garcia himself go 
to the feb 15 meeting in cartagena said one peruvian diplomat 
who spoke on condition of anonymity garcia said two weeks ago that 
he could not meet with the leader of an invading nation 
peru does plan to participate in a jan 1014 preparatory 
meeting in santa cruz bolivia where representatives of the four 
countries will work on the final agenda for the summit officials 
said 
last week peru was already softening its hard line on panama 
ending its suspension of antinarcotics operations with us agents 
in the cocarich huallaga valley officials in lima said those 
operations would be resumed because of a need to keep the antidrug 
war going 
at the bolivia presummit meeting this month the three andean 
countries peru bolivia and colombia will meet for the first 
two days and be joined by a us team for the last two days 
a goal will be to draw up a communique that bush and the other 
countries leaders can sign at the summit in colombia the 
communique will address cooperation and coordination in the war on 
drug trafficking the officials said 
in addition bilateral agreements may be reached since each of 
the andean countries has different economic circumstances and needs 
different types of us assistance said john walters deputy to 
bushs drug policy coordinator william bennett 
subjects to be discussed at the summit include law enforcement 
cooperation security assistance from the united states trade 
issues economic assistance and sharing of education and 
intelligence about drugs walters said 
one of the key points us officials have been stressing is the 
need for peru and bolivia the two leading producers of coca plant 
for cocaine to involve their military forces in helping to fight 
drug lords said michael skol the deputy assistant secretary of 
state for south america who will lead the us team to the jan 10 
meeting the united states is offering military training to 
facilitate that aim 
skol said talks leading to the summit have gone well beginning 
with a trip to the three south american countries in december by 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson and other us 
officials 
were pretty much in agreement on everything skol said 
wednesday adding however that much work needs to be done to put 
down the agreement into words 
peru withdrew from the summit after bush sent thousands of 
troops into panama on dec 20 to oust gen manuel antonio noriega 
from power 
us officials have been encouraging peru to change its mind 
and on wednesday white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
announced that peru indicates they intend to participate 
he said he was citing a news account that quoted peruvian 
officials rather than official diplomatic contacts but other us 
officials said they had reason to believe the report was accurate 
originally the drug summit was organized by the three andean 
nations as a forum to discuss cooperation and coordination against 
drug production processing and trafficking 
in no way did peru want to boycott the meeting said the 
peruvian official adding that his government may have acted 
hastily in pulling out of the summit after the panama invasion 
sometimes you say things and then you realize it wasnt the 
proper thing to say the official said 
peru is the worlds major producer of coca leaf while colombia 
is the leader in processing and exporting the plant for cocaine

sen alfonse damato rny sent more mail 
during a sixmonth period last year than any other senator 166 
million pieces at a cost of 266 million according to a recent 
report by the secretary of the senate 
however an earlier report shows damato sent only 3000 pieces 
in the six previous months 
the flurry between april 1 and sept 30 came as questions were 
raised about damatos influence at the department of housing and 
urban development and as congress was debating limits on 
constituent mail 
the house ethics committee has announced a preliminary 
investigation of damatos housingrelated actions 
frank coleman a spokesman for damato said wednesday that the 
senator historically has done the majority of his constituent 
mailing at the end of the legislative session 
thats when issues develop when they become more important 
coleman said 
subjects of the mailings included the drug bill and catastrophic 
health care both of which came toward the end of the session 
coleman said 
none of the mailings dealt with news reports about damatos 
ties to the housing scandal although one piece covered a housing 
bill damato introduced with sen alan cranston dcalif coleman 
said 
coleman said damato spent considerably less per capita on 
mailings in the last six months of the fiscal year about 15 cents 
than some other senators the cost varies because of the number 
of constituents in each states 
we werent even among the top 10 coleman said 
during the last six months of fiscal 1989 sen rudy boschwitz 
rminn sent 106 million pieces costing 16 million or 36 cents 
per constituent sen dan coats rind appointed to fill the seat 
vacated by vice president dan quayle sent 131 million pieces for 
the period costing 18 million or 32 cents per constitutent 
both boschwitz and coats are up for reelection this year 
damatos term expires in 1992 
franking reforms passed by congress last year limit the amount 
of money that may be used for mass mailings damatos limit for 
the fiscal year that began oct 1 for example will be 770000 
the senate rules committee staff has estimated

rebellious christian commander michel aoun before dawn wednesday 
and at least five people were reported killed but the apparent 
target was not injured 
in south lebanon rival shiite moslem militias battled in the 
orchards of iqlin altuffah the apple province for supremacy in 
the predominantly shiite region 
lt col adel sassin escaped unhurt as his guards battled the 
attackers in the mountain town of beit meri in the christian 
enclave eight miles east of beirut police reported

four of those killed were soldiers guarding the sassin 
residence said a statement from aouns command it identified the 
fifth person slain as saliba youssef a christian civilian whose 
body was found in a pine forest near the house 
police said they believed youssef was one of the attackers but 
a television station run by aoun said he might have been an 
innocent witness killed by the attackers as they fled 
there was no claim of responsibility aouns command blamed the 
assault on infiltrators trying to create confusion in the 
310squaremile enclave north and east of beirut where 1 million 
christians live 
police said six people were killed and 18 wounded in the south 
lebanon fighting between hezbollah which is loyal to iran and the

soviet miners trying to form independent 
unions met with aflcio president lane kirkland on wednesday as 
part of their monthlong study of us labor unions and mining and 
safety practices 
the nine soviets who are among the leaders of the strikes by 
thousands of soviet miners that began last summer also met with 
united mine workers president richard trumka and will spend most of 
thursday at umw headquarters their trip will include stops in 
several cities 
kirkland referring to the tentative settlement reached this 
week to end a bitter ninemonth umw strike against the pittston 
coal co told the soviet miners that workers trying to gain a 
better life for their families must face and deal with powerful and 
entrenched forces in every society 
that is certainly true here 
last week the soviet government revoked the passport and exit 
visa of one miner who had been scheduled to make the tour sergei 
masalovich in a statement the aflcio called on the soviet 
government to reverse its crude decision that the federation 
said inaccurately claimed masalovich had been relieved of his 
duties by the vorkuta strike committee 
kirkland said officials of the aflcio were continuing to press 
for reversal of a november refusal by the soviet government to let 
an aflcio delegation visit the soviet union 
the visiting miners are the guests of the aflcio but the trip 
is being paid for under a us information agency exchange program 
the soviets are scheduled to visit mines in virginia or west 
virginia the colorado school of mines pittsburgh and atlanta 
labor leaders and a texas state aflcio convention 
when kirkland announced the soviets visit last month he 
compared their struggle to that of solidarity organizers in poland 
in the early 1980s and pledged to offer the federations support 
even if it meant defying the soviet government 
the aflcios support of solidarity included the smuggling of 
printing and other communications equipment into poland while 
solidarity was outlawed in all the federation gave about 5 
million worth of equipment and other assistance to solidarity

wednesday to the leader of a us soviet and chinese climbing team 
that hopes to mark earth day 1990 by standing on the top of mount 
everest and clean up debris left by previous expeditions to the top 
of the worlds highest peak 
bush handed the flag to jim whittaker the first american to 
climb mount everest after signing a proclamation declaring april 
22 as earth day and calling on the american people to rededicate 
themselves in their practices as consumers and citizens to 
protecting the environment 
the first earth day was held in 1970 to call attention to 
environmental problems and bush said during a brief white house 
ceremony this years version will give us an opportunity to 
reflect on the past 20 years and set the agenda for the next 
decade 
bush has pledged during his presidential campaign to be a leader 
in protecting the environment but has already had a string of 
runins with national environmental groups 
whittaker a port townsend wash resident said in an 
interview after the ceremony that the everest expedition will 
show through friendship and cooperation that high goals can be 
reached 
the 30person team represents the first time that climbers from 
the three countries have been involved in a joint expedition and 
whittaker said that weather permiting they hope to actually reach 
the summit on april 22 
the symbolism is really important whittaker said i 
believe that in the 1990s the environment will be the primary 
concern of the citizens of the world i would like to see millions 
on people on earth day doing something for mother earth 
whittaker said that over the years previous expeditions to the 
summit of the 29028foot mountain have left behind oxygen bottles 
tents and other debris 
i climbed it in 1963 and we left garbage whittaker said 
but the ethic was different then it was in the 1970s that we 
gained an environmental ethic and now we would like to return the 
summit of mount everest to a pristine condition 
climbers will haul the debris off the summit and other camps on 
the mountain in duffel bags and than yaks will be used to cart the 
garbage to roadheads whittaker said

the bush administration wednesday deplored the 
killing of two nuns in nicaragua but said the sandinista 
government had failed to support an allegation that usbacked 
contra rebels were to blame 
the white house said it did not know who ambushed the church 
workers monday night on a highway in a remote northeast section of 
the country 
two roman catholic nuns one american the other nicaraguan 
were killed a third nun and an americanborn nicaraguan bishop 
were wounded 
we deplore in the strongest terms this outrageous attack on 
religious workers and extend our deepest sympathy to the families 
of the victims white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters 
this is a tragic incident one that further underscores the 
need to bring peace stability and democracy to nicaragua 
he said that neither the us government nor church officials 
know who was responsible for the attack contra commanders have 
denied involvement he said 
the nicaraguan government has provided no information to 
substantiate its charge that the contras launched the attack and 
we hope the sandinistas do not seek to obscure this tragedy by 
engaging in a propaganda battle fitzwater said 
sen christopher dodd dconn long a critic of us policy in 
central america said that while it was not known who carried out 
the attack it was not an isolated incident and much of the 
continuing violence in nicaragua can be blamed squarely and 
unambiguously on the usbacked contra rebels 
at the very least i hope that this assault will awaken the 
administration to honor the peace process and the timetable for 
contra demobilization steps that will reverse the cycle of 
violence in nicaragua dodd said 
the united states stopped providing military aid to the contras 
in february 1988 the contras were to have begun disbanding 
voluntarily under the terms of a peace pact agreed to by central 
american leaders 
but the rebels operating primarily out of bases in honduras 
have not laid down their arms and the nicaraguan government 
recently broke off a ceasefire with the rebels elections are 
scheduled next month the first since the sandinistas toppled 
rightwing dictator anastasio somoza and came to power in 1979 
the killings of the church workers in nicaragua came less than 
two months after the murders of six jesuit priests at a university 
in el salvador 
the jesuits their housekeeper and her daughter were killed nov 
16 a few days after leftist rebels launched an offensive against 
the government of alfredo cristiani the jesuits had been viewed by 
the rightwing in el salvador as intellectual allies of the marxist 
guerrillas 
the us government has vehemently denied that it coerced an el 
salvadoran woman who allegedly witnessed men in uniform entering 
the jesuits residence into changing her story after being brought 
to florida for questioning 
we condemn the attack whoever did it state department 
spokesman richard boucher said about the killings in nicaragua 
our embassy in tegucigalpa honduras has been in contact with 
commanders of the resistance and the yatama who have denied that 
their forces were involved in the attack 
the yatama is a group of miskito indians allied with the contras 
even before the latest killings us church officials had been 
seeking a meeting with president bush to discuss what they fear may 
be an anticlerical campaign in central america

a late change in the amount of wages subject 
to the social security payroll tax this year is confusing some 
employers who received notices containing outdated information 
government officials said wednesday 
the social security administration in october announced that 
earnings up to 50400 would be subject to the payroll tax in 1990 
up from the 48000 cutoff in 1989 but in november congress 
enacted a deficitreduction bill that increased the figure to 
51300 for 1990 
steve pyrek a spokesman for the internal revenue service said 
the annual tax guide sent to employers late last year said the 
wage base would be 50400 a notice that the figure has been 
increased to 51300 will go out in a mailing later this month 
listing tax law changes he said 
earnings above the wage base are exempt from social security 
taxes 
theres been confusion because people are getting publications 
and various irs documents that have what was correct 
information thats now incorrect pyrek said 
social security administration spokesman frank battistelli said 
his agency plans a special mailing this month to 400 business and 
trade groups publicizing the change in the 1990 figure 
the wage base has gone up every year since 1971 with the latest 
increase affecting about 104 million workers and selfemployed 
individuals who have annual earnings over last years maximum of 
48000 
increases in the taxable wage base are tied to the increase in 
average annual wages the upward revision in the 1990 wage base 
occurred when congress decided to include deferred compensation 
such as earnings set aside in 401k retirement accounts in the 
formula used to calculate the total amount of wages in the economy 
that are subject to the social security tax 
adding deferred compensation to the calculation resulted in a 
biggerthanexpected increase in average annual wages 
the social security tax rate which applies to both employer and 
employee was 751 percent in 1989 and rises to 765 percent this 
year 
the rise in the wage base does not affect the tax paid by people 
earning less they will pay more social security taxes this year 
simply because of the increase in the tax rate for example 
someone earning 30000 in both 1989 and 1990 will see social 
security taxes increase by about 42 a year or 81 cents a week the 
employers tax payment increases by an equal amount 
the combined effects of the increased tax rate and the higher 
taxable wage base mean the maximum amount of social security taxes 
deducted will jump by 320 615 a week to 3924 for someone who 
earns 51300 or more

at least 61 barges that broke loose on the 
monongahela river including one that spilled 10000 gallons of 
gasoline were believed to have been improperly secured and the 
mooring operators could be fined a coast guard official said 
they are presumed to be negligent because you dont expect a 
barge thats fixed to the shore to break away on its own coast 
guard cmdr tony regalbuto said wednesday 
the operators of mooring areas in a 58mile stretch of rain and 
snowswollen river could be fined up to 1000 per vessel because 
of the new years day incidents regalbuto said on dec 26 the 
coast guard had warned operators a thaw was expected by the weekend 
they knew this was coming said paul behers spokesman for 
the pennsylvania department of environmental resources 
but two mooring operators said they felt they had taken adequate 
precautions 
the 10000gallon spill from one of the runaway barges caused 
only slight environmental damage officials said another barge 
holding 420000 gallons of fuel was pried tuesday from the maxwell 
dam 61 miles upstream from pittsburgh its cargo was intact 
at least 30 of the barges sank prompting the coast guard to 
halt river traffic along a 20mile stretch south of pittsburgh 
some of the submerged vessels were empty others carried coal the 
river was expected to reopen as soon as all the sunken barges were 
located possibly thursday the coast guard said 
late wednesday afternoon the coast guard began searching for 
sunken barges in the closed section of the river with sonar 
equipment from the army corps of engineers in louisville ky the 
procedure was expected to last at least until midnight 
the gasoline that spilled was on a barge that was ripped from 
mon river towing incs dock at speers 44 miles upstream from 
pittsburgh the vessel went over the locks and dam at charleroi 
then hit the monongahela bridge before coming to rest at new eagle 
14 miles farther downstream 
the spilled gasoline drifted down the ohio river to ohio and 
west virginia on wednesday becoming more diluted with every mile 
the farther it goes the less pronounced it would be behers 
said 
four other barges broke loose from mon river towing including 
the one hauling 420000 gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline 
james guttman mon river towing president said his company was 
investigating whether or not there is anything more we could have 
done 
we feel they were adequately moored for the conditions that we 
were having prior to the breakaway guttman said 
ltv spokeswoman debbie kavulich said her company took the 
necessary precautions prior to new years day at the companys 
mooring facility three miles upstream from pittsburgh where 15 of 
the wayward barges came from 
apparently the river had such a strong force and the ice was 
so thick when this force came through the barges broke 
loose she said its just one of those things with mother 
nature i cant explain it

health officials wednesday launched a program to 
reduce the states high rate of underweight newborns by encouraging 
and helping pregnant women who do not see doctors to get prenatal 
care 
the program better beginnings will be coordinated through the 
cityowned denver general hospital where the rate of low 
birthweight babies is nearly twice the national average 
colarado ranks eighth in the nation in the rate of newborns 
weighing less than 5 pounds behind six southern states and the 
district of columbia 
better beginnings will target women who do not see a doctor 
during their pregnancy said program spokeswoman cleo 
parkerrobinson 
im amazed by the delicacy of life especially the 
critical months between conception and birth she said there 
are so many dangers 
of the infants born at denver general 123 percent are 
underweight compared to the national average of 68 percent 
officials said the percentage is also significantly higher than 
the denver county rate of 97 percent 
the problem is most severe among newborns whose mothers either 
received no prenatal care or who first saw a doctor late in their 
pregnancies denver general officials said 22 percent of the 
deliveries at the hospital are to women in those categories 
such babies are at much higher risk of incurring serious health 
problems requiring extended hospitalization at birth they have a 
higher chance for lifelong physical handicaps and they have a 
higher death rate 
we still have many pregnant women whose first contact with a 
physician is on the day they show up at a delivery room said 
terri bailey director of the perinatal project at denver general 
in 1988 denver general delivered 183 babies to women who had 
not been seen by a doctor even once during their pregnancies 
a lack of prenatal care correlates strongly with babies who 
are born too early or born weighing less than 55 pounds she 
said such babies are 40 times more likely to die during their 
first year or to experience serious longterm physical and 
developmental problems 
better beginnings will use counselors to contact expectant women 
who normally would not seek out prenatal care and put them in touch 
with doctors at denverarea clinics as part of this effort 
brochures printed in spanish and english will be circulated 
the program will provide medical care help in seeking financial 
assistance through existing programs nutrition counseling 
followup counselors to encourage pregnant women to see doctors 
regularly counseling for any drug or alcohol abuse problems and a

east german leaders joined tens of thousands 
of people at the soviet war memorial wednesday night in a protest 
of neonazism the official news agency adn reported 
it said the demonstrators included gregor gysi the new 
communist party chief president manfred gerlach and other 
government leaders and vyacheslav kotchemassov soviet ambassador 
to east germany 
last week vandals painted nazi slogans on the memorial to 
soviet soldiers killed in berlin in world war ii the memorial is 
in the treptow district of east berlin 
adn initially said tens of thousands attended the 
demonstration wednesday in treplow which the communist party 
sponsored it later estimated the crowd at more than 250000 
people but a witness who has seen other large demonstrations in 
east germany said that was an exaggeration 
east germany plans its first free elections in may and the 
communist party admits it may have difficulty remaining in the 
government observers feel the party may use the neonazi issue in 
an attempt to build support and discourage sentiment for 
reunification with west germany 
the news agency quoted gysi as saying at the demonstration 
this country was born from antifascists dont let it become the 
homeland for neofascists 
he said democratic reforms were occurring in east germany only 
because of change promoted in the soviet union by president mikhail 
s gorbachev and therefore we cannot tolerate any form of 
antisovietism our land is in danger and it comes from the 
right 
zdf television of west germany showed pictures of the 
demonstrators some of whom chanted nazis out no third reich 
in reference to the hitler era of 193345 
banners carried by the crowd read we say no to reunification 
and no to the brown pest a reference to hitlers brownshirted 
storm troopers 
adn said representatives of dozens of prodemocracy groups 
attended the demonstration 
its report said neonazi skinheads and socalled nazi punks 
have contact with rightist radicals in west germany 
police investigations revealed that neonazis in east germany 
sympathized with the ultrarightist reupblican party which has 
pressed for an end to political asylum for foreigners in west 
germany and restrictions on the admission of foreign workers adn 
said 
neonazis want a united germany with the 1939 borders outside 
nato and the warsaw pact the agency report said 
vandals defaced monuments and public buildings in several east 
german cities over the new year holiday with shameful slogans 
such as jews out or foreigners out and communists against the 
wall adn said 
heinz galinski leader of the jewish community in west germany 
said in a statement wednesday he was shocked by the increasing 
reports of neonazi activity in east germany 
there is not the least doubt that there is a close connection 
with rightist radicals in west germany galinski said and urged 
east german government leaders to take energetic steps against 
the neonazi activity

the italian government said wednesday that scores of 
adoption cases involving romanian children had been resolved and a 
special plane would fly italian couples to the east bloc country 
this weekend to pick up their new children 
a communique from the foreign ministry in rome said the new 
romanian government had lifted a freeze on the adoptions of 130 
children by italians 
in 1987 the hardline communist government of president nicolae 
ceausescu froze adoptions by foreign citizens who had been paying 
thousands of dollars in fees and more in secret to get a child 
the foreign ministry said special flights would bring the 110 
sets of adoptive parents to romania to pick up the children 
the first dc9 is scheduled to carry 50 italians to bucharest 
this weekend to complete the adoption formalities and bring 33 
children back to italy the ministry said 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed dec 25 after a 
bloody popular revolt under ceausescus rule birth control 
abortions and family planning information were not permitted for 
women with fewer than five children 
the italian communique said the former regimes policies on 
adoption were not very humanitarian and expressed great 
satisfaction with the actions of the new government

patients at the dr g marinescu hospital have also included 
captured members of the securitate ceausescus dreaded special 
police who enforced his 24 years of increasingly repressive rule 
the emergency cases for the present are mostly people who have 
snapped under the stress of the revolution the fighting and the 
sleepless nights 
the majority are paranoid psychotic they believe they are 
being followed they are suffering from great anxiety and have an 
irrational fear of death said professor vasile predescu a 
leading psychiatrists 
they have periods of six eight 12 hours of intense 
restlessness based on anxiety predescu said 
there have been 200 such emergency cases of severe stress in the 
last 10 days a number he said was roughly equivalent to the number 
of people admitted with such a condition in a year 
the vast majority of these patients had no personal or family 
history of mental illness predescu said all of these patients 
are severely disturbed and not people in need only of some 
counseling to help them through troubled times however the 
doctors said the symptoms subside to some degree after 24 to 48 
hours of treatment with strong sedatives 
the vast number accuse ceausescu he added some still do 
not believe he is dead 
but we do added dr mariejean georgescu in a voice filled 
with contempt 
ceausescus repression reaching far into such private spheres 
as how many children a family could have where they lived or what 
they might have to eat or read caused many of the psychiatric 
disorders treated in this 14ward hospital that admits 30000 
patients a year said dr lucian alexandrescu 
there have also been many suicides around bucharest because 
their homes were destroyed said predescu referring to 
ceausescus policy of knocking down thousands of old bucharest 
homes to make way for his grandiose palace of the people in the 
center or clearing whole villages in the name of modernity 
many people became severely despondent just thinking that 
their house or their village was about to be destroyed he added 
alexandrescu said other patients could not cope with the 
pressures and stress of daily life under ceausescus regime 
women had to work they had to have children whether they 
wanted them or not it was difficult just finding food feeding the 
family he said 
they suffered from the impossibility of living normally ms 
georgescu added 
predescu said the patients at the hospital briefly included 
three securitate agents brought there by the army under heavy guard 
the terrorists exhibited a clinical picture of rapid changes 
from minute to minute they were in an intense delusional state 
they would say everyone in their family had been shot then they 
would not know where they were then they would deny their family 
had been shot he said 
alexandrescu said it was unclear if these securitate men 
referred to the widespread rumors that many of them were orphans 
or were taken from their parents and trained from childhood to 
serve ceausescu 
when they say they have no families it could be true or they 
could be protecting their families he said they were later 
moved to the hospital at jilava prison which used to house 
ceausescus political prisoners 
alexandrescu said that in a couple of weeks the hospital will 
begin to see the leading edge of a wave of people left severely 
despondent by grief over the victims of the revolution he said 
such depression takes time to build 
now is the calm after the storm he said then there will 
be a wave of depressive reactions 
we have the experience of the earthquake of 1977 when 
depressive reactions continued for up to six months after the 
quake he said referring to the devastating quakes that killed 
1900 bucharest residents 
dr constantin dincea said many people grieving over lost loved 
ones find comfort and solidarity with others suffering from a 
similar loss 
one of my colleagues lost her husband he was shot her grief 
dissolved at the funeral when she met all the other people who at 
the same moment were burying their dead he said they gave 
each other mutual support it was extraordinary compassionate 
human solidarity 
dincea who specializes in child psychology said the children 
have fared better in the emotional upheaval of the revolution 
children seem better equipped emotionally to deal with it 
he said they do not have a sense of the correct meaning of 
death 
the four doctors all believed that the end of ceausescu will 
mean fewer patients a gradual return to mental health for a nation 
caught in the web of madness 
they also said the end of the ceausescu years will also enable 
romanias 9100 psychiatrists to be better prepared to deal with 
mental illness 
ceausescu interfered they said with the free exchange of 
information with psychiatrists abroad he refused to allow 
foreigners to take part in conferences in romania or to permit 
romanian psychiatrists to travel abroad 
alexandrescu complained that romanias reputation in the field 
as in many others suffered in recent years because ceausescu made 
it so difficult even for them to publish papers abroad 
it was awful awful he said you could get sick just 
trying to do this a successful applicant would make a good 
candidate for hospitalization here

a state museum has decided to shut down an 
exhibit featuring the exposed graves of 234 prehistoric american 
indians because of heightened sensitivity to display of human 
remains an official said 
our plans right now are to turn out the lights and to lock the 
door judith franke the director of the dickson mounds museum 
said wednesday 
ms franke said the exhibit hadnt been the target of protests 
or complaints but clearly was a livingonborrowedtime sort of 
thing 
in the face of protests the smithsonian institution in 
washington agreed last fall to return to american indians eskimos 
and aleuts for burial more than 18000 ancestral remains indian 
groups had long sought their return on religious grounds while 
museum officials had argued the remains were needed for study 
ms franke said the rest of the dickson mounds museum will be 
open and the remains will likely remain where they are 
obviously there is no question of moving the burials because 
they have been here for 1000 years and they have never been 
moved she said 
the decision to close the exhibit definitely shows dignity and 
respect for the prehistoric native american remains in illinois 
jesse takeshorse a crow indian from the southern illinois hamlet 
of dow said wednesday 
ms takeshorse said indian groups are drafting a letter to 
formally request reburial of the remains and said no decision had 
been made on location 
i think its a good first step said james yellowbank a 
winnebago indian and coordinator of the chicagobased indian treaty 
rights organization theres a lot of other burial sites that are 
in question some in southern illinois and some in elgin 
the exposed graves in an excavated burial mound are the 
highlight of the museum near this westcentral illinois community 
of 3000 the museum attracts 80000 vistors annually who can see 
the exhibit from an elevated viewing area photographing the 
exhibit is prohibited 
the bodies represent the last traces of the people who lived in 
the illinois river valley area during the late woodland and 
mississippian cultural periods between 800 and 1000 years ago 
the decision to close the exhibit to the public beginning feb 1 
was prompted by heightened sensitivity to display of human 
remains said david fields a spokesman for gov james r 
thompson 
but alan harn curator of anthropology at the museum said the 
decision represents a tremendous loss to indian people 
for 63 years the dickson excavation has been treated with the 
absolute utmost respect and many people go away from here with 
a new appreciation of the place of the american indian harn said 
state rep tom homer said he will press for reversal of the 
decision on grounds that closure of the popular exhibit may cripple 
the tourist and cultural attraction 
the dickson burial site was discovered more than 60 years ago 
when landowner don f dickson found ancient skeletons under the 
family fruit orchard the amateur archeologist began an excavation 
in 1927 and later built a museum over the site 
the museum bought by the state in 1945 contains several other 
exhibits focusing on the culture and lifestyle of prehistoric 
indians who subsisted on corn and fish and lived in houses 
thatched with prairie grass

the former director of israels mossad 
intelligence agency on wednesday assailed prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs purported use of classified information to expose a 
cabinet ministers contacts with the plo 
israeli newspaper reports quoted other intelligence officials as 
saying the disclosures may have hurt state security and affected 
the informationgathering capabilities of mossad and shin bet 
israels external and internal intelligence agencies 
if what i have read in the newspapers is correct harm has 
been done to the intelligence services former mossad director 
meir amit said 
the political echelons must know the complexities and 
sensitivities of gathering information and they must think twice 
before using this information he told israel television 
shamir a former mossad official dismissed amits allegations 
and said the material was used to stop science minister ezer 
weizman from leaking confidential government information to 
palestinians 
the use in this case was for state reasons of the highest 
level shamir said we are not talking about political needs 
here grave damage was caused to israel 
shamir said he showed the classified material to no one and 
did not think that as a result any damage will be done 
weizmans alleged contacts with the plo ignited a political 
crisis that almost brought down the coalition government in 
remarks wednesday on army radio he appeared to blame shamir for 
misusing the information he got from the agencies 
i have no complaints against the shin bet or mossad i have 
complaints against those who receive the material and decided 
afterwards to use it for political reasons weizman said 
the security services report directly to the prime minister 
shamir 74 leader of the rightwing likud bloc forced weizman 
to quit the inner cabinet which is responsible for security 
issues but kept him on as science minister he said weizman a 
former defense minister used his inside knowledge to thwart 
government efforts to exclude the palestine liberation organization 
from negotiations 
leftwing dailies davar and al hamishmar said shamir based his 
allegations on a mossad report showing that weizman met with plo 
official nabil ramlawi in a geneva hotel room last june 6 and also 
spoke by telephone to israeli arab dr ahmed tibi who was in tunis 
acting as a gobetween with plo officials 
excerpts leaked to the press suggested weizman advised the plo 
to push shamir for a landforpeace agreement and to insist on a 
role in negotiations even though government policy is opposed to 
plo involvement 
yediot ahronot newspaper quoted unidentified intelligence 
sources as saying shamir exposed sources and operational methods 
by the misuse of the intelligence material against weizman 
defense minister yitzhak rabin denied on army radio that 
intelligence sources or methods were compromised 
asked if wiretaps were used against weizman rabin replied to 
the best of my knowledge political wiretapping of political 
figures in the state of israel does not exist 
but dedi zucker a parliament member of the liberal citizens 
rights movement said shamir revealed that israel had a transcript 
of ramlawis conversation with weizman 
he suggested that shamir pulled back from his threat to fire 
weizman lest an official investigation release much more than he 
wanted

nearing completion 5000 to 6000 us soldiers will be withdrawn 
this year because of us congressional demands and defense budget 
cuts a report said wednesday 
about 43000 american troops including the 2nd us infantry 
division are stationed in south korea under a mutual defense pact 
us troops fought on the south korean side after communist north 
korea invaded to start the 195053 korean war 
the national news agency yonhap citing unidentified korean 
government sources said wednesday that the two governments had

on measures to reorganize american forces in east asia including 
south korea 
the us 8th army headquarters in seoul refused to comment on 
the report 
yonhap quoting another ranking government source also said the 
governments were studying the possibility of relocating us 
marines now stationed in okinawa to south korea in a move linked to 
the longrange idea of maintaining stability in east asia 
the korean official was quoted as saying the two countries 
shared the view that us troops were needed at the present level 
until there is improvement in relations between north and south 
korea 
washington repeatedly has said us troops will not be withdrawn 
as long as south korean officials feel they are needed 
in another report the daily donga ilbo said that for the first 
time the united states and south korea were expected to scale back 
this years annual team spirit military exercises to create a 
better atmosphere for northsouth dialogue 
radical students and dissidents have staged violent 
demonstrations demanding withdrawal of us troops claiming they 
hinder unification efforts with north korea the radicals are a 
small minority and polls show the majority of koreans want the 
americans to stay until relations with north korea improve

a contra leader said wednesday his 
rebel group was incapable of the attack that killed two nuns 
one of them an american and asserted nicaragua was blaming the 
rebels to rob them of us congressional support 
we protect the civilian population we are catholic and we 
support the episcopal work of the catholic church said aristides 
sanchez of the nicaraguan resistance in comments on costa rican 
radio 
but the leftist sandinista government called the incident in 
which a third nun and an auxiliary bishop also were wounded a 
premeditated ambush by the usbacked contras 
the bush administration deplored the killing of the nuns but 
said the managua government failed to back up its charge that 
contras were responsible the body of sister maureen courtney 45 
will be flown back to her hometown of milwaukee thursday after a 
memorial service wednesday in a managua church 
sister courtney and sister teresa rosales 24 of nicaragua were 
killed when their pickup truck was attacked in a zone called ojo de 
agua between the mining towns of rosita and siuna in northeastern 
nicaragua 
the area is in a contra stronghold in remote zelaya province 
250 miles northeast of managua the capital 
both nuns belonged to the order of st agnes as did sister 
francisca colomer 24 a third nun who suffered face and body 
wounds auxiliary bishop pablo schmitz 48 from fond du lac wis 
and of the capuchin order was wounded in the left arm 
the two were being treated wednesday in a managua military 
hospital and were expected to recover 
sister jean steffes mother superior for the sisters of st 
agnes said in fond du lac on wednesday 
both sisters were killed instantly as result of gunfire the 
white pickup truck in which the group was traveling was clearly 
marked with yellow crosses 
when those still alive in the truck shouted they were 
religious the firing ceased but by then two were dead 
nicaraguas roman catholic church said it does not know who 
attacked the church workers 
before flying to managua on an air force plane schmitz told 
reporters in puerto cabezas he did not know who attacked them 
i only know that a mine went off or a grenade and there was 
heavy shooting afterward schmitz said we identified 
ourselves but nobody came to the pickup 
sanchez denied the contras were involved and accused the 
government of staging the attack 
he said the nicaraguan resistance an umbrella group of 
antisandinista organizations in exile regrets the incident but 
stressed the rebels are incapable of taking such an action 
in comments over the costa rican station radio impacto 
monitored in managua he called the sandinista charges a 
propaganda campaign to deprive the rebels of us congressional 
support 
that sort of campaign is to be expected on the part of the 
sandinistas when a change in the aid by the us congress is 
getting near sanchez said 
congress must soon decide whether to continue the nonlethal aid 
it has been giving the contras since february 1988 the aid package 
for the rebels runs out after nicaraguas general elections 
scheduled feb 25 
barricada the official sandinista newspaper on wednesday 
called the attack a premeditated ambush by the contras 
jaime arauz one of two peasants detained by the army in the

and were told the rebels were waiting to ambush an army convoy 
arauz spoke to the associated press and other news media in 
puerto cabezas a port town in northeastern nicaragua on tuesday 
dennis marker director in washington of the witness for peace 
organization said wednesday that documented evidence shows to be 
totally false contra denials that they operate in the area 
he told the ap by telephone he knows of many cases of contra 
attacks in the area the past year including the kidnapping two 
times of a local pastor in the region where the attack occurred 
witness for peace describes itself as a politically 
independent organization that opposes us support for the war 
against nicaragua while not taking sides on internal political 
issues

black leaders angered by the termination of 
the citys first black superintendent launched a boycott of selmas 
public schools wednesday calling their fight the unfinished 
civil rights movement 
boycott leaders and demonstrating parents said the absence from 
classrooms of one quarter of the citys 6000 public school 
students was at least a moral victory in their fight to keep school 
chief norward roussell 
but mayor joe smitherman a white who has been in and out of 
office since selma became a voting rights landmark in the 1960s 
called the boycott a failure based on the number of students 
showing up for classes 
the majoritywhite school board citing an unfavorable job 
evaluation voted dec 21 not to renew roussells contract when it 
expires june 30 the five blacks on the 11member board then 
resigned in protest 
the evaluation described roussell as dictatorial and said he had 
allowed teacher morale to drop he disputed the findings calling 
them unsubstantiated 
roussell 55 opposed the boycott he said having young people 
in class was more important than his 80000ayear post 
about a dozen pickets including some children gathered in the 
morning chill outside selma high school others protested at 
several of the citys 10 other schools and at several businesses 
wearing a sign reading how long will selma do wrong picket 
lola doss sang hymns and waved at passing cars near a gasoline 
station owned by the family of one of the white school board 
members 
god is in charge and selmas arms are too short to box with 
god said ms doss who kept her son home from school 
but other black parents heeded roussells request to ignore the 
boycott 
i sent my two children to school this morning said sheila 
mitchell she said she was displeased with roussells treatment 
but added children should be in school 
roussell said about 25 percent of the systems 6039 students 
were absent 
the system which is nearly 70 percent black normally has a 10 
percent absenteeism rate the first day after a long holiday break 
he said so the number of those heeding the boycott is really 
about 15 percent 
rose sanders a black attorney who spearheaded the protest 
estimated that as many as 40 percent of the citys black students 
did not go to class 
that is a success she said this is the unfinished civil 
rights movement or the unfinished civil war 
smitherman said plainclothes police officers used video cameras 
at the schools to record those participating in protests mrs 
sanders said officials had scared blacks from joining the protest 
by threatening arrests on grounds of violating compulsory education 
laws 
the mayor denied the charge and said boycott leaders wanted to 
be arrested 
they wanted us to arrest but were not we learned that 
lesson in the 60s smitherman said 
some of the boycotting students were taken by parents or 
demonstration leaders to the first baptist church of selma where 
mrs sanders and others spoke about civil rights history 
roussell who came to selma in 1987 from new orleans said his 
firing was not the real reason for the protests 
this is not about me and its not about the school system 
said roussell its about what happened on the pettus bridge 25 
years ago 
troopers used tear gas and clubs on black marchers in 1965 as 
they crossed the edmund pettus bridge over the alabama river at 
downtown selma the violence helped inspire a march to montgomery 
and later passage of the federal voting rights law 
some blacks also protested roussells termination by withdrawing 
thousands of dollars from two banks with ties to school board 
members but smitherman said the city soon would deposit 500000 
in municipal accounts at each of the two banks

the bush administration declared anew 
wednesday that it wants manuel antonio noriega brought to trial in 
the united states on drugtrafficking charges but declined to rule 
out other options 
under questioning white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
would not rule out the possiblity of an agreement that would send 
the deposed ruler who has been in the vatican embassy in panama 
city since christmas eve to a third country 
fitzwater said as he has in the past that noriegas fate now 
rests largely with the roman catholic church 
i want to make clear from this podium our positon is we want 
him returned to the united states fitzwater said at his daily 
briefing for reporters but he added we will not rule out any 
and every other kind of option 
later the presidential spokesman called news organizations to 
assert that he had not intended to signal a change in us policy 
i did not want to imply any change fitzwater said our 
position is that we want him returned to the united states for 
prosecution there is absolutely no change in our position 
as rumors swirled of an impeding movement of noriega out of his 
refuge fitzwater said just before going home early in the evening 
the white house wont know anything until he comes out the door 
were just watching he declined to say more about talks with 
church officials maintaining its up to the vatican 
another official said the administration had chased two days 
of dry hole rumors about noriegas fate 
administration officials in the past have appeared to reject the 
idea of allowing noriega exile in a third country where he would 
be safe from us prosecution 
last saturday bush speaking to reporters on a houston golf 
course was asked why allowing noreiga to go to a third country a 
course once suggested by the united states if noriega would 
voluntarily leave power was no longer acceptable 
the death of one marine the brutalization of a wife of a 
lieutenant the death of a lot of our kids thats what changed 
and thats why i feel very strongly that were not back to square 
one bush said 
on wednesday fitzwater said 
weve never said no third country what we have said is we 
want him to come back to the united states but we are not going 
to rule out every other alternative 
at the same time fitzwater said a report that noriega may have 
been tipped off in advance of the dec 20 us invasion of panama 
does not appear to be true 
the report which first appeared in fridays editions of the 
washington times suggested noriega may have had 48 hours warning 
of the us action however fitzwater said it seems unlikley 
there was a tipoff in view of all the accounts of his surprise 
that he was having dinner in a restaurant supposedly and drove all 
over town and so forth 
fitzwater asked about reports that the vatican would release 
noriega only if he could be guaranteed that he would receive a fair 
trial and that his life would not be in danger said he will 
receive a fair trial in this country 
and the spokesman added under terms of the indictments he 
is not subject to capital punishment 
noriega could receive up to 145 years in prison and more than 
11 million in fines if he were convicted of drugtrafficking 
charges on indictments handed down in february 1988 in federal 
courts in miami and tampa fla 
meanwhile american and peruvian officials said wednesday that 
peru which pulled out as a participant in an upcoming drug summit 
in colombia to protest the us invasion of panama has reversed 
course and says it will attend the conference 
in another development the envoy designated by panamanian 
president guillermo endara as ambassador to the organization of 
american states lawrence chewning fabrega presented his 
credentials wednesday to oas officials in washington even though 
he was initially rebuffed by the oas 
as of tuesday 11 governments have officially recognized the 
usinstalled endara government and 24 others have indicated 
acceptance by establishing contact with the foreign ministry the 
state department said

the los angeles county board of supervisors 
is an allwhite club that created voting districts with the aim 
of ensuring that hispanics cant join a civil rights lawyer 
charged wednesday 
the countys lawyer denied the charge in opening arguments in a 
federal voting rights lawsuit filed by the us justice department 
the american civil liberties union and the mexican american legal 
defense and educational foundation 
no supervisor had even the slightest intent to discriminate 
against hispanics said attorney john mcdermott 
the lawsuit alleges that the supervisors spread the countys 
large hispanic population across three districts in redrawing 
voting boundaries in 1981 
the move has made it impossible for a hispanic to be elected to 
the board the suit contends even though hispanics make up at 
least 27 percent of the countys 85 million residents a hispanic 
has never been elected to the fivemember board 
each supervisor treated hispanics as pawns strategic means by 
which to hold off the other side the aclus mark rosenbaum 
charged this is an oldfashioned case about racial 
gerrymandering 
mcdermott however said the allegations were based on 
misleading statistical information 
the board is the chief policymaking body and administers 
services in the nations most populous county the supervisors 
each representing more than a million constituents are some of the 
most powerful elected officials in california 
the trial was delayed for several weeks as both sides tried to 
reach an outofcourt settlement us district judge david v 
kenyon said tuesday he would not allow a settlement once the trial 
began 
both parties appeared close to a settlement last month when the 
board of supervisors agreed to redraw supervisor pete schabarums 
district to bring the number of hispanic voters in the area up to 
365 percent the compromise fell apart however when the board 
rejected a counterproposal to increase hispanic voters in the 
district to 494 percent 
the last chance for an outofcourt settlement appeared lost 
tuesday when the board voted 32 against a proposal to expand from 
five to seven members

pascual bonaiutto said he walked 
a mile wednesday searching at every pharmacy along the way for 
sedatives that a month ago most drug stores carried 
in no place could i get what i need said the 58yearold 
waiter from la boca an aged but picturesque buenos aires 
neighborhood i dont want to blame anyone but i feel desperate 
hopeless sick of this country 
shortages price hikes and economic unrest seem to be taking a 
toll on the emotions of argentines who were shocked by food riots 
last may then jarred when inflation topped 196 percent in july and 
jolted anew last month when the economy unraveled even further 
the election of carlos menem as president last may brought hope 
of better times inflation headed down for a change dipping to 
single digits in september and workers were encouraged when real 
wages recovered somewhat 
but the stability proved shortlived 
in recent weeks the slide of the austral against the us 
dollar accelerated prices literally doubled overnight and 
supermarkets became scenes of panicbuying and empty shelves 
clothing boutiques hardware stores travel agencies and other 
businesses seem to have few customers in this capital of 11 million 
residents 
im selling five pairs of shoes a day said omar sanchez 
47 if things continue like this im going to have to close 
then im going to stand in the doorway of government house and 
demand that they give me work 
what analysts said was a lack of public confidence in menems 
plans to privatize the many state industries and deregulate the 
economy touched off a sudden devaluation of the national currency 
the austral 
banks offered interest rates at 600 percent a month to try to 
attract customers converting funds to us dollars a safe haven 
traditionally for moneyed argentines 
after changing his economy minister and central bank president 
last month menem endorsed a new economic plan his fourth so far 
to try again to stabilize the economy 
on new years day economy minister antonio gonzalez restricted 
the amount australs in circulation and banks were ordered closed 
tuesday and wednesday so the population could digest the latest 
austerity measures the banks are set along with foreign exchange 
houses to reopen thursday 
the austral so far has stabilized currency venders on 
streetcorners sold dollars wednesday for about 1800 australs 
apiece equal to last thursday 
the effect of the latest change wont be known until banks open 
and interest and exchange rates both of which have been set by 
supply and demand since dec 10 become public 
for the moment the shortages and price hikes seem containable 
suppliers began resuming shipments wednesday and supermarkets 
agreed to price guidelines on a basket of the basic commodities 
like milk rice noodles and bottled water 
however politicians of both major political parties menems 
laborbased peronist and the radical civil union say they fear 
that by midjanuary social unrest such as food riots may again 
occur some even fear military intervention again the junta last 
ruled argentina from 197683 
said cesar jaroslavsky head of the opposition bloc in the lower 
house of deputies 
there seem to be two clocks functioning one that advances 
slowly on a par with the governments understanding of what is 
happening the other racing ahead of the crisis

thousands of people shouting no 
more and assassin marched wednesday to the vatican embassy 
where gen manuel antonio noriega was closeted with a broken tv 
while his fate was being negotiated 
a crowd estimated at 20000 filled five blocks of avenida balboa 
leading to the embassy us soldiers and tanks at checkpoints kept 
the crowd 150 yards from the embassy gates 
noriega was said to be in strict isolation after monsignor 
sebastian laboa the papal nuncio told his staff not to speak to 
the ousted dictator an embassy spokesman said the television set 
in the room was broken 
panamanian sources said the us southern command was trying to 
convince noriegas longtime mistress to try to lure noriega out the 
embassy 
but the sources who asked not to be further identified said 
vicky amado talked to noriega for 10 minutes after her release from 
a us military facility tuesday and told the deposed strongman 
the decision is in your hands 
in washington the bush administration said after deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger met with panamas new 
leaders that letting noriega go to a third country was an option 
later wednesday however eagleburger said us policy that 
noriega should be sent to florida to face drug trafficking charges 
rather than to a third country had not changed 
we want noriega in the united states period he said 
foreign minister julio linares said panamas constitution did 
not permit the generals extradition to the united states the 
vatican has said it would not deliver noriega directly to the 
united states and would deal with panama 
linares threatened to break diplomatic relations with cuba and 
nicaragua which he said were allies of noriegas military 
dictatorship and had made statements that besmirch the good 
name of panama 
if they continue to harass panama we will be forced to review 
our relations with them he said there is a strong opinion in 
panama that there should be a break in relations 
problems appeared in president guillermo endaras new 
administration col roberto armijo who had been noriegas police 
chief quit as head of the newly created public safety forces 
vice president ricardo arias calderon said the resignation had 
nothing to do with relations between the government and the 
public safety forces 
arias said armijo stepped down after a financial matter that 
deserves an investigation was discovered he did not elaborate 
but said the investigation was under way 
one demonstrator in the avenida balboa crowd held a sign that 
read no mercy in six languages speakers went to a platform and 
shouted no more no more 
vendors sold tshirts that had i survived the us invasion 
on the front and the operations code name just cause in the 
back the demonstrators dispersed without incident at nightfall 
vatican embassy spokesman jose cubillas said two noriega aides 
were very nervous about the military activity around the 
compound which is ringed by barbed wire and dozens of us 
soldiers 
seventeen others are believed to have joined noriega in the 
vatican embassy including lt col nivaldo madrinan director of 
his secret police and capt eliezer gaytan chief of his personal 
security force 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
bush administration was sticking to its position that noriega be 
delivered to us authorities to face drug trafficking charges but 
added we will not rule out any and every other kind of option 
officials said eagleburger had no direct role in negotitions to 
get noriega out of the embassy where he has been closeted for 10 
days but his visit came while a vatican envoy was in panama to 
help with the negotiations 
a delegation led by eagleburger met with endara and other new 
panamanian leaders wednesday to plan american help for economic 
recovery 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee and sen john warner rva the committees ranking 
minority member were in panama to evaluate the us operation 
linares said panama cannot constitutionally and juridically 
extradite noriega to the united states even though endara and 
others have said they would prefer noriega go there rather than to 
a third country where he could make trouble 
armijo was replaced as head of the new security forces by lt 
col eduardo herrera who was military attache in israel at the 
time of the us invasion dec 20 
in an interview tuesday armijo said many of noriegas henchmen 
had eluded capture and had sought asylum in the vatican and other 
embassies 
unexpectedly heavy fighting between pronoriega forces and us 
troops heavily damaged many parts of panama city once a thriving 
commercial and financial hub of 1 million looter plundered 
hundreds of stores of merchandise ranging from food to furniture

the government has announced a 4 
million operation to remove tens of thousands of illegal gold 
miners from the amazon jungle lands of the yanomami indians one of 
the worlds largest primitive tribes 
the operation is a response to an international outcry to 
protect the yanomamis from disease and violence brought by the 
miners said the national indian office in brasilia the capital 
were backed by a presidential decree and humanitarian 
reasons the miners will be removed by force if necessary col 
airton alcantara gomes no 2 at the indian office said in a 
telephone interview 
about 40000 clandestine miners are believed to have invaded 
yanomami lands in the remote northwestern state of roraima near 
brazils border with venezuela some 9000 yanomamis live in the 
region which is rich in gold tin and diamonds 
mining is an evil and not even a necessary evil gomes 
said it pollutes the rivers destroys the rain forest and 
devastates indian tribes the operation is to start sunday with 
the closing of air strips near boa vista the capital of roraima 
only four strips will be kept open for official use he said 
small planes are the main means of bringing in food supplies 
fuel guns alcohol drugs everything well even seize planes if 
necessary gomes said 
about 400 federal police air force and indian office agents 
then will comb the jungle to find and remove prospectors he said 
gomes said government agents expected to face violent resistance 
from some miners instigated by the controllers of the mining sites 
the only ones who profit from gold mining are a half dozen big 
controllers and a few airplane owners the benefit for the country 
is zero because most of the gold is smuggled out he said 
the removal is expected to take 60 days federal police will be 
permanently stationed in the region to prevent miners from 
returning gomes said 
in a separate operation five medical teams from the health 
ministry and the indian office began visiting yanomami villages to 
treat a growing outbreak of disease 
because of the presence of the miners many indians have 
malaria tuberculosis and venereal diseases there also is a lot of 
malnutrition because fish and game have disappeared from some 
areas gomes said 
traveling by helicopter and on foot the medical teams are to 
visit every yanomami village in 45 days and distribute 8140 pounds 
of medicine and supplies he said 
environmental and indian defense groups in november told the 
nations congress that 280 yanomamis had died since 1987 about 70 
percent of the tribal land which originally covered 22 million 
acres has been made into national forests and parks 
defenders of the yanomami cause include british rock star sting 
and indian chief davi kopenawa winner of a united nations global 
500 award in 1988 for defense of the environment 
there are about 220000 native indians left in brazil down from 
an estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by the 
portuguese in 1500

indictment that includes manuel antonio noriega requested separate 
trials wednesday hours before the deposed panamanian leader was 
arrested by us drug agents in panama 
prior to noriegas arrest wednesday night a federal judge 
assigned to the case said he wouldnt rule on the requests until 
later this month and might hold off beginning the trials if 
noriega is extradited to face charges in miami 
at present we have four defendants however if the situation 
in panama should resolve itself in another week and if we have five 
defendants and one of them is general noriega then the whole 
situation changes said us district judge william hoeveler 
later wednesday in washington president bush announced the 
former dictator had turned himself in after nine days inside the 
vatican embassy in panama city and was arrested by drug enforcement 
administration agents at howard air force base in panama 
noriega was put aboard a military transport plane bound for 
homestead air force base in florida and will be arraigned in us 
district court in miami on drug trafficking charges the president 
said if convicted on all charges noriega could be sentenced to 
145 years in prison and fined 11 million

events in panama before and after last months us invasion that 
toppled noriegas government

millions of dollars in bribes from colombias medellin cartel in 
exchange for allowing drug traffickers to use panama as a conduit

crewmen of a navy weapons train that ran 
over a peace activist and cut off his legs cannot sue the victim 
and his fellow demonstrators for causing them emotional distress a 
federal judge said 
in a pretrial ruling released wednesday us district judge 
robert peckham rejected what he called the novel legal theory 
that an injured political protester is responsible for traumatizing 
those who injured him 
he said a reasonable jury could not conclude that the 
protesters acts made it inevitable that the train would run them 
over 
the judge also ruled that evidence that the train was intended 
to scare demonstrators off the tracks may be enough to show a 
violation of their constitutional rights but peckham threw out a 
suit by the injured activist s brian willson against the 
commander of the concord naval weapons station saying the 
commander did not cause the accident 
trial is scheduled april 24 in a suit by willson his wife 
holley rauen and three others against the government the train 
crewmen and two supervisors at the naval station east of san 
francisco 
im sure its a great relief to brian willson and his wife to 
no longer be facing claims that theyre required to compensate the 
crew for emotional distress caused by running over them said 
their chief lawyer thomas steel 
the crewmens lawyer william kolin did not return a telephone 
call 
willson and others opposing us arms shipments to central 
america demonstrated sept 1 1987 at concord station where they 
said the weapons shipments were originating a train from the 
station hit willson as he sat on the tracks severing both legs at 
the knee 
the demonstrators suit seeks damages for violations of the 
rights of free speech and assembly and the right against illegal 
seizure for illsons medical costs and for emotional distress 
the judge also rejected a slander suit by the three civilian 
crewmen against several demonstrators for calling the accident an 
act of attempted murder peckham said the statements were 
expressions of opinion rather than factual assertions

manuel antonio noriega from the vatican embassy in panama city may 
be indirectly complicating the fate of another embassy fugitive a 
world away chinese dissident fang lizhi

so far the united states has shown no more inclination to turn 
fang over to chinese officials who want to arrest him than the

contaminated with potentially harmful drugs but the government

the very nature of suburbia aggravates one 
overriding problem travel this second story in a threepart 
series suburbs crisis of growth looks at suburban drivers 
increasing difficulties in simply getting around

housing tracts are blowing away the 
sagebrush out here in the mojave desert and the legends of the old 
west are being supplanted by those of a new one 
meet the new riders of the purple sage 
the motorcyclist who commutes 170 miles across the los angeles 
basin each day 
the highway patrolman who drives 90 minutes each morning to 
east los angeles where he spends the day riding around in a 
cruiser 
the defense plant worker who exhausted by the fourhour daily 
odyssey between home and job spends the night in his car in the 
company parking lot 
a long harrowing trip to and from work is no longer remarkable 
in the new suburban metropolis it is merely the price that must be 
paid for a single family house and the price is always going up 
as traffic bogs down more of the time and homes pop up ever 
farther from jobs the logistics of suburban travel are breaking 
down in greater la for example almost every hour is rush hour 
and an estimated 84000 hours a day are lost in traffic jams 
some of those hours belong to mary mckeon 31 whose desire for 
a new threebedroom twobath house on a halfacre brought her to 
this community in the high desert east of los angeles 
the stars are still blinking when she begins the twohour 
morning drive across the desert through the mountain pass and down 
to her office in the city 
for 45 minutes she zips along at 70 but traffic moves fitfully 
after she hits i10 so mary listens to her favorite country and 
western station and dreams of the days when six minutes were all 
that separated her job and her familys apartment 
she misses the time others spend at home my daughters are 
having to learn to cook without me and my husband and i have to 
eat it she laughs but you have to give something to get 
something 
what she gets is a home in a relaxed casual community largely 
free of crime racial tension and air pollution i like to be 
able to see the stars at night she says 
ms mckeon works four 10hour days a week managing a law office 
on monday i feel great she says on thursday i feel like 
hell 
in winter she must leave an hour earlier 4 am you never 
know if therell be snow in the pass she explains 
wherever times are good traffic is bad from route 1 near 
princeton nj to route 101 in silicon valley residents of 
orange county in southern california must cope with orange 
crush the impromptu parking lot that forms every rush hour at 
the confluence of three freeways 
the problem is the car and the lack of alternatives to it 
a fifth of all walks to work and a third of all public transit 
trips occur in greater new york elsewhere especially in the 
sunbelt metropolises suburbia is so spread out that most people 
cannot walk to most destinations even when distances are walkable 
there often is no sidewalk 
the suburban motorists view of mass transit useful only 
insofar as it gets other drivers off the road is not irrational 
as many as half of todays suburban drivers once took mass 
transit they know rail and bus routes are not flexible enough for 
lowrise decentralized areas areas like suburban houston where 
secretary nancy keelers trip home from work might also include 
stops at her sons day care center the supermarket the post 
office and the video store 
when she lived in chicago she used to ride the bus to work and 
walk almost everywhere else asked if she could do that now she 
just laughs 
nor can the subway or train replace the car a study of office 
workers near the walnut creek station of the bay area rapid transit 
system in northern california found that only a handful used mass 
transit bart ran to the office but not to their widely dispersed 
homes 
in new jersey the most suburban state most mass transit lines 
still run into new york city or philadelphia even though a 
majority of residents now work instate 
for 28 years william wright took the train from his home in 
cranford nj to his office in manhattan a 40minute ride then 
his company moved to fort lee nj two years ago finally uniting 
his home and job on the same side of the hudson 
but wright a mass transit buff did not want to start driving 
so he commuted through manhattan via train subway and bus a 
twohour trip each way after nine months of that he quit his job 
wrights case illustrates not only the limits of mass transit 
but the tendency for jobs and homes to spread out as the suburban 
metropolis expands 
those who can afford to live in jobrich suburbs such as orange 
county or fairfield county conn can enjoy relatively short 
drives but since these areas may have six or seven times more jobs 
than residents many workers must commute from farflung bedroom 
suburbs 
average oneway commuting times which held remarkably steady 
from 1950 to 1980 are increasing exact figures must await the 
1990 census but between 1980 and 1985 the number of automobiles in 
metropolitan areas increased between 10 and 15 percent while road 
capacity increased only 1 to 2 percent 
as a result the rush hour has expanded to include vast swaths 
of the day trapping commuters in their cars and curbing the sense 
of spaciousness and freedom on which suburbia is based 
by one estimate each suburban car requires six parking spaces 
at home work and church as well as the club the store and the 
park 
but the greatest space consumer is the home building industry 
which each year covers thousands of acres of farmland or other open 
space with single family homes and yards 
developers in northern new jersey are buying up boy scout camps 
and neighborhood swimming holes in south florida they have 
reached the edge of the everglades 
over the past few years neal alper has seen the drive between 
his business in miami beach and his suburban dade county home 
stretch from 45 minutes to more than an hour usually he misses 
half of his sons little league game 
jane minelli is an elementary school teacher by training but 
these days as she shuttles her two children to various schools 
lessons and appointments on the outskirts of phoenix she feels 
more like a chauffeur all i need is the uniform she says 
architect daniel solomon recalls the night he was supposed to 
drive from malibu to los angeles international airport but was told 
by his hosts that he couldnt use the freeway even at 10 pm it 
was too crowded

they gather at dawn standing in small groups at bus stops or 
corners waiting for their ride jesse jackson sums up their 
working life in five words they take the early bus 
they are the long distance commuters of the working class the 
thousands of city residents who haul themselves out to suburbia 
because that is the only place they can get a decent job 
joyce johnson 50 lives in southeastern atlanta and works as a 
clerk at a pharmacy in a shopping center north of the city its a 
40minute drive but mrs johnson doesnt own a car instead she 
has to take a two different buses because there is no direct 
service she rises before dawn to catch the 630 bus to be sure of 
arriving on time for the stores 8 am opening 
although the number of vehicles on the roads of greater atlanta 
has doubled in the past five years commuting times have remained 
fairly constant because employers have moved closer to suburban 
residents 
that dont help me she sighs 
even exclusive old railroad suburbs had areas near the station 
where servants and other workers could live but in an attempt to 
secure privacy and security in an increasingly dense suburban 
fabric many expensive new residential communities and the most 
prosperous business centers are built out of reach of those most in 
need of housing and jobs 
many new suburbs are designed to make sure residents live only 
with other people like themselves in a sort of residential dating 
service developers and realestate agents match elderly with 
elderly singles with singles families with families tennis 
players with tennis players 
since there is no place for the poor and inadequate public 
transportation these communities lack hands to flip burgers mow 
lawns wash cars this labor shortage is advertised in a million 
store windows help wanted 
some communities drop all pretenses of pluralism and resort to 
walls gates and moats 
last year residents of miami shores fla voted to raise 
property taxes to barricade the community to through traffic and 
hopefully criminals an even more extreme example is atlantis a 
walled gated and guarded community in palm beach county that hired 
a former secret service agent as its manager 
but money is the most effective barrier to suburbia a 
singlefamily home is becoming so expensive that even the children 
of the middle class are finding admission prohibitive 
suburbs designed to solve the housing problem now are part of 
it when william levitt began building the first of 17000 houses 
on long island in 1948 the nation faced the worst housing shortage 
before or since 
gis men who saved the nation from hitler only to find 
themselves sleeping on inlaws couches under cars and in chicken 
coops lined up overnight to buy houses for 65 a month and 
nothing down 
today the federal subsidies that built levittown are gone and 
the towns average house price around 160000 is low only in 
comparison to prices in other new york suburbs 
when daphyne rus and her family moved to levittown in 1959 they 
were able to get a threebedroom house with only 400 down but 
when her own son was ready to move out years later he had to rent 
a room from her for several years before he could afford a place of 
his own 
levittown was very good to us says mrs rus i really 
feel for young people today they need another levitt

the real estate agent told george powell 
that the owner of the fourbedroom twobath house on which he had 
made a bid was taking it off the market 
powell a philip morris executive with a wife and three 
children was suspicious for two reasons he was black and the 
owner was dead 
welcome to the suburbs mr powell 
but george powell was the exception he fought back he sued 
the real estate agent a local openhousing group picketed outside 
the house and finally the powells became teaneck residents 
that was 20 years ago today powell still is exceptional he 
lives on an integrated street in an integrated suburban community 
an environment still beyond the reach of most black americans 
the exclusion of blacks was part of the foundation of american 
suburbia leases for houses at levittown ny the largest and 
most famous postwar suburb limited occupants to members of the 
caucasian race 
if he sold to blacks william levitt insisted whites wouldnt 
buy it was a question of economics he later said we cant 
take on the functions of the government 
although 12 percent of americans are black only six percent of 
suburbanites are black 
but between 1970 and 1980 the last decade for which statistics 
are available the black share of suburban population increased 40 
percent some of the nations most famous suburbs including oak 
park and park forest ill and shaker heights ohio have growing 
black communities 
purdue sociologist john stahura says blacks are suburbanizing 
at a faster pace than whites theres a pentup black demand for 
suburban housing 
however stahura says most blacks wind up in older larger and 
poorer innerring communities that often seem more urban than 
suburban an extreme example is ford heights a predominantly black 
community of 5300 south of chicago 
ford heights always was more industrial than residential and 
when industry left unemployment soared over 50 percent an annual 
per capita income of 4943 makes ford heights the nations poorest 
suburb according to one survey 
the town has sought to attract the kinds of employers most 
suburbs fight to keep out a fireworks factory a state prison a 
garbage incinerator 
despite such poverty pockets suburban blacks generally enjoy a 
higher standard of living than their city counterparts there is 
one constant however segregation 
blockbyblock studies have shown that suburbs are just as 
segregated as central cities twentyfive of the nations 300 
largest metro areas contain about threefifths of all black 
suburbanites 
moreover history suggests that an integrated suburb is 
really an allwhite suburb in the process of becoming an allblack 
suburb 
although oak park and shaker heights have devised intricate 
strategies to maintain a racial balance they are doomed to fail 
stahura predicts both he says are surrounded by predominantly 
black communities and will become black middleclass communities 
themselves 
so far this has not happened in teaneck a town of 37000 near 
the bridge that links northern new jersey and new york city the 
median house price is around 260000 and the racial mix 64 
percent white 24 percent black the rest asian hispanic and 
others approximates that of greater new york 
teaneck prides itself on its racial and ethnic diversity a 
former mayor who is black calls it a community of 
communities this tradition dates at least to 1954 when the army 
designated teaneck which had several black families as a model 
town worthy of emulation by the subjugated germans and japanese 
when increasing numbers of blacks started moving into the 
northeastern corner some white homeowners sold quickly but other 
whites rallied they posted not for sale signs and passed an 
ordinance to stop real estate agents from stampeding homeowners 
into selling in 1964 teaneck became the first community in the 
nation to use busing to voluntarily integrate its schools 
but even in teaneck there is a limit to integration 
george powell says he often finds himself the only black at a 
wedding or funeral and his contact with most of his neighbors 
extends only to an occasional wave 
there is educational integration and there is residential 
integration but there isnt social integration he says 
there are two separate societies he adds its a matter 
of choice the races work together and live together but dont 
play together

this final part of the series suburbs crisis 
of growth looks to the suburban future where some see less 
sprawl and fewer cars 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thirty years ago robert e simon was just 
another frustrated commuter with an old american dream to live and 
work in a place with the spark of the city and the spirit of the 
country 
this frustrated commuter however was also the owner of 
carnegie hall so he sold it and used some of the proceeds to buy 
a farm 20 miles west of washington here in 1962 he started to 
build his rebuttal to the web of highways houses and shopping 
centers that had begun to cover fairfax county va and much of 
the rest of america 
reston its name derived from simons initials was designed 
to recreate the excitement and diversity of manhattans 57th street 
in a peaceful bucolic setting 
but instead of changing the sprawling suburban landscape reston 
became part of it it was a community of 50000 with lots of trees 
homes and playgrounds offices and stores and streets with names 
like gallant fox court but little urbanity and no center 
now drawing on an unexecuted part of simons original plan the 
nations most famous new town is finally getting a downtown a 
real urban core complete with a grid of streets and sidewalks a 
public square and office buildings is being carved out of the 
woods 
the same notion is catching on across the nation replace or at 
least modify suburban sprawl with compact walkable settlements 
that mix homes and businesses in a way that gets people out of 
their cars and back in touch with each other 
this comes at a time when residents of many of the nations most 
affluent suburban areas are revolting against growth 
fairfax county for instance has more offices and stores than 
most major cities but success has been accompanied by a feeling 
that paradise is getting too crowded prodevelopment officials 
have been voted out and in neighboring loudon county the most 
popular bumper sticker is dont fairfax loudon 
the obvious solution no growth or at least slower growth has 
been popular wherever suburbias economic boom threatens the clean 
quiet spacious life that attracted people in the first place 
these wellintentioned movements have just one flaw according 
to ucalriverside political scientist max neiman they dont work 
developers always find another community that wants the business 
and sometimes its the one next door 
is there no alternative to more sprawl and traffic 
no commuters might as well make the best of the inevitable 
urges anthony downs of the brookings institution get a 
comfortable airconditioned car and equip it with a stereo radio 
tape deck telephone and dictaphone share your long ride with 
someone you really like 
his point as long as people live in houses with big yards and 
drive long distances alone to work traffic congestion will be the 
only way to reconcile the competing desires of thousands of 
people to travel to the same destinations over the same roads at 
the same time 
a rival scheme build more roads has an undeniable logic but 
widening congested highways often produces nothing more than wider 
congested highways and who will pay for them the federally 
financed interstate highway system is 98 percent built and 
congress has not approved any additions to it in eight years 
that leaves the third alternative build new suburbs like old 
towns 
the newest idea in planning miami architect andres duany is 
fond of saying is the 19th century town 
when asked if they would prefer to live in a city suburb farm 
or small town americans invariably choose the latter duany plays 
on these fond if hazy impressions of small town life to sell 
denser more urbane suburbs with tight grids of streets and 
squares that bring homes offices stores and recreation areas 
closer together 
the 39yearold architect sits in his office and between sips 
of strong sweet cuban coffee explains where the suburbs went 
wrong 
centuries of town planning went out of style after world war ii 
americans were tired of life in the crowded dirty industrial 
city and suddenly a confluence of cheap money land gas cars and 
highways allowed them to escape 
suburbia exploded in scale to the point where in the expansive 
new communities of the south and southwest people must climb into 
a car to do almost everything duany says making matters worse 
many of these newer suburbs are designed like giant culdesacs 
with only a few entranceexits which dump all traffic onto a 
throughroute creating traffic jams 
perhaps the best example of new town planning is seaside fla 
a resort hamlet where duany and his architect wife elizabeth 
platerzyberk have tried to recreate an oldfashioned southern 
community using a strict building code 
their real ambition though is to take the elements of suburbia 
the shopping mall the culdesac the vast parking lot and 
reform them in a way that will allow suburban regions to grow not 
by spreading out but by becoming more densely settled 
the south and southwest 
have banded together to rezone their land and sell it as one parcel 
to a developer who can then tear down the homes and erect 
apartment houses stores or office buildings 
greater atlanta is the neighborhood buyout capital with more 
than 40 proposed or completed the largest occurred in the lake 
hearn area where a developer bought a parcel that included 140 
homes which he promptly razed the deal went through only after 
the residents won a court battle with county officials who had 
refused to rezone their subdivision 
but in golfviews case marvels anthony catanese a university 
of florida professor who has studied neighborhood buyouts an 
actual government has said were for sale thats 
extraordinary 
so was golfviews situation founded in the 1930s on part of a 
golf course golfview was country until an adjacent strip of 
asphalt called morrison field became morrison air force base which 
in turn became palm beach international airport 
today golfview finds itself encircled by noisy runways and 
increasingly congested highways there is no golf and no view 
other than the underside of 737s 
the idea of a buyout came up four years ago at a neighborhood 
cocktail party al cone a lawyer who had spent 10000 
soundproofing his house remarked that golfviews location had 
lowered its residential value but increased its commercial value 
after months of discussion homeowners signed an agreement to 
sell their 64 acres en masse to a developer and the town council 
promised to rezone the property a real estate firm was retained to 
market the town and sales brochures were printed to advertise a 
strategic location at the northwest corner of the airport 
the homeowners are asking 35 million which would pay them at 
least two times the residential market value of their houses which 
ranges from 150000 to 300000 the proceeds will be divided up 
through a complicated formula designed to reflect both the 
condition of the houses and lot size 
where will everyone go people here like their freedom and 
privacy says ms yount the town manager theyll probably go 
further west to other developments with the city following 
steadily behind 
there is however one holdout the elderly nearly blind neva 
brockway who arrived in the 1930s raised a family here and says 
i always thought id finish my life out here 
she seems resigned to moving but her family has not signed the 
agreement cone says they just dont want to worry her and are 
expected to cooperate when a sale date nears 
in florida a state that gains about 900 new residents a day 
golfview also offers a reminder that nothing lasts forever 
i like where i live says cone but everything in life is 
for sale except your honor and your health

in any financial season few strategies for 
longterm savings have as many enthusiastic advocates as the system 
known as dollar cost averaging 
it provides for discipline and order in a chaotic world it 
takes the guesswork out of timing the ups and downs of stocks and 
interestbearing investments 
its especially well suited for littlebylittle investors who 
dont see much chance of inheriting wealth or staging their own 
personal corporate takeovers any time soon 
by a quirk of arithmetic it allows you to buy almost any type 
of readily tradeable investment at less than its average price over 
a period of time what more could anyone want 
by all means go for it most any expert would reply but before 
you do recognize that even this timehonored idea isnt a certain 
path to wealth 
dollarcost averaging is so named because it involves regular 
investments whether weekly monthly quarterly or even yearly 
of fixed amounts of money in a security such as a mutual fund 
suppose you decide to put 500 on the last day of each calendar 
quarter into shares of the no guts no glory fund which specializes 
in highrisk markets seeking maximum capital gains 
on march 31 with the funds net asset value per share at 25 
your 500 buys 20 shares three months later when the fund stands 
at 20 you add 25 shares to your account 
on sept 30 with the pershare value down to 15 you purchase 
3333 shares by yearend the net asset value is back at 20 and 
you buy another 25 shares 
through the year the funds asset value has averaged out to 
20 but because your money bought more shares at low prices you 
now own 10333 shares which at 20 each are worth 206660 or 
6660 more than you paid for them 
the longer you do this and the greater the fluctuations in the 
funds price the more this effect works in your favor it demands 
persistence however as well as faith in the fund you have chosen 
and the longterm prospects for the types of securities the fund 
owns 
dollar averaging serves as an antidote to the natural human 
tendency to buy high when everything looks rosy and sell low 
when it looks like civilization is coming apart 
as christopher downey an analyst at prescott ball amp turben 
inc in cleveland put it most investors who obtain poor returns 
in the market are victims of their own emotions 
but sticking with a dollar averaging plan may not turn out to be 
as easy as it looks the more shares of no guts no glory you 
accumulate the more you will have to stick with your convictions 
when its price declines for extended periods 
in fact there is always a chance that any fears you have of 
throwing good money after bad may prove justified 
if after 25 years of your averaging program the no guts no glory 
fund bogs down at around 150 a share its operating philosophy 
discredited once and for all you may have to conclude that your 
plan just hasnt worked out a lot of the money and all of the time 
you entrusted to it is gone 
of course that risk exists to some degree in almost any type of 
investment even government securities which can be ravaged by 
inflation if dollar averaging cant make you a certain winner 
advisers say it can certainly improve your odds

an airline passengers group has praised 
northwest airlines for acknowledging a bomb threat last week and 
giving passengers the option of canceling their reservations 
more than 100 travelers gave up bookings on saturdays flight 51 
from paris to detroit the dc10 with a capacity of 284 
passengers arrived safely in detroit with 22 passengers on board 
the virginiabased airline passengers association wrote 
northwest president alfred checchi to express appreciation and 
support for the airlines decision to publicly discuss the threat 
and give passengers the option of taking other flights said 
association head richard livingston 
we just felt that the action by northwest was a refreshing 
change of attitude on the part of the industry livingston said 
tuesday 
the independent consumers group funded by its 110000 
frequentflyer members believes passengers have a right to know of 
any credible threat against planes for which they have 
reservations he said 
the northwest threat acknowledged by the airline after a 
swedish newspaper reported it led to increased security on the 
flight and several others in europe over the weekend 
livingston said the airlines decision to acknowledge the threat 
two days before the flight gave passengers the opportunity to make 
other plans other security threats have been disclosed only as 
passengers are about to board the plane he said 
the airline allowed passengers to make other reservations 
without penalty even if they held discount tickets with refund and 
flightchange restrictions

international business machines corp will 
announce this year a new personal computer system for use in 
trucks aircraft ships and cars for mobile satellite 
communications an industry research company said 
ibm declined to comment on the report tuesday by gartner group 
inc said ibm spokesman james keller 
ibm sees this market as one of the great growth areas for 
pcs said gartner analyst john pemberton 
gartner predicts that sales of computers for use in mobile 
satellite operations will reach 4 billion in 1995 compared with 
50 million in 1989 
such a level of compound annual growth 150 percent would 
exceed the more than 50 percent growth rate of personal computers 
from 1981 to 1986 said gartner which is based in stamford conn 
almost any industry needs mss mobile satellite systems to 
control field operations for constant location and status 
information on trucks trains airplanes oil rigs and piplines 
pemberton said in a statement 
the recent development of small mobile satellite stations 
costing only 4000 makes satellite communications systems 
affordable for wide use gartner says previously the least 
expensive satellite terminals cost 15000 or more 
with a satellite system a delivery company for example could 
receive information directly from its truck drivers on pickups 
traffic delays etc without the need for drivers to stop to make 
a phone call such information would be entered into a personal 
computer housed in the truck 
gartner said the new computers will be used with radio 
determination satellite services a mobile satellite system 
produced by geostar corp of washington dc geostar has a 
business partnership with ibm

bank lenders for campeau corps department 
stores have offered a stopgap measure by agreeing to wait two weeks 
before deciding whether the stores are in default in 234 billion 
in loans 
a group of banks led by citibank of new york have agreed to wait 
until jan 15 before trying to enforce their contention that 
campeaus federated department stores inc and allied stores corp 
are in default the retailers said tuesday 
federated said that under the agreement it would prepay a 250 
million loan due april 30 allied in a separate statement said it 
would have members of a committee considering campeaus 
restructuring meet with bankers by jan 11 
what it means to me is that the bankers are essentially giving 
allied and federated two more weeks of grace to satisfy some very 
stringent conditions said analyst janet mangano of josephthal amp 
co a new york brokerage 
the bankers can come knocking at their doors two weeks from 
now to demand repayment ms mangano said 
citibank warned dec 21 that it considered federated and allied 
in technical default on 234 billion owed to the lenders citibank 
said the banks would consider demanding early repayment unless the 
cincinnatibased retailers could prove solvency by dec 31 
federated and allied disagreed with the banks over whether they 
were in default on the loans the agreement announced tuesday 
preserves the banks right to assert default while campeau 
maintains the right to contest that a default exists 
torontobased campeau which owns 258 stores took on heavy debt 
during the 1988 purchase of federated for 67 billion its stores 
are considered profitable but much of campeaus debt is in 
highinterest junk bonds 
federated said it would repay its loan with money from an 
account that was part of a mortgage agreement the account would be 
replenished by any possible asset sales federated said 
federated has been trying since last year to sell its upscale 
bloomingdales chain to raise cash 
allied which campeau bought in 1986 hasnt offered to sell any 
assets or promised to take any other actions said dixie barker a 
campeau spokeswoman 
nothing is active at this point ms barker said theres 
nothing going on right now other than the bloomingdale asset sale 
allied and federated warned in a dec 12 filing with the 
securities and exchange commission that they may be forced to file 
for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy 
code if lenders do not reschedule their debt 
many of campeaus suppliers have said they wont ship spring 
merchandise to campeaus stores until the companys financial 
situation improves spring merchandise isnt scheduled to be 
shipped until about jan 10 suppliers say 
federated reported that it lost 706 million for the quarter 
ended oct 28 and allied reported a 362 million loss for the 
same period 
campeaus main creditor olympia amp york developments ltd in 
toronto has been negotiating with the companys bondholders to try 
to reduce interest payments on the bonds

car and truck sales took another tumble in 
middecember falling 186 percent from a busy selling period a 
year before automakers say 
consumers stormed showrooms at the end of 1988 to take advantage 
of attractive incentive packages that raid pushed mid and 
latedecember vehicle sales rates to among the highest of 1988 
making yeartoyear comparisons difficult 
however analysts said the market slump that began in october 
continued into middecember of 1989 
the eight major automakers with us plants said tuesday they 
sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 28417 
during the dec 1120 period last year compared with a rate of 
34921 during the same time the year before 
car sales were down 213 percent and sales of light trucks fell 
14 percent 
incentives were in effect during the month in 1989 but they 
werent working the same kind of charm as they did a year earlier 
the problem is youve got a tired market said auto analyst 
joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
youre facing a market thats at least partially saturated 
since 1985 more than 77 million new cars and trucks have been 
sold in the united states or about one for every three americans 
theyve bought so many cars over the past five or six years 
and they are still paying for them said analyst mary anne sudol 
of fitch investors service inc in new york 
it was difficult tuesday to pinpoint how much of the 
yeartoyear decline in middecember sales figures was due to 
industry weakness and how much was colored by the hefty sales 
figures during the period in 1988 
i think its pretty weak right now sudol said 
with just one 10day sales period left in 1989 car and truck 
sales for the eight automakers were running 37 percent behind the 
pace in 1988 domestic and overseas automakers report their 
endoftheyear sales figures thursday 
car sales for 1989 through dec 20 were running 48 percent 
behind 1988s level and truck sales were down 16 percent 
among the big three fords middecember combined car and truck 
sales dropped the most falling 252 percent from a year ago 
fords car sales were off 332 percent and light truck sales were 
down 122 percent 
chryslers vehicle sales for middecember were down 228 
percent with car sales falling 337 percent and light truck sales 
dropping 113 percent 
at gm car and truck sales fell 195 percent in middecember 
last year compared with a year ago car sales fell 216 percent and

injunction to halt the tender offer on the grounds that it would

more than 70 percent of japanese business leaders 
polled last month said usjapan relations would deteriorate 
unless measures were taken now a major japanese newspaper reported 
wednesday 
when the 100 executives in the poll were asked to suggest two 
remedies more than 90 percent mentioned boosting japanese domestic 
demand and narrowing the us trade deficit said the nationally 
circulated mainichi shimbun higher domestic demand here means 
japanese would buy more foreign products and rely less on exports 
for economic growth 
the paper said 23 percent felt the imbalance could be solved by 
making the yen higher against the us dollar which makes us 
goods less expensive here and japanese goods costlier in the united 
states 
among the 100 executives interviewed between dec 6 and 26 were 
sony president norio oga yutaka kume of nissan motor co and 
hiroshi saito of japan steel the paper said in publishing their 
comments however it identified the speaker only by industry and 
not by name 
it said 73 warned of relations worsening unless remedial steps 
are taken 
if ussoviet relations improve the united states will be 
harder on japan and japanbashing will worsen unidentified 
real estate and textile executives were quoted as saying 
a securities firm president told the mainichi that japan should 
open its doors to encourage foreign companies direct investment 
here 
but the paper quoted an auto company president as saying to 
be honest it is almost impossible to correct the usjapan trade 
imbalances 
a real estate company president said the imbalance would shrink 
by itself in the long run if the two sides strengthened their 
cooperation 
asked what japanese companies should do to avoid friction in 
investment in the united states 82 executives said companies would 
have to study each case because in many cases japanese investment 
is welcomed 
last year the japanese became the no 2 foreign investor behind 
the british in the united states and some purchases such as 
rockefeller center by mitsubishi estate co and the columbia film 
studios by sony upset americans

japans tokyu department store said wednesday it 
has decided not to join in a proposed management buyout of the 
wellknown us department store chain bloomingdales 
the decision came late last year after a series of studies and 
contacts with bloomingdales said a tokyu official speaking on 
condition of anonymity he added that tokyu has been in agreement 
with bloomingdales not to give out details concerning the buyout 
proposal and negotiations 
the new yorkbased bloomingdales is owned by heavily indebted 
campeau corp a canadian retail and real estate company that owns 
strings of department store chains in the united states campeau 
put the 17store bloomingdales chain on the auction block in 
september as part of a restructuring plan to cope with a financial 
crisis 
in november bloomingdales chairman marvin traub visited tokyo 
and said he had been negotiating with four japanese groups about 
backing the management buyout he did not identify the four 
the hankyu department store based in osaka western japan has 
said it turned down an offer from traub earlier 
the nihon keizai shimbun japans leading economic newspaper 
reported that traub had asked hankyu to finance 250 million of the 
12 billion to 13 billion needed for the buyout 
campeau has said the list of interested parties has been 
narrowed to about a half dozen and that an announcement on the sale 
of bloomingdales would be made sometime in february 
the nationally circulated englishlanguage newspaper asahi 
evening news said tokyu decided not to join in the proposed buyout 
because the price sought by campeau was too high considering 
bloomingdales declining business performance 
tokyu would have to spend about 200 million to return the 
store to a sound financial position in addition to the purchase 
price asahi quoted unidentified sources in the japanese company 
as saying 
campeau has debts in high interest bearing junk bonds that 
were sold to finance the 1988 67 billion takeover of federated 
department stores inc parent of bloomingdales 
its allied stores corp and federated divisions both based in 
cincinnati had warned in a dec 12 filing with the us securities 
and exchange commission that they might have to seek protection 
from creditors in bankruptcy court if lenders did not reschedule 
their junkbond debt 
on tuesday the retailers received a twoweek reprieve from a 
bank lenders who had threatened to declare allied and federated in 
technical default on loans of 234 billion and to demand full 
repayment 
the banking syndicate led by citibank agreed not to enforce the 
default assertion before jan 15 giving campeau more time to show 
it is making progress in sorting out its financial problems 
unlike their counterparts in the united states where retailing 
has been in the doldrums and a number of famous department store 
chains are for sale japanese department stores have been growing 
steadily as consumers buying power increases

said 
faigan said shearson has no current plans to name a new 
president and chief operating officer he refused to comment on 
lanes resignation only to say he left for personal reasons 
however in an interview in todays wall street journal lane 
conceded that many in the financial community saw him as the 
scapegoat for shearsons problems which included slumping profits 
and a threatened downgrading of its credit rating by moodys 
investors service inc 
lane said he also was being unfairly blamed for much of the 
problems at boston co a moneymanagement unit hit by a major 
accounting scandal in 1988 and balcor co a real estate unit that 
was partly behind shearsons problems with limited partnership 
invesments 
a lot of people arent surprised im leaving he told the 
newspaper but i feel like a great weight has been removed from 
my shoulders 
lane said he had no immediate future plans 
lane joined a shearson predecessor cogan berlind weil amp 
levitt in 1969 as a securities analyst and rose steadily through 
the ranks until last year

mediators urging 
mediator ben youtsey of the federal mediation and conciliation 
service said tuesday that both sides agreed to a new meeting at his 
request 
the seattle professional engineering employees association 
speea turned down boeings threeyear contract offer on dec 18 
but did not sanction a strike 
boeing had offered 15000 engineers a 3 percent general wage 
increase and a 10 percent bonus in the first year but no wage 
increase or bonuses in the second or third year it also offered 
some meritbased wage increases 
the engineers voted 69 percent to turn the offer down but only 
48 percent said they would be willing to strike 
many engineers noted the offer was not equal to the package 
given to boeing machinists following their sevenweek strike in 
november or to the offer made to speeas bargaining unit for 
technicians the technicians approved their contract by 65 percent 
it was the first time since speea was founded in 1945 that the 
engineers rejected a contract offer the engineers have never 
struck the company 
theres not an awful lot to talk about money is the issue 
said speea spokesman dan mahoney 
he declined to speculate on the likelihood of a strike 
boeing spokesman paul binder did not comment tuesday on whether 
boeing would offer the engineers more money

the regulator who called for the governments 
takeover of lincoln savings and loan association last april today 
defended his assertion that the nowdefunct thrift provided the 
down payment for the sale of 1000 acres of its own land in 
violation of the law 
kevin oconnell a deputy director of the treasury departments 
office of thrift supervision testified in us district court that 
he could not specifically identify the 35 million 25 percent 
down payment that the government asserts lincoln lent to phoenix 
developer ernest c garcia for the 14 million purchase on march 
30 1987 
but oconnell asserted that the loan was linked to another 202 
million loan that garcia obtained from the sampl on the same day to 
repurchase stock he had sold over the previous two years to tucson 
electric power co 
attorneys for lincoln of irvine calif and its embattled 
former owner phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr cited 
documents of wire transfers of 196 million from lincoln to tucson 
electric power as evidence that proceeds from the stock loan were 
not used for the down payment 
oconnell however cited several other transactions among 
garcia lincoln and the thrifts parent company american 
continental corp he said his office believed the stock and land 
deals were directly connected because garcia had said so in a 
deposition with the securities and exchange commission 
im saying that the case is fungible interchangeable and 
that is the basis of the recommendation to seize control of 
lincoln oconnell testified 
if the down payment had not had to be made mr garcia would 
have had to borrow the full 202 million the same cash cannot be 
identified but that was the intent 
lincoln had purchased the land just two years earlier for 3 
million the government contends that through such land sales 
many of them shams lincoln was able to record phony profits that 
allowed keating and his associates to effectively loot the thrift 
of federally insured deposits 
under federal regulations thrifts were required to make 
purchasers of land from the institution put up at least a 25 
percent down payment on raw land purchases in order to record a 
profit 
meanwhile garcia a key witness for the government in its case 
that lincoln was being operated in an unsafe and unsound 
manner is refusing to testify 
regulators estimate taxpayers will have to pay up to 2 billion 
to cover lincolns loss of federally insured deposits through sham 
land transactions fraud and racketeering 
keating contending lincoln was being operated soundly and in 
accord with regulatory requirements has asked us district judge 
stanley sporkin to overturn the governments seizure of the thrift 
as capricious and arbitrary 
keating and his son charles h keating iii have been 
subpoenaed as witnesses and are expected to be called to the stand 
thursday or friday government attorneys said tuesday 
the elder keating who is the target of a criminal grand jury 
investigation in los angeles cited his constitutional rights in 
refusing to answer questions in a subpoenaed appearance in november 
before the house banking committee 
on tuesday the third day of a hearing in keatings suit his 
attorneys attempted to point out gaps in the 4000page record that 
regulators compiled to justify their takeover of lincoln 
oconnell acknowledged in crossexamination that some documents 
outlining the details and regulators approval of a tax arrangement 
and the transactions between lincoln and garcia were omitted from 
the record submitted to the threemember bank board in april 
oconnell testified in december that the taxsharing arrangement 
between lincoln and its parent company american continental corp 
of phoenix was illegal on its face and amounted to nothing 
more than an interestfree loan from the thrift to its holding 
company in violation of the law 
as a loan the government contends american continental would 
have had to pay an estimated 20 million in interest to lincoln 
using the tax agreement the government claims keating and his 
associates funneled 94 million in federally insured deposits out 
of lincoln as deferred taxes much of it on phony profits from sham 
land deals 
none of the money was paid to the internal revenue service and 
regulators say they have been unable to recover any of it because 
american continental filed for bankruptcy reorganization a day 
before lincoln was seized 
oconnell testified tuesday that a 140page deposition garcia 
gave the securities and exchange commission in march was the 
smoking gun that bank board attorneys wanted to justify the 
takeover of lincoln without first declaring it insolvent 
garcia told the sec he used his own funds rather than lincolns 
loan to make the down payment on the land purchase from lincoln 
but he added we never were certain whether or not we would have 
gotten the financing for the stock purchase if we had not bought 
the property 
keating also is the target of a 11 billion federal fraud and 
racketeering suit 
until last week the 11 defendants in that suit also included 
keatings brother william j keating a former twoterm republican 
congressman who is chief executive officer of the detroit newspaper 
agency and chairman of the board of directors of the associated 
press 
on friday federal attorneys dismissed charges against william 
keating who had been accused of negligence and breach of fiduciary 
duty as a board member of american continental during 1986

the advertising agency lord einstein oneill amp 
partners has lost its biggest client saabscania of america inc 
over what both sides describe as creative and philosophical 
differences 
the decision to terminate was mutually agreed upn 
saabscania spokeswoman karin nobile said wednesday by telephone 
from the companys offives in orange conn there were longterm 
creative differences and differences over philosophical strategies 
between both partners 
saabscania spent an estimated 25 million on advertising 
through lord einstien whose total ad billings amount to about 100 
million 
but arthur einstein jr president and partner in the ad agency 
said wednesday there were no plans to lay off any of the agencys 
90some employees due to the loss of its biggest client 
he noted the agency would continue to service the saab account 
until the end of march a 90day grace period that is standard in 
the advertising business 
in addition he said the agency is involved in several new 
business pitches that potentially could involve ad spending worth 
more than the lost business 
we have a lot going on around here we are disappointed but we 
are not by any means looking at the future as anything other than 
bright at this agency einstein said 
he blamed the split on a difference of points of view about 
ad direction 
in addition to being its biggest account saab had symbolic 
significance for lord einstein it was the first major account lord 
einstein landed in the tumultous days that followed the creation of 
the agency in march 1988 
lord einstein had been formed by six top executives who quit 
their old agency lord geller federico einstein in a dispute with 
that agencys new owner britains wpp group plc 
saab hired the new agency in april 1988 and lord einstein 
executives frequently cited it as proof of the viability of their 
new operation 
but lord einsteins advertisements were unable to halt a sales 
erosion that has caught not only saab but many other european car 
importers as well 
ms nobile said saab sales in the us reached 47414 cars in 
1986 but dropped 20 percent over the next two years 
the decline continued in 1989 sales through november 1989 were 
29869 down 149 percent from the first 11 months of 1988 
lord einstein used saabs longrunning theme line the most 
intelligent cars ever built in its work for saab 
two print ads used the headlines most car accidents happen in 
a showroom and neutral country attacks germany and japan a 
recent tv commercial used the song what becomes of the 
brokenhearted and scenes from a junkyard filled with some of the 
cars from saabs competitors

sales of new homes surged 96 percent in 
november the steepest gain in four months the government said 
today in a report showing sharp gains in every region of the nation 
except the south 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 710000 units in november 
after edging up a revised 09 percent in october sales in october 
originally were reported to be off 05 percent 
the november gain was the highest since a 141 percent advance 
last july sales had fallen 112 percent in september 
analysts have been looking for a slight improvement in new home 
sales as mortgage interest rates decline rates were boosted 
earlier this year as a result of federal reserve efforts to 
moderate inflation by tightening credit 
the market for new homes remains fixed with both sales of 
single family homes and starts of new homes fluctuating from month 
to month presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
cumulative effect of lower interest rates since their peak early in 
1989 suggests that the housing market may rebound somewhat in the 
coming months 
fixedrate mortgages averaged 974 percent at the end of 
november according to a survey by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp they had peaked at 1122 percent last march 
but despite the lower rates analysts say the sluggish economy 
stemming from the fed action have made many prospective buyers 
wary particularly of higherpriced new homes 
the commerce department reported that the median price of a new 
home was 127000 in november up 33 percent from the revised 
median price of 123000 in october the median is the point at 
which half of the homes sold for more and half for less 
the average price of a home was 155900 up 56 percent from 
october 
the national association of realtors reported last week that 
sales of existing singlefamily homes advanced 32 percent in 
november to their highest level of the year 
john a tuccillo the associations chief economist predicted 
then that falling mortgage rates would boost home sales in coming 
months as buyers take advantage of favorable financing terms 
the median price for existing homes sold in november was 
93000 the realtors said 
new home sales ran up a 299 percent gain in the west the 
highest rate since advancing 477 percent in november 1981 the 
mitsubishi banks weekly economic indicator report suggested the 
november figure would be partially due to a rebound from abnormally 
weak sales following the oct 10 san francisco bayarea earthquake 
sales in the midwest registered a 236 percent gain the 
sharpest since rising 283 percent last july while the northeast 
posted an 85 percent increase 
sales in the south however fell 76 percent after a 57 
percent increase the previous month 
new home sales for the first 11 months of the year were down 35 
percent from the same period of 1988

developer donald j trump whose lawyers often 
are busy fighting unauthorized attempts to use his name has agreed 
to endorse a line of photographic business cards made by a small 
georgia company he had sued for calling the product trump cards 
under an outofcourt settlement announced wednesday trump was 
given the rights to the trump cards trademark and will license 
positive concepts ltd of lithia springs ga to market the 
product trump will receive a monthly royalty 
trump agreed to drop his suit against pcl a suburban atlanta 
company that began making the cards in 1983 the company whose 
trademark application last year prompted trumps lawsuit contends 
it named its product for the highranking suit in a card game 
rather than the billionaire entrepreneur 
pcl president edward a zito said wednesday the settlement was 
beneficial to both sides he said his company avoided a potentially 
lengthy and expensive court battle and got an unusual endorsement 
from trump that should boost the fortunes of his business 
advertisements featuring trumps endorsement will begin 
appearing in national business magazines this spring zito said 
we are quite honored that someone of donald trumps position 
would give us his personal endorsement zito said we couldnt 
get anybody better to endorse our product and were not paying for 
it 
neither zito nor joe silver a spokesman for the trump 
organization in new york would say how much money trump would 
receive in royalties 
zito said however the figure was nominal to someone like trump 
lets face facts hes a billionaire and were just coming 
along as a company zito said whats it to him if he got five 
ten 15000 a year 
zito said the path to the settlement began last summer when he 
called trump to discuss the suit over the cards 
he was cordial but stood his ground zito said i said 
you know we didnt try to steal your name from you in 1983 
nobody knew of you 
zito said he followed up the call by sending trump a sample of 
the cards and suggested the issue could be settled out of court 
trump liked the cards zito said and months of negotiations began 
i like your trump card photographic business cards and think 
they have great potential the outdated printed business card is 
long overdue for a change trump said in a letter late last month 
to zito 
trump whose lawyers usually pounce on any attempt to use the 
trump name pursued a settlement in this case because he liked the 
product silver said 
were constantly involved in lawsuits against people trying to 
trade on mr trumps name and writing cease and desist letters 
silver said 
silver said most cases end up with a permanent injunction 
against use of the name by unauthorized parties we havent lost 
a case he said 
but zito maintained that he never had donald trump in mind when 
he named his product trump cards and he said he never intended 
to try to land a gold mine by fighting trump over the name 
i think thats one of the things he liked that we didnt 
want any money out of him zito said

howeyinthehills fla ap the bush administrations quest 
to open up export markets for farm products is bringing agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter to a florida resort this week to meet 
with foreign counterparts 
yeutter is to play host thursday to top agricultural officials 
from the european community japan canada and australia the 
meeting is billed as the first of a series of informal gatherings 
to thrash out issues such as food production and safety trade 
restrictions and export subsidies 
the 1 days of talks are to be private 
its basically a shirtsleeve gettogether with no negotiating 
and no formal communique to be issued said yeutters press 
secretary kelly shipp 
yeutter held similar meetings with foreign trade and 
agricultural officials when he was this countrys trade 
representative 
among the chief topics on the table is the current round of 
talks on the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
international compact administered from geneva and the impact of 
the 12member european community which comes into being in 1992 
the united states wants to open up markets throughout the world 
phasing out all export subsidies by the end of the century yeutter 
has been a leader in this movement viewing government subsidies to 
producers and shippers as impediments to unrestricted world trade 
the secretary told a polk county citrus growers meeting last 
month that such subsidies pit government treasury against 
government treasury and were indefensible 
the us proposals in the gatt negotiations are designed to turn 
import restrictions into tariffs and then negotiate the tariffs 
down over a period of years yeutter said some farm groups have 
expressed concerns that the negotiations could leave american 
farmers vulnerabe to price undercutting in foreign competition 
the united states has entered into liberalized trade agreements 
with japan and canada pacts which are expected to help farmers and 
other export industries in all three countries within the the next 
few years the agreements gradually phase out tariffs and other 
import restrictions 
the foreign participants are ray macsharry the european 
communitys commissioner of agriculture michihiko kano minister 
of agriculture forestry and fisheries in japan canadian minister

eastern airlines announced fare cuts of up to 45 
percent but its sister carrier continental airlines said it 
plans to raise fares 4 percent because of the surging cost of jet 
fuel 
eastern striving to rebuild as a smaller carrier after a strike 
and bankruptcy filing sweetened the fare discounts announced 
tuesday by eliminating the usual cancellation penalties 
following continentals move northwest airlines announced later 
in the day it will add a 6 fuel surcharge each way to the price of 
domestic tickets starting jan 10 the airline also said it is 
applying for foreign government approval of the surcharge for its 
international flights 
trans world airlines said today it will impose a fuel surcharge 
ranging from 5 to 20 per ticket depending on flight length also 
effective jan 10 twa spokesman don morrison in st louis mo 
said the charge represents about 4 percent of an average ticket 
price 
twa also said it will follow easterns fare discounts but only 
on flights to florida and without eliminating cancellation 
penalties the new twa fares are good through feb 9 compared with 
easterns limit of may 1 
midway airlines said today it is matching easterns fare cuts in 
the two markets where the carriers compete chicagomiami and 
chicagoatlanta the fares are available through may 1 tickets are 
nonrefundable but changes are allowed without penalties said 
spokeswoman sandra allen in chicago 
it wasnt immediately clear whether other major airlines would 
match the fare changes by either eastern or continental both owned 
by houstonbased texas air corp the nations largest airline 
company competitors said they were studying the moves 
last friday several airlines said they were considering ticket 
surcharges to help cover the cost of jet fuel which has jumped to 
around 1 a gallon from 64 cents at the end of october oil prices 
have been boosted in recent weeks by the recordsetting cold snap 
and refinery problems in texas and louisiana 
art kent a spokesman for continental said that airline decided 
on a fare hike rather than a special fuel surcharge because it 
was simpler 
the fare increase follows a discounting move by the nations big 
carriers last week when they lowered fares as much as 30 percent 
in selected markets to lure passengers during the slow winter 
months those fare reductions in effect through early march only 
apply to about 10 percent of the airlines route networks but 
involve densely traveled routes 
easterns cheaper fares announced tuesday are available for 
roundtrip travel from jan 9 through may 1 excluding holidays 
they require a minimum stay of two nights and must be purchased 
seven days in advance although eastern is waiving the 
advancepurchase requirement for travel from jan 923 
in addition the tickets are fully refundable and may be changed 
without penalty an unusual departure from the strict 
nocancellation clauses in other discount airline ticket policies 
the fares are aimed at vacationers who have greater flexibility in 
travel plans than business fliers 
our anywhere fares are up to 45 percent below the current 
industry maxsaver levels george brennan easterns vice 
president for marketing told a new york news conference 
between new york and miami for example the new fares are 
7999 each way depending on the day of travel compared with 
149169 before the discounts fares between atlanta and 
washington were cut to 6989 each way from 109129 
domestic travel in the united states is flat its in a 
stall brennan said our objective is clearly to stimulate 
discretionary travel were looking to generate revenue 
on average brennan said about 50 percent of the seats on each 
flight will be available at the new fares with up to 85 percent to 
90 percent availability on some flights 
despite its new discounts eastern isnt ruling out a fuel 
pricerelated increase like that announced by continental 
were aware of the economic realities facing the industry we 
are not ruling out the possibility of a fuel surcharge at this 
time said eastern spokesman robin matell at the airlines 
headquarters in miami 
eastern has been in bankruptcy reorganization since last march 
when members of the machinists union struck the airline in a wage 
dispute and pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy 
the airline has hired replacement workers and is reshaping itself 
at about twothirds its prestrike size moving its hub from miami 
to atlanta 
brennan said eastern hopes to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings 
early this year 
we dont have a specific date set yet he said 
last thursday eastern said it plans 600 more layoffs along with 
salary cuts for half its 20000 employees to stem the red ink that 
has swamped the airline for a decade the main reason for the cuts 
is the planned sale of easterns latin american routes to rival 
american airlines announced shortly before christmas

a federal judge on wednesday approved a 6 
million settlement of a lawsuit filed by a cbs shareholder who 
claimed the company that owns the cbs television network was 
mismanaged from 1983 to 1986 
the lawsuit was brought in 1986 by roger minkoff a real estate 
investor from st croix virgin islands who owns 12 cbs shares 
the settlement in which the management of cbs inc admits no 
wrongdoing will be paid by a corporate insurance policy it was 
reached nov 28 
because the suit was not a class action the settlement money 
will not be distributed among cbs shareholders instead 45 
million will go to the cbs treasury for an indirect benefit to 
shareholders 
the remaining 15 million will be used to pay minkoffs 
attorney richard greenfield of haverford pa minkoff will receive 
15000 from the attorneys portion of the settlement 
the type of lawsuit brought by minkoff is called a derivative 
action which allows a shareholder to bring a lawsuit for an 
alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the corporations management 
according to barrons law dictionary recovery in such lawsuits 
generally benefits the corporation because the cases assert a 
corporate rather than individual right 
in approving the settlement us district judge john m 
cannella said he found it to be fair and reasonable 
frank barron an attorney for cbs said that even though the 
network believed minkoffs claims were without merit cbs supported 
the settlement because it would free cbs of the litigation and 
benefit the corporation through the 45 million payment 
among the allegations in the suit were that cbs wasted corporate 
assets when it bought part of the ziffdavis publishing co in 1985 
for 3625 million and that the company was hurt by efforts to fend 
off a takeover attempt by ted turner in 1985 
the suit named as defendants former cbs chairman thomas wyman 
chairman william paley president and chief executive officer 
laurence tisch and members of the cbs board in 1986

the stock market drifted in a narrow range 
today stalling after tuesdays rise to record highs 
the markets sharp rise tuesday in the first session of the new 
year featured strength in many stocks that had fared poorly in the 
waning stages of 1989 
analysts said that resulted from a lifting of the pressure of 
yearend tax selling 
but some investors seemed reluctant to chase after stocks today 
given persistent worries about the outlook for the economy and 
corporate earnings 
in the minds of many observers stocks of many companies still 
represent a risky bet that business activity and earnings growth 
will begin to recover later this year from the slump that set in 
several months ago

campbell soup co on wednesday named david 
w johnson chief executive officer at gerber products co its new 
chief executive as the food products company moved to squash 
speculation it will be sold 
johnson is the first outsider selected to head the company in 
its 120year history he replaces rgordon mcgovern who announced 
his early retirement in november after serving as president and 
chief executive since 1980 
analysts hailed johnsons selection and predicted he would bring 
stability to campbell amid growing dissent among members of 
campbells founding family who control about 59 percent of the 
companys 1296 million outstanding common shares 
fundamentally it looks like the news may have shifted toward 
the company being independent with such a strong executive being 
named said marvin b roffman of janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia david johnson has a very fine reputation on wall 
street as an oustanding marketer and an outstanding executive 
johnson 57 was chosen because of his experience at beleaguered 
companies campbell chairman robert j vlasic said he said 
johnsons successful turnaround of gerber has made him one of the 
food industrys most highly respected executives 
his first priority is to analyze the situation and come up 
with recommendations to the board on plans for the future vlasic 
said in a brief telephone interview wednesday we hope that in 
turn will produce results that will change the minds of anybody who 
presently wants to sell their shares 
last month three descendants of john t dorrance sr who 
invented condensed soup in 1897 announced their intention to sell 
their 17 percent interest and push for a sale of the entire 
foodproducts company 
a source close to the group who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said the family members endorsed johnsons selection but 
the source said it doesnt alter the groups intentions 
johnson still faces some very formidable obstacles in turning 
campbells around the source said its a very volatile 
situation here you have a deeplydivided family and board of 
directors 
janney montgomerys roffman agreed that the possibility of a 
sale or takeover remained he said those pushing for a sale would 
consider a move if the price were right 
campbell shares have been driven higher in recent weeks by 
increasing signs of dissent within the dorrance family 
on wednesday campbell closed down 75 cents to 5425 a share in 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
three children of longtime chairman john dorrance jr who 
received control of their fathers 313 percent stake in the 
company said last month they intend to maintain their ownership in 
campbell and keep the company independent 
on tuesday a second group of investors that also includes 
members of the dorrance family said it would maintain control of 
its 25 percent stake and support efforts to keep campbell 
independent 
johnson said he would take an aggressive approach at campbell to 
streamline its bottom line he accepted a fiveyear contract and 
begins the new post on jan 15 
i really enjoy getting involved in turmoil johnson said in 
an interview from michigan i do thrive on chaos 
johnson joined fremont michbased gerber as its chief 
executive in 1987 and has been credited with successfully pacifying 
gerber family shareholders who hold just over 10 percent of the 
companys stock he also successfully reshaped the company after 
several years of declining earnings and takeover rumors 
alfred a piergallini was elected chairman president and chief 
executive of gerber to succeed johnson gerber said following a 
special meeting of the board of directors wednesday 
campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup annually its fiscal 
1989 earnings totaled 13 million or 10 cents a share down 
sharply from a profit of 2741 million or 212 a share the 
previous year 
the most recent results were reduced by 343 million as a result 
of a restructuring in august that included the closing of 
manufacturing plants in camden maryland and tennessee with a loss 
of 2800 jobs

before their classroom walls were repaired last 
year tokyo university engineering students wore cloth masks for 
fear of health hazards from asbestos particles blowing out from 
cracks 
their precaution reflected growing concern about the 
freewheeling use of asbestos in japan the noncommunist worlds 
biggest user of the insulating and fireproofing material 
nonetheless widespread publicity about the dangers of breathing 
asbestos has done little to encourage government restrictions in 
contrast to the tight limitations imposed in the united states and 
other industrailized democracies 
it would be a catastrophe if a severe earthquake like the one 
in san francisco hit tokyo and destroyed buildings like ours 
said hikosaburo yoda a mechanical engineering instructor at tokyo 
university 
and think about how many buildings containing asbestos are 
demolished for reconstruction every day its even more scary he 
said 
about 120 buildings are destroyed every day in tokyo alone the 
local government says but contractors arent even required to warn 
neighbors that telltale asbestos could waft into their homes 
medical evidence shows inhaling asbestos can cause fatal lung 
damage including cancer and other respiratory ailments 
asbestos is not only a danger to workers regularly exposed to 
it such as carpenters shipbuilders and dockworkers irving 
selikoff a mount sinai professor of medicine in new york told a 
recent symposium in tokyo 
a small crack in a steam pipes asbestos insulation could spread 
fibers spewing widely he said selikoff urged japan to cut 
asbestos consumption and tighten safety measures 
the mineral fiber is used in 3000 common items ranging from 
walls and roof tiles to automobile brakes 
japan considers asbestos contamination an occupational problem 
and has compensated 65 victims including 43 lung cancer patients 
said teruo arakawa a labor ministry spokesman he had no figures 
on how many had died 
in workplaces handling the material japan allows 10 times as 
much asbestos fiber in the air as the us environmental protection 
agency the limit of 2 fibers per cubic centimeter for most kinds 
of asbestos was made a guideline in 1976 and a law last year 
although there is no provision for penalties 
japan banned the spraying of asbestos insulation in 1975 but 
government officials say materials containing asbestos are 
indispensable for fireproofing 
the asbestos institute an industry group in montreal canada 
estimates japan was the biggest user of asbestos in 1988 among 
noncommunist countries consuming 325000 tons brazil was next 
using 190000 tons the soviet union was the largest consumer 
using 2 million tons last year 
tokyo governor shunichi suzuki who once vowed to make tokyo 
asbestosfree now says the material is safe as long as its not 
sprayed asbestos insulates a new city hall building 
japan has no plan to follow the us move to ban all 
asbestoscontaining material from public schools by 1996 
in 1987 however the education ministry ordered 47000 public 
schools nationwide to inspect sprayed asbestos in classrooms and 
gymnasiums said kiyoshi sawamoto an education ministry spokesman 
only 1366 or 3 percent of the inspected schools reported they 
had sprayed asbestos and 1000 have removed it he said 
more than 50 percent of japans classrooms and gymnasiums were 
built before 1975 when asbestos was widely sprayed sawamoto said 
because it is difficult to learn the locations and condition of 
asbestos in buildings even wellplanned demolition is never safe 
enough said sentaro yamazaki a representative of nippon asbestos 
abatement industries association 
once fibers are released in the environment they cannot be 
retracted he said 
japan imports its asbestos mainly from the soviet union canada 
and south africa said katsumi yamanaka an executive of japan 
asbestos products industrial association 
asbestos factories are required to conduct air sampling twice a 
year and report the results but regardless of the outcome there 
are no provisions for penalties or mandatory health checks said 
jun sakamoto spokesman for the environmental agency 
there is some evidence that japanese builders are becoming 
sensitive to the concern about asbestos are are voluntarily cutting 
back on its use 
for example ryoichi kawakami a carpenter in kyoto western 
japan said he uses asbestosfree material in housing jobs although 
it costs up to 30 percent more 
my clients understand it he said who wants a house made 
of something hazardous to your health

industries with multibillion dollar stakes in 
clean air legislation fear president bush will accept any bill that 
he can sign before the politically popular earth day celebration in 
april according to a memo describing private strategy meetings 
members of the clean air working group which includes major 
oil gas auto and chemical companies were told that an expensive 
senate clean air bill should be stalled and that senate majority 
leader george j mitchell should be blamed for rushing the 
legislation to the floor the memo says 
president bush on wednesday gave the administrations official 
blessing to earth day 1990 with a proclamation supporting the 
nationwide activities that will call attention to environmental 
protection 
at the white house ceremony he called on congress to quickly 
approve clean air legislation but he warned he will veto such a 
bill if it isnt carefully balanced to protect the nations 
economic interest as well as the environment 
the environmental protection agencys chief spokesman david 
cohen said we are hoping that earth day might create a backdrop 
a political opportunity or incentive for passage of clean air 
legislation but he added the idea the administration would be 
willing to settle for anything is ludicrous 
the memo obtained by the associated press said under the 
heading notes from the cawg nov 27 1989 meeting 
administrations game plan is to push ceos chief operating 
officers to support the president and get bills passed by congress 
in time for signing by earth day april 22nd 
calls from white house and epa to ceos are to be expected 
cawg is concerned since they believe wh wants any bill by ed 
wh is the white house and ed stands for earth day 
mitchell dmaine and sen max baucus dmont are the key 
strategists on the senate bill which has generally won 
environmentalists support for its provisions aimed at cleaning the 
air of acid rain toxic chemicals and urban smog 
but the industry group says the bill is too costly and would 
impose too strict pollution reduction requirements on business it 
is stricter than legislation proposed by bush and a separate 
measure that passed a house subcommittee 
the house measure is still before the full energy and commerce 
committee but the senate version was quickly approved by the 
environment and public works committee in november mitchell said 
it would be the first legislation considered when senators return 
jan 23 from their winter recess 
the industry group memo also described a meeting last dec 4 in 
which participants were said to have pointed out that dozens of 
senators were asking congressional research agencies for an 
economic impact analysis of the legislation this is a key 
part of stalling early action on the bill the memo said 
it said industry representatives were urged to contact senators 
many times and tell them senators are upset at mitchell for 
speed of action and not deliberating on the issues 
william fay administrator of the clean air working group said 
in an interview except for the word stall its probably 
fairly accurate notes i want a clean air bill this year if it 
gets done this year whats the purpose of a stall 
i didnt use that language fay said adding that he 
couldnt recall whether another participant did 
fay denied that the participants were told to attack mitchell 
but he acknowledged they were asked at the meeting to make a point 
that this is basically a railroaded bill because it was rushed 
through the senate environment and public works committee with 
little debate in november 
fay said more than 100 business representatives attend meetings 
of the coalition which is composed of 1950 companies and trade 
associations interested in clean air legislation 
a mitchell aide would not comment on the specifics of the memo 
the aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the maine 
democrat had made it known for months that the bill would be the 
first item of business this year there will be significant 
debate senator mitchell welcomes that debate the aide said 
baucus said the time has come for action and denied the 
senate measure was railroaded to the floor the bill he said is 
the result of 65 days of hearings hundreds of meetings with 
congressional administration and industry representatives and 
literally thousands of pages of testimony 
fay said the senate bills requirements for reducing smog are 
punitive costly and inflexible he said a number of 
industries with revenues exceeding 100 billion a year may not 
survive the standards for reducing health risks from toxic 
chemical emissions 
he contended the requirement to cut acid rain emissions puts 
an incredible economic burden on the industrial midwest and 
southeast auto exhaust standards cannot be achieved by any 
known technology he said and predicted that plants making 
familysized cars would have to shut down

takeover speculation sent paramount 
communications inc stock sharply higher and cbs inc shares lower 
wednesday as unconfirmed rumors surfaced that cbs was about to bid 
for the entertainment and publishing giant 
paramount stock rose 150 to 5237 a share in new york stock 
exchange composite trading while cbs tumbled 275 to 184 a share 
cbs spokeswoman ann morfogen denied her company was about to bid 
for paramount saying its not true its a rumor 
at paramount spokesman jerry sherman said his firm would not 
comment on any rumors 
spokespeople at both companies said they had gotten calls from 
the news media about the rumors which apparently were circulating 
among cbs news employees 
paramount parent of paramount pictures has been considered a 
possible takeover target ever since it launched its own illfated 
122 billion buyout bid for time inc last year 
cbs meanwhile has been expected to expand since laurence a 
tisch became chief executive in 1986 and began selling the 
companys book and magazine publishing businesses and its records 
divisions 
wall street analysts said they would be surprised by a cbs bid 
for paramount but they also said the combination had many 
advantages for the broadcaster 
peter appert an analyst with cj lawrencemorgan grenfell 
said regulatory strictures on the television networks are easing 
this year and that one of the big networks likely would seek its 
own production company to create more inhouse programming 
paramount which until last june was called gulf amp western inc 
systematically pared itself down in recent years from a 
conglomerate to a specialist in publishing and entertainment 
besides paramount pictures company properties include the 
publishers simon amp schuster and prentice hall cable television 
systems and networks including usa and msg madison square garden 
in new york and the new york knicks and new york rangers 
professional sports teams 
paramount pictures current films include harlem nights 
were no angels and shirley valentine 
cbs businesses include its television and radio networks 
entertainment sports and news divisions and five television and 
20 radio stations

the rally in energy futures continued wednesday 
with crude oil prices bid higher by strong demand from refiners 
prices of wholesale unleaded gasoline and home heating oil also 
extended recent gains on the new york mercantile exchange 
the contract for february delivery of west texas intermediate 
the main us grade of crude oil rose 79 cents to 2368 per 
42gallon barrel adding to tuesdays increase of 107 contracts 
for march april and may delivery rose by 56 cents 45 cents and 41 
cents respectively 
the settlement price for the february contract was the highest 
since the nearmonth contract closed at 2465 on april 20 
according to market analysts 
unleaded gasoline futures which staged an unusual winter rally 
on tuesday moved up again gasoline prices typically are more apt 
to strengthen during the peak summer driving season the february 
contract added 154 cents to tuesdays surge of 394 cents and 
finished at 6723 cents a gallon the march through may contracts 
ended with gains of 166 cents 176 cents and 165 cents 
heating oil for february delivery rose 081 cent to 7820 cents 
a gallon bringing the increase over the past two sessions to 395 
cents heating oil contracts for march delivery jumped 147 cents 
while the april and may contracts each added 116 cents 
strong fundamental demand plus speculative buying combined to 
prolong the rally in the energy futures pits said larry lawrence 
manager of options and technical analysis at elders futures inc 
he said refiners rushed to buy crude because of the wide margin 
between crude and refined petroleum products and on the assumption 
that prices for refined products could continue to go higher 
rumors of possible cutbacks in opec production also may have 
lent support to crude prices lawrence said the reports of reduced 
oil output by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
were not confirmed

president bush who repeatedly has vowed not 
to propose higher taxes is considering a levy on certain raw 
materials to encourage industrial recycling administration 
officials said wednesday 
the perton fee which would be imposed on materials such as 
glass paper and aluminum is likely to be included in bushs 
fiscal 1991 budget when it is submitted to congress on jan 29 
said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
that bushs new budget for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
will contain no new taxes 
we do not believe theres any need to raise taxes fitzwater 
said at the same time he said the new budget would contain some 
very interesting programs 
administration sources said that the proposal on raw materials 
would be more of a user fee than a tax thus exempting it from 
bushs nonewtaxes pledge 
budget officials frequently seek to draw a distinction between a 
widely applied tax and a more narrowly targeted user fee even 
though both raise revenues for the treasury and even though the 
distinction may be lost on those paying the levy 
the aim of the rawmaterials proposal first reported by the 
wall street journal in wednesdays editions is intended to provide 
an economic incentive for industries to use recycled goods rather 
than virgin materials 
the tax would not be applied to recycled substances 
we want to encourage recycling for obvious reasons said 
deputy white house press secretary stephen hart 
while declining to discuss the proposal he said work is under 
way on the issue of recycling within the administration 
hart said that the work on recycling was part of bushs 
intention to put a focus on measures to protect the environment 
bush on wednesday signed a proclamation designating april 22 as 
earth day the 20th anniversary of the first earth day 
in deciding to make this earth day proclamation the first 
proclamation of the new year and the new decade i want to make 
this point earth day and every day should inspire us to save the 
land we love to realize that global problems do have local 
solutions and to make the preservation of the planet a personal 
commitment bush said 
the president also called on congress to work quickly 
carefully and responsibly to approve strengthening amendments to 
the clean air act 
congress recessed for the year without completing work on a 
legislative package to rework air quality standards 
fitzwater meanwhile said that the administration has abandoned 
an earlier budget proposal that would have proposed a tax or user 
fee on recreational vehicles to pay for conservation measures 
we did a thorough assessment of that situation and weighed all 
the ins and outs of the way that system worked and decided there 
probably was a better way to do that fitzwater said

sailors fought to keep a huge oil slick 
from fouling sensitive atlantic coastline wednesday as dutch tv 
reported that three sister ships of the tanker involved were 
recently seized for maintenance defects 
seamen laid floating barriers while helicopters sprayed 
chemicals on a greenish 100squaremile spill oozing from the 
iranian tanker khark 5 
morocco threatened to file a lawsuit against irans national oil 
company and accused salvors of reacting too slowly to the dec 19 
explosion that tore through the khark 5s hull spilling 19 million 
gallons of crude oil 
state department spokesman richard boucher announced in 
washington that a coast guard antipollution expert was leaving for 
morocco on wednesday to help with the crisis 
dutch television said authorities in the netherlands seized five 
iranianowned tankers over the past 14 months and prevented them 
from leaving rotterdam until they underwent repairs among them 
three sister ships of the khark 5 
none of the ships were identified and no specific defects were 
listed the report said only that the vessels failed to meet 
international safety and environmental standards 
rotterdams shipping inspection office responsible for any 
seizures in the worlds largest port was closed and could not be 
reached for comment 
mohamed naciri head of a team of moroccan lawyers following the 
crisis for the government said of the threatened lawsuit the 
financial damages can only be estimated when we have the means to 
measure the harm which already seems very high to us 
salvors towed the khark 5 outside the 200mile limit of 
moroccos territorial waters the official maghreb arabe presse 
news agency reported but the dutch salvage firm smit tak said the 
halfsunken vessel was 130 miles off north africa 
helicopters sprayed oildispersants on the leading edge of the 
slick which crept to within 20 miles of the oysterfarming 
community of oualidyia map said 
in addition two french techicians in morocco helped direct 
operations to vacuum polluted seawater into separators that recycle 
the water and pump the oil into barges 
pollution experts have said high waves have broken up much of 
the oil which has also been dissolving in the 60degree seas 
weather forecasters said winds and 13foot waves on thursday may 
make conditions unfavorable for cleanup and salvage operations 
map reported 
fisheries tourist beaches a migratory bird reserve and an 
important breeding ground of pink flamingoes would be threatened by 
the oil the interior ministry said so would 100000 related jobs 
this fishing coast represents 75 percent of the 600000 tons 
of fish caught each year in morocco said maritime fishing 
minister bensalem smili 
back in paris from a twoday visit to the former french colony 
to assess the spill french envrionment minister brice lalonde 
criticized gaps in international maritime law to protect the 
environment 
im concerned not only with whats going to happen to the 
moroccan coast but with whats going to happen to the tanker 
now that its on the open seas lalonde said 
three tugboats towed the 283632ton ship toward calmer waters 
near the cape verde islands an 1100mile journey expected to take 
eight days 
there has been no leakage from the tankers two ruptured storage 
tanks since monday according to smit tak spokesman daan kaakebeen 
map said about 530 gallons of oil continued to escape each hour 
the khark 5 was loaded with 72 million gallons of light iranian 
crude oil when the explosion occurred about 400 miles north of las 
palmas in the canary islands 
the cause of the blast is unknown a fire forced the crew to 
abandon ship 
morocco says smit tak took too long in getting salvage work 
under way the company says its operations were hampered by the 
refusal of morocco and spain to allow the tanker to be towed near 
their coasts for emergency repairs

department of transportation to block the sale of trans world 
airlines chicagolondon route to american airlines and to award 
the route to pan am instead 
last month twa agreed to sell its chicagolondon route plus 
facilities at chicagos ohare international airport to american 
for 195 million the transaction requires approval by the 
department of transportation 
twa spokesman don morrison said that airline was studying pan 
ams filing with the department and would have no immediate comment 
ed stewart a spokesman for american at its headquarters near 
fort worth texas said were confident that were going to get 
approval its a winwin situation 
he said american the nations largest airline is the only 
viable player since it has a hub in chicago 
in a statement new yorkbased pan am said the fair and most 
expeditious way for the government to proceed is to designate the 
only other us carrier certificated in the market pan am twa 
has been the only us airline allowed to fly the chicagolondon 
route pan am noted 
pan am which has been in financial trouble for years said it 
would offer many benefits that american cannot provide such as 
being able to serve londons more popular heathrow airport while 
american would only be able to fly into gatwick airport 
late last month pan am said it intends to protest to the 
government americans planned purchase of eastern airlines latin 
american routes which depart from miami pan am contends that the 
route transfer from ailing eastern to expanding american would 
hinder competition pan am american and eastern compete strongly 
in the miami market 
in its statement wednesday pan am said americans proposed 
purchase of the chicagolondon route is part of a recent pattern 
of route and asset purchases by the largest us carrier that will 
result in further concentration in the aviation industry and less 
competition

g heileman brewing co is reporting 
higher operating income for the first half of its fiscal year and 
is working with its banks on possible ways to modify its debt 
structure a top heileman official said wednesday 
operating income for the first half of the brewerys fiscal year 
far exceeds last years results said president murray cutbush in a 
news release in which he tried to put some distance between 
heilemans financial condition and that of its parent bond corp 
of australia 
at the same time he said the brewery is working closely with 
its banks in reviewing a number of additional alternatives aimed at 
favorably modifying heilemans existing debt structure 
heilemans bankers in the united states have granted 
modifications and waivers to the brewerys revolving credit 
agreement cutbush said those changes allow heileman the required 
flexibility to achieve its operating goals and improve its overall 
financial position he said 
heilemans focus remains on core brand profitability 
cutbush said this strategy is now paying dividends which are 
reflected in our bottomline results at a time when heileman is 
coming into its own its unfortunate that unrelated issues are 
clouding the gains that weve achieved 
cutbush said heileman is a standalone operation with financing 
independent of bond corp headed by alan bond 
bond lawyers are fighting an effort to have the companys 
australian brewing interests placed in receivership the national 
australian bank which has loans to bond corp requested the 
action 
cutbush noted the moves involving the australian brewing 
operations do not have a direct affect on heileman operations 
he added that an interest payment due in the united states from 
bond a payment that reportedly has been delayed is not 
associated with heileman 
la crossebased heilemans financial arrangements contain no 
crossfault clauses that could be triggered as a result of the 
receivership action in australia against bond brewing holdings 
limited a subsidiary of bond corp cutbush said 
cutbush said heilemans strong financial performance so far 
this fiscal year results in part from price increases implemented 
last year continuing emphasis on core brands savings from lower 
agricultural costs reduced capacity and lower general and 
administrative costs associated with the companys regional 
operating structure 
were now seeing the results of those critical programs 
implemented in 1989 theyll continue to produce the kind of fiscal 
gains weve already seen in the first half of this fiscal year 
cutbush said 
bond purchased heileman for about 13 billion in 1987 then 
sold off the heileman baking and machine products co subsidiaries 
to reduce debt

new home sales jumped 96 percent in november 
their fastest gain in four months the government said wednesday in 
a report analysts saw as evidence that the housing industry 
continues to be aided by lower mortgage rates 
it shows that when mortgage rates are at relatively affordable 
levels buyers will be buying homes said mark obrinsky an 
economist with the federal national mortgage association 
michael carliner an economist with the national association of 
home builders agreed that the report shows consumers are 
responding to lower interest rates 
but carliner added that many home builders are concerned wether 
rates will remain at low levels this year saying that in the 
five years ive been here ive never seen them so nervous 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 710000 units in november 
after a revised 09 percent gain the month before october sales 
originally were reported down 05 percent 
it was the sharpest surge since a 141 percent advance last july 
this certainly should take some of the wind out of stories 
that the housing market is about to collapse said economist 
richard peach of the mortgage bankers association 
peach noted that in addition to new home sales sales of 
existing houses also hit a fairly good pace in november and that 
housing starts while not rising like gangbusters are 
improving 
some analysts including carliner and obrinsky saw the 
possiblity of slightly higher mortgage interest rates this year as 
the federal reserve straddles a fine line of trying to keep 
inflation under control by restraining credit while not pushing the 
economy into a recession with high interest rates 
the fed began last june to let shortterm rates drop gradually 
mortgage rates have fallen from an 1122 percent peak to 974 
percent at the end of november according to the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 
nevertheless new home sales for the first 11 months of the year 
were down 35 percent from the same period of last year 
the sharpest gain in new home sales in november occurred in the 
west which posted a 299 percent advance analysts attributed much 
of the increase to a rebound from depressed sales following the 
oct 17 san francisco bayarea earthquake october sales in the 
region had plummeted 216 percent 
the midwest also recorded strong sales up 236 percent sales 
in the northeast rose 85 percent 
the south had the only decline a drop of 76 percent

the united states and japan have postponed 
until february the next round of talks on indirect causes of the 
huge trade imbalance between the nations such as different 
lifestyles and cultural and business traditions 
the japanese government requested that we postpone for some 
weeks our january meeting so that more time could be devoted to 
preparing for the talks and we agreed to the request the state 
department said in a statement wednesday 
the next session will take place at a mutually convenient time 
and place in february the statement added opening the 
possibility it could be elsewhere than tokyo where the meeting 
originally was planned for midjanuary 
only modest progress far less than we had hoped for was 
reported by a us treasury official after the second round of the 
talks in washington last november 
the official assistant secretary charles dallara said the 
japanese side showed very little flexibility in reaching 
common ground on the nature of structural problems that lead in 
part to the 50 billion annual us trade deficit with japan 
an official of japans foreign ministry cautioned after the 
washington round that progress could not be expected overnight 
the bush administration has staked high hopes on success of what 
is officially called the structural impediment initiative and 
warned that its failure would revive pressure from congress to 
restrict us imports of japanese goods 
the talks were proposed to pinpoint problems contributing to the 
trade imbalance stemming from lifestyles traditions and 
traditional business practices rather than formal market barriers 
an interim report is due in early spring

a proposed merger of financially troubled centrust 
bank with a bank owned by a billionaire cruise ship magnate was 
announced late wednesday as part of a plan to ward off regulators 
from the miamibased savings and loan 
the nonbinding agreement calls for centrust and ensign bank to 
begin negotiations to reorganize under a new holding company the 
merger would include a cash infusion from ensigns parent hamilton 
holding co which is controlled by carnival cruise lines inc 
principal owner ted arison 
the merger would be contingent upon several conditions 
including federal approval of centrusts plans to sell 63 of its 71 
branches to great western bank of beverly hills calif according 
to a statement by both companies 
ensign financial corp which operates new yorkbased ensign 
bank has 27 branches in metropolitan new york and in florida and 
reported federally insured assets in 1988 of about 2 billion 
last year ensign called off a 170 million takeover bid for 
anchor savings bank of new york a merger that would have created 
the nations fifthlargest savings bank with assets of about 103 
billion 
the latest proposed merger is intended halt pressure from 
regulators seeking to reorganize centrust which was criticized for 
its heavy investment in an expensive art collection and the lavish 
lifesytle of chairman david paul 
in december the federal office of thrift supervision ordered 
centrust to sell its art collection some of which had been kept at 
pauls home as well as limousines a corporate jet and a sailboat 
it also forbid centrust from increasing its executives salaries 
or paying dividends to stockholders 
state comptroller gerald lewis on dec 20 gave paul 21 days to 
resign or contest the complaint a statement released by centrust 
said paul would vigorously oppose removal 
lewis complaint claimed paul violated his duty as officer of a 
financial institution by using centrust employees to perform 
personal services charging the company for personal bills and 
buying luxuries it cited 30 million in art bought with centrust 
funds including 12 million paid for peter paul rubens portrait 
of a man as mars 
the complaint also questioned pauls 48 million salary from 
january 1988 to september 1989 when the thrift suffered pretax 
operating losses of 76 million 
last week a us district court judge in washington refused an 
appeal by centrust and ordered the bank to take back a 310000 
bonus paid to paul in october 
centrust with 9 billion in assets is floridas largest thrift 
and the 22nd largest in the country 
the statement issued late wednesday did not place a price on the 
proposed merger or indicate how much would be paid to centrust 
shareholders
