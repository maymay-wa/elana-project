president bush on friday prodded saddam 
hussein to agree to talks on the persian gulf crisis by jan 3 and 
said he may ask congress to authorize an attack against iraq unless 
saddam pulls out of kuwait by jan 15 
bush said he had offered iraq a choice of 15 dates in the next 
three weeks for highlevel talks he ought to take one of them 
bush declared at a news conference 
for the first time bush said he was considering asking congress 
for approval for a military strike against iraq unless saddams 
army is withdrawn by the jan 15 deadline set by the united 
nations 
meanwhile cia director william webster said us analysts have 
concluded that saddam will not leave kuwait until convinced he is 
in peril of imminent military attack according to a report of an 
interview with webester 
bush said i think it would send a very strong clear signal to 
the world if congress endorsed his persian gulf policy or the 
un resolution authorizing force against iraq 
i want a peaceful solution to this crisis but i will not be a 
party to circumventing or diluting the united nations deadline 
bush said 
as bush turned up the heat on iraq there was a heros welcome 
for ambassador nathaniel howell who led a fourmonth holdout of 
american diplomats at the besieged us embassy compound in kuwait 
city 
welcome home and thanks for a job well done secretary of 
state james a baker iii told howell at andrews air force base 
outside washington as the ambassador stepped off a plane with about 
50 american and foreign hostages he led from iraq and kuwait as 
you were freed now too we must see kuwait freed of iraqi 
occupation baker declared 
the group was welcomed by a crowd of cheering friends and family 
members waving flags and bearing balloons 
us insistence on manning the embassy until all americans who 
wanted to leave kuwait were given that chance had dramatized us 
refusal to recognize iraqs claim of sovereignty over kuwait 
bush met with reporters on the south lawn moments before 
boarding a helicopter to fly to camp david for a weekend with his 
family 
webster interviewed by reporters and editors of the washington 
post was quoted as saying saddams army has 1000 tons of lethal 
chemicals much of it loaded in almost every type of 
weapon including some in kuwait a report of the interview 
appeared in saturday editions of the newspaper 
saddam may not know what his own decision will be and he will be 
more likely to fight if he thought our end goal was his 
destruction webster said 
the white house indicated it was ready to pounce if iraq and the 
united states failed to agree on a date for gulf talks it gives 
us a very strong propaganda point that hes saddam not willing 
to even consider discussions that might lead to a peaceful 
resolution presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
two weeks ago bush had said baker could go to baghdad anytime 
up to jan 15 but he acknowledged that he has backed away from 
that 
i wish id been a little more explicit in my first 
announcement about what i meant about mutually convenient dates 
the president said 
iraq proposed that foreign minister tariq aziz come to the 
united states next monday and that baker go to baghdad on jan 12 
but bush said the date proposed by baghdad wouldnt leave time 
for iraqi forces to leave kuwait by the deadline set by the un 
that deadline is real bush said adding that iraqi forces 
must be totally out totally out by then 
the administration says the purpose of the prospective trip to 
baghdad by baker is not to negotiate a settlement but to issue a 
facetoface demand that saddam withdraw his troops 
it simply is not credible that he cannot over a two week 
period make a couple of hours available for the secretary of state 
on an issue of this importance unless of course he is seeking to 
circumvent the united nations deadline the president said 
bush added weve offered 15 days and he ought to get moving 
and do something reasonable if he really wants to move the peace 
effort 
he refused to say if he would bend on his insistence that 
bakers trip must occur by jan 3 
i dont want to draw deadlines in the sand here but there 
would have to be some compelling reason for me to change it bush 
said 
two republican senators richard lugar of indiana and john 
mccain of arizona met with bush and said afterward that he was 
prepared to call off the meetings with iraq because of the impasse 
over dates however fitzwater disputed their account 
on capitol hill joint chiefs of staff chairman colin powell 
said the pentagon can keep its forces deployed in the gulf region 
as long as the president wants them deployed 
both powell and defense secretary dick cheney said that 
continuation of the military effort could require the callup of 
additional us reserve units and powell suggested that the force 
could shrink if needed for longterm sustainability 
cheney also said the administration hopes that congress will 
give it a vote of confidence early next year on the objectives of 
the deployment getting iraq out of kuwait and restoring its 
government but he added i cant think of anything more damaging 
than an indication from congress that they are not supportive 
of the presidents policies 
meanwhile other military officials said the pentagon is sending 
more doctors blood supplies and field hospitals to the persian 
gulf to handle american and allied casualties that could occur in a 
land war against iraq 
navy officials said that up to 8000 more reservists will be 
ordered to active duty to support the expansion of combat medical 
care in and around saudi arabia though the total numbers of 
hospitals beds medical people and supplies for operation desert 
shield are kept secret 
on the financial markets meanwhile traders said the continued 
stalemate of usiraqi talks drove oil prices up in trading 
friday 
in a new sampling of public opinion americans surveyed for a 
new york timescbs news poll were almost evenly divided on whether 
the united states should begin military action against iraq if 
saddam does not withdraw from kuwait by jan 15 
in the telephone poll of 1044 adults conducted sunday through 
tuesday 48 percent said the united states should wait longer to 
see if economic sanctions work 45 percent said military action 
should be started and the rest either didnt know or didnt

one year after the us military 
invasion of panama the army has revised downward its estimate of 
the dead based on panamanian government statistics the southern 
command said friday 
it said in a news release that figures from the panamanian 
institute of legal medicine show a maximum of 345 soldiers and 
civilians may have died in the dec 21 1989 invasion to oust gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
positive identifications were made of 270 dead and 75 additional 
bodies are missing 
at the time of the invasion the army calculated 314 military 
and 202 civilian deaths the release said 
the opposition to president guillermo endaras government says 
thousands died but the southern command said the allegations 
have turned out to be without foundation 
the panamanian human rights committee estimated 295 to 385 died 
the army said 65 bodies were identified as military personnel 
155 as civilians and 50 not classified 
it is impossible to determine exactly how many have died as a 
direct consequence of the military action or to attribute specific 
causes to each of the deaths it said 
many died in a huge fire some died during looting murders in 
traffic accidents and from natural causes during the invasion it 
added 
all are included in the new estimate 
the army said it investigated 14 of 24 complaints it received 
about serious misconduct of soldiers it said it threw out nine 
complaints as not meriting investigation and has one case pending 
the southern command said 11 of the complaints investigated were 
forwarded through legal channels and three were found to be without 
basis

a usarmed guerrilla organization has 
reached tentative agreement with the sovietbacked government of 
angola on a plan to end 15 years of civil war rebel leader jonas 
savimbi said friday 
at a lengthy session thursday under the auspices of the united 
states soviet union and portugal the warring sides agreed to set 
a date for free elections and then immediately sign a ceasefire 
savimbi told reporters 
the breakthrough in the tortuous peace efforts followed a flurry 
of meetings here this week including an unprecedented session 
between savimbi and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
savimbi who until now had been vilified by the kremlin as an 
anticommunist menace also met with president bush thursday 
in lisbon angolan foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem 
said a cease fire could be signed next month he spoke during a 
stopover on his return tom angola from a trip to washington 
washington and moscow have been pressing their allies in angola 
to stop the fighting which has killed over 300000 people and left 
the mineralrich country in ruin 
the united states has shipped unita as much as 50 million in 
weapons every year since 1986 the soviets have given the angolan 
government as much as 800 million annually us officials say 
under the proposed agreement reached thursday both sides would 
stop sending weapons once a ceasefire is signed us officials 
said 
savimbi said that at thursdays meeting the highestlevel 
gathering between the sides unita and the secondranking official 
in angolas ruling party lopo do nascimento had agreed on five 
points 
among them is agreement that signing of a ceasefire should be 
preceded by setting a date for free elections a ceasefire should 
be guaranteed by international observers and outside military 
assistance will stop once a ceasefire agreement is signed 
the other two points called for a democratic system of 
government and international monitoring of elections 
the sides agreed that international peacekeepers will be sent 
to angola under the banner of the united nations he said still to 
be settled he said are differences over the nations who will take 
part 
savimbi said all the participants except for the angolan 
government were ready to sign the fivepoint plan at thursdays 
session the angolan government official asked for more time to 
confer with his superiors in luanda savimbi said 
but he added there is no question that the government will 
agree in principle 
the us soviet and portuguese participants in the talks held a 
news conference late thursday saying significant progress was 
made but declined to elaborate at that time 
but a us official speaking on condition of anonymity on 
friday confirmed the gist of savimbis account of the meeting 
unita is optimistic that the remaining differences between the 
two parties can be successfully addressed and that signature of a 
ceasefire will be possible during the sixth round of 
negotiations he said 
the talks are scheduled next month in portugal the former 
colonial ruler of angola 
if the angolan government approves the five points and proposes 
a date for elections the sides can sign a ceasefire at the 
january session savimbi said elections could be held within nine 
months to a year from the ceasefire date he added 
if my party nominates me ill run for president savimbi 
said 
at the outset of the negotiations last year the government 
demanded that savimbi go into exile it later dropped that demand 
responding to military pressure from unita and to the democratic 
changes sweeping eastern europe the government also gradually 
moved away from a statecontrolled economy toward a market system 
last week angolas ruling party agreed to allow multiparty 
democracy and free elections

defense secretary dick cheney has ordered the 
navy to justify the a12 attack plane in three weeks or else kill 
it because of intolerable problems the pentagon announced friday 
night 
if we cannot spend the taxpayers money wisely we will not 
spend it cheney said in a directive to navy secretary lawrence 
garrett 
the secretary gave the navy until jan 4 to justify the plane 
the announcement said a special team would meet with the 
contractors general dynamics corp and mcdonnell douglas corp 
both based in st louis to review the situation 
the a12 program is in serious trouble the apparent schedule 
slippage cost growth and management deficiences in this program 
are intolerable cheney said 
the a12 was supposed to replace the elderly a6 as the navys 
primary allweather carrierborne attack plane starting in 1995 
the plane was to use radarevading stealth techniques and carry 
the nickname avenger 
the navy had planned purchase of 620 planes for an estimated 52 
billion and deployment starting in 1995 
but a 47 billion development program supposed to deliver six 
prototypes is 1 billion over budget and 18 months behind 
schedule garrett recently ordered the admiral heading the program 
to retire and reassigned two other officers because the three 
failed to pass news of problems up the chain of command 
the navy has begun a criminal investigation of excessive 
payments to the contractors 
also john a betti the pentagons top procurement officer 
said wednesday he would resign as undersecretary of defense for 
acquisitions at the end of the year to avoid the bite of new ethics 
laws that take effect jan 1 officials said he had planned to 
leave anyway but the timing of his announcement was influenced by 
news of the a12s problems 
the departments inspector general said betti had failed to 
report conclusions of his own staff that the a12 was in trouble 
but had relied on assurances from the contractors and the navy that 
development would be completed under budget the contractors she 
said controlled the work of the governments inspectors 
garrett refused to block the promotion to rear admiral of one of 
the officers capt lawrence s elberfeld 
garrett defended the current procurement system but noted 
people find it very hard to push bad news up to the top 
large weapons purchases are not often cancelled many analysts 
have noted instead congress and the pentagon tend to look for 
ways to strech out production and buyj fewer models a tactic that 
frequently slows the production pace to inefficient rates and can 
even raise total costs if the a12 is cancelled it will be a 
rarity for such a large program 
cheney was particularly upset at being sandbagged by bad news 
with the a12 because he had reassured congress in april the plane 
was doing well five weeks before news of the cost overruns and 
delays became known at the time cheney announced a reduction in 
planned purchases from more than 800 to 620 
few details of the a12 or what has gone wrong with it have 
been released but stealth technology is brand new and known to be 
difficult an official sketch of the a12 shows a flyingwing 
design like the new air force b2 bomber another stealth plane 
that cost far more to develop than expected 
congress has committed funds to only 15 b2s and some estimates 
have reached 800 million a copy 
stealth techology much of it secret is known to involve novel 
shapes like the flying wing to deflect radar beams away rather than 
reflect them back to the antenna radarabsorbing materials on 
exterior surfaces and nonmetallic composites in the places 
structure that wont reflect radar 
the a6 called the intruder first flew in 1960 and early 
versions have long since been converted to tankers or other 
specialpurpose craft the last 10 airplanes of the series are 
being built by grumman corp under a contract calling for final 
delivery in september 1991 
still almost all carriers carry the a6 no other plane in the 
navy has the elaborate electronics that make possible attacks at 
night and in storms combined with the huge munitions load up to 
18000 pounds of the a6 
cheneys statement said that no matter what happens to the a12 
we will continue to need to develop a basic strike airplane for 
our aircraft carrier force the a6 our current carrier strike 
plane is aging and we must move ahead with an alternative that 
incorporates the technological advances necessary to maintain us 
naval air superiority 
older slower and less maneuverable a6 planes will be less 
able to penetrate enemy defenses and conduct their attacks stealth 
technology will be required if attack aircraft are to elude 
advanced fighters and surfacetoair missiles in the future the 
us needs to maintain the capability to project power through the 
use of naval strike forces cheney said 
a prominent congressional critic of the a12 rep john conyers 
dmich chairman of the house government operations committee 
said friday night he welcomed cheneys decision 
but the a12 is only the tip of the iceberg of the 
pentagons procurement problems conyers said 
a spokesman for chris schildz a spokesman for general dynamics 
said when asked for comment our representatives will be 
available to meet with government officials anytime jim reed 
spokesman for mcdonnell douglas said the company was hopeful 
that the current difficulties can be resolved quickly to everyones 
satisfaction we feel that the a12 program is very important for 
the defense of our country as well as to mcdonnell douglas

when john a gambling took over his dads radio 
show america still liked ike elvis was waiting for his draft 
notice the chicago white sox were playing in the world series 
on friday john a retired eisenhower is dead presleys 
supposed to be dead the white sox may be coming back from the 
dead but john as son john r becomes gambling generation no 3 
to be host of the local morning radio show as it wraps up its 65th 
year 
you could always turn on the radio and find old john young 
john or inbetween john says john a who took over in 1959 
from the shows founder and his father john b gambling 
if people wake up and hear about problems a strike a war 
assassination whatever they turn us on and know the world hasnt 
come to an end their world has some continuity 
much like new york radios first family rambling with 
gambling has been a gotham fixture since the roaring 20s 
outlasting a dozen mayors 11 presidents billy martin five times 
and three wars 
their show is not typical big apple in a city known for ed 
kochs abrasiveness and george steinbrenners arrogance the 
gamblings provide a quiet morning introduction to whats going on 
i firmly believe that the last thing listeners want to hear in 
this controlled mayhem is more noise more confusion theres 
enough of that in their own kitchens says john a 60 in 
explaining his theory of broadcasting 
the gambling family introduction into the radio business offered 
no indication of the dynasty to come 
john b gambling was an engineer at woram in 1925 when he 
subbed for the regular announcer on a morning calisthenics show 
there were no aerobics back then john a officially took over 
the show 34 years later with his son john r joining him in 
january 1985 
eighteen months ago the guinness book of world records 
proclaimed rambling with gambling the worlds longestrunning 
radio show after its 20000th broadcast 
john a cites that along with a 30th anniversary broadcast from 
madison square garden as the highlights of his career gambling 
says hell miss the camaraderie of the crew doing his show along 
with the loyal listeners whove kept his ratings high through the 
years 
we have an opportunity to touch millions of lives youre 
never quite sure how but you hope you do it in a positive way 
said john a every once in a while theres feedback and you 
find out how you touched someone that makes it all worthwhile 
in addition to longevity theres been innovation the gamblings 
are credited with providing the citys first radio newscast first 
helicopter traffic report and its first school closings bulletins 
there are additional gamblings waiting to grab the microphone 
down the line john r has three sons much to john as dismay 
they are named andrew bradley and william although hes quick to 
point out they all have the middle name john 
the really marvelous part is the passing of the baton along to 
my son says gambling and hes got a few of his own waiting in 
the wings

babies are twice as likely to die of sudden 
infant death syndrome in the winter than in the summer and at age 2 
months than age 4 months a new federal study shows 
ut even though sids experts long presumed those facts to be 
true they still dont know why 
the national centers for disease control analyzing eight years 
of infant mortality data reported thursday that the sids risk is 
twice as high in january as in july and more than twice as high at 
2 months as at 4 months 
the findings are important to researchers looking for the cause 
of sids which kills about 6000 american infants a year 
what we suspect is that an infectious process is somehow 
triggering death in these infants during cold weather said dr 
jose becerra an infant health specialist with the atlantabased 
cdc 
theres also a remarkably similar pattern for age and season 
in infectious diseases very similar he said its 
intriguing 
a 1988 study suggested a possible relationship between 
respiratory infections and sids pointing to episodes of vomiting 
or diarrhea in the two weeks preceding death in some cases 
that study indicated that breastfeeding could be protective 
against sids by guarding against gastrointestinal or respiratory 
infections 
breastfeeding might help avert some of the gastrointestinal 
illnesses which we know are more common in the winter months 
becerra said 
obviously if theres a correlation with respiratory 
infections or gi infections its patently reasonable that maybe 
the infection there is responsible said dr alfred 
steinschneider president of the atlantabased american sids 
institute 
we know babies who die of sids must have an underlying 
chronic abnormality he said respiratory infections or gi 
illnesses might act as a trigger to convert the predisposition to 
die into death 
nationwide the sids rate is 13 deaths for every 10000 live 
births according to cdc analyzing infant death statistics from 
1980 to 1987 the cdc also reported that sids rates were nearly 
twice as high for black babies as white babies and half again as 
high for baby boys as for baby girls 
the rate was highest for infants in the west and lowest in the 
northeast 
broken down by age sids rates were highest between 1 and 4 
completed months of life the sids risk peaks at 2 months 144 
percent higher or more than double the risk just two months 
later 
meanwhile sids risk peaked in december january and february 
the risk in july was 50 percent lower than that in january the 
highest month 
steinschneider stressed however that sids occurs all year 
often among premature or underweight babies 
what is important he said is a very practical thing get 
darned good prenatal care

a shift in public awareness along with stricter 
laws and enforcement may be why drunkendriving fatalities 
decreased 12 percent in seven years a new federal study shows 
in 1989 392 percent of traffic deaths involved at least one 
person who was legally drunk down from 463 percent in 1982 the 
national centers for disease control reported thursday 
in actual numbers 17849 americans died in such accidents in 
1989 down 12 percent from 20356 in 1982 
reasons for the improvement may include increased public 
distaste for drunken drivers changes in state laws penalizing 
drunken driving increased enforcement and higher drinking ages 
the cdc concluded 
its probably a combination of things not the least of which 
is public awareness said a science researcher with the national 
highway traffic safety administration who cited an administration 
policy and asked not to be named 
in the early 80s we had big decreases which had to do with 
the peaks in public awareness he said then new laws 
kicked in along with the 21 drinking age and theres been a 
steady decrease based upon those laws 
the cdc also reported that 242 percent of drivers involved in 
fatal crashes in 1989 were legally drunk down from 30 percent in 
1982 the numbers showed 14644 drunken drivers involved in fatal 
crashes in 1989 down 13 percent from 16793 in 1982 
the declines have been fairly steady throughout the 80s 
in 1989 the nation recorded 45555 traffic fatalities in 
addition to the 17849 or 392 percent involving a drunken 
driver pedestrian or cyclist another 4566 or 10 percent 
involved at least one person who had been drinking but wasnt 
legally drunk 
the atlantabased cdc noted that the percentage of fatalities in 
crashes involving someone drinking but not drunk has remained 
fairly constant between 100 percent and 111 percent in each of 
the eight years studied 
a total of 23140 or 508 percent involved no parties with a 
bloodalcohol reading 
meanwhile of the 60398 drivers involved in fatal crashes in 
1989 242 percent or 14644 were drunk the cdc reported 
another 4540 or 75 percent had been drinking while 41214 or 
682 percent hadnt been

the ford foundation has awarded 25 million in 
grants to help community college students successfully transfer to 
fouryear schools granting bachelors degrees 
some of the money will also support efforts to increase the 
number of minority and female administrators at community colleges 
said franklin a thomas the foundations president he announced 
the grants thursday 
only about 15 percent of community college students successfully 
transfer to fouryear institutions thomas said adding the grants 
are aimed especially at increasing the number of minority students 
who do so 
the bulk of the ford grant 2 million will go to the american 
council on educations national center for academic achievement and 
transfer it will distribute the funds to pairs of two and 
fouryear institutions to establish joint curricula and take other 
steps to smooth the transition for students 
the washingtonbased council which represents some 1800 
colleges and other institutions will name the schools getting 
grants in april 
four pairs will receive 200000 each to create joint core 
curricula to ensure community college students are prepared to 
transfer 
ten other pairs will get 25000 grants to help them establish 
partnerships aimed at fostering the skills necessary for minority 
youngsters to advance from community colleges to fouryear schools 
the rest of the grant to ace will be used to collect information 
on transfer rates to produce publications on those rates and to 
support the center 
this initiative will encourage two and fouryear institutions 
to work together so more community college students can earn the

unlike most of us patrick j fay never 
worries about making a panicky latenight dash to the drugstore to 
find replacement bulbs for his burntout christmas tree lights 
when the lights go out fay doesnt curse the darkness 
instead he chuckles and descends to his cozy basement where 
his antique collection of 700 or 800 tree lights all in good 
working order and about 2000 ornaments is safely stored 
he has so many in fact that his suburban washington dc 
home boasts not one but three christmas trees their branches 
sagging under the weight of brightly colored baubles and twinkling 
blinking bulbs 
ive gone a little overboard on the lights he says smiling 
ruefully i have so many lights that i feel guilty not using them 
all so we change them and the ornaments every week or so we have 
everchanging trees 
the trees are artificial the better to withstand all the 
changing of lights and ornaments and because they dont require 
watering they are put up the day after thanksgiving and sometimes 
arent taken down until midjanuary he says 
fays oldest ornament is a teardropshaped red and silver 
kugel or witchs ball made in germany of molded blown 
glass in the 1870s it is nestled in the branches of a rare old 
german feather tree 
the feather tree looks like a real though somewhat scraggly 
pine tree it consists of greendyed goose feather needles 
wired to the thin metal branches of a tall wooden stick many 
german immigrants folded these cherished holiday artifacts into 
their luggage and brought them to america in the 1800s fay said 
his rarest set of christmas tree lights is an eightbulb string 
of carbonfilament edison lamps stamped 1904 that was only a year 
after the small pearshaped bulbs first hit the us market as 
substitutes for the centuriesold tradition of tree candles 
at the turn of the century electric tree lights were only for 
the very rich fay said the bulbs cost about 1 each which 
was a tremendous sum in those days you had to have an electrician 
come to your home to wire them and they were screwed into a 
ceiling fixture 
the carbon filaments burned very hot and used a lot of 
electricity he said the bulbs overheated burned down trees 
and really made the meter go around 
they were replaced by cooler brighter tungstenfilament bulbs 
shortly after world war ii which also was the beginning of the 
golden era of fancy christmas tree ornaments 
fays trees are full of lavish glass baubles from germany 
beadedglass novelties from czechoslovakia tiny illuminated 
houses kewpie dolls in snowsuits dirigibles fruits and 
vegetables miniature airplanes and ocean liners 
there are spunglass butterflies doublefaced angels barnyard 
animals feathertailed peacocks windmills chicks popping out of 
eggshells and lights covered with revolving painted lampshades 
there are elaborately scissoredpaper dresdens from germany 
tree balls from world war ii with caps of cardboard instead of 
scarce tin bubble lights from the 1950s and midget lights from the 
1960s 
fay a 42yearold hotel banquet waiter began collecting 
christmas tree antiques more than a decade ago when he and his 
wife flora a real estate agent found a large box of quite 
rare quite expensive ornaments in the attic of a home they had 
just bought 
some people think im absolutely crazy but its a hobby that 
has grown by leaps and bounds he said 
we have friends and neighbors over for showandtell and they 
are always stunned the older ones always see something on the 
trees that reminds them of their youth

superpower diplomacy may yet rescue the tragic 
country of afghanistan after 12 years of war 1 million deaths and 
staggering devastation that has made refugees of 5 million people 
the children as is often the case in war have suffered the 
most 
about half of the dead and displaced are children infant 
mortality is extremely high rivaled only by the death rate in 
cambodia and sudan tuberculosis and malaria are the biggest 
killers inside the camps in pakistan and iran and within 
afghanistan itself 
this week the united states and the soviet union took some 
serious steps to end the fighting they agreed in principle to stop 
providing the combatants with weapons and decided an election 
should be held under international supervision 
there is a wide area of agreement between us secretary of 
state james a baker iii said after talks with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze but he said there are still 
questions that have to be answered 
among them is the scope of an assistance program to rehabilitate 
the country the job is immense 
the fragile afghan social fabric has been torn apart writer 
selig s harrison said in his recent book after the wars 
more than 100000 of the countrys educated elite have resettled 
abroad tensions among diverse ethnic groups have been exacerbated 
as the soviet union pakistan saudi arabia and other outsiders 
sought to manipulate the outcome of the war to suit their own 
interests 
the soviets wanted a client state pakistan which had inherited 
part of the country lopped off by british imperialists wanted a 
government in kabul it could influence and the saudis used their 
wealth to try to swing afghanistan into the moslem camp 
the united states recognizing even before the cold war thawed 
that the soviet union would not put up with having a hostile regime 
on its border dubbed the guerrillas freedom fighters and armed 
them to combat soviet influence 
apart from the 1 million deaths the war has left 700000 widows 
and orphans and 535000 disabled veterans destroyed onethird of 
the countrys villages and twothirds of its paved roads and 
created 2 million internal refugees out of a prewar population of 
ll7 million 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev withdrew the red army last 
year after more than nine years of warfare against guerrillas armed 
by the united states pakistan and saudi arabia 
many us analysts assumed president najibullahs promoscow 
government would collapse 
they underestimated his skills and also the frictions among the 
guerrillas some of whom are controlled by pakistan and inclined to 
a moslem fundamentalism at odds with democratic principles 
gorbachevs move did not remove the superpowers from the 
conflict however 
the soviets provide the kabul government with about 500 million 
a year in military assistance the united states and saudi arabia 
each help the guerrillas with about 300 million in weapons and 
other military aid 
the improvement in ussoviet relations is having a positive 
impact on regional conflicts like the one in afghanistan for 
instance the two powers are cooperating to try to end the fighting 
in cambodia and angola 
afghanistan which was founded in 1747 was ruled by kings until 
zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 a marxist coup in 1978 touched 
off a war that continues to tear the country apart 
in the meantime the united nations has launched a 
reconstruction program us contributions have been dwarfed by 
some other nations 455 million compared for instance with a 
600 million soviet pledge and 145 million by japan 
ekrem birerdinc who coordinates the un childrens fund 
program for afghanistan described the awful impact of the war in 
an interview thursday 
most of the children in refugee camps in pakistan and iran were 
born there they dont know their own country their own 
culture he said 
the childrens fund and other organizations have managed to 
immunize about 60 percent of the children against killer diseases 
within afghanistan he estimated only about 20 percent are 
immunized 
we cannot reach the children inside because the war is going 
on and there are clashes he said 
three million children are not going to school birerdinc said 
contributing to an army of illiterates 
literacy in afghanistan was always a problem before the war 
only 3 percent of the afghan women had been taught to read and 
write 
what you need to do now is to rebuild the whole country 
birerdinc said if the war stops then we can say it is not the 
bomb it is the water you are drinking that is hurting you

seven former persian gulf hostages got a 
festive white house welcome even as images of the destruction they 
had left behind lingered in their minds 
the newly freed captives met with president bush for an hour 
thursday and five tagged along as he lit the national christmas 
tree in a nearby park they provided a united vote of confidence 
for bushs efforts to free kuwait from iraq 
to a man we were in agreement with the care and the diligence 
which is being taken by the president said ralph montgomery who 
spent four months hiding in kuwait 
the hostages urged bush to see that the international coalition 
against iraq stands firm said montgomery the 57yearold 
architect from indian rocks beach fla hid with his soninlaw 
who was a teacher at the american school in kuwait 
montgomery praised his sons palestinian neighbors for 
protecting them throughout the ordeal gunfire and explosions could 
frequently be heard nearby he said 
antonio mireles who holed up at the us embassy compound in 
kuwait said the hostages told bush the kuwaitis are a peaceloving 
people and what has happened here cannot be left unattended 
it was atrocious what occurred here 
even if i do not go back i would like them to get their 
country back he said mireles 48 was a civil engineer working 
for the kuwaiti government 
ernest alexander who was in hiding in kuwait said bushs 
policies and his efforts on behalf of the hostages were one of 
the things that heartened us while the captives awaited freedom 
alexander a 38yearold lawyer who had lived in kuwait for 
several years said that two weeks ago he never would have expected 
to back in the united states before christmas he suggested it 
bodes well for further progress on the gulf crisis 
maybe hell blink alexander said referring to iraqi 
president saddam hussein 
bush called his session with the hostages and some of their 
relatives a very moving experience and rejected the idea that 
saddam should get a reward for letting them go 
hell no not one thing the president said you dont 
reward a kidnapper you dont reward somebody who has done 
something he shouldnt have done in the first place 
asked if he expected to be able to defuse the tensions in the 
persian gulf bush snapped one way or another we will 
what this man saddam put the world through i just cant 
express it and i think you all expressed it coming home with a 
clarity that has brought this home to the american people bush 
told the hostages 
the president met with the hostages as 32 of their countrymen 
left the persian gulf on thursday on what could be the last us 
charter flight out the group included the us ambassador to 
kuwait nathaniel howell and his staff 
they were arriving this afternoon at andrews air force base 
outside washington 
the besieged diplomats left the embassy only after they were 
satisfied that all americans had been given a chance to leave the 
country us officials said an estimated 500 americans many of 
them children with dual citizenship have decided to remain in 
iraq and kuwait 
the other hostages who met thursday with bush were four men who 
were held as socalled human shields at sensitive iraqi 
installations bill rodebush of mcalester okla john cole of 
odessa texas glenn coleman of boston and robert hanby of

secretary of state james a baker iii told his 
soviet counterpart this week that heavyhanded measures to enforce 
control of the economy and in the restive baltic republics could 
jeopardize a massive us aid package us officials say 
baker made the point privately to foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze as the soviet described moscows drive to assert 
central authority in a country beset by economic problems and 
separatist movements a knowledgeable official said 
i wouldnt describe it as a major warning the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said thursday night 
the conversation occurred in houston before president bushs 
announcement wednesday that he would help the soviets meet 
anticipated winter shortages by approving up to 1 billion in 
federally guaranteed loans for purchases of food and other 
agricultural goods 
baker a former treasury secretary and shevardnadze often 
candidly discuss the soviets attempt to reconstruct their economy 
and the hardships encountered along the way said officials who 
recounted the conversations 
shevardnadze explained how the central government was trying to 
tighten control of the distribution of food to make sure it gets to 
the marketplace 
the foreign minister said one problem was coping with profiteers 
who buy food at prices set by the government and then sell it 
sometimes at 10 times what they paid to consumers trying to 
overcome shortages 
without approving profiteering baker told shevardnadze its one 
thing to maintain order and another to use a heavy hand to root out 
attempts to stifle a market economy 
baker said a violent crackdown in dealing with the independence 
movements in estonia latvia and lithuania could strain the 
improved ussoviet relationship and that bushs assistance 
program might be jeopardized the officials said 
bakers advice came in a general discussion and shevardnadze did 
not take it as a confrontation the officials said 
shevardnadze requested us assistance from baker on tuesday in 
houston the aid package announced by bush the next day at the 
white house exceeded shevardnadzes request according to us 
officials who briefed reporters afterward 
bush lifted a 16yearold ban on guaranteed credits said he 
would propose that the world bank and the international monetary 
fund give the soviets a special association and offered help in 
dealing with transportation problems 
none of the us aid is in the form of a gift and baker stressed 
at a news conference in houston that it was temporary and that the 
soviets eventually would have to depend on their own vast 
resources

the national rifle association is pushing a 
suit that would overturn a government ban on civilian ownership of 
new machine guns but police groups supporting gun control want the 
supreme court to ignore it 
machine guns are designed to kill large groups of people and 
do so quickly don cahill of the national fraternal order of 
police said during a thursday news conference drug dealers and 
others bent on violence are the only ones who need machine guns 
at issue is a 1986 amendment to the gun control act 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms says the amendment 
prohibits private ownership of machine guns made after may 18 
1986 still legal is civilian possession of the 125000 privately 
owned machine guns made before then and the transfer of those older 
weapons as long as new owners obtain atfs approval 
to own an old machine gun a person must be fingerprinted 
undergo a background check obtain endorsement from the local 
police chief or sheriff and pay a 200 fee per weapon 
but nra attorney richard e gardiner said the government is 
misinterpreting the 1986 legislation 
what it says is that any machine gun made after that date can 
be possessed under the authority of the united states 
gardiner said in an interview 
while the government said it limits ownership of new machine 
guns to law enforcement agencies and the military gardiner said it 
means ownership is open to anyone meeting atf standards such as 
those established for individuals buying the older weapons 
theres a section in the gun control act that specifically 
exempts all government agencies from the act the nra lawyer 
said it would be meaningless for congress to create two 
exemptions for the same people 
the nra is supporting a case brought by gunsmith jd farmer jr 
of smyrna ga against atf director stephen e higgins 
farmer wanted to make and own a machine gun and he gave atf all 
the documents needed for possession of an old weapon the bureau 
rejected the application saying the 1986 legislation was the sole 
reason for doing so according to farmers petition to the supreme 
court 
us district judge j owen forrester of atlanta ruled in 
farmers favor in january 1989 but a threemember panel of the 
11th circuit court of appeals unanimously overturned that decision 
on july 11 1990 
the supreme court has not decided whether to hear farmers 
appeal the center to prevent handgun violence and seven police 
organizations submitted a brief thursday urging the top court not 
to take the case 
a great deal is at stake dennis a henigan director of the 
center to prevent handgun violence legal action project said at 
the news conference if the supreme court were to endorse 
anything close to the nras doctrine it would threaten every 
sensible gun law in this country 
district of columbia police chief isaac fulwood speaking for 
the international association of chiefs of police said it is 
absolutely vital that the sale and possession of new machine guns 
stay illegal machine guns have no place in civilized 
society 
david b mitchell police chief of prince georges county md 
noted that more than a dozen cities have already broken alltime 
murder records and many others are approaching these frightening 
marks 
mitchell representing the police executive research forum 
said every concerned american must truly believe that gun 
violence will escalate even more if these military weapons are 
available again to the general public 
but gardiner rejected the idea that drug dealers and other 
lawbreakers would rush to buy new machine guns theyre not the 
kind of people who like to submit forms to the federal 
government he said 
other groups asking the supreme court to reject the farmer case 
were the national association of police organizations the national 
organization of black law enforcement executives the major city 
chiefs and the police foundation

blood and law in the form of advice from his 
brother convinced william bennett he should reverse himself and 
reject the chairmanship of the republican national committee 
bennetts brother robert is the special counsel investigating 
one of congress most sensitive ethics cases the propriety of 
five senators actions on behalf of financier charles h keating 
jr a major contributor 
and from brother bills perspective that case and his own are 
not totally unrelated bennett in an interview thursday said he 
asked his brother whether he should take the top gop position 
he said my advice to you is not to take this job bennett 
said i said is it a close call and he said 9010 
bennett who resigned in november as national drug policy 
director is not supposed to lobby or come into extensive contact 
with the white house for a year after leaving the administration 
he also was told by white house lawyers that he would have to 
give up a book contract and other outside income i didnt take a 
vow of poverty bennett told reporters as he rejected the rnc job 
he had accepted from president bush two weeks earlier 
the surprise development was an embarrassment to bush and 
bennett the white house now must find a new candidate to take over 
daytoday party operations from the ailing lee atwater 
the rnc position which would involve constant contact with the 
administration as well as raising money from many individuals and 
groups with special interests falls into a murky area 
some lawyers say there would be no conflict but others 
including robert bennett predicted trouble 
bob said to me look youll be very public in your views 
youll be controversial people will want to target you and if they 
can find some vulnerability theyll be looking for it bennett 
recounted 
complicating the ethics tangle was the fact that bennett would 
have had to repay his book advance listed at 187500 on financial 
disclosure forms 
bennett reported receiving 240000 in speaking fees during the 
four months between his resignation as education secretary in 
september 1988 and when he was given the drug czar job in january 
but he said he would be hardpressed to repay the advance 
i would have to earn that money by consulting and giving 
speeches i would be engaged in activity which i am precluded from 
doing for a year he said 
white house counsel c boyden gray decided this week that 
bennett would violate the nocontact law if he took money beyond 
his 125100ayear rnc paycheck gray told the associated press he 
had warned bennett all along that his speeches would have to be 
restricted 
at the time it was hypothetical who he would speak to gray 
said of his initial advice but he said bennett subsequently lined 
up speaking engagements with industry and trade groups that had 
direct interests in lobbying the administration on policy matters 
the question here is not strictly legal its a question of 
appearance a question of prudence and ultimately a question of 
politics gray said 
bennett however maintained that the advice from the white 
house changed in his view his green light had turned red and he 
turned to his brother 
thats when things became very clear he said i have been 
at this for nine years and i have a reputation for being a lot of 
things but no one has ever raised any questions about propriety or 
ethics and i will not allow them to be raised 
one administration source familiar with the situation said gray 
had cautioned bennett early on about the risks of appearance of 
impropriety but backed off under pressure from white house chief 
of staff john sununu who wanted bennett to be able to take the 
job the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
bennett 47 is a fellow at the hudson institute a conservative 
political research organization his publishing contract with simon 
amp schuster calls for him to write two books 
a couple of cabinet members have been mentioned as potential rnc 
chairmen and bennett said they probably would not be under 
financial pressure to make outside money through speeches or 
consulting 
but he said the white house contact and fundraising duties 
alone could prove risky to anyone coming from the administration

the nuclear regulatory commission is 
reducing the amount of radiation to which workers at atomic plants 
and nearby residents may be exposed but critics contend the new 
ceilings already are outdated and inadequate 
the nrcs action on thursday represents the first broad 
revamping of radiation exposure limits for nuclear plant workers in 
33 years officials said it reflects new scientific findings on 
radiation risks 
radiation exposure to most atomic workers and people living near 
nuclear facilities already is well within the new requirements and 
few operational changes are expected said donald cool chief of 
the nrcs radiation protection and health effects branch 
the nrc has debated tighter controls on radiation exposure at 
nuclear facilities for a decade the final action comes 13 years 
after an international scientific advisory group recommended lower 
exposure ceilings levels identical to those required by the new 
rules 
under the new nrc requirements atomic plant workers may be 
exposed to no more than 5 rems of radiation per year and exposure 
to the general public may be no more than 100 millirems per year 
about onefifth of the current limit 
a rem which is the standard measure of radiation equals 1000 
millirems the nrc rules affect commercial nuclear power plants 
various laboratories and facilities involved in uranium production 
according to government studies people on average are exposed 
from normal background radiation and medical treatments to about 
360 millirems of radiation annually radiation from an xray is 
about 6 to 7 millirems 
the average exposure to plant workers is about 400 millirems a 
year and there has been no case reported where members of the 
general population have been exposed to levels anywhere near the 
new 100millirem ceiling said nrc spokesman joe fouchard 
critics however accused the nrc of not going far enough and of 
issuing new rules that will be outdated before they even go into 
effect beginning in 1993 
the nrcs lower radiation exposure levels reflect 
recommendations made as early as 1977 by the international 
commission on radiological protection a key scientific advisory 
body 
however the same group announced last summer that it considers 
its 1977 recommendations to be outdated the group is expected 
shortly to recommend maximum radiation exposure levels for atomic 
workers of 2 rems per year 
the lower ceiling is based on a number of recent studies on 
radiation health risks including one by the national academy of 
sciences earlier this year that put cancer risks from radiation two 
to five times greater than a similar study did in 1980 
the commission is straining its credibility by adopting an 
obsolete standard said michael mariotte executive director of 
the nuclear information and resource service an antinuclear 
umbrella group 
the nrc in explaining the regulatory change said the new 
requirements reflect changes in the basic philosophy of radiation 
protection and take into account recent scientific studies on the 
risks of radiation 
the commission said it didnt believe the imposition of even 
lower radiation exposure ceiling for nuclear workers is needed 
because actual contamination of most workers already is much lower 
than the 5remperyear standard being proposed 
in 1987 97 percent of all workers at nuclear plants and other 
atomic facilities were exposed to less than 2 rems of radiation 
annually the nrc said 
the new regulations also establish tighter standards that apply 
to pregnant workers at atomic facilities limiting exposure to 500 
millirems over the duration of the pregnancy and require that 
plants adopt formal policies to keep radiation doses as low as 
reasonably achievable

the far side of the moon last 
photographed by apollo astronauts two decades ago was captured on 
film again by the galileo spacecraft when it zoomed past the earth 
on its long voyage to jupiter 
its staggering to realize weve been neglecting our own 
satellite said torrence johnson galileos chief scientist at 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
astronauts with the 19691972 apollo lunar missions photographed 
the back side of the moon but johnson said thursday the last good 
pictures before galileo were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during 
the 1960s 
galileo passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the 
southwest atlantic ocean on saturday it used earths gravity as a 
slingshot to help expand the spacecrafts orbit around the sun so 
it can reach jupiter in 1995 it used venus for the same purpose 
last february and will fly past earth again in december 1992 
the planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel galileo 
on its 14 billion mission to jupiter but scientists took the 
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study venus and earth in dress 
rehearsals for exploring jupiter 
three of galileos new photographs of the moon and earth were 
released thursday by the national aeronautics and space 
administration as galileo zoomed away from earth snapping more 
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 233 million miles 
one photo shows the crescent moon while another shows mare 
orientale a 550milewide meteorite impact crater on the far side 
of the moon which is always pointed away from earth because of 
the way the moon orbits earth only fiveeighths of its surface can 
be seen from earth 
galileos third picture shows half of antarctica including the 
ross ice shelf and mountains poking through ice near mcmurdo sound 
this is the first time weve had a chance to use a spacecraft 
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own 
earth and moon as if we were alien observers johnson said 
in the process were learning some new scientific things 
about our own world and its companion but perhaps more 
importantly its providing us a different perspective on our own 
home planet as a fragile world he said 
galileo is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to 
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for 
the first time said clark chapman a researcher from the planetary 
science institute in tucson ariz 
were going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side 
of the moon chapman said its been a fantastic lunar mission 
already 
nasa plans to release more pictures wednesday and hopes to 
display a movie made of 1400 still images showing clouds moving 
above the spinning earth 
some unreleased pictures were displayed thursday during a nasa 
closedcircuit television broadcast they showed closeup views of 
clouds drifting above australia and more distant peeks at asia 
india baja california and the andes 
galileo was launched from space shuttle atlantis on oct 18 
1989 
it was to have been sent on a direct twoyear flight to 
jupiter but after the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle 
challenger nasa decided it was too risky to launch galileo from 
the shuttle using a powerful liquidfueled rocket a weaker booster 
was used requiring galileo to use the gravity of venus and earth 
to make a looping 24billionmile sixyear voyage

twelve people taking part in a ceremony 
to call up spirits were found dead thursday in a home in this 
mexican border city seven others found sprawled on the floor in a 
circle formed by rope were in serious condition said a baja 
california police spokeswoman 
one officer said the 19 men women and children were the 
apparent victims of a mass suicide attempt by poison others said 
it could be an accidental asphyxiation or poisoning 
relatives of the victims said they had previously attended 
healing rites in the house that were a mixture of christianity and 
spiritualism which involves calling the spirits of the dead for 
consultation 
they were holding a session in which they communicated with 
the spirits said tijuana state judicial police commander jaime 
sam fierro 
he said the victims might have been poisoned by butane gas 
which is used in mexico for home heating or stoves or by 
something they ate or drank an autopsy is to be completed friday 
said police spokeswomen sara yolanda gonzalez in mexicali the 
state capital 
authorities said the deaths could have been caused by 
industrialstrength alcohol believed to be in a fruit punch 
participants shared during the ceremony the los angeles times 
reported friday 
we believe weve ruled out both suicide and homicide jose 
nunez de caceres a commander of the baja california state police 
told the times 
officers were conducting tests on the punch and a bowl of cooked 
chicken found in the house where the 12 bodies were found gonzalez 
said police said a witness told them the house smelled strongly of 
gas when the bodies were discovered thursday morning she said 
police said the group leader and house owner federico padres 
72 was among four survivors in a coma one of the survivors was an 
18monthold baby 
authorities found the bodies some piled upon each other on 
couches chairs and the floor of the wellkept house in the florido 
neighborhood a poor district of shanties and squatter camps 
a rope with 13 knots tied in it was laid in a circle on the 
living room floor around four or five of the bodies said officers 
who saw the inside of the house 
neighbors said chanting had filtered from the house over the 
past several nights the last time starting wednesday night and 
continuing into the morning 
officer jorge gamala quoted a neighbor as saying she had 
overheard people at the house talking about when they were going to 
do it 
she overheard them say that their god was waiting for them and 
they had to get it done by the end of the year gamala said 
a young woman who lives in the house reported the bodies to 
state judicial police gonzalez said 
the woman ana faviola miranda 17 said padres frequently held 
healing ceremonies there and held one wednesday night gonzalez 
said 
miranda said she went home at 8 pm wednesday and padres told 
her to leave and come back later according to police 
when she returned at 855 pm she said the house smelled 
strongly of gas police reports said they said padres told her to 
wait outside 
from padres car where she waited miranda said she heard 
shouts and whining but didnt do anything because she was used to 
that kind of carrying on gonzalez said 
after spending the night in the car miranda asked a neighbor 
for help and the two entered the house through a window the woman 
testified 
upon seeing the bodies miranda said she thought the ceremony 
participants were asleep or in a trance gonzalez said 
gonzalez said miranda informed police at 11 am thursday 
police said they found four men seven women and a 6yearold 
girl dead 
padres and mirandas mother gloria miranda 38 were among the 
dead gonzalez said she said police had not yet identified the 
rest of the dead 
according to a report by kfmbtv of san diego mexican state 
judicial police said they believe the victims had ingested poison 
the victims the report said suffered a purplish discoloration of 
the skin

white house fears of unduly alarming the public have delayed 
until next week the release of an environmental protection agency 
report linking electromagnetic fields to leukemia and brain cancer 
in children the epa says 
the report which was to have been released last month 
suggests but does not prove that electromagnetic fields can cause 
cancer epa officials said thursday 
d allan bromley a white house science adviser and james o 
mason assistant secretary of health and human services told epa 
officials they were concerned the public would misinterpret the 
reports conclusions 
they were concerned not about the accuracy of the report 
said robert mcgaughy who supervised the reports preparation 
they were concerned about how people would react to the news 
there is a concern that people will take too seriously the 
suggestions that there may be some connection with cancer 
neither bromley nor mason were available for interviews 
thursday their offices said 
some epa scientists were angry about the delay said david 
bayliss one of the reports authors it initially was scheduled 
for release nov 27 he said 
what is the use of having an environmental protection agency 
if youre going to withhold information from the public bayliss 
said i thought the epa was for letting people know about health 
problems or possible health problems 
the report looked at all kinds of electromagnetic fields from 
those produced by highpower electrical transmission lines to those 
produced by household applinces 
virtually everyone is exposed to such fields every day 
epidemiological or statistical studies have linked residential 
exposures to childhood cancer and studies have linked occupational 
exposures to cancer in adults said david savitz of the university 
of north carolina in chapel hill the author of one of the most 
important of those studies 
laboratory experiments have suggested that living cells can 
respond to electromagnetic fields and researchers have hypotheses 
as to why the fields might cause cancer savitz said 
there are credible scientific suggestions of adverse health 
effects from these exposures but the overall body of evidence is 
not conclusive he said 
the epa report is a review of all existing studies on 
electromagnetic fields and cancer a draft prepared last summer 
concluded that the studies show a consistent pattern of response 
which suggests but does not prove a causal link between 
household power distribution systems and certain cancers in 
children 
the childrens cancers were leukemia brain cancer and lymphoma 
the report said 
the draft has been revised once but our current conclusions 
are very similar mcgaughy said 
mcgaughy said questions raised by bromley at a meeting nov 26 
with mcgaughy and other epa officials in bromleys office delayed 
the reports scheduled release the following day 
mason expressed similar objections dec 6 mcgaughy said 
erich bretthauer the epas assistant administrator for research 
and development said both men were involved because an interagency 
federal committee that they oversee also is studying 
electromagnetic fields and health hazards 
bretthauer said the report will be released next week 
he said bromley and mason disagreed with the epa over nuances of 
the epidemiological studies considered in the report i dont 
think they see the data the way we do bretthauer said when 
asked to clarify the disagreements he said im going to refer 
you to them 
in an earlier version prepared last spring the agency 
tentatively proposed classifying electromagnetic fields as a 
class b1 carcinogen meaning that they are a probable source of 
human cancer 
but when it went through the peer review inside the agency 
that recommendation was taken out some say with malice and some 
say without said david janes a nowretired epa administrator 
who commissioned the study janes said he thought the epa report 
would have a great impact because of the nature of the risk i 
think it will create a lot of apprehension among folks especially 
since this is one of those you cant see it feel it or taste it 
and an individuals exposure is not under an individuals 
control

welcome to crunch time for state governments 
spending is up considerably but revenue isnt the result 
budget cuts or tax increases are in the offing in many states 
this is the worst ive ever seen it in mississippi said 
republican state sen dick hall the joyride had to end it just 
ended a year or so sooner than we thought it would 
halls comments echoed those of other state lawmakers attending 
a convention of the national conference of state legislatures this 
week 
amid a weakening national economy revenue in 25 states is far 
behind projections twothirds of state governments will have to 
cut budgets or raise taxes next year to balance their books a 
conference survey found 
corporate income tax collections in mississippi for instance 
have been running below earlier estimates for the past 14 months 
the state legislature and democratic gov ray mabus now must figure 
out how to cover a 100 million shortfall 
it promises to be an ugly fight because all legislative seats 
and the governorship are up for election next year in mississippi 
the amount of political posturing is bound to be greater than 
usual hall said 
nowhere are state finances more dismal than in the northeast 
connecticut faces a deficit of 562 million for the next six 
months plus a shortfall of 15 billion 20 percent of the budget 
for fiscal 1992 
when recession hit revenue in connecticut took a nosedive 
this is a rollercoaster tax structure that relies heavily 
on sales taxes said state rep mary mushinsky whose constituents 
are starting to experience layoffs connecticuts financial 
problems in the recession of the early 1980s were a small blip 
compared to the current difficulties she said 
govelect lowell weicker is considering a state income tax to 
fix the problem 
the economic slump is as serious as it was in 1982 and the 
slide seems to be progressing at a faster rate than in the 
early 80s maine house speaker john martin told reporters 
thursday 
each of the six new england states is a candidate for tax 
increases state legislative leaders reported 
the midwest wont escape the crunch either 
ohio faces a 262 million deficit and the legislature will meet 
next week to act on a package of budget cuts 
congress is contributing to the states woes state lawmakers 
complained at the conference rep dale kildee dmich got a 
hostile reception when he spoke to the legislators 
congress has revised programs such as medicaid and left it to 
the states to pay for the changes 
you lay all of these mandates on us and dont provide the 
money to pay for them ohio state sen richard finan told kildee 
finan a republican is chairman of the state senate ways and 
means committee and will be one of the major players as the ohio 
legislature tries to bridge the budget gap 
the coming months promise to be a battle royal in many state 
capitals 
in california govelect pete wilson faces a stern test 
dealing with a projected budget deficit of 800 million in the 
fastgrowing state 
wilson had better not try to cut needed services for lowincome 
people warned california state rep dianne watson who represents 
part of los angeles 
she pointed to the defeat the democraticcontrolled legislature 
handed republican gov george deukmejian this month it rejected 
his bid to reduce an income tax credit for renters a move that 
would have saved the state 200 million 
the situation is likely to get worse in california for the 
fiscal year starting next july revenue is expected to fall short 
of spending by 59 billion

a longawaited study of the soviet economy is 
unlikely to recommend a flood of direct western assistance when it 
is released next week bush administration officials said 
rather they said the report will provide the most detailed 
analysis to date of the problems besetting the soviet economy and 
recommend ways in which technical assistance can be provided to the 
soviets 
a senior treasury department official speaking on condition his 
name not be used said thursday that the report should provide 
the most comprehensive and timely assessment that has been seen on 
the soviet economy 
but the official said he did not expect the document to support 
any push for large amounts of western aid until the soviets make 
greater strides toward a marketbased economy 
the report which is expected to be released dec 20 was 
ordered by president bush and the leaders of japan germany 
britain france italy and canada last july in houston during the 
annual economic summit meeting of the worlds seven largest 
industrial countries 
the study has been conducted by the international monetary fund 
and its sister lending organization the world bank along with the 
parisbased organization for economic cooperation and development 
and the european bank for reconstruction and development a lending 
agency created this year to promote economic development in eastern 
europe 
the study represented a way at the houston summit to reach a 
compromise between the demands of the french and germans for an 
immediate 15 billion western aid package and resistance to direct 
economic aid by bush and the other summit leaders 
bush announced wednesday that he was granting the soviet union 
up to 13 billion in federal loan guarantees for the purchase of 
american food and manufactured goods 
he also promised to provide emergency medical supplies to the 
soviets and dispatch a team of us experts to provide technical 
advice on ways to unclog the soviet food distribution system 
while bushs announcement represented the biggest package the 
administration has been willing to come up with so far it stopped 
far short of the hefty direct financial assistance that some 
european countries notably germany are providing to the soviets 
the 13 billion in credit guarantees is not a direct 
expenditure by the us government instead the government is 
promising to stand behind the loans that commercial banks make to 
the soviets to finance the purchase of american farm and 
manufactured products 
as part of the aid package bush also directed treasury 
secretary nicholas brady to present a proposal to the imf and the 
world bank to grant the soviets the status of a special 
associate at the two giant multinational lending institutions 
that designation falls far short of the full membership the 
soviets covet only full members of the imf and the world bank 
qualify for the billions of dollars in loans the two institutions 
make each year 
but the administration argued that the designation of special 
associate would serve as an important waystation for the soviets 
and did not preclude their admission as full members of the two 
organizations later 
in the meantime the initial ties with the imf and the world 
bank would allow the soviets to tap the considerable expertise the 
two agencies have in a variety of financial areas such as how to 
establish a stable currency system 
there is a tremendous experience and education gap and we hope 
this will fill that gap the treasury official said 
while the initial reaction among other western countries has 
been favorable to the us proposals the treasury official said 
more consultations would be necessary before putting the plan into 
operation 
but he indicated the details should be wrapped up fairly 
quickly possibly at an expected meeting in january of brady and 
finance ministers from the six other major industrialized 
countries

expect to read one day soon that a us 
company will pay millions of dollars to the soviet union for the 
privilege of having an american ride to the space station mir 
the deal has been made say two officials of space commerce 
corp in houston which markets soviet space services in the united 
states but they wont identify the company or how much was paid 
or why 
the contract and its purpose and the name of the american 
cosmonauttobe wasnt supposed to be revealed until january but 
the weekly newspaper space news printed sketchy details monday 
space news said only that the unknown companys cost will be 
more than the 12 million paid by the tokyo broadcasting service to 
the glavkosmos space agency for japanese journalist toyohiro 
akiyamas ride 
we executed a contract with npo energia which is the manned 
part of the soviet space program said art dula one of the space 
commerce corp officials but he said the contract forbids him 
from saying any more 
the soviets for a hefty price have transported passengers of 
a variety of nationalities to their space station for stays of 
varying duration they have included a frenchman a cuban an east 
german and japans akiyama 
but theres never been an american 
dulas associate bill wirin of colorado springs colo said 
space commerce corp signed the deal in moscow on nov 30 
our company policy is that we never discuss what we are doing 
without approval from our partners he said 
wirin called the contract another sign of the warming 
relationship between the soviets and the united states on a 
commercial basis at a time when the us is talking about giving 
them food 
wirin like dula said hed like to say more but he referred 
calls to brown nelson and associates a houston public relations 
company 
this company has a big announcement to make but the plan was 
to make that announcement in january said guy brown one of the 
principals in the company 
the client doesnt want to be disclosed by name its an 
american company id like to disclose more but im under a 
restriction from them he said 
brown said the unidentified company would select the american 
cosmonaut 
one check has passed hands probably earnest money brown 
said its pretty much a fait accompli

its coming out over budget behind schedule 
and 16 years after its predecessor but paramount executives are 
betting the godfather part iii will be a movie audiences cant 
refuse 
after a frantic month of roundtheclock editing and polishing 
the final film in francis ford coppolas mafia trilogy was unveiled 
wednesday to critics and movie theater owners in new york san 
francisco los angeles and other key markets across the country 
the response was mixed disappointment ran higher among new york 
viewers while those who watched in los angeles applauded 
the movie will open on christmas day on 1800 screens in the 
united states and canada it originally was scheduled for a 
thanksgiving release but was moved back because of production 
delays 
for a while it was uncertain whether godfather iii would be 
released at all this year paramount pictures gunning for the 
lucrative holiday market decided to rush it out at the end of the 
year after chairman frank mancuso and other executives saw a rough 
cut in october 
without question this is the one everybodys talking about 
said john krier president of exhibitor relations co inc ever 
since dick tracy all the talk has been about godfather 
with preview screenings held this week the movie qualifies for 
this years award consideration from the academy of motion picture 
arts and sciences and los angeles film critics association 
the 58 million film triple the industrys average cost was 
burdened with problems throughout production reallife lovers al 
pacino and diane keaton reprising their roles as michael and kay 
corleone split up during the filming rising star winona ryder 
edward scissorhands was unable to costar as michaels 
lovestruck daughter because of exhaustion 
she was replaced at the last minute by coppolas daughter sofia 
who had never had a major film role before 
the first two godfather films are considered masterpieces of 
american cinema and either made or solidified the careers of some 
of todays leading actors including pacino keaton robert de 
niro james caan robert duvall and talia shire 
the first godfather made 1337 million in 1972 and its 1974 
sequel had ticket sales of 455 million both films won best 
picture and screenplay oscars marlon brando won the academy award 
for best actor in the first installment and coppola for 
directing and robert de niro supporting actor won oscars for the 
second 
in the latest sequel set in 1979 michael corleone attempts to 
bury his gangland roots but realizes just when i thought i was 
out they pull me back in 
despite a 100 million gift to the catholic church and induction 
into an honorary church order michael soon finds himself plotting 
vatican politics and sicilian executions 
in a climactic scene filmed during a performance of the opera 
cavalleria rusticana at italys historic teatro massimo opera 
house coppola intercuts between the melodious performance and 
grisly murders 
reviewers in new york were largely critical of godfather 
iii complaining that at two hours and 42 minutes it was too long 
and that it lacked a hard edge and keen focus its ending meant to 
evoke feelings of tragedy was greeted with laughter 
but los angeles critics applauded robustly as the final credits 
rolled movie exhibitors who saw a separate screening generally 
expressed satisfaction 
the consensus is its a very satisfying sequel to the two 
previous godfathers said dan harkins of harkins amusement 
enterprises which will show the film in arizona theaters but 
im not sure its as brilliant as the first one 
paramount which has had an upanddown year at the box office 
is counting on godfather iii to deliver a hefty share of 
holiday ticket sales 
other recent films by coppola including tucker the man and 
his dream and one from the heart were flops 
such 1990 paramount releases as another 48 hrs and the 
two jakes also performed badly but paramounts ghost has 
been the years biggest moneymaker collecting more than 200 
million to date

prices fell moderately on the tokyo stock exchange 
friday while the dollar firmed against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average shed 29347 points or 119 
percent to settle at 2434950 points by the close of trading at 3 
pm 1 am est 
the dollar settled at 13187 yen up 57 yen from thursdays 
close the currency opened at 13209 yen and ranged between 13182 
yen and 13215 yen 
in bond dealings the price of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds was 8761 down from thursdays close of 
8782 the yield was 7145 percent compared with 7100 percent 
thursday 
traders described the decline in stock prices as a correction 
after a gain over the past seven trading days of 278036 points 
or 127 percent in the nikkei index the tokyo markets main 
barometer 
thursdays trading brought the index above 24000 points for the 
first time in nearly six weeks 
yesterday it went up too much said amy yip manager of 
sales for baring securities 
traders earlier attributed the recent bullish market to optimism 
about the possibility of averting war in the middle east lower 
crude oil prices and interest rates have also encouraged investors 
the correction friday might also prevent the market from 
becoming too tired to put on a strong rally toward the end of 
the year yip said 
weakness in fridays stock currency and bond markets also 
reflected some returning fears that the gulf crisis will not be as 
easy to solve as market players hoped at the beginning of the week 
she said 
action on the currency market is very quiet said minori 
takeuchi in the chemical bank currency dealing department 
market players are sidelined she said because of the 
upcoming holiday season and because market factors are mixed 
buyers are shying away from the dollar fearing that it will 
weaken because of the lagging us economy while renewed fears of 
war in the middle east have dimmed the attractiveness of the yen 
she said

usa today officials are considering publishing 
a weekly tabloid about baseball 
the decision will come by the end of the year tom curley 
president and chief operating officer of usa today said thursday 
he said a task force is looking into the possibility of such a 
publication with the tentative title usa today baseball weekly 
if the company decides to proceed with the publication it would 
be launched during spring training preceding the 1991 baseball 
season 
the tabloid would provide more statistics than can be published 
in the regular sports section of the fivedayaweek national 
newspaper curley said 
its a bit too soon to tell what else might be in the paper 
curley said 
there is an opportunity to provide more depth in all sorts of 
basic sports coverage from viewing to aarticipating to 
statistics he said 
james goss a newspaper business analyst at the new york 
investment firm of dustin phelps said sports coverage is 
considered one of usa todays strong points and the weekly would 
provide a way to get some more mileage out of what they are 
putting together anyway for the newspaper 
goss said also that the national the new yorkbased daily 
sports paper launched in a number of markets beginning last 
january might be cutting into usa today markets and this could be 
a factor in the decision 
curley however said thats old news by now he said the 
tabloid if it is launched might provide usa today with a sixth 
day in effect

european community leaders gathered today for a 
summit aimed at launching the trading bloc on the road to a 
federated europe britain the prime objector is in a more 
conciliatory mood since the resignation of margaret thatcher 
the 12 leaders beginning their twoday meeting today in the 
flagbedecked italian parliament also will consider granting a 24 
billion aid package to the soviet union and increased help to other 
east european countries 
the europeans received a new exhortation from president bush to 
stand firm on the persian gulf crisis 
in a letter thursday to italian premier giulio andreotti 
current holder of the rotating summit chairmanship bush said 
iraqs blanket release of foreign hostages should not lessen 
pressure on iraq to pull out of kuwait 
we must continue to maintain a very rigid attitude bush 
said according to italian officials 
british prime minister john major who succeeded mrs thatcher 
nov 28 and is virtually unknown to the other summiteers joined 
them at the opera for a performance of tosca on thursday night 
major 47 was holding separate prior talks with andreotti 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers and german chancellor helmut 
kohl 
kohl and french president francois mitterrand are pressing for 
economic union and a single currency perhaps by the year 2000 and 
for a form of political union that would strip member nations of 
many sovereign powers 
major keen to avoid a repeat of the britainversustherest 
showdown that helped topple mrs thatcher after the summit in rome 
in october was optimistic despite britains continued opposition 
to key unity proposals his aides said 
we see ways in which significant progress can be made a 
senior british source said thursday night 
but there are areas where we will reaffirm our positions quite 
clearly including our opposition to having a single currency 
imposed upon us he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the european parliament in strasbourg france on thursday urged 
the 12 ec heads of state to work on restarting talks to liberalize 
world trade 
the global trade negotiations broke down in brussels last week 
in part due to the ecs refusal to cut farm subsidies enough to 
satisfy the united states the talks are to resume at a lower level 
next month in geneva 
soviet aid which topped the agenda of this summit was given 
fresh impetus by the us decision wednesday to give the soviet 
union 1 billion in loan guarantees to buy american farm products 
and manufactured goods 
andreottis spokesman pio mastrobuoni said he was confident of 
agreement despite some arguments that the soviet union needs help 
in managing its huge resources including distributing its harvest 
rather than handouts and loans it will have trouble repaying 
on financial union andreotti cornered mrs thatcher at the 
october summit by getting the others to agree to establish a single 
central banking system the prelude to one currency by january 
1994 mrs thatcher objected loudly 
in a change of tone major planned to argue the british 
alternative of a european currency that would circulate alongside 
the 12 existing currencies without ruling out an eventual sole 
currency 
on political union britain has shifted toward french and german 
proposals for giving the ec a formal role in security 
and aides said major was confident britain will not be alone in 
opposing other proposals that would give the community farreaching 
powers over issues ranging from health social policy and education 
to taxation and transport 
the ec nations are italy france britain ireland spain 
portugal belgium luxembourg the netherlands greece denmark and 
germany

administration jobs but says he has found one post hed like the 
only trouble is it isnt vacant 
the minnesota republican who lost to democrat paul wellstone in 
the november election said thursday he would be interested in 
becoming secretary of agriculture should clayton yeutter leave that 
position 
i might very well consider that boschwitz said in a session 
with reporters from his home state 
boschwitz said the high point of his 12year senate career was 
his work on farm issues 
yeutter has denied rumors that he plans to return to private 
business now that the fiveyear farm bill has been completed and 
international trade talks have collapsed 
boschwitz said he planned to call yeutter to tell him he was not 
trying to take over the job 
i dont want people to feel im breathing down their neck 
boschwitz said i dont expect him to step down 
boschwitz met with president bush on tuesday to talk about his 
future plans bush has some major vacancies to fill but boschwitz 
said he would not be a candidate for any of them 
boschwitz said he was not qualified to be education secretary 
and might not be confirmed by the senate as labor secretary the 
chairmanship of the republican national committee also is open but 
boschwitz said that slot did not interest him

new laboratory studies suggest that some types 
of cells infected with the aids virus may release a poison that 
disrupts thinking processes and causes the mental decline seen in 
70 percent of aids patients 
weve found that one class of cells when infected with the 
aids virus will release a toxin that can disrupt the nervous 
system said dr dana giulian a researcher at the baylor college 
of medicine in houston 
a research paper on the discovery is to be published today in 
the journal science 
in an interview giulian said test tube experiments showed that 
monocytes an immune system cell in the blood will secrete poison 
molecules when infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv which causes aids 
when these molecules were exposed to neurons it would cause the 
nerve cells to either die or stop functioning giulian said 
this suggests said the researcher that similar cells in the 
brain called macrophages could react the same way when infected 
by hiv guilian said the finding must be confirmed by further 
research 
physicians and scientists have long been puzzled as to why aids 
patients develop mental decline 
the toxin secreted by the infected cells could be the answer 
giulian said the next job is to identify the secreted molecule 
that is toxic to the brain this he said may be a difficult job 
giulians coauthors of the science report were ken vaca and 
christine a noonan also of baylor 
science is the journal of the american association for the

despite the surge in oil prices since 
iraq invaded kuwait opec isnt about to give up its efforts to 
secure high revenues 
all the countries need money now opec president sadek 
boussena said thursday at the end of the cartels winter strategy 
session 
during the twoday meeting the ministers of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries agreed to continue 
pumping extra oil to meet any shortfall during the persian gulf 
crisis 
but saudi arabia and the other opec members also agreed to cut 
production once the crisis ends in doing so officials hope to 
avoid a sharp drop in prices that would hurt their struggling 
economies 
following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait opec agreed to 
suspend its quota system and increase pumping to make up for 4 
million barrels of iraqi and kuwaiti crude kept off the 
international market by a un embargo 
current opec production is around 23 million barrels a day and 
unlikely to go much higher 
we are producing more or less at the maximum level said 
boussena 
oil prices rallied thursday moving up about 1 per barrel to 
2642 on the new york mercantile exchange as traders renewed 
their focus on the possibility of war in the gulf oil was around 
20 a barrel just before the crisis 
higher prices during the crisis have brought millions of dollars 
into the coffers of oil producers some opec members such as 
algeria nigeria and ecuador badly need the money to support their 
impoverished economies 
saudi arabia opecs largest oil producer has contributed much 
of its windfall to nations suffering from the economic impact of 
the gulf crisis some of the money has also been used to help pay 
for the usled multinational force stationed on saudi soil 
boussena who is algerias mines minister hinted the cartel 
might consider lifting its target price above 21 a barrel after 
the crisis 
last july for the first time since 1986 the ministers raised 
the benchmark price from 19 a barrel 
i am certain people need more money it is clear it is stated 
by all of us said boussena 
after iraqs invasion of kuwait oil prices for a time topped 
40 on fears that an outbreak of war in the gulf could cut off 
crude oil supplies 
analysts say opecs aggressive production during the gulf crisis 
could lead to a glut on the market next year and plunging prices 
peter bogin associate director for oil markets at cambridge 
energy research associates in paris predicted that at winters 
end crude prices could slide below 20 a barrel 
demand for crude has eased because of the slumping american 
economy and warmerthanexpected weather in the united states and 
other consuming nations 
moreover industrialized nations have been filling their storage 
tanks to prepare for possible war and an oil cut off in the gulf 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

investigators are considering the unusual 
possibility that two female serial killers are responsible for the 
shooting deaths of eight middleaged male motorists and 
disappearances of two others in the past year 
authorities are reluctant to say publicly the deaths are 
related but they did distribute composite drawings of two women 
wanted for questioning 
all the known victims were white roughly between the ages of 40 
and 60 all were shot some repeatedly some were stripped naked 
and robbed their bodies dumped along rural roads 
one victims body was found in southern georgia the rest in 
various places around the northern half of florida the first body 
was found a year ago thursday 
two missing men also may be part of the bloody chain their 
abandoned cars have been recovered one vehicle belonging to a 
parttime missionary had traces of blood in it 
the suspects last were seen leaving an accident involving the 
missionarys car on the fourth of july 
were not 100 percent sure all the homicides are related 
said capt steve binegar of the marion county sheriffs department 
the lead investigator 
the main thing that links them together are the profiles of 
the victims they are all similar he said serial killers are 
certainly a possibility we cant discount 
robbery appears to be part of the motive but some of the 
bodies were nude leading to all kinds of conjecture binegar 
said ill say this it doesnt appear that they the killer or 
killers would be able to support themselves with the money 
stolen 
if the killings are related and the killers are women the 
criminals would be highly unusual sociologists and psychologists 
say female serial killers are extremely rare 
women who kill usually do so with people they know said 
richard hollinger a university of florida sociology professor 
reconstructed police renderings of the suspects show an 
ovalfaced stringyhaired blonde and a chubby roundfaced 
darkcomplexioned woman wearing a baseballtype cap 
the women were seen leaving an accident scene july 4 on a county 
road near orange springs 35 miles east of gainesville not far 
from interstate 75 their car evidently missed a curve ran through 
a fence and tore down a gate 
the women abandoned the car it later was traced to the missing 
missionary peter siems 65 of jupiter 
witnesses described the blonde woman as about 5foot8 25 to 30 
years old wearing blue jeans and a white tshirt with a tattoo on 
her right arm possibly in the shape of a heart the other woman 
was described as about 5foot4 weighing 175 to 200 pounds and 
wearing a cap or a hat 
a pattern in the killings emerged slowly because the victims 
bodies were discovered in widely scattered areas 
the first victim found was richard mallory who owned an 
electronics repair shop in clearwater his body was found under a 
scrap of carpet near interstate 95 north of daytona beach 
three victims were found near ocala in marion county another in 
neighboring citrus county in northern central florida 
another victim was found in june in pasco county about 20 miles 
north of tampa another was discovered in may in adel ga along 
interstate 75 about 40 miles north of the florida line 
the latest victim added to the list of possibly connected 
slayings is gino antonio 60 of cocoa hunters found his body last 
month in the dixie county woods near cross city about 120 miles 
north of st petersburg he was nude except for socks 
also a car belonging to a missing kennedy space center engineer 
was found in a shopping center near orlando international airport 
in september 
binegar said no formal investigative team has been formed but 
his office is coordinating information gathered from other police 
agencies and sending it to the fbi

prices were down slightly on the tokyo stock 
exchange today while yearend demand for dollars pushed the united

percent to settle at 2434950 points by the 3 pm 1 am est 
close estimated volume on the first section was heavy with 800 
million shares trading hands 
todays fall combined a rush of yearend transactions with 
unwinding selling from arbitrage trading after the surges of

kokusai securities

issued by the tokyo stock exchange this morning for futures and

triggers profittaking on long positions said darrel whitten an 
analyst at prudential bache securities 
the bank of japan has not yet seen enough of a slowdown in the 
economy to bring interest rates down considerably and is still 
fighting the inflationary effects of high oil prices and the labor 
shortage he said 
high interest rates probably will continue to firm the yen 
against the dollar until the end of the year and interest rates 
will continue to lead stock market action he said

the dollar settled at 13187 yen up 57 yen from thursdays 
close the currency opened at 13209 yen and trading ranged 
between 13182 yen and 13215 yen 
trading by companies that are closing their books or have a 
special need of dollars such as oil companies facing highpriced 
oil supplies is helping keep the dollar above 130 yen despite 
falling interest rates and continued weakness in the united states

harder time landing a job in 1991 than their counterparts did this 
year according to an annual survey of the nations businesses 
but engineers will be in demand and people with masters 
degrees will be hired at a 25 percent higher rate than 1990 
according to the 45th annual lindquistendicott report released 
thursday 
the report found that businesses plan to hire 1 percent fewer 
graduates overall because of concerns over the recession 
inflation the federal budget deficit and the persian gulf crisis 
the report also found that a job applicants lack of knowledge 
about the company is the biggest turnoff for recruiters 
the market is going to be more competitive the students are 
going to have to work harder and be more creative and imaginative 
but the jobs are going to be there theyre just going to be more 
difficult to uncover said victor r lindquist director of 
placement at northwestern university 
accountants teachers and health care professionals will be in 
great demand in a few years lindquist said at a news conference 
the highest average starting salary 43200 will go to job

44 percent the same as last years increase but below the yearly 
inflation rate the report said

covering a wide range of industries expect business to stay the 
same or decline he said 39 percent believe business will improve 
also nearly onethird of the companies did worse in 1990 than in 
1989 he indicated 
some grads will be working in jobs with less status salary or 
prestige but ive always found that its still better to be in the 
ballpark than out in left field lindquist said

the general assembly has urged member 
nations to halt all aid to israel over its occupation of arab 
territories and called anew for a peace conference on the 
palestinian issue 
the united states voted against the measures thursday night 
after its representative jack stein complained to the assembly that 
such divisive language does not promote the cause of peace 
the assembly adopted the measures by wide margins 
the united states has been struggling to remove language 
endorsing a mideast peace conference from a draft resolution of the 
more influential un security council fearing it would look like 
a concession to iraq 
israel a traditional us ally vehemently opposes any such 
conference a us veto of the proposal could jeopardize the 
tenuous arab coalition the united states has aligned against iraq 
which has championed the palestinian call for a homeland since it 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
a security council vote on the resolution has been put off six 
times in a week another one is tentatively planned for monday 
cuban ambassador ricardo alarcon in rallying the assembly to 
endorse a peace conference declared there is a need for a 
comprehensive peace in the middle east based on the withdrawal of 
israeli from the occupied territories 
the resolution endorsing a peace conference was adopted 99 to 19 
with 32 abstentions israel the united states and several european 
nations were among those voting against it 
the resolution also condemned israels aggression against 
the palestinians and declared that us military and economic aid 
has encouraged israel to pursue its aggressive and expansionist 
policies in the occupied lands 
it also declared that strategic usisraeli cooperation has 
had adverse effects on efforts for the establishment of a 
comprehensive just and lasting peace in the middle east 
stein protested that the united states remains firmly 
supportive of efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace but added 
that the shape of a final settlement cannot be dictated by any 
party in advance 
the general assembly adopted another resolution condemning 
israeli occupation and called on member states to put an end to 
the flow to israel of any military economic financial and 
technological aid 
stein said a call to halt aid to israel was unacceptable and 
objected to the critical reference to the united states in the 
clause on usisraeli cooperation 
the assembly also passed resolutions declaring israeli 
administration of jerusalem illegal and calling for greater 
cooperation between the united nations and the arab league 
israel seized the gaza strip from egypt and the west bank 
including east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 middle east war

a mysterious former east german official whose 
alleged gun running and other business deals kept the communist 
government supplied with western cash is the central figure in a 
highlevel probe in newly unified germany 
alexander schalckgolodkowski the former east german boss of 
foreign trade fled to the west when the hardline regime collapsed 
a year ago his activities are now making headlines because of 
allegations that the new government gave him refuge 
various german news reports have described him as living in a 
bavarian villa or visiting a cia debriefing center in the united 
states schalck reportedly held the rank of lieutenant general in 
the east german secret police in addition to his foreign trade 
post before finding refuge in the west 
berlin prosecutors acting on tips from eastern investigators 
launched an investigation of schalck on suspicion of corruption and 
gun running but they are having difficulty finding any 
incriminating documents 
seventy police officers searched 15 locations around germany on 
monday for evidence that could link schalck to 162 million missing 
from east german coffers 
authorities said they failed to uncover information about 
foreign bank accounts rumored to have been set up by schalck in 
switzerland 
as chief of east germanys foreign trade schalck supervised 
sales of export goods that produced western revenues sorely needed 
by the communist government 
he is suspected of using a household goods factory near rostock 
as a cover for exporting weapons to countries in south america 
africa and the middle east 
another allegation is that schalck helped former east german 
economic czar guenther mittag finance a new house with money 
generated from government business 
schalcks current whereabouts are unclear 
lutz stavenhagen the bonn chancellery official in charge of 
german intelligence told a news conference wednesday that federal 
intelligence agents had questioned schalck several times this year 
however stavenhagen denied schalck is living under protection 
of the intelligence agency and added i dont know where he is 
citing unidentified sources stern magazine said schalck went to 
the united states with bonns knowledge to provide information to 
the central intelligence agency 
but schalcks lawyer peter danckert said in a television 
interview wednesday that his client was at a villa in bavaria 
danckert also rejected allegations of wrongdoing against his 
client 
the collapse of east germany and its merger with west germany on 
oct 3 did nothing to allay suspicions that schalck retained 
control of a corrupt financial empire 
there is also speculation that he was able to exploit his ties 
to officials in bonn for his own benefit 
stern this week described a socalled bonn connection that 
allegedly arranged for schalck to evade east german criminal 
charges during last years political revolution 
stern said west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble 
intervened when east german criminal police were closing in on 
schalck last december schaeuble denied the magazines allegations 
as the east german governments envoy for business dealings with 
the west schalck met many of the top political players in bonn 
he disappeared while on an official visit to west germany on 
dec 2 1989 four days later he surfced in west berlin where he 
turned himself over to police 
schalck remained in a west berlin jail for one month until west 
german police set him free denying an east german extradition 
request on the grounds he could not get a fair trial there 
while other leading party officials sweated out the revolution 
in jail or under house arrest schalck soon found himself living in 
a villa on a lake near munich 
schalcks phone number is unlisted and he has not spoken to 
news reporters since the case began dominating german news reports 
a few weeks ago 
after the downfall of east germanys hardline leaders in autumn 
1989 reformist communists targeted schalck and other former top 
officials for corruption charges 
the allegations were applauded by east germans who were shocked 
by revelations about the handsome homes used by senior communist 
party officials 
schalck was always listed among these officials

the governments human rights commission says 
the top antidrug agency has been the target of scores of 
complaints and the panel is recommending firing and prosecuting 
agents accused of involvement in rights abuses 
my government does not hide abuses president carlos salinas 
de gortari told reporters as he accepted the 400page report 
thursday from his national human rights commission 
he vowed to to continue fighting crime eradicating official 
impunity and putting all efforts toward the most strict respect for 
human rights 
the president noted that his government has banned prosecutions 
based on confessions a step taken due to complaints that police 
routinely torture defendants into making false confessions 
commission president jorge carpizo said his agency had dealt 
with 1343 complaints ranging from murder and torture to unjust 
loss of housing he said it has finished 397 cases since salinas 
had inaugurated it on june 6 
the report said the federal attorney generals office and the 
judicial police under its control were accused of 171 cases of 
rights violations nearly three times as many as those filed 
against any other agency 
ten of the 33 recommendations for action issued by the 
commission also were directed against the federal police no other 
agency received more than one 
many of the recommendations urged firing and prosecuting agents 
accused of involvement in human rights abuses 
the federal judicial police are mexicos main narcoticsfighting 
agency and the primary partner of us drug enforcement agents 
attempting to block the international flow of drugs 
salinas vowed that his fight against drug traffic has been 
unconditional and definitive we will not permit this threat to 
remain against the society nor against the state 
but at the same time neither will we tolerate it becoming a 
pretext for injuring the rights none of them of people 
on sunday the president ordered the attorney generals office 
to release an opposition party mayor who had been jailed since may 
on what the rights commission termed false drug charges 
the president had also vowed to prosecute eight federal drug 
agents accused of involvement in the shooting deaths of six people 
earlier this month 
other leading targets of complaints were the prosecutors 
offices in the capital and states as well as the federal prison 
service 
the report said illegal arrest was the most common complaint 
followed by torture homicide abuse of authority threats 
injuries and false accusation 
from the reports it can be deduced that mexico has problems 
in the complete observance of human rights which it could not hide 
if it wanted to carpizo said 
but he added that if the problems are recognized it is 
because there is political will to resolve them and they are going 
to be resolved not to do it would be suicide

the parents of a woman who has been 
comatose for seven years awaited a ruling today on whether the 
feeding tube keeping her alive should be removed 
nancy cruzans father joe said late thursday he planned to be 
with his daughter when probate judge charles e teel jr announced 
his decision this afternoon 
you know its strange i dont feel very emotional he 
said i just kind of feel burned out 
ms cruzan 33 has been in a coma since suffering severe brain 
damage in a 1983 traffic accident 
doctors have said her condition is irreversible and her parents 
have argued since 1987 that she should be allowed to die 
the us supreme court ruled last june that ms cruzan could be 
permitted to die but only if clear and convincing evidence 
proved that would be what she wanted 
several of ms cruzans former coworkers since have testified 
that she told them she wouldnt want to be kept alive in a 
vegetative state 
he and his wife joyce have said if the judge rejects their 
request to remove their daughters feeding tube they will ask him 
to let them move her to another state where it would be allowed 
cruzan said thursday that if the judge ruled in their favor he 
wasnt sure how soon he would ask workers at the missouri 
rehabilitation center to remove the tube 
state health officials have promised to abide by todays 
decision workers at the rehabilitation center had been preparing 
themselves emotionally for a decision in favor of removing the 
tube said center spokeswoman barbara shoun 
i would say months of soul searching on the part of the staff 
are coming to a head at this time she said 
teel ruled in favor of disconnecting the tube in 1988 but his 
decision was overturned by the missouri supreme court after the 
us supreme courts decision the case was returned to teels 
court to determine if ms cruzan really would want to be allowed to 
die 
the woman has been in a vegetative state since the jan 11 
1983 accident and lies in a bed her body stiff and her hands 
bent like claws 
she also suffers from seizures vomiting bleeding gums and 
contorted limbs doctors have said if she keeps receiving 
nourishment she could continue in that condition for another 40 
years 
if her feeding tube is disconnected she would probably die in 
about two weeks said dr ronald cranford a minneapolis 
neurologist who has examined her 
it will be a peaceful death he said

at montgomery county sheriff louis e barber who investigated the 
1978 rapeslaying of ida mae moses 21 when she was nearly nine 
months pregnant

times in the head on oct 3 1978 he also received death sentences 
for murdering rosemary jackson 32 in gwinnett county ga and 
stephanie hawkins 21 in tampa fla later that month 
justus was the 11th person to die in the electric chair since 
virginia resumed executions in 1982 he was the 143rd person to be 
executed nationwide since the us supreme court allowed states to 
revive the death penalty in 1976 
gov l douglas wilder rejected justus request for clemency a 
few hours before the execution justus lawyer john c copacino 
had argued that the inmate suffered from brain damage he also said 
justus was abused as a child 
earlier thursday justus apologized to his victims families and 
urged that the death penalty be abolished

souvenir hawkers are doing a lucrative 
business outside the courthouse of this remote amazon jungle 
outpost where ranchers are on trial in the slaying of ecologist 
chico mendes 
a mere 600 fetches a 20inchby28 inch oil painting of the 
chubby rain forest defender staring stern as gen douglas 
macarthur as the acre river meanders through the jungle into the 
sunset 
short on cash no problem artist jorge rivasplata who came all 
the way from lima peru to sell the gem can cut a deal 500 
without the wood frame 
of course im really here in support of chico mendes he 
said but why not make some money while im at it 
so goes the philosophy of many merchants in this sleepy amazon 
town cash in for as long as brazils most important trial of the 
decade lasts 
the trials objective is to decide who is responsible for the 
murder of mendes on the night of dec 22 1988 
but some residents and traveling salesmen have other objectives 
mainly making quick bucks off the hundreds of ecologists 
politicians journalists and officials that have flocked to this 
town to see the trial 
anything is fair game for the face of the slain rain forest 
defender and rubber tapper he appears on buttons lags ashtrays 
can openers tshirts caps and wooden cups there are even chico 
mendes christmas cards going for 3 apiece 
how much cried ilzamar mendes widow of the slain ecologist 
and head of the chico mendes foundation i wouldnt even buy one 
at that price 
not many of the rubber tappers that live in this river town can 
the exploitation proves irritating to some especially for those 
like luiz vieira de souza a 63yearold tapper who traveled eight 
hours in a dugout canoe eating solely manioc root to get to xapuri 
this is crazy bristled the leatheryskinned tapper as he 
refused a bottle of mineral water selling for 1 i may have to 
leave early if my money runs out 
some profiteers are imaginative one barrelshaped elderly woman

down the dusty brick and cobblestone street zamir jose teixeira 
was loading a fourfoothigh chestnut tree into an oxdrawn cart 
the buyer was counting a wad of bills under a banner that said 
progress in the jungle 
had teixeira legally cut the trees no one knew and teixeira 
wasnt telling 
forest produce was a bit more reasonable if the buyer comparison 
shopped a 2ounce box of powdered guarana a tart amazon fruit 
used in its powdered form as a stimulant was selling for the 
equivalent of 5 
a plate of white rice red beans lettuce tomatoes and heavily 
salted beef seemed reasonable at 4

the foreman of a jury that convicted a 
paroled child killer of slaying 10 women during a 22month murder 
spree said jurors decided the man wasnt insane 
the monroe county court jury convicted arthur j shawcross on 
thursday of 10 counts of seconddegree murder in the deaths of 
eight prostitutes and two other women between march 1988 and 
january 1990 he faces up to 25 years in prison on each count when 
he is sentenced feb 1 
jury foreman robert edwards said the panel was particularly 
skeptical of the testimony of dr dorothy lewis a psychiatrist who 
testified that shawcross suffered brain damage and posttraumatic 
stress disorder brought on by child sexual abuse and his 
experiences during the vietnam war 
if she kept her feet on the floor instead of in her mouth 
shed have been all right edwards said 
he said jurors never believed defense allegations that shawcross 
was legally insane when he killed the women or even that he was 
emotionally disturbed which would have required they convict him 
of the lesser charge of manslaughter 
we didnt buy it he said 
shawcross who confessed to the killings was arrested jan 4 a 
day after state police spotted him lingering near the body of one 
of his victims 
relatives of the victims embraced and cried as the verdicts were 
announced afterward they thanked prosecutor charles siragusa 
hopefully arthur shawcross will never see the light of day 
again siragusa said 
defense lawyer thomas cocuzzi said he would appeal 
at the time of the murders shawcross was on parole after 
serving 15 years in prison for the 1972 stranglings of an 
8yearold girl and 10yearold boy 
he faces trial next year for the killing of an 11th woman 
shawcross did not testify during the trial but jurors watched 
videotapes of him being interviewed under hypnosis by lewis he 
appeared to reenact episodes of abuse and to take on the 
personalities of his mother his sister and a cannibal from 
medieval england 
prosecution psychiatrist dr park dietz argued that shawcross 
was faking mental illness to avoid being sent to prison

walt disney co and the family of the late 
jim henson creator of the muppets broke off talks after failing 
to reach agreement in disneys 18month bid to acquire henson 
associates inc 
disney also had sought an exclusive production agreement in the 
deal valued at 100 million to 150 million 
we truly regret we could not come to terms disney chairman 
michael d eisner said thursday 
erwin okun a disney co vice president said it was too early 
to tell whether the failed acquisition would preclude the two 
companies from attempting future joint productions he noted that 
statements issued by both companies were cordial 
the henson family which has owned henson associates since the 
puppeteers death in may said current projects with disney would 
not be affected by the termination of talks 
those projects include a disney channel television series jim 
hensons mother goose a television sitcom involving dinosaurs 
to be aired in january on abc and a 3d film visitors would see at 
walt disney world in florida 
we would have liked to see this deal succeed the henson 
family said in a statement unfortunately after 18 months of 
negotiating the companies could not reach a mutually satisfactory 
agreement 
henson the genius behind such characters as kermit the frog and 
miss piggy founded his production company in 1958 as muppets inc 
to produce all his properties 
recent negotiations had centered around the lower price disney 
offered after henson died of pneumonia may 18 
industry analysts at first speculated that hensons death 
lessened the value of the acquisition hensons personal talents 
formed part of eisners original strategy to crossmarket muppet 
characters with disney creations 
jeffrey logsdon an analyst with crowell weedon amp co said it 
was more likely that disney was scared off by hefty estate taxes 
owed on henson properties

shoppers asked what they would like to see in 
moscows food stores have simple tastes meat butter and milk 
basic food canned goods sausage meat products said 
viktor rozhkov a muscovite who was buying bread thursday evening 
with his wife nowadays we have practically nothing 
raisa l lebedinskaya another shopper also said she would like 
to see the elementary things in the stores such as milk and 
butter i want to see all those things that were freely available 
in the shops a year ago mrs lebedinskaya said 
the soviet government says deliveries of most food products are 
running 15 percent to 44 percent below 1989 levels mostly due to 
pilfering and profiteering 
to combat this officials said thursday the red army has been 
enlisted to help unload thousands of tons of governmentpurchased 
food that are stuck at ports and railway stations 
more than 16 million metric tons of imported goods await 
unloading or shipment from soviet ports and about 7000 railways 
cars are waiting at border stations 
the soldiers also will help ease the backlog of foreign food aid 
that is flooding into the soviet union 
shoppers interviewed thursday evening said they were confident 
that the kgb secret police interior ministry troops and other law 
officers would ensure that the foreign food aid gets to soviet 
stores 
they also welcomed news that the bush administration promised 
the soviet union up to 1 billion in loan guarantees to buy us 
wheat corn and other farm products to help out during the coming 
hard winter the shoppers did not think such aid was humiliating 
for the soviet union to accept because it was not a handout 
if it was simply free of charge it would be humiliating 
said rozhkov 55 but as its credit its not humiliating 
vasily i tarasov hurrying along the street carrying a plastic 
shopping bag in each hand also welcomed the help from the united 
states and likened it to american assistance during world war ii 
we fought together against the fascists and if they help us 
again we favor it said tarasov 75 
under orders from president mikhail s gorbachev the kgb has 
set up a special unit to combat economic sabotage including taking 
control of distributing the foreign food aid and preventing its 
theft 
deputy prime minister lev voronin who heads a government 
commissioin overseeing the aid distribution and kgb maj gen 
alexander n karbainov stressed at separate news briefings thursday 
that the majority of foreign humanitarian aid was reaching its 
destination 
both admitted however that some has fallen into the hands of 
black marketeers who can sell it to speculators taking advantage of 
widespread shortages in staterun stores 
there are some disorders voronin said the harshest 
measures have been taken to eliminate all such phenomena he did 
not elaborate 
voronin said the army had been enlisted to unload cargo planes 
and 1000 soldiers were ordered to brest on the polish border to 
help clear the rail backlog 
he said 1000 trucks were found to help distribute aid arriving 
at moscow railway stations after pravda quoted the railways 
ministry as saying the situation was catastrophic voronin 
predicted it would be under control by dec 20 
as of wednesday night the soviet union had received 1700 
metric tons of food aid and 800 tons of medicines cribs and 
construction materials voronin said 
he said the single largest donor country was germany which gave 
1900 metric tons followed by italy at 117 metric tons the united 
states at 93 metric tons austria at 75 metric tons and 
switzerland and the netherlands at 45 metric tons each 
first priority for receiving aid goes to schools and orphanages 
followed by ecologically damaged areas like chernobyl and the aral 
sea next come pensioners the disabled and low income families

failed brakes may have caused an amtrak train to 
derail and smash into a commuter train injuring 264 people 
federal safety officials said 
they also said thursday that the amtrak train may have been 
traveling too fast along a curve where the crash occurred but that 
the speed may never be determined because one speed recorder on the 
train was not working and the other was destroyed in the crash 
an apprentice engineer operating the amtrak train told 
investigators he tried to brake three times as the night owl from 
washington approached a boston station said susan coughlin vice 
chairwoman of the national transportation safety board 
he indicated that in his three attempts to brake the train 
the brakes failed to set up properly to stop it coughlin said at 
a news conference 
the apprentice richard abramson also told authorities that 
senior engineer willis copeland tried to stop the night owl using 
emergency brakes she said 
coughlin said brakes on amtrak cars that did not derail were 
working normally brakes from the derailed cars were sent to 
washington for testing 
the rushhour crash wednesday morning near the back bay station 
injured 264 people copeland 53 of bethany conn and abramson 
41 of trumbull conn were among 11 of those thursday still 
hospitalized 
coughlin said that one of the night owls speed recorders was 
destroyed in the crash and the other for unknown reasons did not 
record during the last five miles 
we will never know the exact speed of impact i regret the 
fact that we dont have that data she said the last time he 
abramson looked at the speedometer he was going between 60 and 
70 mph she said 
coughlin said data from signals tripped by the train showed it 
traveled the last 1 miles in 49 seconds at an average speed of 
918 mph before that last stretch the train could travel safely 
at 100 mph but it should have slowed down to 30 mph by the time it 
reached the point where it derailed on a curve 500 feet from the 
station she said 
it was the first time copeland had taken over operation of a 
regular train run authorities said 
the herald and the boston globe said drug and alcohol tests on 
copeland were negative the results of those on abramson were 
awaited 
the force of the crash bent the massachusetts bay transportation 
authoritys 120ton locomotive around a concrete barrier in an 
lshape three amtrak cars including the locomotive that carried 
the two amtrak engineers became a mesh of broken metal parts 
barely distinguishable as separate units 
thomas glynn mbta general manager said the accident caused 
31 million in damage to mbta equipment and extensive damage 
to amtrak equipment 
the herald reported today that copeland was fired from conrail 
after a derailment in the late 1970s but was later rehired more 
recently the paper said he agreed to a lifetime ban from 
metronorth railroad the commuter railroad that serves new yorks 
northern suburbs following signal violations in 1988 and last 
year 
he also was at the controls of an amtrak train involved in a 
july 1984 crash that was blamed on a signal problem the national 
transportation safety board cleared him of wrongdoing 
john p cole a washington lawyer representing crash victims 
said he planned to file a 475 million class action suit in us 
district court in washington against amtrak because of the 
accident

seven vietnamese boat people suffered burns 
today after wrapping themselves in blankets and setting themselves 
on fire to protest the governments refusal to settle them in the 
west authorities said 
two members of the group were hospitalized with severe burns in 
guarded and fair condition respectively the others were briefly 
treated at hospitals 
the protesters at the whitehead detention center had been 
refused refugee status and thus the chance to settle in the west 
they had been on a hunger strike for four days 
the act was an attempt at mass suicide said raymond hall a 
spokesman for the office of the un high commissioner for refugees 
in geneva 
the whitehead detention center is the largest of hong kongs 15 
refugee camps it houses 22800 boat people 
raymond lai the assistant commissioner of correctional 
services said the government regretted the boat people should 
have resorted to such actions that might harm themselves 
the british colonial government instituted a screening process 
in june 1988 to separate what it called genuine refugees who have 
a right to be resettled in the west from economic migrants 
who will be sent back to vietnam 
of the 45000 boat people now in hong kongs detention centers 
17 percent are genuine refugees the rest will have to go home the 
government says 
so far plans to return the vietnamese have not been too 
successful 
britain backed down after intense international criticism 
followed hong kongs forced repatriation of 51 boat people last 
december 
under a voluntary repatriation program more than 6000 
vietnamese have been flown home since march 1989 but about 40000 
boat people have arrived since then 
another program was started dec 1 to return vietnamese who do 
not strongly oppose repatriation although they did not volunteer 
for it only 23 people have returned home under that program 
a group of university of hong kong lawyers recently issued a 
report that obtaining refugee status was a matter of luck they 
said hong kong officials didnt know enough about vietnam to be 
informed interviewers and furthermore were prejudiced against 
vietnamese 
hong kong claims the screening process has been improved and 
un officials agree 
nine vietnamese denied refugee status are currently challenging 
the screening process in court if the court rules in their favor 
some lawyers believe it could upset the screening process forcing 
the government to rescreen tens of thousands of cases

a flight surgeon who has been denied conscientious 
objector status is hoping his 2weekold hunger strike will get him 
out of the army before he is due to be deployed to saudi arabia 
next week 
capt david wiggins says he has lost 17 of the 167 pounds he 
carried on his 5foot10inch frame before he began subsisting on 
vitamins and water nov 30 
wiggins 28 said thursday that he expects to be deployed from 
fort hood to the persian gulf on monday 
i havent heard anything to change that belief from the 
army he said my bags are packed im just waiting for a 
phone call i guess 
he says he is philosophically opposed to war and has been trying 
to get out of the army since february 
he began the fast after a federal judge refused to overturn the 
armys ruling that he could not be discharged as a conscientious 
objector he said he is not a coward and doesnt want out of the 
army to avoid being sent to the persian gulf 
my purpose is to be discharged from the army because 
contributing to an organization whose sole purpose is killing is 
reprehensible to me he said 
wiggins said he first began to have doubts about the military 
while still a cadet at west point he said the feelings became 
stronger after communist governments were toppled across eastern 
europe by peaceful means last year 
war is not a necessary evil because nonviolent political 
change is possible he said 
he said he has offered to pay the government back for his 
education at new york medical college if he is released from 
service 
he estimated he can go without food for about two more weeks 
before he becomes unable to work 
i can only assume army officials are content to let me 
starve to the point i am hospitalized he said

twelve people have died in a religious 
ritual apparently after drinking a poisoned sacrament and the 
leader of the ceremony clung to life in a coma today officials 
said 
authorities who went to the house thursday night in the 
impoverished el florido neighborhood of this border city found 
twelve bodies strewn about the living room with five survivors 
another ritual participant later checked into a hospital 
the dead included four men seven women and a 6yearold girl 
police said 
the victims faces were contorted in pain and had suffered a 
purplish discoloration of the skin apparently caused by poisoning 
the judicial police report said autopsy reports were expected 
later today 
authorities in this city south of san diego speculated the 
deaths were caused by an industrial alcohol perhaps rubbing 
alcohol that was poured accidentally into a fruit punch the 
participants shared during a religious ceremony 
we believe weve ruled out both suicide and homicide said 
jose nunez de caceres a commander of the baja california state 
police 
officers were conducting tests on the punch and a bowl of cooked 
chicken found in the house where the 12 bodies were found said 
baja california police spokeswoman sara yolanda gonzalez 
the group leader and owner of the home federico padres mejia 
62 was in a coma hospital officials said 
also hospitalized were ana osuna aged four months consuelo 
ponce 35 juan jose sarabia 49 moises merida gonzalez 32 and 
hernandez hospital officials did not describe their conditions 
relatives of the victims said they had previously attended 
healing rites in the house that were a mixture of christianity and 
spiritualism calling the spirits of the dead for consultation 
in a hospital interview survivor alfredo osuna hernandez said 
the people gathered round a cardboard virgin mary and drank the 
punch as a sacrament several hours later people began falling 
ill hernandez said 
people started complaining of stomach pains and some of them 
began to vomit some of them started to get scared and they started 
to scream from the pain hernandez said 
his sisterinlaw margarita ramos de osuna 25 was among the 
first to fall he told the associated press she was listed among 
the dead 
i didnt try to help her because the lord was there 
hernandez said 
asked why no one left to seek help he said 
it is very damaging to leave the circle 
hernandez said the gathering was a cleansing or purification 
ritual an unemployed auto body repairman he took part with hopes 
the ceremony would change his luck 
he wanted a little of the lords coin hernandez said i 
was looking for a key to a job a key to work 
a neighbor gerardo barrios said he did small construction jobs 
at the house and had been invited by padres to take part in one 
ceremony 
he said he had died twice and that his spirit left him and 
returned said barrios 
ritual participants sat in a circle within a rope and spread oil 
on their bodies which padres said would cleanse their souls 
barrios said 
he would talk about eternal sleep and tell us to go to 
sleep barrios said 
officers who saw the living room said a rope with 13 knots tied 
in it had been laid in a circle on the floor around four or five of 
the bodies 
a book of prayers dealing with the sith seal reportedly was 
also found apparently related to the biblical prophesies of 
armageddon 
neighbors said chanting had filtered from the house over the 
past several nights the last time starting wednesday night and 
continuing into the morning 
the house was located in a cluster of shanties typical of the 
grubby suburbs of tijuana mexicos fourthlargest city with about 
2 million people 
authorities found the bodies sprawled in contorted poses on 
couches chairs and the floor of the home 
ana faviola miranda 17 the daughter of a woman who died in the 
tragedy discovered the bodies and reported them to police said 
ms gonzalez the police spokeswoman 
miranda 17 said she went to the house at 8 pm wednesday and 
padres told her to leave and come back later according to police 
after spending the night outside in a car miranda asked a 
neighbor for help and the two entered the house through a window 
miranda at first thought healing ceremony participants were asleep 
or in a trance police said

would have saved dover police 1 million says the lawyer for a man 
police mistook for a jewel thief 
kenneth duval 50 of lawrence mass won a 1 million federal 
lawsuit monday against the police department duval had argued that 
police violated his constitutional rights by arresting him in 1984 
and accusing him of belonging to an east coast diamond theft gang 
it was not a money case for kenneth duval said his lawyer 
andrew isaac if they had called him back in 1985 and said they 
were sorry and tried to cover his expenses and said thank you for 
trying to help us it would have ended there 
police alleged that duval helped steal a diamond from a 
department store they charged him with being an accomplice to 
theft and also accused him of belonging to a gang that stole 
diamonds in new england new jersey pennsylvania and new york 
strafford county attorney lincoln soldati dropped the charges a 
year later admitting police had the wrong man soldati had the 
grace and common sense to write mr duval and tell him it was an 
unfortunate case of mistaken identity isaac said 
duvals defense cost him 33000 his lawyer said 
isaac said dover police originally investigated another man but 
that man led them to duval 
he was a recent russian immigrant they showed him a picture 
and the man said it looks like a guy who lives where i used to 
live it looks like ken isaac said ken like most 
people talked to police for two hours he showed them his business 
diary and appointments 
dover police are considering appealing the award

the president of the african 
national congress today said the black opposition group should 
reconsider its support for international sanctions imposed on south 
africa to protest apartheid 
oliver tambo who a day earlier returned to south africa after 
30 years in exile told the opening session of the ancs 
consultative conference the group had to reconsider its strategy to 
recognize the changing political situation in south africa 
it is no longer enough for us to repeat the tried slogans 
he said in a speech that could mark a major change in the ancs 
position on sanctions it was the first conference of the formerly 
banned anc in south africa in more than 30 years 
we should therefore carefully reevaluate the advisability of 
insisting on the retention of sanctions given the new developments 
in the country and abroad the 73yearold leader said 
if the anc sticks to outdated policies the whiteled government 
could gain the strategic initiative in talks on the future of south 
africa tambo said some anc leaders are concerned the governments 
push for reforms is upstaging the opposition 
but tambo also urged the cheering delegates to step up the 
struggle against apartheid and win the freedom of blacks 
whatever our tactics our absolute determination is to regain 
our freedom tambo said the struggle against apartheid should 
be intensified on all fronts 
the conference which began today with some 1600 delegates is 
considering anc policies and the course of talks with the 
government on sharing power with the black majority 
moderates who support the talks are expected to face tough 
opposition from radicals who doubt the governments willingness to 
give up power 
the anc has opposed government calls for an easing of sanctions 
anc deputy president nelson mandela said recently it was too soon 
to lift sanctions despite reforms by president fw de klerk 
many nations have imposed various bans on economic cultural and 
sporting ties with south africa to protest the apartheid system of 
government tambo did not say which sanctions might be eased 
de klerk has said lifting sanctions will help boost the economy 
and ease black unemployment homelessness and other problems 
tambo is to spend about three weeks in south africa before going 
to london for treatment for a stroke he suffered last year 
mandela in a speech after tambo charged that recent black 
factional fighting was part of an orchestrated campaign to destroy 
confidence in the anc he alleged some members of the government 
were trying to weaken the anc before talks on power sharing are 
held 
as it has unfolded and taken hold over the past three months 
it is evident that it is targeted at the anc he said 
the anc claims security force members are behind fighting that 
has claimed more than 1000 lives in the johannesburg area since 
august the fighting pits xhosas and other blacks who support the 
anc against zulus of the inkatha freedom party 
the government and the police have denied they are behind the 
violence which also has claimed more than 5000 lives in natal 
province in recent years 
de klerk unbanned the anc and other opposition groups feb 11 
and talks are expected to begin next year on power sharing de 
klerk has already begun dismantling parts of the apartheid system

the us ambassador to kuwait flew 
back to the united states today with about 50 american and other 
foreign hostages he led from iraq and the occupied emirate 
joining a us air force honor guard ambassador nathaniel 
howell saluted the members of his barebones embassy staff as they 
boarded a c5 military transport plane for the flight to andrews 
air force base outside washington 
aboard were 23 americans and 10 nonus citizen family members 
as well as 15 people going to canada officials said 
all had come from iraq or kuwait on thursday a us consulate 
spokesman craig springer said several americans evacuated 
thursday who were not aboard the c5 today have chosen to return 
home independently 
looking surprisingly fit after months of surviving on canned 
tuna howell told reporters before departing frankfurt that he 
slept well at an airport hotel got a haircut and feasted on 
sausage bacon and eggs for breakfast 
we have a lot of cholesterol to make up for he joked a 
reference to the nearly fourmonth ordeal at the besieged us 
embassy in kuwait following iraqs invasion of the emirate aug 2 
iraqs government of president saddam hussein ordered all 
foreign missions in kuwait to close aug 24 and those that defied 
the order had services cut off by authorities who took over the 
emirate after the aug 2 invasion 
barbara bodine the deputy chief of mission at the us embassy 
in kuwait said after checking into the hotel first i took a 
shower then i took a bath then i had dinner then i had another 
bubble bath 
howell and his staff left iraq on thursday on the last us 
charter to evacuate westerners who had been held by saddam to deter 
a us attack 
hundreds of westerners have left since saddam announced a 
blanket release of hostages on dec 6 and us officials said all 
other americans who wish to leave can take commercial 
transportation 
former hostages who would talk to reporters were very bitter 
about their experiences and accused iraq of a host of atrocities 
one american who said his mother was from indiana and his 
father from kuwait said several people who had been imprisoned 
after the invasion later told tales of torture 
he said he knew of one 15yearold boy who was arrested by iraqi 
authorities after protesting the shooting death of his younger 
brother the younger boy had been caught spraypainting antisaddam 
hussein graffitti and shot on the spot he said 
the young american who went to kuwait last summer to marry a 
kuwaiti woman said he planned to return to indiana and continue 
his studies at purdue university 
he declined to give his name for fear those he left behind would 
be harassed 
layla cox a kuwaiti married to an american was emotional as 
she walked away from the plane thursday carrying her baby daughter 
its terrible you had to be there she told reporters 
later as she waited with her husband wayne and three children 
to check into their room she explained that she couldnt join in 
the euphoria of the other hostages when the plane touched down in 
the west because of her three sisters left in kuwait 
my poor sisters and their kids are still hostages there i 
dont think ill be able to enjoy this freedom

a judge dismissed a murder charge 
against a doctor who invented a device that an alzheimers disease 
victim used to kill herself but he didnt clear the doctor to use 
the machine again 
district judge gerald mcnally on thursday threw out a 
firstdegree murder charge against dr jack kevorkian in the june 4 
death of janet adkins she died after activating a machine 
kevorkian invented that sent poison into her veins 
kevorkian was with her at the time of her death 
mcnally ruled at the end of a twoday preliminary hearing that 
michigan has no law against suicide or assisting in it 
michael modelski chief assistant oakland county prosecutor 
said the prosecutors office might ask the circuit court to 
reinstate the murder charge or bring lesser charges such as 
seconddegree murder or manslaughter against kevorkian 
i think everyone realizes this isnt the final step 
modelski said 
the ruling doesnt let kevorkian use the suicide device again 
it remains in police custody after prosecutors obtained a temporary 
court order preventing its further use a civil trial probably in 
january will decide whether or not to make that order permanent 
said kevorkians attorney geoffrey fieger 
once hooked up to the device mrs adkins 54 of portland 
ore pressed a button on the machine starting a flow of lethal 
chemical into her veins she died in the back of kevorkians van 
kevorkian said several motels and funeral homes had refused his 
request to let him use their sites for the suicide 
kevorkian notified authorities of the death and state police 
questioned him but he wasnt charged with murder until nearly six 
months later 
i was always convinced that i was doing the right thing but 
it was under terrible conditions and no one would want to repeat 
that kevorkian 62 a retired pathologist from royal oak said 
after mcnallys ruling 
he said the ruling bolstered his longtime support of what he 
calls physicianassisted suicide for the terminally ill 
we need a rational system to meet a crying need kevorkian 
said im going to work with the authorities and in the medical 
system weve got to reestablish the nobility of the profession 
in announcing his decision mcnally called on the legislature to 
address the issues raised by kevorkian a bill introduced by state 
sen fred dillingham would make assisting in a suicide a felony 
punishable by four years in prison and a 2000 fine 
the judge ruled after viewing a videotape of mrs adkins and 
kevorkian discussing her fight against alzheimers which causes 
loss of memory and irreversible brain degeneration the tape was 
made two days before her death 
my life before was wonderful she says i could play the 
piano and read i cant do any of those things now its too 
taxing 
why do you want your life to end kevorkian asks 
ive had enough mrs adkins answers her voice breaking 
mrs adkins husband ronald said from his home in portland 
that he was pleased with the judges ruling and had no regrets 
about his wifes decision 
i respected janets wishes she was a very intelligent woman 
and had it very well thought out he said its concept was 
something we had thought and talked about years before 
for his part kevorkian said after the hearing that he didnt 
expect to assist in other suicides on his own but wanted to enlist 
the medical establishments cooperation 
im going to work with the authorities he said 
on the videotape with the adkinses kevorkian repeated his 
longstanding views favoring assisted suicide 
these tough decisions have got to be made and whos in better 
position to decide them than the physicians he tells the couple 
one of the hardest things theyre going to have to do is this 
no matter how distasteful it is 
derek humphrey head of the national hemlock society in eugene 
ore welcomed the ruling the organization advocates a persons 
right to choose death if facing a terminal illness 
but humphrey said we would wish to see euthanasia performed 
for the dying in a more dignified way in home or hospital by the 
doctor who is treating the patient and of course according to a 
clear law

us charities are taking in more money this year than last but 
the needs of the poor are also rising and in the nations 
economically depressed northeast the organizations report giving 
has fallen off drastically 
charities across the country report increased demand for food 
shelter and clothing problems they blame on layoffs economic 
woes and government cutbacks 
its looking real scary said vicky wheeler of the central 
vermont community action council she said the number of daily 
visitors to the councils food bank is up from 15 to 35 in the past 
six months while donations have held steady the council has cut 
the size of its food packages by a third to make supplies last 
if we run out of food and cant help them theres not really 
any other place to turn she said 
other charities in the heavily industrialized northeast say 
contributions are down by as much as 67 percent from a year ago and 
their budgets are stretched pitifully thin 
nationally donations to the salvation army and goodwill 
industries of america inc are running about 8 percent above last 
years levels according to the national headquarters of those 
organizations 
two new yorkbased groups that keep tabs on charities the 
american association of fundraising council and the national 
charities information bureau also said the 1990 philanthropy 
tally is unlikely to fall below 1989s 115 billion 
giving for 1990 is expected to be up as it has been every 
year since 1955 said charities information bureau president ken 
albrecht 
but the united way of america which projects a 45 percent gain 
in contributions to local united way campaigns said collection 
levels fluctuate widely from region to region 
if you want to talk about new england were down there a 
couple percentage points if you want to talk about the pacific 
northwest seattle is up in the double digits said richard 
fusco united way vice president for resource development 
of 80 local organizations contacted by the associated press 54 
said donations were flat or below yearago levels and 49 reported 
increased demand for their services 
fourteen said they stepped up their efforts this year because 
they expected hard times and 12 said they either had cut budgets 
and staff or were considering doing so 
we are two months behind on our 3800amonth rent one month 
behind on utilities said kent beittel executive director of the 
open shelter in columbus ohio a homelessaid center considering 
layoffs 
many charities in the economically depressed northeast report 
large dropoffs in giving 
the american red cross chapter in bridgeport conn had raised 
2300 toward a 30000 goal at the end of last week compared with 
7000 raised at the same time last year 
in boston donations to salvation army kettles are averaging 
about 50 percent of last year said chief bell ringer william 
edmonds meanwhile requests for assistance in massachusetts are up 
about 25 percent said charles williams director of salvation army 
social services in the state 
applications for salvation army assistance nationally are up 15 
percent from a year ago national spokesman leon ferraez said 
wednesday goodwill industries anticipates a 7 percent increase in 
requests for services said spokeswoman jeanne hamrick 
charities in the sunbelt states the west and some pockets of 
the midwest reported increased donations but most also said they 
had gone after funds more aggressively many california charities 
surveyed also said collections had increased or were holding 
steady but a few reported problems 
the salt lake city united way said giving was up 12 percent over 
last year the miami salvation army reported an increase and 
contributions were up at the united way of central iowa the easter 
seals society of iowa and the iowa march of dimes 
several charities complained of a drop in corporate 
contributions 
but corporate foundation and bequest donations together account 
for just 15 percent of us philanthropy said joanne hayes 
president of the american association of fundraising council 
the biggest donors are not upper middleclass people they are 
people of modest means she said

the special counsel for the senate 
committee investigating whether five senators improperly helped 
charles h keating is a partner in a law firm once tied to keating 
a report published today said 
the san francisco chronicle also said three of the senators 
lawyers work for firms with previous connections to the lincoln 
savings add loan association owner 
the chronicle said robert bennett special counsel for the 
senate ethics committee and two of the senators lawyers already 
were working on the panels investigation when they took jobs at 
firms with former keating links bennett today denounced the 
report 
keating was a major contributor to all five senators the ethics 
committee is considering whether the 13 million he and associates 
donated to their campaigns and related political causes was tied to 
their help in dealing with federal thrift regulators 
keatings parent company american continental co went 
bankrupt in april 1989 and lincoln savings was seized by 
regulators the cost to taxpayers to cover insured deposits is 
expected to top 2 billion and keating is under a state fraud 
indictment in california 
its the most prominent case in the nations burgeoning savings 
and loan scandal 
bennett and his staff of lawyers and investigators have worked 
on the keating case for the ethics committee since last fall they 
joined the washington office of the new yorkbased skadden arps 
firm on april 15 of this year the chronicle said 
in 1985 skadden arps received about 4 million in fees from a 
limited partnership in which lincoln invested 359 million an 
183 percent interest the fees were for work on the partnerships 
takeover of crown zellerbach according to the newspaper 
bennett called the news report just one more very clear effort 
to discredit me to distract from the issues in this case and its 
not going to work 
thomas c green lawyer for sen donald riegle dmich joined 
the washington firm of sidley and austin on june 11 that was 2 
months after the firm was added as a defendant in a 250 million 
lawsuit filed on behalf of 23000 people who bought now worthless 
american continental bonds the chronicle said 
another sidley and austin attorney margery waxman helped 
develop keatings strategy for dealing with politicians and top 
federal regulators 
john dowd attorney for sen john mccain rariz joined the 
law firm of akin gump and strauss in january shortly after mccain 
retained him for the ethics committee investigation keating 
employed the firm in 1986 and 1987 
another lawyer for the firm appears on keatings appointment 
logs for 1986 regarding efforts to get keating associate lee henkel 
appointed to the federal home loan bank board according to the 
chronicle the board was then the top sampl regulatory body 
the federal deposit insurance corporation has said that akin 
gump is not on its list for handling the governments side of sampl 
matters because the firm has clients whose interests conflict with 
the fdics 
henkels lawyer has been james hamilton also the attorney for 
sen dennis deconcini dariz in the ethics committee hearings 
a key part of bennetts case against deconcini is that the 
senator may have withheld a vote that could have defeated a 
controversial white house judicial appointment in exchange for the 
reagan administrations agreement to appoint henkel to the bank 
board 
the lawyers for the other two keating five senators alan 
cranston of california and john glenn of ohio both democrats are 
with firms that have no known past relationship with keating or his 
dealings the chronicle said 
it was unclear late thursday whether bennett had informed the 
committee of his new law firms past relations with keating the 
chronicle said 
tom mcmahon spokesman for committee chairman sen howell 
heflin dala said heflin had no comment bob stevenson 
spokesman for committee vice chairman sen warren rudman rnh 
said the committee was told that skadden arps had conducted a 
conflict investigation found no conflict 
new york university law professor stephen gillers a specialist 
in legal ethics said bennett could have legitimately determined 
that the scope of his responsibility to the ethics committee 
does not include investigation of the crown zellerbach takeover 
that keatings lincoln was involved in 
but yale law professor geoffrey hazard said i think it would 
have been wise for bennett to hold off the affiliation with his new 
firm just because it would foreclose public anxiety and public 
criticism 
michael waldman director of ralph naders public citizen 
congress said the senators lawyers ties to firms with former 
keating links showed not so much a conflict of interest as a 
unity of interest

he already is undergoing such treatment 
the district attorneys office declined to comment

cheerleading squad students were shocked when it was disclosed he 
was a male and the story was highly publicized

defense secretary dick cheney responding to 
democratic calls to give economic sanctions against iraq more time 
said today patience is not producing results 
those who would have us rely indefinitely on economic 
sanctions alone need to face the possibility that they will fail to 
achieve our aims cheney told the house armed services committee 
the testimony from the pentagon chief and gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff comes amid the urgings of 
several democrats for a goslow approach in the gulf rather than 
the immediate use of military force 
but cheney told the panel that if the economic attempts and 
diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis fail the united states must 
have the option of using force to oust iraq from the oilrich 
emirate of kuwait 
having a capacity for patience does not mean we must remain 
patient when patience is not producing results we must always have 
other options and that is what the new deployments and the recent 
united nations action are all about cheney said 
president bush has announced that secretary of state james a 
baker iii will travel to iraq to try to resolve the crisis but 
cheney said the united states has given iraq 15 separate dates 
and then turned all those down and said he can only come on the 
12th of january 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed service panel and 
a supporter of bushs policy opened the hearing stressing the need 
for cheney and powell to answer a key question 
we want to explore with our witnesses today whether weve 
created a useitorloseit force in the persian gulf that will 
prematurely bring us to the question of peace or war aspin said 
on thursday several former us military officials and defense 
experts said they believe military force not a year of economic 
sanctions is the only way to oust iraqi forces from kuwait 
if we wait for sanctions to succeed saddam knows were 
waiting and he will outlast us said retired army col trevor 
dupuy 
cheney and powell received a more receptive audience today than 
when they appeared before the senate armed services committee less 
than two weeks ago 
the senate panels chairman sen sam nunn dga has been an 
outspoken critic of president bushs decision to deploy an 
additional 200000 troops to the persian gulf region nunn also 
believes the administration should give the united nations 
sanctions time to work before opting for war 
aspin has doubts about the sanctions he has endorsed bushs 
added deployment of forces and looks more favorably on using the 
military to neutralize saddam husseins troops 
in hearings before the house panel wednesday and thursday 
witnesses selected by aspin bolstered his and the bush 
administrations perspective on solving the crisis 
the witnesses endorsed using an air offensive against iraqi 
forces and then possibly opting for a ground attack however they 
warned the united states will have to pay a price for war 
we may have to take those first few rounds in the teeth in 
order to be able to have ultimate victory in the air said 
retired air force gen charles donnelly jr former commander of 
the us air forces in europe 
dupuy estimated that an air and ground attack would result in 
about 9000 casualties including 1000 to 1500 american dead 
the witnesses said the first target should be the iraqi command 
and if possible in the early days of an attack the countrys 
potential nuclear capability 
the lone note of dissent came from rep nicholas mavroules 
dmass who questioned whether arab allies would help in the 
effort to defeat iraq 
whos going to fight this war does anyone truly believe that 
a saudi or arab pilot will bomb iraq mavroules asked the 
witnesses its going to be a us war were going to lose 
thousands of men and women 
to shore up its offensive air capability the air force said 
thursday it is sending an undisclosed number of f16 fighter jets 
and a10 antiarmor aircraft to saudi arabia from germany and 
britain 
officials have declined to provide details on numbers of planes 
and aviators being sent but it is believed that at least 300 
additional air force planes are headed to the gulf along with at 
least 10000 personnel 
meanwhile the navy announced the activation of hundreds of 
reservists for medical duty in the gulf region 
also the pentagon said cheney and powell will travel to saudi 
arabia next week to visit american troops and to meet with saudi 
government officials

european community leaders today approved a 1 
billion emergency aid package for the soviet union designed to 
fight food shortages and bolster president mikhail s gorbachev 
the proportion of grants and loans still had to be decided 
however and britain france and germany cautioned against 
overloading the troubled soviet economy with debt 
approval of the emergency aid came at the start of a twoday ec 
summit 
all without expection are in agreement to give immediate 
help to the soviet union said summit spokesman pio mastrobuoni 
the european leaders said the soviet food problem had more to do 
with poor distribution than with shortages italian officials said 
the ec food would be targeted for moscow and leningrad 
the ec leaders also were worried about saving gorbachev whose 
political hold is under constant challenge from opponents 
including hardliners and various quarters of soviet society 
german chancellor helmut kohl denounced attempts to undermine 
gorbachev and warned it would be a lot more costly to the rest of 
the world should gorbachev fall than to offer emergency aid now 
the united states joined 20 other countries this week in 
promising or delivering food aid for the soviet union the us 
package included 13 billion in loan guarantees to buy us farm 
products and manufactured goods 
the soviet government said on thursday it had already received 
1700 tons of food and 800 tons of medicine and other aid for the 
difficult winter ahead 
as the soviet union tries to move from a command to a market 
economy it has been unable to prevent shortages caused by its 
inadequate distribution system many countries believe that food 
aid is necessary to give gorbachev breathing room to implement his 
political and economic reforms 
earlier today prime minister john major of britain urged the 
european community at the start of the key summit today not to rush 
into a single currency in its drive for european unity 
i dont think anybody in the community wants confrontation 
said major who replaced margaret thatcher last month after her 
combative stance in europe helped topple the longtime british 
leader 
but he added we cant just leap at it a single currency 
we need to see if it works we need to see if people want it 
his remarks appeared aimed at signaling that britain without 
mrs thatcher will not be trapped into going along with radical 
union plans rather than face continued isolation 
but in a tone markedly different from the resounding 
denunciations of mrs thatcher major cautioned europe has to 
march together we britain must negotiate in a constructive 
spirit and so must our partners 
major 47 spoke to reporters at his hotel in between a 
presummit round of separate talks with italian premier giulio 
andreotti the summit chairman dutch prime minister ruud lubbers 
and chancellor helmut kohl of germany 
the twoday summit held in the flagbedecked italian 
parliament also will debate the persian gulf crisis 
in a letter thursday to andreotti president bush said iraqs 
release of foreign hostages should not lessen pressure on iraq to 
pull out of kuwait 
we must continue to maintain a very rigid attitude bush 
said according to italian officials 
in the presummit meetings major told kohl most people of his 
generation and younger take a very positive view of the community 
its in the national selfinterest said a british official he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
but despite the warmth major faced treading a difficult path 
between ending british isolation and being swept up in the 
frenchgerman drive for european union 
at the october summit andreotti cornered mrs thatcher by 
getting the others to agree to establish a single central banking 
system the prelude to one currency by january 1994 
on political union britain has shifted toward french and german 
proposals for giving the community a formal role in security 
the ec nations are italy france britain ireland spain 
portugal belgium luxembourg the netherlands greece denmark and 
germany

a 750 million mission to study the 
suns poles is in danger because the ulysses spacecraft is wobbling 
for reasons us and european flight controllers dont fully 
understand 
the malfunction developed nov 4 about four weeks after the 
spacecraft was launched by the shuttle discovery the associated 
press has learned the spacecraft was 406 million miles from earth 
today 
officials of nasa and the european space agency confirmed the 
problems existence during interviews this week 
willis meeks ulysses project manager at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory said he is optimistic engineers can repeatedly use the 
spacecrafts thrusters to minimize the wobble when ulysses becomes 
the first spacecraft to orbit the suns poles during 1994 and 1995 
i dont foresee that anybody here or in europe is going to 
write off this mission as a failure said ed smith nasas chief 
scientist for ulysses its a question of how much of the cake 
you want to have 
if corrective maneuvering is successful ulysses would lose only 
20 percent of the information it was designed to collect but if it 
fails we would stand to lose 90 percent of the data said 
edgar page ulysses science coordinator for the european space 
agency 
smith was less pessimistic than page saying that at worst 
ulysses would be unable to transmit 70 percent to 75 percent of the 
information it was designed to collect 
the wobble threatens the mission because it makes it difficult 
for ulysses to keep its main dishshaped antenna pointed at earth 
to transmit the information it collects 
the malfunctioning spacecraft is the latest headache for the 
national aeronautics and space administration which has been 
bedeviled by space shuttle fuel leaks trouble with the hubble 
space telescope and major glitches with an observatory that flew 
aboard shuttle columbia this month 
ulysses is a joint mission of the european space agency which 
supplied the spacecraft and half its science instruments and nasa 
which built the remaining instruments launched the spacecraft and 
is tracking it the mission cost is 750 million including 250 
million for the spacecraft 
ulysses is now flying toward jupiter the planets gravity will 
act like a slingshot in 1992 to hurl ulysses out of the plane in 
which the planets orbit the sun ulysses then will fly over the 
suns polar regions in 1994 and 1995 
the slow wobble unexpectedly developed nov 4 when ulysses 
extended a 24footlong antenna boom which is different than the 
main antenna the boom was designed to study radio signals and 
solar wind waves 
we arent sure why its happening page said 
meeks said the leading theory is that heat from the sun is 
warming one side of the boom while the other side remains cool 
causing the boom to bend the boom then makes the entire spacecraft 
wobble like an offbalance washing machine when it spins it was 
designed to spin to prevent wobbling

here are the latest developments in the persian gulf crisis 
equals 
a c5 military transport plane took off friday from frankfurt 
carrying ambassador to kuwait nathaniel howell among the 23 
americans aboard and 10 nonus citizen family members officials 
said the plane was headed to andrews air force base outside 
washington 
looking surprisingly fit after months of surviving on canned 
tuna howell told reporters before departing that he slept well at 
an airport hotel got a haircut and feasted on sausage bacon and 
eggs for breakfast 
 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff testified friday before the house armed 
services committee on thursday several military officers told the 
panel that bombs and bullets not economic sanctions were the way 
to pry saddam hussein from kuwait 
the pentagon said cheney and powell will travel to saudi arabia 
on tuesday to visit american troops and to meet with saudi 
government officials 
 
in london a report released friday by the medical campaign 
against nuclear weapons said plans being made for gulf war 
casualties will be inadequate 
the group citing a report last month by the washingtonbased 
center for defense information anticipates military and civilian 
casualties of 314000 including 63000 dead in a conflict between 
iraq and the usled multinational force arrayed against it in the 
gulf 
a british ministry of defense spokeswoman speaking on condition 
of anonymity said the medical group was speculating wildly on 
numbers 
 
a flight surgeon who has been denied conscientious objector 
status is hoping his 2weekold hunger strike will get him out of 
the army before he is due to be deployed to saudi arabia next week 
capt david wiggins says he has lost 17 of the 167 pounds he 
carried on his 5foot10inch frame before he began subsisting on 
vitamins and water nov 30 
wiggins 28 said on thursday that he expects to be deployed 
from fort hood texas to the gulf on monday

tens of thousands of people will die in 
sudan next year even if the government permits an international 
relief effort a senior us aid official said today 
it will be impossible under the best possible circumstances to 
avoid starvation deaths in sudan said andrew natsios head of 
the us office for disaster assistance we dont have that 
situation 
natsios said 12 million tons of food will be needed to feed a 
third of the nation in 1991 of that amount only about 200000 
tons has been pledged by donor nations all of sudan apart from 
some eastern regions has been struck by two years of drought 
people already have begun moving to sudans capital khartoum 
from the most seriously effected regions and are forming feeding 
camps said rich machmer the head of the us international agency 
for development aid office in khartoum 
many of the estimated 1 million people who died in the 198485 
ethiopia famine did so in such unhygienic camps from disease and 
diarrhea 
machmer who was aids chief in ethiopia during that famine 
said the food crisis in sudan is more severe and threatens 8 to 9 
million people 
hindering the launch of a major relief effort is the sudan 
governments refusal to admit it has an emergency 
we have got to get the cooperation of the sudanese government 
in this whole effort or its not going to work said natsios in a 
briefing on the work of a regional meeting to coordinate the us 
response to famines in sudan and ethiopia 
it is safe to say there will be tens of thousands of deaths 
said natsios but we want to keep them as low as possible 
the military regime of lt gen omar hassan elbashir has 
acknowledged a food gap of a million tons but has refused to 
respond to western donors urgings that he declare a state of 
emergency 
on monday elbashir said he would accept food donations only if 
his government is in charge of transportaion and distribution 
natsios did not comment on the demand but the united states has 
criticized the government for alleged attacks on grain stocks to 
keep them from reaching areas controlled by southern rebels 
in the past western donors and the united nations have insisted 
on at least partial involvement in transportation and distribution 
to make sure the aid gets to those in need 
the relief effort also faces severe logistical problems in 
sudan a vast impoverished nation of 24 million people where trains 
dont run river barges dont move and telephones dont work the 
neglected road network does not extend far beyond khartoum 
those most imperiled by the current famine are in western an 
southern regions difficult to reach 
in order to get aid to people before its too late 125000 tons 
of relief food needs to arrive at port sudan in the next two weeks 
and continue arriving monthly throughout the year said machmer

foreign minister qian qichen indicated today that 
china will not be moved by the forthcoming visit of a us human 
rights envoy who is expected to call for the release of jailed 
democracy activists 
in a lengthy article excerpted in the official guangming daily 
qian said western countries that criticized chinas domestic 
policies especially the united states already have relaxed their 
stance without china making concessions 
china was not forced to submit nor was it isolated he 
wrote in the article which is to appear in full in this weeks 
issue of the communist party magazine seek truth 
there are still some americans making indiscreet remarks about 
other countries internal affairs we hope they will clearly see 
that although it gives us some difficulties if they cause trouble 
for china it also hurts american interests qian said 
the same hard line was reflected in a protest the foreign 
ministry lodged today with the norwegian government the ministry 
said a recent meeting between norwegian foreign minister thorvald 
stotenberg and escaped chinese dissident chai ling was a gross 
interference in chinas internal affairs 
ms chai a student is wanted by chinese police for her leading 
role in last years massive prodemocracy protests she fled after 
the chinese army opened fire on the demonstrators killing 
hundreds 
qians article appeared three days before the arrival of richard 
schifter us assistant secretary of state for human rights and 
humanitarian affairs 
the us government announced two weeks ago while qian was in 
washington that schifter would visit but has not said what he 
plans to discuss he is expected to plead the cause of hundreds of 
students intellectuals and others who remain jailed for taking 
part in the demonstrations 
the visit is an attempt by the bush administration to 
demonstrate its concern for human rights in china even while it 
eases sanctions against beijing the united states and other 
industrialized democracies halted easyterm loans and weapons sales 
to china and froze highlevel exchanges after the democracy 
movement was crushed 
most of the sanctions have crumbled as the west has sought 
chinas cooperation in the united nations in pressuring iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait the european community lifted all sanctions 
except the ban on weapons sales in october 
although washington said its ban on highlevel exchanges remains 
in place qians official visit to washington appeared to rob the 
sanction of its meaning the united states also has restored 
credits for exports to china allowed the world bank to resume 
lending to china and ended special restrictions on technology 
transfers 
qian wrote that the lifting of sanctions showed the west 
recognized chinas role in the united nations in solving the gulf 
crisis and the cambodian conflict is a weighty one 
official and ordinary americans all want to restore 
chineseamerican relations as quickly as possible he said he 
said china wants to increase its foreign ties but added we wont 
beg from any country

a suspicious fire whipped by high wind 
roared through a densely populated city block early today 
destroying at least seven threefamily houses and forcing dozens of 
families to flee 
no deaths or serious injuries were reported but at least seven 
firefighters and three residents suffered minor injuries 
its amazing there is no loss of life said revere fire 
inspector gene dougherty who described the neighborhood as the 
most congested in the city 
authorities said the fire was one of three suspicious blazes 
overnight within a halfmile or so in this workingclass suburb 
north of boston the other two were far less serious

245 am in a boardedup building and wind gusting up to 30 mph 
blew embers that spread the blaze to nearby occupied homes it was 
declared under control at 640 am 
the wind combined with temperatures in the 20s to produce a 
windchill effect of near zero and firemen had to work on 
icecovered streets some fire engines were completely encased in 
ice 
the threestory frame buildings common to the region are 
called tripledeckers and were built to accommodate three 
families 
fire chief james connery declared the fire a conflagration 
the highest level of fire you can declare when you declare a

assailants shot and killed a rural 
union leader who had defied powerful sugar barons in northeastern 
brazil police said today 
police said jose helio da silva was shot down in a sugar cane 
field thursday near the farm workers union in palmares a 
sugarproducing town in pernambuco state 1600 miles northeast of 
sao paulo 
palmares police chief joaquim donati said da silva and union 
treasurer jose cicero leite were driving along a highway when a car 
started chasing them 
they stopped the car and hid in a cane field but the gunmen 
found them donati said in a telephone interview he said da 
silva was shot once in the back and died instantly leite was 
wounded in the left leg 
the slaying occurred on the second day of the trial of two 
ranchers accused of ambushing and killing environmentalist and 
union leader chico mendes in brazils amazon region in 1988 the 
trial has focused worldwide attention on a cause advocated by 
mendes preserving the brazilian rain forest from ranchers and 
farmers who are cutting it down and according to some 
environomentalists thereby threatening a vital ecosystem and the 
lifestyles of jungle residents da silva recently received an 
anonymous letter warning that he would end up like chico 
mendes according to the president of the farm workers union 
joao luca da silva 
we are sure the gunmen were hired by our enemies the sugar 
and fuel alcohol producers of the region said luca da silva 
who is not related to the victim they wanted him dead because he 
was an excellent strike organizer and was always demanding better 
working conditions and decent wages for sugar cane cutters 
donati said the shooting could have been a personal vendetta 
da silva had a daily radio program in which he always offended all 
kinds of people in the region donati would not say if sugar and 
fuel alcohol producers were among those da silva insulted in his 
program 
the association of sugar and alcohol producers reached by 
telephone said no one was available to comment on the union 
accusations

dozens of mourners came to a moscow cemetery today 
to pay homage to andrei d sakharov the nobel peace prize laureate 
and human rights campaigner who died a year ago 
the legislature of the russian republic opened todays session 
with a tribute to sakharov and national newspapers published 
articles praising him 
at the vostyakovsky cemetery in southwest moscow sakharovs 
headstone was covered in evergreen branches and carnations of all 
colors red sashes were hung on wreaths including one from the 
congress of peoples deputies of russia 
its common knowledge that sakharov was a man of genius but 
he also linked genius with civil courage which i value even 
more said valery zlemin who had come to the cemetery to mark 
the anniversary of sakharovs death civil courage is turning 
words into action 
in the year since sakahrovs death at age 68 friends and 
colleagues in the human rights movement have battled for his cause 
but they say no one has emerged to take his place 
baruch froyimovich a 67yearold pensioner said i cant see 
anybody today who could take his place 
but froyimovich said he was optimistic about the future 
there are enough people in russia who are intelligent talented 
and loyal 
the moscow newspaper leninskoye znamiya said history has 
already had its say on sakharov he belongs to it at the same 
time he is near us he stayed in the hearts of all who wanted to 
have him 
other newspapers printed pictures of sakharov and reprinted 
speeches he made at demonstrations and at the national supreme 
soviet parliament 
since he died of heart failure last year public esteem has 
continued to climb for the physicist who helped invent the soviet 
hydrogen bomb and later won the nobel peace prize for his political 
dissidence 
a decade ago sakharov was denounced in the official press as an 
utterly ignorant person and banished to the industrial city of 
gorky for criticizing the soviet invasion of afghanistan he spent 
seven years in exile before being recalled to moscow by president 
mikhail s gorbachev in 1986 
he later became an outspoken deputy in the supreme soviet 
parliament and champion of the human rights movement

a us government delegation is in europe seeking 
to unfreeze manuel noriegas bank accounts for use in his legal 
defense a federal prosecutor said today 
the delegation consists of state department and justice 
department officials who are visiting austria and switzerland but 
most details of their visit are secret said assistant us 
attorney michael sullivan 
about 20 million is sitting in 27 noriegalinked accounts and 
us district judge william hoeveler has ordered 6 million of 
those funds paid into a trust account to cover attorneys fees and 
expenses for the deposed panamanian dictator who says he has no 
other funds 
the delegations visit is to discuss the possibility of 
unfreezing the accounts that are being designated as the 
generals sullivan said the discussions are ongoing 
until the funds are freed the judge asked noriegas defense 
counsel to take a temporary appointment as governmentpaid 
attorneys but they id not immediately respond lead attorney 
frank rubino has previously rejected that arrangement because fees 
are limited to a maximum of 75 an hour far less than the 350 an 
hour he says is appropriate in a complex drugtrafficking case 
the us delegation was sent to europe after hoeveler said he 
would hold a formal hearing to make prosecutors justify freezing 
the assets that would force them to reveal much of their case in 
advance the defense has said 
the funds were originally frozen at us request following the 
december 1989 invasion of panama and the subsequent capture of 
noriega 
but in june the judge ordered the money unfrozen for noriegas 
defense last month however federal prosecutors told the judge 
that foreign governments had initiated their own forfeiture 
proceedings tying up the money 
also at todays hearing the judge said he would set a new trial 
date for noriega although some of his codefendants could be tried 
on jan 28 as planned rubino said the defense could not be ready 
before june at the earliest and hoeveler said he would take that 
under advisement 
the judge also said he wanted a contempt hearing soon against 
cnn to determine if the network violated a court order by 
telecasting a taped prison telephone call between noriega and his 
defense team while transcripts from the tapes eventually were made 
public cnns decision last month to telecast parts of them despite 
a court order is still at issue 
noriega attorney jon may said the network had informed him it 
will present a full defense against the contempt citation a 
defense which legal experts have said could once again test the 
balance between freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial 
noriega is confined in the metropolitan correctional center 
outside miami facing charges of accepting 46 million in bribes to 
turn panama into a way station for colombian drug traffickers

canadian lawmakers have passed an unpopular new 
tax on goods and services ending months of procedural delays 
the bill pushed through the senate on thursday night by prime 
minister brian mulroneys conservatives now only needs the 
formality of royal consent to become law the vote was 5549 
the opposition liberals were outraged saying the conservative 
maneuver to end an 11month filibuster to force the vote was 
illegal 
the goods and services tax known familiarly as the gst imposes 
a 7 percent federal levy on nearly all merchandise and services 
beginning jan 1 the tax is added on top of provincial sales 
taxes which range from 8 to 10 percent 
that means the buying public will have 15 to 17 percent tacked 
on to nearly all purchases including such things as haircuts 
music lessons and even postage 
the gst has been languishing in the unelected senate since it 
was passed by the house of commons in april the bill was taken up 
actively with the opening of the autumn session of parliament on 
sept 25 
the liberals pledged to kill the tax which polls showed was 
opposed by 75 percent to 85 percent of the people 
more recent polls indicated people were tiring of the debate 
delaying tactics in the senate included hooting catcalls 
shouting blowing kazoos interminable reading of petitions name by 
name and other delaying measures 
more than 13 million businesses will help the government 
collect the tax 
many have spent the last few months reprograming their cash 
registers and computers and adjusting their pricing in anticipation 
of the tax 
any delay from the original jan 1 deadline for implementation 
could throw much of canadian business into confusion 
the liberals held a majority in the senate until recently 
in october mulroney used an obscure neverbefore implemented 
section of the constitution that allowed him to ask queen elizabeth 
ii to appoint eight extra senators by filling vacant seats and 
getting the queen to appoint eight more mulroney succeeded in 
packing the senate in his favor 
angry liberals said the forced vote violated senate rules 
the gst is supposed to replace the 135 percent manufacturers 
sales tax which raises about 10 billion a year but is considered 
inefficient and levied on a very narrow base the argument is that 
the manufacturers sales tax discriminates heavily against industry 
and hurts canadian exporting firms 
one of the great fears of the public is that once the gst is 
passed government will be tempted to increase the rate with such 
a broad base small rate increases can raise enormous amounts of 
revenue

william bennetts abrupt decision to reject 
the republican partys top job leaves the gop scrambling for a 
leader while still reeling from a dispiriting performance in 1990 
elections 
but there are indications the vacuum wont exist too long 
administration and party sources said thursday that president bush 
hopes to choose a replacement soon and that the list of candidates 
likely will be short 
mentioned most frequently as possibilities following bennetts 
surprise announcement thursday were three cabinet secretaries 
samuel skinner of transportation robert mosbacher of commerce and 
jack kemp of housing and urban development and attorney thomas 
loeffler a former texas congressman and a close friend of bush 
one gop source said the president spoke with loeffler about the 
job thursday but had not offered it a loeffler associate said 
today that loeffler had spoken to white house chief of staff john 
sununu about the post the associate said he did not believe 
loeffler had spoken directly to the president 
he is of course interested said the associate mike 
johnson who said loeffler was in texas 
others mentioned for the job included longtime gop operative 
rich bond and republican national committeeman haley barbour of 
mississippi a key party strategist in the south 
republican sources said bond is lobbying for the job but 
barbour said in a telephone interview he wasnt interested adding 
i just dont have an interest in it i am not soliciting the job 
and would not want it if asked 
two republican house members who lost senate bids lynn martin 
of illinois and pat saiki of hawaii were considered long shots as 
was minnesota sen rudy boschwitz who lost his reelection bid 
martin and saiki are contenders for vacant cabinet posts at the 
labor and education departments 
bennett saying i didnt take a vow of poverty spurned 
bushs offer to head the republican national committee after white 
house lawyers told him hed have to give up a book contract and 
other outside income 
bushs penchant for surprises left gop analysts reluctant to 
make predictions 
sam skinner would be a good possibility there are a lot of 
people out there who would be good as chairman but i cant say 
anyone is at the top of the list right now said charles black a 
political consultant who has been the top rnc spokesman during 
chairman lee atwaters battle against an inoperable brain tumor 
black too was among those mentioned as a potential successor 
to his close friend atwater but he said he told bush he was not 
interested 
democrats took delight in the gops embarrassment 
it is appropriate that bill bennetts tenure at the rnc lasted 
about as long as most of president bushs campaign promises 
democratic chairman ron brown said 
the rnc meets jan 25 with its top priority installing a new 
chairman to lead the party into the crucial 1992 elections the gop 
had a disappointing performance in the nov 6 offyear elections 
as democrats strengthened their hold on congress and captured the 
governorships of florida and texas from the gop 
bennett emerged as bushs pick within weeks of announcing he was 
resigning as the nations drug czar and bush made his choice 
official on nov 30 
the choice of bennett was widely interpreted as an attempt by 
bush to make amends with the partys vocal conservative wing never 
high on bush and openly at war with the white house since the 
president dumped his no new taxes campaign pledge 
conservatives demanded that one of their own be tapped in 
bennetts stead 
now if the party chairmanship went to a member of the bush 
wing conservatives would feel seduced and abandoned even more than 
before said richard viguerie chairman of united conservatives 
of america the clear message to conservatives would be we dont 
need you 
vigueie and his allies were pushing kemp for the post but a 
top kemp aide said the housing secretary was not interested and 
kemp has several differences with the president on domestic issues 
including taxes

a usmanufactured board game that uses derogatory 
language toward japanese minorities is being pulled from store 
shelves by its japanese distributor a company official said today 
the instruction manual for the game land of ninja uses a 
disparaging name for a former japanese outcast class and calls 
another minority group barbarians 
we have decided to completely stop selling the game because 
some people have objected to it said kosuke fukumoto an 
official of hobby japan co the distributor 
he said the company also has halted plans to produce a 
japaneselanguage version of the roleplaying game which is based 
on feudal japanese society 
although less than 200 copies of the game were sold in japan at 
a list price of 35 the distributor moved quickly to withdraw it 
after it was criticized by the buraku liberation league 
the league which claims 200000 members has fought 
discrimination faced by burakumin a former outcast group estimated 
to number between 1 million and 3 million out of japans total 
population of 123 million 
hundreds of years ago the burakumin or village people worked 
in religiously proscribed occupations such as butchering and 
leather working they lived in special neighborhoods or buraku 
and when maps were drawn the buraku were omitted 
although racially identical to other japanese the burakumin 
continue to face difficulties in employment and marriage more than 
100 years after their outcast status was officially abolished in 
1871 
japans family registry system allows people to be traced to 
their ancestral communities although public access to the 
registries has been limited in recent years 
we definitely feel there are serious problems with the game 
a league official said 
the league said it plans to send a delegation to the united 
states to meet with the maker of the game baltimorebased avalon 
hill game co 
in the game players make a journey after being assigned roles 
such as samurai warrior ninja or buddhist priest the manual 
describes feudal japan by dividing all occupations into four 
descending hierarchical groups nobles samurai commoners and 
eta 
the latter term a derogatory name for burakumin meaning great 
filth is defined in the game as those outside normal society 
such as ninja thieves and entertainers 
the game introduced in 1987 also refers to native ainu people 
another minority as barbarian inhabitants of northern japan 
in reporting the games withdrawal several japanese newspapers 
suggested a comparison between us insensitivity to japanese 
minority issues and japanese insensitivity to american racial 
problems 
in september us minority groups demanded the dismissal of 
justice minister seiroku kajiyama after he compared american blacks 
to prostitutes in japan he said prostitutes ruin the atmosphere 
of the neighborhoods they move into the area is becoming mixed 
just like in america where blacks move in and whites are forced 
out 
kajiyama apologized for the remarks and prime minister toshiki 
kaifu pledged to improve japanese understanding of us minority 
issues

a london newspaper today quoted sources close to 
the public inquiry into the 1988 pan am flight 103 bombing as 
saying they have proof that libya was responsible 
the independent quoted the unidentified highlevel sources as 
saying the conclusion was based on analysis of a detonator fragment 
found in a field close to the southern scottish town of lockerbie 
it said the evidence had come to light only in the past three 
months 
the newspaper said the confirmation of libyan involvement 
refutes a theory that syrianbased palestinian faction was 
responsible for the bombing 
it quoted the sources as saying action now against libya could 
alienate arab members of the international force in the persian 
gulf and for that reason no indictments had been issued against 
the major suspects 
a spokesman for the lord advocate lord fraser scotlands 
senior law officer said he could not comment on media 
speculation 
but indictments are not being drawn up said the spokesman 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the boeing 747 was blown up over lockerbie on dec 21 1988 
while on its way to new york all 259 people on board and 11 others 
on the ground were killed the flight originated in frankfurt 
germany with a stop at londons heathrow airport 
investigators have concluded that a bomb hidden in a 
radiocassette recorder was responsible for the explosion but 
speculation has varied wildly on which group planned the bombing 
a public inquiry into the bombing opened at dumfries near 
lockerbie on oct 1 it was adjourned on dec 7 until jan 22 
previous reports had speculated that the bombing was planned by 
a germanbased cell of the radical damascusbased popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command headed by ahmed 
jibril the palestinians reportedly made the bomb with semtex a 
czechoslovak explosive 
the independent quoted the sources as saying the detonator 
fragment was identical to a swissmanufactured fragment found in a 
radiocassette bomb seized from two libyan secret agents arrested 
at dakar airport in senegal in february 1988 10 months before the 
flight 103 attack 
the paper reported reports of possible libyan involvement 
have surfaced recently in the french and us media but for the 
first time senior sources have now confirmed that proof exists 
implicating libyan leader col moammar gadhafis regime 
it quoted one of the sources as saying not only do we now 
know gadhafi was responsible he also knows we know 
the paper quoted the sources as saying any us action against 
libya would risk alienating arab members of the usled 
multinational force arrayed against iraq in the persian gulf 
for that reason no indictments have yet been issued against 
the prime suspects and the force of scottish detectives in charge 
of the criminal investigation into the bombing has not formally 
been given the new evidence by other elements of the international 
inquiry team it reported 
the team includes members of the fbi cia and german and british 
intelligence agencies

they were last years heartwarming 
christmas story a man giving his brother a 9 million lottery 
ticket but the gift earl havlock gave his brother this year was a 
lawsuit demanding the money back 
the suit was filed in superior court on monday the same day the 
commission that operates the tristate megabucks lottery issued a 
news release recalling last years events and saying the brothers 
epitomized the spirit of the holidays 
they did last year thats for sure new hampshire 
sweepstakes director james wimsatt said thursday times change 
earl 43 won the tristate megabucks lottery jackpot two days 
before christmas last year and turned his winning ticket over to 
elwood 50 after taxes the prize amounted to 20 annual payments 
of 357600 the first payment was made last december 
earl three other brothers and a sister claim that earl is 
mentally disabled and had no intention of giving away his winnings 
the petition says earl told sweeps officials and the public that he 
bought the winning ticket as a christmas present for elwood which 
wasnt true after elwood told him that holding onto the jackpot 
would jeopardize his monthly disability payments 
earl who is unable to work was getting by on social security 
checks and money from elwood last year when he bought the ticket 
at the time he said that the ticket for the mainenew 
hampshirevermont lottery was a christmas gift and he never 
considered keeping it even after he knew it was a winner 
his brothers advice was to misrepresent to the tristate 
megabucks commission that this was a gift from earl to elwood 
said the plaintiffs lawyer robert foley but a side deal to 
require elwood to share the money with all six was not made public 
thats the deception that is coming back to haunt all of them 
foley said it boils down to an agreement that has not worked out 
as the brothers and sister had hoped 
it is important for the havlocks to let people know they are 
not angry at their brother elwood he said they felt this 
litigation is necessary to set the record straight 
foley said earl has a mental disability saying he is very 
unsophisicated perhaps gullible and not very knowledgeable about 
money or the law 
foley said part of the reason for filing the suit was that 
elwoods wife rowena is claiming a portion of the winnings in a 
divorce action 
rowena was making claim on half the jackpot he said 
there was no answer at elwoods home this morning his lawyer 
stephen kain of laconia could not comment because he was in a 
meeting a secretary said today 
wimsatt said unless the court rules otherwise the money will 
continue to go to elwood because he signed the form claiming the 
lottery prize 
we honor the winner claim form as presented he said he 
gave it to his brother and his brother filed a claim

with spring arriving in the southern 
hemisphere the antarctic ozone hole is closing for the season 
national oceanic and atmospheric adminsitration scientists reported 
friday 
the hole is filling in late this year said samuel b oltmans of 
noaas climate monitoring and diagnostics laboratory in boulder 
colo 
the delay was caused by a circle of persistent winds surrounding 
the antarctic continent which prevented air there from mixing with 
the atmosphere from other regions 
noaa reported that ozone levels over antarctica climbed to 220 
dobson units on dec 6 and to 270 units by dec 10 according to 
measurements made by instruments sent aloft by balloons 
ozone over the south pole reached a low of 130 dobson units in 
early october only marginally above the record low measured in 
1987 
that thinning of the layer is sometimes referred to as a hole 
although it amounts to somewhat less than half of the normal ozone 
level of over 300 units in that part of the world 
ozone while considered a pollutant at ground level is vital in 
the upper atmosphere where it blocks a portion of the hazardous 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun 
a reduction in ozone could lead to damage to crops and animal 
life and an increase in skin cancer among humans some scientists 
warm 
researchers are concerned that loss of ozone over the antarctic 
could indicate a reduction in other areas also although evidence 
has yet to be found of such a reduction 
the ozone thinning occurs as chemicals react with that gas in 
the extreme cold of the upper atmosphere in winter now that summer 
is returning to antarctica warmer temperatures inhibit those 
chemical reactions and the ozone hole begins to fill in again 
the dobson unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing how 
much of each of two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed by the air 
that ratio changes depending on the concentration of ozone

the last us evacuation flight headed home today as defense 
secretary dick cheney kept the pressure on baghdad telling 
congress that patience is not producing results in world 
efforts to push iraq from kuwait 
two republican senators said today that president bush is 
prepared to call off planned usiraqi talks on the persian gulf 
crisis because the two nations have been unable to agree when to 
meet but the white house said that while bush is upset with iraq 
he is not prepared to abandon efforts to hold talks 
a group of pacifist physicians said today the west is unprepared 
to cope with the thousands of people who could be injured or killed 
if fighting breaks out in the gulf while other doctors headed to 
the region to try to avert war 
a c5 military transport plane took off from frankfurt carrying 
ambassador to kuwait nathaniel howell among the 23 americans 
aboard 10 nonus citizen family members officials said also 
aboard were 15 people going to canada the plane was headed to 
andrews air force base outside washington 
looking surprisingly fit after months of surviving on canned 
tuna howell told reporters before departing that he slept well at 
an airport hotel got a haircut and feasted on sausage bacon and 
eggs for breakfast 
we have a lot of cholesterol to make up for he joked a 
reference to the 110day ordeal at the besieged us embassy in 
kuwait following iraqs invasion of the emirate aug 2 
until washington said he could leave thursday hoell and his 
fourmember staff in kuwait had defied iraqi orders to close 
foreign missions british envoys who had been the only other 
holdouts were also expected to leave 
howell and his staff left on the last us charter to evacuate 
westerners who had been held by iraqi president saddam hussein to 
deter a us attack hundreds of westerners have left since saddam 
announced a blanket release of hostages on dec 6 and us 
officials said all other americans who wish to leave can take 
commercial transportation 
in washington cheney told the house armed services committee 
that if the economic attempts and diplomatic efforts to solve the 
crisis fail the united states must have the option of using force 
to oust iraq from kuwait 
having a capacity for patience does not mean we must remain 
patient when patience is not producing results we must always have 
other options cheney said he was responding to democratic calls 
to give economic sanctions against iraq more time 
sens richard lugar rind and john mccain rariz met with 
bush this morning and said bush is prepared to call off us talks 
with baghdad aimed at heading off war 
the two governments have been unable to agree on a date for 
secretary of state james a baker iii to visit baghdad to talk to 
saddam and for iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to meet with bush 
in washington the administration wants the aziz meeting next week 
and the baker talks by early january 
the president as i gather his mood today is prepared to 
have no meetings rather than to see a lot of shoving around if 
we have no meetings so be it lugar told reporters 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the two senators 
who met with bush went too far when they told reporters the 
president was prepared to abandon efforts to set dates for the 
talks 
the presidents concerned and hes upset that saddam cant 
set an acceptable date for the baker talks but the president 
proposed them the talks and wants them to happen fitzwater 
said 
on the financial markets meanwhile traders said the continued 
statemate of usiraqi talks drove oil prices up in trading today 
light sweet crude oil for january delivery was up 143 per barrel 
at 2785 early this afternoon on the new york mercantile exchange 
saddam has an estimated 500000 troops massed in kuwait and 
southern iraq facing about 350000 antiiraqi soldiers including 
an american force of 250000 that should grow to 400000 by 
midjanuary 
in london a report released today by the medical campaign 
against nuclear weapons said plans being made for gulf war 
casualties will be inadequate 
the group citing a report last month by the washingtonbased 
center for defense information anticipates military and civilian 
casualties of 314000 including 63000 dead in a gulf conflict 
a british ministry of defense spokeswoman speaking on condition 
of anonymity said medical group was speculating wildly on numbers 
the medical campaign against nuclear war is the british 
affiliate of the international physicians for the prevention of 
nuclear war which announced thursday it was sending a peace 
delegation to the gulf today the organization represents more than 
200000 doctors

the ulysses spacecraft is wobbling like 
an offbalance washing machine threatening to cripple the 750 
million useuropean mission to study the suns poles 
ulysses launched from space shuttle discovery on oct 6 
started gyrating on nov 4 the associated press learned 
officials this week confirmed the problems existence and said 
they hope they can work around the malfunction so it doesnt 
significantly harm ulysses fiveyear mission 
the wobble will leave the spacecrafts main dishshaped antenna 
unable to point at earth continuously 
if we cant do anything about it its very serious said 
edgar page ulysses science coordinator for the european space 
agency the loss of data could range from 20 percent to 90 percent 
he said 
the data is to be transmitted to earth during 19941995 when 
the spacecraft would be the first to orbit the suns polar regions 
engineers hope to minimize the wobble during critical periods by 
repeatedly firing the spacecrafts thrusters 
gloom is something i dont feel said willis meeks ulysses 
project manager at nasas jet propulsion laboratory im sure 
that somehow during the next four years well find a way to learn 
to live with this problem 
page said that for several tense days late last month mission 
officials worried that they might permanently lose contact with the 
250 million spacecraft 
ulysses trouble is yet another in a series of problems for the 
national aeronautics and space administration others include a 
flawed mirror on the hubble space telescope space shuttle fuel 
leaks and a malfunctioning astro observatory on the most recent 
shuttle flight 
the jet propulsion laboratory here has successfully handled 
balky spacecraft including a stuck camera platform on one of the 
voyagers and magellans radio blackouts 
ulysses is a joint mission of the european space agency which 
supplied the spacecraft and half its science instruments and nasa 
which built the remaining instruments launched the spacecraft and 
is tracking it 
on friday it was 406 million miles from earth flying toward a 
1992 encounter with jupiter 
the planets gravity will act like a slingshot to hurl ulysses 
toward solar orbit ulysses is supposed to loop around the suns 
south pole during mayseptember 1994 and over its north pole during 
mayseptember 1995 
the slow wobble technically called nutation suddenly 
developed nov 4 when ulysses extended a 24footlong antenna 
boom the boom designed to study radio signals in space and waves 
in the solar wind may have become bent 
it is a very big wobble we were all amazed page told ap 
network news 
the wobble diminished in recent days as ulysses moved farther 
from the sun and the antenna is shaded by the spacecraft meeks 
said 
because of that the leading suspected culprit is that heat from 
the sun bent the boom meeks and page said 
if the theory is right the wobble soon should disappear for a 
while but page said it will return during the critical times when 
ulysses is studying the suns poles 
ulysses doesnt need to get close to the sun only fly past the 
poles so it never will be closer to the sun than it was on the day 
it was launched 
engineers theorize the bent boom makes ulysses wobble as it 
spins much like an offcentered washing machine agitator the 
spacecraft was designed to spin so it wouldnt wobble the boom 
cant be retracted 
page said he didnt think ulysses builder dornier deutsche 
aerospace of germany was to blame the company appeared to 
satisfy all the test requirements we had he said

industrial production plunged 17 percent in 
november its steepest drop since the last recession the federal 
reserve said friday many analysts expressed concern over the 
quickness and severity of the slump in the manufacturing sector 
all notions that the economy might skirt a recession are 
dashed by the report said william k macreynolds an economist 
with the us chamber of commerce clearly the economy rapidly is 
falling to a degree not anticipated by most analysts just two short 
months ago 
its pretty clear that the weakness in the last couple of 
months has been pretty severe added economist robert brusca of 
nikko securities co international in new york if this isnt 
what a recession is i dont know what one is 
the fed said the drop was the steepest since output sank 20 
percent in december 1982 as the nation began crawling out of the 
last recession 
the decline began with a 01 percent tumble in september 
followed by a 09 percent fall in october both months were revised 
downward from a positive 02 percent in september and a negative 
08 percent in october 
the dramatic declines indicate the manufacturing sector is 
suffering along with the rest of the economy as the business cycle 
takes a turn for the worse said economist mark m zandi of 
regional financial associates in west chester pa 
but zandi and others while acknowledging the bleak 
industrial production report found some hope in fridays commerce 
department report that business inventories grew a modest 04 
percent in october while sales expanded 09 percent 
that resulted in an inventorytosales ratio of 147 down from 
148 the previous month the ratio means it would take 147 months 
to exhaust the backlog of goods at the october sales pace the 
ratio reached a 174 in january 1982 during the last recession 
the fact that inventories remained lean suggests that although 
were in a slowdown theres not a lot of inventory correction 
needed and that will keep the slowdown mild and of shorter 
duration he said 
evelina tainer an economist with first national bank of 
chicago said the ratio suggests unemployment will go up but not 
as much as in past recessions major inventory accumulations 
could cause growing production cutbacks and even larger job layoffs 
as businesses attempt to sell off the backlog 
nevertheless the labor department still reported that 200000 
factory jobs were lost in november the biggest onemonth drop 
since 1982 since reaching a postrecession peak in january 1989 
manufacturing employment has declined by 800000 
a 20 percent drop in motor vehicle assemblies coupled with a 
sharp curtailment in output of related parts and materials 
accounted for more than half of the overall loss in industrial 
output the fed said but all categories posted declines 
production at manufacturing plants making both durable and 
nondurable goods also plummeted 17 percent for its third 
consecutive drop 
output of durable goods usually expensive products expected to 
last more than three years sank 25 percent after a 11 percent 
drop in october 
manufacturing of nondurable goods which has been declining 
since july dropped 06 percent after 04 percent drops in both 
september and october 
utility production fell 36 percent its third straight decline 
while output at mines inched down 01 percent after a 10 percent 
drop in october 
the fed said its industrial production index in november stood 
at 1075 percent of its 1987 base down from 1094 percent a month 
earlier it matched the level of last january which was the lowest 
since the index stood at 1074 percent in december 1988 
the fed also said the operating rate of the nations factories 
mines and utilities dropped 15 percentage point to 809 percent of 
capacity the operating rate measures not only output but also 
changes in productivity levels 
the operating rate at factories was 800 percent down from 816 
percent in october the operating rate at mines was unchanged at 
896 percent for utilities it fell to 827 percent from 859 
percent a month earlier

anc president oliver tambo on 
friday urged the black opposition group to review its stand on 
international sanctions against south africa a cornerstone of the 
antiapartheid campaign 
tambo who returned thursday from 30 years of exile told the 
opening session of the african national congress consultative 
conference that it had to revamp its strategy in step with the 
evolving political situation in south africa 
noting worldwide support for president fw de klerks reforms 
tambo suggested that the anc would be wise to develop a more 
lenient policy on sanctions before foreign nations dropped them 
altogether 
it is no longer enough for us to repeat the tried slogans 
tambo said in a speech that could mark a major change in the ancs 
position 
we should therefore carefully reevaluate the advisability of 
insisting on the retention of sanctions given the new developments 
in the country and abroad 
both tambo and nelson mandela the anc deputy president praised 
changes in the whiteled government that made the historic 
threeday conference possible but they said the fight against 
white domination would continue 
it was the ancs first meeting in south africa since the group 
was outlawed 30 years ago and it brought together scores of black 
activists who spent years in prison or exile for antiapartheid 
activities 
more than 40 black activists sat at a long table draped with the 
green black and gold colors of the anc behind them a 
checkerboard of 25 television screens gave the 1600 delegates 
closeup views of their aged leaders 
tambo 73 who is still suffering the effects of a stroke 16 
months ago received a standing ovation as he walked slowly to his 
place at the head of the table amid chants of tambo tambo 
speaking haltingly at first tambos voice gained strength 
during the nearly hourlong opening address 
in a tribute to the activists who were imprisoned or died during 
the past three decades he said it is thanks to you that today 
the dignity of a black person is being restored and together with 
it the dignity of our beloved country 
of de klerks reforms which include legalization of the anc and 
the repeal of some apartheid laws tambo said naturally our 
hopes are raised 
but he urged blacks not to let down their guard and called the 
ongoing political unrest a painful reminder that apartheid is 
firmly in place 
tambo thanked foreign nations for imposing sanctions on south 
africa but noted that pressure was building from some countries to 
lift them 
leaders of the 12nation european community are expected to 
discuss whether to continue sanctions at a summit that opened 
friday in rome 
mandela did not specifically refer to sanctions in a 22page 
speech but he said continuing pressure from the international 
communitymust be maintained 
foreign governments have also imposed sports and cultural 
boycotts against south africa and limited diplomatic contacts 
a draft discussion document on sanctions which was to be 
reviewed privately by anc delegates said the economic measures 
should remain because the white minority continues to govern the 
country 
the pamphlet was marked confidential and was contained in 
media packets the independent south african press association said 
the anc accidentally leaked the document 
it suggested that boycotts on sports and cultural exchanges 
could be eased 
it isclear that we cannot continue to call for the 
maintenance of existing measures without running the risk of 
placing ourselves in a position in which we will be seen to have 
suffered a major defeat if countries begin loosening the 
sanctions the pamphlet said 
mandela was far more militant than tambo warning that the 
suspension of the ancs armed struggle was just that a temporary 
suspension 
the rallying cry of the day to all our members wherever they 
are deployed is remain at your posts he said 
the focus of the meeting which ends sunday is to plan anc 
strategy and the groups approach to talks with the whiteled 
government on power sharing with the black majority 
de klerk has promised to end apartheid and negotiate a new 
constitution to include the nations 30 million blacks who 
currently have no voice in national affairs the 5 million whites 
control the government

a threejudge panel called the remarks by broward circuit judge 
paul m marko iii inappropriate and reversed his decisions it 
returned the case to the circuit court and suggested marko withdraw 
because he could not be fair 
at the nov 27 1989 divorce trial marko repeatedly told

marko 58 a divorced father of two who has been a judge since 
1969 later apologized to marianne price and expressed his regrets 
for what he called a poor choice of words 
the judge was not available thursday when called at his office 
marianne price said the judges remarks devastated her at the 
time but was too afraid of marko to object to his treatment of her 
she said she was pleased with the appeals court action 
it renews my faith in the judicial system ms price said 
no useful purpose could be served by a recitation of the many 
comments made by the trial judge to or concerning the wife during 
the trial the court said wednesday 
in its decision the appeals court said marko wrongfully 
restricted marianne price from having a man live in her house while 
saying her husband could have as many women as he wanted in his 
home

marianne price and ordered it set by a broward judge

the national endowment for the arts was told 
friday to comply with congress new decency standard by 
ensuring its grantjudging panels reflect the widest possible 
diversity of american cultural values 
this procedural solution was approved by members of the national 
council on the arts the neas presidentially appointed advisory 
body who met informally at a downtown hotel to discuss the 
implications of legislation congress approved in october 
council members effectively rejected a stronger alternative that 
would have required written or oral guidelines on decency for the 
nea panels of outside experts who review applications for federal 
arts grants 
after the vote endowment chairman john e frohnmayer expressed 
approval of the councils approach and said im not going to be 
the decency czar here 
when it approved a 174 million budget for the arts endowment 
this year congress repealed a yearold obscenity ban and 
substituted a requirement that the nea take general standards of 
decency into account when awarding federal grant money 
both restrictions were prompted by conservative lawmakers 
criticism of nea support for exhibitions of controversial works by 
photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano that 
were denounced as obscene and blasphemous 
though milder than the obscenity ban the new decency standard 
has stirred emotional fire from some artists and arts supporters 
who contend that it also would hamper freedom of expression 
in a statement read at fridays council meeting members of the 
nea panel on opera and musical theater declared their unanimous 
opposition to the decency standard and said they would disregard 
it 
standards of decency are subjective indefinable and 
irrelevant to the consideration of artistic excellence which is 
the primary concern of this panel and the national endowment for 
the arts said their signed statement 
we have vehemently opposed and avoided any consideration of 
decency as a funding criteria during our deliberations the 
panelists wrote 
nea general counsel julie davis told council members that 
decency was a very slippery very broad and very vague standard 
that almost defies definition 
she recommended that the nea comply with the new standard by 
broadening the membership of its grantjudging panels giving oral 
instructions to panelists or writing the standard into the 
endowments formal guidelines 
on a unanimous voice vote council members approved the nea 
lawyers first option under which panelists would be appointed to 
represent a broad range of ethnic racial and geographic 
backgrounds and diverse cultural viewpoints 
such an allinclusive membership ms davis said would provide 
the best assurance that general standards of decency would be 
considered in selecting works of artistic excellence for federal 
support 
rep paul henry rmich a leading house advocate of the 
decency standard said in a telephone interview from grand rapids 
that he was satisfied with the arts councils approach 
i have no objection to that whatsoever so long as general 
standards of decency are honored he said 
henry said the decency standard was inserted into the law 
because congress wanted the arts endowment not legislators to 
be the judges of which works are suitable for support with federal 
funds 
the twoday council meeting which began friday was attended by 
a dozen of the councils 26 members their recommendations will be 
referred to the full council for action at its next quarterly 
meeting in february

officer of conrail said on friday he cannot rule out employee 
layoffs next year if freight revenue is cut by the expected 
economic downturn 
hagen said he was not actually predicting layoffs in conrails 
labor force of 28000 
but when you look at that economic situation youd be foolish 
to say no no layoffs he said 
were not looking for a strong 1991 hagen told the 
transportation table a biweekly meeting of professionals with an 
interest in the transportation industry 
he said he believes the year will see a downturn in housing 
starts and the auto and steel industry all of which would 
translate to less railroad freight 
the gross national product gnp probably will be off by about 
one percent next year he said 
facing a decline in revenue conrail will attempt to reduce 
costs without effecting the quality of its freight service he 
said 
its not going to be a good economic year hagen said but

a whos who of hollywood and network tv 
executives descended upon the federal communications commission on 
friday to do battle over ownership and syndication rights to 
primetime programs 
more than 30 witnesses including the heads of abc nbc cbs 
fox broadcasting and toplevel studio executives rubbed elbows in 
a rare public hearing before the fivemember fcc to debate changing 
the commissions financial interest and syndication rule 
commission chairman alfred sikes ringed by a halfdozen tv 
cameras said it was the largestever washington gathering of tv 
executives 
the rule adopted in 1970 prohibits tv networks from holding a 
financial interest in primetime programs they obtain from outside 
sources or selling them in the us rerun marketplace 
the networks want out from under finsyn as its known and 
since 1983 have been locked in acrimonious negotiations with 
producers over changing the rule commissioner james quello said 
finsyn has generated the most intense lobbying of his 16 years at 
the fcc 
fox inc chairman barry diller whose network has a oneyear 
exemption to finsyn said the issue no longer was producer access 
to mass audiences but a battle about money about greed 
the fcc tentatively decided in 1983 to revamp the rule but 
backed off under pressure from congress and thenpresident reagan 
the commission will decide the issue next year 
thursday one witness after another told the commissioners why 
the rule was or was not vital to both the tv industry and the 
american viewing public 
abc nbc and cbs claim the rule is outdated in an era in which 
they no longer are the only outlets for programs and when they must 
compete against foreign companies that are not bound by finsyn 
network executives complained that advertising sales were down 
and their audiences were at historic lows because of cable tv vcrs 
and other competitors 
the existing regulatory structure created both by the 
commission and by the congress provides an enormous advantage to 
the hollywood and cable interests laurence tisch president of 
cbs inc told the hearing the future of free broadcasting in 
america is seriously threatened not just for the networks but for 
our 600 affiliated stations repealing these rules is important 
because it will allow us to compete for the best programming 
producers however claimed that while the industry has changed 
dramatically since finsyn was imposed 20 years ago the three 
networks still have bottleneck control of major highquality 
programming without finsyn they said the networks could once 
again extract many concessions from producers in return for putting 
a program on the air 
perhaps whereas they were once 900pound gorillas today they 
weigh in at only 850 pounds said richard frank president of 
walt disney studios 
but john agoglia president of nbc enterprises and robert iger 
president of abc entertainment said it was the producers not 
networks that have the most bargaining power and that the networks 
needed to foster as many program suppliers as possible 
no network executive has the leverage to force a producer 
with or without a studio to enter into a transaction iger said 
over 70 percent of our series come from major studios said 
jeff sagansky president of cbs entertainment he said cbs would 
lose tens of millions of dollars this year on dallas 
because its producers threatened to go to fox unless cbs accepted 
the aging series along with knots landing and falcon 
crest 
the finsyn rule was designed to stem network power encourage 
independent production of tv shows and keep the networks from 
denying reruns to nonnetwork tv stations since 1970 the 
networks share of audiences has dropped from about 95 percent to 
less than 60 percent as cable viewing has grown 
the advertising marketplace is the worst its been in two 
decades said robert wright president of nbc the three 
network percentage of prime time viewing fell to 58 percent in 
november a historic low 
the justice department has sided with the networks but a wide 
array of groups are on the other side 
the rule has fueled the growth of independent stations and 
contrary to network contentions has also promoted a substantial 
increase in the number of program producers warner bros 
chairman robert daly said the networks want repeal so that they 
may use their tremendous leverage to take valuable financial 
interests and syndication rights 
producers say they could accepted limited network ownership of 
their programs but that syndication and other rights must be 
negotiated separately after a show is placed on the network 
schedule

president bush said today direct talks with 
iraq to resolve the persian gulf crisis are on hold pending an 
agreement with saddam hussein on a date for secretary of state 
james a bakers trip to baghdad 
the foreign minister of iraq tariq aziz had been expected in 
washington next week for the first round of talks but bush said 
saddams proposal of jan 12 for a return visit from baker was too 
close to the un deadline for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
we have offered 15 dates and he ought to get moving and 
accept one bush said of saddam he added saddam hussein is not 
too busy to see on short notice such figures as muhammad ali 
ramsey clark and former british prime minister edward heath 
bush said jan 12 wouldnt leave time for iraqi forces to leave 
kuwait by the united nations deadline three days later 
that deadline is real bush said adding that iraqi forces 
must be totally out totally out by then 
on the financial markets meanwhile traders said the continued 
statemate of usiraqi talks drove oil prices up in trading today 
light sweet crude oil for january delivery was up 143 per barrel 
at 2785 early this afternoon on the new york mercantile exchange 
meanwhile pentagon officials said thousands more medical 
personnel were being dispatched to join the us deployment in 
saudi arabia 
bush made his comments on the white house lawn before boarding a 
helicopter for a weekend trip to the presidential retreat at camp 
david he said he has been considering seeking congressional 
support for offensive military action in the persian gulf if iraq 
doesnt withdraw from kuwait by the jan 15 deadline 
i think it would send a very strong signal to the world if 
congress explicity endorsed his persian gulf policy he said 
democratic critics have complained that bush was abandoning 
reliance on economic sanctions too early for them to have taken 
effect 
bush has said the sole purpose of bakers talks is not to 
negotiate a settlement but to issue a facetoface demand that 
saddam withdraw his troops 
since bush called for the talks saddam has permitted the 
release of hundreds of united state and other westerners held in 
kuwait and iraq since the crisis began on aug 2 and bush withdrew 
the small diplomatic team that had been holed up in the besieged us 
embassy in kuwait 
interest was now turning to the diplomatic front but bush said 
aziz planned visit to the united states to see bush is on hold 
i guess pending an agreement on the date baker will see saddam 
bush originally invited saddam to receive baker in iraq any time 
between dec 15 and jan 15 i wish now i had been a little more 
explicit in my first announcement he said 
i did not offer to be a part to saddam husseins 
manipulation bush said adding that the aziz meeting is on 
hold i guess pending agreement on a date for bakers trip 
earlier today white house spokesman marlin fitzwater addressed 
the subject of the stalemate 
the presidents concerned and hes upset that saddam can find 
time to meet with everybody else under the sun with 24 hours notice 
but somehow he cant find one out of 15 days to meet with baker 
he said 
bush met earlier in the day with lawmakers to discuss the 
persian gulf and two senators emerged to say the president was 
prepared to call off the talks with iraq because the two countries 
have been unable to agree on meeting dates 
the president as i gather his mood today is prepared to 
have no meetings rather than to see a lot of shoving around if 
we have no meetings so be it sen richard lugar rind said 
lugar is a member of the committee for peace and security in the 
gulf a bipartisan group formed to support the presidents gulf 
policy that met with bush this morning 
sen john mccain rariz another member of the group told 
reporters the president feels he has taken the necessary steps 
that encourages dialogue and if they fail to respond in a 
reasonable and mature fashion then hes made his best effort and 
thats it 
bush was intent that the purpose of the meetings was that saddam 
understand the strength and conviction of the international 
coalition arrayed against him since his aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
said lugar 
if he understands that already by watching television i 
think the president is prepared to let it go at that said lugar 
bush is tired of hearing peoples assumptions that there was 
some other agenda or negotiating intent to his proposal for talks 
with iraq 
if were not going to have any meetings it would clear that 
up for good lugar said 
joseph wilson iv the deputy us ambassador to iraq has talked 
daily to foreign ministry officials in baghdad about setting a date 
for bakers visit to baghdad but margaret d tutwiler the state 
department spokeswoman said thursday the iraqis had not offered an 
alternative to jan 12 
wilson met again thursday with deputy foreign minister nizar 
hamdoon and there is no substantive change in their position a 
us official who demanded anonymity said

a former top aide to savings and loan owner 
charles h keating jr testified today that sen donald riegle 
arranged a meeting between senators and the top federal thrift 
regulator to discuss keatings concerns riegle has denied setting 
up the meeting 
james grogan once corporate counsel to keatings parent 
company told the senate ethics committee that riegle suggested the 
meeting when he visited the arizona facilities of keatings 
american continental corp and met privately with keating 
grogan testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution 
the meeting on april 2 1987 was held by four senators with 
thentop regulator edwin j gray gray has charged that the 
senators improperly pressured him in that session to drop a 
regulatory control of lincoln savings and loan that keating was 
protesting 
riegle did not attend that meeting and grogan said he was 
surprised by the senators absence riegle did attend a meeting 
with the other four senators and san franciscobased regulators a 
week later grogan said he urged riegle to attend the second 
meeting and wanted to keep the team together referring to the 
senators 
grogan also testified that sen alan cranston dcalif agreed 
to call grays successor m danny wall to arrange a meeting 
between the regulator and keating in late 1987 grogan said keating 
made the request to keating after grogan delivered 250000 in 
checks for a voterregistration drive cranston was supporting and 
together they placed a call by speaker phone to keating in arizona 
grogan said riegle had suggested that the two arizona senators 
democrat dennis deconcini and republican john mccain attend the 
session with gray on april 2 he said riegle asked that the other 
senators then invite him to attend 
committee special counsel robert s bennett asked grogan is 
there any doubt in your mind senator riegle agreed to arrange the 
meeting for the senators 
grogan replied no sir 
grogan recalled that riegle said he would talk with ed gray 
and he thought he could set up a meeting and perhaps set up a 
process of disengaging from the feud or fighting that was going 
on between keating and the regulators 
riegle in earlier testimony before the committee in its keating 
five hearings denied setting up that meeting or one a week later 
with all five senators including himself and regulators 
no i didnt arrange either meeting riegle has testified 
grogan said that while riegle and keating met privately he met 
with kevin gotlieb riegles staffer on the senate banking 
committee and discussed a fundraiser keating was organizing for 
riegle in detroit keating owned a prominent downtown hotel there 
bennett asked grogan did senator riegle ever tell you why he 
wanted you to ask senator mccain to ask senator riegle to come to 
the meeting 
grogan replied it was apparent to me that senator riegle 
knew as a shrewd politician that this was a potentially politically 
explosive situation because there was tremendous media at the time 
about mr keating and mr gray and the regulators and all the 
fighting 
grogan said that when he asked mccain he refused to invite 
riegle but did agree to at least talk to riegle about it 
the panel granted grogan limited immunity from prosecution to 
compel his testimony about keatings ties to five senators who have 
been accused of intervening improperly with federal thrift 
regulators on behalf of keatings lincoln savings and loan 
association 
grogan 36 of scottsdale ariz gave his first public 
testimony with his lawyer sitting behind him none of the five 
senators under scrutiny was present 
grogan said he had earned 300000 a year working for keatings 
company before resigning last june he described his relations 
with keating as strained 
keating had extensive contacts with the senators and their 
staffs he was a big contributor to each lawmaker and the 
committee is considering whether the 13 million he and associates 
donated to their campaigns and related political causes was tied to 
their assistance 
keatings parent company american continental co went 
bankrupt in april 1989 and lincoln was seized by federal 
regulators the cost to taxpayers to cover insured deposits is 
expected to top 2 billion and keating is under a state fraud 
indictment in california 
grogan was vice president of lincoln based in irvine calif 
and corporate counsel to american continental based in phoenix 
the five senators are republican john mccain of arizona and 
democrats alan cranston of california dennis deconcini of arizona 
john glenn of ohio and donald riegle of michigan 
keating grogan and other aides invoked their fifth amendment 
rights against selfincrimination in refusing to testify in 
granting grogan immunity to compel his testimony the committee 
said it would not do so for keating 
evidence in the previous four weeks of public hearings has shown 
that grogan arranged for political donations to lawmakers and was 
point man in soliciting congressional help for keatings allout 
war with regulators who were closing in on lincoln 
a memo introduced into evidence last week showed that keating 
directed grogan to try to have a senior career regulator fired for 
his tough actions against lincoln

union workers overwhelming approved a 
new contract friday with delta pride catfish inc ending a bitter 
threemonth strike that brought out allegations of racial 
discrimination 
the plight of the workers in one of the nations most 
economically depressed regions attracted support from the naacp and 
other civil rights organizations and led to a national boycott of 
delta pride products 
the contract vote was 4791 union officials said the lone vote 
against appeared to be a misunderstanding over wage provisions in 
the pact 
this is a great christmas present said sarah white a shop 
steward who has been with delta pride since 1983 one year after 
the nations largest catfish processor opened i feel good about 
this contract and ive talked with several coworkers and they are 
satisfied 
we finally got some of the things we wanted including 
things that should make the workplace better for all of us 
the strike began sept 13 when members of united food and 
commercial workers union local 1529 rejected a contract about 900 
workers walked off the job at delta prides indianola and inverness 
plants a third plant in belzoni employs nonunion workers 
the company had no immediate comment on the contract vote 
provisions in the contract include wage increases and assurances 
that striking workers will be rehired union officials said 
the contract grants immediate raises of 60 to 65 cents an hour 
for all workers with at least one year of seniority pay averaged 
405 an hour before the strike the pact also establishes a 
workermanagement health and safety committee to monitor conditions 
at the plant 
while there were scattered reports of violence including 
rockthrowing early in the strike officials said recent weeks 
were quiet 
aaron henry president of the mississippi naacp said the 
workers anger arose from a combination of race and economics 
coupled with the philosophy of the plantation 
besides wages the union also raised concerns about working 
conditions a common complaint among workers has been about 
repetitive motion injury 
workers complained that they were timed with a stopwatch when 
skinning gutting slicing and packaging fish the also complained 
of limited restroom breaks six fiveminute bathroom breaks per 
week violators risked dismissal 
white who has two children said the three months she has been 
on strike created financial problems but the union helped take 
care of our bills and provided groceries for us we really 
sacrificed but we had help with the basics 
white 32 of moorhead said she planned to be in st louis this 
weekend to attend a support rally for the striking workers 
now i can tell them it is over and tell them to start buying 
catfish we need the hours at work she said 
e dale cline of memphis tenn the federal mediator who helped 
work out the new contract said he is tickled to death that this 
is finally over 
union spokesman neel lattimore said the contract goes a long way 
toward improving working conditions 
we feel like there is language in the contract to make delta 
pride more sensitive to working conditions and by all of us 
working together we can get along he said

germany said friday it will summon the 
soviet ambassador to explain why moscow has not handed over ousted 
east german communist leader erich honecker for trial 
berlin state justice authorities issued an arrest warrant on 
nov 30 for honecker accusing him of signing shoottokill orders 
that resulted in the deaths of wouldbe escapees from east germany 
on thursday they asked for bonns help in persuading the soviet 
union to turn him over federal government spokesman dieter vogel 
said friday 
the soviets say they have admitted honecker to a soviet military 
hospital in beelitz outside berlin for humanitarian reasons 
honeckers lawyers claim he is seriously ill and under treatment 
for high blood pressure 
the soviets sheltering of honecker 78 who was toppled in 
1989s peaceful revolution in east germany is complicating bonns 
relations with moscow in recent months the two governments have 
drawn closer together through moscows blessing of german unity and 
german promises of huge financial aid for the soviets 
vogel said that in a short time the foreign ministry will 
invite the soviet ambassador in bonn for talks abot honecker 
under german law the prosecution of honecker is not a federal 
matter but one for justice officials in berlin whose eastern half 
was east germanys seat of government 
on thursday sources said bonn may try to persuade soviet 
authorities to let a german doctor into the soviet military 
hospital to examine honecker and determine whether he is fit to 
stand trial 
also friday the berlin state court said it has rejected a 
challenge of the arrest warrant by honeckers lawyers the lawyers 
argued that honecker could not be penalized for following the law 
of former east germany 
the court did not say on what grounds it had dismissed the 
appeal under german law former east germans can be prosecuted for 
crimes committed in eastern germany before unification in october 
the defense lawyers said they would take the matter to germanys 
supreme court 
about 200 east germans were gunned down while trying to escape 
to the west in the years following the 1961 construction of the 
berlin wall 
honecker came to power in 1971

mourners remembered human rights activist andrei 
d sakharov on friday a year after his death as an extraordinary 
moral force whose place in politics and in their hearts has yet to 
be matched by anyone else 
i cant see anybody now whose ideas i could agree with he was 
a man whose thoughts could find a response in peoples souls 
said bela kleshchenko an activist standing beside sakharovs grave 
at a snowy cemetery in southwest moscow 
i cant see anybody today who could take his place said 
67yearold pensioner baruch froyimovich tearyeyed as he looked 
at the grave you need a man who has very high culture heart 
soul and brains he was man of the highest culture 
sakharov was a top soviet physicist who helped develop the 
hydrogen bomb in the 1950s and later won the 1975 nobel peace prize 
for his campaigns on behalf of disarmament and human rights 
he died a year ago at age 68 after three vigorous years of 
political activism following his emergence from forced internal 
exile 
controversial for much of his political life sakharov has 
gained steadily in public esteem since his death groups scramble 
to attach his name to their cause and his words are quoted by 
politicians and commentators alike as the country deals with 
worsening political and economic crises 
in 1980 sakharov was denounced in the official press as an 
utterly ignorant person and exiled to the closed city of gorky 
for criticizing the soviet invasion of afghanistan 
president mikhail s gorbachev released him in december 1986 
and he returned to moscow where he became an outspoken deputy in 
the supreme soviet parliament 
russian federation president boris yeltsin opened fridays 
session of the russian parliament with a tribute to sakharov and 
national newspapers published articles praising him 
the government plans to make a museum out of his old apartment 
in gorky which has since been renamed nizhninovgorod 
but at the cemetery ms kleshchenko said politicians were 
cashing in on sakharovs name without fulfilling his ideals 
the powers that be brought about his death and now they 
are preparing to establish a museum in his honor said ms 
kleshchenko a member of the sakharov order of charity and social 
defense 
our politicians are too busy with politics and they dont 
really have any human qualities she said what was so special 
about sakharov was that he was a scholar a politician and a man 
he was still human 
at the huge cemetery the rumble of trucks on a nearby highway 
was barely audible next to sakharovs grave which was covered by a 
blanket of evergreen twigs and carnations of all colors 
a blackandwhite portrait of the physicist hung from the 
headstone flanked by evergreen wreaths that bore sashes from the 
russian parliament and democratic activists a halfdozen candles 
flickered in the subfreezing breeze in front of the grave 
pairs of policemen stood at each corner of a path leading to the 
gravesite apparently on guard in case of any demonstrations but 
the mood was solemn and people spoke softly or not at all 
at the parliament sergei kovalev a deputy and close friend 
said sakharov was intrepid and unselfish in the quest of truth 
he was always outside the turmoil of political passions and 
ambitions he took interest in nothing but the truth 
the moscow newspaper leninskoye znamiya said history has 
already had its say on sakharov he belongs to it at the same 
time he is near us he stayed in the hearts of all who wanted to 
have him

here is a text of president bushs 
questionandanswer session on the white house lawn friday 
bush i have two brief statements that id like to make this 
afternoon and first i have today asked a distinguished public 
servant and a cherished friend to become secretary of the 
department of labor lynn martin a former congresswoman from 
illinois has agreed to assume the direction of this very important 
cabinet office 
she and i have known each other for many years she was an 
outstanding member of congress and an unofficial adviser to me she 
has shared with me her wisdom on any number of legislative issues 
and i am delighted to have her working at my side on labor matters 
as we enter the decade of the 90s 
shes a mother who knows the need for child care shes a 
professional who understands the businesslabor relationship and 
as a congresswoman she spent years dealing with the concerns and 
aspirations of the working americans from every walk of life and i 
know that she will serve with great distinction in our cabinet 
lynn was in illinois this afternoon when i called her and she 
will be in washington on monday and i look forward to meeting her 
here in the white house to talk about the direction of the 
department of labor 
and now id like to take up another subject a second one on 
nov 30 in offering direct meetings between the united states and 
iraq i offered to go the extra mile for a peaceful solution to the 
gulf question and i wanted to make clear to saddam hussein the 
absolute determination of the coalition that he comply fully with 
the security council resolutions 
iraqi aggression cannot be rewarded and so i have asked the 
secretary of sate to be available to go to baghdad any time up to 
and including jan 3 which is over five months after the invasion 
of kuwait and only 12 days before the united nations deadline for 
withdrawal 
that deadline is real to show flexibility i have offered any 
one of 15 dates for secretary baker to go to baghdad and the 
iraqis have offered only one date in offering to go the extra mile 
for peace however i did not offer to be a party to saddam 
husseins manipulation saddam hussein is not too busy to see on 
short notice kurt waldheim willy brandt muhammad ali ted heath 
john connally ramsey clark and many many others on very short 
notice 
and it simply is not credible that he cannot over a twoweek 
period make a couple of hours available for the secretary of state 
on an issue of this importance unless of course he is seeking to 
circumvent the united nations deadline 
look i want a peaceful solution to this crisis but i will not 
be a party to circumventing or diluting the united nations 
deadline which i think offers the very best chance for a peaceful 
solution and so i wanted to get out my feeling about these 
proposed meetings 
q mr president whats wrong with the jan 12 date that he 
set why would that dilute it unless youre afraid that he might 
come up with some offer 
a well in the first place the united nations resolutions that 
pertain say that he has to be out of kuwait i wish now that i had 
been a little more explicit in my first announcement on what i 
meant by mutually convenient dates but i was not then but now 
and am not now prepared to have this man manipulate the purpose 
of the secretary of states visit 
so we will we have made an offer of many many dates but 
remember the united nations resolution calls for total withdrawal 
by this date 
q and does your statement today indicate that you would not 
accept jan 5 or 6 
a weve offered 15 days and he ought to get moving and do 
something reasonable if he really wants to move for peace 
q mr president is there a date at which you would withdraw 
the offer to meet the senators this morning say youre willing to 
forgo talks now 
a well were not going to do them on terms that are would 
appear to the world to be an effort to circumvent the united 
nations resolution i mean hes got a massive force there and 
that force has to be out on the 15th of january under the united 
nations resolutions so well see how it goes 
i would say that weve given so many alternatives here that he 
ought to stay with accept one of these if hes serious now if 
its simply that he is trying to manipulate that is what i will 
have no part of 
q is there a deadline for him to accept your offer 
a no were not putting down deadlines on it the aziz meeting 
is on hold i guess i mean i say i guess because weve made 
clear to them that its kind of a homeandhome arrangement here 
q youve said the deadline is real so that means you think you 
have carte blanche to start a war after jan 15 or on jan 15 
a im saying that the united nations resolution is very clear 
as it regards jan 15 and i will continue now to work for a 
peaceful solution

friedrich duerrenmatt the swiss 
writer whose plays display a sardonic mix of realism and absurd 
visions died friday of heart failure he was 69 
the author of the visit and the physicists died at his 
home in the lakeside town of neuchatel in western switzerland the 
diogenes publishing house announced it was three weeks before his 
70th birthday 
duerrenmatts collected works comprise more than 30 volumes and 
have been translated from the german into over 50 languages he is 
believed to have been the most widely played contemporary dramatist 
since bertolt brecht 
besides plays duerrenmatt also wrote novels essays and his 
convoluted stoffe or materials which blend fiction with 
autobiographical notes his worldwide reputation was established by 
the visit which premiered in 1955 in the play an entire town 
slowly yields to the temptation of murdering one of its citizens 
for the sake of a promised fortune 
in another popular play the physicists first performed in 
1961 the main characters escape nuclear age realities in a 
madhouse 
his novels included justice which has a complicated murder 
plot his paintings also won considerable attention at several 
exhibitions 
duerrenmatts last play was titled achterloo a farcical 
theateroftheabsurd parable inspired by the martial law clampdown 
on polands solidarity movement it premiered in 1983 
he said the play tried to show that the modern world is 
changing into a theaterthe consequences will be disastrous 
the son of a protestant pastor duerrenmatt was born jan 5

originally he wanted to become a painter and also studied 
theology philosophy literature and natural sciences 
his first success as writer came in 1949 with romulus the 
great which he called an unhistorical historical comedy 
about the fall of the roman empire 
gloom mingled typically with impish irony and jocular paradoxes 
in duerrenmatts parabletype plays which he preferred to call 
comedies despite their tragic quality 
tragedy he once observed could no longer be written because 
the modern world lacking established standards of guilt and 
retribution was not suited for it 
the world he said stands as an enigma of calamity that has 
to be accepted but to which there must be no surrender 
several plays were turned into movies including the visit 
starring ingrid bergman and anthony quinn 
deurrenmatt suffered from a heart condition for more than 20 
years and was a diabetic funeral arrangements were not immediately

a nonsmoking waiter has received a settlement ina workers 
compensation case in which he claimed his heart attack was caused 
by exposure to other peoples cigarette smoke his attorney said 
friday 
theyve admitted that our claim is substantial enough that if 
they went to trial theyd probably lose said the attorney 
charles crane 
in the settlement the california compensation insurance fund 
agreed to take care of the 54yearold waiters medical bills 
which amount to about 85000 
stanton glantz a researcher who testified in the case as an 
authority on passive smoking said he believed it was the first 
time a workers compensation decision was based on passive 
smokinginduced heart disease 
and this was successful said glantz of the university of 
california san francisco 
he is coauthor of a study that shows that secondhand cigarette 
smoke causes 32000 heart disease deaths per year in the united 
states 
the settlement of the case could have important ramifications 
for employers crane said 
basically what this says is that employers who have to pay for 
workers compensation insurance better make sure their employees 
are not breathing in stuff they shouldnt be breathing in crane 
said 
jolinda thompson general counsel with the california 
restaurant association said she had not yet reviewed the case so 
she did not know how it might affect restaurant owners 
maybe this is a very special case she said maybe its 
not 
michael mowrey the attorney who represented the state 
compensation insurance fund did not return two phone calls to his 
office 
the waiter avtar uhbi did not smoke had no family history of 
heart disease ate a mostly vegetarian diet and otherwise had 
little risk or heart disease crane said 
yet he suffered a heart attack on march 14 1989 which led to 
complications and 15 days in the hospital 
there are just no environmental or hereditary factors other 
than what we found in his workplace crane said this place was 
your real smoky bar 
uhbi said he worked at the combination bar and restaurant in 
sausalito just north of san francisco for five years he has 
since left to open his own restaurant down the road 
new years we are putting in a no smoking sign he said

president bush kept mum friday on his new 
search for a republican party chairman as conservatives betting 
they wont like his pick said turmoil within the gop makes it more 
likely bush will face a 1992 challenge from the right 
bush headed to camp david for the weekend still having said 
nothing publicly about william bennetts abrupt decision not to 
take over the republican national committee or his new search to 
fill the gops leadership vacuum 
party officials and gop analysts predicted bush would act 
quickly to fill the vacancy 
the name of former texas congressman tom loeffler figured 
prominently in the speculation with some party officials saying he 
appeared to be the early favorite 
at the white house one source said loeffler was in the running 
but that there was no frontrunner another white house source said 
bluntly that loeffler is history indicating a fight may be 
brewing within the administration over the vacancy and whether bush 
needed a highprofile chairman to put the bennett embarrassment 
behind him 
tom is on the list but a lot of people are on the list 
said the first source both of whom spoke on the condition of 
anonymity the president has not given a nod or a wink or a 
whisper about his thinking 
others mentioned in speculation included longtime republican 
operative and bush loyalist rich bond housing secretary jack kemp 
transportation secretary samuel skinner and several congressional 
republicans who lost 1990 elections or are retiring among them 
retiring sen william armstrong of colorado surfaced as a favorite 
of conservatives including administration aides 
bush filled one administration vacancy nominating rep lynn 
martin of illinois as labor secretary before heading to camp 
david for the weekend the vacancy at the rnc did not come up 
during a brief bush meeting with reporters 
an administration official said the list was in no order other 
than alphabetical 
with the rnc annual meeting a month away and bush facing 
increasing criticism even within his party there was little doubt 
he would pick a chairman soon 
the way the bennett thing was handled it looks like they 
waffled back and forth said lyn nofziger who ran the political 
operation in the reagan white house they seemed to have handled 
it the same way they handled the tax thing going back and forth i 
think he ought to do this pretty quickly and get it behind him 
said another party official with ties to the white house 
theyll be burning a little oil at camp david to get this done 
a loeffler associate said the former fourterm congressman had 
a good exchange of views about the job during a telephone 
conversation thursday with presidential chief of staff john sununu 
but the administration official said sununu had spoken to others as 
well 
loeffler 44 was a rising star in the gop leadership when he 
left the house where he was known for his political skill and had 
a conservative voting record including votes in favor of school 
prayer and limits on abortions 
armstrong also is a staunch antiabortion conservative 
bond who did not return a telephone message was said to be 
actively pursuing the position as well and getting support from 
some in the party who favor a campaign strategist for chairman 
another strategist whose name surfaced was spence abraham the 
michigan gop chairman 
bush decided in november to replace the ailing lee atwater as 
chairman of the republican national committee and selected bennett 
not long after he resigned as presidential drug policy chief but 
bennett said thursday that he would not take the job because of a 
white house ruling severely limiting his options to make outside 
income 
that dramatic decision left conservatives suspicious of bushs 
motives for selecting bennett but happy nonetheless to have an ally 
with access to the president renewing talk of mounting a longshot 
bid to wrest the 1992 nomination from the incumbent president 
conservatives are so disillusioned with bush that anybody he 
picks is really not going to be much of a help to him said gop 
activist richard viguerie echoing comments of several 
conservatives many conservatives in the country are saying its 
time to get off the bus turn it over and set it on fire the bus 
driver has serious problems 
but nofziger said the conservative criticism was unlikely to 
mushroom into a serious threat to bush 
there are an awful lot of conservatives who would rather go 
fight somebody than run something nofziger said im one of 
them at heart but it just doesnt make sense i dont see anyway 
that anyone is going to mount a significant challenge

q well you do think you can go to war after that is that 
right 
a what do you mean can go to war 
q you can start a war 
a i think that the united nations resolutions should be fully 
implemented 
q mr president when congress comes back in january will you 
ask congress for specific authority to take offensive action 
a i were talking about that and im very pleased with the 
support weve had in congress and im very pleased with the level 
of support from the american people you see as these hostages 
have come home i think the people have understood much more 
clealy whats at stake as theyve seen the testimony about the 
brutality to the kuwaiti people that was so compelling at the 
united nations i think people have said wait a minute this 
policy deserves support 
so i am pleased with the support i think thats being manifested 
in more support by the congress but i will be talking to the 
leaders continuing to consult 
and what i told the leaders in the cabinet room a few weeks ago 
if you want to come in here and strongly endorse what i am doing or 
endorse the united nations resolution i welcome that because i 
think it would send a very strong clear signal to the world 
q well sir why are you afraid to go before congress and 
consult with them and get their advice and get their approval 
a hey listen sarah i was consulting with them as recently as 
this morning five members of congress and we will continue to 
consult with them 
q thats not 535 members of the house and senate 
a were doing it all the time im on the phone almost every 
day to them weve had leadership meeting after leadership meeting 
oh listen i explained this to you in the press room a while back 
this same question come on 
q but you should see my mail 
a you ought to see mine 
q are you saying if saddam hussein wont meet by jan 3 there 
simply will be no meeting 
a im saying that he weve given him 15 dates and he ought to 
take one of them i dont like to draw deadlines in the sand here 
but i thered have to be some compelling reason for me to change 
it because i dont want to move this up against the united nations 
deadline if youll read the un resolutions youll see that he 
should be totally out totally out of kuwait by jan 15 thats a 
massive undertaking 
q mr president if i may follow up are you saying that you 
may meet jan 4 or 5 
q im not saying that youre saying that ive put it as 
clearly as i can i hope theres no obfuscation 
q mr president what is your thinking today about saddam 
husseins nuclear and chemical capabilities 
a i am very much concerned about it i think that congress and 
the american people are getting increasingly concerned about his 
its not just nuclear which concerns me but its other 
unconventional war capabilities im talking about for example in 
this context chemical weapons that he has used on his own people 
already 
so yes i am very concerned about it and any arrangement that 
is going to keep the rest of the world happy will have to address 
itself to these this unconventional war capability of saddam 
hussein anybody that will take the reckless action he has taken 
militarily against a neighbor must be contained in this era when 
were all concerned about nuclear proliferation 
so im glad you brought it up because this morning i met with a 
group of people who are supportive of our policy and they are 
emphasizing to me as they go across the country the concern by 
the american people on the part of the american people about 
his possession of these unconventional weapons and his desire to 
acquire nuclear weapons 
and i told i believe that it was a press conference with most 
of you present i said if ive got to err on the side of how long 
i addressed myself to the question how long does he will it 
take for him to get weapons i will err on the cautious side on 
the conservative side and i am concerned that he could acquire 
weapons in a very short period of time a weapon in a very short 
period of time and that is a factor that is serious as i 
contemplate how he is compelled to live up to the united nations 
resolution 
q mr president do you support the department of education 
regulations barring racebased scholarships or do you plan to 
rescind them 
a were looking at it right now the man that had something to 
do with them i was looking at his background today is an 
extraordinarily sensitive very intelligent person so ive asked 
our staff here to give me a quick readout on that so we can make a 
determination but i dont think in this case anybody would accuse 
the person that promulgated those resolutions of doing it on a 
racist basis thats one thing im very pleased about 
ive got time for one more and then i really do have to go 
q mr president right now the issue of chemical possession 
of weapons and nuclear weapons is not part of the united nations 
resolutions will you go back to the un and get that made part of 
one of the requirements for saddam hussein or will you move on that 
unilaterally 
a well i dont think its unilateral because i think all our 
coalition partners share my concerns about his possession of 
unconventional weapons and his attempt to get more but i dont 
have plans at this moment to take this to the united nations but 
believe me it is very much in my thinking as i contemplate what 
action to take to enforce the united nations resolutions 
thank you all and have a great weekend

the average income of physicians increased about 
11000 to more than 155000 in 1989 according to a study by the 
american medical association 
the 77 percent increase outstripped the rate of inflation as 
measured by the consumer price index which increased 46 percent 
in 1989 
the presidentelect of the ama the nations largest 
organization of doctors said friday he could see public concern 
about the increase but he didnt think doctors as a group are 
overpaid or underpaid 
i would expect the average persons reaction to be surprise 
but when you think about the number of hours a doctor works in a 
week and some of the training the intensity of some of the work 
in some of the specialties i think its understandable said dr 
john j ring 
ring a family physician in suburban mundelein noted that the 
increase in 1989 the last year in which the figures were 
available was actually smaller than most years since 1981 
average physician income nationally was 155800 in 1989 up 
from the 1988 average of 144700 the ama said 
the median physician income the statistical midpoint between 
the highest and lowest salaries was 125000 in 1989 up from 
120000 in 1988 the ama says it prefers the median figure because 
higher paid doctors tend to raise the average making it a poor 
measure of typical earnings 
the figures are from the chicagobased amas socioeconomic 
monitoring system report which surveyed 4000 doctors the figures 
represent income before taxes but after all professional expenses 
in 1981 the first year of the survey the average was 89900 
family physicians earned the least an average of 95900 in 
1989 compared with 94600 in 1988 
surgeons earned the most among specialists a 1989 average of 
220500 compared with 207500 in 1988 
charles inlander president of the peoples medical society a 
consumer interest group in suburban philadelphia called the 
figures another example of how doctors gouge the public 
it is immoral for doctors to have this kind of income when 15 
percent of the population has no healthcare insurance he said 
a survey conducted last year for the ama found that twothirds 
of americans think doctors are too interested in making money 
but the salary survey can be misleading said one central 
illinois family physician with a solo practice 
some kinds of doctors are overpaid some are not paid what 
theyre worth said dr george savvas of champaign general 
practitioners in champaign make closer to 75000 than 95000 
savvas said 
its not very easy money i get myself up at 5 oclock in the 
morning and i go home at night and most of the time i dont even 
get a break savvas said 
there is also the cost of malpractice insurance and difficulties 
getting paid through the medicare system savvas said primary care 
doctors often lose their medicare payments to specialists they have 
referred their patients to he said 
insurers have long paid high fees for technical procedures and 
operations and much less for the hours that primary care doctors 
spend figuring out which treatments their patients need but 
beginning in 1992 medicare will reimburse doctors more for their 
time managing and evaluating patients and less for technical 
services and operations 
here are some other average 1989 incomes for specialties other 
than surgeons according to the ama survey 
internal medicine 146500 
pediatrics 104700 
obstetricsgynecology 194300 
radiology 210500 
psychiatry 111700 
anesthesiologist 185800 
pathologist 154500

an ethnic albanian leader said 
friday changes in neighboring albania would bolster efforts for 
autonomy in yugoslavias troubled kosovo province 
the victory of democracy in albania would represent great 
support and encouragement for the struggle of albanian people in 
yugoslavia said dr fehmi agani leader of the democratic union 
of kovoso 
the first noncommunist political party was formed in albania 
this week there also have been reports of street violence despite 
a string of concessions by authorities in europes last stalinist 
nation 
agani said his group was concerned about reports of clashes in 
albania but we believe that there is enough wisdom strength 
and resolution in albania to safeguard a peaceful accelerated 
democratic transformation of the country 
ethnic albanians comprise about 90 percent of the 19 million 
people in kosovo a yugoslav province now tightly controlled by the 
serbian republic 
last sunday most ethnic albanians boycotted the first free 
elections in more than 50 years in serbia 
after the kosovo parliament proclaimed sovereignty this summer 
the serbian government dismissed legislators and shut down all 
influential albanianlanguage media in the province 
serbia sees the region as its historic homeland and refuses to 
grant kosovo greater independence serbian authorities charge that 
albanians are seeking to secede and join albania 
leading ethnic albanian dissident author rexhep qosja said in a 
telephone interview that it is natural for albanians to live 
together 
why would the people of kosovo be an exception qosja asked 
i believe that serbia will one day rather negotiate with albania 
about kosovo than to allow the province to become a republic 
there is no turning back in albania and the democracy will win 
there he said

the army said friday it has canceled plans to 
build a new airdefense missile under development by boeing 
aerospace and electronics co and hughes aircraft co 
the estimated cost of fully developing of the weapon called the 
nonline of sight missile has tripled over the past two years to 
nearly 400 million the army said in explaining why it decided to 
end the project after spending 131 million 
the missile was being designed with a fiberoptic guidance 
system that would enable army gunners to use it against helicopters 
and armored vehicles hidden by ground cover the missiles launcher 
and fire control station were to be mounted on a humvee the 
allpurpose vehicle that replaced the army jeep 
the proposed missile was part of the armys plan for an 
integrated airdefense system for frontline combat operations the 
plan still in effect includes the airtoair stinger missile 
deployed on helicopters improved tank ammunition for air defense 
and an improved command and control system

saddam hussein take notice squid swimming off the 
shores of cape cod have a secret weapon against nerve gas 
an enzyme within squid nerve cells breaks down nerve gas and has 
the attention of military researchers who are trying to find 
practical uses for it on the battlefield 
when you know that some people have chemical weapons you need 
to know how to get rid of them said shirley tove of the army 
research office in research triangle park nc 
the us military has had more reason lately to fear nerve gas 
as troops face the threat of iraqi chemical weapons in the persian 
gulf 
the squid nerve gas defense was discovered by francis hoskin 
who has spent his summers collecting squid at the marine biological 
laboratory in woods hole 
more than two decades ago hoskin applied nerve poison to a 
squid nerve and was astonished when the nerve kept functioning 
what was happening was most of the nerve gas solution was 
being detoxified or chewed up by the enzyme he said in a 
recent interview 
hoskin a research professor of biology at the illinois 
institute of technology in chicago continued studying the enzyme 
the defense department has helped fund hoskins research through 
much of the past decade tove said 
scientists envision attaching the enzyme to fabric thus 
enabling the army to create protective uniforms another 
possibility is enzymeladen soap which could be used to wash the 
chemicals off the skin or equipment 
such applications however probably will not be seen for years 
tove said first of all scientists must develop ways to clone the 
enzyme since each squid produces only a microscopic amount of the 
substance 
and the army is not banking completely on squid a similar 
enzyme produced by soil bacteria also is being studied tove said 
hoskin said military officials have been asking him more 
questions about his work since iraq invaded kuwait in august 
but hoskin who was a pilot in world war ii and describes 
himself as not the worlds greatest pacifist says that for now 
hes more interested in pure science than military strategy 
why should a squid that has been evolving for almost 1 billion 
years why should it have an enzyme to deal with a compound that 
was only synthesized in the 1920s hoskin asked

palestinians stabbed three jews to death in 
an aluminum factory friday and sprayed moslem fundamentalist 
slogans on the walls before fleeing police said the killings set 
off antiarab riots and cries for vengeance 
the latest in a string of knife attacks on jewish civilians also 
brought demands from israeli rightwingers for a crackdown on 
palestinians 
police minister roni milo promised unprecedented measures 
and said he had decided to support use of the death penalty 
capital punishment exists on israeli military law books but is 
never imposed 
he said he would limit the hours per day that arabs from the 
occupied territories can stay in israel 
rightwing politicians including members of the governing 
coalition demanded the deportation of 1000 leaders of the 
antiisraeli uprising and the dismissal of the more than 100000 
arabs who live in the occupied lands but work in israel 
moderate israelis blamed fridays killings on the failure of 
arabisraeli peace moves 
the slayings in the mixed arabjewish town of jaffa adjacent to 
tel aviv brought jewish mobs onto the streets stoning cars 
assaulting arab passersby and clamoring for revenge 
police said the attack was thought to be the work of an arab 
from the occupied gaza strip who works at the factory and one 
accomplice both were still being sought they said 
the attackers apparently waited outside the alum shin plant 
until two jewish employees arrived and escorted them in they then 
stabbed iris asraf a 22yearold secretary metal cutter moshe 
awan 40 and yehoshua hakmaz 30 an upholsterer working next door 
who ran to help after hearing screams police said 
the bodies were found at about 830 am when another secretary 
arrived found knives and pools of blood on the floor and called 
for help police said 
an unidentified witness told israel radio he saw one man lying 
on the steps folded like a bag the knives were thrown near 
the body long knives with wide blades real commando knives 
police said slogans in black paint on the walls claimed 
responsibility on behalf of hamas or zeal an islamic 
fundamentalist underground group 
hamas which marked the third anniversary of its foundation 
friday had called on palestinians to mark the date by escalating 
their uprising against israel 
police commissioner yaacov terner rushed to the scene and said 
the sole reason for this murder is nationalism the slogans 
written in arabic on the walls inside are clear 
hamas did it they did it for the purpose of killing to mark 
the hamas anniversary he said 
there were shouts of death to arabs and terner go home 
from jews accusing police of not doing enough to protect israelis 
and angry people gathered near murder victim hakmazs house in 
neighboring bat yam 
i feel great pain that every day jews die in every corner of 
the country now it came to us im afraid to let my wife go out 
at night i have to get downstairs and accompany them one 
man said on israel radio 
paramilitary border police poured into jaffa to reinforce police 
coping with crowds of angry jews the rioters torched a car with a 
gaza license plate and besieged a coffee shop where an arab had 
taken refuge behind the police 
lets do to them what they do to us bellowed one man if 
we arent safe among them they shouldnt be safe among us 
police said three arab cars were damaged one arab was slightly 
injured by a knife and three jews were arrested 
prime minister yitzhak shamir returning from talks with 
president bush in washington said he would consult colleagues 
about the killings but added he was sensitive to us appeals for 
restraint 
asked about reports that israel was planning to deport 12 
uprising leaders and that washington had urged him not to do it 
shamir said nothing explicit was said to me about canceling 
any particular measure 
but shamir added he found sensitivity in the 
administration to drastic measures against palestinian rioters 
and disturbers of the peace 
asked if this would influence his actions shamir replied that 
of course we are sensitive to this sensibility 
fridays deaths raised to 57 the number of israelis killed by 
palestinians in the threeyear revolt in the occupied west bank and 
the gaza strip in the last attack on dec 2 three west bank arabs 
boarded a bus in tel aviv stabbed a jew to death and wounded three 
others 
the recent wave of attacks followed the temple mount riot in 
which 17 palestinians were shot and killed by israeli police 
in another announcement friday police minister milo said he 
will prohibit jewish extremists from celebrating the jewish holiday 
of hanukkah at the site next week 
at least 778 arabs have been killed by israeli troops or 
civilians in the uprising palestinians have murdered 317 fellow 
arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with israel

president mikhail s gorbachev acted on friday to 
try to restore order to the chaotic soviet economy nullifying 
decisions by the republics and local authorities that have 
disrupted food supplies 
he also decreed that government enterprises must carry out all 
contracts through the rest of this year and the first quarter of 
1991 to ensure a steady flow of supplies 
his move represented a crackdown on those regions that have 
broken the discipline that for years has guided the soviet unions 
command economy 
parliament has pressured gorbachev to improve food supplies 
particularly in moscow and leningrad where state stores have 
little milk sugar eggs butter cheese and meat some rightwing 
lawmakers demand a state of emergency 
moscow city officials accuse surrounding regions that usually 
supply the capital with food of reneging on contracts and stopping 
deliveries 
gorbachevs presidential decree on combatting disorganization 
of the soviet economy was read friday night on soviet television 
in it gorbachev complained that government economic decisions 
have not been carried out 
he declared null and void all economic decisions by local and 
republic bodies which undermine normal trade he also ordered 
local and republic officials to reverse decisions to stop supplying 
russian regions and moscow 
the decree ordered the government to apply tough sanctions on 
exporters who fail to secure proper licenses and contracts to sell 
raw materials and other goods abroad this appeared aimed at 
preventing any of the 15 republics from signing contracts with 
foreign firms to export resources without central government 
consent 
earlier friday presidential economic adviser stanislav shatalin 
blamed food shortages entirely to distribution problems and 
economic disarray he urged that emergency steps be taken without 
specifying what he had in mind 
soviet ports and borders have been swamped by shipments more 
than 16 million metric tons of imported goods were waiting to be 
unloaded or transported from ports and about 7000 railways cars 
were waiting at border stations 
the government says deliveries of most products are running 15 
percent to 44 percent below 1989 levels mostly due to theft and 
profiteering 
hunger is not an issue theres enough food shatalin said 
in an interview the issue is how to find it and distribute it so 
that it doesnt get into the hands of the mafia sabateours and 
corrupted elements 
shatalin had spearheaded a radical economic reform plan at the 
center of recent political battles 
black marketeers have pilfered state supplies heavyhanded 
economic control makes it more profitable for farmers to sell their 
products through unofficial channels 
fridays moskovskaya pravda reported that the kgb secret police 
searching moscow warehouses for hidden food found in one shop 
nearly two metric tons of meat 750 cans of instant coffee and 880 
pounds of butter one moscow fish distribution enterprise had 193 
metric tons of black caviar whose date of sale had already expired 
the newspaper said 
shatalin said efforts at economic and political change are 
linked beyond recall with the food problem but in the course of 
working out reforms there were things we didnt know how to do 
and couldnt do and a difficult situation emerged and these have 
to be resolved by emergency measures he said 
foreign countries continued to send the soviet union tons of 
humanitarian aid at a summit meeting in rome the european 
community on friday approved a 1 billion emergency aid package to 
help the soviet economy and support gorbachev 
about 1700 metric tons and 800 tons of medicine and other 
supplies have arrived with most going to hospitals and childrens 
homes officials said 
the aid also is meant to bolster gorbachev who has been 
attacked by hardliners and radicals during the nations economic 
and political turmoil 
gorbachev ordered the kgb and other law enforcement bodies to 
halt pilfering and government commissions have been formed to 
monitor the problem and direct the distribution of food workers 
committees and other informal groups also are tracking food on the 
way to its destination shatalin said 
but the heart of the problem remains land ownership and the 
chance to produce food profitably he said individuals must be 
given farmland from the stateowned farms and from collective farms 
that now can reserve only some of their produce for private use 
individual soviets already have the right to own tiny plots of 
land which alone account for an estimated 30 percent of the 
countrys food sold through highpriced private markets 
shatalin last autumn championed radical economic reforms that 
among other things would allow private property ownership but 
gorbachev rejected the plan in october in favor of a conservative 
compromise 
the move precipitated a split with boris yeltsin president of 
the russian republic who pushed ahead with the radical plan on 
russian territory russia and other republics began issuing orders 
that conflicted with gorbachevs decrees causing a paralysis of 
power that has contributed to the food problem 
kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov in a nationally televised 
address tuesday also accused unidentified foreign powers of 
supporting soviet radicals who were in turn exploiting spot food 
shortages

philadelphia missed a selfimposed deadline 
friday for solving its cash crunch but the city treasurer said he 
expected a deal to be ready by next week 
several parties interested in lending money have declined to 
commit themselves pending resolution of such issues as fiscal 
reform and who gets repaid first city treasurer benjamin blakney 
said 
the city intends to sell about 300 million in shortterm notes 
to banks two pension boards and the investment firm merrill lynch 
to avoid going broke before major tax payments come due in february 
and march 
a 375 million note issue collapsed in september amid worries 
about the citys fiscal condition bondrating agencies have 
dropped philadelphias credit rating this year to junkbond levels 
the lowest among major us cities 
unless it receives a cash infusion the city has warned it will 
not be able to meet payroll as early as dec 28 for city workers 
finance director elizabeth c reveal in a letter monday set 
deadlines of friday for commitments to buy notes and next wednesday 
for closing the deal 
there are open issues which clearly are still being looked at 
and quite frankly are still being discussed blakney said we 
will continue as expeditiously as possible to resolve those 
issues 
he said interest rates were less of a stumbling block than 
structural aspects of the transaction while declining to go into 
details he said major unresolved issues included fiscal reform and 
whether all note holders would be repaid simultaneously 
representatives from a consortium of banks met privately with 
gov robert p casey on thursday and mayor w wilson goode on 
riday the banks reportedly have sought a fiscal control board 
doubledigit interest rates and assurances they would be repaid 
before other note buyers 
goode described his meeting with the bankers as very 
constructive said his press secretary karen warrington 
the mayor feels theyre continuing to make progress and the 
parties are working to pull together a package that could avoid a 
missed payroll she said 
members of the city pension board and the state teachers pension 
fund met but did not vote on any proposals related to the note 
sale 
the city board of pensions and retirement is awaiting a report 
from ian lanoff a washington pensionlaw expert who was hired to 
advise them on the note transaction 
blakney said lanoff was finetuning some of the salient 
details of a response to the citys proposal 
similar responses were being drafted by the banks merrill lynch 
and consultants to the state public school employees retirement 
board he said 
goode and other democratic leaders have urged higher taxes 
spending cuts longterm deficit financing and other steps to stem 
the red ink action on those steps is not expected until the state 
legislature reconvenes early next year

myrlie evers the widow of slain civil 
rights leader medgar evers testified for an hour friday before a 
grand jury investigating her husbands 1963 assassination 
im filled with a little apprehension a lot of hope and 
faith evers said as she left the hinds county courthouse where 
the grand jury met amid speculation it may issue a new indictment 
in the 27yearold case 
the panel thursday summoned a former police detective who 
investigated the slaying scene at evers jackson home grand jurors 
also examined the rifle used to kill evers 
byron de la beckwith 70 a white supremacist from signal 
mountain tenn has said he is the target of the grand jury 
investigation he has also said he is innocent 
beckwith was arrested after the slaying but two 1964 trials 
ended with allwhite juries deadlocked on verdicts the original 
murder indictment was dismissed in 1969 
beckwith was a greenwood fertilizer salesman at the time of the 
slaying evers 37 when he died was field secretary for the 
mississippi branch of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people 
assistant district attorney bobby delaughter spent nearly six 
hours with the grand jury thursday 
delaughter who has spent 14 months looking into the slaying 
couldnt comment on the secret proceedings but he did say he views 
reopening the case as a way to help right an old wrong 
this single cowardly act of the person responsible for medgar 
evers assassination has probably done more to hurt the state and 
to hurt the perception of mississippi and mississippians across the 
nation and possibly the world than any other single act i can 
think of delaughter said 
if its possible to right that wrong i certainly think we 
have a responsibility of doing that if we could pick up where the 
previous investigation left off produce more evidence i think we 
have an obligation of doing that delaughter said 
state fire marshal john chamblee a jackson police detective 
sergeant at the time of the june 12 1963 slaying would not 
comment thursday after leaving the grand jury room 
one piece of evidence seen taken into the grand jury room was a 
1917 model 3006 enfield rifle equipped with a scope 
at the two 1964 trials a jackson police fingerprint expert 
testified prints found on the scope matched beckwiths 
testimony in the trials also showed beckwith obtained the rifle 
in 1960 and acquired the scope about one month before evers was 
shot beckwith testified that the rifle was stolen from him 
evers 57yearold widow now a los angeles public works 
commissioner spent most of thursday in the district attorneys 
office at the courthouse 
im here to assist in any way i possibly can with the grand 
jury hearing she said its something that needs to be put to 
rest justice needs to be done for the state of mississippi and for 
medgars family im hopeful this time

president bush seeking to avoid a damaging 
civil rights dispute said friday he has asked his staff to get a 
quick readout on an education department ruling that could bar 
colleges from directing scholarship funds to minorities 
were looking at it right now bush said at a news 
conference when asked about the surprise decision which drew an 
immediate outcry from civil rights and education leaders 
the education departments assistant secretary for civil rights 
michael l williams on wednesday announced that it was illegal for 
federally supported institutions to offer scholarships specifically 
for minorities 
he cited title vi of the 1964 civil rights act which prohibits 
discrimination on the ground of race color or national origin in 
any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance 
the white house acknowledged friday that it was caught offguard 
by the decision presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
that while bush supports affirmative action programs for 
minorities he is against quota systems 
this is a kind of an inbetween case that is not clear exactly 
where it comes through how it would be applied what it means 
fitzwater said 
bush defended williams saying he was an extrardinarily 
sensitive person i dont think anyone would accuse him of doing it 
on a racist basis 
williams 37 is a black lawyer who prosecuted racial crimes in 
the reagan administrations justice department and served as deputy 
assistant secretary for law enforcement in the treasury department 
before moving to education 
williams on friday told louisville civil rights activist rev 
louis coleman that the issue of racespecific scholarships was 
still under discussion coleman told the associated press 
coleman quoted williams as saying the issue was now in other 
hands suggesting that higher officials in the bush 
administration had moved in to prevent a further widening of the 
rift between bush and civil rights groups 
bush this fall vetoed a major civil rights bill passed by 
congress on the grounds it would create quota systems in the 
employment of minorities civil rights groups said the veto showed 
the administrations insensitivity to minority problems 
on friday civil rights leaders jesse jackson said the education 
departments premise that minority scholarships are illegal because 
we now live in a colorblind society is patently false and 
morally reprehensible 
he said the president has the power to overrule williams and 
we must write and telephone president bush and register our 
protest and outrage 
also on friday deputy secretary of education ted sanders met 
the leaders of six national educational associations to assure them 
that scholarships already granted to minority students will not be 
affected 
sanders said the department hopes to issue a clarification on 
the issue in the next few weeks department spokesman john bertak 
said 
educators say they are not clear what programs or how many 
people could be affected by the ruling federally funded programs 
to assist minorities are apparently not involved and private grants 
are permissible targeted would be college and university programs 
that set aside funding specifically for certain minorities 
robin robinson director of financial aid at american university 
in washington said her schools 11 million frederick douglass 
program aimed mainly at minorities from local high schools should 
be safe because other factors besides race are considered but she 
said were just waiting to see what the intent of it the 
ruling is 
the house education and labor committee is to open hearings 
wednesday on the scholarship issue with williams among those 
testifying committee officials said

the president of the general assembly said 
friday that he will visit palestinian refugee camps in the 
israelioccupied territories and jordan next month 
guido de marco made the announcement the day after the 
159member un body voted overwhelmingly in favor of sanctions 
against israel for occupying the west bank and gaza strip and to 
convene an international peace conference 
de marco who is the foreign minister of malta also repeated 
the call for a middle east peace conference at a news conference 
friday saying it must become a reality 
general assembly resolutions are not legally binding but they 
carry moral weight as the expression of the will of the 
international community especially in the postcold war era when 
the united states and the soviet union are cooperating on many 
issues 
by contrast resolutions passed by the 15nation security 
council are considered legally binding the united states has been 
trying to prevent any reference to a middle east peace conference 
in a draft resolution providing more protection for the 
palestinians 
the united states maintains such a reference might be 
misinterpreted by iraqi president saddam hussein as linking the 
israelipalestinian issue to iraqs invasion of kuwait which the 
united states refuses to do 
de marco told reporters his trip to the palestinian camps was to 
give the human problem more political importance than it has had 
so far 
the visit would be the first time the president of the general 
assembly has been to the camps un officials said 
de marcos itinerary was not disclosed but the trip was 
expected to take place in the first week of january and will 
probably include meetings with government leaders in israel and 
jordan the officials said 
the united states and nonaligned members of the security 
council are at an impasse over the reference to an international 
peace conference in the draft resolution although it merely states 
longstanding us policy negotiations are continuing and the 
council is to meet again monday 
some arab members have indicated that if the the stalemate 
persists in the council they would try to raise the issue in the 
general assembly 
de marco said friday that he did not want to force a 
contradiction between the positions of the assembly and the 
council and therefore hoped the issue could be resolved without 
recourse to the assembly 
de marco in line with usual un policy said that a peace 
conference should include all interested parties including israel 
and the palestine liberation organization but should not preclude 
bilateral negotiations 
israeli officials have rejected a peace conference saying that 
the primary vehicle for peace should be bilateral negotiations with 
its neighbors they have said israel would refuse to accept a 
settlement imposed upon it and would not negotiate with the plo

criminal charges were filed against a 
couple belonging to a secretive sect that shuns formal medical care 
after their son was found close to death from an unattended heart 
tumor 
the couple are members of end time ministries a tenet of the 
christian cult is that doctors and hospitals are instruments of the 
devil 
death was a high probability when william myers 16 of lake 
city was taken oct 22 to gainesvilles shands hospital by his 
parents nearly seven months into his illness court records show 
the oncehusky myers arrived at the hospital weighing less than 
100 pounds he suffered not only from the heart tumor but also from 
liver and kidney failure he was unable to walk because of running 
sores on his feet 
youve seen those pictures of people in nazi concentration 
camps their arms and legs about as big around as a finger thats 
about how he looked said beryl mayo a columbia county sheriffs 
investigator 
the youth told mayo that he had never in his life been taken to 
a doctor 
an emergency heart operation saved the youths life and he 
remains hospitalized 
his parents charles and marilee myers were charged dec 5 with 
child abuse they are free on bond pending an arraignment 
the state department of health and rehabilitative services would 
not comment as a matter of policy on the case and would not say 
if the teen was still in his parents custody the prosecutor could 
not immediately be reached several hundred end timers live in this 
community of 10000 people in northern florida forming a tight 
community nearly impervious to outsiders their leader is charles 
meade who brought his distinctive religious beliefs to florida 
from indiana in 1984 
meade teaches that illness is a sign of sin and that faith is 
the only true medicine the doctrine helped shield his followers 
from prosecution two years ago when the myers 4dayold grandson 
died after a threeday nosebleed 
doctors testified at the inquest that an injection of vitamin k 
would have saved the boys life no charges were filed 
but a thirddegree murder conviction against christian 
scientists whose 7yearold daughter died in sarasota of 
complications from diabetes convinced prosecutors to pursue the 
case against the myerses 
the myerses could not be reached for comment their attorney 
karin moore refused comment through her secretary a woman 
answering the phone at meades house refused to discuss the case or 
end time ministries 
lake city optician anne conner said the end timers have made 
neighbors in the housing development where they live uneasy 
two sentries carrying walkietalkies continually watch the 
neighborhood conner said they stopped cars and asked motorists 
why they were in the area until the sheriff told them to stop 
conner after researching the groups history held neighborhood 
meetings to share what she had learned 
an iowabased group that monitors medicineshy religious bodies 
has charged the sects beliefs have led to the deaths of a dozen 
children in florida montana south dakota and illinois 
it scared the heck out of me to think that this was going to 
happen in this town conner said i guess i felt threatened

a former prosecutor faulted in an unfair 
murder trial that wrongly put a man in prison for 21 years is under 
investigation by the florida bar for alleged misconduct in another 
murder case 
the bar launched an investigation of frank schaub this week 
following a florida supreme court decision citing instances of 
misconduct too numerous to list in the 1987 trial of frederick 
charles nowitzke 
the court unanimously threw out nowitzkes murder convictions 
and death sentence dec 6 and suggested schaubs conduct warrants 
disciplinary action 
the nature of the complaint is interfering with justice 
said barbara malatino an administrative assistant in the bars 
tampa office 
all he ever did was prosecute the very best he knew how 
said mack futch a longtime friend and assistant to schaub ive 
never known him to do anything unethical in my time ive never 
heard of a vigorous prosecution resulting in an ethics 
investigation 
it is the second highprofile murder case in two years in which 
schaub has been publicly criticized 
after two decades behind bars james richardson was freed last 
year after a judge ruled the former arcadia fruit picker didnt get 
a fair trial in 1968 in the poisoning death of one of his children 
seven of richardsons children died from a pesticidetainted lunch 
in 1967 
the bar regulates lawyers and can recommend the state supreme 
court take disciplinary action from reprimand to removal from 
legal practice 
schaub retired in 1988 after 16 years as state attorney and 12 
as a circuit judge he still is a licensed lawyer 
nowitzke was convicted in the 1985 shooting deaths of his mother 
frances carroll 53 stepbrother brett carroll 11 and the 
wounding of his stepfather former major league pitcher clay 
carroll 49 in their bradenton home 
the supreme court particularly criticized schaub for personally 
attacking detroit psychiatrist dr emanuel tanay who testified the 
defendant was insane at the time of the shootings 
with the jury present schaub asked tanay whether he had once 
been called a hired gun and implied tanay charged 600 an hour 
for his services when schaub knew his fee was 150 an hour the 
court said 
he also made derogatory remarks about tanays hometown and 
insulted the witness generally the court found 
after sitting through 13 days of mr schaubs courtroom 
antics i think its more than appropriate said assistant public 
defender jim slater who represented nowitzke 31 
dade county state attorney janet reno appointed by gov bob 
martinez to investigate the case concluded last year that schaub 
suppressed evidence and knowingly used perjured testimony at 
richardsons trial 
richardson 54 is suing schaub former desoto sheriff frank 
cline the state and desoto county in us district court in tampa 
alleging they conspired to violate his civil rights 
the case was scheduled for trial in january but has been 
postponed until march because the 69yearold schaub is ill

police use tear gas and buckshot to 
rout demonstrators who attacked legislators minutes after the 
national assembly passed a law friday allowing firing of public 
workers who back a coup 
unofficial reports said three legislators were among at least 10 
people injured none seriously 
hundreds of enraged government employees set upon lawmakers with 
rocks and clubs as the legislators were leaving the national 
assembly after the vote 
police fired buckshot and tear gas canisters that forced the 
demonstrators to retreat from barricades they had thrown up in 
downtown panama city 
the law followed a dec 5 coup attempt led by a noriega ally 
former col eduardo herrera and is retroactive to dec 4 the day 
before the attempt 
fridays clash was the second in less than 24 hours many 
merchants in the area had shuttered their businesses and posted 
armed guards 
many said they feared the kind of looting they suffered last 
year when us troops invaded and deposed gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
riot police and protesters clashed for more than two hours 
thursday night in an earlier demonstration against the legislation 
the government says manythe choice of martin to replace elizabeth dole 
who resigned to 
head the american red cross will assure the continuing presence of 
at least one woman in bushs cabinet 
another congresswoman defeated in an effort to unseat a 
democratic senator patricia saiki of hawaii is considered a 
frontrunner for the top position at the education department where 
lauro cavazos was forced to resign this week 
bush called martin 51 a distinguished public servant and 
cherished friend the president was scheduled to meet with martin 
at the white house on monday 
the announcement got a somewhat chillier reception from labor 
leaders lane kirkland president of the 142 millionmember 
aflcio said that during her 10year tenure in congress her voting 
record has not reflected a sensitivity to the needs of workers 
bushs announcement made hastily before he boarded a helicopter 
for camp david md appeared designed to end a week of turmoil 
within the administration on a positive note 
cavazos resigned wednesday after being told to leave by white 
house chief of staff john sununu according to administration 
sources and bushs choice as the new republican party chairman 
william bennett bowed out thursday when he found out how 
drastically new ethics rules would limit his outside income 
martin in illinois on friday was informed only an hour ahead 
of the formal announcement that she had landed the job an 
administration source said martin declined to be interviewed but 
issued a brief statement saying her nomination was a high 
honor 
i look forward to appearing before the senate for the upcoming 
confirmation hearings she said thanking bush for his 
confidence and support 
sen edward m kennedy dmass whose senate labor and human 
resources committee will hold martins confirmation hearings 
commended her on her nomination he said the department needs 
someone who could stand up for hardpressed families against the 
constant probusiness tilt of the white house 
in making his announcement bush said martin had served as an 
unofficial adviser to him on legislative matters in the past 
she backed him in his first presidential bid in 1980 helped him 
prepare for his vice presidential debate with democrat geraldine 
ferraro in 1984 and was a national cochairman of his presidential 
campaign two years ago 
it was also apparent that bush felt he owed her something for 
her party loyalty in giving up a safe house seat to make the uphill 
bid against sen paul simon she had been passed over in bushs 
first round of cabinet appointments after the 1988 election partly 
because of her own interest in the senate 
shes a mother who knows the need for child care shes a 
professional who understands the businesslabor relationship and 
as a congresswoman she spent years dealing with the concerns and 
aspirations of the working americans from every walk of life 
bush said 
rep saiki had also been considered in the running for the labor 
post as well as for the education slot 
martin and saiki were seen as likely nominees for several 
reasons political analysts said they are women they are seen as 
being owed something because they gave up house seats with bushs 
encouragement to make the senate bids and as capitol veterans 
they could help him push administration policy in congress 
in addition saiki an asianamerican would add a minority 
member to a cabinet that lost cavazos a hispanicamerican 
besides the cabinet openings before bush this week the 
highprofile job of rnc chairman was added to the equation when 
bennett the former drug policy director said hed changed his 
mind about taking the job 
three cabinet secretaries are among those frequently mentioned 
as contenders for the rnc post samuel skinner of transportation 
robert mosbacher of commerce and jack kemp of housing and urban 
development along with former rep thomas loeffler of texas and 
longtime bush campaign strategist rich bond 
if skinner mosbacher or kemp took the job that would give bush 
yet another cabinet opening to fill 
besides saiki those also considered potential choices for 
education secretary include lynne cheney chairwoman of the 
national endowment for the humanities former new jersey gov 
thomas kean now president of drew university and former tennessee 
gov lamar alexander now president of the university of tennessee 
cheney the wife of defense secretary dick cheney has also been 
mentioned as a candidate for the labor post 
martin has never had a close alliance with organized labor 
according to the aflcios scorecard she voted right on 
workers issues 29 percent of the time 
when bush tapped mrs dole for the labor post two years ago his 
action was seen as a way for republicans to mend fences with 
organized labor leaders who had had a hostile relationship with the 
reagan administration 
analysts say more cabinet changes might follow soon kemp 
skinner and mosbacher are all said to be itchy as well as attorney 
general dick thornburgh

a detonator fragment from the bomb that brought 
down pan am flight 103 links libya to the 1988 attack that killed 
270 people a newspaper reported friday 
the report quoted unidentified senior sources as saying 
indictments have been held up because any us action against libya 
would risk alienating arab members of the multinational force 
against iraq in the persian gulf 
in its report the independent said the evidence came to light 
three months ago and is based on a detonator fragment found in a 
field close to the southern scottish town of lockerbie the plane 
blew up over that town 
the fragment matched a detonator found in a radiocassette bomb 
seized from two libyan agents at dakar airport in senegal in 
february 1988 10 months before the flight 103 attack the 
newspaper reported the two men were later released by senegalese 
authorities 
investigators have said the bomb that exploded on the pan am 
plane was also hidden in a radiocassette recorder 
reports of possible libyan involvement have appeared recently in 
the french and us media but the paper said it is the first time 
that senior sources confirmed that proof exists implicating col 
moammar gadhafis regime 
it quoted one of the sources as saying not only do we now 
know gadhafi was responsible he also knows we know 
some previous reports speculated the bombing was planned by a 
germanbased cell of the radical syriabased popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command headed by ahmed jibril 
the bomb was reportedly made with semtex a czechoslovak explosive 
terrorist experts and western news reports have theorized that 
jibrils organization was hired by iran to avenge the deaths of 290 
people aboard an iran air jetliner accidentally shot down by the 
us navy in july 1988 
jibril a former syrian army officer has denied involvement in 
the pan am attack 
scottish police have also said that they were investigating 
mohammed abu talb who was convicted in sweden of carrying out 
several attacks against american and israeli targets in 1985 and 
1986 
in a separate story the independent suggested libya may have 
masterminded the pan am attack to seek revenge for the us air 
strike on the libyan capital of tripoli in 1986 there were some 
us servicemen aboard the pan am flight 
unidentified sources cited by the independent said both the 
senegal device and the fragment found near lockerbie were from the 
same swiss manufacturer 
a spokesman for scotlands senior law officer the lord 
advocate declined to comment on what he called media 
speculation he said indictments are not being drawn up at 
this time 
the plane was blown up over lockerbie on dec 21 1988 while on 
its way to new york all 259 people on board and 11 others on the 
ground were killed the flight originated in frankfurt germany 
with a stop at londons heathrow airport

the soviet union reported khmara was in critical condition and 
being treated by doctors after ending his hunger strike thursday 
the tass news agency on friday also reported he had ended the 
hunger strike 
according to keston college khmaras arrest stemmed from an 
incident nov 7 when he stopped to help a woman who said she had

prime minister yitzhak shamir on friday 
proposed regional talks on water sharing and disarmament he also 
indicated israel is ready to discuss dismantling the nuclear 
weapons it reportedly possesses 
his proposals reflect growing worry over conflicting reports of 
iraqs nuclear capability and a drought that is draining water 
reserves in the mideast 
shamir spoke on israel television on his return from talks with 
president bush in washington 
i would like to add to the agenda of the peace talks today a 
discussion of regional ideas to start with solving regional 
problems that are important to all countries in the region like 
the water problem 
it is conceivable that we will also have to find a way to add 
to these talks the very heavy subject that has been discussed a lot 
recently and that is reducing the amount of weapons in the 
region he added on israel television 
when asked if israel was ready to dismantle nonconventional 
weapons shamir answered i said that israel is ready to 
participate in such an effort that would reduce the amount of 
weaponry and that would limit weapons 
shamir added that in his term as foreign minister 10 years ago 
he had advocated and presented a concrete proposal for a region 
free of nuclear weapons 
israel has repeatedly refused to respond to foreign reports it 
has about 100 nuclear bombs giving it the worlds sixthlargest 
nuclear stockpile however officials have said that israel would 
not be the first to use atomic weapons in the middle east 
shamirs proposals came amidst concerns the united states will 
support calls in the united nations for a broad middle east peace 
conference to deal with the arabisraeli conflict 
such a move would be a radical departure from the us position 
supporting israels proposal for israelipalestinian talks on 
limited autonomy for the residents of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip israel opposes an international conference 
the israeli initiative has been in deadlock since it led to the 
fall of a broad coalition government in march 1988 
shamir who now leads a rightwing coalition has said peace 
with arab neighbors must come before any settlement with the 
palestinians 
shamir made his proposals friday in the wake of recent reports 
that iraq is on a crash program to become the first arab state with 
nuclear weapons 
experts differ on how close the iraqi arsenal is to being ready 
some say iraq will be able to build a usable bomb within five 
years others say it will take 10 years 
in proposing the focus on water shamir is reacting to 
statements by experts who say the region will face dangerous 
depletion of its water sources by 1995 
israel has depleted all its reserves and may have to resort to 
importing water if there is another drought year syria and jordan 
already ration water and some areas get water only a few times a 
week egypt also faces severe problems as its population 
multiplies

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
trounced in last months presidential election left office on 
friday by telling parliament he had tried not to raise national 
expectations beyond what could be attained 
this governments role was to make this painful beginning 
mazowiecki said in an address ending his 15month term as the 
former east blocs first noncommunist leader 
we did not try to arouse hopes which could not be fulfilled 
mazowiecki told parliament in apparent response to criticism by 
presidentelect lech walesa and others that his government had 
moved too slowly toward economic and social reforms 
parliament then voted 22416 to accept his resignation there 
were 122 abstentions 
meanwhile an aide to walesa said the presidentelect had 
resolved the main problems in negotiations to select a new 
prime minister the aide did not disclose the makeup of the walesa 
government 
mazowiecki was beaten nov 25 in the first round of polands 
first popular presidential election by stanislaw tyminski an 
unknown emigre promising an economic quick fix walesa on dec 9 
defeated tyminski by a wide margin 
mazowiecki submitted his governments resignation two days after 
the firstround vote but agreed to stay on in a caretaker capacity 
until parliament accepts walesas new government a process 
expected to take a few weeks 
surrounded by his cabinet the prime minister somberly accepted 
a standing ovation following the vote 
mazowiecki cited the disappearance of store lines the improved 
selection of consumer goods the stabilization of the currency and 
development of a private sector as signs of permanent changes 
made in poland during his tenure 
he also listed the establishment of an uncensored press freely 
elected local governments a permanent border with united germany 
and a democratic political system as among his governments 
accomplishments 
we are building a democratic system and we all have to 
respect democratic rules mazowiecki said but this peaceful 
transition is testimony to how far along the road poland has 
moved from a totalitarian state to a democratic state 
he said newly emerging political factions should continue to 
exist and develop but they should not let their grudges block 
the countrys higher good 
we face a difficult period now in order to get through it 
together a new consensus of the main political forces is 
necessary he said 
we underwent the transition from a centralized economy 
governed by ideology with an economy that was in a state of decay 
destroyed by hyperinflation to a rational economic system where 
there is the basis of competitive market and a market balance he 
said 
after mazowieckis speech the leader of the solidarity caucus 
walesa ally mieczyslaw gil said mazowieckis name would symbolize 
polands return to the family of free nations but he said more 
should have been done to help farmers and fight unemployment

singing attended a closing rally for the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide a radical populist priest believed to be the 
frontrunner among 11 presidential candidates 
police moved through the crowd searching handbags and clothing 
for weapons but there were no incidents to the chants of 
hallelujah people carried placards reading aristide will 
save haiti and sang its you were looking for now we are 
saved 
aristide carrying poinsettias was mobbed by a throng of 
screaming fans before he briefly addressed the crowd 
we are the flowers of brotherhood the roman catholic leader 
said we are carrying the flowers to victory 
haiti has been ruled by dictators virtually since it won 
independence from france in 1804 and established the worlds first 
black republic two elections held the past four years have been 
rigged or halted because of violence 
but many haitians said friday they believed foreign observers 
would make a difference this time 
even if 100 people get killed the election will go on said 
jeanclaude bajeux a civil rights activist who spent many years in 
exile during the duvalier family dictatorship 
about 3 million people are registered to vote for president 
bicameral legislature mayors and county officials the government 
has set up 14500 polling places and they will be open from 6 am 
to 6 pm sunday 
the elections gained new vigor a month ago when aristide 
declared his candidacy he is the favorite of the poor who make up 
most of this caribbean nations 6 million residents 
an advocate of liberation theology or church involvement in the 
struggles of the poor aristide was expelled from the salesian 
order in 1988 for allegedly fomenting revolution 
he remains a priest however and has said he would renounce the 
priesthood to comply with vatican rules against holding public 
office if he wins the election 
marc bazin a former world bank economist and finance minister 
fired by the dictatorial duvalier regime for investigating 
corruption is believed to be the favorite of the middle class he 
has a considerable following in the countryside 
bazin campaigned friday in the mountain town of tomassin 
overlooking the wealthy suburb of petionville 
people like me a working man will vote for aristide because 
he stands for change said a street vendor who would only give 
his first name antoine the bourgeoise will vote for bazin 
election observers from the united nations organization of 
american states and the caribbean economic community will monitor 
the vote 
former president jimmy carter who has monitored elections in 
panama and nicaragua arrived friday afternoon with a team of 34 
observers from the council of freely elected heads of government 
president bush sent former gov william janklow of south dakota 
as head of an eightmember us government delegation 
the election in haiti offers a historic opportunity for the 
haitian people to freely choose their leaders after decades of 
dictatorship said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
a state department spokesman appealed for haitians to shun 
violence in the final days of the campaign the united states 
supports haitis electoral process and encourages all haitians to 
conduct the final days of the campaign in a peaceful atmosphere 
said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler in washington 
at the request of the interim government of president 
erthapascal trouillot the united nations sent 64 unarmed military 
advisers to work with haitis notoriously illdisciplined army to 
prevent election violence 
until 1986 the duvalier family enforced its rule for 29 years 
with the help of a brutal private militia known as the tonton 
macoutes 
the dictatorship ended in 1986 after jeanclaude duvalier fled 
to exile in france 
many holdovers from the duvalier regime have remained intent on 
keeping their hold on power and have sabotaged elections twice 
since jeanclaude was deposed 
the elections in 1987 were aborted after armybacked thugs 
massacred 34 voters at the polls the army dissolved the 
independent electoral council and held rigged elections in 1988 
there has been relatively little violence during this years 
campaign 
fears of a bloody election were heightened on dec 5 when 
unidentified assailants threw a grenade and opened fire on people 
leaving an aristide rally killing seven and wounding more than 50 
others 
aristide blamed the attack on roger lafontant selfproclaimed 
chief of the tonton macoutes and avid duvalier supporter and 
demanded his arrest lafontant denied his involvement 
lafontant returned from exile to run for president but was 
disqualified on technicalities by the electoral council 
he said this week he was the head of the tonton macoutes and the 
duvalierist movement and that he was determined to keep aristide 
from becoming president

nearly 50 jubilant westerners 
who had been trapped in iraq and kuwait touched down on american 
soil friday led by the us diplomats who had refused to leave 
without them 
first to bound off the plane was nathaniel howell the 
ambassador to kuwait who had spent more than three months in the 
besieged us embassy 
its great to be home howell declared im delighted to 
bring home with me the last planeload of americans who want to 
leave kuwait 
the group was greeted in the biting december wind by secretary 
of state james a baker iii who saluted them for being 
victorious over an uncivilized and brutal ordeal 
but baker added while your ordeal has ended that of the 
kuwaiti people continues as you were freed now too we must see 
kuwait freed of iraqi occupation 
the hostages were welcomed by a crowd of cheering friends and 
family members waving flags and bearing balloons a young woman 
wearing a free kuwait sweatshirt handed out red roses 
the hostages were whisked off to a private reception area where 
they were to be helped with emergency loans plane tickets and 
accommodations 
only one wayne cox 40 of orlando fla would talk with 
reporters he had been hiding in kuwait with his wife layla and 
their three children 
cox praised president bushs policies and advocated military 
action to liberate kuwait 
it cant go on much longer he said its just devastated 
cars are completely stripped everywhere houses burned stores 
burned 
howell noted that he had left the flag flying when he left the 
us embassy in kuwait and he vowed it would reopen in time with 
new staff 
the ordeal of the kuwaitis still persists the people 
there must be freed he said 
baker said iraqs saddam hussein deserved no reward for his 
release of the hostages 
there must be no thanks or praise for the release of innocent 
people who he never should have kidnapped in the first place 
baker said 
he said saddams aggression and the ordeal of the hostages 
jars our sense of human decency and civility 
howell and the four remaining members of his barebones embassy 
staff left iraq on thursday on what was expected to be the last 
us charter flight to evacuate westerners from iraq and occupied 
kuwait 
after an overnight stop in frankfurt germany many of the 
hostages were flown to andrews air force base outside washington 
aboard a c5 military transport plane 
the passengers included 23 americans 10 nonus citizen family 
members as well as 15 people going to canada officials said 
howell 50 had been winding up a threeyear stint in kuwait and 
was preparing to leave when iraq invaded the emirate on aug 2 
shortly thereafter saddam ordered the closure of all foreign 
missions in kuwait and cut off services to those embassies that 
defied him 
howell and others on the embassy staff held our for more than 
three months living mainly on rice tuna and boiled water from the 
embassy swimming pool 
the diplomats left only after they were satisfied that all 
americans in kuwait had been given a chance to leave 
hundreds of western hostages have departed iraq and kuwait since 
saddam last week agreed to let them go any remaining americans who 
wish to leave can take commercial flights according to the state 
department

a suspicious fire fanned by high wind sped 
through a crowded neighborhood friday damaging 11 threefamily 
houses and leaving more than 100 people homeless many of them 
needy immigrants authorities said 
emergency officials who went to evacuate residents said they had 
trouble communicating the urgency of the problem to people who did 
not speak english 
they were just reluctant to leave they didnt realize the 
scope of what was going on said deputy fire chief dan doherty 
no deaths or serious injuries were reported seven firefighters 
from revere boston and chelsea suffered smoke inhalation or other 
injuries three civilians were treated for minor injuries police 
said 
mayor george colella declared an emergency in the workingclass 
suburb north of boston and said 125 to 160 residents were displaced 
by the blaze the red cross said it helped 132 people displaced by 
the early morning fire 
vin ven 25 who is three months pregnant escaped with her 
father mother sister and brother all of whom came here from 
cambodia in recent years now it is burned my place now i got 
no place to live she said 
fire chief james connery declared the blaze a conflagration the 
highest level of fire and said it was the worst he had seen in his 
35 years with the department when you declare a conflagration 
mutual aid automatically takes over he said 
all fire equipment in the boston metropolitan area was made 
available to revere and at least 17 departments sent firefighters 
the fire began in a vacant boardedup building connery said it 
may have been set along with two of three other fires reported 
earlier in the night 
were leaning very strongly that way he said i cant 
tell definitely that they were deliberately set but it certainly 
looks that way there were too many fires in too short a time 
arson investigators were called in and a dog was brought in that 
can sniff out chemicals used to start or feed a fire and police 
looked for a white car seen near three of the homes that burned 
temperatures in the 20s and wind blowing to 30 mph created a 
wind chill factor of near zero and ice covered the streets before 
the blaze was declared under control after four hours some fire 
engines were encased in ice 
the only thing that really helped us was that the wind died 
down doherty said that kind of gave us a little chance 
the neighborhood one of the most densely packed in revere is 
made up mostly of asian hispanic and portuguese residents 
janice foley escaped her home with her four children and 
disabled husband after trying to hose down porches to keep sparks 
from igniting her secondfloor apartment 
the flames and sparks came across the street foley said 
we ran outside and had to go onto the sidewalk then everything 
started dropping through 
foley said she lost everything including christmas presents for 
her family and presents for 19 head start children she supervises 
the houses are called tripledeckers a style common in the 
boston area that was developed in the early part of the century to 
accommodate burgeoning city populations often a family would live 
on one floor and rent the two other floors 
in addition to five homes that were destroyed one was badly 
damaged and five others suffered either exterior damage or water 
damage 
gov michael s dukakis visited the scene and said the state 
will seek funds to help rebuild the neighborhood asked where the 
state will get money given the current fiscal crunch dukakis said 
well if there isnt any well get it 
classes were canceled at the city high school so that those left 
homeless could be served by the red cross in the school gym 
its challenging all year long but its particularly 
difficult to find housing at christmas time said amy glick a 
red cross nurse what well need to do is work with each family 
on a case by case basis

beleaguered eastern airlines continued as 
recently as last month to falsify vital safety and maintenance 
records according to a confidential informat cited in a 
government document unsealed friday 
eastern angrily denied the allegations contained in the 
document which is an affidavit to support a raid earlier this 
month on the airlines miami headquarters 
the document details a lengthy pattern of doctoring safety logs 
and other records to keep the airlines jets in the air 
release of the document was a publicrelations setback for 
eastern which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection 
since march 1989 because of a strike that has still not been 
resolved 
eastern said there has been no conspiracy to cut corners on 
safety as the government has alleged in a criminal case in 
brooklyn 
the airline has continued to lose enormous amounts of money but 
its courtappointed trustee martin r shugrue jr has predicted 
eastern will start breaking even sometime next year shugrue also 
has been leading an aggressive publicity campaign for eastern in 
attempt to win more customers 
in response to the latest allegations shugrue said the 
government has a personal vendetta against him and a vendetta 
against the company 
federal investigators using a search warrant went into easterns 
offices on dec 1 and carried out boxes of documents and computer 
records said us attorney andrew j maloney 
according to a confidential informant eastern supervisors are 
under so much pressure to avoid delays that record falsification is 
the norm the affidavit said 
maintenance workers at hartsfield airport in atlanta routinely 
falsified log books to hide faulty navigation radar and other 
electronic equipment as well as bad tires and windshields that 
leaked air informants told investigators 
confidential informants told investigators that flight delays 
caused by necessary repairs or maintenance were simply not 
tolerated by easterns upper management the document said 
one informant in atlanta said he witnessed supervisors on 
almost a daily basis falsifying log books to make it appear that 
inoperative cockpit instruments had been repaired when in reality 
they had not been repaired the affidavit said 
last friday us district judge i leo glasser of brooklyn 
ruled that the affidavit unsealed friday should be made public 
however he allowed eastern a chance to appeal 
the appeal went before a threejudge panel of the us court of 
appeals on thursday and it ruled in suppport on glasser on friday 
in july prosecutors in brooklyn filed criminal charges against 
eastern alleging a pattern of falsifying safety records and other 
maintenance documents to keep its jets in the air 
the airline and several of its top managers are scheduled to go 
on trial in on the charges in brooklyn federal court next year 
during a miami news conference shugrue accused the government 
of embarking on a headlinehunting exercise to damage eastern 
eastern said in a statement the faas most recent inspections 
revealed that eastern was safe and that there was no evidence to 
suggest that maintenance records were being falsified 
the airline said that based on its own investigation of specific 
allegations it was confident that a grand jury would agree that 
the charges contained in the affidavit are without merit

european community leaders agreed friday on a 1 
billion food aid package for the soviet union and said it is worth 
the price if it helps keep president mikhail s gorbachev in power 
the european leaders also were drafting a statement on the 
persian gulf crisis with italy and france pushing to give iraq 
assurances it would not be attacked if it withdraws from kuwait 
the leaders approved the emergency aid package with the 
proportion of grants and loans still to be decided at the opening 
of a twoday summit that is scheduled to launch the 12nation bloc 
on a radical path toward european unity 
it is not in the interests of europe or britain that the 
soviet union should fall into anarchy or should lapse into the 
hands of some backwardlooking tyrant said british foreign 
secretary douglas hurd 
for the longer term they agreed in principle on twoyear 14 
billion package of technical assistance for 199192 to help the 
soviet union in the fields of energy transportation distribution 
and telecommunications summit spokesman pio mastrobuoni said 
aid for the hardpressed economies of eastern europe was also 
under discussion with 140 million approved for romania and 
bulgaria mastrobuoni said 
despite britains continuing objections to certain aspects of 
european integration italian officials said britain is ready to 
fully participate in two special conferences opening saturday on 
economic and monetary union and on political unity 
the conferences are going ahead with all 12 aboard said 
mastrobuoni there are no prejudices or insurmountable obstacles 
at the start 
the government heads are preparing broad guidelines on political 
union including the possibility that the 12 countries at some 
future date would speak in one voice on security and foreign 
policy 
the european leaders stressed during their private talks that 
the soviet union doesnt face famine but is hampered by an 
inadequate distribution system and black market profiteers 
it is no good having food rotting in a siding in leningrad 
rather than rotting in a grainstore here said british prime 
minister john major making his international debut since replacing 
margaret thatcher last month 
at the same time gorbachev needs breathing room to carry out 
his economic reform program but his political hold is under 
constant challenge from various segments of soviet society 
earlier in the week the united states joined 20 other countries 
in promising or delivering food aid 
chancellor helmut kohl of germany who has been in the forefront 
of the food aid drive for the soviets denounced attempts in the 
soviet union to undermine gorbachev he warned that a gorbachev 
fall from power would cost the world a lot more than would sending 
emergency aid now 
because of the problems of getting food in from the countryside 
the europeans singled out moscow and leningrad for the emergency 
assistance 
italian premier giulio andreotti said the ec would draw 
immediately from communityheld stocks and promised the europeans 
would try to make sure the supplies reached the hungry and not 
the black market 
on the eve of the summit president bush urged the europeans in 
a letter to stand firm and united against iraq as the jan 15 
deadline set by the un security council for possible military 
action approaches 
the persian gulf crisis figured to dominate discussions at a 
state dinner at the renaissance chigi palace friday evening and it 
was also the focus of many of the bilateral talks 
italian officials said andreotti and french president francois 
mitterrand agreed on the need for a clear and explicit message 
from europe that the usdominated multinational force would not 
attack iraq if kuwait were liberated 
the two countries also agreed on the need for an international 
peace conference on the middle east and said they would welcome an 
ecwide appeal that it be held 
iraqi president saddam hussein has tried to link a resolution of 
the gulf crisis with the issue of israels occupation of 
palestinian territories an international conference would deal 
with such issues but it is opposed by israel the united states 
has rejected saddams attempt to link the issues 
major struck a noticeably more conciliatory tone than mrs 
thatcher whose denunciation of plans for a single european 
currency at the last summit isolated britain and precipitated her 
downfall 
i dont think anybody in the community wants confrontation 
said the 47yearold prime minister 
but he stressed that britain had not changed its opposition to 
the single currency and other key unity proposals 
if we were to leap ahead without proper understanding of what 
it a single currency means it could be very serious major

un troops deployed to help control religious violence that has 
left hundreds of people dead around india 
sayed abdullah bukhari claimed only a neutral force can protect 
the moslem minority from hindus in the dispute over a religious 
site 
my heart weeps my chest bleeds and the mind reels in 
confusion when i see my people being massacred bukhari chief 
clergyman of indias 105 million moslems told about 20000 people 
at the jama masjid indias largest mosque 
there is a limit to our tolerance cant the united nations 
send its forces to protect the millions of moslems of india 
bukhari asked 
at least 267 people have died in hindumoslem clashes in several 
indian cities the past eight days about half the deaths have 
occurred in hyderabad 750 miles south of new delhi 
the violence in at least seven cities stems from hindu 
fundamentalists campaign to construct a temple on a site now 
occupied by a mosque in ayodhya 300 miles east of new delhi 
hindus claim the 16th century mosque was built on the ruins of a 
temple destroyed by moslem conquerers moslems say the mosque was 
erected on a vacant plot 
at least 380 people were killed in monthlong nationwide riots 
when the ayodhya campaign began on oct 30

a us delegation was in europe on friday asking 
foreign governments to unfreeze manuel noriegas bank accounts to 
finance his legal defense but swiss officials warned their job 
wont be easy 
most of the delegations activities are classified said 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan who told a federal judge 
here the group consists of state and justice department officials 
visiting austria and switzerland 
other european nations also may be on the delegations 
itinerary said us attorneys office spokeswoman diane cossin 
she refused to identify the countries the government has said 
noriega had accounts in france 
swiss officials expect to hold talks with the delegation next 
week the nations justice ministry spokesman joerg kistler said in 
bern 
but he said if there is any evidence that the accounts contain 
illegal drug money swiss laws require confiscation 
we can only unfreeze in cases where it is clear that drug 
money is not involved the americans have to prove that to us 
kistler said 
us district judge william hoeveler who has pressed the 
government to find a way to allow the deposed panamanian leader to 
pay his own lawyers welcomed the us delegations efforts 
im satisfied at this time they are making a good faith effort 
to unfreeze funds for the defense hoeveler said 
the judge closed much of a hearing friday over the objections of 
media attorneys he explained later in open court that some of 
the areas are legitimately classified 
after the december 1989 invasion of panama and the capture of 
noriega us authorities asked european governments to freeze 
about 20 million in 27 bank accounts hoeveler ordered 6 million 
of that amount unfrozen in june but prosecutors returned to him 
last month saying european governments had stepped in with their 
own forfeiture proceedings 
the judge warned he would hold a formal hearing to show whether 
the accounts were drugrelated as the government originally 
contended such a hearing would force the government to reveal much 
of its evidence to the defense the government responded by sending 
the delegation to europe 
the only delegation member mentioned in open court was myles 
malman who is an assistant us attorney and one of noriegas 
prosecutors state department officials refused to comment on the 
delegation and the justice departments washington office did not 
immediately return telephone calls from the associated press 
the judge has offered the defense temporary appointments as 
governmentpaid lawyers but noriega lead attorney frank rubino 
says that arrangement would impose a maximum of 75 an hour far 
less than the 350 an hour he says is appropriate in a complex 
drugtrafficking case 
rubino also said the defense could not be ready before june 
hoeveler said he would set a new trial date for noriega although 
some of his codefendants could be tried on the planned date of 
jan 28 
the judge said he wanted a contempt hearing soon against cable 
news network to determine if cnn violated a court order by airing a 
taped prison telephone call between noriega and his defense team 
the judge subsequently lifted the ban against broadcasting the 
tape but only after warning cnn it still could face contempt 
fines 
noriega is confined in the metropolitan correctional center 
outside miami facing charges of accepting 46 million in bribes to 
turn panama into a way station for colombian drug traffickers

sen donald w riegle jr initiated a meeting 
between senators and thrift regulators on behalf of charles h 
keating jr a former keating aide testified friday in 
contradiction of the michigan democrats sworn statement 
james grogan was the first keating insider to testify in the 
senate ethics committee hearings and did so only under a grant of 
limited immunity that prevents his statements from being used 
against him in court 
riegle a michigan democrat and chairman of the senate banking 
committee has told the panel i did not arrange the meeting april 
2 1987 between the top thrift regulator and four senate 
colleagues who were intervening for keatings failing lincoln 
savings and loan riegle did not attend the session 
is there any doubt in your mind that sen riegle arranged the 
meeting with the senators committee special counsel robert s 
bennett asked grogan who was lincolns corporate counsel 
no sir grogan answered 
the april 2 meeting is important because the top regulator at 
the time edwin j gray has testified that sen dennis deconcini 
dariz tried to negotiate a deal for lincoln that would have 
waived a rule prohibiting risky investments deconcini has denied 
the allegation 
the committee is looking into the relationships of the keating 
five with keating it wants to know whether the five in 
addition to deconcini and riegle they are john glenn dohio alan 
cranston dcalif and john mccain rariz committed any 
improprieties in interceeding on keatings behalf with sampl 
regulators 
grogan said he later got feedback the four senators were 
miffed at riegles absence since negative news stories about 
lincolns condition made the session potentially politically 
explosive 
after grogan testified all day friday the ethics committee 
scheduled a saturday session to question him further 
riegles office issued a statement saying grogans testimony 
shows no improper activity or ethical violation by sen riegle in 
the lincoln matter unspecified statements of grogans were 
incorrect the statement said adding this will be clear in the 
days ahead 
grogan also told the committee that riegle tried to hide his 
role in initiating the meeting 
the keating executive said riegle asked him to invite the other 
senators and to ask mccain and deconcini in turn to invite riegle 
to attend 
sen mccain reacted very negatively to the suggestion 
grogan said he said he would not invite sen riegle to the 
meeting he was very unhappy with that concept 
deconcini did write an invitation to riegle to meet with 
regulators not for the april 2 meeting but to a session a week 
later between all five senators and the san franciscobased 
regulators who were investigating lincoln 
at that session the senators were advised that criminal 
referrals regarding lincoln would be sent to the justice 
department 
the committee is investigating whether the five senators 
intervention for keating was related to the 13 million he and 
associates donated to their campaigns and favorite causes 
grogan denied there was a connection testifying he never got 
the impression that any action we were requesting would require 
a contribution 
but he added i believe senators only have so many hours in 
the day and if you make a contribution you have a better chance of 
getting time in front of a senator to explain your position 
most of grogans testimony concentrated on riegles actions but 
he also said that keating dealt personally with deconcini when the 
businessman saw a chance to initiate a settlement in his feud with 
regulators 
grogan also testified that in discussions between himself 
keating and cranston topics often included both fundraising and 
the senators intervention with regulators 
in one case in 1987 grogan said cranston promised to call chief 
regulator m danny wall the same day that grogan delivered a 
250000 contribution for cranstonbacked voter registration 
groups 
and in one instance in late 1986 grogan said he was asked by 
cranstons chief fund raiser to establish a 300000 line of credit 
for the senator the credit was established but never used 
grogan said the request by fund raiser joy jacobson came during 
a phone conversation in which grogan was expressing alarm about 
proposed legislation that was damaging to lincoln 
he said that after a discussion about the legislation ms 
jacobson said now i want to switch gears and i want you to 
know this is totally unrelated 
she asked me if it would be possible that lincoln could 
make a loan to sen cranston for use in his reelection campaign 
my interpretation was it was a personal loan grogan said 
ms jacobson explained grogan said that cranston was in a 
tight race money was tighthe might have to buy tv time 
grogan testified the line of credit was arranged after lincoln 
received a legal opinion that it was proper 
grogan said that riegle volunteered to arrange a meeting between 
senators and gray during a visit the senator made in march 1987 to 
keatings parent company american continental corp of phoenix 
keating at the time was telling every politician who would 
listen that the federal home loan bank board headed by gray was 
treating lincoln unfairly and leaking damaging material on the 
thrift to the news media grogan said 
grogan testified riegle volunteered that he knew ed gray 
would talk to ed gray and thought he could set up a meeting 
during the same visit grogan said riegle discussed with 
keating a fundraising luncheon that lincolns owner was to host 
march 23 for the senator at the keatingowned ponchartrain hotel in 
detroit

oneyear term for defendant kun chae bae and ordered him to perform 
1000 hours of community service while he serves three years on 
probation afterward 
hargrove who imposed the sentence thursday said it was a 
compromise between the need to send a message to other drugmakers 
and a reward for baes cooperation with federal prosecutors in a 
continuing investigation of the generic drug industry 
bae pleaded guilty last summer to paying a 10000 illegal 
gratuity to charles y chang in return for swift approvals of myk 
generic drug applications while chang was chief of the fdas

micelli an official at the fdas medical directorate in 
philadelphia a 400 videocassette recorder a trip to chicago and 
500 in travel expenses prosecutors there said bae bribed other 
employees at the defense personnel support center in return for 
their help in obtaining supply contracts for his company 
the defendant was instrumental in changs conviction on 
racketeering charges and was a key government witness at the 
october perjury trial of marvin seife former director of the fdas 
division of generic drugs seife was convicted 
bae told hargrove that he experienced hunger and poverty as a 
youth in wartorn south korea but seized the opportunity to be 
educated in the united states he said he worked very hard to 
become a success here 
i had a dream to do the best i could bae said remorsefully 
now i am a convicted felon and i have to explain that to my 
children and grandchildren 
prosecutors gary p jordan and geoffrey r garinther credited 
bae with full cooperation in the probe which has led to the 
convictions of 16 fda and generic drug officials and companies 
bae who started myk laboratories with 1000 in 1973 and sold 
it for nearly 20 million in 1988 now owns a chicagoarea bank and 
numerous rental properties and is believed to be among the richest 
of the generic drug defendants 
defense attorneys william g hundley and ann c tighe requested 
probation for bae they said he has been active in community work 
since he sold myk laboratories 
after bae sold the company he gave its employees 1 million and 
donated another 300000 to their profitsharing plan hundley

the man accused of two fatal mail bombings 
was convicted friday of obstructing justice when he paid witnesses 
to lie in court in an unrelated bomb possession case 
a federal jury found walter leroy moody jr guilty of all 13 
charges against him in a fiveday trial 
moody 56 faces trial in mail bombings in georgia and alabama 
last year that killed a federal judge and a city councilman 
the jury convicted moody of conspiracy obstructing justice and 
obstructing a criminal investigation inducing someone else to 
commit perjury bribing a witness and witness tampering 
moody was expected to be sentenced in 60 days he could receive 
69 years in prison and nearly 23 million in fines 
the trial hinged on the testimony of two women who said moody 
paid them to lie in court when he appealed a 1972 bomb possession 
conviction moody had concocted a story and paid the women to back 
it up the appeal failed 
a third woman also testified that moody had paid her to lie at 
his 1983 trial in florida for attempted murder that case ended in 
a mistrial 
the women had been indicted with moody but were granted immunity 
in exchange for their testimony against him 
prosecutor louis freeh urged jurors not to believe moodys 
claims that he was manipulated by the female witnesses 
im saying hes a fake he is a sham freeh said 
defense lawyer ed tolley argued that the evidence showed moody 
did not know what he was doing he left a trail a child could 
follow he said 
also friday judge anthony alaimo acceded to moodys request to 
exclude a possible verdict of guilty but mentally ill 
after his attorney spent most of thursday building an insanity 
defense moody stood up and told the judge he objected a finding 
of insanity could have put moody in a psychiatric institution and 
he didnt want to risk that his lawyer said 
the recent trial was unrelated to the 70count indictment 
against moody charging him with sending two deadly mail bombs 
the december 1989 mail bombs killed 11th us circuit court of 
appeals judge robert vance in alabama and savannah attorney and 
city council member robert robinson no trial date has been set

the official newspaper china daily acknowledging 
the importance of private enterprise said friday that china plans 
to increase the number of its free markets by more than 10 percent 
in the next five years 
the announcement reflects a shift in public pronouncements since

ration coupons that let them make purchases at a discount they 
turn to free markets to supplement food supplies and buy items 
unavailable from state outlets 
since free markets reappeared in china 11 years ago they have 
been playing an increasingly important role in the daily lives of 
urban and rural residents china daily said 
after the governments violent crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in june 1989 private enterprises were targets in 
wideranging attacks on capitalism staterun media carried reports 
rebuking private businessmen accusing them of making too much 
money and of tax evasion 
official regulations still prohibit the free markets from 
selling most raw materials and many consumer items including 
tobacco liquor and cotton

a prosecutor said friday he will not 
appeal a judges dismissal of a firstdegree murder charge against 
a doctor who invented a device that an alzheimers victim used to 
kill herself 
district judge gerald mcnally on thursday threw out a 
firstdegree murder charge against retired pathologist dr jack 
kevorkian in the june 4 death of janet adkins of portland ore she 
died after activating a machine invented by kevorkian that sent 
poison into her veins 
the ruling doesnt let kevorkian use the suicide device again 
oakland county prosecutor richard thompson said the ruling left 
many moral medical ethical and religious issues unsettled 
we think judge mcnallys decision was wrong he said 
but these profound issues should be decided by the legislative 
branch of government that branch which is preeminently suited to 
consider the consensus of society 
thompson also said there was no guarantee the michigan supreme 
court or michigan court of appeals would hear the case and an 
appeal would drain county funds 
im pleased that hes not going to waste further taxpayers 
money on an appeal geoffrey fieger one of kevorkians lawyers 
and i hope hell drop the civil case as well i hope he decides 
not to enforce morality through the prosecutors office 
thompson said the county will continue its civil case blocking 
kevorkian from using his suicide machine or helping others commit 
suicide 
kevorkians machine remains in police custody after prosecutors 
obtained a temporary court order preventing its further use a 
civil trial to decide whether or not to make that order permanent 
will resume in january thompson said 
kevorkian hooked mrs adkins 54 to his device in the back of a 
van in a park in oakland county northwest of detroit adkins pushed 
a button allowing lethal drugs to drip into her system 
michigan has no laws against suicide or assisting in it but the 
legislature is considering at least two bills outlawing assisted 
suicide

soviet defense spending fell by 4 
percent in 1989 and will continue to drop in real terms until at 
least 1995 the north atlantic treaty organization reported friday 
the report was the first authoritative sign that the eastwest 
thaw has led to reduced soviet military spending earlier natos 
military leaders said they noticed no appreciable decline 
fridays report put soviet 1989 defense outlays at between 244 
billion and 266 billion according to moscows official exchange 
rate 
that would be double a figure cited by soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev in may 1989 however it is hard to reflect soviet 
defense spending in western money because the ruble is not 
convertible to other currencies and the price the kremlin pays for 
arms is well below actual production costs 
unilateral force reductions withdrawals from eastern europe 
and cuts in military production led to a 4 percent real decline in 
expenditure in 1989 nato said in an annual survey of soviet 
defense spending 
it predicted a similar drop in 1990 adding that the soviet 
defense budget is likely to decline in real terms until at least 
1995 due to the end of the cold war 
in 1989 moscow spent up to 17 percent of its gross domestic 
product on defense the report said it said the nato allies spend 
an average of 44 percent for defense 
the 16 nato allies spent an aggregate total of about 470 
billion on defense in 1989 
the nato report said the rate of decrease in soviet defense 
spending hinges on further arms control accords a possible breakup 
of the soviet union and economic reforms notably efforts to 
convert military production to civilian output 
in the 1990s nato said it expected the soviets to embark on a 
radical reduction in the size of the militaryindustrial complex 
and a further shifting of resources to the civilian sector

the 1800 patients of a surgeon who died of 
aids will be studied to determine their risk of contracting the 
virus officials of johns hopkins hospital said friday 
hospital officials urged the federal centers for disease control 
to expedite new policies regarding the obligations of health care 
workers who have been exposed to the aids virus 
the study will be conducted by the maryland department of health 
and mental hygiene the cdc and the hospital 
considering that so little is known about the possible 
risk of hiv transmission from health care workers to patients we 
felt this situation at hopkins presented a rare opportunity to 
assess that risk said kathleen f edwards director of the 
states aids administration 
the 1800 patients were operated on in the past six years by dr 
rudolph almaraz a breast cancer surgeon who died nov 16 of aids 
about 400 women have notified johns hopkins that they are 
interested in the hospitals earlier offer of aids testing and 
counseling 
our plan is to test all the patients of dr almaraz to go 
beyond those who have volunteered to what hopkins offered the 
tests would determine whether they are infected and also do 
case histories to determine if there are any other risk factors 
involved said mike golden spokesman for the state health 
department 
the lack of guidelines forces hospitals to work in a policy 
vacuum said dr hamilton moses iii the hospitals vice 
president of medical affairs 
in a letter to the cdc hospital officials outline numerous 
questions it asked the cdc to clarify 
for example moses said hospitals need to know at what point 
should aids prohibit a health care workers contact with patients 
and at what point the workers should be required to admit they are 
infected 
under maryland law workers have no such obligation said paul 
rosenberg general counsel for the hospital 
moses said the cdc has been writing the guidelines since it 
announced in july that a dentist in florida who had aids had 
infected a patient 
gayle lloyd a spokeswoman for the cdc in atlanta said friday 
that the guidelines may be distributed in a few weeks 
we share the concerns of johns hopkins and we are expediting 
and we will have our guidelines ready as soon as we can lloyd 
said 
as of sept 30 the cdc received reports of 24 health care 
workers who have become infected with the aids virus on the job 
almaraz closed his practice in march and resigned from hopkins 
on june 30 he told his patients that he was moving to texas to do 
research but made no mention of his health 
almaraz told his attorney that he contracted aids seven years 
ago when blood from an aids patient squirted into his eys and 
mouth during surgery at memorial sloankettering cancer center in 
new york a sloankettering spokesman said the hospital had no 
documentation of the incident 
johns hospital officials said friday they tried during the 
summer to confirm rumors that almaraz had aids 
moses said the state health department advised johns hopkins in 
the fall that it was not obligated to notify almarazs patients of 
the rumor after a newspaper reported that the doctor had died of 
aids the hospital sent letters to his patients offering aids 
testing and counseling 
the patients contact with almaraz presents only a slight risk 
of infection the hospital said 
we believe there was no bloodtoblood contact between dr 
almaraz and his patients rosenberg said

a jury friday decided ptl founder jim 
bakker should pay nearly 130 million to his former contributors a 
decision attorneys said made it unlikely the jailed televangelists 
followers will collect 
the only thing my client owns is a 45year lease on a 5by7 
room in a minnesota prison said gene carr one of bakkers 
attorneys bakker received a 45year sentence for fraud and 
conspiracy after a criminal trial last year 
fridays judgment came on the fifth day of jury deliberations in 
a classaction lawsuit that went to trial oct 24 
the other defendants accounting firm deloitte haskins amp 
sells david taggart bakkers former personal aide and aimee 
cortese a minister from new york who served on ptls board of 
directors were not liable for any damages the jury ruled 
also friday just 10 miles south of here in fort mill sc 
california faith healer morris cerullo closed a deal to buy the 
bankrupt ptl ministry for 425 million 
the ministry includes the heritage usa religious theme park and 
two 500room luxury hotels five restaurants a shopping mall a 
water park a conference center housing projects and more than 
1500 undeveloped acres 
my clients integrity has been vindicated said jim 
williams one of deloittes attorneys this has been a tough 
three years for them 
tom anderson lead attorney for the plaintiffs conceded after 
the verdict its unlikely his clients will collect any of the award 
from bakker bakker earns 12 cents an hour working at the federal 
medical center in rochester minn 
in order to collect any money it must have come from deloitte 
haskins amp sells he said we dont know of any deep pockets as 
far as jim bakker goes 
the accounting firm renamed deloitte amp touche after a merger 
is the nations fourthlargest 
the lawsuit claim totaled 757 million when it was filed in 1987 
by about 145000 contributors that ptl called lifetime 
partners they alleged bakker conspired with other ptl officials 
and accountants to set up secret bank accounts to give bakker his 
wife tammy faye and other ministry leaders huge bonuses 
anderson who spent more than 2 million of his own money on the 
case said he was very very disappointed with the verdict 
i feel that deloitte haskins amp sells got away with something 
and i dont like it anderson said the money is not the worst 
thing i just dont think justice was done 
anderson said he will appeal 
the jury deliberated for nearly 28 hours jury forewoman denise 
elsner said the panel knew that any damages against bakker would be 
virtually uncollectable 
a bankruptcy trustee closed bakkers heritage usa theme park 
last year and bakker was fined 500000 when he was imprisoned 
she said jurors agreed that bakker defrauded his flock but we 
didnt feel he was a racketeer a finding that automatically 
would have tripled damages 
guy forcucci a tax partner at deloitte haskins amp sells began 
to cry when the jurys decision was made and gave an associate a 
victory punch 
i just have gratitude the jury focused on the issues and not 
the innuendo he said this has been hell for me the past three 
years i just hope this is the last chapter in the ptl saga 
the jury said bakker should pay 129618000 in actual damages 
and 129618 in punitive damages the jury said bakker would be 
required to pay punitive damages because he committed common law 
fraud 
the jury did not elaborate on how it arrived at the figures 
another large accounting firm philadelphiabased laventhol amp 
horwath was named in the lawsuit but the proceeding against the 
firm was halted in midtrial when it filed for protection under 
chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law 
during their deliberations the jurors had asked to see several 
items including a video of bakker hawking lifetime partnerships 
bakkers criminal indictments various brochures about lifetime 
partnership programs and a bill sent by former ptl builder roe 
messner on a payment of 265000 to jessica hahn 
bakker resigned from his fort mill sc ministry on march 19 
1987 amid a sex and money scandal involving ms hahn 
mrs elsner described jury deliberations as festive yet 
excruciating 
it was not like la law it was more like the three 
stooges she quipped 
were all going to go home now and have a nervous breakdown 
said mrs elsner a social worker 
cerullo head of san diegobased morris cerullo world 
evangelism did not attend fridays negoatiations on the sale in 
september he closed a 7 million deal for the former ptl 
television studios and satellite network and began a monthlong 
telethon that raised about 11 million of the money he needed to 
buy the rest of heritage usa 
secured creditors who have deeds to parts of the ptl estate as 
collateral for their investments or loans stand to get about 39 
million from the sale but nonsecured creditors the donors who 
won fridays settlement stand to receive little or nothing from 
the sale

the two days of riots followed government concessions that 
allowed formation of albanias first noncommunist party the small 
balkan nation south of yugoslavia is ruled by the last stalinist 
regime remaining in europe 
journalists and intellectuals had said communist president ramiz 
alia was meeting with leaders of the democratic party of albania 
formed on wednesday as both sides appealed for calm and a halt to 
unrest in provincial cities 
but an intellectual said later the meeting never took place he 
said he talked with others who had wanted to participate and 
indicated the explanation by authorities was that no meeting was 
needed because all that must be done and said has been done and 
said no more words now we must work 
alia decided this week to allow alternative parties popular 
uprisings last year toppled the other communist governments in 
eastern europe alia appeared to be trying to avoid an explosion of 
popular discontent over living conditions and decades of communist 
repression 
but on friday the angry crowd in elbasan stoned official 
buildings broke windows looted food shops set fire to 
different shops cars and machinery said the ata journalist who 
spoke on condition of anonymity

tv and said that democracy and socialism were in danger in albania 
the intellectual in tirana contacted by telephone from vienna 
expressed concern that the violence is commanded by a hidden 
hand who this is i cannot grasp

achieved in tirana he said exactly it is done only for this 
to get the new events the new freedom into difficulty

thursday in the southern town of saranda on the adriatic coast

and the new party when the party was formed tens of thousands of 
people cheered party leaders at a peaceful rally

economic reforms and adherence to international human rights 
guidelines 
on wednesday alia appealed on nationwide tv and radio for 
peaceful change in albania which has been under rigid communist 
rule since 1944 
his decision to allow alternative political movements may have 
touched off resistance among conservative elements of the ruling 
communists and the sigurimi the secret police 
alia also fired five hardline members of his ruling politburo 
police and troops moved into shkodra on thursday to deal with 
hundreds of hooligans who attacked officials and buildings

estimated 40000 ethnic greeks

forty western massachusetts fir trees 
were shipped to the persian gulf on friday after air force 
officials approved the christmas project 
the trees cut and packaged by volunteers and trimmings made by 
westfield school children were shipped out of westover air force 
base on a c5a transport plane said major richard dyer a base 
spokesman 
initially base officials were advised that the trees could not 
be sent to saudi arabia because the saudis might object to the 
christian symbols dyer said 
we were wrong dyer said when we determined that there 
was no religious prohibition by the saudi government we thought we 
could ship them over there and deliver them fresh 
dyer blamed the temporary grounding on conflicting guidance 
the base is the main staging area in the northeast for transport 
planes flying men and equipment to saudi arabia 
the fir trees were carefully wrapped in plastic to keep them 
fresh and packaged in cardboard tubes donated by a westfield 
company that uses the tubes as forms for poured concrete

government regulators seized control friday 
of the states largest savings and loan a thrift racked by bad 
real estate loans and allegations of fraud 
the federal office of thrift supervision placed comfed savings 
bank under control of the governments resolution trust corp 
officials from that agency will try to find buyers for comfeds 
assets said jonathan davis of resolution trust 
federal officials stressed the takeover did not interrupt 
comfeds daytoday operations and the thrifts 30 branches in 
massachusetts and connecticut will remain open for business as 
usual 
earlier this week the state closed new england allbank for 
savings in gardner transferring its operations to another bank 
comfed savings had been in deep trouble for months but 
regulators did not close it instead taking the interim step of 
placing it in conservatorship 
the thrifts trouble stemmed mostly from losses in its loan 
portfolio the government said the bank was hurt both by the 
declining real estate market and unsafe and unsound lending 
practices 
as of sept 30 comfeds delinquent loans totaled 219 million 
or 156 percent of total assets comfed reported assets of 14 
billion liabilities of 143 billion and tangible capital of 
negative 786 million 
comfeds losses totaled 1034 million for the nine months that 
ended sept 30 
comfed chairman jack zoeller said the thrifts financial 
troubles were compounded by fraud schemes carried out by former 
employees 
several exworkers who handled loans for comfed were convicted 
of fraud in october the federal government indicted 12 people in 
connection with a mortgage fraud scheme the defendants included 
two former comfed executives 
officials said the scheme exposed comfed to at least 12 million 
in losses

the senior engineer aboard an amtrak train that 
smashed into a commuter train injuring 264 people had been banned 
from operating trains in suburban new york because of signals 
violations authorities said friday 
willis copeland 53 of bethany conn was supervising an 
apprentice engineer at the controls of the night owl from 
washington that derailed and crashed as it approached a boston 
station during morning rushhour wednesday 
on march 27 copeland agreed to a lifetime ban from metronorth 
railroad the commuter railroad that serves new yorks northern 
suburbs after running two temporary stop signs in 1988 and in 
march said metronorth spokeswoman marjorie anders 
he also was at the controls of an amtrak train involved in a 
july 1984 crash that was blamed on a signal problem the national 
transportation safety board cleared him of wrongdoing 
apprentice engineer richard abramson 41 of trumbull conn 
and copeland were among eight people still hospitalized friday 
copeland was in stable condition after undergoing surgery for 
multiple injuries including a spinal fracture and abramson was in 
good condition with a broken collarbone 
ntsb vice chairwoman susan coughlin said a train driven by 
copeland derailed when he failed to stop before a drawbridge in new 
york state in february 1979 two months later copeland was 
involved in a yard derailment she said 
copeland was dismissed from conrail in december 1971 and 
reinstated six weeks later coughlin said the reason for the 
dismissal was unclear she said 
copeland was unable to comment because of his condition 
none of the signal violations while he worked for metronorth 
resulted in an accident 
federal safety officials said friday that although abramson 
reported that brake failure caused the train to derail underground 
near the back bay station the investigation into the cause of the 
crash is far from complete 
that is what he told our investigators said ntsb spokesman 
brent bahler however that has not been confirmed through any 
other interviews or information we have the investigation is still 
very much open 
the night owl derailed along a curve and crashed into a 
massachusetts bay transportation authority commuter train injuring 
264 people 
abramson told investigators he tried to brake the train three 
times as it approached the station 
he indicated that in his three attempts to brake the train 
the brakes failed to set up properly to stop it coughlin said 
thursday night 
ntsb officials said friday night it was possible the brakes on 
both amtrak locomotives failed but the brakes on the trains 
passenger cars were found to be working normally 
coughlin also said technicians were able to recover data from an 
amtrak recorder that had been erased that information will be 
analyzed in the next few days she said 
a tone had been recorded over portions of the tape covering the 
final minutes before the crash but coughlin said it was unclear 
whether that was an accident or had been done intentionally 
abramson had taken over operation of a regular train run for the 
first time this week authorities said 
bahler said that each car in a train has brakes and normally 
all are used to stop a train preliminary tests on the 
leastdamaged amtrak cars toward the rear of the train showed no 
brake failure 
however well be interested in determining the condition of 
the brakes on the front of the train bahler said 
amtrak spokesman cliff black said train brakes are tested and 
visually inspected upon departure and at every stop along a route 
this train had no problems with earlier stops or speed 
restrictions along the route indicating that the brakes were 
working black said adding that it was as yet unknown whether 
the brakes simply failed while entering boston 
it is within the realm of possibility that a brake problem 
could have occurred at that point but i dont know and im not 
going to pretend to speculate black said 
coughlin said speed could have been a factor although there was 
no way to determine the trains exact speed when it derailed data 
compiled from the station showed it averaged 918 mph during the 
last 1 miles before impact

musician jamey turners favorite 
instrument consists of 60 brandy snifters several jugs of water 
and a sturdy table accompanied by a silent prayer that it wont 
rain or freeze 
turner a 50yearold resident of this washington dc suburb 
earns his living playing water glasses as far as he knows hes 
the only fulltime professional water glass musician in the united 
states and one of very very few anywhere in the world 
simply by rubbing his wet fingers around the rims of glasses 
partially filled with water a trick he learned from his parents 
at the dining room table turner can produce some of the most 
ethereal music this side of heaven 
he has mesmerized audiences from boston common to san diegos 
balboa park with splayed hands that swoop in deft circles over his 
sparkling glasses coaxing them to sing sweetly from bach mozart 
gershwin or the beatles 
his musical theme song is the ode to joy from beethovens 
ninth symphony which affirms his belief in the brotherhood of 
mankind 
my music is part of my ministry says turner it lifts 
peoples spirits it helps them feel closer to god and gives them a 
sense of joy 
a former college instructor photographer and camera salesman 
turner has played the clarinet since he was a fifthgrader in rural 
montana about 15 years ago he turned to more unusual instruments 
he became a selftaught expert in the glass harp the musical 
saw and the wrench harp his own invention which features an 
assortment of household wrenches stretched on a wooden frame with 
fishing line it produces a wonderful chiming sound turner 
says 
he settled on the glass harp or musical water glasses and has 
been playing them ever since 
turner gives about 200 performances a year from street corners 
to concert halls he has appeared five times with the philadelphia 
orchestra as water glass soloist and twice with the national 
symphony orchestra 
hes played for tv network shows hospitals schools churches 
prisons corporate meetings weddings birthdays and bar mitzvahs 
for a blacktie reception at the corcoran gallery of art in 
washington and a catfish festival in mississippi he even dubbed 
the music for movie actor michael douglas water glass scene in 
the war of the rose 
lest anyone think they are musical oddities turner notes that 
water glasses were popular classical instruments in the late 18th 
and early 19th centuries 
mozart wrote two compositions for water glasses just before he 
died in 1792 and beethoven wrote several short serenades for the 
glass harmonica a mechanical version invented by benjamin 
franklin similar pieces were written by haydn gluck saintsaens 
and donizetti 
turner says he prefers brandy snifters because their curved 
shape provides a builtin resonating chamber that yields a 
rounder fuller sound than ordinary water tumblers he favors 
plain glass over leaded crystal which rings too long and has sharp 
edges that hurt his fingers 
i use only distilled water he said it gives me better 
friction on my fingers and it makes a lighter brighter sound than 
tap water 
squirting the water with a pair of oven basters turner spends 
about 15 minutes tuning his snifters which are strapped to a 
custombuilt wooden table with heavy rubber bands the notes 
correspond to nearly all the keys on the upper half of a piano 
an itinerate waterglass musician must contend with some 
frustrating hazards turner says 
in the arid southwest the notes gradually sharpen as the water 
evaporates if it rains the music goes flat in tampa fla one 
year a postchristmas cold snap almost froze turners instrument 
the high winds accompanying a sudden thunderstorm in new orleans 
almost overturned his table 
through it all turner says he is continually awed and humbled 
by his audiences emotional response to his music 
water glasses produce a very mellow genuinely sweet sound 
that seems to have a universal appeal turner says people find 
it very healing countless times i look up and see some people 
crying and nearly everyone smiling its a very joyous 
instrument 
after one bach performance before a sidewalk crowd he said a 
teenage boy came up in tears and whispered in my ear i dont 
have any money to put in your basket but you saved my life and 
he ran away he might have been contemplating suicide but ill 
never know 
a lighter moment occurred during a lunchtime recital on wall 
street when turner overheard one threepiece suit remark to 
another hes going to be very successful just look at those 
liquid assets

the ratings sweeps are over so you cant 
exactly accuse ted koppel of doing a report on sex this week to 
boost abcs nielsens 
but you can accuse him of doing a fine responsible job in the 
koppel report sex in the soviet union and of going beyond the 
old reliables porn prostitution and the baring of soviet bosoms 
for playboy magazine 
the thesis of koppels special which airs wednesday is that 
the uproars loosed by the new freedom of sex and expression in 
mikhail gorbachevs soviet union reflect far more profound changes 
convulsing that nation 
as koppel notes in his preface this is a program about 
political economic and moral problems as seen through the prism of 
sex in the soviet union 
this doesnt mean the onehour show is a dry recitation of those 
problems though far from it 
an advance look at an unfinished version of the show reveals 
some pictures you could call wowee shots even though abc 
says theyll be electronically altered before broadcast 
these include scenes of dancing barebreasted women who are 
part of a heavy metal act and a nude woman starting to put a 
condom on a nude man in a sex education film shown right there on 
soviet tv 
speaking of the latter koppel wryly notes that this still 
would be a nono here that what is now routinely shown on soviet 
state television has to be sanitized for american tv 
and its amusing to see soviet men crowded into a cramped 
basement videoklub one of a number of porn theaters now 
allowed avidly watching a softcore porn movie full of the usual 
gasps and heavy breathing 
but all this aside koppels expedition into soviet lives laws 
and morals under glasnost is a somber often sad trip despite the 
occasional side visit to places like the videoklub or the interview 
with a former soldier who now earns his way impersonating marilyn 
monroe 
the main stories koppel reports on the lack of privacy caused 
by housing shortages rampant divorce virtually no sex education 
a lack of contraceptive devices and an abortion rate he says is 
six times that of the united states one woman he interviews claims 
to have had nine abortions and her mother 19 
in his look at the worlds oldest profession sovietstyle 
koppel reports that prostitution is seen not as just a profitable 
venture it also is seen as a means of escape a chance to meet and 
marry western men who will take their ladies of the night from the 
soviet union 
aids is on the rise and a potential epidemic he finds and for 
the same reason it has spread in the united states promiscuity 
and ignorance 
new freedoms may abound but homosexuality remains a cause for 
furtive gatherings its still a crime punishable by up to three 
years in prison 
as one soviet official bluntly puts it homosexuality should be 
a crime because most people who are aids virus carriers are 
homosexuals 
much in the show has been reported on before but koppel and his 
troops do a firstrate job of putting it all into comprehensive 
context 
they dont always succeed notably in the closing chapter in 
which koppel tries to sort out the meaning of increasing public 
outrage that seems fairly divided 
one increasingly vocal camp is opposed to the new 
permissiveness the other demands more freedom for sexual 
minorities and far better treatment for women who the show 
reports remain secondclass citizens in all aspects of soviet 
life including employment 
koppels search for the cosmic conclusion to all this doesnt 
quite come off but no matter his show still is a solid 
wellcrafted documentary of the kind that have become a rarity at 
the big networks 
 
elsewhere in television 
lend an ear radio as old fuds know is tv without pictures 
sometimes it even makes you use your imagination case in point 
national public radios unique version of charles dickens a 
christmas carol taped for broadcast by npr stations during the 
holidays in it jonathan winters the wild man of many voices 
stars as scrooge and also is the voice of every other male 
character in the show even tiny tim the womenfolk all are played 
by mimi kennedy its an amazing feat by winters the only 
drawback he doesnt play it for laughs he actually plays it 
straight 
incidentally npr has had a brain wave aimed at helping those 
who dont know the dial location of their local public radio 
station just dial 2028222323 npr says the party at the other 
end will be more than glad to help

sen alan cranston defending himself against 
allegations of impropriety used props his audience could 
understand giant charts with the names of all senators and the 
aides they authorize to solicit campaign contributions 
if his help for big contributor charles h keating jr is judged 
improper cranston warned the senate ethics committee then every 
senator including every member of this committee had better run 
for cover because every senator has done it 
beyond the fates of the five senators the question posed by the 
keating hearings which resume this week is whether the 
embarrassment will be enough to shock congress into altering the 
system 
cranston dcalif and the other four senators who allegedly 
overstepped the bounds of propriety to help keating and his failed 
lincoln savings and loan are blaming the system while insisting 
they are innocent 
nowhere is the demand for changing the campaignfinancing law 
louder than among the accused 
it looks like hell said sen dennis deconcini dariz who 
with cranston faces the most serious allegations among the keating 
five quite frankly i dont want to have to go raise all the 
money and go through all of this consternation 
theres been little agreement in the committees four weeks of 
hearings except that congress itself has been tarnished by the 
experience the hearings have placed an intense spotlight on the 
relentless demands for money that are a part of congressional 
campaigns and a fulltime preoccupation for nearly every member of 
congress 
i think that the keating five is adding to the momentum for 
campaign finance reform said rep mike synar dokla who was 
shot down on the floor by house democrats earlier this year when he 
tried to gain house approval for a public campaignfinancing 
provision 
america is getting a noholdsbarred explanation of what 
really goes on in this campaignfinance system said fred 
wertheimer president of the lobbying group common cause and i 
think it is confirming their worst suspicions 
never mind the aides he said of cranstons charts the 
senators can be on the phone raising money from the very same 
people who come in to ask for help 
other members of the senate have rushed to blame the system 
what is corrupt said sen ernest hollings dsc is the 
system there is too darn much money required to seek and hold 
office 
congressional candidates spent 458 million in the 1988 
elections all reports arent in yet for the 1990 races but the 
figure is likely to be about the same perhaps higher 
yet so far there has been no clear sign that the case of the 
keating five has provided the impetus for change that the watergate 
scandal created for public financing of presidential campaigns 
the house and the senate each passed bills this year aimed at 
limiting campaign spending and lessening the influence of 
specialinterest money on congressional elections 
but no compromise ever emerged and the bills died 
the more sweeping senate bill would have banned political action 
committee contributions and created partial public financing of 
congressional campaigns the house version would have created 
voluntary spending limits 
senate majority leader george mitchell a supporter of public 
financing says changing the law remains a top priority of senate 
democrats in the new congress 
house speaker tom foleys support for some form of 
campaignspending law change has been considered suspect by many 
proponents however and house democrats have been reluctant to 
change a system that reelects incumbents at a rate of 96 percent 
or better 
they figure that spending limits would help incumbents by 
limiting challengers ability to compete but that limits on 
contributions could reduce the advantage of incumbency 
with the scandals of former speaker jim wright and democratic 
whip tony coelho the last congress provided a good opportunity 
but one that fell short still some are optimistic that foleys 
maturing leadership and the keating case may make a difference 
the keating five situation is a reflection of the kinds of 
problems that occur when you refuse to fix a situation that is 
broke said synar he predicted passage of campaignfinance 
legislation in the first quarter of the next session which 
begins jan 3 
the keating case is not one of a typical campaign contributor 
but the 13 million he contributed or raised for the causes and 
campaigns of the five senators demonstrates how existing limits on 
contributions can be circumvented 
much of that money 850000 went to voterregistration efforts 
supported by cranston and was not covered by existing limits other 
contributions were raised by keating from his employees and 
associates and cranston had available to his reelection campaign 
but did not use a 300000 line of credit from lincoln 
the possibilities for corruption inherent in a system that 
demands endless fund raising were noted by the ethics committees 
special counsel robert s bennett increased demands for money 
combined with increasing demands on congress from constituents 
create a booming warning bennett said 
unless these trends are recognized and dealt with we will 
have more cases like this and the reputation of this body and its 
members will be in ruins he said

john gabos had hoped to strike it rich this 
christmas with a gimmick designed to symbolically turn the tables 
on japan but his japan land owners kit has put him about 100000 
in the hole 
so much for yankee ingenuity 
ive had trouble gabos said i could tell you ive sold 
thousands of them but i havent 
a barcode scanning equipment salesman by day gabos has been 
shut out in his attempt to gain retail shelf space for his 
moonlighting project triangular cardboard boxes holding membership 
certificates to the preferred japanese land owners club 
own a piece of japan the boxes urge 
convinced that americans were feeling overpowered by the 
increasing japanese economic presence in the united states the 
31yearold gabos bet a large chunk of his life savings on the 
notion that 1 million consumers would spend 12 to 14 each to 
belong to a club which owns tiny piece of idle farmland in 
hokkaido the least densely populated prefecture of japan 
gabos bought the plot for about 50000 the club owns the land 
as a group but club members dont hold individual ownership rights 
and have restricted use privileges they are prohibited from 
building hunting camping or removing soil rocks vegetation or 
anything else 
by middecember gabos and his wife christine had sold about 
100 units mostly to friends and through direct mail others from 
the first printing run of 10000 units are gathering dust 
the couple has tried to build awareness of the product through 
the news media with limited success now they are considering 
several advertising options 
it could very well be a turkey if he hasnt sold it to any 
major retailers yet pet rock inventor gary dahl saidhes 
blown it for this year 
dahl has reviewed more than 5000 gimmicks since selling 15 
million pet rocks in the 1975 christmas season 
had gabos been able to offer the gimmick to retailers a few 
weeks sooner than oct 15 they may have been more open to the 
idea he said but there were delays closing the real estate deal 
gabos said he found himself in a catch 22 situation wherein 
retailers would pledge to buy the kits if other stores successfully 
carried them 
gabos said the endeavor surprised a lot of his friends because 
he considers himself a conservative guy but his employer neal 
johnson of dataserv inc a barcode scanning concern in suburban 
eden prairie minn said the getrichquick scheme didnt shock 
him 
hes often told me he just wants to find a way to make a buck 
apiece out of a million people to become a millionaire johnson 
said hes a tremendously talented individual guy 
i havent given up hope gabos said this isnt a thing 
that will be obsolete after christmas i honestly believe it will 
sell out 
christine gabos said shes confident they will eventually break 
even at least but even if they lose money she said they will have 
no regrets 
the 100000 they spent came from stocks bonds and other 
savings they said john gabos said they probably will keep the 
land after the club expires but he said he has no specific plans 
for it legally he cant sell it until the year 2000 when the club 
and its memberships expire

china is huge and ancient a place of mystery 
and fascination even the chores and trials of daily life can be 
inscrutable as the writer discovered when she was assigned to the 
ap bureau in beijing

the driver wove through congested traffic veered 
around muledrawn wagons and passed with cabbageladen trucks that 
dated from world war ii 
a woman carrying a large basket of produce stepped directly in 
front of the car the driver braked swerved blasted the horn the 
woman stared as we passed her bicycles crisscrossing in our wake 
i had just arrived to take up residence in beijing and made a 
mental note that a drive across town should not be approached 
lightly 
there is much for an outsider to learn in the worlds most 
populous country from its ancient past to its complex modern 
politics 
it remains unique despite increased contact with the outside 
and entices the curious to explore 
villagers welcome foreigners warmly giving directions to the 
most scenic spots nearby sometimes even inviting them home for a 
meal on a long train ride chinese travelers will chat at length 
with outsiders over tea 
in china evem the ordinary can be exotic sometimes after a 
wind storm from the north it seems as if half the gobi desert has 
been deposited on the floors furniture and windowsills of a 
beijing apartment 
beijing is heated by coal and its air is thick with the residue 
you can tell how long someone has been in the capital it is said 
by the severity and frequency of the persons cough 
a newcomer must apply for a health certificate those who are 
prepared bring letters from doctors back home chest xrays and 
copies of laboratory reports certifying they have no communicable 
diseases 
getting chinese officials to accept the papers is the challenge 
the canny applicant places a chop or official stamp on every 
piece of paper to lend an air of authority 
after some wrangling the hospital official agreed to accept my 
xray more discussion was needed to avoid paying the xray fee 
even though no xray would be taken 
by this time a crowd had gathered to hear the discussion which 
alternated between chinese and english as each of us used whichever 
seemed best suited to the point at issue 
finally the health official had dropped all but one demand she 
insisted i have a blood test for syphilis 
a new york doctor had given me a letter saying i had no venereal 
diseases but the official declared syphilis is not a venereal 
disease 
i submitted to the test paid the fee and left wondering 
whether the entire process was designed just to collect foreign 
currency 
foreign exchange is in great demand and having it provides 
options but its all a bit confusing because the local currency 
comes in two varieties one for foreigners and one for chinese 
renminbi the nonconvertible currency used by chinese is 
officially unavailable to foreigners they are supposed to use 
foreign exchange certificates or fec 
when i went to make my first household purchase a kettle for 
boiling drinking water i had only fec and the price was in 
renminbi fec has a higher street value so i asked the clerk to 
lower the price 
onlookers clustered around for the bargaining some joined in 
helping me persuade the woman to offer a foreign money price 
so she asked for dollars no i was offering fec pretty soon 
she was quoting three prices renminbi fec or dollars 
much too complicated i thought so i left to think it over 
when i returned the next day all the kettles were gone 
part of the fun of bargaining is that when the bargainer is 
foreign it becomes instant street theater passersby love to 
watch and offer advice especially if the foreigner bargains in 
chinese 
the polite parting line is always you speak very good 
chinese however good or bad it may have been 
foreigners get used to stares on the street but official 
surveillance is another matter 
cameras record all comings and goings at the walled compounds 
where most foreigners must live there are more subtle reminders of 
probing eyes like tea stains on newspaper clippings from a friend 
in the united states who doesnt drink tea 
foreign reporters seem the most closely watched and the most 
resentful of it which creates a mutual animosity that isnt always 
hidden 
at foreign ministry briefings spokesmen often refuse to answer 
questions and rebuke those who demand answers reporters counter 
with derisive laughter 
a dutch journalist asked whether a new government campaign to 
improve chinas image would mean greater access to leaders and more 
complete answers to questions 
colleagues laughed anticipating an ironic or sarcastic reply 
no comment the spokeswoman said

when the roman catholic church turned the jewish 
catacombs over to italy leaders of the wests oldest jewish 
community thought they would be as popular with tourists as the 
christian catacombs on the appian way 
more than five years later most tourists still dont know the 
jewish catacombs exist those who do have to brave romes 
bureaucracy for permission to visit them 
plans to make the jewish catacombs safe and easy to visit fell 
victim to a government budget that is chronically short of money 
even to care for archaeological sites already open to the public 
all the plans are ready said nicoletta pagliardi of romes 
superintendency of archaeology we could do it tomorrow but the 
funds are used up we have to wait for next years budget 
disappointed but determined italian jews have turned to private 
groups last spring the world monuments fund began raising money 
for a scientific survey of what must be done to make the catacombs 
suitable for visits 
the catacombs used in the first three or four centuries after 
christ are a unique documentation of jewish life of a religious 
minority which lived in imperial rome said tullia zevi 
president of the union of italian jewish communities 
burial spaces like narrow berths in a railroad sleeper car 
were carved in soft tufa stone one atop the other inscriptions on 
marble slabs that covered the niches are the main source of 
information about the ancient jews mrs zevi said 
inscriptions indicate the jews prayed mainly in greek and spoke 
in latin many apparently were ordinary people artisans or 
merchants but there also were bankers magistrates actors and 
other professionals 
on the walls of the catacombs are stunning images of menorahs 
the sevenarmed candelabra peacocks and pomegranates symbolizing 
fertility 
nearly all the inscriptions now reside in the vaticans museums 
and storerooms the vatican took charge of the jewish catacombs 
after their discovery more than 100 years ago before the modern 
italian state was created because it was the only organization 
with the means to excavate them 
an estimated 4000060000 jews lived in ancient italy compared 
to todays total of about 3500040000 a synagogue at ostia 
antica romes ancient port may be the oldest monotheistic temple 
in europe 
of romes six known jewish catacombs four collapsed or were 
built upon in the last centuries 
the fifth is on property of a private villa near the appia 
antica and the sixth on the grounds of villa torlonia now a city 
park where dictator benito mussolini lived for 20 years mussolini 
signed the 1929 lateran pacts that gave the vatican control of all 
catacombs 
to see the jewish catacombs a visitor must apply in person for 
a permit at the superintendency of archaeology 
if a person comes to rome for a weekend theyll be gone by 
the time they get a permit mrs zevi said 
nearly all requests are from scholars or jewish groups 
pagliardi said and its rare when an ordinary tourist hears 
about the catacombs 
mrs zevi said she realizes it will not be possible to match the 
hours of the christian catacombs which are open morning and 
afternoon six days a week and have thousands of visitors villa 
torlonia for example can accommodate only about 10 people at a 
time 
jewish groups would be content to see the catacombs open to the 
public at least one set day a week mrs zevi said 
the world monuments fund favors making the jewish catacombs more 
accessible but worries that tourists might damage them by 
brushing against a frescoed wall innocently introducing bacteria 
even just by breathing said samuel gruber director of the funds 
jewish heritage council 
pagliardi said christian catacombs have been damaged by 
excessive numbers of visitors and the state wants to save the 
jewish catacombs from a similar fate 
electrical wiring has been installed in the first 100 yards of 
the halfmilelong passageway at villa torlonia but much remains 
to be done when it rains archaeologists place blocks of wood near 
the entrance to serve as stepping stones through ankledeep water 
the reward for going in is a chance to stand for a few minutes 
in a room that testifies to the jews strong feelings for their 
faith a menorah fresco decorates the vaulted ceiling and a rolled 
scroll representing the torah is painted near the entryway 
other frescoes include dolphins palm leaves and the ark of the 
covenant four tufa columns in the corners are painted to look like 
marble

when the stock market script for 1991 starts to 
play out in a couple of weeks one familiar element will be missing 
narration by monte gordon 
the 67yearold gordon one of wall streets most widely quoted 
analysts on the ups and downs of the world of finance retires dec 
31 after 18 years as research director at the moneymanagement firm 
of dreyfus corp 
gordons bespectacled face became a fixture in television 
coverage of the stock market all through the turbulent 1980s 
long before that he was well known to newspaper reporters and 
many of their readers as an everavailable source of market 
information and analysis often served up in a style that might be 
called unabashed baroque 
a vintage gordonism delivered on what others might have thought 
of as just a dull day on wall street the market is languishing 
in the shadow of its own worries 
over a career of more than four decades he previously worked 
at what is now prudentialbache securities gordon says he has 
kept an abiding fascination with the financial markets 
its always exhilarating and never the same from one day to 
the next he told a visitor to his 55thfloor office in 
midmanhattan you never lose the zest for this 
asked how his job has changed over time gordon immediately 
pointed to todays instant communications systems embodied by 
computer screens with instantbyinstant charts of market activity 
there was a time when if you wanted to know what was going on 
you had to call a broker on the floor of the exchange he said 
all that has changed with the structure of the flow of 
information 
given shortened reaction times in what has become a worldwide 
business and the development of such techniques as 
computerprogram trading is the market more volatile now than it 
used to be 
it has more potential for volatility its like a coiled 
spring gordon observed but the basic verities of what is a 
good stock what is a good company havent changed 
a dark moment in recent wall street history the crash of 1987 
provided a high spot in gordons memory of his years of market 
forecasting right after the break i said buy em going on 
experience and instinct he recalls that was fun 
after the 80s which he describes as a time of great 
innovation and vitality gordon acknowledges that stocks and wall 
street are now paying part of the price for past euphoria 
while that may continue for a while he says eventually the 
stock market of the 90s is going to be strong different from 
the 80s but strong 
for the typical individual investor in late 1990 he recommends 
committing about 60 percent of assets to stockrelated investments 
30 percent to bonds and 10 percent to moneymarket vehicles he 
doesnt counsel waiting for the economic outlook to clear before 
putting the money to work 
remember he says we started the 80s with the recession 
of 198182 if you wait for somebody to ring a bell or blow a 
whistle before you invest its too late 
after years of being consulted and scrutinized by reporters he 
was asked how does he appraise the way broadcasters and the press 
cover the markets 
the coverage is better now much more knowledgeable and much 
more detailed he says theres a tendency toward hype 
overdramatizing whats going on but the quality and extent of the 
coverage is much improved

occidental petroleum corp without armand hammer 
becomes a takeover target henson associates inc without muppet 
creator jim henson loses its appeal to walt disney co 
the lessons of the past week clearly demonstrate the value of 
human assets in american business 
on tuesday shares of occidental leaped 9 percent as investors 
began to speculate on the corporations life after hammers death 
at age 92 for years conventional wisdom held that the company 
would restructure or be acquired once hammer departed 
hammer dominated the company and built it into the nations 16th 
largest corporation along the way the company racked up big debts 
and paid out healthy dividends to shareholders as it acquired 
interests in a variety of businesses including energy chemicals 
and meat packing 
without its strongwilled chief the company could narrow its

rooted in a valuation of the late hensons own talent and 
influence 
when disney and henson announced an agreement in principle for 
the two creative empires to merge 18 months ago disney was 
figuring henson himself into the mix as much as kermit the frog and 
miss piggy 
when henson died unexpectedly in may the proposed combination 
lost some luster 
hensons estate kept pushing for top dollar but minus the

uncertainty also continued to plague the oil world opec agreed 
at its winter strategy meeting in vienna austria to keep pumping 
oil in excess of established quotas at least until the persian 
gulf crisis is resolved 
ignoring the quotas could lead to an eventual glut of oil but 
the money has been too good to pass up during the crisis 
ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries did get assurances from superproducer saudi arabia and 
others to trim production once the crisis ends 
market traders of oil were likewise on the fence oil touched 
lows at midweek not seen since the early days of the crisis but 
rose again at weeks end over worries that diplomatic efforts aimed 
at ending the crisis were faltering at 265027 per barrel the 
price of crude still had a 5 war premium built in 
a government report said energy prices on the wholesale level 
moderated during november but inflation was still percolating at a 
69 percent annual rate up from 49 percent last year

tough times and global competition have forced 
radical changes in the us workplace companies are using new 
incentives to make employees more productive and labor and 
management are working together the final part of a threepart 
series the new workplace details how one archenemy japanese 
steel now is being courted in joint ventures with struggling us 
steel firms 
 
</TEXT>

they are competitors turned 
confidantes two corporate giants one american one japanese who 
have joined hands here call it a marriage of convenience or call 
it the future of steel 
either way its accurate inland steel co and nippon steel 
corp have formed a 1 billion partnership in these corn fields 
building a 10story 21st century mill that symbolizes the changing 
look of the industry 
big steel in the 90s means big partnerships the united states 
and japan old rivals have become new allies each looking to 
profit as they breathe life into an industry flat on its back for 
much of the last decade 
the japanese are helping rebuild our steel industry and we 
should not be upset by that said richard florida a management 
and public policy professor at carnegie melon university the 
japanese get access to the american markets americans get the 
technology and good jobs its a winwinwin situation 
its a marriage for money not love 
the japanese have poured about 7 billion into single or joint 
steel ventures almost all in the late 80s florida said 
kawasaki sumitomo kobe and nippon the worlds largest 
steelmaker are putting down roots on the industrial landscape 
welcomed by such american stalwarts as armco ltv usx and inland 
inlandnippons in tek the worlds most modern coldrolling 
steel mill and in kote a galvanizing facility that coats steel 
together have a 1 billion price tag 
the partnerships seem an odd twist considering that imports 
along with the strong dollar and recession contributed to 
americas steel decline in the 1980s japan was the no 1 foreign 
supplier through the decade american companies bitterly complained 
about japanese dumping 
theres a big irony to it said john jacobson of aus 
consultants in suburban philadelphia many of the us companies 
have just had to grin and bear it theyve really had to change 
their perception of the world 
have we given up control certainly he said us 
management does not control its destiny like it used to but its 
destiny wasnt all that good their prospects have improved with 
their investment its better to have half of something good than 
all of something bad 
steel indeed was in crisis in the early to mid80s mills 
closed towns died the work force shrank by hundreds of thousands 
the industry lost 12 billion from 1982 to 1986 though it since 
has rebounded 
it was a fat overweight industry that ran into a wall and 
ended up in the hospital for a few years jacobson said now it 
seems to be back on a better diet slimmed down a little more 
competitive 
the japanese interest is largely spurred by the desire to sell 
steel to the growing number of japanese auto companies in this 
country in tek for example sells to four honda toyota 
chryslermitsubishi subaruisuzu 
these partnerships are just part of a nationwide japanese 
investment explosion some 1100 manufacturing plants with a 
japanese majority interest were established or under construction 
in the united states by the end of 1988 the japan economic 
institute reported last year 
japanese companies have invested more than 25 billion in 
rubber autos auto suppliers and steel florida said 
that way the japanese avoid the expense of building new mills 
alone and reduce political risks by buying off us producers 
who receive both upfront cash and a share of ongoing profits 
said a study cowritten by florida this year 
these investments florida notes also provide a solution to 
trade barriers that limit the amount of steel that can be imported 
the current level is 195 percent of the us market 
still some bemoan the trend 
the japanese look far out into the future said tom jones a 
staff representative for the united steelworkers of america my 
concern is american management is so devoted to immediate 
returns to stockholders or the shortterm bottom line that unless 
were very careful the japanese will simply one day wake up and 
have them all for breakfast 
inland needed help after a disastrous string of years starting 
with 1982s loss of 119 million the first fullyear loss since 
the depression three more bad years followed with losses totaling 
336 million 
by the mid80s about 30 percent of inlands facilities were 
obsolete and the steelmaker was hearing it couldnt match the 
quality of imports said frank luerssen chairman and chief 
executive of inland steel industries inc the parent company 
times were so terrible that inland sold its chicago 
headquarters 
but there was hope nippons chairman already had expressed 
interest in a joint project and as a potential mate the japanese 
company had an attractive dowry lots of money and sophisticated 
technology 
after luerssen saw nippons continuous coldrolling mill turn 
out steel coils faster and smoother than ever during a japan visit 
in 1984 he decided inland needed one to be competitive 
initially the steelmaker planned to buy the technology and 
equipment and own the mill but it was clear it couldnt do that 
financially 
workers knew it too 
we saw the business go away we saw the number of employees 
continue to shrink said paul rausch president of local 9231 at 
in tek who formerly worked at inlands steelmaking plant 
indiana harbor works the labor force at indiana harbor dropped 
from 24500 to 14500 during the last decade 
in 1987 after protracted negotiations the inlandnippon 
partnership was announced inland has 60 percent of the 
partnership nippon 40 percent japanese lenders provided the bulk 
of the money to build the plant which started production this 
spring 
in tek the nations only continuous coldrolling mill uses a 
process that slashes production time from 12 days to less than an 
hour with a third of the workers 
this is the 21st century mill we just built it early said 
george landsly manager of administration 
it is a hightech marvel computer rooms resemble air traffic 
control towers human hands rarely touch steel backbreaking chores 
are performed by machines that look like props from the 
terminator 
and the product is premiumquality steel made from coils an lsqb 
of a inch thick and 65 inches wide that are cleaned compressed 
softened flattened and finished then inspected to meet orders for 
cars appliances and office furniture 
you get a uniform product over and over again landsly said 
its almost like making cookies one at a time or making a batch 
together where they all taste the same

a new cancer treatment using genetically 
engineered molecules that aim extremely high doses of radiation at 
cancerous tissue may double doctors ability to destroy some 
cancers researchers say 
scientists at the fred hutchinson cancer research center are 
using the techniques to deliver the highest doses of radiation ever 
directed at human cancer tissue in an attempt to cure 
by attaching radioisotopes to monoclonal antibodies and 
injecting them into patients widespread cancers can be destroyed 
with massive amounts of radiation that otherwise would be fatal 
antibodies are proteins formed by the bodys immune system to 
fight foreign substances or antigens monoclonal antibodies are 
genetically identical molecules usually developed in mice that 
can be targeted at cancer cells 
the hutchinson radiolabeling research is unique in that the 
scientists are using antibodies to which more radiation in the 
form of radioisotopes has been attached than those used by any 
other group 
researchers are still testing to find the highest level of 
radioisotopes that can be used said irwin bernstein a professor 
of pediatric oncology at the center and the university of 
washington 
we hope to deliver twice the amount of radiation and thus be 
twice as efficient in destroying the cancer cells said rainer 
storb a program director in transplantation biology 
the researchers believe the procedures will enable them to treat 
some advanced solid tumor cancers as well as leukemias and 
lymphomas 
the research is being done in collaboration with the university 
of washington and is supported by grants from the national 
institutes of health 
the trials are an outgrowth of the work of dr e donnall 
thomas who performed the first human bone marrow transplant in 
1956 and was awarded the nobel prize this year thomas is assistant 
director of clinical research programs at the hutchinson center 
the radiolabeling treatment was developed because some lymphoma 
and leukemia patients whose cancers were killed beyond detection 
using standard bone marrow transplants had recurrences 
the patients in the immunotherapy trials have malignant diseases 
for which transplantation is the only cure 
for lymphomas radiolabeling has been used without additional 
radiation or chemotherapy while for leukemias it has been used in 
conjunction with the more standard transplant procedures 
that involves removing a patients bone marrow administering 
massive fullbody doses of radiation and chemotherapy sometimes 
greater than the amount given off by the chernobyl nuclear accident 
and reinjecting the marrow bone marrow is killed by high doses 
of radiation 
over the past two years 11 patients have been treated for 
lymphomas with monoclonal antibodies radiolabeled with as much as 
onehalf curie of i131 a level of radiation that would be fatal 
if the injection was not followed by a marrow transplant 
but even at lower doses no sign of the cancer could be detected 
after treatment in most patients bernstein said 
three of the patients have had longterm remissions while the 
rest are in treatment or have relapsed 
five leukemia patients have been given the new treatment in 
clinical trials that began last year it is too early to reach any 
conclusions for those patients said fred applebaum another 
transplant program director 
another research project at the center is using monoclonal 
antibodies to sift healthy stem cells in bone marrow from cancerous 
cells in patients with solid tumor cancers that have spread widely 
stem cells are precursors for white and red blood cells and 
platelets 
white blood cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies made 
in mice and goats the resulting sandwich monoclonal antibody 
binds to the normal stem cells when they are passed through a 
column said researcher william bensinger 
the technique allows the blood to be cleansed of any cancerous 
cells which may not be killed by radiation and chemotherapy the 
treated cells are reinjected to replace the patients bone marrow 
nine patients with very advanced breast cancers and three with 
neuroblastomas tumors that usually afflict children have been 
treated using the technique one breast cancer and one 
neuroblastoma patient have survived 
the others died of reactions to the chemotherapy or radiation or 
of relapse bensinger said 
he said he was unaware of similar experiments by other 
researchers 
the treatment has the potential to get rid of tumor cells and 
ultimately may be a better way to get rid of tumor cells in bone 
marrow bensinger said 
the hutchinson center is the worlds largest cancer treatment 
center using bone marrow transplants it performs about 400 of them 
annually 
research using monoclonal antibodies is also being conducted at 
the national institutes of health in washington dc the 
danafarber cancer institute in boston johns hopkins in baltimore 
and the cancer chemotherapy center in tokyo among others

east and west took big strides toward a lasting 
peace in 1990 after four decades of nuclear enmity but civil 
strife and allout war still convulsed corners of the world from 
liberia to south africa from sri lanka to the soviet republics 
as the year ends the greatest conflagration may lie just over 
the horizon the showdown between us and allied forces in saudi 
arabia and the iraqi invaders of kuwait 
iraqi president saddam hussein sent his battlehardened army 
into neighboring kuwait on aug 2 and quickly took control of the 
oilrich emirate president bush responded by deploying hundreds of 
thousands of american troops to the persian gulf region as part of 
a multinational defense force 
a un resolution authorized the use of force to oust iraq from 
kuwait if baghdad does not withdraw its army by jan 15 saddam 
showed no inclination to leave 
throughout 1990 washington and moscow worked to reduce the 
nuclear and conventional arsenals they spent 45 years amassing to 
confront each other but the middle east conflict threatened the 
peace dividend both sides hoped would rescue their slumping 
economies 
in europe soviet troops began pulling back from poland 
czechoslovakia hungary and east germany after noncommunist 
governments came to power in those nations for the first time since 
the end of world war ii 
leaders of the united states canada and all european nations 
except albania gathered in november and signed the charter of 
paris uniting them in a commitment to democracy and economic 
cooperation 
but ethnic tensions long suppressed under communist rule 
triggered violence in eastern europe romanians clashed with 
hungarians in disputed areas of romania and simmering ethnic 
conflicts and separatist demands threatened to dissolve yugoslavia 
in the soviet union all 15 of the nations republics took 
advantage of mikhail gorbachevs open policies to seek sovereignty 
from the central government 
ethnic and nationalist tensions in the soviet south led to

people with genetic defects he was off by four years but the

system disorder was given an infusion of genetically engineered 
cells intended to correct her genetic disease

district in milwaukee was school choices most potent champion in 
1990 
fed up with inadequate funding and an entrenched school 
bureaucracy state rep annette polly williams sponsored a 
firstofitskind voucher plan that sent 400 poor children to 
private schools with state money 
teacher unions and others in the educational establishment have 
warned that plans like milwaukees could seriously harm public 
education 
but the 53yearold williams has sided with bush in arguing that 
competition is exactly the jolt needed to improve public schools 
theres a belief among the bureaucrats in the public school 
system that as long as youre poor youre not expected to 
achieve said williams a democrat who has represented her

despite recent layoffs and cutbacks that have 
created apprehension among reporters dow jones amp co employees 
voted down a proposal to affiliate with a major union 
reporters technicians clerical workers and other personnel 
voted 61 percent to 39 percent against affiliating with the 
communications workers of america an aggressive union that staged 
four strikes last year 
organizers said thursday they were unable to capitalize on a 
mood of anger and fear over recent layoffs bureau closings and 
other cutbacks at the wall street journal the business newspaper 
published by dow jones 
in essence we were saying that we have a fairweather union 
and we are going into rough weather said ron chen a journal 
copy editor and president of an inhouse union the independent 
association of publishers employees that message apparently did 
not get across 
a total of 1074 of 1800 members of the inhouse union which 
had supported affiliation participated in the vote rejecting it 
by 655 to 419 dow jones employs 9800 
dow jones president peter r kann said he was gratified by 
the vote he said it suggested workers didnt see what additional 
benefit affiliation with a large union would bring to the 
employees or the company 
dow jones management had lobbied against the proposal saying in 
a letter to employees that their union dues would triple for some 
workers by 1993 and that only 45 percent of the cwas membership 
were publishing employees 
dow jones hurt by the recession in the securities and 
publishing industries recently announced it was closing the 
journals philadelphia bureau and laid off reporters in los 
angeles houston vancouver british columbia new dehli india 
brussels belgium and seoul south korea 
at least 10 senior employees either have been forced or lured 
into accepting early retirement buyouts several reporters said 
they are fearful of further cuts and angered by the way dow jones 
handled the layoffs 
if you had a circumstance you thought would play to our 
strength it was job security said douglas r sease a journal 
financial markets reporter and head of the inhouse unions 
bargaining committee obviously we didnt get the kind of support 
we thought we were going to get 
leaders of the inhouse union had argued that affiliation would 
bring professional instead of parttime representation during a 
difficult period 
but employees said they were swayed in large part by the dues 
increase and union choice the cwa which has 700000 members is 
trying to expand in the newspaper industry in addition to 
communications workers and newspaper production employees the 
union represents editorial workers at several papers in the nited 
states and canada 
theyre not known as a strong newspaper union and i didnt see 
what they could do for the editorial employees said one reporter 
who rejected affiliation and asked not to be named

the chorus of media companies singing the 
earnings blues because of the advertising slump is growing louder 
every day 
gannett co inc which publishes usa today and 81 other daily 
newspapers said thursday the slump will drag down revenues and 
possibly earnings in 1990 
the declines would be the first such yeartoyear drops at 
gannett since the company went public 22 years ago and reflect what 
experts say has been the slowest annual growth in overall ad 
spending since 1975 
the arlington vabased media concern was among a halfdozen 
media companies that described for securities analysts the toll 
that the weak advertising environment is taking on their earnings 
expectations 
the only question to ask is how much worse are things going 
to get richard d simmons president of the washington post co 
told the annual painewebber media outlook conference 
to varying degrees the slump was also cited for expectations of 
either earnings declines or slower growth at the new york times 
co affiliated publications inc and dow jones amp co ah belo 
corp said the ad slump would mean lower earnings at least in the 
first part of 1991 
gannett which also has interests in television radio and 
outdoor advertising expects revenue of 34 billion to 35 
billion in 1990 said douglas mccorkindale vice chairman and chief 
financial officer that would be down from 352 billion a year 
ago 
mccorkindale did not predict earnings for the year but noted 
that many analysts were estimating profits at 235 a share down 
from 247 a share in 1989 he told the group that estimate seems 
reasonable and cautioned against guessing much more it would be 
its first such profit decline as well 
the company also hinted that usa today may fall short in 1990 of 
posting its first profitable year as publisher cathleen black said 
ad volume fell 75 percent while ad revenue edged up 14 percent 
nonetheless john j curley chairman president and chief 
executive said usa today will decide by yearend on launching a 
weekly sports tabloid 
at the washington post simmons said earnings per share will 
drop to 1425 in 1990 from 1550 in 1989 and decline again in 
1991 
he said the soft advertising market produced doubledigit 
declines in classified and retail advertising volume in the 
flagship washington post and that three of the companys four tv 
stations would have lower results 
walter mattson president and chief operating officer at the 
times said earnings from continuing operations would be between 80 
cents and 90 cents a share in 1990 compared with 87 cents a share a 
year ago he said earnings would be lower in 1991 but declined to 
be more specific 
mattson said he expects an 8 percent decline in ad volume at the 
times that ad rates will rise about 65 percent and the company 
would try to boost circulation revenue he declined to comment on 
whether prices would be raised 
results from the companys 35 regional newspapers will be up 
next year he said while magazines will have a smaller operating 
loss and operating results from broadcasting and information 
services will be flat 
william taylor chairman of bostonbased affiliated 
publications said he expected earnings from continuing operations 
would be down significantly in 1990 from 63 cents a share in 1989 
and flat in 1991 he did not elaborate but industry analysts have 
estimated earnings at 35 cents to 40 cents a share 
he said the company intends to raise the price of daily copies 
of the boston globe to 50 cents from 35 cents in areas 30 miles 
outside the city 
dow jones publisher of the wall street journal and owner of the 
telerate information services company said it expects earnings 
will fall to 102 to 106 a share from 152 a share in 1989 
excluding a onetime gain 
peter kann president and chief operating officer said business 
was pretty lousy with financial advertising off sharply and 
demand for telerate machines at thrifts and brokerages down 
the company adopted a costcontainment plan recently that is 
expected to hold expenditures to 1990 levels next year kenneth 
burenga general manager and senior vice president said the 
company expects to have 400 fewer employees at yearend than it at 
the start of 1990 when it employed about 10000 
the cuts include about 150 employees of the journal he said 
also thursday dow jones employees rejected a move to affiliate 
with a big communications workers union by a vote of 61 percent to 
39 percent the company had opposed the affiliation 
belo the dallasbased newspaper and broadcasting company 
expects higher earnings this year but the ad slump will mean lower 
earnings in early 1991 
james p sheehan president and chief operating officer said 
analysts have estimated that it will earn 135 to 145 a share in 
1990 and said the company will be in that range before a 
special onetime gain

selfperpetuating downward cycle said senior economist tom webb 
of the national automobile dealers association in mclean va 
the 10 major automakers building cars and trucks in north 
america said thursday their vehicles sold at an average daily rate 
of 27624 during the dec 110 period compared with a rate of 
22589 during the same time last year 
car sales were up 278 percent and truck sales rose 143 percent 
during the period compared with a year ago which was the weakest 
selling period of 1989 
sales of domestically made cars by general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp rose 293 percent compared with 
yearago levels while sales of north american built cars with 
japanese company nameplates increased 142 percent 
the big three held 91 percent of the domestic car market 
the seemingly large increase didnt impress auto analyst mary 
anne sudol of fitch investors service inc in new york 
the news out of motown is not too terrific she said 
consumers are putting rubber bands over their wallets and cutting 
up their plastic credit cards 
a more accurate picture emerges from the sales rate for the 
entire year sales of north americanmade cars and trucks between 
jan 1 and dec 10 this year were running 31 percent behind last 
year with car sales down 31 percent and truck sales off 33 
percent 
the auto industry which has slipped into a recession watched 
its total sales plunge in november when fleet orders which had 
inflated october sales numbers dried up 
the comparisons are against a disastrous yearago period 
webb said true demand absent the artificial prop of fleet 
deals remains weak and our normally upbeat dealers are becoming 
almost as pessimistic as consumers 
one unusual number in thursdays reports was a 316 percent 
decline in sales of honda motor co ltds north americanmade 
cars spokesman mike spencer attributed the decline to the overall 
weakness in the industry for the entire year hondas sales are up 
223 percent against last year 
ford said its early december vehicle sales rose 325 percent 
buoyed by hefty increases of 322 percent and 326 percent 
respectively in car and truck sales ford spokesman joel pitcoff 
said a sales contest for dealers expired dec 10 
for the year fords combined car and truck sales were down 7 
percent 
gms 285 percent increase in early december car sales combined 
with an 116 percent rise in truck sales for a 222 percent 
increase in vehicle sales so far this year gms combined vehicle 
sales were running 37 percent below last years rate 
chrysler said a 132 percent decrease in its earlydecember 
truck sales rate was offset by a 254 percent rise in car sales 
resulting in a 47 percent increase in vehicle sales during the 
period this year over last year 
chryslers yeartodate car and truck sales were running 133 
percent behind last years rate

the dodge daytona shelby and dodge caravan are 
close in price but far apart when it comes to insurance costs 
according to one insurers annual rating of more than 200 domestic 
and foreign vehicles 
the staid caravan minivan is among the cheapest vehicles to 
insure in the 10000to15000 price range and the sporty shelby 
is among the costliest the allstate insurance co said thursday 
three other chrysler corp minivans the dodge grand caravan 
plymouth voyager turbo and plymouth grand voyager gt and the 
chrysler fifth avenue also ranked among the 10 models with much 
below average insurance costs in their respective price 
categories allstate said 
the list was rounded out by the subaru justy suzuki swift 
toyota tercel ford ltd wagon and the volvo 240 
in addition to the shelby some of the cars rated costliest to 
insure in their respective price classes were the ford escort gt 
geo tracker chevrolet camaro irocz and the bmw 750 series 
the ratings reflect the type of damage a car will suffer in a 
crash repair costs and the cars potential for theft and breakin 
allstate said in a statement from its headquarters in northbrook a 
chicago suburb 
allstate compiled the lists from its experience with collision 
and comprehensive claims on 1989 and 1990 model cars in 45 states 
vehicles with much below average insurance costs generally 
had ratings that were 25 percent to 30 percent below the average 
for their price group said allstate spokesman mike lamonica 
those with much above average costs had ratings that were 25 
percent to 50 percent above the average for their price group he 
said 
chryslers minivans were about 50 percent below average in the 
collision and comprehensive categories lamonica said 
he said the collision data indicate the vehicles withstand 
crashes better than others in their price categories the 
betterthanaverage experience with comprehensive insurance claims 
reflect relatively low theft and vandalism rates 
caravans and voyagers are just not popular theft items 
lamonica said 
demographics also factor into the ratings said allstate 
spokeswoman kathleen hogan owners of chrysler minivans for 
example might tend to be families who live in relatively lowcrime 
areas and drive carefully because they have children in the car 
she said 
chrysler the no 3 domestic automaker sells more minivans than 
another other manufacturer but its dominance is slipping 
chrysler has a tradition of working with insurers to design in 
features to make it easier for crash repair and protection said 
tom jakobowski a company spokesman

when the soviet union uses its new 1 billion 
credit line every us commodity group hopes it will be on the 
shopping list 
if they wanted to the soviets could use it to buy more than 400 
million bushels of us wheat which would be most of the entire 
kansas crop this year 
or all of the corn grown in ohio or all the soybeans produced 
in missouri and mississippi but there is also rice dairy products 
and dozens of other possibilities 
wheat could be the majority of it i would think said barry 
jenkins of the national association of wheat growers but theres 
going to be people lined up along with us 
soybeans and other commodities such as corn oats barley rice 
and dairy products also are clamoring for attention he said 
thursday 
we may have something going for us because they need some 
flour real quick jenkins said thats going to help and flour 
is a valueadded product that helps the wheat farmer and yet keeps 
some of the money home 
citing the tough times the difficult times facing the 
soviet people president bush announced wednesday he was waiving 
through june 1991 longstanding trade restrictions and handed 
moscow credit lines of 1 billion for farm products and 300 
million for manufactured goods 
ironically the grain trade had expected an even larger credit 
line for the soviets so the news of the 1 billion was bearish on 
the market 
grain futures were sharply lower thursday on the chicago board 
of trade one analyst said the credit package was disappointing and 
that traders had expected 15 billion to 3 billion the level 
urged earlier by sen bob dole rkan 
the agriculture department will work with soviet officials to 
decide details of the credit package including schedules for 
financing and repayment usda underwrites the loans which are made 
by private lenders under the departments export credit programs 
theoretically if a fourway split could be arranged with each 
interest group getting about 250 million of the pie it could mean 
the sale of about 105 million bushels of wheat based on a recent 
us farm price average of 239 per bushel 
actual selling prices would be higher than the farm prices 
however since transportation charges to move grain from inland 
points to port loading facilities must be computed too 
on the same basis a 250 million share would account for more 
than 114 million bushels of corn at an average farm price of 219 
per bushel 
about 45 million bushels of soybeans could bought for 250 
million at the recent average us farm price of 551 per bushel 
the remaining 250 million might be used to buy miscellaneous 
grains such as rice oats and barley dairy products meat and 
various processed food items 
the soviet union has been buying large quantities of us grain 
since the early 1970s in recent years the purchases have been 
under longterm agreements that commit both countries to minimum 
annual levels 
in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 the soviets bought 203 
million metric tons of us grain including almost 165 million 
tons of corn and 38 million tons of wheat 
that was the equivalent of 650 million bushels of corn and 140 
million bushels of wheat roughly 14 billion worth of corn at 
todays farm prices and 335 million worth of wheat 
in all last years farm export value to the soviet union was 
reported by usda at more than 298 billion for all commodities 
down from 329 billion in 198889 
without the credit line the soviet union was projected by usda 
to purchase about 2 billion worth of farm commodities this fiscal 
year down from more than 298 billion in the year that ended 
sept 30 and almost 33 billion in 198889 
at least part of the 1 billion credit will be used for 
commodities the soviets had already planned to buy in 199091 so 
it is conjecture at this point to say what the final purchase level 
may be 
exports are vital to american grain farmers particularly wheat 
producers whose crops are far in excess of domestic food needs 
a large harvest this year more than 274 billion bushels is 
adding to the us surplus and holding down market prices 
out of the 1990 harvest only 745 million bushels about 27 
percent of the total wheat output will be needed as food even 
with an increase in using wheat to feed livestock inventories will 
increase by the time another harvest is ready in 1991

everybody and his dog can now munch tropical 
treats being pitched to consumers as the new way to save shrinking 
rain forests 
sales of such products as ice cream mixed nuts and peanut 
brittle for pooches are beginning to channel money from 
environmentally conscious customers in the united states to the 
impoverished inhabitants of the distant forests 
so far the products are heavily dependent on nuts for snacks 
but promoters are hoping to expand to a broader range of consumer 
goods like soaps cosmetics and furniture polish 
the idea is to make sure that the worlds rain forests are worth 
more standing and producing sustainable harvests than cut for 
timber or cleared for pasture 
this by itself is not going to save the worlds rain 
forests said jason clay an anthropologist who has become an 
importer of forest nuts oils and fruits but this can become an 
important part of saving the rain forests and other fragile 
ecosystems 
clay is research director of cultural survival inc in 
cambridge mass a nonprofit group set up in 1972 to promote land 
rights and alternative development schemes for indigenous peoples 
in the third world 
the world resources institute estimated recently that 40 million 
to 50 million acres of tropical forests are vanishing each year a 
pace that could wipe them out by the end of the century 
environmentalists say this is likely to accelerate global warming 
because the forests soak up some of the worlds production of 
carbon dioxide 
scientists say the rain forests also are valuable as a home to 
an abundance of plant animal and insect species that live nowhere 
else some of which could prove useful in ways no one today can 
imagine many are likely to become extinct as their habitat 
shrinks 
in 1989 cultural survival got into the business of promoting 
trade in forest products as a way to get money into the hands of 
the people they were trying to help 
it is now selling imports mostly brazil nuts and cashews to 17 
companies currently marketing products in the united states 
including rainforest crunch and bowser brittle it also has 
provided samples to 75 companies for product development clay said 
in a telephone interview 
in hand we have about 41 million in orders for 1991 clay 
said we estimate that within five years were going to be doing 
more than 50 million worth of business 
besides creating new income for people living in the forest 
cultural survival is plowing its profits back into projects to 
strengthen native groups producer coops and other local 
organizations including rubber tappers 
so far most of its work has been in brazil bu it is expanding 
into bolivia and peru and has bought some dried fruit from honduras 
and belize honey and beeswax from zambia jams and jellies from 
the philippines and other products from ecuador colombia and 
botswana 
cultural survivals biggest customer is community products set 
up by ben cohen cofounder of ben and jerrys homemade ice cream 
it produces rainforest crunch both as candy for direct sale and as 
an ingredient in ben and jerrys rainforest crunch ice cream 
the concept is a really powerful one said martha broad 
comanager of community products which is based in montpelier vt 
customers like the taste but theyre also excited that were 
helping the people in the rain forest 
in 1990 300000 pounds of cashews and brazil nuts went into 
rainforest crunch ms broad said adding that a new product is 
coming chocolate chip brazil nut cookies 
then theres bowser brittle a concoction of rain forest 
cashews vanilla extract wheat germ flour eggs and peanuts with 
a label telling buyers they contribute to the saving of the rain 
forest 
the dogs seem to like it its one of our two top sellers 
said teri goodman a partner in dandy doggie a san franciscobased 
manufacturer of dog treats 
randy hayes head of the san franciscobased rainforest action 
network said environmental activists see marketing of forest 
products as a necessary part of a strategy to save the forests 
theres a common misconception that the tropical rain forest 
is unoccupied by humans hayes said 
in addition he said such products as rainforest crunch reach 
people unlikely to read ecology magazines or join environmental 
groups but who may take an interest in the worlds threatened 
forests 
theres been too much preaching to the choir he said the 
environmental movement has sadly become a special interest group 
this is an excellent way of reaching out to other segments of 
society

savings and loans associations could begin 
recovering by late next year if the nations economic slump is mild 
and brief but the industry would bleed red ink for years if the 
downturn is sharp and long economists say 
timothy ryan director of the governments office of thrift 
supervision blamed a neardoubling of losses at privately held 
sampls on slumping real estate markets in many areas of the country 
sampls lost 631 million in the julyseptember quarter compared 
with 302 million in the second quarter and 373 million in the 
first the thrift office said thursday 
as long as the real estate slump continues the thrift 
industry will have a tough time improving performance ryan said 
analyst donald crowley of keefe bruyette amp woods in new york 
said the industrys losses could begin to decline as early as late 
next year 
if projections for a short and shallow recession prove true 
we will probably see the worst of the thrift numbers sometime in 
1991 he said if the recession is deeper than that the losses 
will accelerate over the next couple years 
we will have at least two quarters of fairly disheartening 
numbers before we see anything better said martin regalia chief 
economist for the national council of savings institutions 
if we get into a steep recession then we have a whole 
different set of problems he said 
the thirdquarter deterioration among solvent institutions 
occurred even though the government has been closing down the worst 
institutions at the end of september there were 2389 privately 
run sampls 208 fewer than at the beginning of the year 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee said the report shows the cost of the savings and loan 
crisis estimated by the bush administration at 90 billion to 130 
billion is still increasing 
the recession has clearly snuffed out whatever light there was 
at the end of the sampl tunnel he said it is still going to be 
a long hard haul before the taxpayer emerges from this deep 
hole 
regalia called on regulators to more quickly eliminate insolvent 
sampls 
its quite clear that keeping defunct institutions in the 
market worsens the environment for solvent institutions he said 
the thrift office considers 218 of the 2389 privately run 
thrifts all but certain to fail and an additional 356 sampls with 
poor earnings as marginal 
ryan told congress earlier this week that his office would pick 
up the pace of thrift closures starting next month to seven or 
eight a week from two or three a week 
losses for the 206 institutions already seized by the government 
but still operating at the end of september were not released they 
likely will be made available next week by the resolution trust 
corp

ashton tate corp cannot claim copyrights to 
its popular dbase software because the company failed to disclose 
the program was based on one developed by nasas jet propulsion 
lab a judge ruled 
the jpl program is in the public domain and us district judge 
terry hatters ruling thursday could make one of the most widely 
used computer programs in the world available to anyone without 
charge 
were surprised and alarmed said ashton tate president 
william lyons 
he said the ruling is wrong and the company will ask hatter to 
reconsider ashton tate will appeal if hatter does not change it 
lyons said 
it appeared unlikely the federal judge would do so because his 
brief ruling was so strongly worded 
this was not an unclear document in regards to what the judge 
wanted to do although it may be a little unclear about why he did 
it said steve hess a specialist in personal computers with 
creative strategies research international a consulting and market 
research company in santa clara 
hess said if the ruling stands it likely will be the end of 
ashton tate which built its fortunes around dbase a product that 
sorts retrieves and indexes huge quantities of information 
the ruling may also open the door for additional challenges to 
copyrights issued to cmputer companies that did not entirely 
disclose to the us copyright office all similar predecessors to 
their products hess said 
this thing could have some very wide implications hess 
said 
hatters ruling stems from a copyright infringement lawsuit 
ashton tate filed in los angeles against competitors fox software 
inc and the santa cruz operation inc accusing them of selling 
software that mimics dbase hatter dismissed the suit 
former jpl employee wayne ratliff devised dbase and ashton tate 
essentially developed as a way to market it over a decade ashton 
tate copyrighted various updated versions of dbase including one 
bugridden version two years ago that nearly caused the downfall of 
the company 
in his written ruling hatter said that when ashton tate applied 
for a copyright it failed to mention the national aeronautics and 
space administrationjpl link 
ashton tate repeatedly failed to disclose material information 
to the united states copyright office hatters ruling said

newsstand operators sued the striking daily news 
drivers union saying it encouraged a campaign of violence to stop 
vendors from selling the paper 
two newsstand owners filed the classaction lawsuit thursday in 
us district court in manhattan on behalf of the citys 
approximately 12000 news vendors 
it seeks more than 30 million in damages from the newspaper amp 
mail deliverers union of new york and its president michael 
alvino the drivers union is one of nine that have been on strike 
against the paper since oct 25 
theodore kheel an adviser who often has spoken for the striking 
unions said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on 
it 
the complaint alleges that the drivers union has carried out a 
campaign of violence threats and intimidation that has created 
fear among the news dealers for their safety and the safety of 
their property 
the lawsuit seeks damages from the union for alleged violations 
of antitrust and labor laws and the racketeer influenced corrupt 
organizations act 
the daily news brought a similar racketeering lawsuit against 
the unions last month both suits detail allegations of attempted 
murder arson assault and vandalism and accuse the drivers 
union of a long history of racketeering 
plaintiffs in the vendors lawsuit are kishor mehta who 
operates 11 newsstands in coop city a large development in the 
bronx and nasir naveed who owns a stand in brooklyn

business inventories rose 04 percent in 
october the government reported today a moderate increase that 
analysts say is unlikely to accelerate already growing 
unemployment 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots totaled a seasonally adjusted 8139 billion up from 
8108 billion in september 
at the same time the department said business sales outpaced 
inventory growth rising 09 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
5518 billion sales had fallen 08 percent the previous month to 
5472 billion 
the activity pushed the ratio of inventoriestosales down to 
147 from 148 in september the ratio means it would take 147 
months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the october sales pace 
many economists do not consider a 147 ratio to be excessively 
high but a larger increase could be worrisome since a major rise 
in inventories in relation to sales could cause growing production 
cutbacks and job layoffs as businesses attempt to sell off the 
backlog 
even with the low inventory accumulation industrial production 
still fell 17 percent in november the federal reserve reported 
today at the same time 200000 factory jobs were lost that month 
according to labor department statistics 
the pace of accumulation has been and remains extremely 
conservative by historical standards economists at fuji 
securities inc in chicago wrote in their weekly newsletter 
perspectives it is far too slow to jeopardize the 
alreadyweakened economy with a purge of unwanted inventories 
although inventories grew in all three categories overall 
growth slowed from 07 percent in august and the revised 04 
percent increase in september was smaller than the 05 percent 
first reported 
manufacturing inventories edged up 01 percent while wholesalers 
posted a 02 percent gain on the retail level however the 
accumulation rose 10 percent 
at the same time manufacturers sales jumped 17 percent sales 
on the wholesale level rose 01 percent and on the retail level 
02 percent

northwest airlines has become the fourth carrier 
to join a freebie war that is spreading through the sagging air 
travel industry 
northwests promotion parallels offers by other airlines but 
is the only one to include free travel to europe and hawaii the 
carrier said in a statement thursday 
delta air lines fired the opening salvo early this week 
offering free flights or firstclass upgrades to anybody who 
completes eight segments of travel 
a segment generally means any separate flight or connecting 
flight that costs more than a minimum amount 
late thursday american airlines and united airlines announced 
their own programs offering free flights to be taken later next 
year for anybody who racks up either eight segments of flight or 
three round trips 
american acknowledged its offer was in response to delta and 
united acknowledged it was responding to the other two 
northwests program also requires three roundtrips or eight 
segments spokeswoman christy clapp said this morning 
airlines typically rush to match cheap fares and promotions 
offered by their competitors for fear they could otherwise lose 
passengers 
analysts have said the latest deal seems to be getting a head 
start on promotions that generally come out after the winter 
holiday season as the sluggish months of january and february set 
in 
they said the airlines need to avoid offering broad deals that 
are too good for passengers or run the risk of compounding troubles 
brought on by high fuel prices and sluggish demand for air travel

wholesale prices rose 05 percent in november 
the government said today a worrisome number but mild in 
comparison to the threemonth burst of inflation after iraqs 
invasion of kuwait sent energy costs spiraling 
its another terrible number we have not gotten rid of 
inflation said economist michael k evans a washington 
consultant 
faced with the disappointing news the stock market suffered a 
broad decline in early trading today most economists had 
anticipated a wholesale price rise of 01 percent to 03 percent 
the seasonallyadjusted november rise in the labor departments 
producer price index for finished goods which measures inflation 
one stop short of retail follows three months of steeper 
increases 
prices rose 11 percent in october and august and 16 percent in 
september the november increase although tame by comparison 
still translates into a 61 percent annual inflation rate 
in another economic report today the federal reserve said 
industrial production weakened in november for the third straight 
month falling back 17 percent to the lowest level since last 
january it was the steepest decline since output in manufacturing 
plunged 20 percent in december 1982 as the nation began crawling 
out of the last recession 
and the commerce department reported that business inventories 
rose 04 percent in october a moderate increase that analysts say 
is unlikely to accelerate already growing unemployment 
for the year so far wholesale prices have risen at a 69 
percent annual rate compared with 49 percent for all of 1989 
in november energy prices rose a scant 01 percent after 
soaring 8 percent in october 138 percent in september and 9 
percent in august 
gasoline prices fell 26 percent and fuel oil dropped 73 
percent however natural gas costs which had been largely 
unaffected by persian gulf turmoil rose 5 percent 
food prices rose 08 percent last month following a 09 percent 
jump in october 
the department said fresh and dried vegetable prices leapt 123 
percent and fish prices were up 81 percent costs also rose for 
fresh fruit rice beef pork and sweets prices fell for eggs 
dairy products chickens and turkeys pasta and shortening and 
cooking oils 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories 
considered a better barometer of underlying inflationary pressures 
by most economists rose 05 percent after no change in october 
tobacco prices were up 37 percent in november and 15 percent 
over the past year passenger cars rose 18 percent as some 
manufacturers curbed incentive programs costs also rose for 
medicines tires floor coverings and textile house furnishings 
prices fell steeply for glassware and edged down for lawn and 
garden equipment and sporting goods 
until todays inflation report most economists believed that 
federal reserve policymakers meeting monday would stimulate the 
economy with another cut in interest rates before the end of the 
year however the fed has nudged shortterm rates lowers three 
times since early november and may hesitate to cut them again if 
inflation worries persist 
reduced rates stimulate the economy by making it cheaper for 
consumers and businesses to borrow but they also tend to foster 
inflation by creating more demand for goods than producers can 
meet 
the various changes in november pushed the index for all 
finished goods to 1229 up from 1149 in november 1989 that means 
a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 cost 
12290 last month up from 11490 a year earlier 
price pressures earlier in the production process were more 
modest intermediate goods were up only 01 percent and the price 
of crude goods fell 62 percent 
an example of the three processing stages would be bread for 
finished flour for intermediate and wheat for crude 
most analysts believe the economic slump should keep wholesale 
price rises under control through 1991 if peace prevails in the 
persian gulf 
basically the surge has pretty well spent its force said 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago we 
may be surprised at how low the numbers are in the spring 
economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university is 
predicting that in 1991 the weak economy will hold price increases 
down to 22 percent the best since 1986 
dederick said the economic slump which most analysts believe is 
the beginning of a recession has dampened demand from consumers 
and businesses to the point where goods producers cant get price 
increases to stick 
i would think producer prices are headed lower how long they 
stay down depends on the depth of the recession and the vigor of 
the recovery he said

grain and soybean futures were higher in early

wheat futures may get some support from news the us 
agriculture department will allow producers to place up to 300 
million bushels of wheat in the farmerowned reserve 
moderate export sales in the latest week and a cutback in the

a us bankruptcy judge today turned down a 
federal agencys request for 45 more days to review the bankruptcy 
reorganization plan of southland corp the dallasbased owner of 
7eleven convenience stores 
judge harold abramson said the extension sought by the 
securities and exchange commission is too long for an opinion that 
is not required in the bankruptcy proceeding 
abramson had asked the sec for a statement about southlands 
prepackaged bankruptcy plan in which a creditorapproved 
blueprint for reemerging from bankruptcy reorganization is filed 
at the time a company seeks refuge from creditors ordinarily a 
company presents a reorganization plan months or even years later 
and creditors often challenge it 
the sec had wanted more time to prepare a statement saying 
southlands use of prepackaging would set a precedent for other 
large bankruptcy reorganizations and merited a lengthier review 
southland filed for bankruptcy protection in october using the 
prepackaging tool 
abramson said the sec has had months to look over southlands 
restructuring which he noted began in march 
i cant give you that long abramson told an sec attorney 
who asked for the 45day extension 
if the commission could make some kind of statement by dec 
31st or the first week of january that would be helpful to the 
court abramson said otherwise ill excuse you from that 
request 
the buck stops here anyway abramson said 
the judge indicated testimony in the southland confirmation 
hearing could last until early next month 
at the time of filing the company listed 253 billion in 
assets and 338 billion in liabilities and said it was overwhelmed 
by debt left from its 49 billion debtfinanced takeover in 1987 
southland which had sales of almost 8 billion last year is 
the largest of the few companies that have tried a prepackaged 
bankruptcy company officials believe prepackaging will allow the 
company to get out of the bankruptcy process in six months 
in addition to speeding up the bankruptcy process proponents of 
prepackaging say it assures a fairer deal for a greater number of 
creditors 
thats because a prepackaged plan must be approved by at least 
50 percent of the bondholders holding at least twothirds of a 
companys debt if a judge approves the terms of the plan are then 
imposed on the dissenting minority preventing holdouts from 
seeking better repayment terms 
southland in march said its japanese affiliates itoyokado co 
ltd and seveneleven japan co ltd were willing to spend 430 
million for stock in the reorganized company 
the terms of the prepackaged plan were agreed to in october 
just before the chapter 11 filing 
other companies notably atlantic city resorts owned by merv 
griffin and donald trump have used prepackaging in bankruptcy 
proceedings 
republic health corp a dallasbased owner of 14 hospitals 
filed a prepackaged chapter 11 plan last december and emerged from 
bankruptcy in april the company had posted a profit by the end of 
august

oil prices shot up today on speculation the 
united states and iraq would not be able to set up toplevel 
diplomatic meetings on the persian gulf crisis 
light sweet crude oil for january delivery was up 143 per 
barrel at 2785 early this afternoon on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
oil had opened higher in new york amid continued reports that 
us and iraqi officials were quarreling over a date for secretary 
of state james a baker iii to visit baghdad 
iraq has insisted that baker go to baghdad on jan 12 three 
days before the un security councils deadline for iraqi 
president saddam hussein to either withdraw his troops from 
oilrich kuwait or risk a military strike but the white house 
wants baker to visit iraq no later than jan 3 
the diplomatic logjam had pushed crude prices up 107 per 
barrel on thursday and the surge continued today 
the rally got an additional lift around midday when two senators 
announced bush was ready to call off the talks with the iraqis 
because of the disagreements the white house said bush had not 
given up hope for the talks but he planned a midafternoon 
statement on the situation that had the oil market on edge as crude 
traders wondered what bush would say 
the focus is on whether or not these talks are going to go 
ahead senior oil analyst annlouise hittle of shearson lehman 
brothers inc said this morning obviously the us and iraq are 
still at a stalement 
as crude moved ahead futures prices for refined petroleum 
products were also on the rise 
home heating oil was up 293 cents at 7750 cents per gallon for 
january delivery unleaded gasoline was up 248 cents at 6805 
cents per gallon for january delivery 
energy analyst thomas p blakeslee of pegasus econometric group 
inc in hoboken nj said heating oil had been the weaker of the 
futures contracts with supplies adequate and demand sluggish in 
the unseasonably warm fall 
it wont get cold blakeslee said its a little chilly 
out there today but theres no forecast for any types of freezing 
temperatures 
natural gas was up 2 cents at 224 per 1000 cubic feet for

ncr corps directors unanimously rejected 
american telephone amp telegraph cos 90ashare cash tender offer 
for the computer maker ncr said today 
in a statement ncr called the hostile takeover bid grossly 
inadequate and unfair 
clearly atampt is attempting for its own purposes to take 
advantage of ncrs artificially and temporarily depressed stock 
price ncr chairman charles e exley jr said in the statement 
we cannot and will not permit them to seize for themselves the 
enormous values that are building steadily within ncr exley 
said having just said no to this grossly inadequate offer we 
are focused on implementing the business strategy that will 
continue to build very real and very significant value for ncr 
shareholders customers and employees 
ncrs board met thursday in new york the company said it was 
the boards first meeting since atampt launched the 61 billion 
tender offer dec 5 
under securities and exchange commission rules ncr had 10 days 
until next wednesday to advise stockholders on the bid and to 
file an opinion with the sec 
ncr also said it filed amendments today to a lawsuit it had 
filed earlier in us district court in dayton ohio its 
headquarters city the suit seeks to have ncrs antitakeover plan 
declared valid 
the amendments allege that atampts government filings for its 
tender offer are false manipulative and misleading and that 
they violate federal securities law 
the amendments also allege the phone company filings 
failed to disclose that its tender offer is conditional upon 
ncrs board approving a friendly transaction with atampt 
failed to disclose facts about atampts own failures in the 
computer business 
falsely indicated atampt may be willing to wait 18 months to 
complete a business combination with ncr 
failed to disclose that combinations of computer companies in 
recent times have resulted in failure 
atampt spokesman walter murphy said the phone company had not 
fully studied the amended suit but we believe their claims are 
completely without merit our tender offer materials are complete 
and accurate 
earlier today atampt said it was disappointed by the ncr boards 
rejection of the tender offer 
our 90pershare price is a full fair offer as we believe 
ncr shareholders if given the opportunity to decide would 
agree the phone company said in a statement 
we are now examining our options for the next steps we will 
take atampt is determined to conclude the merger with ncr we still 
would much prefer to reach a negotiated agreement 
industry analysts say the most likely next step for atampt would 
be to launch a proxy battle to try to unseat ncrs directors ncr 
has in place a strong antitakeover plan that could be removed if 
atampt gains control of the board 
exley has said he would be willing to enter into negotiations 
with atampt if it raised its offer to 125 a share or a total of 
about 85 billion atampt rejected the higher price as outrageous 
and totally unjustified 
analysts said they believe exley is exploring several options to 
fight the takeover bid which he has called an attempt by atampt to 
rescue that companys unprofitable computer line 
i think exleys trying to find somebody who will bail him out 
of this predicatment without taking control of the company said 
john jones of montgomery securities inc in san francisco 
jones said exley may seek another company that would buy a major 
stake in ncr but allow the company to pursue its own course 
exley has said he has been in contact with other companies that 
might be interested in some sort of combination with ncr but he 
also said he is not interested in a white knight or another 
merger partner that would save ncr from the atampt bid 
the deal with atampt is either going to get done in two weeks 
or its going to be drawn out for months jones predicted atampts 
tender offer expires jan 4 
ncr stock was down 150 to 8862 a share by early afternoon 
today on the new york stock exchange atampt shares fell 50 cents to 
3050 
also thursday atampt filed a motion in us district court in 
dayton seeking to have a filing by ncr last week dismissed the 
filing asks the court to declare the companys antitakeover plan 
valid 
in addition the ohio senate judiciary committee scheduled a 
hearing for tuesday to review the takeover ncr spokesman mark 
feighery said exley plans to testify

chrysler corp said friday california billionaire 
kirk kerkorian had acquired more than 9 percent of its outstanding 
stock and the financially struggling automaker strengthened its 
poison pill antitakeover defense in response 
chrysler declined to comment on the move by kerkorian who has 
ties to the entertainment industry in southern california and is 
known for other takeover forays 
it wasnt immediately clear why kerkorian had invested in 
chrysler or how much he spent but the move came against a 
background of a mild resurgence in bigtime takeover maneuvering 
that were the hallmark of the 1980s 
in recent weeks for example hollywood entertainment giant mca 
inc has been acquired by the matsushita industrial conglomerate of 
japan for more than 66 billion and ncr corp has been fighting a 
61 billion takeover offer from american telephone and telegraph 
co 
investors who acquire more than 5 percent of a companys stock 
are required to disclose that information to the securities and 
exchange commission within 5 days after they go over the 5 percent 
threshhold but kerkorians disclosure statement wasnt immediately 
available at the sec headquarters in washington which closed early 
today at 2 pm 
chrysler is considered the weakest of the big three automakers 
and there has been persistent speculation that it might be 
purchased or merged with another company in the future 
trading in chrysler stock was halted on the new york stock 
exchange pending chryslers announcement at the time trading was 
halted chrysler stock was selling for 11875 a share down 37 
cents a share from thursdays close 
in response to kerkorians move chryslers board of directors 
on friday approved an amendment to its socalled poison pill 
share purchase rights plan that amendment lowers the threshold for 
the companys antitakeover mechanism to kick into action when 10 
percent of its stock has been purchased an investor previously the 
threshold was 20 percent 
if the mechanism goes into effect shareholders are able to buy 
stock at lessthanmarket value making it harder for a corporate 
raider for example to amass large quantities of stock 
the largest chrysler shareholders are the wellington group with 
about 92 percent and sanford c bernstein amp co inc with about 
83 percent which hold stock for some institutions such as 
pension funds

business sales outpaced inventory accumulation 
in october the government said friday giving some analysts hope 
that the economic downturn might be less severe than past slumps 
in previous recessions manufacturing activity fell off 
dramatically because of the buildup in inventories explained 
economist mark m zandi of regional financial associates in west 
chester pa businesses had to cut back their payrolls while 
they depleted their backlogs 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots in october expanded 04 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
8139 billion up from 8108 billion in september the revised 
04 percent increase in september was smaller than the 05 percent 
first reported 
at the same time the department said business sales rose 09 
percent to a seasonally adjusted 5518 billion sales had fallen a 
revised 05 percent the previous month to 5472 billion september 
sales first were reported to have been off 08 percent 
the october activity resulted in an inventorytosales ratio of 
147 down from 148 the previous month the ratio means it would 
take 147 months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the october 
sales pace the ratio reached 174 in january 1982 during the last 
recession 
the fact that inventories remained lean suggests that although 
were in a slowdown theres not a lot of inventory correction 
needed and that will keep the slowdown mild and of shorter 
duration zandi said 
evelina tainer an economist with first national bank of 
chicago said the ratio suggests unemployment will go up but not 
as much as in past recessions 
nevertheless inventories on the retail level rose a hefty 10 
percent while gaining just 01 percent on the manufacturing level 
and 02 percent on the wholesale level 
while saying inventories overall have been kept under pretty 
good control economist robert brusca of nikko securities co 
international in new york said he still was concerned over the 
retail level particularly if this is a disappointing christmas 
shopping season 
the commerce department said thursday that retail sales in 
november fell 01 percent since the thanksgiving weekend 
traditionally is the start of holiday shopping many analysts said 
the report pointed to weak sales 
manufacturers sales jumped 17 percent in october while sales 
rose 01 percent on the wholesale level and 02 percent on the 
retail level

us coal production and consumption 
should top more than 1 billion tons for the first time in 1990 
marking the fourth consecutive record year industry officials said 
friday 
what we have seen is consistent steady growth from year to 
year said john grasser spokesman for the national coal 
association in washington its not what youd call robust and 
dramatic but its steady growth 
the industry groups forecast predicts 1990 production will 
reach 102 billion tons 41 million tons more than the record 981 
million tons produced in 1989 grasser said 
the 42 percent increase in bituminous subbituminous lignite 
and anthracite production is the largest yeartoyear increase 
since 1983 and 1984 he said 
this is just that natural steady progression from year to 
year grasser said eighty percent of the coal goes to the 
utility sector thats obviously our largest customer and thats 
where weve seen the largest growth 
he said demand was helped by an increase in exports to foreign 
customers and an unusually high demand for utility stockpiles 
west virginia the nations third largest producer was running 
nearly 14 percent ahead of last years production figures through 
october with 1442 million tons mined said kathy sloan of the 
state division of energy 
wyoming has ranked no 1 in coal production since 1988 kentucky 
passed west virginia as the leading producer in 1972 
from what industry officials tell me we have a pretty decent 
shot at coming even with kentucky and maybe even passing it said 
mark polen vice president of the west virginia coal association 
its going to be pretty close 
while 1990 will be remembered as a banner year for the coal 
industry grasser said the outlook for 1991 isnt quite as 
positive 
we are predicting a flat or even slight decline next year due 
in part to the recession and the slowing of the economy grasser 
said 
national coal association forecasts for 1991 predict that 
production will decline by 147 percent while consumption will 
increase by 1 percent 
however richard lawson president of the national coal 
association said the persian gulf crisis may help the industry 
next year 
the recent and volatile increase in oil prices could have a 
positive effect on coal burn next year especially if the middle 
east situation is not resolved quickly lawson said 
recently enacted clean air legislation also could begin having 
some effects on the coal industry officials said 
its dicey to predict how that act is going to work because 
were not sure how the utility companies will respond to it 
polen said

grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly 
higher friday in lackluster trading on the chicago board of trade 
the market was in a bearish position as a result of the 
smallerthanexpected us export credits given the soviet union 
earlier this week analysts said 
traders were wary of taking positions pending an announcement 
of a breakdown of the commodities the soviet union will buy with 
the 500 million to 1 billion in export credits said analyst joel 
karlin of research department inc 
corn futures came under pressure with news that south korea made 
a major purchase of chinese corn 
wheat futures were boosted by a decision of the us agriculture 
department to allow producers to place up to 300 million bushels of 
wheat in the farmerowned reserve the decision was made because of 
concern over falling prices and lagging exports 
at the close wheat was 1 cents lower cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 253 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 1 higher with december at 223 a bushel oats were 
cent to 1 cent higher with december at 108 a bushel soybeans

tribune co said friday its operating profit 
will slide substantially more than 25 percent this year because of 
the weak advertising climate and rising costs of a strike at its 
new york daily news 
company executives failed to specify how much the sevenweekold 
strike by nine of the 10 labor unions at the newspaper is costing 
the paper has continued to publish despite the strike although 
circulation is down sharply 
the executives repeated earlier assertions that they intended to 
continue publishing the paper as long as it continues to progress 
in a separate appearance before securities analysts at the 
annual painewebber media outlook conference knightridder inc 
said it expected earnings would be up modestly in 1990 compared 
with results in 1989 that excluded a gain on the sale of a 
newspaper 
chairman james batten said the miamibased newspaper and 
information services company has a realistic chance for at least 
a flat year in earnings per share next year 
the companies made their appearances on the closing day of the 
weeklong conference that has featured mostly glum earnings 
forecasts due to advertising demand that has weakened along with 
the economy 
a top advertising forecaster robert coen has estimated ad 
spending will rise only 49 percent this year its slowest pace of 
growth since 1975 and grow 46 percent in 1991 
tribune which publishes the chicago tribune and five other 
newspapers in addition to the news and owns six television 
stations earned 317 a share for all of 1989 operating earnings 
amounted to 433 million last year 
but the tough advertising climate helped push operating earnings 
for the first nine months of this year down 25 percent from a year 
ago as a doubledigit decline in the newspaper group more than 
offset gains in broadcasting and entertainment operations 
fourthquarter earnings while not out yet also are below 
levels of last year the news employees went on strike on oct 25 
and newsprint operations were depressed by a strike at canadian 
mill that has just been resolved 
scott smith chief financial officer of the tribune said 
operating results are down by about 20 percent in the last three 
months of the year excluding the effect of the strikes and 
substantially more if they are included 
he said the decline in operating profit for the full year will 
be substantially larger than 25 percent including strike costs 
smith told analysts that earnings per share excluding losses at 
the daily news and the newsprint mill should amount to about 3 
compared with 317 a year ago and said earnings will be below 3 
a share next year 
he said the company would disclose the magnitude of the losses 
at the daily news when it reports its 1990 earnings early next 
year 
daily news publisher james hoge said the newspaper continues to 
hope a reasonable settlement can be reached to end the strike but 
that the paper will continue to publish as long as it was making 
progress toward regaining circulation and advertising 
he said daily circulation has reached about 600000 after 
sinking as low as 250000 shortly after the strike began it was 
more than 109 million before the strike 
hoge has previously said the daily news lost 115 million 
betwen 1979 and 1989 and that losses by the end of 1990 will rise 
to about 200 million 
financial analysts who were the only attendees allowed to ask 
questions at the session did not ask about the size of the news 
losses 
knightridder which owns 29 daily newspapers including the 
miami herald and the phildelphia inquirer said it anticipates 
earning 290 to 297 a share in 1990 compared with 286 a share 
excluding a gain on the sale of a newspaper in 1989 
the advertising climate has weakend along with the economy in 
the fourth quarter but knightridder aides said earnings per share 
should at least match the 1990 figure in 1991 
revenue is expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent next year 
with slightly higher revenue from newspapers and a doubledigit 
increase from business information services said robert singleton 
senior vice president for finance

union workers overwhelming approved a 
new contract friday with delta pride catfish inc ending a bitter 
threemonth strike that brought out allegations of racial 
discrimination 
the plight of the workers in one of the nations most 
economically depressed regions attracted support from the naacp and 
other civil rights organizations and led to a national boycott of 
delta pride products 
the contract vote was 4791 union officials said the lone vote 
against appeared to be a misunderstanding over wage provisions in 
the pact 
this is a great christmas present said sarah white a shop 
steward who has been with delta pride since 1983 one year after 
the nations largest catfish processor opened i feel good about 
this contract and ive talked with several coworkers and they are 
satisfied 
we finally got some of the things we wanted including 
things that should make the workplace better for all of us 
the strike began sept 13 when members of united food and 
commercial workers union local 1529 rejected a contract about 900 
workers walked off the job at delta prides indianola and inverness 
plants a third plant in belzoni employs nonunion workers 
the company had no immediate comment on the contract vote 
provisions in the contract include wage increases and assurances 
that striking workers will be rehired union officials said 
the contract grants immediate raises of 60 to 65 cents an hour 
for all workers with at least one year of seniority pay averaged 
405 an hour before the strike the pact also establishes a 
workermanagement health and safety committee to monitor conditions 
at the plant 
while there were scattered reports of violence including 
rockthrowing early in the strike officials said recent weeks 
were quiet 
aaron henry president of the mississippi naacp said the 
workers anger arose from a combination of race and economics 
coupled with the philosophy of the plantation 
besides wages the union also raised concerns about working 
conditions a common complaint among workers has been about 
repetitive motion injury 
workers complained that they were timed with a stopwatch when 
skinning gutting slicing and packaging fish the also complained 
of limited restroom breaks six fiveminute bathroom breaks per 
week violators risked dismissal 
white who has two children said the three months she has been 
on strike created financial problems but the union helped take 
care of our bills and provided groceries for us we really 
sacrificed but we had help with the basics 
white 32 of moorhead said she planned to be in st louis this 
weekend to attend a support rally for the striking workers 
now i can tell them it is over and tell them to start buying 
catfish we need the hours at work she said 
e dale cline of memphis tenn the federal mediator who helped 
work out the new contract said he is tickled to death that this 
is finally over 
union spokesman neel lattimore said the contract goes a long way 
toward improving working conditions 
we feel like there is language in the contract to make delta 
pride more sensitive to working conditions and by all of us 
working together we can get along he said

the stock market recorded a broad loss today 
weighed down by disappointing inflation news 
the day got off to a rocky start when the labor department 
reported that the producer price index rose 05 percent in 
november 
that came as an unpleasant surprise to traders who had been 
expecting a considerably smaller increase given a recent letup in 
the rise of oil prices 
separate government reports showed a 17 percent drop in 
industrial production last month and a slowing in the operating 
rate of the nations factories mines and utilities to 809 percent 
of capacity from 824 percent in october 
analysts said that mixture of news provided stockmarket 
investors with little encouragement about the outlook for the 
economy and corporate profits

oil prices rallied friday as traders speculated 
president bush might scrap diplomatic meetings with iraq then 
crude fell back sharply when bushs news conference rhetoric was 
not so harsh 
light sweet crude oil settled at 2655 per barrel up 13 cents 
at the new york mercantile exchange on contracts for delivery in 
january crude for delivery in most later months closed lower 
in early trading crude had jumped up by 168 per barrel amid 
continued quarreling between the united states and iraq over a date 
for secretary of state james a baker iii to visit baghdad two 
senators said in washington that bush might be ready to abandon the 
idea of the talks adding to oils rally 
after bush said in the afternoon that he was discouraged but 
still hoped the talks could be held crude plunged more than 1 per 
barrel in about a half hour 
it was probably a little overbought on the whole situation 
said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc once he came out and didnt do anything it was 
easy to sell off probably a little bit of buytherumor 
sellthefact 
oil traders often run up prices by buying crude futures 
contracts when rumors hit the market because they dont want to 
run the risk of getting left out of a rally they are more likely 
to sell off their oil contracts on the basis of facts that indicate 
adequate supplies or sluggish demand 
during the week crude hit its lowest prices since aug 3 the 
day after iraq invaded kuwait but after the close of 2535 per 
barrel on wednesday it began moving higher 
oil had been steadily dropping since nov 30 when bush first 
proposed the talks with iraq and traders began believing a peaceful 
solution to the crisis could be at hand 
once the diplomats showed they could not even agree on dates to 
meet the war fears began resurfacing 
the last few days it seemed like the peace talk has 
diminished said ed kevelson a trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc 
for the week crude finished 3 cents higher on january delivery 
contracts 
refined petroleum products moved in tandem with crude on friday 
rising in early trading then dropping to show little change at the 
close 
home heating oil was up 67 cent at 7524 cents a gallon for 
january delivery unleaded gasoline was up 61 cent at 6618 cents 
a gallon for january delivery 
heating oil has shown the most weakness of late with supplies 
adequate and demand sluggish amid unseasonably warm fall weather 
it wont get cold said thomas p blakeslee an energy 
analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
its a little chilly out there today but theres no forecast for 
any types of freezing temperatures 
for the week heating oil fell 393 cents for nextmonth 
delivery while gasoline fell 29 cent 
natural gas for january delivery closed friday at 2262 per 
1000 cubic feet up 42 cents for the day but down 88 cents for 
the week

for weeks the nations farmers and grain and soybean traders had 
been waiting with anticipation the bush administrations decision 
on extending export credits to the soviet union 
that decision came wednesday and it was disappointing 
the united states will grant 500 million to 1 billion in 
export credits to the soviet union to buy much needed grain and 
other food products 
traders were expecting a credit package of 15 billion remarks 
by sen robert dole rkan led the markets to believe the 
administration could grant the soviets 3 billion in credits 
farmers and traders were pressing for the granting of export 
credits to the soviets because us exports have been lagging 
tremendously 
this year corn exports are 36 percent behind levels last year 
wheat shipments are down 23 percent and soybean exports are at 
their lowest levels in 16 years 
our exports are so far behind if we dont start giving stuff 
away we are going to end up with excess inventory said william 
biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
but analysts said credits of less than 1 billion wont allow 
the soviet union improve this countrys grain exports they wont 
allow the soviets to fulfill their longterm grainbuying agreement 
with the united states the soviets are committed to buy 12 
million metric tons of wheat and 600000 metric tons of corn by 
yearend 
the apparent lack of generosity by the united states has riled 
some traders 
analyst daniel basse of agresource co in chicago said the 
amount of the credits are equivalent to a miniembargo he says 
that since other nations are offering the soviets as much as 12 
billion in food aid theres some pretty intense competition for 
their business 
other grainexporting nations have freely given export credits 
to the soviets which put pressure on the us to extend export 
credits bumper crops have given the soviets access to soybean meal 
and corn from south america and wheat for europe and canada 
disappointment with the smallerthanexpected offering of export 
credits extended to the livestock and pork market 
a larger credit line had been expected to lead to meat purchases 
by the soviets but they are now likely to confine purchases to 
grains 
beidermann said farmers particularly those who do not 
participate in government programs have been hard hit by the 
declining exports he said there is no reason for the united states 
to be reluctant to sell its grain to the soviets because the nation 
has so much 
in granting the credits president bush lifted a 15year ban 
imposed because of the soviet prohibition of free emigration the 
jacksonvanik amendment barred closer ussoviet economic ties 
until soviet jews and others were free to emigrate in large 
numbers 
this year 150000 soviet jews have moved to israel and 50000 
to the united states kremlin officials said this past week that a 
further liberalization in immigration laws was planned 
biedermann said a big question remains whether the amount of 
export credits granted wednesday is part of bigger pie 
the next prominent opportunity for the united states to announce 
export credits to the soviets will come in february when president 
bush will travel to moscow to meet with soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev

a few days before her senaterace loss rep 
lynn martin stood in a chicago alley and argued with a man who said 
he was disgusted with her tv ads 
cars honked but martin didnt budge the native chicagoan was 
near her old neighborhood and like most politicians in that brawny 
town she wasnt ready to yield an inch 
not mine she told the man who said her senate campaign ads 
were nasty usually before you hang somebody you have some 
evidence 
her accuser was not convinced voters were not sold on her 
either sen paul simon dill crushed the republican challenger 
in a 980000vote landslide that even swept martins home county 
winnebago 
soon to be out of work for the first time in her 18year 
political career martin accepted an invitation friday to join 
president bushs cabinet as labor department secretary replacing 
elizabeth dole 
simon immediately jumped on her bandwagon 
i will vote for her and i wish her the very best he said 
the senate must confirm the appointment 
despite representing rockford a bluecollar city that is 
illinois secondlargest martin never forged any ties to organized 
labor during her 10 years in the house 
business groups gave her 358439 in campaign contributions from 
1983 through 1988 labor groups donated only 3900 
i of course am probusiness martin said earlier this 
year i think probusiness is proworker 
it isnt a belief that business should always be protected in 
things like the environment who should be hired there are a lot 
of things that business has to do a lot better with she said 
in one of the most significant businesslabor debates of 1988 
congress passed a bill requiring a 60day notice of large layoffs 
or plant closings martin voted no 
the smaller companies who would be forced to give that 60day 
notice would find themselves losing virtually all credit and any 
chance to survive she said 
judith lynn morley martin was born in chicago on dec 26 1939 
a graduate of the university of illinois she taught high school 
economics government and english before beginning her public 
career with a race for winnebago county board in 1972 
four years later she was elected to the illinois house and in 
1978 the illinois senate when john b anderson ran for president 
in 1980 voters promoted martin to the us house where she was 
reelected four times 
declaring that simon was too liberal for illinois martin ran 
for senate this year but she was never able to overcome his 
statewide popularity match his 8 million campaign chest or 
develop a clear campaign theme 
perhaps her favorite achievement in congress she said was a 
house rule that established an antidiscrimination program the 
office of fair employment practices mediates disputes between 
lawmakers and their staff members 
it was a giant step forward martin said in august you 
now see women who are administrative assistants minorities 
have a chance to complain if they feel there is racial prejudice 
few laws however carry her name

wall street analysts have some words of caution 
for all investors consumers and business planners who have put 
lower interest rates on their holidayseason wish lists this 
year 
true interest rates have come down significantly since they hit 
their 1990 peaks around the beginning of autumn 
true also the federal reserve seems committed to a policy of 
gradually but steadily loosening its credit policy helping to 
foster lower rates as it seeks to cushion the impact of a 
developing recession 
and true too the consensus prediction among financial analysts 
is for further declines in interest rates at least through the 
early stages of 1991 
but at least a few scroogian voices can be heard in the chorus 
of yearend forecasts being issued these days in the investment 
world 
quite a few potential pitfalls dot the road to lower rates this 
winter the skeptics say furthermore they add even if rates are 
indeed headed for further declines the circumstances that permit 
that to happen may be pretty unpleasant 
one widely cited prerequisite for lower rates is a steady 
improvement in the news on inflation wall street suffered a 
disappointment on that score friday when the labor department 
reported that the producer price index rose 05 percent in 
november 
traders had been expecting a considerably smaller increase 
given a recent letup in the rise of oil prices 
the inflation outlook could be scrambled further should the 
showdown in the persian gulf take an unexpected turn sending oil 
higher once again 
the gulf crisis and oil prices are the obvious wild cards 
observed edward taber at the investment management firm of t rowe 
price associates in his forecast for 1991 the less obvious 
factor which could alter our forecast is a much stronger economy 
than is currently in the consensus 
that could occur taber contends as a result of such forces as 
the feds easing heavy deficit spending by the government tight 
inventories at many businesses and any revival of consumer 
spending 
should this alternative become reality we would expect rates 
to move markedly higher throughout the year he said 
the stock market struggled with such doubts through the past 
week changing directions at least half a dozen times the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 259381 up 371 
from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 36 to 
17871 the american stock exchange market value index fell 71 to 
30574 and the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter 
market was down 271 at 36883 
volume on the big board averaged 15585 million shares a day 
against 200 million in the previous week 
wary analysts recall that interestrate hopes also ran high last 
year about this time the dow jones industrial average reached a 
thenrecord closing peak of 281015 last jan 2 
but it tumbled 26691 points or 95 percent over the next four 
weeks as rates unexpectedly turned higher following the lead of 
interest rates in japan and germany 
if rates keep declining now some observers say they could be 
signaling a deeperthanexpected recession chilling any joy over 
cheaper money 
with all this though many optimists remain on wall street 
offering assurances that the economy and the markets can ride out 
the storm 
will lower interest rates revive economic growth they always 
have in the past said edward yardeni chief economist at 
prudentialbache securities 
interest rates should hit their lows around march if the 
economy starts to show some signs of life during the first quarter 
as we expect 
if however the economy continues to fall during the first 
quarter then interest rates will fall as low as necessary to 
revive economic growth

disappointing inflation news and a rise in 
interest rates helped drive the stock market into a broad retreat 
friday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 2055 to 
259381 closing out the week with a net gain of 371 points

trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 18258 million shares 
the day got off to a rocky start when the labor department 
reported that the producer price index rose 05 percent in 
november 
that came as an unpleasant surprise to traders who had been 
expecting a considerably smaller increase given a recent letup in 
the rise of oil prices 
in the bond market which is especially sensitive to shifting 
inflationary expectations interest rates rose for the second 
straight session prices of longterm government bonds fell more 
than 5 for each 1000 in face value putting their yields in the 
neighborhood of 819 percent 
separate government reports showed a 17 percent drop in 
industrial production last month and a slowing in the operating 
rate of the nations factories mines and utilities to 809 percent 
of capacity from 824 percent in october 
analysts said that mixture of news provided stockmarket 
investors with little encouragement about the outlook for the 
economy and corporate profits

and ford motor was down at 25 the stocks of both auto giants 
traded this week at their lowest levels in more than two years

southland corps bankruptcy plan confirmation 
hearing began friday with attorneys clashing over efforts by the 
parent of the 7eleven convenience store chain to disclose 
reorganization options 
southland filed for chapter 11 reorganization in october with a 
prepackaged plan already approved by most of its creditors 
us bankruptcy judge harold abramson must confirm the plan for it 
to take effect 
abramson said he would first hear arguments over southlands 
attempts to inform creditors of the dallasbased companys 
financial condition and options then hear arguments on the merits 
of the reorganization plan the hearing is expected to last for 
several weeks 
at the time of the bankruptcy filing southland listed 253 
billion in assets and 338 billion in liabilities and said it was 
overwhelmed by debt left from its 49 billion debtfinanced 
takeover in 1987 
during opening statements attorneys for creditors who oppose 
the plan argued that southland did not give them enough time for 
its consideration used a complicated ballot and withheld 
information about the compensation of the companys founding 
family 
southlands attorney mike sutherland of dallas said the 
company followed existing regulations for a prepackaged filing he 
said the dissenting creditors want abramson to give them more 
leverage than they have 
southland is the largest of a handful of companies to try a 
prepackaged filing first used about a year ago the companys case 
has drawn extraordinary attention in the legal community because of 
its precedentsetting use of the prepackaging 
proponents of the prepackaging device say it reduces the time a 
company stays in bankruptcy and assures a fairer deal for a greater 
number of creditors 
ordinarily a company presents a reorganization plan months or 
even years later after filing for bankruptcy and creditors often 
challenge it often a small number of creditors called holdouts 
will vote against any reorganization in hopes of a separate deal 
that is better leaving the majority to accept repayment on terms 
that arent as good 
when a judge approves a prepackaged filing its terms are 
imposed on all creditors 
peter wolfson attorney for some of the dissenting creditors 
said the company doesnt have the support for the plan that it has 
portrayed but he acknowledged that in most aspects the companys 
plan is supported by a majority of the people that southland owes 
money 
under the plan creditors end up with control of 25 percent of 
the company southlands japanese affiliates itoyokado co ltd 
and seveneleven japan co ltd get 70 percent and the rest is 
left to the the companys founders the thompson family of dallas 
jere and john thompson sons of southland founder joe thompson 
lose their posts as the companys chief officers they remain 
directors and continue to be paid 600000 annually under the 
plan their brother joe thompson jr would also remain a director 
of southland 
abramson began the hearing by refusing to give another 45 days 
for the securities and exchange commission to review the southland 
plan 
sec attorney john lee said agency officials wanted the extension 
because southlands plan would set a precedent for other 
prepackaged bankruptcy cases 
abramson said the extension was too long for an opinion that is 
not required by the bankruptcy code the judge asked the sec to 
present a statement of position to help him form a ruling 
if the commission could make some kind of statement by dec 
31st or the first week of january that would be helpful to the 
court abramson said otherwise ill excuse you from that 
request 
the buck stops here anyway abramson said

california billionaire kirk kerkorian has bought 
98 percent of the stock of chrysler corp for about 272 million 
making him the companys largest shareholder and prompting the 
struggling automaker to beef up its takeover defenses 
a statement issued through a los angeles public relations agency 
said the purchase was made as an investment chrysler spokesman 
arthur liebler confirmed that a discussion took place last wek 
between kerkorian of beverly hills calif and chrysler chairman 
lee iacocca 
thats when kerkorian said that hes supportive of chrysler 
and he described himself as a passive investor liebler said 
friday 
nevertheless chryslers board of directors on friday lowered 
from 20 percent to 10 percent the amount of stock an investor may 
hold before the companys antitakeover mechanisms take effect 
those mechanisms include offering current chrysler stockholders 
shares at lessthanmarket value that makes a hostile takeover 
more difficult and expensive 
through a spokesman kerkorian indicated he was surprised by the 
boards action 
it is hard for us to see how the steps taken by the board 
today are in the best interest of all the shareholders the 
statement said 
it did not say when kerkorian bought the stock or what range he 
paid for the shares 
a woman answering the telephone at kerkorians tracinda corp in 
beverly hills who did not identify herself said no corporate 
officers were available and all comment was coming from the agency 
more light may be shed in papers that must be filed with the 
securities and exchange commission when an investor acquires 5 
percent of a companys stock kerkorian had not filed the papers by 
the time the offices closed at 2 pm est 
chrysler first announced the purchase saying kerkorian had 
acquired between 9 percent and 10 percent of the companys 224 
million shares of outstanding common stock 
about an hour earlier trading in chrysler stock was halted on 
the new york stock exchange with shares at 1187 trading 
resumed about two hours later and chrysler stock rose to 12 a 
share down 25 cents from thursdays close chrysler shares 
regained the 25 cents and closed for the day at 1225 
the purchase makes kerkorian chryslers largest shareholder the 
wellington group has about 92 percent and sanford c bernstein amp 
co inc about 83 percent both hold stock for institutions such 
as pension funds 
according to chryslers latest proxy statement iacocca owned 
about 192000 shares of stock or less than a tenth of 1 percent 
kerkorian 73 is known as a highrolling airline and las vegas 
casino investor on nov 1 he completed the sale of mgmua 
communications co for 13 billion to pathe communications corp 
owned by italian financier giancarlo parretti 
there has been speculation for months that chrysler which is 
struggling to be profitable this year could be subject to a 
takeover or may offer some of its equity to another automaker 
last month about the same time kerkorian sold mgmua chrysler 
broke off talks with the huge italian automaker fiat spa those 
talks had included discussions about business and commercial 
arrangements 
analysts speculated kerkorians move was purely for investment 
he figures he has himself as close to a nolose proposition in 
the stock market said auto analyst charles brady of 
oppenheimer amp co in new york the stock has bottomed out and 
everybody has said everything bad about it chrysler as they can 
i think its a genius move barring nuclear war in the middle 
east he gets his money back 
kerkorian personally owned about 70 percent of the mgmua stock 
and controlled another 10 percent through a foundation the sale 
last month to pathe netted him an estimated 1 billion 
until he files the sec forms nobody really knows what his 
true intentions are said auto analyst mary anne sudol of fitch 
investors service inc it could be the vague old for investment 
purposes only or it could be something else 
chrysler like the other domestic automakers has been hurt this 
year by sagging sales in a flagging economy it took a 214 million 
loss in the third quarter on 65 billion in revenue compared to 
331 million in earnings on 76 billion in revenue in the 1989 
period 
chrysler is the smallest of the big three with 23 billion in 
revenue through september compared to 95 billion for general 
motors corp and 735 billion for ford motor co

wholesale prices rose 05 percent in november 
the government said friday analysts called it a disturbingly high 
increase at a time when the economy is slumping and energy costs 
are moderating 
in a separate report the federal reserve said us 
manufacturing had suffered its steepest onemonth plunge in eight 
years 
the seasonally adjusted november rise in the labor departments 
producer price index for finished goods which measures prices one 
stop short of retail looked tame in comparison with monthly 
increases topping 1 percent from august through october 
novembers increase translates however into a worrisome 61 
percent annual rate 
its another terrible number we have not gotten rid of 
inflation said economist michael k evans a washington 
consultant 
faced with the disappointing news after forecasts of a price 
rise of only 01 percent to 03 percent the stock and bond markets 
retreated the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 
2055 to 259381 closing out the week with a net gain of 371 
points interest rates rose in the bond market with longterm 
government bonds falling 5 for each 10wd searching handbags and clothing 
for weapons but there were no incidents to the chants of 
hallelujah people carried placards reading aristide will 
save haiti and sang its you were looking for now we are 
saved 
aristide carrying poinsettas was mobbed by a throng of 
screaming fans before he briefly addressed the crowd 
we are the flowers of brotherhood he said we are 
carrying the flowers to victory 
haiti has been ruled by dictators virtually since it won 
independence from france in 1804 and established the worlds first 
black republic two elections held the past four years have been 
rigged or halted because of violence 
but many haitians said friday they believed foreign observers 
would make a difference this time 
even if 100 people get killed the election will go on said 
jeanclaude bajeux a civil rights activist who spent many years in 
exile during the duvalier family dictatorship 
about 3 million people are registered to vote for president 
bicameral legislature mayors and county officials the government 
has set up 14500 polling places and they will be open from 6 am 
to 6 pm sunday 
the elections gained new vigor a month ago when aristide 
declared his candidacy he is the favorite of the poor who make up 
most of this caribbean nations 6 million residents 
an advocate of liberation theology or church involvement in the 
struggles of the poor aristide was expelled from the salesian 
order in 1988 for allegedly fomenting revolution 
he remains a priest however and has said he would renounce the 
priesthood to comply with vatican rules against holding public 
office if he wins the election 
marc bazin a former world bank economist and finance minister 
fired by the dictatorial duvalier regime for investigating 
corruption is believed to be the favorite of the middle class he 
has a considerable following in the countryside 
bazin campaigned friday in the mountain town of tomassin 
overlooking the wealthy suburb of petionville 
people like me a working man will vote for aristide because 
he stands for change said a street vendor who would only give 
his first name antoine the bourgeoise will vote for bazin 
election observers from the united nations organization of 
american states and the caribbean economic community will monitor 
the vote 
former president jimmy carter who has monitored elections in 
panama and nicaragua arrived friday afternoon with a team of 34 
observers from the council of freely elected heads of government 
president bush sent former gov william janklow of south dakota 
as head of an eightmember us government delegation 
the election in haiti offers a historic opportunity for the 
haitian people to freely choose their leaders after decades of 
dictatorship said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
at the request of the interim government of president 
erthapascal trouillot the united nations sent 64 unarmed military 
advisers to work with haitis notoriously illdisciplined army to 
prevent election violence 
until 1986 the duvalier family enforced its rule for 29 years 
with the help of a brutal private militia known as the tonton 
macoutes 
the dictatorship ended in 1986 after jeanclaude duvalier fled 
to exile in france 
many holdovers from the duvalier regime have remained intent on 
keeping their hold on power and have sabotaged elections twice 
since jeanclaude was deposed 
the elections in 1987 were aborted after armybacked thugs 
massacred 34 voters at the polls the army dissolved the 
independent electoral council and held rigged elections in 1988 
there has been relatively little violence during this years 
campaign 
fears of a bloody election were heightened on dec 5 when 
unidentified assailants threw a grenade and opened fire on people 
leaving an aristide rally killing seven and wounding more than 50 
others 
aristide blamed the attack on roger lafontant selfproclaimed 
chief of the tonton macoutes and avid duvalier supporter and 
demanded his arrest lafontant denied his involvement 
lafontant returned from exile to run for president but was 
disqualified on technicalities by the electoral council 
he said this week he was the head of the tonton macoutes and the 
duvalierist movement and that he was determined to keep aristide 
from becoming president

motorola inc will produce its next 
generation of computer memory chips in japan under a joint venture 
with japanese electronics manufacturer toshiba a spokesman said 
friday 
the fourmegabit dynamic random access memory chips will be 
manufactured at a factory in sendai japan that is coowned by 
motorola and toshiba rather than at motorolas new chip plant in 
austin texas said motorola spokesman dan rogers 
when production of the dynamic ram or dram chips begins in 
the third quarter of 1991 it will mark the first time motorola 
will offer that particular chip in large quantities rogers said 
the demand for faster computers has spurred a growing demand for 
another type of semiconductor static random access memory chips 
which are even faster than the dynamic ram chips to be produced in 
japan 
motorola based in this northwest chicago suburb decided to 
build the dynamic ram chips in japan and use its mos11 factory in 
austin to produce static ram chips beginning in 1992 the company 
said in a news release 
rapidly increasing demand worldwide for our fast static 
rams and microprocessors is straining our existing production 
capacity so mos11 will be used to meet this need said jim 
george vice president of motorolas mos memory products division 
in austin 
static ram chips are more expensive to produce but are four 
times faster than a dynamic ram chip of equal memory that speed 
makes the static ram chips desirable for computers used in the 
workplace an industry analyst said 
there is a definite demand for static rams which are 
potentially more profitable than dynamic rams the demand for that 
highspeed static ram is growing by leaps and bounds said 
millard phelps an analyst at the san francisco investment firm 
hambrecht amp quist 
motorola entered a longterm agreement with toshiba in 1986 to 
produce dynamic ram chips 
we are not going to be a leader in the dram industry the 
japanese have taken over that market rogers said thats why 
weve gone into a partnership agreement rather than going out on 
our own its a very expensive business to be in 
toshiba officials dismissed as speculation published reports 
that they pressured motorola into producing the dynamic ram chip in 
japan 
we never mentioned to motorola that toshiba didnt want 
motorola to produce the chip in the united states if motorola 
wanted to make the chip there it could have its their decision 
not ours said tedsou kadoya general manager of public 
communications for toshiba america inc 
motorola also produces computers pagers cellular phones 
twoway radios and defense and aerospace electronics

diplomatic talks between the united states and iraq would succeed 
gold was higher but silver prices sank below 4 an ounce on the 
lack of decisive war moves and a large selloff by institutional 
investors over the past few days silver has traded at the lowest 
price levels in 16 years 
the dollar strengthened as traders anticipated middle east 
saberrattling from president bush at a news conference but the 
currency eased in value when bushs comments showed he wasnt yet 
ready to scrap the diplomacy option 
bush scolded saddam hussein for failing to agree on a date for 
secretary of state james a baker iiis diplomatic trip to baghdad 
the dollar came off a little bit after overanticipating 
said francoise soareskemp manager of the corporate advisory desk 
at credit suisse in new york bush was tough but he didnt 
declare war in the next 24 hours 
overall the dollar gained against the yen which is generally 
weakened on middle east war fears because japans economy is so 
dependent on imported oil 
the dollar closed at 13285 yen in new york up from late 
thursdays 13217 in tokyo the dollar rose 057 yen to a closing 
13187 yen and later in london it was quoted at 13285 yen 
jitters in eastern europe particularly unrest in albania 
pumped up the dollar against european currencies 
there is some concern about european prospects with all this

some of the pressure off the dollar

from 19440 late thursday 
brokers said the dollar also got support from the 05 percent 
rise in the us producer price index for november when a gain of 
only 01 percent was expected the poor performance suggested the 
federal reserve may have less room to lower interest rates traders 
said 
higher interest rates generally make a currency more attractive 
beneath it all though the market retained a bearish tone amid 
the potential for outside events including the declining us 
economy to weaken the dollar 
there is room for the dollar to go lower from both an 
economic standpoint and also if peace breaks out in the middle 
east said jack barbanel managing director for first global

charles keating jrs insurance companies should 
be required to pay part of any courtordered damages arising from 
the collapse of keatings financial empire a classaction lawsuit 
contends 
the suit was filed in us district court by the federal 
government and investors in keatings phoenixbased american 
continental corp it contends that 21 insurance companies are 
liable for as much as 110 million 
the policies impose an obligation on the respective insurance 
company defendants to provide insurance coverage for the acts of 
the insured defendants that caused damage and losses to the 
plaintiffs the lawsuit says 
the suit asks that the court to determine immediately the 
scope and amount of coverage the policies provide 
the suit was filed by four investors and the resolution trust 
corp the federal agency empowered to dispose of the assets of 
failed savings and loans it was brought on behalf of more than 
20000 people who bought american continental junk bonds through 
lincoln savings and loan association keatings californiabased 
thrift 
federal regulators seized lincoln savings in april 1989 one day 
after american continental and 11 of the thrifts subsidiaries 
filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
keating members of his family and his former top executives are 
defendants in lawsuits filed by the government and investors 
seeking more than 13 billion in damages 
the federal government is seeking 11 billion in a fraud and 
racketeering suit that blames keating and his associates for the 
failure of lincoln savings 
in a separate suit more than 17000 investors who put about 
200 million into american continental securities are demanding 
their money back 
the 21 insurance companies named as defendants in the 
classaction suit filed thursday sold policies covering actions 
taken by keating and his executives that can be tied to the 
collapse of american continental and lincoln savings according to 
the suit 
the insurance companies contend that some of the policies are 
self consuming which means the proceeds are being used to pay 
the legal bills run up by keating and the others in various civil 
suits 
the lawsuit argues however that policy provisions that allow 
deductions for legal fees are vague ambiguous and unenforceable 
as a result of this dispute proceeds of certain policies are 
wasting and elderly plaintiffs are losing their rights to certain 
recoveries the lawsuit says unless this court determines the 
rights and obligations of the parties many of the insurance 
policies may be wasted or diminished to zero 
a federal judge last may ordered national union fire insurance 
co of pittsburgh one of the insurance companies to pay for legal 
bills of keating and his associates under two of its policies 
the investors requested each insurer last may to deposit the 
amount of the policies into interestbearing accounts to pay any 
courtawarded damages but the companies have been reluctant to do 
so the suit contends 
the suit was assigned to judge richard bilby and probably will 
be consolidated with other pending keating suits according to the 
court clerks office

beleaguered eastern airlines continued as 
recently as last month to falsify vital safety and maintenance 
records according to a confidential informant cited in a 
government document unsealed friday 
eastern angrily denied the charges contained in the document an 
affidavit to support a lawenforcement raid earlier this month on 
easterns miami headquarters it details a lengthy pattern of 
doctoring safety logs and other records to keep the airlines jets 
in the air 
release of the document was a publicrelations setback for 
eastern which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection 
since march 1989 because of a strike that has still not been 
resolved 
eastern insisted there has been no conspiracy to cut corners on 
safety as the government has charged in a criminal case in 
brooklyn 
in response to the latest allegations easterns courtappointed 
trustee martin r shugrue jr said that the government has a 
personal vendetta against him and a vendetta against the 
company 
eastern has continued to lose enormous amounts of money but 
shugrue has predicted the troubled carrier will start breaking even 
sometime next year shugrue has been leading an aggressive 
publicity campaign for eastern in attempt to win more customers 
during a miami news conference friday shugrue was visibly 
shaking his voice rose in anger at times as he accused the 
government of embarking on a headlinehunting exercise to 
damage eastern 
eastern said the faas most recent inspections revealed that 
eastern was safe and that there was no evidence to suggest that 
maintenance records were being falsified 
the airline said that based on its own investigation of specific 
allegations it was confident that a grand jury would agree that 
the charges contained in the affidavit are without merit 
federal investigators armed with a search warrant went into 
easterns offices on dec 1 and carried out boxes of documents and 
computer records according to andrew j maloney us attorney for 
the eastern district of new york 
according to a confidential informant eastern supervisors are 
under so much pressure to avoid delays that record falsification is 
the norm the affidavit said 
maintenance workers at hartsfield airport in atlanta routinely 
falsified log books to hide faulty navigation radar and other 
electronic equipment as well as bad tires and windshields that 
leaked air informants were quoted by investigators as saying in 
the document 
confidential informants told investigators that flight delays 
caused by necessary repairs or maintenance were simply not 
tolerated by easterns upper management the document said 
one confidential informant in atlanta said he witnessed 
supervisors on almost a daily basis falsifying log books to make it 
appear that inoperative cockpit instruments had been repaired when 
in reality they had not been repaired the affidavit said 
in a pointbypoint denial of the allegations eastern said it 
believed much of the information had come from 13 machinists nine 
of whom have been on strike since 1989 some of the information 
came from an employee who had been involved a dispute with the 
company over a disciplinary action eastern said 
last friday us district judge i leo glasser of brooklyn 
ruled the affidavit unsealed friday should be made public however 
he put his ruling on hold to allow eastern a chance to appeal 
the appeal went before a threejudge panel of the us court of 
appeals in manhattan on thursday the appelate court ruled friday 
that the document should be made public 
in july federal prosecutors in brooklyn filed criminal charges 
against eastern alleging a pattern of falsifying safety records 
and other maintenance documents to keep its jets in the air 
the airline and several of its top managers are scheduled to be 
tried next year 
travel agents said easterns bookings are not likely to 
immediately fall off after fridays disclosure of the affidavit 
although news stories about the document could raise concerns among 
some travelers 
very often we tend to see that unless theres some very 
dramatic and negative aspect to some carrier that what seems to 
drive the consumer more than any other factor is the price said 
h wayne berens president of revere travel inc in trenton nj 
berens said many of his customers who have flown eastern 
recently believe they have gotten good value

president bush said friday he would nominate 
rep lynn martin of illinois to head the labor department choosing 
a longtime friend who lost her congressional seat last month in a 
failed senate bid 
the choice of martin to replace elizabeth dole who resigned to 
head the american red cross will assure the continuing presence of 
at least one woman in bushs cabinet 
another congresswoman defeated in an effort to unseat a 
democratic senator patricia saiki of hawaii is considered a 
frontrunner for the top position at the education department where 
lauro cavazos was forced to resign this week 
bush called martin 51 a distinguished public servant and 
cherished friend the president was scheduled to meet with martin 
at the white house on monday 
the announcement got a somewhat chillier reception from labor 
leaders lane kirkland president of the 142 millionmember 
aflcio said that during her 10year tenure in congress her voting 
record has not reflected a sensitivity to the needs of workers 
bushs announcement made hastily before he boarded a helicopter 
for camp david md appeared designed to end a week of turmoil 
within the administration on a positive note 
cavazos resigned wednesday after being told to leave by white 
house chief of staff john sununu according to administration 
sources and bushs choice as the new republican party chairman 
william bennett bowed out thursday when he found out how 
drastically new ethics rules would limit his outside income 
martin in illinois on friday was informed only an hour ahead 
of the formal announcement that she had landed the job an 
administration source said martin declined to be interviewed but 
issued a brief statement saying her nomination was a high 
honor 
i look forward to appearing before the senate for the upcoming 
confirmation hearings she said thanking bush for his 
confidence and support 
sen edward m kennedy dmass whose senate labor and human 
resources committee will hold martins confirmation hearings 
commended her on her nomination he said the department needs 
someone who could stand up for hardpressed families against the 
constant probusiness tilt of the white house 
in making his announcement bush said martin had served as an 
unofficial adviser to him on legislative matters in the past 
she backed him in his first presidential bid in 1980 helped him 
prepare for his vice presidential debate with democrat geraldine 
ferraro in 1984 and was a national cochairman of his presidential 
campaign two years ago 
it was also apparent that bush felt he owed her something for 
her party loyalty in giving up a safe house seat to make the uphill 
bid against sen paul simon she had been passed over in bushs 
first round of cabinet appointments after the 1988 election partly 
because of her own interest in the senate 
shes a mother who knows the need for child care shes a 
professional who understands the businesslabor relationship and 
as a congresswoman she spent years dealing with the concerns and 
aspirations of the working americans from every walk of life 
bush said 
rep saiki had also been considered in the running for the labor 
post as well as for the education slot 
martin and saiki were seen as likely nominees for several 
reasons political analysts said they are women they are seen as 
being owed something because they gave up house seats with bushs 
encouragement to make the senate bids and as capitol veterans 
they could help him push administration policy in congress 
in addition saiki an asianamerican would add a minority 
member to a cabinet that lost cavazos a hispanicamerican 
besides the cabinet openings before bush this week the 
highprofile job of rnc chairman was added to the equation when 
bennett the former drug policy director said hed changed his 
mind about taking the job 
three cabinet secretaries are among those frequently mentioned 
as contenders for the rnc post samuel skinner of transportation 
robert mosbacher of commerce and jack kemp of housing and urban 
development along with former rep thomas loeffler of texas and 
longtime bush campaign strategist rich bond 
if skinner mosbacher or kemp took the job that would give bush 
yet another cabinet opening to fill 
besides saiki those also considered potential choices for 
education secretary include lynne cheney chairwoman of the 
national endowment for the humanities former new jersey gov 
thomas kean now president of drew university and former tennessee 
gov lamar alexander now president of the university of tennessee 
cheney the wife of defense secretary dick cheney has also been 
mentioned as a candidate for the labor post 
martin has never had a close alliance with organized labor 
according to the aflcios scorecard she voted right on 
workers issues 29 percent of the time 
when bush tapped mrs dole for the labor post two years ago his 
action was seen as a way for republicans to mend fences with 
organized labor leaders who had had a hostile relationship with the 
reagan administration 
analysts say more cabinet changes might follow soon kemp 
skinner and mosbacher are all said to be itchy as well as attorney 
general dick thornburgh

donald trumps taj mahal casino 
resort met an extended deadline friday to throw together a 
restructuring agreement and hand it over to state gaming 
regulators 
the developers other two casinos face deadlines saturday to 
make bond payments analysts said one the trump castle probably 
wouldnt make its 184 million payment 
the trump plaza hotel and casino was likely to make its 161 
million bond payment they said both are due by midnight saturday 
the philadelphia inquirer reported in friday editions that trump 
plaza has just 17 million in the bank and trump castle has only 
18 million handy failure to make payments could throw the casinos 
in default and perhaps put them under the protection of bankruptcy 
court 
ed tracy the head of trumps three atlantic city casinos and 
one noncasino hotel would not comment on the status of the bond 
payments tenday grace periods to pay the bonds would not start 
until monday tracy said 
when we have something to say well say it tracy said 
the state casino control commission is only immediately 
concerned with the financial stability of the taj mahal and the 
prepackaged bankruptcy plan it intends to file and leave by 
the spring the commission has said it will likely look at the 
financial stability of the other two properties later 
fridays meeting began 1 hour and 40 minutes late as documents 
arrived at the last minute by facsimile machine attorneys from the 
state the trump organization taj mahal bondholders taj mahal 
subcontractors and banks sought to make sure they all agreed on the 
final terms of the documents 
commission chairman steve perskie stressed as he had in two 
previous hearings that delay in producing the taj mahal documents 
could threaten the license of the 8monthold casino the 
glitziest in atlantic city he had extended his wednesday deadline 
for the deals supporting documents until friday 
i am satisfied that with the submission of documents the 
licensee and other participants have met the conditions imposed by 
the commission perskie said 
the commission recognizes that a lot of people have lost a lot 
of sleep tempers might have been frayed and tensions might have 
been high he said but the public interest is served by 
certainty the schedule was neither arbitrary unfair nor as it 
turns out unreasonable 
state law makes the commission responsible for ensuring that 
each casino licensee remains financially stable the commission has 
the power to take away a license 
the casino commission wants to see the overall agreement by next 
wednesday trump officials have said they intend to file that with 
the federal securities and exchange commission by monday 
perskie said he would rule monday whether documents detailing 
the restructuring agreement should be released to the public other 
documents including certificates of incorporation and new bylaws 
were made public 
the taj mahal failed to make a 473 million payment due nov 15 
to bondholders only to reach a restructuring deal the day after 
the restructuring reduces the interest rate on the 675 million 
in bonds from 14 percent to 12 percent spreads their repayment 
date over ten years instead of eight and gives bondholders half 
ownership in the taj mahal 
trump who has not attended the hearings can raise his 50 
percent ownership to up to 80 percent if he can repay the bonds at 
rates higher than the restructured 12 percent 
the taj mahal has set gross gaming records since its opening 
but it has failed to consistently make the 13 million a day 
that analysts said it needed to break even 
in a market already weakened by the recession the taj mahal has 
siphoned away gaming business from the 11 other casinos including 
trumps other two properties 
raymond neidl a bond analyst with dillon read amp co in new 
york said it does not appear trump castle would make its payment 
leaving open the possibility of a restructuring or bankruptcy 
the market is assuming the payment is not going to be made 
neidl said 
he said the situation looked better for trump plaza which is in 
the center of the boardwalk area and is considered a more 
attractive propoerty than the trump castle

per share the company said international paper reported 546 
million in earnings or 501 per share in the first nine months

earmarked for paying for environmental controls at several 
woodtreating plants and for personnel costs associated with
