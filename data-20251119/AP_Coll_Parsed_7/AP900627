the house on tuesday rejected legislation 
to protect homosexuals from harassment after an ugly debate in 
which one lawmaker labeled colleagues bigots and others called gay 
men and lesbians perverts 
the house defeated the measure 11880 its sponsor rep babette 
josephs a democrat said after the vote she was unsure what move 
to take next but vowed not to let the issue die 
under the measure the same state law that gives special 
protection to religious racial and ethnic groups would have been 
extended to include homosexuals 
the bill would have extended the tougher penalties for bias 
crimes to protect people who are thought to be homosexual 
we have a growing and serious problem of violence against 
people perceived to be gay or lesbian ms josephs said the 
problem is real pervasive and growing 
in one of the most impassioned speeches of the debate rep 
thomas murphy jr said he was disturbed by discussion and jokes 
around him on the house floor slamming homosexuals 
this is bigotry in action you dont have to go a local bar or 
sports stadium to hear bigotry you can sit on the house floor and 
listen to it murphy said 
your snickers say youre bigoted you dont condone a 
different lifestyle 
opponents of the bill criticized not only the measure but also 
homosexuality 
i feel in my heart and in my gut that to pass this bill is 
wrong said rep howard fargo a republican its wrong to do 
anything legislatively to promote sexual perversion its wrong to 
do anything legislatively that would lead to the further 
deterioration of the traditional family and its values 
supporters said the issue was not one of morality but of law 
and order one group lobbying in favor of its passage the pride of 
philadelphia election committee which supports gay rights 
candidates had distributed a pack of letters from supporters 
including gov robert caseys administration 
rep karen ritter a democrat said pennsylvania had the most 
homosexualrelated murders in the nation last year 
we are not providing special treatment to perversion as has 
been suggested bigots who are unsure of their own sexuality have 
already singled out homosexuals for special treatment through 
violence ms ritter said

in a major effort to crack down on art thefts 
france has published the first catalog of art works stolen from its 
national collections 
the authors of the catalog found that most recent thefts were 
from museum storage rooms not exhibit halls and were probably 
inside jobs it lists 200 works stolen between 1979 and 1989 from 
museums throughout the country 
five hundred copies of the catalog are being distributed to 
police museum and customs officials art dealers auctioneers and 
experts in a new effort to track down stolen art and crack down on 
resale on the international market according to andre treps of the 
interior ministry 
written by museum curators jacqueline munck and vincent pomarede 
and published tuesday the catalog urges art professionals to take 
a more forthright approach to the problem 
too often people in charge of the art collections after a 
theft feel guilty and have an understandable desire to cover it 
up the curators wrote 
many french museums do not like to discuss art thefts and blame 
the media for falsely drawing attention to security problems 
they wrote 
the report however said that despite increased media coverage 
in recent months there has been no upsurge in thefts 
many museum officials may be uncomfortable with other findings 
published in the catalog such as the fact that 575 percent of 
the art works stolen from museums were taken out of storage rooms 
and the thefts were probably inside jobs only 40 percent of the 
works were actually removed from exhibition walls the report said 
stealing works from storage is a very peculiar crime usually 
committed by a guard or office worker not for financial gain but 
usually out of spite or the desire to have a souvenir to keep 
the report said 
the catalog lists the stolen works in alphabetical order 
provides photographs of each work says when and from where it was 
stolen and gives pertinent information on the artist 
the catalog published by the department of national museums and 
the interior ministry is to be updated on a regular basis

nine generations of cosmans six 
generations of clarkes and four generations of crists have worked 
the land of the hudson river valley sometimes their apple 
orchards have been bountiful sometimes they have not 
but generally they have kept their problems to themselves it 
is a measure of their fears for the future that they sought out 
reporters from the city to tour their farms and hear about their 
troubles 
the last two or three years apples have not made money 
said steve clarke from prospect hills orchard inc in milton 
consumers and farmers worry about chemicals farmers can get 
more money selling their land to developers than farming it 
competition from the northwest and abroad is squeezing their apples 
off store shelves and bad weather and pests of course never go 
away 
how do growers survive 
we go from year to year and look at the future and hope were 
going to be here larry cosman said at his mount airy farm in the 
hamlet of middle hope where he grows 250 acres of apple trees 
i think the odds are kind of against us in the sense that 
progress will prevail sooner or later and push out some of the 
farms he added later 
not that the farmers are railing against progress we brought 
you up here to show we dont have our heads in the sand said 
grower jeff crist 
farmers are adapting by getting closer to consumers like the 
pickyourown orchards at clarkes farm and with dwarf trees 
which can be planted more densely and pruned and picked more 
easily they also are starting sales organizations that market 
fruit from a group of farms and are selling directly to 
restaurants at farm markets and stands and abroad 
ten years ago it was enough to know what was going on in the 
confines of your orchard its not enough anymore said mike 
moriello of new paltz trying to be heard over joe porpiglias 
water dump which washes apples and sends them down to the waxer 
not all have adapted some have sold their land lot by lot 
its like theyre treading water said elizabeth ryan who 
owns a 35acre farm with her husband and is compiling oral 
histories of valley farmers 
in the 60s and 70s farmers sold their land but they sold 
it to farmers now they sell it to big real estate said 
porpiglia 60 as he looked out at farms that have been redeveloped 
for houses for sale signs are interspersed among the apple 
blossoms 
farmland preservation is fashionable but crists wife joy 
said that just saving land is not the point the emphasis needs 
to be on supporting and strengthening the farm business she said 
that means more research and development a good steady labor 
force and enough farmers so theres competition among businesses 
that support farms i dont see a lot of good active farms going 
out of business she said 
from the early 1800s growers in the hudson valley shipped many 
fruits by sloop south to new york city and points beyond including 
to south american countries now sending apples to the united states 
when larry cosman was a child wholesale buyers from new york 
city would travel the valley haggling with each farmer on his 
route 
in a 1938 booklet prepared for an apple blossom festival 
growers noted they had the best market in the world close at 
hand partly because city consumers cherished the fruits of 
upstate farms 
cosmans father sold happy bee apples with cheery 
oldfashioned stickers plastered on wooden boxes most went no 
farther than metropolitan new york 
in the 1930s ryan said there were 500 farms in ulster county 
on the hudsons western bank in 1990 there are fewer than 200 
family farms all along the valley from new york city to albany a 
140mile stretch 
in 1986 cosman 43 abandoned happy bee because he didnt have 
the volume to market his own label now his apples a dozen 
varieties from 40000 trees are hudson valley apples like his 
neighbors 
sometimes you talk about it and get a little choked up he 
said its a family name its part of you farming is not 
really a job its a lifestyle and most farmers live eat and 
breathe what theyre doing 
but the bottom line must prevail over sentiment its an 
international business cosman said and the hudson valley 
growers had to market their fruit together to compete with similar 
labels for michigan and washington state apples 
though exports remain a small slice of the us apple business 
13 million 42pound bushels in 1988 the cosmans sometimes export 
75 percent of a crop 
foreign climes seem very far away during a walk along latintown 
road in ulster county mcintosh and lesserknown types of apple 
trees spread out on all sides looking as if nothing could touch 
the serenity 
but alar did 
if you grow apples that changed your life forever ryan 
said 
on an emotional level it was a terrible upset all those 
guys in washington told us it was safe and we believed them we 
wanted to believe them said the cornelltrained pomologist or 
fruit specialist who did not use alar on her farm 
alar also known as daminozide is a growth regulator that 
slowed maturation and improved color and storage making it easier 
to manage harvests but even in february 1989 when the natural 
resources defense council issued its report linking alar and 
cancer few growers were using it said ulster county extension 
fruit expert warren smith 
nevertheless apple prices and sales fell growers still are 
trying to recover from losses estimated at 100 million 
like consumers cosman said farmers have a hard time figuring 
out which experts to believe but they respond to consumers and to 
costs moriello said and for chemicals the cost has gone up 30 
percent to 50 percent in recent years even though hes using less 
smith said all the valleys apple growers use integrated pest 
management a system that combines ecological nonchemical methods 
and natural predators with chemicals ideally fewer and fewer of 
them 
we have never recommended calendar spraying when other options 
are available he said would you take an aspirin if you didnt 
have a headache 
for these growers migranes are reserved for coping with apple 
prices though supermarkets were selling apples for up to 99 cents 
a pound mike moriello said he was paid 19 cents a pound wholesale 
preliminary figures for 1989 show washington state alone growing 
119 million bushels for eating and processing a glut that many 
growers say combined with the alar scare for a disastrous year 
michigan was second with 238 million bushels and new york third 
with 229 million 
farmers who made it this far intend to survive 
we have whittled away our farm population to 2 percent ryan 
said the people who are in agriculture now are the people who 
really want to do it theyre very insightful they balance an 
extreme number of risk factors that they dont control unlike a 
lot of other businesses 
there is one saying in the farm community these are the 
greatest gamblers in the world

the toyotas on american roads and the sonys 
in american rec rooms may soon be joined by fujis in american 
lunchboxes a japanesebred apple that seems to be the fruit of 
the future 
growers say japanese bud wood grafted onto trees in the central 
washington apple belt produces an apple that is crisper tastier 
and more durable than red delicious the industry standard since 
the 1920s 
the fujis also are bringing much higher wholesale prices not a 
minor consideration after three consecutive years of poor prices 
that have caused many growers to reassess the heartshaped red 
delicious 
there will be more change in the apple industry in the state 
of washington in the next 10 years than in the last 30 said 
brooke peterson a washington state university tree fruit extension 
agent in yakima county 
he likened washington apple growers who produce 60 percent of 
the nations crop to us automakers who were so big and so 
successful for so long that they failed to respond to the 
japanese challenge 
all of a sudden they are nipping us in the heels he said 
as a result growers must produce a better and more diversified 
product he said currently 70 percent of washingtons apple crop 
is red delicious 
were in a revolution in supplying the public with an apple 
more satisfactory to their needs said grady auvil a legendary 
grower from orondo who pioneered washington production of the tangy 
granny smith a decade ago 
auvil 84 and still out in his columbia river orchard every day 
is planting only fujis on his 500 acres now 
twenty to 30 percent of the time the red delicious arrives to 
consumers in poor condition auvil said 
the fuji first bred in japan 35 years ago has a longer shelf 
life and shrivels on the outside before it softens inside auvil 
said too often consumers complain of biting into a goodlooking 
red delicious that is mealy 
tastes in apples change just as tastes in clothing music or 
other products change some growers say where consumers once 
clamored for bright red colors and the heart shape now they are 
demanding better taste 
the oblongshaped fuji has dull red stripes over a 
greenishyellow base 
red delicious apples cover more than 120000 of the states 
160000 acres of apple orchards trees take several years to bear 
fruit so it will be some time before a flood of fujis hits 
supermarkets said chuck st john a spokesman for the washington 
apple commission 
he also said it is much too early to write off the red 
delicious it is not an inherently bad apple otherwise consumers 
wouldnt buy it he said we can grow red delicious and golden 
delicious better than they can be grown almost anyplace else in the 
world 
the red delicious first was produced in a midwest orchard in 
1870 and was transported to washington soon after by 1915 the 
state was the nations leading apple producer 
but growers are struggling two seasons ago the crop was 
severely damaged by excessive heat and last years sales and 
prices were hurt by the alar scare this year the record crop of 
78 million 42pound boxes of eating apples has been bringing prices 
beneath the cost of production 
where boxes of red delicious sell for about 10 per box 
wholesale fujis sell for up to 40 said jeff main of the market 
news service in yakima 
market news service does not officially record fuji prices 
because there are so few available he said but it is likely that 
will change in the next three or four years he said 
the fuji craze is reminiscent of the rush to plant granny smiths 
a decade ago that tart apple now accounts for 55 percent of the 
states crop 
when granny smiths debuted they too brought much higher 
prices now they are bringing about 15 per box still better than 
red delicious 
auvil predicts red delicious will go the way of the winesap in 
the next 30 years and will be replaced by the fuji 
it is the one sweet apple you can always deliver with good 
quality if it starts the trip in good quality he said

worry about domestic economic 
turmoil and the global crisis of communism is causing authorities 
to get even tougher with dissidents and people they dont trust 
vietnamese and western sources report 
the crackdown has included arrests tightened surveillance and 
suppression of the only legal dissident group the club of former 
resistance fighters at least half a dozen foreigners have been 
detained since april and two americans accused of antigovernment 
activity were deported 
sources said conservatives appeared to have gained the upper 
hand over those in the communist party leadership who favor 
economic and other reforms 
there is a tremendous sense of insecurity in top party 
ranks said a source with access to many officials there is a 
tightening up and everybody is more cautious and afraid to say 
anything they dont acknowledge it but you can see it in their 
faces 
on june 16 hanoi radio said the interior ministry 
counterintelligence force and police in coordination with the 
armed forces had promptly cracked down on many troublemaking and 
sabotage activities 
security forces caught 30 persons violating vietnamese law and 
discovered over 200 foreigners entering the country illegally 
the radio reported 
it said they destroyed five underground reactionary 
organizations and captured tens of their members and seized 
publications with reactionary contents 
many people have taken advantage of international 
organizations investing in vietnam to infiltrate and spy according 
to the broadcast thirty of more than 100 enterprises involved in 
joint ventures with foreign companies were found to be operating 
illegally it said 
hanoi radio said the crackdown was connected with major 
anniversaries an apparent reference to the 15th anniversary april 
30 of victory in the vietnam war and the centenary may 19 of the 
birth of independence leader ho chi minh authorities feared 
protests on both days but none materialized 
sources say dissident activity in vietnam is minimal and the 
actions reflect paranoia over the possible loss of political 
and economic support from the soviet union and eastern europe 
another factor they said was the bold challenge by prodemocracy 
demonstrators last year in china 
a hanoi radio report may 23 claimed the cia had subverted 
eastern europe and was trying to do the same in vietnam by 
circulating leaflets and employing tourists overseas vietnamese 
minority ethnic groups and catholics 
many noncommunist nations halted aid to vietnam after its 
invasion of cambodia in december 1978 
washington also forbids commercial dealings but businessmen 
from other western countries have flocked to vietnam in the 
increasingly open climate of the past two years 
the crackdown appears focused on ho chi minh city a southern 
commercial center that formerly was saigon capital of south 
vietnam 
for the first time in numerous visits to vietnam in recent 
years a reporters papers were searched before his flight left by 
a uniformed man introduced as a cultural officer 
when asked the reason for the search the man merely chuckled a 
government employee who was to help the journalist through customs 
appeared nervous and left early 
two wellconnected sources who demanded anonymity said they 
believed the tightening was temporary and did not mean an end to 
doi moi the communist partys 3yearold economic 
renovation program they added however that it might last 
until a national party congress expected in mid1991 
most of those detained were either close to the party or members 
of it the sources said the hanoi radio report said some 
confused and utopian party members had aided the alleged cia 
sabotage campaign 
an early sign of trouble in the party was tran xuan bachs 
expulsion in march from the ruling politburo after he supported 
greater democracy 
security forces also feared the decentralization of the economy 
and some political affairs had increased public discontent the 
sources reported 
farmers demanding land reform marched in ho chi minh city last 
year it was the first known street demonstrations under communist 
rule 
students have held campus protests of poor conditions at the 
universities 
hundreds of people protested at the city hall demanding 
repayment of money they invested in a perfume company that used 
liberalized rules to create a pyramid scheme 
smuggling corruption and crime have become major issues 
authorities decided the presence of foreigners would complicate 
matters and tightened visa rules in late april a vietnamese 
official said privately 
western businessmen said officials who once pleaded for 
investment had slowed things down and were preoccupied with 
ideological matters 
in interviews with the associated press authorities said there 
were no mass arrests 
no more than 10 vietnamese were arrested with businessman mike 
morrow one of the americans deported said nguyen son vice 
chairman of the information and ideological department in ho chi 
minh city 
gen tran cong man vice president of the vietnamese journalists 
association said there have been no mass arrests but many 
people were warned 
morrow said his interrogators were convinced he was a spy and 
that the united states was trying to create a tiananmen in 
vietnam a reference to the beijing prodemocracy demonstrations 
crushed a year ago 
the american who was held for three weeks before deportation 
said those arrested with him included do trung hieu a respected 
intellectual who belongs to the communist party 
miriam hershberger an american teacher in the capital hanoi 
was deported june 5 for allegedly trying to incite student unrest 
both americans were considered sympathetic to the government as 
was chan tin one of two catholic priests detained in may and 
accused of preaching anticommunism like hieu he was a leader of 
wartime opposition to the usbacked government of south vietnam 
the club of former resistance fighters is made up of southern 
war heroes and revolutionaries who criticize the partys postwar 
performance but have not questioned its leading role 
in march the clubs two leaders were expelled apparently on 
orders from the authorities a source reported he said the club 
approved a resolution in january criticizing the government and 
demanding more political reform 
nguyen son the ho chi minh city party official denied the 
report he said the clubs executive board expelled the leaders 
after they wrote and distributed documents calling for protests 
against the government 
son said one of the men ta ba tang was under temporary 
detention and the other nguyen ho was at home he did not make 
clear whether ho was under restrictions 
a british journalist who reported the clubs actions after 
interviewing tang and other members was detained briefly and 
several of his vietnamese contacts were reported arrested

kiko kawashima is a college student living in a 
small apartment with her parents but come friday japans 
modernday cinderella will call a palace her home 
in japans first royal wedding in six years the 23yearold 
miss kawashima is to wed emperor akihitos youngest son prince 
aya who is 24 and second in line to the chrysanthemum throne 
the wedding will be lavish the government has allotted nearly 
1 million and filled with traditions dating back more than 1000 
years 
but to a nation that only last year buried emperor hirohito 
whose 62year reign spanned a turbulent period of militarist 
expansionism and economic reconstruction the wedding also is being 
hailed as the first taste of a new era 
as far as the clearly smitten japanese media are concerned 
prince aya could not have chosen a better mate than kikosan 
who is only the second commoner to marry into the imperial family 
ayas mother empress michiko became the first in 1959 when she 
married emperor akihito who was then crown prince akihito 
ascended the throne immediately after hirohitos death on jan 7 
1989 
most of japans major television networks will broadcast live 
coverage of the ceremony and related events the wedding is 
scheduled to begin at 10 am and will be followed by several other 
ceremonies so television coverage will likely last well into the 
night 
along with the countless comparisons to cinderella miss 
kawashima has been dubbed the apartment princess because of her 
relatively humble abode faculty housing on the campus of tokyos 
gakushuin university 
at gakushuin miss kawashima is working on her masters degree 
in psychology her father tatsuhiko teaches economics there 
the former peers school boasts much of the imperial family and 
former nobility among its alumni it is where miss kawashima and 
her prince met in 1985 when he too was a gakushuin student 
since the engagement of aya and miss kawashima was formally 
announced in september flocks of reporters often have staked out 
the kawashimas threebedroom apartment 
they have tagged along as miss kawashima did her final 
prewedding shopping and even as she made a rare appearance at a 
bowling alley her score was reportedly about 100 
though the japanese and their media generally treat the monarchy 
with great deference photographing miss kawashimas mother hanging 
the family laundry out to dry is apparently acceptable as is 
broadcasting it to millions of television viewers 
aya who returned thursday from two years of zoology studies at 
englands oxford university has managed to avoid most of the media 
blitz 
palace officials say the somber 15minute wedding will begin 
with the sound of shrill classical japanese music the young 
couple attended by several chamberlains will slowly walk down a 
corridor to a wooden shrine at the imperial palace 
after aya makes his vows to the sun goddess amaterasu from whom 
legend says the imperial family descended the couple will sip rice 
wine to seal their marital bond 
later in the day they are to visit akihito and michiko to 
announce their marriage in keeping with tradition the emperor and 
empress will not be among the guests invited to the ceremony itself 
the guest list however does include such dignitaries as prime 
minister toshiki kaifu and the heads of the judicial and 
legislative branches of government 
the emperor is to bestow upon aya a new title to mark his 
marriage and creation of an independent household ayas given name 
is fumihito but japanese only rarely refer to him by that 
following three days of receptions and three more days to rest 
aya and miss kawashima will travel to the grand shrines of ise the 
central place of worship for believers of shinto japans 
indigenous religion 
before returning to tokyo where they will pay their respects at 
hirohitos mausoleum they also will visit the tomb dedicated to 
japans first emperor jimmu who according to legend began his 
reign in 660 bc 
police plan to mobilize 9000 officers to guard against leftist 
attacks and the public will have little chance to see the royal 
couple in person 
but a short parade from the imperial palace to the akasaka 
palace where the emperor and empress reside is planned

senators who defeated a constitutional 
amendment against burning the american flag say the uproar may have 
eased slightly in recent weeks but the issue remains a sore point 
with many voters 
its still a tough issue sen bob kerrey dneb said 
tuesday after the senates 5842 vote for the measure fell nine 
votes short of the twothirds margin required 
he said the dispute has opened a wound in this nation but 
voters are seeing that the fabric of american society has not 
been threatened by flag burners and in the end i think thats 
what turned this debate 
on the roll call 38 republicans voted for the amendment and 
seven opposed it among democrats 20 were for it and 35 against 
the vote was largely symbolic because the amendment which had 
president bushs backing also fell short of the necessary 
twothirds vote in the house last week democratic leaders attacked 
it as an infringement on freedom of speech 
the senate pushed ahead with a vote on the amendment even though 
house speaker thomas foley dwash had said he would not schedule 
a new vote in his chamber regardless of how the senate acted 
sponsors said they would keep campaigning for the amendment 
nevertheless 
well see what happens in the days and weeks and months 
ahead said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
he said americans were pained to see protesters show disrespect 
for the nation by burning the flag and had been counting on 
congress to settle the issue once and for all with a constitutional 
amendment 
in the heartland of america some folks just cant understand 
what congress is up to dole said 
sen strom thurmond rsc said the issue was so important 
that it should be sent to the states where the american people can 
decide whether they want to protect the flag 
sen howell heflin dala another amendment supporter said 
americanism cannot survive unless it has nationalism 
americanism must have sacred symbols 
critics of the proposed amendment said the senate vote was 
designed primarily to put them on record on an emotionally charged 
issue in a way that could be used by conservative challengers in 
fall election campaigns 
stirred by fears of sound bites and 30second spots members 
of congress who should know better are expressing a willingness to 
sacrifice the bill of rights for what they hope will be a benefit 
in the polls said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
sen dale bumpers dark said his mail had turned against the 
amendment and sen john glenn dohio said heavy debate over the 
issue in recent weeks may have changed some minds the more 
people learn about this the more they hear discussion and hear all 
of the ramifications the less likely they are to go for the 
amendment he said 
kerrey said after the vote that it doesnt feel like a 
victory it doesnt feel as good as it ought to because a wound 
has been opened in america a real wound 
the highly decorated vietnam veteran said many veterans feel 
strongly about the measure and as a result of his opposition they 
are disappointed they are disillusioned 
in the debate leading to the vote the senate rejected three 
rival plans 
it killed 937 a plan offered by judiciary committee chairman 
joseph r biden jr ddel that would have allowed congress to 
ban desecrating the flag in various prescribed ways such as 
trampling or mutilating 
the senate rejected 9010 a plan by sen jesse helms rnc 
to strip the supreme court of its power to decide flag desecration 
cases helms said it was needed to combat these kooks these 
loonies who burn the american flag 
and it rejected 5148 a proposal by bumpers that would have 
outlawed by statute any flag burning that could lead to a breach of 
the peace bumpers said the amendment as it came to the floor was 
too broad and would cover too many harmless uses of the flag

no more 1500 ringside seats or 200 dinners 
at le cirque forget the stretch limo hail a cab helicopter take 
the bus babe hard times are here for donald trump a man on a 
bankenforced allowance 
granted this is no ordinary budget reportedly 450000 per 
month 54 million a year or 1479452 a day enough to make the 
average guy drool the allowance is part of a deal with trumps 
bankers to keep his financial empire afloat 
but this will mean some sacrifices by a man not used to making 
them the millionaire developer reportedly spent 583000 on his 
extravagant lifestyle in may money above and beyond the 841000 
maintenance on his yacht and the 246000 upkeep on his private 
plane 
there are those who believe trump can make the necessary 
sacrifices to scrape by on his stipend 
donald trump has always lived and worked the lifestyle of the 
rich and famous and it will continue under the new 
circumstances predicted robin leach host of that syndicated tv 
show about the lifestyles of the youknowwho 
theres also good news from the authors of new york on 1000 
a day which would leave donald 1379452 a day to work with 
new york the possibilities are endless the solutions are 
only as limited as your own imagination 
now imagine these moneysaving tips donald provided free of 
charge 
no more chopper service to atlantic city a domenico tours bus 
can pick you up at broadway and 69th street just a 15block walk 
from trump tower bonus 10 in change and a 250 lunch coupon 
upon arrival at the trump plaza plus a 5 voucher good in 
september in case things get worse 
forget dinner at le cirque 150 and up for two or 21 70 for 
two entrees only they were once among ivanas favorites but 
theyre a little too pricey now two hot dogs and a soda from a 
pushcart go for 275 
cut back on your phone bill in trump the art of the deal 
you detail making more than 100 calls per day how many calls do 
you really want to return these days 
pack up the 1800 brioni suits and start buying off the rack 
stop seeing broadway shows at 55 a ticket and head to the bronx 
where yankee stadium bleacher seats are a mere 450 
get out of the boxing business before you end up like 
barechested promoter butch lewis losing your shirt 
trump writing in his book demonstrated there were some areas 
where hes frugal the donald doesnt drink which means no 
unsightly bar tabs and he rarely eats lunch just a can of 
tomato juice most days he said 
but life on a budget will be bothersome trump acknowledged as 
much in art of the deal when he observed if theres one 
thing ive learned about the rich its that they have a very low 
threshold for even the mildest discomfort

the double bill of singers mel torme and cleo 
laine was what a jazz festival concert should be both performers 
on stage all evening doing something special 
too often two performers perform separately before and after 
intermission and the audience gets the same show it would hear at 
a nightclub 
at carnegie hall on tuesday night during the jvc jazz festival 
the two superb jazz singers performed duets and traded solos what 
made the evening even more exciting were the innovative 
arrangements by john dankworth who also led a sixpiece band and 
played clarinet and saxophone 
songs from broadway shows plus some other songs embodied the 
concerts theme broadly broadway 
the performers started with lullaby of broadway then torme 
with vocal warmth and swinging lightly sang when theres a shine 
on your shoes miss laine went from low and sexy to really 
wailing on taking a chance on love 
torme sang a fine medley from guys and dolls and 
soliloquy from carousel the latter an interpretation which 
seemed more concerned with pretty top notes than content torme 
played piano on one number and drums on another with a showoff 
attitude which seemed not to rattle miss laines secure stage 
presence 
she was singing at her peak with rare phrasing and enunciation 
she made with every breath i take from city of angels 
mysterious and ended in the stratosphere impressed with fine 
and mellow 
torme who looked slim and trim sounded fine and mellow on 
bye bye blackbird which dankworth flavored with just enough 
saxophone noodling 
the two singers scatted together making lady be good 
exciting joined for i wish i were in love again and put i 
loves you porgy and bess you is my woman now into a smooth 
beautiful duet 
four hundred of the seats were priced at 250 and included a jam 
session by torme miss laine dankworth and other performers 
afterwards at michaels pub as a benefit for carnegie hall

freshman democratic rep ben jones is treading 
carefully as he explains to the folks in his generally republican 
district why he helped lead the fight against the constitutional 
amendment banning flag burning 
but so far the flag has not become the hot campaign issue some 
republicans predicted and even jones gop challenger is being 
careful in his criticism of jones vote 
georgias 4th congressional district includes atlanta suburbs 
and rural outlying areas it is mostly affluent and until last 
year its congressman was republican pat swindall who had one of 
the most conservative records in the house 
but under a perjury indictment swindally lost a bid for a third 
term in 1988 to jones an actor who played cooter in televisions 
dukes of hazzard 
jones has experience with touchy subjects he was the first to 
raise his alcoholic past in his two campaigns against swindall he 
also tackled the flag vote directly bringing it up monday in a 
talk in his hometown of covington 
leadership means you will have tough choices and sometimes 
will be very lonely jones told about 60 community business and 
government leaders at the leadership newton county meeting 
nobody likes flag burners jones said but a constitutional 
amendment would be an overreaction to a handful of malcontents 
members listened attentively to jones and gave him mixed 
reviews said bobby myhand the nonpartisan groups chairman 
some people agreed with him and some didnt myhand said 
with swindall appealing his perjury conviction the republican 
banner is being carried by state rep john linder the national gop 
has targeted linder for financial support 
linder blamed the defeat of the flagburning amendment on 
remnants of the me generation in the house 
i think jones has been voting like a leftwinger since hes 
been in there linder said 
lindner said the vote would be an issue but not the only issue 
in a district with an estimated 78000 veterans out of about 
400000 potential voters 
thus far linder has limited most of his criticism to answering 
questions about the vote rather than bringing up the subject 
im not going to wrap myself in the flag he said tuesday after 
a fundraiser in suburban atlanta with labor secretary elizabeth 
dole 
jones and rep john lewis datlanta were the only members of 
georgias congressional delegation to oppose the amendment in last 
weeks vote the proposal would have given congress and the states 
power to prohibit flag desecration 
atlantabased pollster claibourne darden said jones vote wont 
help him in the november election 
it was a stupid mistake were not dealing with right and 
wrong here were dealing with stupid and smart darden said 
bens a gunslinger he shoots from the hip and consequently 
he makes mistakes but that also makes it interesting 
elliott levitas the democrat who in 1984 lost the 4th district 
seat he held for 10 years said he doubted the flagprotection vote 
would determine the outcome of the race 
a lot of people who would vote against jones because of that 
issue would vote against him for three other reasons as well 
levitas said 
dekalb county chief executive officer manuel maloof a jones 
supporter said his stand on the amendment may help him 
knowing the district as he did and still standing up took the 
kind of courage you want to see in congress maaoof said it 
takes guts

a sharethewealth plan for oklahoma 
schools was soundly rejected in a special election tuesday as 
voters in the eastern and western sections of the state split 
sharply over the issue 
an aide to gov henry bellmon predicted a federal lawsuit would 
be filed challenging the disparity in oklahomas school funding 
system 
unfortunately well probably end up in federal court and the 
federal courts will write our funding laws instead of the people of 
oklahoma said the governors chief of staff andrew tevington 
the proposal listed on the ballot as state question 634 called 
for redistributing on a statewide basis oil and property tax 
revenue that now goes to local schools 
some western counties with large oil reserves and utility 
facilities were voting against the plan by margins of more than 
101 the measure was beaten badly in oklahoma city the states 
largest city and in most rural areas but was favored by a large 
margin in tulsa the second largest city 
proponents of 634 said it was needed to end a situation whereby 
some school districts receive little more than 2000 per student 
in funding and others get more than 10000 per student 
bellmon had said the present system was not defensible and 
warned that oklahoma could be subject to a lawsuit if it were not 
revised 
in april the state legislature approved a 223 million school 
funding and tax measure that included pay raises for teachers 
ending a statewide strike 
dan brown a financial consultant who led a citizen group that 
opposed state question 634 said he thought the outcome showed a 
basic distrust of the legislature 
i think they are dissatisfied with the overall approach of the 
legislature by trying to really forcefeed oklahomans brown 
said they did not trust the legislature to write a school 
funding formula that would be fair to all brown said 
voters also defeated three other state questions that would have 
changed how state school land money is handled removed antiquated 
language from the state constitution on school attendance and 
changed the membership of the state school board

george bushs taunting cry of readmylips 
nonewtaxes proved to be a dandy political slogan but a woefully 
inadequate prescription for the economy slammed by huge budget 
deficits that kept getting worse the president finally shut his 
mouth 
to the delight of democrats and the despair of republicans bush 
conceded tuesday that higher taxes would be required yes 
required if theres to be any hope of getting the deficit under 
control 
it was a major aboutface for bush who had steadfastly argued 
during the presidential campaign and at the white house that higher 
taxes would rob the country of economic growth 
putting the best face on developments the white house said bush 
was doing what he could to put a spark in the sluggish budget 
deficitreduction talks with congress predictably democrats had a 
different interpretation 
the charade is finally over chortled rep robert 
torricelli dnj 
the other shoe raised in the 1988 presidential campaign has 
just dropped torricelli said george bush has announced that 
hes raising taxes 
michael dukakis the democrat who lost to bush lamented i 
told the truth and i paid the price mr bush did not and were all 
now going to have to pay the price for that 
republicans mindful that they will have to answer to voters in 
november staged a quick revolt against bushs tax conversion 
a letter circulated by rep robert walker rpa a member of 
the house gop leadership declared mr president we were 
stunned by your announcement a tax increase is unacceptable 
ninety republicans more than half of the 176 house gop members 
hurried to sign the letter 
the white house quickly began to backpedal to deal with panicky 
republicans bushs chief of staff john sununu assured 
republicans that nothing had really changed that the presidents 
statement doesnt mean anything new 
but bushs own words said otherwise he said tax revenue 
increases would be necessary 
a cautious leader bush changed his mind on taxes not in a 
sudden swoop but slowly step by step 
when he first took office it appeared the deficit problem had 
peaked stabilizing at about 150 billion before beginning to nose 
down 
bush held the line on taxes his first year but then submitted a 
budget to congress last january that proposed 13 billion in 
increases he called them something else revenue enhancers and 
higher user fees 
instead of improving though the deficit crisis worsened 
largely because of sluggish economic growth and 
higherthanexpected interest rates 
the latest estimate both from the white house and congress is 
that unless something is done the deficit will soar past 200 
billion when the cost of the savings and loan bailout is included 
when budget negotiations began in the spring bush said 
everything was on the table did that mean he would go along with 
higher taxes bush refused to show his hand 
finally after an unannounced breakfast meeting with 
congressional leaders on tuesday bush released a statement 
removing his oncesolid prohibition on tax increases 
republicans cried that bush had robbed them of their best 
campaign ploy the same one he had used to beat dukakis 
rep bill schuette rmich who is using an antitax theme to 
try to oust democratic sen carl levin recoiled from bushs 
statement the presidents recipe for deficit reduction includes 
a fatal ingredient tax increases schuette said 
agreeing with bushs old philosophy schuette said a tax 
increase would be bad medicine for economic growth stall out the 
economy and put people out of work 
democrats of course were delighted by bushs change in course 
it was a successful tactic in 88 said rep beryl anthony 
dark chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee 
i think the president now has had a reality check anthony 
added hes had advisers around him saying this country is going 
down on your watch

what looks sexy in the evening what do people want 
to parade in and how rich do they want to appear 
it has a lot to do with the tenor of the times a stunning show 
at the musee de la mode galliera that opened monday and runs until 
october 28 gives an informative look at dream clothes for 
evening from 1850 through today 
from the waistcinching hourglassfigure frippery of the second 
empire through todays coatofmail armored mini by paco rabanne 
the show demonstrates how women have presented themselves at their 
fanciest 
the catalogue by the museums head curator catherine 
joindieterle and her assistant valerie guillaume explains 
conventions and lifestyles behind dressing up through eight major 
fashion periods 
with outfits from the museums archives other museums 
including new yorks metropolitan and major couture houses from 
chanel to lacroix the show furnishes a closeup retrospective of 
some of the worlds most opulent clothes set dramatically in the 
museums marble halls 
there also are ensembles from the wardrobes of famous women a 
yellow embroidered coat and gown by dior for princess grace of 
monaco in 1956 a jeweled satin strapless dior worn by the duchess 
of windsor 
ball dresses were very important under the second empire of 
louis napoleon and eugenie said ms joindieterle introducing 
the show from its chronological start 
there were also strict conventions such as you had to wear 
bosomrevealing decolletes to a ball but to the theatre or another 
function chests and arms had to be covered even by lace 
she pointed out several beautiful gowns with hooped skirts that 
had practical interchangeable jackets so the same outfit could 
be worn from lateday into the ball by switching the top 
when the empire collapsed entertaining went back home but 
clothes were no less rich as shown by bustled models that 
anglosaxons would identify as victorian 
from the belle epoque period up to world war i young girls wore 
white pink and lace 
but changes were coming in teagown styles and pantaloons 
said ms joindieterle 
athome entertaining was very much the thing in the early part 
of the century though women were beginning to go out to 
restaurants formerly reserved for coquettes or mistresses rather 
than wives and there were clothes for that too 
she pointed out a window full of extravagant hats seen around 
town before 1914 usually worn to the theatre and even 
provoking lawsuits since they kept people from seeing the play 
outfits for dancing the charleston in the roaring twenties show 
the period as stylish but unsexy with highnecked shapeless 
flappers by patou chanel and worth 
but legs were being bared to the knee and that was very 
daring at first joindieterle observed 
through the 1930s and up to the latest collections the show 
progresses with lessons in sociologicalfashion trends like the 
1950s return of the fullcrinolined debutante gown after the 
wars austerity it was important to dress up again said ms 
joindieterle 
its obvious what women thought of dressing up in the late 
sixties and early seventies she remarked not much 
the evening wear from the early sixties included a tiny 
miniskirted yellow ungaro suit mondrianpainting style dresses by 
saint laurent and cardin a micromini with cutouts and feathers 
by courreges 
but the couturiers saw the undressed trend coming back before 
the student revolutions of 1968 joindieterle said 
saint laurents black tuxedo evening suit looms in the room as a 
harbinger for what a woman can still wear out to a party without 
looking either over or underdressed 
the show also gives a nod to nearnudity with a saint laurent 
black chiffon and feathers from the seventies and to younger 
creators like jeanpaul gaultier with his brazen underwear look and 
claude montana whose ropy fishnet tops a mannequins bare bosom

the assembled schoolchildren 
hailed the declaration of the year of peace by tossing skyward 
50 doves 
the birds which had been too tightly clutched through hours of 
delayed ceremonies and president alfredo cristianis speech 
flapped and flailed and crashed to ungainly landings on the 
national legislatures parking lot 
but they eventually limbered their cramped wings they took 
flight 
like the schoolchildrens flock in the june 1 ceremony the 
difficult negotiating process intended to end 10 years of civil war 
in el salvador has also had a tough time getting off the ground 
but government and guerrilla negotiators on monday ended a week 
of talks in mexico that the un mediator said produced 
unprecedented movement both sides expressed guarded optimism that 
next months round could produce concrete accords to pave the way 
for a ceasefire before the years end 
the obstacles to a settlement are daunting and the climb is 
steeply uphill four efforts at negotiating peace between 1984 and 
1989 broke down over mutual recriminations of intransigence 
yet perhaps for the first time in the war both sides appear 
definitively convinced that military resolution of the conflict is 
impossible and that there is no alternative to goodfaith 
negotiation 
its the old question of whether the glass is half empty or 
half full said guerrilla negotiator salvador samayoa i prefer 
to see it as half full and not because of mere optimism but 
because conditions favor movement toward peace 
in november the rebels launched their biggest offensive of the 
war trying to spark insurrection that would topple the government 
failing that the offensive was designed to leave the insurgents 
entrenched in urban positions from which they could demand and 
obtain an expeditious negotiated solution 
the huge push was beaten back after three weeks the product of 
many months of preparation the offensive failed to define the 
wars outcome 
for its part the government is being nudged toward a negotiated 
solution by a combination of factors 
the guerrilla offensive although ultimately unsuccessful 
showed the military the rebels remain strong and motivated 
cristianis republican nationalist alliance wants to do well in 
legislative and municipal elections scheduled for march and 
expects the mantle of peacemaker would produce significant 
electoral dividends 
perhaps most important the us government that has funded the 
nearly bankrupt government and war effort has served notice it will 
not continue providing large sums merely to maintain the status quo 
the unmediated peace process addresses a sevenpoint agenda 
the top item of which is the future role of the armed forces the 
talks eventual success hinges on accord on that subject by far 
the most difficult 
el salvador is a small volcanostudded nation of 5 million on 
the pacific coast of central america notorious throughout its 
history for lopsided distribution of wealth 
the armed forces were for most of this century the key factor in 
ensuring that the few rich got richer while the many poor remained 
so 
relatively progressive younger officers staged a coup in 1979 
with the stated intention of modernizing and democratizing the 
country but the reform movement assailed on one side by oldline 
rightist officers degenerated into a bloody conflict with rebels 
wanting revolutionary change 
an estimated 72000 people most of them civilians have been 
killed in the war 
the farabundo marti national liberation front a leftist 
insurgent army of about 7000 fulltime combatants and perhaps 
twice as many parttime militia members is battling a usfunded 
force of 56000 soldiers and militarized police 
the fmln contends that despite periodic elections and democratic 
trappings the government is a civilian facade on military 
dictatorship 
though government officials describe el salvador as a fledgling 
democracy the armed forces enjoy a degree of power and privelege 
uncountenanced by any modern democratic system 
the rebels demand demilitarization of salvadoran society 
shafik handal leader of the rebel delegation in mexico said 
demilitarization includes disappearance of the insurgent army 
but before the guerrillas demobilize they demand first of all 
an end to military impunity 
although international rights organizations blame the armed 
forces for the slaying outside of combat of many thousands of 
suspected opponents not a single officer has been convicted or 
even tried for a rights abuse crime 
handal and other guerrilla chiefs acknowledge that trial and 
conviction of all or even most offenders is utopian and have 
centered demands for prosecution on four exemplary cases 
the rebels say identification of those responsible for egregious 
abuses and their administrative removal from positions of command 
would suffice as punishment for those implicated in crimes other 
than the four symbolic cases 
in addition to the purge the rebels demand abolishment of 
militarized police forces they consider repressive and creation of 
a new police force under civilian command and control 
agreements on the dismantling of paramilitary organizations 
drastic reduction in the number of military personnel and an end to 
forced recruitment are also rebel conditions for giving up the 
armed struggle 
oscar santamaria chief of the government delegation to the 
mexican talks told the associated press that the discussions 
produced advances that could pave the way for accords at the next 
round 
among elements contributing to chances for successful 
negotiations 
the united states supports the removal of tainted and corrupt 
officers government officials privately concur that once the war 
is over police forces should be under a civilian portfolio rather 
than the defense ministry 
and cristiani has pledged to significantly reduce military 
strength once peace is achieved 
if the military stumbling blocks are overcome the other issues 
human rights judicial and electoral reform constitutional 
revision and economic accords could follow relatively easily

the last time congress and president bush 
raised taxes for deficit reduction they put the bite on banks 
large corporations and defense contractors 
the whole package enacted last november cost taxpayers about 
8 billion a year but because of its scattergun approach nobody 
complained too loudly 
as a result of bushs announcement tuesday that tax increases 
will have to be part of any significant deficitreduction plan this 
year congressional leaders and the presidents advisers will be 
looking for the same kind of lowpain plan 
but that kind of tax increase may be hard to find this year 
simply because there is a limit to the number of loopholes that 
can be closed and corporate tax breaks that can be taken away 
after all president reagan signed similar tax increases in 1987 
and 1988 
many democrats in congress argue that the first target of any 
tax increase should be the rich we ought to look at those groups 
who have profited from the tax structure of the 1980s sen james 
sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee says 
one proposal that has drawn wide attention would tax part of the 
earnings of the richest 600000 americans at a maximum rate of 33 
percent all their taxable income now is taxed at 28 percent even 
though some earnings of those with less income may be taxed at 33 
percent 
some lawmakers insist however that while bush is backing away 
from his 1988 campaign pledge to oppose tax increases he is set 
solidly against raising personal income taxes 
higher gasoline taxes bush specifically rejected that idea in 
the 1988 campaign and there is strong opposition from rural 
lawmakers but it has considerable support in congress because it 
would not only raise 1 billion a year for each onecent increase 
but also assist in conserving energy 
how about raising taxes on cigarettes and beverage alcohol a 
higher cigarette tax is a good bet in part because of health costs 
associated with smoking but the tax on hard liquor already is 
considerably higher than on beer and wine and there is some 
reluctance in an election year to risk offending joe sixpack 
and the wineandcheese crowd 
the congressional budget office annually draws up a list of tax 
increase options but makes no recommendations here are some of 
this years candidates and what they would cost taxpayers in 1991 
indexing delay for one year the annual mandated tax cuts 
designed to keep costofliving pay raises from pushing workers 
into higher brackets 54 billion rep dan rostenkowski dill 
chairman of the house ways and means committee proposed it as part 
of a plan to require most americans to share the pain of deficit 
reduction 
state local taxes allow deduction only of property and income 
taxes that exceed 1 percent of adjusted gross income 700 million 
medicare extend the 145 percent medicare premium collected as 
part of the social security tax to wages above 51300 the 
present taxable maximum this would affect the wealthiest 6 percent 
of employees 35 billion bush has a separate proposal that is 
unpopular in congress require all state and local government 
workers to pay for medicare those hired before april 1 1986 are 
now exempt 12 billion 
fringe benefits impose a 3 percent tax on the value of 
employerpaid fringe benefits except pensions 26 billion 
credit unions tax them just as banks are taxed 400 million 
environmental impose new taxes on a wide variety of pollutants 
rostenkowski proposed 32 billion from this source 
business meals allow a deduction for only 50 percent rather 
than the current 80 percent of the cost of business meals and 
entertainment 2 billion 
stocks impose a 50cent tax on the sale of each 100 worth of 
stocks and other securities 78 billion 
mortgages limit the interest deduction for home mortgages to 
12000 on a single return and 20000 on a joint return 600 
million 
aviation raise the 8 percent tax on domestic airline tickets to 
10 percent with similar increases for air cargo and fuel as bush 
has proposed 500 million 
energy tax all energy at 5 percent of value 142 billion or 
tax all imported oil at 5 a barrel 85 billion 
energy industry repeal immediate deduction of certain 
intangible drilling costs such as labor claimed by oil and gas 
explorers 500 million

the louisiana senate ignored a 
threatened gubernatorial veto in passing what would be the nations 
strictest state abortion law a measure outlawing abortion even in 
cases of rape or incest 
theres no indication at all that hes changed his mind about 
a veto gov buddy roemers spokesman rusty jabour said 
tuesday roemer has said he would veto any bill that does not 
include exceptions for rape and incest 
the bill would send doctors who perform abortions to prison for 
up to 10 years of hard labor women who obtain abortions would not 
be prosecuted 
the house passed a version of the bill last week and was to get 
the measure again possibly as early as today to vote on 
amendments the senate added to clarify that abortion would be 
allowed to save the life of the mother 
the bill is designed as a direct challenge to the 1973 us 
supreme court ruling in roe vs wade that recognized the right to 
an abortion abortion foes see the louisiana measure as a way to 
get the court to reconsider 
to find out that the supreme court really believes we need a 
law that flies in the face of roe vs wade says mike cross 
senate sponsor of the bill 
if roemer vetoes the measure antiabortion forces said they 
will seek an override 
the 104member house approved the bill 7427 four votes more 
than the twothirds majority needed for an override the vote in 
the 39member senate on tuesday was 2415 two votes shy of what 
would be needed for an override 
we know who we have to work on said rep woody jenkins the 
bills author 
we know we have the governors veto and we know we have the 
votes to sustain it said robin rothrock leader of an 
abortionrights coalition 
sen ron landry a democrat offered an amendment to allow 
firsttrimester abortions for rape and incest but he lost 1227 on 
one try and 1326 on another 
about 200 abortion opponents packed the balcony and either side 
of the senate chamber during the sometimes emotional 4hour 
debate they broke into thunderous applause and cheers after the 
vote 
later about 70 abortion rights advocates marched from the 
capitol to the governors mansion nearby chanting prochoice 
slogans jubilant abortion opponents gathered on the capitol steps 
to congratulate jenkins 
during tuesdays debate several senators said the issue will be 
politically costly 
there are men in this senate who will vote on both sides 
who will be defeated because of their vote said sen fritz 
windhorst a democrat from new orleans who voted for the bill 
cross opening statement drew heavily on house testimony from a 
geneticist jerome lejeune of paris who contended that life begins 
at conception and that the fertilized egg already contains the 
genes to make a unique human being 
he held up a 3inchlong pink plastic model of a fetus and said 
this is what this bill is all about today whether or not these 
little boys and girls are going to have a chance to live 
but sen sydney nelson said parents must face agonizing 
decisions when faced with the impending birth of a defective child 
he also said some children are never adopted 
as a father and a lawyer and a christian ive reached the 
conclusion that this is not an appropriate bill for us to pass 
nelson said 
the debate came one day after the us supreme court upheld 
minnesota and ohio laws requiring minors to notify their parents or 
a judge before having an abortion

the nations broiler belt hasnt changed much 
over the years but the agriculture department says production is 
spilling over into other states 
for example oklahoma and missouri more than doubled the 
number of broilers they raised from 1980 to 1989 reflecting a 
spillover from adjoining arkansas a report said other states 
raising more broilers include tennessee south carolina and 
pennsylvania 
but the broiler industry is still concentrated in 10 states 
which accounted for 83 percent of the us output last year most 
are in the south which produced 48 billion birds in 1989 or 87 
percent of the total 
arkansas was the leader with about 920 million broilers last 
year followed by georgia with 812 million and alabama with 750 
million 
others states in the top 10 include north carolina mississippi 
texas maryland delaware california and virginia 
the report by lee christensen and agnes perez of the udsas 
economic research service was included in the july issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine 
although some of this spillover does not reflect major 
regional production shifts further growth in traditional broiler 
areas is becoming increasingly constrained by environmental and 
economic pressures the report said high concentrations of 
broilers result in increasingly complex problems associated with 
waste management water quality and animal disease 
also as city sprawl develops near major broiler production 
centers land prices and labor costs rise thus adding to operating 
costs 
areas with underemployed resources lighter population 
densities and fewer environmental pressures sometimes offer 
financial and other incentives to attract broiler complexes the 
report said 
broiler production grew from 37 billion pounds readytocook 
weight in 1960 to 173 billion pounds in 1989 this years output 
is estimated at 186 billion pounds 
industry development in the broiler belt was pushed by local 
entrepreneurs and aided by the readily available and relatively 
lowcost work force the report said in addition a warm 
climate helped reduce energy costs while growers used improved 
production technologies that adapted well to the south 
as production grew a large infrastructure of support developed 
including slaughter and processing plants 
the report said a 1989 industry survey of the 52 largest broiler 
companies showed that the largest four accounted for 45 percent of 
the total volume through 76 slaughter and further processing 
plants 
the survey also found that the top eight companies accounted for 
about 60 percent of the volume in 105 plants and that the largest 
20 firms had 80 percent of the volume in 156 plants 
approximately 75 percent of the slaughter plants surveyed were 
in the top 10 broiler states the report said

wind erosion eased its grip on the great 
plains this season because of improved moisture conditions in much 
of the region according to a final survey by the agriculture 
department 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said tuesday that an estimated 78 million acres were 
damaged by wind in the 10 states that make up the great plains 
down 45 percent from 143 million acres in 198889 
the agency measures wind damage during a sevenmonth season that 
runs from nov 1 through may 31 when winds are usually the 
strongest and soils the driest the survey covers 541 counties in 
the 10 states 
most of this decrease is the result of precipitation in 
colorado and kansas where land damaged from wind decreased from 
65 million acres last year to 463000 acres this year for the two 
states scaling said 
the greatest damage was in north dakota in its third year of 
severe drought he said the state reported 29 million acres 
damaged this season compared with 23 million last year and a 
record 35 million acres in 198788 
north dakota accounted for more than onethird of the total wind 
erosion in the 10state region 
kansas after setting a record with 51 million acres damaged 
last year largely because of a oneday storm that damaged nearly 
48 million acres reported only 190000 acres damaged this season 
the least damage was in nebraska with 130000 acres damaged 
compared with 192000 last year 
officials said the record for land damaged by wind in the great 
plains was 153 million acres in 195455 the year that the agency 
began annual records 
according to the survey the statebystate breakdown comparing 
winddamaged acres in 198990 with damage in 198889 included 
colorado 273731 and 1403655 
kansas 189600 and 5126250 
montana 1249665 and 1832025

an additional 11 million has been reallocated 
to 46 states for the agriculture departments special supplemental 
food program for women infants and children 
about half the states were running out of money for the program 
known as wic higher food costs especially for dairy and citrus 
products were said to be the main factors 
officials said tuesday the department regularly reallocates 
unspent and carryover wic funds to states in need or in danger of 
running out before the end of the fiscal year 
many states have managed their wic caseloads carefully enough 
that they arent having any budgetary problems said betty jo 
nelsen administrator of the departments food and nutrition 
service 
others have had to economize by choosing less expensive 
but nutritious foods she said 
nationally the reallocated money will allow states to provide 
an additional 300000 food packages to participants over the final 
three months of this fiscal year nelsen said 
the funds will be available to states july 1 and will supplement 
more than 2 billion allocated for wic in the current fiscal year 
that began last oct 1 more than 45 million women infants and 
children participate

just as in the american civil rights movement 
a quarter century ago the question of violence versus nonviolence 
in a struggle for human rights hung over nelson mandelas visit to 
washington 
the black south african leader received a thunderous ovation 
after a speech to a joint session of congress on tuesday a 
reception that left him pausing in the aisle afterward to wave to 
members of congress and the crowded gallery 
behind him a white republican rep chris shays of connecticut 
slapped high fives with black congressmen 
rep john lewis a democrat from georgia couldnt help but feel 
a bit of astonishment at the scene lewis is a veteran of the civil 
rights struggle of the 1960s who remained dedicated to nonviolence 
despite 40 arrests and vicious attacks during the freedom rides and 
elsewhere 
his last arrest lewis recalled after mandelas speech was in 
january 1966 outside the south african information center in new 
york city he and other members of the student nonviolent 
coordinating committee were protesting south africas apartheid 
system and its imprisonment of mandela 
i never thought id live to see nelson mandela out of jail 
lewis said 
mandela who spent 27 years imprisoned made only slight 
reference to the use of violence as a tool in the black struggle 
against south africas racist system he said those who care to 
worry about violence in our country as we do should look not at 
blacks who are denied full rights but at whites steeped in the 
ideology of racism 
but the issue of violence remained a point of disagreement after 
mandelas visit with president bush and his meetings with members 
of congress 
several lawmakers echoed bushs call for mandela to renounce 
violence a step the black leader would not take 
mandela has been given plenty of opportunities to renounce 
violence he has not said rep william broomfield rmich 
i hope thats coming in the future said sen sam nunn dga 
lewis who is black said he also wanted mandela to renounce 
violence 
i would like to see a nonviolent revolution a peaceful 
transition in south africa he said theres been too much 
violence too much bloodshed 
mandelas next stop on his us tour is atlanta where he is to 
visit the burial place of martin luther king jr the museum that 
honors his life and the ebenezer baptist church pulpit where he 
preached his message of nonviolent struggle against segregation 
i hope by going to the south he will see whats happened in a 
region where there was discrimination segregation lewis said 
he will be in a region of the country that was a lot like south 
africa just a few years ago 
without violence we were able to turn the south into a new 
south he said maybe being there will give him the will to 
try as much as possible to avert violence 
watching mandelas speech from the house gallery was jesse 
jackson 
in an interview afterward jackson accused bush of hypocrisy for 
pressing the issue of nonviolence 
he said bush has used violence by invading panama and by sending 
weapons to jonas savimbi leader of the angolan rebels 
his use of the word violence was diversionary from 
apartheid just as his using the word quotas is diversionary from 
the issue of signing the 1990 civil rights bill jackson said 
if south african president fw de klerk is not making the 
renunciation of violence the precondition to negotiations 
because he cant morally justify it neither should mandela have to 
do that jackson said 
mandela has advocated the use of violence only as a last resort 
said edwin dorn deputy director of the joint center for political 
studies a black think tank 
im perplexed at this administrations preoccupation with that 
subject dorn said the administration has not shied away from 
the use of violence in other parts of the world 
rather than comparing the south african struggle over apartheid 
with the american struggle over civil rights dorn said a better 
analogy was to the us civil war and the fight against slavery 
lewis said he did not believe mandelas refusal to renounce 
violence damages his cause in the united states he cited mandelas 
calm demeanor and demonstration of no bitterness despite his own 
imprisonment 
thats very in keeping with the philosophy of nonviolence to 
be able to forgive and go on lewis said

teachers union leader paul hubbert won 
the democratic nomination for governor in a caustic campaign 
against attorney general don siegelman and will face gov guy hunt 
in november 
the democrats clasped hands in a show of unity after the runoff 
tuesday and hubbert said i think the nightmare of 1986 is 
over a reference to the party split that enabled hunt to become 
alabamas first gop governor this century 
for those misguided souls who think the democrats are not 
together hubbert said theyve got another think coming in 
november 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting hubbert received an 
unofficial 307982 votes or 54 percent to 266213 votes or 46 
percent for siegelman 
hubbert 54 spent 21 years building the alabama education 
association into a political force with 70000 members ranging from 
janitors and bus drivers to teachers and professors 
making his first run for statewide public office he led a 
sixcandidate field in the primary june 5 but failed to win a 
majority requiring tuesdays runoff between the two top 
votegetters 
siegelman a 44yearold statehouse veteran made a trip to 
hubberts victory celebration to pledge his support 
a new battle begins tomorrow he said we will bring 
alabama into the new south with a democratic progressive governor 
in office 
during the threeweek runoff campaign siegelman attacked 
hubbert as a special interest backroom operator who helped 
teachers at the expense of children hubbert accused siegelman of 
running a racist radio commercial 
hubbert traveled with a mop and bucket in hand as he urged 
siegelman to clean up the campaign hubbert also made joking 
references to siegelmans use of marijuana in college 
hubbert said the negative ads and verbal slugging in the runoff 
wont hurt his campaign against hunt who won renomination against 
token opposition june 5 
hunt a 56yearold fruit farmer and preacher who was a 
littleknown figure when he was catapulted into the governors 
office in a 1986 landslide predicted a tough campaign 
but he added i think by the time the summers over the 
people will know the difference between the candidates

scientific efforts to save the worlds tigers 
finally yielded tangible results a wiggly yellow and black 
testtube cub named mary alice 
the 20pound bengal tiger one of three cubs produced by in 
vitro fertilization was introduced at the national zoo on tuesday 
mary alice the only cub that survived was born on april 27 by 
cesarean section from a surrogate siberian tiger 
her birth marks a milestone in efforts by zoos to save rare 
tigers from extinction using in vitro fertilization today there 
are fewer tigers in the wild than in the worlds zoos including 
only 31 blackfooted cats 21 sand cats and 12 pallas cats in zoos 
this is a celebration of what we think is a great scientific 
achievement said david wildt chief reproductive physiologist at 
the national zoo we can produce cubs by animals who are no 
longer fertile or have been apart for a long time 
natural feline reproduction in zoos hasnt been successful 
because most cats are picky about mates and sometimes refuse to 
breed naturally genetically desirable mates often are some 
distance away and transporting them is risky said officials at the 
zoos center for new opportunities in animal health sciences 
of the 37 species of felines all are threatened or endangered 
with extinction except the domestic cat since 1969 three 
subspecies of tigers have become extinct center officials said 
animals are considered endangered if they are not reproducing 
quickly enough and if their numbers are declining rapidly 
scientists have been trying to adapt human artificial 
reproduction techniques to wild animals for nearly 10 years said 
robert hoage the national zoos public affairs director 
artificial breeding techniques have been successful in farm 
livestock but adapting the procedures to conserve rare species has 
been slow hoage said 
ann miller a member of the zoos reproductive physiology unit 
said the breeding is at a snails pace because scientists know so 
little about the basic reproductive characteristics of most 
wildlife species 
but zoos have seen some success including an indian desert cat 
born to a surrogate domestic cat using in vitro fertilization at 
the cincinnati zoo and a gaur calf born to a holstein cow through 
embryo transfer at the bronx zoo 
intervention has prevented many tiger species from becoming 
extinct in the wilderness zoo officials said 
sometimes people use the words captive and research as 
fourletter words said lee simmons director of nebraskas henry 
doorly zoo this animals relatives are captive in siberia and 
other countries the habitats for many animals are in isolated 
enclaves 
when natural habitats are destroyed tigers are limited to a 
small roaming area that keeps them isolated from other tiger 
species when they are isolated tigers inbreed and the species 
begins to die from reproductive problems juvenile mortality and 
disease susceptibility said simmons 
the national henry doorly and minnesota zoos have worked 
together on the tiger reproduction effort

opponents of a protective us sugar policy 
are citing bush administration support for their stand as they seek 
a 10 percent reduction in sugar price levels in the 1990 farm bill 
were advocating a small reduction in price that the 
administration supports rep thomas downey dny said tuesday 
downey gave an early taste of the debate that sugar beet and 
cane farmers will witness when floor action on the farm bill begins 
next month 
you have gotten away with murder and i dont blame you for 
wanting to continue it downey told a conference of the american 
sugar alliance 
he and rep willis gradison rohio faced off against reps 
jerry huckaby dla chairman of the house agriculture sugar 
subcommittee and rep arlan stangeland rminn in a panel 
discussion 
huckaby and stangeland strongly support the program that keeps 
us sugar prices higher than the world market but huckaby 
acknowledged that the administration is not as enthusiastic 
he said he feared the administration saw the sugar program as 
something that could be traded away in exchange for concessions 
from other countries during international trade talks aimed at 
reducing subsidies worldwide 
one of the arguments downey and gradison are using against the 
sugar program involves trade 
how can we over a long period of time as we move toward 
multitrade agreements sustain differences between agricultural 
and nonagricultural trade policies said gradison 
the current sugar policy which is extended through 1995 in the 
farm bill holds domestic prices at 22 cents a pound about 9 cents 
more than the average world price by controlling the amount of 
sugar that can be imported from sugarproducing nations 
downey said sugar is not so unique a commodity that it has to be 
treated differently from other products whose prices ebb and flow 
with the market 
but huckaby and stangeland contended that food differs from 
other items because is needed for human survival giving the 
government a responsibility to regulate supplies and prices 
we dont want feast or famine said huckaby 
furthermore he and stangeland said pricedistorting subsidies 
on sugar from europe necessitate us government protection of 
american growers 
stangeland said sugarproducing countries take what they need 
for themselves sell to preferred customers and the highest rates 
possible and then dump the rest on the world market at low prices 
often subsidized by their governments 
downey and gradison said that by protecting sugar producers in 
the united states where sugar is not an ideal crop the government 
is stifling economic development in countries that us officials 
say they want to help 
forty nations are allowed to export to the united states and 
each has a limit on the tonnage they can sell here many of the 
countries are desperately poor although they have excellent 
climates for growing sugar cane and could sell much more than their 
quota 
it doesnt make any sense to not allow sugar imports from 
countries we are paying foreign aid downey said

abbas taghizaden pointed to his new home 
a tent up an arid valley from the town where more than half his 
neighbors died last week 
i only have this and my land left so i dont know how i can 
build a house i dont know how i can live he said 
many others were in the same position 
virtually all of kelishoms mud brick houses collapsed in 
thursdays earthquake which killed up to 3000 of the towns 5000 
people 
across northwestern iran the earthquake devastated scores of 
similar villages whose impoverished residents had relied on 
traditional building materials such as mud bricks 
in larger towns and cities residents said tuesday that shoddy 
construction contributed to the high death toll 
in rasht on the caspian sea for example 60 people died when 
one of the citys most modern apartment buildings collapsed 
neighbors said 
dozens of relatives watched tuesday as huge cranes lifted 
portions of the crushed building searching for the bodies of 24 
people still missing 
some of my family are in there said a young soldier they 
havent found them yet maybe they are alive or maybe they are 
dead i dont know 
many of the relatives and neighbors said officials had allowed 
the builder to add a floor and that led to the structures 
collapse 
nearby a 40yearold factory stood without any visible damage 
much of the citys water supply remained out as workers repaired 
the main reservoir 
there is so much corruption this the water system should 
have withstood the earthquake an architecture student said 
throughout the city there was little damage to older buildings 
even those made of fragilelooking brick newer concrete buildings 
were seriously damaged 
the worsthit rural provinces were gilan and zanjan provinces 
where 342 villages towns and cities were demolished kelishom is 
in gilan 
of the houses that are damaged most were made of poor quality 
materials said gholam reza naghdi one of two medical school 
volunteers in the village helping the injured i think the reason 
for the huge damage was our poor economy for that reason we need 
help from other countries 
some victims blamed the government others defended it 
since the current government took over all we see is dying 
dying said a man who gave only his first name jalal some the 
government killed others died during the war with iraq now more 
died in the earthquake the economy is down to zero i hope we can 
have some change 
at kelishom a woman who lost eight members of her family in the 
quake expressed gratitude to the government for providing a tent 
and food 
but its cold at night she said i just hope that we will 
be able to move into our own houses again some day

a former commander who ordered the spraying of 
agent orange in vietnam says veterans arent the only ones to 
suffer from the governments refusal to recognize the herbicides 
trail of cancer and birth defects 
testifying tuesday before a house government operations 
subcommittee retired adm elmo r zumwalt jr said the 
governments attitude casts doubt on how honestly it is dealing 
with dioxin exposure in the environment 
agent orange used in highly concentrated form to remove crops 
and enemy cover was contaminated during its manufacture with 
dioxin an unwanted byproduct that the environmental protection 
agency considers to be a probable cause of cancer 
the federal centers for disease control however says it cannot 
study the health effects of agent orange exposure on veterans 
because it is impossible to determine reliably who was exposed when 
jungles were sprayed to deprive enemy troops of cover 
veterans groups contend that military records can match spraying 
activities with troop movements agent orange 
zumwalt who commanded naval forces in vietnam reported to 
veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski in may that the 
government and industry intentionally manipulated or withheld 
compelling information on the adverse health effects associated 
with exposure to the ingredients of agent orange 
key among those ingredients is dioxin although scientists at 
tuesdays hearing said other contaminants may also be blamed for 
cancers birth defects and other afflictions 
the flawed scientific studies and manipulated conclusions 
are not only unduly denying justice to vietnam veterans suffering 
from exposure to agent orange they are now standing in the way of 
a full disclosure to the american people of the likely health 
effects of exposure to toxic dioxins said zumwalt 
he reiterated charges by outside scientists that two influential 
industrysponsored studies on plant accidents used fraudulent data 
and that scientists refuse to use animal data clearly showing a 
connection between dioxin exposure and disease 
while dioxin apologists concede dioxins carcinogenic effects 
on animals they insist that humanity has a miraculous dispensation 
from the harmful effects dioxin wreaks on other species of the 
animal kingdom he said 
derwinski retained zumwalt last fall as an unpaid adviser to 
help resolve the agent orange question which has been debated for 
two decades 
since derwinski took over last year as head of the veterans 
affairs department compensation to veterans has begun 
without stating outright that agent orange exposure was the 
cause the va has decided to compensate the few thousand veterans 
with nonhodgkins lymphoma and softtissue sarcomas both rare 
forms of cancer 
zumwalt said in his report may 5 to derwinski that based on his 
review of scientific literature those two cancers and 25 other 
afflictions should be considered to be linked to agent orange 
derwinski chose zumwalt because of his unique position as a 
commander he ordered the herbicide to be used among those serving 
in vietnam at the time were zumwalts son elmo who later died of 
hodgkins disease and nonhodgkins lymphoma 
other witnesses said tuesday that more attention needs to be 
focused on both key ingredients of agent orange not just the one 
245t that was contaminated with dioxin 
they said the other ingredient 24d causes cancers and 
other ailments linked to agent orange evidence shows that 24d 
was also contaminated with harmful compounds some related to 
dioxin they said 
a socalled phenoxy herbicide 24d is sold over the counter to 
kill dandelions and other lawn weeds farmers use it against weeds 
in corn wheat rice and sorghum 
the farmchemical industry believes further research into 24d 
is needed but the weight of the evidence so far indicates the 
risk of harm is relatively small if it exists at all industry 
spokesman garry hamlin said in a telephone interview from 
indianapolis

sharp food price increases and rebate 
reductions will force nearly a quarter of a million lowincome 
pregnant women and children from a federal supplemental nutrition 
program according to a survey 
between march 1990 and september 1990 the end of the current 
fiscal year our survey found that at least 240000 participants 
would no longer be served by the wic program dennis bach 
president of the national association of wic directors said 
tuesday 
bach said at least 25 states already have begun reducing their 
monthly participation in the special supplemental food program for 
women infants and children known as wic 
the program provides needy women and children with vouchers 
redeemable at grocery stores for food including milk cheese 
juices and cereals 
since may 1989 the consumer price index shows that milk prices 
have risen 107 percent cheese costs have climbed 127 percent and 
fruit juices and frozen fruit prices have risen 138 percent 
congress has appropriated 21 billion for the current fiscal 
year bach said an additional 72 million was needed to prevent the 
reductions 
the house approved a fiscal 1991 increase of 235 million 
including 85 million to maintain current services and 150 million 
for program expansion 
but bach said the 150 million could be eaten up to maintain 
current levels

a new treatment for lifethreatening heartbeat 
irregularities is believed to be the first soviet drug licensed by 
a us pharmaceutical company and approved by the food and drug 
administration 
officials of du pont co said the drug which will be marketed 
under the brand name ethmozine is the most widely used in the 
soviet union to treat the heart condition known as ventricular 
arrhythmia 
the drug appears to be safer than the eight others in its class 
for patients who have had congestive heart failure company 
officials said 
side effects which include nausea and dizziness occurred in 10 
percent to 15 percent of patients said wilmington delbased du 
pont 
ethmozine also known generically as moricizine was one of 
three drugs studied by the national institutes of health in a 
clinical trial aimed at assessing the increased risk of sudden 
death in people who have an abnormal heart rhythm following a heart 
attack 
the two other drugs tambocor and enkaid were removed from the 
trial and new restrictions on them were ordered by the fda when 
researchers found that patients on the treatments were dying 
unexpectedly 
the trial is continuing with ethmozine along with placebos 
about 800000 to 12 million americans are being treated for 
lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmia said kurt landgraf 
worldwide director of du pont pharmaceuticals arrhythmias are 
related to more than 300000 deaths each year 
the drug developed in the soviet union in 1964 will be 
marketed by du pont under an agreement in which the soviets will 
receive royalties of 4 percent on worldwide sales landgraf said 
the drug will be available in the united states in september

tis the season to be careful lest lawn and 
garden work lead to lacerated feet and fingers or worse 
lawn mowers electric hedge trimmers and other power tools 
greatly ease the burden of caring for the outdoors but they also 
pose serious hazards for the unwary the federal consumer product 
safety commission warns 
newer lawn mowers have devices that cause the blade to stop 
turning when the operator lets go of the handle a system designed 
to prevent hand injury 
but many older mowers remain in use and owners of those 
machines can still lose fingers if they try to clean clogged grass 
of other problems while the motor is running 
the solution is simple stop the engine before doing anything 
beneath the mower deck even cleaning out a clogged grass chute it 
can pay to disconnect the spark plug so the motor cannot 
accidentally turn over 
and even with hanging guards mowers can still run over feet if 
operators are not careful the commission suggests always pushing 
mowers trying to pull them toward you rarely if ever 
in addition to the threat of cutting off fingers and toes the 
spinning blade can hurl such objects as small stones at high speed 
the safety commission urges keeping children and pets away from the 
area being mowed to prevent them being hit by such items 
stop the mower before crossing gravel driveways 
gasolinepowered movers present the added hazard of burns 
adding fuel to a hot mower is extremely dangerous say safety 
officials who warn that it can suddenly catch fire especially in 
the event of a spill 
in addition the muffler and other mower parts become very hot 
and can cause severe burns if touched 
electric mowers have a cord for power that can be a hazard if 
accidentally cut the commission adds 
with walkbehind mowers the safety commission suggests mowing 
across steep slopes never up and down 
hedge trimmers arent as dangerous as lawn mowers but can pose 
their own set of dangers the commission reports 
the danger of being cut by the blades is obvious of course 
those cuts seem to occur most often when people try to use trimmers 
with one hand 
before plugging in the trimmer check the onoff switch the 
commission reports that many accidental cuts occur when people plug 
the trimmer in while the switch is on and it starts running 
accidentally 
improper grounding or cutting the electric cord can also lead to 
electric shocks the commission says 
and officials urge that these machines not be operated around 
children and pets which can accidentally trip an adult or may be 
injured by the tool as they are not aware of the danger

chinese students fearing reprisals in 
their homeland will be allowed to stay in australia at least four 
more years but overall immigration quotas will be cut 10 percent 
as a result officials said today 
the joint announcement by prime minister bob hawke and 
immigration minister gerry hand followed a marathon cabinet meeting 
tuesday 
the decision will affect nearly 20000 chinese students who 
arrived by june 20 1989 a little more than two weeks after 
beijings bloody crackdown on its prodemocracy movement 
many of the students had expressed fears that they might be 
punished after they returned home 
according to the statement today future human rights conditions 
in china will dictate whether the chinese students can stay beyond 
four years or gain permanent residence 
the cabinet decision slashed the maximum number of new 
immigrants from 140000 a year to 126000 to make room for the 
chinese students expected to seek extensions on their stays in 
australia ethnic groups did not want further restrictions on 
alreadytight immigration levels 
the announcement was likely to draw widespread criticism from 
the political opposition students and leaders of other immigrant 
groups 
the students originally thought they would be allowed to stay 
permanently without condition after hawke announced june 6 that a 
separate immigration category would be created for them he then 
muddied the situation by saying they could stay temporarily but 
that none would be forced to go back to china 
the category announced today will allow the chinese to apply 
beginning in august for a special fouryear residency permit it 
will allow them to work and apply to have their families join them 
unless we were confident that the situation in china was 
such that human rights were no longer generally at risk permanent 
residence would be granted to those who apply subject to normal 
health and character checks after the fouryear extensions 
expire the government said today 
the chinese granted permanent residency would be part of the 
total number of immigrants allowed into this country of 16 million 
people not a special additional category 
cambodian groups were particularly incensed when hawke said on 
june 6 that cambodian boat people were seeking to better themselves 
economically and should not be granted refugee status 
although hawke said the cambodian immigrants would be sent home 
immigration officials later said any requests for refugee status 
would be considered on a casebycase basis 
the political opposition has said the immigration claims of 
chinese students also should be considered casebycase and should 
not be given blanket protection 
on june 34 last year chinese troops cleared central beijing of 
prodemocracy protesters killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
thousands of activists were subsequently arrested 
president bush in november vetoed a congressional measure that 
would have permitted any of the 40000 chinese students in the 
united states to remain after their visas run out if they fear 
reprisal back home 
bush fearing the measure would have further hurt uschinese 
relations instead signed an executive order in april saying 
chinese students would not be forced to return home 
bushs order directs the attorney general to defer until jan 1 
1994 any deportation procedings against chinese nationals who were 
in the united states on or after june 5 1989 and whose visas 
expire

investors mainly life insurance companies bought the yen against 
the dollar believing a statement by president bush would lead to 
lower us interest rates dealers said 
in washington on tuesday bush said tax revenue increases must 
be included in any deficitreduction package

politicians and academics meet thursday to 
try to defuse a constitutional crisis by agreeing on a more 
democratic system that would challenge four decades of oneparty 
rule 
an opposition leader predicted violence could result if the 
national affairs conference fails to find a way to give more power 
to native taiwanese who have been dominated by the ruling 
nationalist party that retreated to this island from mainland china 
in 1949 
president lee tenghui called for the conference in march after 
widespread public demonstrations demanding the scrapping of the 
system that has preserved the nationalists lock on power 
we would pay a very painful price should the conference fail 
to set the direction of reforms in accordance with public 
expectations said chen yunghsing acting chairman of the 
nations largest opposition group the democratic progressive party 
he warned of violent demonstrations in case of a deadlock 
the oneweek meeting will be attended by 150 delegates 
including 80 members of the ruling party and 16 representatives 
from the democratic progressive party independent academics and 
politicians account for the bulk of the remaining seats 
although president lee has not explicitly promised to follow 
recommendations made by the delegates it would be difficult for 
him to reject a proposal that had broad support from conference 
members 
the debate will focus on what to do with the 1947 constitution 
enacted in china by the nationalist government two years before it 
lost a civil war to the communists and retreated to the offshore 
island now home to 20 million people 
the nationalists have since used the constitution as the legal 
basis for their political power 
claiming to still be the legitimate government of all china the 
nationalists have not allowed native taiwanese to vote for a 
majority of seats in the national legislature and the electoral 
college instead the party froze in lawmakers elected on the 
chinese mainland more than four decades ago 
the nationalists have acknowledged the need for change as the 
aging lawmakers from the mainland die off and the increasingly 
affluent native taiwanese who account for 85 percent of the 
islands 20 million people demand more political power 
the nationalists are expected to propose changing the 
constitution so all members of parliament are elected in taiwan 
but the ruling party delegates appear divided over whether the 
electoral college should be replaced by presidential elections and 
whether the strong presidency should give way to a cabinetled 
government 
the democratic progressive party believes that just amending the 
constitution does not go far enough and wants to replace it with 
what they call a great charter of democracy 
opposition delegates say the charter would provide for direct 
presidential elections and allow the people of taiwan to determine 
whether they should drop reunification with mainland china as a 
national goal 
but taiwan independence is vehemently rejected by both the 
nationalists and the communist government in beijing which regards 
the island as a renegade province that must return to the fold 
perhaps that is why opposition party members suggest the issue 
of reunification be put off indefinitely 
we respect the rights and wisdom of our next generation and 
will leave some room for them to settle the matter said huang 
huanghsiung a conference delegate who heads the opposition 
partys constitution task force

china has released from prison a key adviser to 
zhao ziyang who was ousted as communist party chief for supporting 
some goals of last years crushed prodemocracy movement a 
newspaper reported today 
bao tong had been private secretary to the former party chief as 
well as heading a party think tank on reform 
the englishlanguage south china morning post said he was 
released from maximum security qincheng prison last month and is 
under house arrest in beijing 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources in beijing said an 
investigation of baos activity during last years protests yielded 
no incriminating information 
the paper claimed the failure to press charges against bao was a 
setback for hardliner premier li peng the report said authorities 
have yet to decide what to do with bao 
chinas official media has said nothing about baos case 
amnesty international reported that bao was arrested may 28 
1989 about one week before chinas conservative leaders ordered 
the military to crush prodemocracy protests 
zhao who was sympathetic to some of the students demands for 
greater political freedoms was dismissed from all his party posts 
june 24 1989 he was accused of supporting the turmoil a 
reference to the protests and of splitting the communist party 
zhao is believed to be living under house arrest in central 
beijing he has not been seen in public since may 1989 
bao director of the research center for reform of the political 
structure under the communist partys central committee reportedly 
acted as zhaos liaison to students during the protests 
one official evaluation of the protests reportedly labeled bao 
and other intellectuals as black hands behind the movement 
since late last year china has announced the release of more 
than 800 people jailed for their participation in the crushed 
democracy movement thousands more are believed still in jail most 
without being charged or brought to trial

young men in america are more than four times as 
likely to be homicide victims as those in 21 other industrialized 
nations and the reason probably is greater access to guns 
researchers say 
if the rate could be reduced to that of scotland the country 
with the next highest rate more than 3000 lives would be saved 
every year said two researchers at the national center for health 
statistics in hyattsville md 
but a criminology specialist said tuesday it may be unfair to 
compare us homicide rates to those of other countries as the 
study published today does 
comparisons carry the burden of different societies and legal 
systems etcetera james wright a tulane university sociologist 
said in a telephone interview tuesday from his new orleans office 
lois fingerhut and joel kleinman said in the study in todays 
journal of the american medical association that in 1987 there were 
4223 male homicide victims ages 15 to 24 in the united states or 
219 per 100000 
that compared to 22 victims or a rate of 50 per 100000 in 
scotland austrias 03 rate was the lowest 
fingerhut and kleinman said guns the cause of 75 percent of 
us deaths might explain the differences while there is no 
clear reason we have to look at the availability of firearms 
fingerhut said in a telephone interview 
france was second in gun homicides at 54 percent 
in washington tom wyld a spokesman for the national rifle 
association had no comment on the study 
but wright said the swiss own guns and have almost no violence 
they do emphasize responsible firearm ownership much more than we 
do he said 
according to the nchs study only one of 14 homicides in 
switzerland was by firearm 
and if you subtract all the firearm homicides were still 
killing loads more people than any other country wright said 
us homicides not involving firearms in 1987 outnumbered annual 
totals in all other countries combined 3to1 or 1036 to 308 
according to the study 
twenty percent of all us homicides occur in the 15 to 
24yearold age group the researchers said 
in the united states homicide is the leading cause of death 
among black males aged 15 to 24 years and the third leading 
cause after autombiles and suicide among white males ages 15 to 
24 the study said 
california had the highest homicide rate 220 per 100000 for 
young men among the 25 largest states texas was next with 209 
minnesota was lowest with 19 
new york had the highest percentage of firearm homicides 78 
percent of its homicides were committed with guns florida had the 
lowest 64 percent

presidentelect alberto fujimori flies to new 
york thursday seeking aid to help pull his country out of a crisis 
that has forced people to line up for scarce supplies of bread 
gasoline and other essentials 
officials blame the shortages on panicbuying and the plummeting 
value of the inti the countrys currency which makes imports more 
expensive 
meanwhile the government must deal with 20 billion in foreign 
debt and 2000 percent annual inflation 
people whose gas tanks are normally half empty are trying to 
fill them up every night housewives who normally store one gallon 
of kerosene are storing five pedro touzett general manager of 
the stateowned oil company petroperu told a news conference 
tuesday 
in lima housewives stood in blocklong lines to buy cooking 
gas children waited hours to buy fistsized loaves of bread 
hundreds of taxis and buses idled near the few open gas stations 
the inti lost value by the hour on the free market it has been 
devalued by 48 percent in one week and by 23 percent since monday 
morning 
the shortages come five weeks before fujimori is to be sworn in 
the agronomist a political unknown at the start of the election 
campaign defeated celebrated novelist mario vargas llosa in a june 
10 presidential runoff 
when he travels to new york on thursday fujimori plans to visit 
the united nations to seek emergency economic aid to finance food 
imports 
he will also travel to washington to meet with officials of the 
international monetary fund world bank and interamerican 
development bank he hopes to reestablish ties with international 
lenders that were broken by his predecessor alan garcia who 
limited payments on the countrys foreign debt 
fujimori the son of japanese immigrants will then travel tokyo 
for meetings with japanese leaders 
japan has said it is willing to resume loans to peru if the 
country can show a willingness to deal with its serious social and 
economic problems 
in lima the shortages have only added to the problems of the 
capitals 7 million residents who already suffer from daily 
blackouts severe water rationing and runaway inflation 
touzett said the shortage of electricity had increased demand 
for cooking gas and gasoline to power private generators the 
petroperu chief said the power shortages also hampered fuel 
distribution because gas stations cannot operate their pumps and 
natural gas bottlers their machinery 
the bread industry association attributed the bread shortages to 
reduced wheat imports peru imports all but 150000 tons of the 12 
million tons of wheat the country consumes each year 
once more we beg the government to import on a bigger scale 
and to do so continuously gilberto hinojosa teves of the bread 
industry association told reporters monday 
but economists say that many imports have been reduced because 
of a lack of foreign currency 
the government has been selling silver and gold to raise money 
the central bank reserves stand at 900 million mostly gold and 
silver 
centrist politician manuel moreyra said monday that the rapid 
devaluation of the inti was due to the governments unusual 
emission of bills as well as the uncertainty before political 
change 
the countrys problems have been compounded by a severe drought 
that has cut crop production and hydroelectric power and attacks 
by maoistinspired shining path guerrillas on power lines

nasa says it will run a fuel test on 
space shuttle atlantis on thursday to assure itself the rest of the 
shuttle fleet does not have hydrogen leaks like the one that has 
grounded columbia 
we believe that we dont have a generictype of a flaw that 
should indict the rest of the hardware in the fleet jack boykin 
deputy manager of johnson space centers orbiter projects office 
said tuesday 
we want to prove that to ourselves beyond any reasonable doubt 
because there is a potential safety hazard to having a hydrogen 
leak 
columbia has been grounded by a tiny fuel leak that forced nasa 
to scrub its mission may 30 six hours before liftoff hydrogen is 
highly combustible the shuttle was to have carried the 150 
million astro observatory 
the leak is in the area where the orbiter is connected to the 
big external fuel tank it is thought to be in a valve on the 
orbiter nasa said 
up to 200000 gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen will be 
pumped into atlantis external tank on thursday about half the 
tanks capacity to test its valve the same test helped nasa 
locate generally the leak in columbia 
its unclear whether nasa will launch atlantis on a secret 
military mission in midjuly if the exact cause of columbias 
problems have not been determined by then 
boykin said there are still folks in our community who arent 
committed to that yet the subject will be discussed during a 
flight readiness review on thursday and friday he said a launch 
date will then be announced 
in repairs on columbia a 17inchdiameter valve that carries 
liquid hydrogen from the external tank to the main engine was 
removed from the tank side but no leaks were found the problem 
consequently lies on the orbiter side and the valve from the 
unfinished shuttle endeavour will replace the bad component nasa 
said 
there is only one such valve on the orbiter side of the shuttle 
the valve on the external tank side is jettisoned along with the 
tank minutes after liftoff and a new valve accompanies every new 
tank 
columbias hydrogen lines indicated leakage during a mechanical 
test in 1984 to check the valve on the external tank side boykin 
said seven other valves including the one on atlantis also 
failed at that time 
the valve on the external tank side of columbia and the others 
that failed underwent yet another check each valve passed that 
test boykin said 
thirtythree of 64 valves made from 1980 to 1986 when the 
challenger explosion temporarily halted production leaked hydrogen 
during the mechanical test boykin said seventeen were within 
acceptable limits he said 
the remaining 16 went through the second test and passed boykin 
said nine went on to fly and performed well he said 
a similar test was performed with the valves on the orbiter side 
of the shuttles and no problems were detected boykin said 
the valve that apparently is leaking on columbia was modified 
following the challenger accident and has flown twice without any 
problems he said

the national assembly today approved a ban on all 
tobacco advertising and most liquor advertising starting in 1993 
the law approved on a 315149 vote forbids all direct or 
indirect advertising for tobacco products including sponsorships 
of sports and cultural events 
legislators from winegrowing regions succeeded in excluding 
most wines from the ban on liquor advertising 
all 270 assembly members of the governing socialist party backed 
the bill as did 45 independents and centrists the two main 
centerright parties adopted different tactics most members of 
the union for french democracy voted against the bill while most 
members of the rally for the republic abstained 
during a twoday debate on the bill legislators defeated an 
amendment that would have banned sales of tobacco products to 
minors under 16 and adopted an amendment prohibiting liquor sales 
at service stations 
according to the government smoking causes 65000 deaths and 
alcoholism 45000 deaths each year in france 
health minister claude evin the bills chief sponsor said 
todays measure is without precedent in the history of public 
health 
the bill is part of an antismoking campaign by the government 
cigarette prices are due to rise by 15 percent later this year and 
the national railroad announced this week that smoking is to be 
banned on all of its commuter trains

plans for political union of a dozen west 
european countries have moved ahead but its still unclear what 
the final product will look like 
leaders of the european community wrapped up a twoday summit on 
tuesday by agreeing to open a special conference on dec 14 to 
sketch in the details 
british prime minister margaret thatcher is confident she has 
scotched grandiose plans for some kind of federal europe 
i think we have won on that she told reporters 
irish prime minister charles haughey host of the summit said 
the leaders wanted to have a new closer much more integrated 
political relationship 
there will be he said a much closer growing together 
politically 
some have suggested the community should turn itself into a 
federal united states of europe 
others predict a more limited outcome 
they foresee closer cooperation in foreign policy areas so the 
community can play a more influential role on the world stage 
the european parliament the communitys legislature likely 
would be strengthened it would have more say over the european 
commission the trading blocs executive body 
mrs thatcher has opposed any moves that would transfer national 
sovereignty to new community agencies 
to sharpen the debate aides of the leaders have drawn up a list 
of questions that need to be answered before a political union can 
be formed 
the fivepage document said the overall goal is to strengthen 
the ability of the governments to act in the areas of their 
common interests 
the unity and coherence of its policies and actions should be 
ensured through strong and democratic institutions it said 
the paper asked whether new powers should be transferred to the 
community from individual governments it wondered how the notion 
of community citizenship should be dealt with and whether new 
agencies should be set up 
the paper was drawn up after the leaders committed themselves at 
an arpil summit also held in dublin to a political merger by late 
1992 
their decision was sparked by the political upheavals in eastern 
europe the west european nations contend they must offer stability 
at a time of uncertainty in eastern europe 
the special conference on political union will run parallel to a 
convention starting dec 13 on fashioning an economic and 
monetary union 
the conferences are needed to change the communitys founding 
treaty of rome and set up any new political or monetary agencies 
officials want both conferences to finish their work and the 
nations to ratify any treaty changes by late 1992 
that is the date when the nations already are set to create a 
europeanwide market to do that they intend to get rid of the 
many trade barriers that bar the free movement of money people and 
products 
at their summit the european community leaders also called on 
all south africans to renounce violence in a declaration that 
britain said was directed squarely at nelson mandelas african 
national congress 
but the leaders of the trade bloc refused to ease sanctions 
against south africas whiteled government saying they need 
further clear evidence that changes to end apartheid will 
continue 
mrs thatcher said it was a great pity that the ec nations 
were unable to agree publicly to make a start now on easing 
sanctions 
unanimous support by the ec nations is needed to end joint 
embargoes imposed in 1986 that banned imports of south african 
iron steel and gold coins 
the summit also considered a west german and french demand for 
15 billion in immediate aid to help the soviet unions 
deteriorating economy 
most of the other leaders opposed giving money to the soviet 
union with no clear idea of how it would be used 
the community ordered its executive commission to undertake with 
the world bank and other international agencies a study of moscows 
needs 
officials said they expected italy which takes over the 
communitys sixmonth rotating presidency on july 1 to have soviet 
aid proposals ready by fall

the loss of a military pistol 
pfc mark mcmonagle 20 of philadelphia faced up to life in 
prison and a dishonorable discharge at sentencing today by the 
military panel that convicted him after an hours deliberation 
tuesday 
they crucified him said mcmonagles mother patricia 
they sent him to panama to give up his life and they do this to 
him there wasnt enough evidence to support the charges 
sgt paul finsel jr 25 of arkoma okla also was charged 
with murder in the jan 25 shooting his courtmartial begins 
friday 
mcmonagle of the 7th light infantry division from fort ord 
admitted to an investigator that he went to a panama city bar and 
brothel with finsel who lost his handgun when the two went into a 
back room to evade military police 
finsel convinced him that they should fake a firefight and say 
the gun was lost in the melee mcmonagle told the investigator the 
two fired their rifles in the air and soldiers nearby heard the 
shots and took up the fake firefight 
leila diaz de panay 50 was shot in the abdomen while taking a 
bath in the courtyard of her home mcmonagle said he had seen a 
shadow and fired six times 
what they did was a terrible terrible thing its a hard 
thing to swallow the prosecutor capt robin johnson said in 
her closing argument 
defense attorney capt norman allen argued that finsel was 
belligerent frantic agitated and in trouble and that 
mcmonagle simply followed his lead 
if he made a mistake thats a tragic mistake we 
shouldnt offer up mcmonagle as a sacrifice mrs de panay wasnt 
the only civilian who died he said 
the defense also offered affidavits from panamanians in the 
neighborhood who said they heard gunfire coming from an apartment 
building 
a third soldier pfc marc gussen 19 of teaneck nj who 
accompanied mcmonagle and finsel testified for the prosecution

the prosecution had asked for a prison term of 6 years for 
hippenstielimhausen calling him a merchant of death he had 
faced a maximum sentence of eight years 
defense lawyers sought a briefer sentence noting that the 
defendant had confessed judge juergen henninger sentenced him to 
five years 
the ruling followed an 11day trial one of the most heavily 
publicized business trials in west german history 
hippenstielimhausen said in court on june 13 that he had 
suspicions the project would be in conflict with west germanys 
export laws but did not investigate because he didnt want to 
lose the business 
west german law forbids the export of technology or material 
that could be used in conflict areas such as the middle east 
libya has said the rabta plant was intended for producing 
pharmaceuticals but us and west german officials have said it 
was built to manufacture chemical weapons 
hippenstielimhausen testified that the rabta project began in 
1984 when a middleman contacted him about building a chemical 
plant to make pharmaceuticals and insecticides 
he said he found out later that the 136 million project was to 
be in libya and that his participation might violate west german 
law 
hippenstielimhausen also admitted not paying taxes on 117 
million on profits from his transactions 
allegations that several western companies helped build the 
rabta plant have triggered worldwide debate about toughening 
international export law enforcement 
hippenstielimhausen is the only person to be charged in the 
case though west german authorities are investigating 18 other 
people 
imhausenchemie was found to be the key supplier of equipment 
construction plans and technical expertise to develop the rabta 
project prosecutor hansheiko klein said hippenstielimhausen had 
delivered plans and documents as well as providing material valued 
at 12 million 
the defendant was arrested in may 1989 and kept in investigative 
custody since his time in custody counts toward his sentence 
on tuesday the ard television network said libya intended to 
build a second plant using the plans furnished by 
hippenstielimhausen for the first plant it cited us and west 
german intelligence sources for the information 
the television report said two west german companies and a 
netherlands firm were suspected of having ties to the project 
according to the report the stuttgart prosecutors office is 
investigating the allegations against the companies in west germany 
the libyan scandal first came to light in december 1988 when 
the united states charged that west german firms were providing 
massive assistance for construction of a chemical factory capable 
of producing poison gas 
west german government officials at first denied any of the 
countrys companies were involved but later acknowledged the 
allegations were true

communist party officials said today that the 
central committee will meet friday to consider postponing next 
weeks party congress a policysetting gathering of 4700 
delegates from across the country 
reformers fear that conservative foes of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs could dominate the gathering split the party and 
undermine the soviet leader as he tries to pull his country out of 
a deep economic and political crisis 
the congress scheduled months ago is to begin monday but 
reports suddenly surfaced this week that it might be put off 
because of concerns that hardliners may prevail 
the reformminded president of the russian republic boris n 
yeltsin told a news conference tuesday that he favored postponing 
the congress until autumn to stabilize the political situation 
a party official who spoke on condition of anonymity said today 
that partys 249member policymaking central committee would meet 
on friday 
yeltsin predicted there would be a real struggle at the 
central committee plenum over the congress timing 
a postponement could prevent party hardliners from capitalizing 
on their successes last week at a meeting of party members from the 
russian federation the largest soviet republic 
the 2700 party members at the russian federation meeting will 
constitute a majority of delegates to the national congress 
party congresses are normally held every five years delegates 
have the right to elect the party leadership and change the partys 
rules and program though in the past power has always flowed from 
the top 
until gorbachev came to power the party was the countrys 
leading political force now gorbachev has stripped it of its 
political monopoly as he seeks to transfer power to a more 
democratic government 
the communists have been blamed for the sorry state of the 
economy and have suffered major defeats at the polls 
gorbachev heads both the party as general secretary and the 
government as president a post whose powers he has expanded so he 
could lose the party post and still be soviet leader 
despite the uncertainty surrounding the congress the central 
committee went ahead today and published a program statement 
that the congress will discuss and be asked to approve 
the program spread across almost two pages of the communist 
party daily pravda takes a repentant tone about the partys blame 
for the countrys ills 
but it maintains that the countrys main problem lay in the past 
distortion of socialism not the ideology itself 
false ideas about socialism as a society based on the state 
monopoly on property and dictatorship led by the partystate brass 
in the name of the proletariat led to tyranny and lawlessness and 
the alienation of people from property and authority the 
committee said 
the program backs many of gorbachevs reforms already under way 
including the transition to a market economy and the partys 
rejection of its former political monopoly 
it also proposes more independence for party organizations in 
the 15 soviet republics and allows for the possibility of various 
platforms in the party without actually approving fullfledged 
factions 
on the issue of whether party units should be removed from the 
kgb and army the program says the party groups should be allowed 
to remain but be clearly separate from the basic power structure 
the russian federations parliament gave preliminary approval 
this month to a decree that would ban the party units in the kgb 
and army it also forbade officials to combine a high party and 
government post 
yeltsin said tuesday that the national party congress was the 
last chance for radical renewal of the party and that he would 
suspend his party membership if he is dissatisfied with the results 
the public debate over whether to postpone the congress 
contrasted sharply with carefully orchestrated meetings in the past 
along with the new program gorbachev is trying to bring new 
party rules to this congress according to an early draft they 
would slim down the central committee and expand the ruling 
politburo which has generally included about a dozen members and 
done all the partys most important decisionmaking 
it would also be renamed the presidium 
gorbachevs spokesman arkady a maslennikov asked tuesday by 
reporters about gorbachevs position on the congress timing 
declined to comment and said the central committee would decide 
when the congress would be held

the farm until he was 21 if his father would buy him a 400

prime minister margaret thatcher today urged an 
international conference to reduce the use of chemicals depleting 
the ozone layer and she pledged 9 million to the worlds first 
global environmental fund 
we need to speed up action and set ourselves higher targets 
and shorter deadlines for reducing and eventually eliminating cfcs 
and halons mrs thatcher told the government ministers and 
officials from nearly 100 countries 
even if all the chemicals which damage the ozone layer were 
banned tomorrow ozone depletion would continue to get worse for 
more than a decade it would still take our planet well beyond the 
lifetime of all of us here to replenish the ozone already lost 
that is the extent of the damage we have already done 
cfcs used in aerosol sprays refrigerators foams and cleaning 
solvents destroy ozone gas scattered through the stratosphere 
about 30 to 50 miles above the earths surface scientists say that 
without the gas that filters out harmful ultraviolet rays life in 
earth would cease 
higher ultraviolet radiation damages the human immune system 
causes skin cancer and cataracts harms crops and disrupts sea life 
dr mostafa tolba executive director of the un environment 
program told delegates far too much is at stake to contemplate 
failure we have no option but to succeed and inshallah god 
willing we will succeed 
tolba said the london meeting was establishing a new political 
movement to deal with the environmental crisis a movement rooted 
in respect for the value of human life the value of nature we are 
not just writing a new treaty we are writing a new chapter in 
international relations 
during the threeday meeting the officials will study proposals 
calling for a worldwide ban on a group of chemicals that threaten 
the planets ozone shield the conference also will discuss a 
proposal to create an international fund to help poorer countries 
pay the high price for ozonefriendly technology 
conference sources said diplomats were close to agreement on 
such a fund which the united states opposed until two weeks ago 
in a week of working sessions before the meeting moved to 
ministerial level delegates tried to hammer out details for the 
fund proposal 
but a number of tricky issues remain to be resolved by the 
ministers including where the funds will come from 
many developing countries insist that the richer industrialized 
nations help the third world pay the bill estimated at 2 to 7 
billion in the coming years for converting to substitutes for 
chloroflurocarbons or cfcs 
developed nations led by the united states want to shift their 
contributions from aid funds already allocated 
the ministers appear likely to agree on a threeyear down 
payment of 160 million as suggested by tolba 
another 80 million would be promised to china and india to 
coax them into signing the 1987 montreal protocol on protecting the 
ozone layer 
the ministers work if successful will extend and strengthen 
the montreal protocol already considered an environmental 
watershed 
in september 1987 56 nations agreed to halve cfc by 1996 
since then scientific evidence on the destruction caused by the 
chemicals has prompted countries to move more quickly to eliminate 
them completely eightyone nations decided in principle last year 
to ban them by the year 2000 
ministers will be debating whether to quicken the pace the 
12nation european community along with the nordic countries 
australia and new zealand wants to move up the ban to 1997 the 
united states and japan are opposed 
the ministers are likely to agree to ban halons and carbon 
tetrachloride in addition to cfcs by the year 2000 both are used 
in firefighting 
scientific studies overwhelmingly show the ozone layer will not 
be fully restored unless all the severely damaging chemicals are 
banned worldwide and some of the less harmful substitutes are 
strictly controlled

the american medical associations legislative 
body pledged to scrutinize the organizations finances because of 
questionable use by one former officer of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars 
the amas 436member house of delegates voted tuesday to require 
that members be told how much officials receive as pay and as other 
compensation 
the board understands full well that the extraordinary 
financial transactions and their consequences have resulted in pain 
and embarrassment said john j ring of mundelein ill 
chairman of the board of trustees 
for that for our lack of knowledge at a time when we should 
have known the board of trustees expresses its sincere regret to 
this house of delegates ring said 
the house rejected an effort to require reporting of all 
consulting contracts to ama members 
that proposal was submitted by the louisiana delegation which 
argued that the ama officials need such oversight if their members 
confidence is to be restored 
but the amas newly appointed executive vice president james s 
todd said publishing the details of consulting contracts would put 
the association at a competitive disadvantage in attracting talent 
at reasonable prices and inhibit the development of organization 
policies 
the board of trustes submitted a report to the delegates 
outlining findings that james h sammons the amas former 
executive vice president 
authorized the reimbursement from ama funds of 353826 for 
losses suffered by his money market account during the october 1987 
stock market crash without disclosing the transaction to the board 
approved a loan of 267710 for a condominium for the ama 
general counsel which ultimately the ama foreclosed on at a loss 
of 76672 
sold the ama his home for 280000 although the ama was in 
possession of a single appraisal indicating that the value of the 
property was from 265000 to 272000 
sammons retired in february

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge rose 08 percent in may another indication the economy will 
skirt a recession this year the government reported today 
the index of leading economic indicators is designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months in advance if the economy 
continues to grow through november it will reach its eighth year 
of expansion it already is the longest expansion in peacetime 
history 
but todays commerce department report also contained an ominous 
note the largest negative contributor among the 11 
forwardlooking indicators was an index measuring consumer 
confidence 
it was further evidence that americans are becoming more 
cautious in their spending which accounts for twothirds of the 
nations economic activity and which has helped fuel economic 
growth for 7 years 
but as consumer spending appears to pause analysts point to 
business investment and overseas demand for us goods as a major 
stimulus for continued although weak growth 
the leading indicators were released as white house and 
congressional leaders were preparing to resume negotiations on a 
plan to reduce the fiscal 1991 deficit a reduction that would 
require continued economic growth 
a recession would make that task much more difficult since it 
would mean a loss of jobs and incomes diminished corporate profits 
and a drop in tax revenues at the same time the government would 
be called upon to increase spending on various benefits 
in advance of todays report a consensus of economists had 
expected the index to have risen 07 percent 
seven of the components were positive in may a longer average 
workweek an increase in the price of raw materials a larger 
amount of orders for consumer goods higher stock prices a 
decrease in the weekly unemployment claims slower business 
delivery times and an increase in orders for new plants and 
equipment 
in addition to the drop in consumer confidence the other 
negatives were a decrease in the money supply a smaller number of 
building permits and a drop in manufacturers unfilled orders 
the various changes left the index at 1462 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and up 14 percent from its level a year ago 
many economists who believe the nations economy will continue 
to expand sluggishly during the remainder of the year are growing 
more anxious over the slowing contributions of american consumers 
the consumer confidence index was negative in january and 
february and unchanged in march it posted a slim gain in april 
analysts have cited a poor job market and weak wage gains for 
the flagging consumer confidence 
consumer spending will remain weak economists for merrill 
lynch capital markets wrote in their current weekly economic amp 
financial commentary 
spending on services should rise solidly in the second quarter 
after posting a meager gain in the first quarter but spending on 
goods will probably decline 
indeed retail sales have fallen for three straight months 
through may the first time that has happened since the summer of 
1981 during the last recession retail sales represent about half 
of consumer spending 
the commerce department also reported last week that overall 
consumer spending was flat in may and said the april and march 
gains were weaker than first thought 
and the federal reserve in a survey completed by its district 
banks earlier this month found very little growth if not a 
decline in real consumer spending for durable and nondurable 
goods this quarter from last 
many analysts say the feds tightmoney policy designed to curb 
inflation has contributed to the economic slowdown by boosting 
interest rates some are calling for further relaxation of the 
feds grip on credit before the economy slips into a recession 
a june survey of 51 prominent economists by blue chip economic 
indicators in sedona ariz produced a consensus forecast of a 
weak 19 percent growth in the gross national product the 
nations total output of goods and services the gnp rose 3 percent 
last year and 44 percent in 1988 
but while consumers may be pulling back recent reports indicate 
that the manufacturing sector may have bottomed out bigticket 
durable goods orders for instance were up 39 percent in may 
while industrial production posted a 06 percent increase 
nevertheless the automobile and housing industries continue to 
be a drag on the economy leaving exports one of the few bright 
spots 
because of weak domestic demand the merrill lynch 
economists said exports are likely to be the main source of 
growth in the second quarter and for the rest of the year 
meanwhile the commerce department also said the index of 
leading economic indicators had slipped a revised 01 percent in 
april after a 10 percent gain in march but even though the index 
fell in april the revision was a slight improvement over the 02 
percent decline originally reported last month

bloody military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
since then he has elevated supporters such as his brother yang 
baibing into key posts in the military and the government and has 
been regarded by china watchers as putting himself in line to 
succeed 85yearold deng xiaoping as chinas senior leader 
deng and yang are longtime allies and yang has supported dengs 
economic reforms but is thought to be more politically conservative

not happy with mandelas continuing refusal to renounce violence in 
the struggle against apartheid some in congress also criticized 
his support for radical leaders such as libyas moammar gadhafi and 
cubas fidel castro 
jackson in introducing mandela at the rally apologized for 
us complicity in his arrest by the south african government 27 
years ago 
our cia was a factor in your arrest jackson said we are 
ashamed of that he added as the crowd again erupted into 
applause and cheers 
earlier tuesday in an address to a joint meeting of congress 
mandela made an impassioned plea for justice comparing the 
struggle of south african blacks to that of americas founding 
fathers 
our people demand democracy our country which continues to 
bleed and suffocate needs democracy he said 
the onetime prisoner was accorded the kind of reception from 
congress normally reserved for us presidents his entrance was 
greeted with a 2minute ovation and there was even longer applause 
from the packed house chamber when he finished 
in an interview published in todays editions of the washington 
post mandela said the anc would agree to the lifting of us 
economic sanctions once mutual confidence is achieved between 
the pretoria government and the antiapartheid movement 
and it may not be necessary for us actually to agree upon a 
constitution before we can feel that fundamental and irreversible 
change has taken place he said 
its a question that must depend on the progress that were 
making and on how we address the problems that arise and how 
mutual confidence is built in the course of our negotiations

three days after legal aid lawyers won a court 
fight to restrict a bush administration drugfighting effort a 
presidential panel sought to bar antipoverty attorneys from taking 
such cases 
directors of the legal services corp asked congress in a 
resolution approved monday to enact legislation that would bar 
legal aid groups receiving federal money from representing 
suspected drug dealers in publichousing eviction cases 
the resolution approved by voice vote also urged local legal 
aid organizations to discourage their attorneys from filing such 
cases 
last friday legalaid lawyers in richmond va won a court 
order that restricted publichousing raids planned by the 
department of housing and urban development to evict suspected drug 
dealers by seizing their leases 
the order generally barred eviction of publichousing tenants 
suspected of dealing drugs unless they were given prior notice and 
a hearing 
instead federal marshals on monday began serving notices 
informing tenants that their publichousing leases were seized and 
they would eventually be kicked out the seizures are authorized by 
a forfeiture provision of the 1988 antidrug abuse act 
by late tuesday 25 publichousing leases had been seized in 
washington chicago richmond new york city macon ga new 
haven conn and columbus ohio the justice department said hud 
said it planned to serve seizure notices in 19 cities this week 
legal services corp spokesman david eisner said the resolution 
was not adopted as a specific response to the case brought in 
richmond by the central virginia legal aid society 
but eisner said legal services attorneys like those lawyers in 
the richmond case are standing in the way of the policy of getting 
drug dealers out of public housing 
board members have been concerned for some time that legal 
services attorneys take simple eviction proceedings and make them 
drag out for six months or a year eisner said 
at mondays board meeting henry mclaughlin the executive 
director of the central virginia legal aid society that obtained 
last weeks court order argued against adoption of the resolution 
mclaughlin told board members that seeking due process for 
publichousing tenants facing eviction was a proper use of federal 
money the richmond organization received 562652 from the legal 
services corp this fiscal year eisner said 
the resolution had the support of hud secretary jack kemp who 
announced plans for the antidrug raids last month 
kemps initiative to get the scourge of drugs out of public 
housing is one of the most important things that we can do 
eisner said 
carolyn stewart a spokeswoman for the national legal aid and 
defenders association said the board would prohibit innocent 
relatives of suspected drug dealers the right to challenge their 
evictions 
what this implies is guilt by association and trial by 
family she said if a family member is involved in any sort of 
drug activity this action by the board would punish all members of 
that family by denying them representation under the law 
civil libertarians argue that eviction without prior notice and 
a hearing violates the constitution

red crescent societies said iranian authorities want to move 
people out of the stricken northwestern provinces quickly to avoid

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini those stands include the february 1989 
death threat to british author salman rushdie for offending some 
moslems with his novel the satanic verses rushdie has pledged 
several thousand dollars to help survivors of the quake 
one deputy ayatollah saddegh khalkhali said quake aid from the 
united states iraq and saudi arabia was appreciated but iran 
could not forget our martyrs the highranking cleric added 
we cannot forgive the killing of 300 people on the airbus or the 
400 at mecca 
he was referring to the us downing in july 1989 of an iranian 
jetliner that killed all 290 aboard the navy said the jetliner 
shot down over the persian gulf was mistaken for a warplane 
more than 400 moslem pilgrims most of them iranians died when 
saudi troops opened fire on a demonstration in mecca in july 1987

hundreds of tamil youths in colombo today in sweeps for guerrillas 
believed to have infiltrated the capital 
the government meanwhile said 400000 people have fled the 
2weekold upsurge in sri lankas civil war and that many were 
without food water or shelter we are starving said one 
resident in the town of batticaloa there is no electricity and 
no transport only guns guns and guns 
also today military officials called on 2500 tamil tiger 
rebels believed trapped in an eastern jungle to surrender or risk 
an intensive air attack 
the tigers are on the retreat on all fronts they are a 
spent force now said army commander general hamilton wanasinghe 
on monday and tuesday government air force planes bombed and 
strafed rebel positions surrounding a strategic 200yearold fort 
in the northern city of jaffna the rebel stronghold 
a rebel statement claimed hundreds of buildings had been set 
on fire by incendiaries and that civilians were killed in the raids 
at least 1626 combatants have died since the civil war flared 
up anew on june 11 fighting started after a tamil man claimed he 
was manhandled by sinhalese police and tamil tiger guerrillas 
responded by attacking police stations in the east 
ethnic sinhalese make up 75 percent of the islands 16 million 
people and control the army and the government tamils comprise 18 
percent 
claiming discrimination by the sinhalese tamil tigers have 
since 1983 been waging war to carve out a separate tamil homeland 
in the north and east 
military officials say they believe tamil tiger guerrillas are 
moving into the south and planning attacks against sinhalese 
civilians as retribution for rebel losses in the north and east 
in the past rebel statements have said they kill sinhalese 
civilians because government troops kill tamil civilians 
police and troops today cordoned off kochchikade town about a 
half mile north of colombos city center and went into homes 
shops and businesses questioning young tamils

people from leaving or entering the town for more than six hours a

grenade attack on sinhalese buddhists worshiping at a shrine in 
anuradhapura an ancient capital about 100 miles north of colombo 
in all 157 people were kiled

japan has long been pressing washington to raise 
taxes to cut the us federal deficit and a senior tokyo official 
today said that may have helped get president bush to agree to the 
idea of tax increases 
misoji sakamoto chief cabinet secretary said japanese 
officials strongly supported us measures to cut the budget 
deficit in talks with us negotiators in tokyo this week 
the tokyo talks are aimed at reducing japans 49 billion trade 
surplus with the united states by making structural changes in both 
nations economies 
the talks went into an extra day today but remained at an 
impasse said a senior bush administration official participating 
in the negotiations the official who requested anonymity urged 
tokyo to match bush by making a stronger commitment to ending the 
trade imbalance between the two countries 
bush in a written statement released tuesday in washington did 
not say whether he was considering an actual tax increase or higher 
revenues from the current system 
but his willingness to include the word tax was the 
strongest indication to date that he might be willing to accept tax 
increases as part of an effort to lower the deficit 
an official from the prime ministers office quoted sakamoto as 
saying bush may have paid consideration to japanese opinion on 
increasing us taxes 
the us budget deficit is regarded as a spur to us 
consumption that increases demand for japanese imports and thus 
contributes to the trade imbalance 
on tuesday japanese officials at the talks asked us 
negotiators why the united states dropped a target year of 1993 for 
eliminating the deficit estimated at 200 billion in the fiscal 
year that begins oct 1 
us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said later 
tuesday they told the japanese that washington wants to look beyond 
eliminating the budget deficit by 1993 and to envision a budget 
surplus 
in addition to working on lowering the budget deficit the 
united states has agreed to improve worker training and education 
and to increase savings steps designed to increase exports and 
lower imports 
among other issues japan has agreed to increase public works 
spending ease restrictions on opening large retail stores revise 
landuse policies to curb high land prices and crack down on unfair 
business practices 
the measures are thought likely to increase foreign 
opportunities for trade and investment in japan

czechoslovakias first freely 
elected parliament in 44 years convened its opening session today 
and prepared to elect new leaders 
the legislature is dominated by president vaclav havels civic 
forum and its slovak ally which led last years peaceful revolution 
against the communists 
the house of nations and the house of the people the two 
chambers of parliament met to elect their respective chairmen and 
were then to convene in joint session to elect a new speaker and 
the presidium of parliament the presidium meets between 
legislative sessions to decide on technical matters 
alexander dubcek who was appointed to head the interim 
parliament in december after the communists were ousted was the 
only candidate for parliament speaker civic forum spokesman petr 
kucera said dubcek represents public against violence the civic 
forums sister movement 
his deputy was again to be zdenek jicinsky a civic forum 
member kucera said 
dubcek who led the 1968 prague spring reforms that were crushed 
by sovietled troops regained prominence in the heady days of the 
peaceful revolution as a symbol of reform 
th interim government was to submit its formal resignation later 
today but incumbent premier marian calfa is to head the new 
cabinet havel planned to formally announce the new federal 
government late today on national television 
several ministers appointed to calfas interim government of 
national understanding in december were expected to retain their 
posts 
the civic forum and public against violence won elections two 
weeks ago gaining 170 seats in the bicameral house the 
communists who ruled unchallenged for four decades until the 
november revolution won 47 seats 
the third strongest group is the christian democratic alliance 
which won 40 seats in the june 89 elections the first free 
balloting since 1946 
the composition of the new federal government was forged at 
turbulent coalition talks which ended friday after the christian 
democratic movement reversed an earlier decision and decided to 
join civic forum in governing 
the unofficial leader of the christian democratic movement jan 
carnogursky was appointed deputy prime minister in the slovak 
regional government today after rejecting any post on the federal 
government the slovak government is headed by public against 
violence member vladimir meciar 
the czech regional government to be put together by the civic 
forums petr pithart a former activist was not expected to be 
announced before friday 
the civic forum and public against violence could have formed a 
minority federal government but would have lacked the necessary 
threefifths majority needed to push key constitutional changes 
through parliament 
officials from both groups repeatedly said they sought the 
broadest possible coalition as czechoslovakia embarks on a 
difficult transition to a market economy they refused to include 
the communists in the government

sticking to the fast track toward 
unification west germany has drawn up a plan to complete its 
merger with the east in december but east germans are already 
feeling the pinch of economic union 
five days before the two countries create one economy east 
germans are being forced to search for food and other necessities 
theres no soap here no meat said ines kroll a 
25yearold mother of two as she pushed her shopping cart past 
depleted shelves in the only store in blankenburg a small town 
north of berlin 
merchants are shutting stores and clearing shelves to make room 
for the expected deluge of western goods groceries have been 
canceling their orders with east german suppliers and letting their 
stocks run out 
experts say many east german companies are keeping their 
products off the market until next week when they can sell them 
for west german marks 
some merchants say they also want to avoid taking in large 
amounts of east german marks in the days before the nearly 
worthless currency is replaced by the valuable west german mark 
in munich a huge west german electronics and household 
appliance company siemens today announced it will invest 600 
million in east germany and hire up to 30000 people in the next 
several years 
the announcement represents the biggest single investment 
program since east germany shed its communist government and began 
moving to a free market 
the east german government on tuesday announced temporary import 
tariffs to protect industries threatened by the switch to 
capitalism after 40 years of socialist central planning 
amid criticism that the rapid merger was hurting many east 
germans west german finance minister theo waigel said that quick 
unification was important because of the unstable situation in the 
soviet union 
we need to go through the door to unification because it can 
close shut again he told reporters 
germans fear instability in eastern europe if soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev should be removed from power in the squeeze 
between hardliners upset with his reforms and progressives who 
think he is moving too slowly 
about 380000 soviet troops are still on east german soil and 
moscow has balked at withdrawing them over objections to natos 
desire that a united germany be party of the western military 
alliance 
suggestions for what a political treaty unifying east and west 
would look like were released tuesday by the west german interior 
ministry in the form of a discussion paper 
under the proposals east germany would officially join west 
germany the day after elections for a joint german parliament 
west and east german politicians have proposed dec 9 or dec 16 
as possible dates for the balloting 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said in bonn 
west germany on tuesday that he expected the east german cabinet to 
decide today to begin negotiations on the political treaty he said 
a pact should be ready for debate in both parliaments by early 
september 
last week the parliaments of both states ratified the treaty 
outlining the monetary economic and social union that is to take 
effect on sunday 
on that day the west german mark officially replaces the east 
german mark and 40 years of rigid socialist economic policy give 
way to freemarket rules 
lines of up to 1000 people have been snaking down sidewalks in 
east berlin as people converge on banks to fill out paperwork 
necessary for converting savings accounts to west german marks 
depending on age accounts up to 6000 marks 3600 can be 
converted at the most favorable rate of one west german mark for 
each east german mark 
in an attempt to protect its ailing industries from the first 
rush of western competition east germany on tuesday announced a 
series of tariffs on western goods beginning sunday 
an 11 percent tariff is to be imposed through the end of the 
year replaced the following quarter by a 6 percent tariff 
food will not be affected although east germanys huge farm 
collectives are expected to be battered by western agricultural 
producers 
it was uncertain whether the tariffs would remain if the current 
quick pace of unification continues and the nations fully unify in 
december 
many stores are already stocking west german goods under 
agreements made in march that allowed a limited entry of some 
products into the country 
but many staples still were in short supply mrs kroll said she 
could find no detergent and rejected the skimpy selection of meat 
she also had mixed feelings about the end of the east german mark 
my husband mints east german coins for a living she said 
some experts say 1 million to 4 million workers will lose their 
jobs in the first two years of economic unification 
many of the heavy industries that were once the backbone of the 
former centrally planned economy are expected to fail as they face 
leaner more efficient western concerns

nelson mandelas scheduled arrival in miami tonight 
has driven another wedge between blacks and cubanamericans in this 
racially divided city 
the south african antiapartheid leader has been greeted as a 
hero in new york boston and washington dc but south florida 
politicians have refused to honor him and area cubanamericans are 
calling for mass protests during his address thursdayvention in miami beach 
black leaders in turn are calling for counterdemonstrations 
and have condemned t at a labor 
conhe politicians for ignoring the message of hope 
mandela could bring to us blacks 
to reject mandela is to reject us and that is very deep its 
psychologically devastating said johnnie mcmillian head of the 
miamidade chapter of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people 
mandelas visit was welcomed until last week when he defended 
cuban leader fidel castro palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafat and libyan leader moammar gadhafi for their help in 
the early years of the african national congress struggle against 
south africas racial separation laws 
the heavily cuban city of miami immediately withdrew a planned 
proclamation in mandelas honor 
miami ms of rioting 
in los angeles county supervisors also clashed over mandelas 
support for castro arafat and gadhafi but they still declared 
friday to be nelson mandela day 
supervisor mike antonovich argued against honoring mandela who 
is scheduled to arrive in los angeles on friday on the last leg of 
his us speaking tour he called for mandela to renounce his 
support for arafat gadhafi and fidel castro 
because arafat and gadhafi have been responsible for so much 
bloodshed in the middle east and all three have contributed to 
terrorism i think we should ask that mandela repudiate his support 
for them antonovich said tuesday 
but supervisor kenneth hahn said mandela had made it clear he 
supported arafat castro and gadhafi because of their opposition to 
the south african governments policy of apartheid or racial 
segregation

the courts could be the next stop for the 
issue of equality in funding for oklahoma schools now that voters 
have defeated a sharethewealth referendum at a special election 
voters split sharply by region as they defeated the proposal 
tuesday 
the plan was clobbered in oklahoma city the largest 
municipality and in most rural areas especially in western 
oklahoma where oil reserves and utility plants are concentrated 
but it won by a hefty margin in tulsa in northeastern oklahoma 
the states second largest city 
andrew tevington gov henry bellmons chief of staff said he 
understood one group was planning a federal lawsuit challenging the 
disparity in district funding which ranges from 10600 to 2300 
in per pupil spending 
unfortunately well probably end up in federal court and the 
federal courts will write our funding laws instead of the people of 
oklahoma tevington said 
similiar lawsuits have been successful in such states as 
kentucky and texas 
bellmon blamed voter confusion for the defeat of the proposal 
and three less controversial issues the proposals had the support 
of bellmon a republican and leaders of the democratic majority in 
the legislature 
the other three questions would have changed how state school 
land money is handled removed antiquated language from the state 
constitution on school attendance and changed the membership of the 
state school board 
the sharethewealth plan would have redistributed on a 
statewide basis oil and property tax revenue that now goes to local 
schools 
it would have put into a single pot property taxes collected on 
utility railroad and airline property valued at more than 
500000 locally assessed real and personal commercialindustrial 
property valued in excess of 500000 gross production revenue on 
oil the rural electric cooperative corporation tax and motor 
vehicle registration taxes and fees now apportioned to schools

investigators questioned two armoredcar 
guards and gave them liedetector tests after gunmen knocked off 
their truck for 108 million the biggest such heist in us 
history officials said 
the armored car was robbed by at least two men with a shotgun 
tuesday after its crew stopped at a convenience store for a coffee 
break investigators said 
the guards were forced to drive to a wooded area a halfmile 
away where they were tied up blindfolded and gagged officials 
said the robbers put the cash in bags weighing at least 1500 
pounds into another vehicle and drove off 
neither guard was injured no suspects have been identified 
said sheriffs capt neil flood 
there are a lot of questions obviously about the manner of 
the heist sheriff andrew p meloni said it appeared to be 
wellplanned 
the sheriff would not say whether the robbery of the armored 
motor service of america truck could have been an inside job 
the two guards who worked for the company a total of 18 months 
were questioned all day and into the evening by fbi and sheriffs 
officials said flood 
the guards whose names were not released are not really 
suspects the sheriff said they obviously need to be talked 
to he said 
amsa controller george clark said the guards agree to submit to 
liedetector tests as a condition of employment 
to prevent inside jobs work crews are rotated clark said it 
was unclear how long tuesdays crew had worked together 
the truck had left the companys offices in the rochester suburb 
of chili for the federal reserve bank branch in buffalo 
during the stop at a store a gunman shoved the barrel of a 
shotgun into an opening in the trucks cab and seized the vehicle 
from the driver officials said the other guard was taken hostage 
when she returned from the store 
the guards freed themselves within 15 minutes of the robbery 
drove to amsa and reported the holdup meloni said 
guards carry 38caliber revolvers 
clark said the coffeeandsandwiches stop was not against 
company rules but it is strongly discouraged from a security 
standpoint he said its hard to knock off a moving truck 
officials are reviewing the companys records and looking for 
witnesses who might have seen the armored car meloni said 
the robbery is at least the secondlargest theft in us history 
and the largest involving an armored car in 1982 about 11 
million was reported taken from the sentry armored car courier co 
office in new york city but authorities said much of the money may 
have been previously embezzled 
in 1985 79 million was stolen from a wells fargo depot in new 
york by masked gunmen in 1983 robbers took gold estimated to be 
worth up to 11 million from a smelting company and jewelry 
wholesaler in north miami fla 
the robbery tuesday was the second multimilliondollar robbery 
of an amsa truck in 13 months in 1989 two men drove a oneton 
armored truck through a garage door in east syracuse 
pistolwhipped two guards and stole 29 million 
two suspects are on trial in federal court in syracuse one of 
the guards pleaded guilty last year to taking part in the robbery

the supreme court today limited the power of 
environmentalists to use the federal courts to prevent opening of 
federal lands to commercial development 
by a 54 vote the justices overturned a proenvironmentalist 
ruling that had been challenged by the bush administration 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said the national 
wildlife federation failed to provide enough or the right kind of 
evidence to justify its suit against the interior department 
the federation challenged the departments plans to change the 
status of some 180 million acres of public land in the west and 
alaska more than a fourth of all public lands in the nation 
the federation said it was suing to protect federal lands 
against unwise or premature disposition and development 
including millions of acres to be opened up to mining and mineral 
leasing 
the decision to reclassify the land for development and other 
uses was made by the reagan administration in 1985 following a 
policy instituted by thensecretary james g watt in 1981 
the wildlife federation said the reagan administration violated 
federal law by opening the land to development without following 
procedures in the 1976 federal land policy and management act 
flpma 
the us circuit court of appeals here said the federation and 
its 45 million members have legal standing to sue based on 
affidavits by members that they use some of the land for recreation 
for example federation member peggy k peterson said she uses 
land in the south passgreen mountain area of wyoming 
scalia today agreed with the bush administration that the 
federation may not base a wholesale challenge to the interior 
departments reclassification on allegations such a change will 
adversely affect a few people 
challenges must be mounted case by case scalia said unless 
congress changes the law to permit a broader attack or federal 
officials bow to such broader demands by environmentalists 
the casebycase approach is understandably frustrating to 
an organization which has as its objective acrosstheboard 
protection of our nations wildlife and the streams and forests 
that support it he said 
but scalia said it is not up to the courts to come up with 
farreaching solutions when not authorized by law 
until confided to us more sweeping actions are for the other 
branches of government he said 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy 
dissenting were justices harry a blackmun william j brennan 
thurgood marshall and john paul stevens 
blackmun in an opinion for all four said the wildlife 
federation presented enough evidence in affidavits by two members 
to warrant a full trial of its suit 
he said todays ruling characterized the federal land management 
program as 1250 or so individual classification decisions but 
blackmun said the majority offers no argument in support of this 
conclusory assertion and i am far from certain that the 
characterization is an accurate one 
the case is lujan vs national wildlife federation 89640

a rape victim is suing the fort worth 
startelegram for publishing an account of the attack that she says 
contained identifying details even though it did not give her name 
the woman says the story violated her right to privacy as a 
victim of sexual assault she is seeking at least 8000 in damages 
for alleged emotional and physical distress 
the startelegram did not publish the womans name or address in 
reports about the sept 24 rape 
the lawsuit contends the story included information about the 
rape and about her including her age occupation and the make of 
her car that made her identity readily apparent to people in 
her community 
as a result of the story the woman has suffered extreme and 
severe embarrassment humiliation and acute depression the 
lawsuit alleges 
the lawsuit seeks 3000 in damages to pay for psychological 
treatment and 5000 in past and future lost wages 
the us supreme court last year gave the news media added 
protection in reporting such crimes the court ruled that the 
weekly florida star did not have to pay damages to a rape victim 
whose name it published 
the ruling limited states power to punish the reporting of 
truthful information that is lawfully obtained florida law makes 
it a crime to publish the names of victims of sexual assault the 
florida star said the rape victims name was published 
inadvertently after it was released by a sheriffs department 
texas law does not prohibit publishing rape victims names nor 
does it prohibit law enforcement agencies from releasing the names 
said startelegram associate executive editor phil record 
we were just surprised at this kind of suit because we dont 
see that it has a great deal of merit in it record said tuesday

people charged with child abuse are not always 
entitled to a facetoface confrontation with their young accusers 
the supreme court ruled today 
in a decision expected to make it easier to prosecute suspected 
child abusers the court said the constitution allows for 
exceptions to such potentially traumatic confrontations 
the decisions were announced as the court ended its 198990 
term which included major rulings on abortion the right to die 
flag burning political patronage police efforts to stop drunken 
drivers and prayer groups in public schools 
in a major victory for affirmative action the court today 
upheld federal policies that favor minorities in awarding broadcast 
licenses 
by a 54 vote the justices said the federal communications 
commission policies do not discriminate unlawfully 
the childabuse decision will let states use some techniques to 
protect minors particularly those called to testify against their 
accused abusers from a facetoface courtroom confrontation 
more than half the states have enacted such measures already 
by a 54 vote the justices upheld the childmolesting 
conviction of a maryland daycare center owner even though four 
young children were allowed to testify out of her presence the 
children testified over oneway closedcircuit television 
but by a separate 54 vote the court refused to reinstate an 
idaho womans childabuse conviction thrown out by the states 
highest court because the child did not testify rather a 
pediatrician testified at the trial about his interview with the 
2yearold alleged victim 
writing for the court in the maryland case justice sandra day 
oconnor said where necessary to protect a child witness from 
trauma that would be caused by testifying in the physical presence 
of the defendant at least where such trauma would impair the 
childs ability to communicate the constitutions confrontation 
clause does not prohibit use of a procedure other than a 
facetoface confrontation 
she was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun and anthony m kennedy 
justices antonin scalia william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and john paul stevens dissented 
writing for the dissenters scalia said seldom has this court 
failed so conspicuously to sustain a categorical guarantee of the 
constitution against the tide of prevailing current opinion 
the constitutions sixth amendment in part says in all 
criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be 
confronted with the witnesses against him 
though we reaffirm the importance of facetoface 
confrontation with witnesses appearing at trial we cannot say that 
such confrontation is an indispensable element of the sixth 
amendments guarantee of the right to confront ones accusers 
the majority said 
states in recent years increasingly have sought to protect young 
witnesses particularly those testifying in childabuse cases 
the number of such cases is growing more than 22 million 
childabuse reports were filed in 1988 according to the national 
committee for the prevention of child abuse 
testimony by children on closedcircuit tv on videotape 
through oneway mirrors or behind screens has been allowed in some 
criminal cases 
todays decision in the maryland case allows those techniques 
as long as they ensure the reliability of the evidence by 
subjecting it to rigorous adversarial testing 
in other action today the court 
limited the power of environmentalists to use the federal 
courts to prevent opening of federal lands to commercial 
development 
by a 54 vote the justices overturned a proenvironmentalist 
ruling that had been challenged by the bush administration 
upheld arizonas death penalty law in a decision that also 
removes a constitutional shadow from similar laws in idaho and 
montana 
the justices by a 54 vote ruled that the arizona law is valid 
even though judges not juries decide whether a murder was a crime 
for which death can be the punishment 
ruled that most of the nations post offices may ban all 
soliciting on their property 
the justices by a 54 vote said a regulation imposing such a 
blanket ban does not violate freespeech rights 
in a significant ruling on the protections offered by the 
constitutions first amendment the court reinstated the 
convictions of two political activists who solicited contributions 
and distributed literature from the sidewalk outside a post office 
in bowie md 
the justices in 1988 struck down an iowa mans sexualassault 
conviction because two 13yearold girls were allowed to testify 
while shielded from his view by a large screen placed in the 
courtroom between them and the defendant they cited a sixth 
amendment violation 
but the 1988 ruling appeared to leave unanswered whether there 
may be exceptions to the facetoface requirement 
the maryland court of appeals threw out sandra craigs 
conviction saying her 7yearold accuser and three other young 
witnesses wrongly were allowed to testify over closedcircuit tv 
they testified from a room outside the courtroom with only a 
prosecutor and one of mrs craigs lawyers present mrs craig and 
her other lawyer remained in the courtroom where they could watch 
the testimony and talk privately by telephone to the other lawyer 
the state court ruled that mrs craig was entitled to a new 
trial on charges she sexually molested a girl who attended her 
clarksville md daycare center 
she had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for her 1987 
conviction on those charges 
today the nations highest court said the maryland court was 
wrong 
mrs craig also faces charges stemming from the alleged 
molestation of 12 other children who attended the daycare center 
in the idaho case laura lee wright of boise was convicted of 
lewd conduct committed on her daughters who were then 5 and 2 she 
was sentenced to 20 years in prison before the state supreme court 
threw out her conviction 
the state court said the trial judge wrongly allowed a 
pediatrician who had examined the younger girl to testify about 
what she told him the girl did not testify and therefore could 
not be crossexamined by mrs wrights lawyer 
the state court said the pediatricians testimony lacked 
particularized guarantees of trustworthiness because it was not 
taperecorded because he asked leading questions and had a 
preconceived idea of what facts the child should be disclosing 
oconnor joined by the four dissenters in the maryland case 
upheld the state court ruling while not agreeing with how that 
ruling was reached 
given the presumption of inadmissibility accorded accusatory 
hearsay statements we agree with the court below that the state 
has failed to show that the younger daughters incriminating 
statements to the pediatrician possessed sufficient particularized 
guarantees of trustworthiness under the confrontation clause to 
overcome that presumption oconnor said 
the cases are maryland vs craig 89478 and idaho vs wright

nelson mandela who refuses to renounce violence 
for the cause of racial equality arrived in the birthplace of 
americas apostle of nonviolence today to lay a wreath at the 
grave of martin luther king jr 
mandela emerged smiling and waving from his chartered jet at 
hartsfield atlanta international airport he was greeted by a 
marching band and about 200 invited guests including gov joe 
frank harris mayor maynard jackson and coretta scott king widow 
of the slain civil rights leader 
about 100 people lined an access road nearby hoping for a 
glimpse of mandela who came from washington security was heavy 
mandela quickly reminded atlantas civil rights leaders some of 
whom have gently criticized him for not renouncing violence that 
he sees south africas black movement as different from the us 
civil rights struggle 
unlike you we are still under the grip of white supremacy 
he said in a brief address at the airport 
mandela then spoke briefly to reporters saying nonviolence 
is a good policy when conditions permit 
mandela was scheduled to lay a wreath at kings tomb and then to 
address an audience of civil rights activists at big bethel ame 
church a later address at morehouse college was canceled but 
mandela still planned to address a soldout rally at grant field 
mandelas schedule has been trimmed down to give the 71yearold 
leader more rest he has been touring the united states since june 
20 
the rev joseph lowery president of the kingfounded southern 
christian leadership conference hoped mandelas visit would 
inspire black americans to see that we can overcome 
we think we have problems hes overcome and i hope he lights 
our fire lowery said 
in turn some civil rights figures hoped a firsthand look at 
racial progress in the south would lead mandela to try to avoid 
violence in his homeland 
others including kings widow said more attention is paid to 
mandelas stance on violence than to the south african governments 
violence toward blacks 
as chairman of the mandela visit host committee mrs king said 
she hoped to show the african national congress leader atlantas 
impressive spirit of interracial cooperation 
civil rights leaders who worked with king during the 1960s 
acknowledged that kings staunch policy of nonviolence conflicts 
with mandelas stand but they are sympathetic to the black 
nationalist leader 
in general they say it is more important to free south african 
blacks than to insist on doing it their way 
rep john lewis dga a civil rights veteran who has been 
jailed 40 times said without violence we were able to turn the 
south into a new south maybe being there will give him the will to 
try as much as possible to avert violence 
if our experiences in desegregation can be helpful we will 
offer them lowery said 
there are some differences in every revolution but i have to 
advocate nonviolence ive seen the results said the rev hosea 
williams kings field lieutenant during the 1960s 
i would tell mr mandela to please study and evaluate the 
teachings of martin luther king jr before deciding that violence 
is the only way to bring about needed social change

negotiators at eastwest talks on 
reducing conventional forces in europe agreed today to limit the 
number of tanks and armored combat vehicles each alliance may have 
diplomats said 
agreement on the two weapons categories will speed negotiations 
for an initial agreement at the talks by the end of this year they 
said 
this is a very major step a western diplomat told the 
associated press on condition of anonymity this is the heart of 
the treaty along with artillery these are the chief components of 
ground offensive forces limiting this is one of the major steps in 
which these negotiations will increase stability in europe it is 
certainly one of the key elements 
the breakthrough proposal on tanks and armored combat vehicles 
came from the french and the poles 
the frenchpolish proposal which was adopted by the delegates 
establishes an overall ceiling for armored combat vehicles of 
30000 on each side and a ceiling of 20000 tanks for each side 
it also sets a minimum weight limit of 165 tons for tanks 
regardless of whether they have tracks or wheels one of the more 
contentious issues at the talks has been finding common definitions 
for tanks and other armaments 
the agreement also no longer makes a distinction between armored 
troop carriers and other armored vehicles thus removing a further 
obstacle 
nato and warsaw pact delegates referred to the proposal as a 
package noting the link between definitions and limits on 
numbers and weights 
they said the future treaty text will include a long list of the 
arms they would carry thus classifying all the weapons the two 
sides currently have 
polish chief delegate wlodzimierz konarski told reporters 
earlier this month that this would be unprecedented in eastwest 
relations and that these lists would become the basis for the 
reductions 
according to us estimates the west has 23600 tanks against 
warsaw pacts estimated 52500 nato has about 34025 armored 
combat vehicles and the warsaw pact 59400 according to us 
estimates last year 
the talks on conventional forces in europe are designed to 
reduce troops and nonnuclear weapons of the two alliances from the 
atlantic ocean to the ural mountains the 16 nato and seven warsaw 
pact countries are participating 
both sides hope to have an agreement ready for signing by 
december when leaders from 35 nations including the 23 involved 
in the talks meet in paris 
the other 12 participants are neutral and nonaligned countries 
in europe that would also be affected by reducing tensions on the 
continent 
eastern and western diplomats said there were still many 
outstanding issues to be resolved before a final agreement can be 
signed 
they said the issues of ceilings and definitions of aircraft and 
helicopters as well as terms for verification still remained to be 
settled 
the superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195000 troops each 
in central europe with the united states permitted to maintain up 
to 30000 troops elsewhere in europe 
nato has proposed a maximum of 4700 combat aircraft for each 
side with an additional 500 air defense interceptors but the east 
wants a higher ceiling

a delegation of lithuanian leaders including the 
baltic republics president and prime minister left for moscow 
today for likely meetings with top soviet officials a spokesman 
said 
the parliament of the breakaway republic is scheduled on 
thursday to begin debating a possible suspension of its march 11 
declaration of independence that has put it at loggerheads with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
darius suziedelis of the lithuanian parliaments information 
bureau said in a telephone interview that president vytautas 
landsbergis and prime minister kazimere prunskiene were leading a 
sixmember delegation to the soviet capital 
the delegation also included deputy prime minister romualdas 
ozolas and legislative leader egidius bickauskas 
suziedelis said little was known about their agenda in moscow 
but it was unlikely that the group would travel to the soviet 
capital without an understanding that a meeting would be held with 
top soviet officials 
landsbergis met with gorbachev on tuesday morning and then 
returned to vilnius the lithuanian capital 
he told the supreme council parliament upon his return that he 
received a better understanding of what kind of a compromise might 
be acceptable to gorbachev and that he might return for more talks 
with the soviet leader 
mrs prunskiene asking parliament on tuesday to freeze the 
declaration of independence told the republics lawmakers that 
early independence is impossible without a compromise with the 
kremlin 
she said gorbachev agreed in a telephone call tuesday after 
meeting with landsbergis that he would end a crippling economic 
embargo and begin negotiations that will discuss a different 
status for lithuania including as an independent state 
but the only official statement from moscow was much more 
toughly worded 
the soviet news agency tass quoting what it said was an 
official report on the meeting with landsbergis said the 
lithuanian president was told talks can only be held if lithuania 
declares a moratorium and suspends the act of march 11 for a period 
of talks they can be held only in the context of an 
interrepublican dialogue on the preparation of a new union treaty 
and the formation of a union of sovereign socialists states

adnan khashoggis lawyer said today the 
governments case against his client was built on contrived 
allegations against the saudi financier 
the lawyer james linn said no evidence exists that khashoggi 
ever plotted with former philippine president ferdinand marcos and 
imelda marcos to circumvent a us court injunction freezing their 
assets in 1986 
where is the proof where is the evidence of them forming a 
criminal agreement linn demanded in a closing statement before 
the jury in us district court 
the case is expected to go to the jury on thursday following a 
government rebuttal 
prosecutors possibly with political ambitions envisioned a 
case of the century when they first brought the indictment in 
1988 against former president marcos mrs marcos khashoggi and 
several others linn said 
after marcos died last september he said you got a widow 
you got a saudi businessman it takes a lot out of the case 
but he said the government chose to proceed with the thought 
lets see if we can convict this man because of his yachts and 
airplanes or mrs marcos because of her shoes and her shopping 
he asked jurors to consider whether khashoggi famous for his 
business acumen would agree to illegally take over ownership of 
four new york buildings secretly owned by the marcoses 
multimilliondollar buildings that were losing a million dollars 
a month 
a day earlier mrs marcos attorney urged jurors to acquit the 
former philippine first lady of all charges against her saying 
that even one verdict of guilty would be a stink and a smear on 
her as though it were fifty 
in a dramatic fourhour summation that brought mrs marcos to 
tears at the end lawyer gerry spence ridiculed the governments 
fraud and racketeering case as a fantasy spun by questionable 
witnesses and unsupported by convincing evidence 
the only thing that matters is the facts and the facts in 
this case demand that you free mrs marcos that she not stand here 
and undergo this torture for another day said spence 
she committed no crime except of loving a man for 35 years 
raising his children taking his lavish gifts and being his ardent 
supporter 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of helping her late husband embezzle 
222 million from their countrys treasury to buy four new york 
buildings jewelry and art works 
she faces up to 50 years in prison and 1 million in fines if 
convicted of racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and 
obstruction of justice 
khashoggi 54 is charged with mail fraud and obstructing 
justice for allegedly helping the marcoses hide their ownership of 
the properties after a us court order froze their assets if 
convicted he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and a 
500000 fine 
wearing her customary black dress of mourning for her husband 
who died last september mrs marcos sat with downcast eyes through 
most of spences oration occasionally smiling or fighting back 
tears 
at the end she tearfully embraced the silverhaired lawyer and 
kissed him on both cheeks

wind erosion eased its grip on the great 
plains this season because of improved moisture conditions in much 
of the region according to a final survey by the agriculture 
department 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said tuesday that an estimated 78 million acres were 
damaged by wind in the 10 states that make up the great plains 
down 45 percent from 143 million acres in 198889 
the agency measures wind damage during a sevenmonth season that 
runs from nov 1 through may 31 when winds are usually the 
strongest and soils the driest the survey covers 541 counties in 
the 10 states 
most of this decrease is the result of precipitation in 
colorado and kansas where land damaged from wind decreased from 
65 million acres last year to 463000 acres this year for the two 
states scaling said 
the greatest damage was in north dakota in its third year of 
severe drought he said the state reported 29 million acres 
damaged this season compared with 23 million last year and a 
record 35 million acres in 198788 
north dakota accounted for more than onethird of the total wind 
erosion in the 10state region 
kansas after setting a record with 51 million acres damaged 
last year largely because of a oneday storm that damaged nearly 
48 million acres reported only 190000 acres damaged this season 
the least damage was in nebraska with 130000 acres damaged 
compared with 192000 last year 
officials said the record for land damaged by wind in the great 
plains was 153 million acres in 195455 the year that the agency 
began annual records

barrys arrest testified that she and the mayor used cocaine at 
her mothers home and a dozen other locations from 1986 to 1988 
the drug use continued after her intimate relationship with 
barry ended she testified at the mayors cocaine and perjury 
trial she said she ended the affair because i was losing 
myself 
barry sat 50 feet away in the courtroom while moore offered her 
account barrys wife effi sat nearby in a front row seat 
asked how frequently she and barry used drugs she responded 
over 100 times there were times we did it more than once a day 
sometimes two to three times 
there was so much drug use over that period of time and i was 
losing myself losing my character regarding my children 
moore testified i wanted to get my life in order 
moore helped the government in the fbi sting operation which 
resulted in the mayors arrest jan 18 at the vista hotel it was 
during their meeting in a hotel room that the fbi videotaped the 
mayor allegedly smoking crack cocaine 
it was moore who persuaded barry to come to the hotel room the 
videotape of their meeting is expected to be played following her 
testimony 
moore began testifying after assistant us attorney judith 
retchin told the jury the mayors drug dealings with the mayor 
included powder cocaine crack marijuana and opium retchins 
statement is the first time that opium use by the mayor has been 
suggested 
prosecutors have said moore and barry carried on a torrid 
relationship for three years barrys wife effi sat in the front 
row of the courtroom as moore took the stand 
prosecutors said they want to ask moore about drugs other than 
cocaine even though barry is charged with crimes only in 
connection with alleged cocaine possession 
retchin explained that because barry plans to raise the defense 
that he was entrapped by overzealous government investigators 
moore should be permitted to testify about the other substances to 
show he was predisposed to drug use 
barry lawyer r kenneth mundy said marijuana use does not 
suggest predisposition or propensity for crack cocaine 
on tuesday tape recordings of barrys grand jury appearances in 
january 1989 were played in court 
barry told the grand jury he had no indication that a friend 
charles lewis was involved with drugs and that he and lewis had 
not given drugs to each other those assertions form the basis of 
the three felony perjury charges against the threeterm mayor 
lewis a convicted drug dealer testified last week that he and 
barry used crack cocaine powdered cocaine and marijuana repeatedly 
from 1986 through december 1988 barrys grand jury appearance came 
the following month 
there was nothing unusual or criminal about his visits to 
lewis washington hotel room in december 1988 barry said in his 
sworn testimony 
he told the grand jury in january 1989 that he gave lewis money 
for food on occasion but not more than 60 in total lewis 
testified that barry gave him hundreds of dollars for drugs even 
sending some money over to lewis hotel with one of the mayors 
security guards 
barry recalled that his first visit to lewis hotel room was on 
dec 17 1988 lewis testified last week that the two smoked crack 
cocaine the night of dec 16 1988 
lewis testified last week that he left his hotel room to buy 
crack when drug supplies got low on dec 19 1988 while barry 
stayed in the room barry told the grand jury he didnt recall 
lewis leaving the room 
barry said he spent an hour or less in the room on the night of 
dec 19 lewis testified the mayor was there well past midnight and 
long after a televised monday night football game had ended 
the mayor told the grand jury that he and a city government 
attorney james mcwilliams discussed mcwilliams job problems 
during the game 
mcwilliams testified last week that he tried repeatedly to do 
just that but that he wasnt successful and at one point found 
barry slumped over on a bathroom seat an arms length from drug 
paraphernalia

here are excerpts from the supreme courts 
decision wednesday holding that people charged with child abuse are 
not always entitled to a facetoface confrontation with their 
accusers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we have never held however that the confrontation clause 
guarantees criminal defendants the absolute right to a facetoface 
meeting with witnesses against them at trial 
in sum our precedents establish that th confrontation clause 
reflects a preference for facetoface confrontation at trial 
a preference that must occasionally give way to 
considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case 
that the facetoface confrontation requirement is not absolute 
does not of course mean that it may easily be dispensed with our 
precedents confirm that a defendants right to confront accusatory 
witnesses may be satisfied absent a physical facetoface 
confrontation at trial only where denial of such confrontation is 
necessary to further an important public policy and only where the 
reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured 
we likewise conclude today that a states interest in the 
physical and psychological wellbeing of child abuse victims may be 
sufficiently important to outweigh at least in some cases a 
defendants right to face his or her accusers in court that a 
significant majority of states has enacted statutes to protect 
child witnesses from the trauma of giving testimony in child abuse 
cases attests to the widespread belief in the importance of such a 
public policy 
thirtyseven states for example permit the use of videotaped 
testimony of sexually abused children 24 states have authorized 
the use of oneway circuit television testimony in child abuse 
cases and eight states authorize the use of a twoway system in 
which the childwitness is permitted to see the courtroom and the 
defendant on a video monitor and in which the jury and judge is 
permitted to view the child during testimony 
given the states traditional and transcendent interest in 
protecting the welfare of children and buttressed by the growing 
body of academic literature documenting the psychological trauma 
suffered by child abuse victims who must testify in court we will 
not secondguess the considered judgment of the maryland 
legislature regarding the importance of its interest in protecting 
child abuse victims from the emotional trauma of testifying 
accordingly we hold that if the state makes an adequate 
showing of necessity the state interest in protecting child 
witnesses from the trauma of testifying in a child abuse case is 
sufficiently important to justify the use of a special procedure 
that permits a child witness in such cases to testify at trial 
against a defendant in the absence of facetoface confrontation 
with the defendant 
the requisite finding of necessity must of course be a case 
specific one the trial court must hear evidence and determine 
whether use of the oneway closed circuit television procedure is 
necessary to protect the welfare of the particular child witness 
who seeks to testify 
to be sure facetoface confrontation may be said to cause 
trauma for the very purpose of eliciting truth but we think that 
the use of marylands special procedure where necessary to further 
the important state interest in preventing trauma to child 
witnesses in child abuse cases adequately ensures the accuracy of 
the testimony and preserves the adversary nature of the trial 
indeed where facetoface confrontation causes significant 
emotional distress in a child witness there is evidence that such 
confrontation would in fact disserve the confrontation clauses 
truthseeking goal 
in sum we conclude that where necessary to protect a child 
witness from trauma that would be caused by testifying in the 
physical presence of the defendant at least where such trauma 
would impair the childs ability to communicate the confrontation 
clause does not prohibit use of a procedure that despite the 
absence of facetoface confrontation ensures the reliability of 
the evidence by subjecting it to rigorous adversarial testing and 
thereby preserves the essence of effective confrontation

seldom has this court failed so conspicuously to sustain a 
categorical guarantee of the constitution against the tide of 
prevailing current opinion the purpose of enshrining this 
protection in the constitution was to assure that none of the many 
policy interests from time to time pursued by statutory law could 
overcome a defendants right to face his or her accusers in court 
this debate is not an appropriate one i have no need to defend 
the value of confrontation because the court has no authority to 
question it it is not within our charge to speculate that where 
facetoface confrontation causes significant emotional distress in 
a child witness confrontation might in fact disserve the 
confrontation clauses truthseeking goal 
if so that is a defect in the constitution which should be 
amended by the procedures provided for such an eventuality but 
cannot be corrected by judicial pronouncement that it is archaic 
contrary to widespread belief and thus null and void for good 
or bad the sixth amendment requires confrontation and we are not 
at liberty to ignore it 
the court today has applied interestbalancing analysis 
where the text of the constitution simply does not permit it we 
are not free to conduct a costbenefit analysis of clear and 
explicit constitutional guarantees and then to adjust their 
meaning to comport with our findings

canada as a country is an unnatural union 
less a nation than a grouping of regional entities with vastly 
differing interests and outlooks it always has been difficult to 
govern following the failure of the meech lake constitutional 
accord it may become even harder 
its not a natural state either economically or 
geographically and certainly not culturally constitutional 
expert john d whyte said 
and the one cultural linkage that we did have living under a 
british crown has absolutely disappeared said whyte dean of 
the queens university law school 
is canada impossible to govern 
were about to find out said joseph jockel a specialist in 
canadian studies at st lawrence university in canton ny 
beyond the shortterm squabblings and constitutional theory 
there is a combat between two visions of what canada is and they 
may be incompatible 
the majority of quebecois see canada as binational a pact 
between two nations and two people in which one is quebec and one 
the people of canada jockel said meech was to have addressed 
that 
most english canadians see canada as a country of 10 provinces 
and of one people to which some special characteristics in quebec 
have to be accommodated 
meech really crashed on the rocks of those two visions he 
said 
meech lake was an attempt to gain frenchspeaking quebecs 
signature on canadas 1982 constitution the agreement contained 
five points covering the provinces most important concerns 
including one clause designating quebec a distinct society 
within canada 
the clause had little practical impact but was a symbol of 
enormous importance to the 65 million quebecois who make up about 
25 percent of canadas 26 million people 
other provisions involved a new constitutional amending formula 
some powers over immigration a limit on federal spending authority 
and a voice in appointing supreme court justices 
the measure required ratification by the federal government and 
the legislatures of all 10 provinces it died when newfoundland 
premier clyde wells decided not to put it to a vote and when a 
member of the manitoba assembly managed to delay debate beyond 
saturdays deadline 
the failure of the measure angered and embittered many 
quebecois who view it as a rejection by english canada the long 
debate over the amendment and the numerous reservations by other 
provinces gave rise to increased nationalism in the province 
the geography and history of canada make it difficult to find 
national consensus and in the case of constitutional amendments 
such as meech lake unanimity regional interests are nearly 
impossible to overcome 
british columbia in the far west has much more in common with 
the northwest united states than it does with ontario or quebec 
economically its gaze is as much oriented toward the orient as it 
is eastward to the rest of canada 
in the east the impoverished maritime provinces of 
newfoundland nova scotia prince edward island and new brunswick 
depend to a large extent on fish and on government handouts for 
economic survival 
newfoundland only joined the canadian federation in 1949 and 
many newfoundlanders still talk about going up to canada 
alberta in the west with its rich resources in oil and gas 
feels its political clout is not equivalent to its economic might 
that is one reason it fights so hard for reform of the moribund 
canadian senate 
the prairie provinces of saskatchewan and manitoba have always 
been seen as an agricultural vastness and market for central 
canadas products 
quebec with its historical linguistic and cultural 
differences is clearly distinct from the rest of canada it long 
has felt more comfortable in its close relations with the 
northeastern united states and more recently with ontario than 
with the rest of canada 
just look at the quebec license plates from boston to 
florida one quebec official said noting the french province was 
wholeheartedly behind the uscanadian free trade agreement of a 
year ago 
a common feeling is resentment of central canada and opposition 
to ottawa 
because 62 percent of canadas people live in ontario and 
quebec and because nearly 30 percent of all the people in the 
country live either in toronto montreal or vancouver political 
power has been unbalanced 
and while meech lake frequently was portrayed as french vs 
english canada which it was to some extent it was far more 
complicated 
special treatment for quebec was psychologically unacceptable 
for many english canadians and politically unacceptable for others 
now canada is really going to be tested jockel said we 
can count on quebec putting forth a new agenda even more explicity 
based on the notion of canada as two people

rabbi wolfe kelman whose leadership in 
conservative judaism helped pave the way for the ordination of 
women has died at age 66 
kelman died tuesday of cancer at the new york university medical 
center according to a colleague rabbi julra harlow 
known as a rabbis rabbi kelman never led a congregation 
but was a major force in the conservative movement as the 
executive vice president of the rabbinical assembly he was mentor 
to hundreds of rabbis guiding them spiritually and pragmatically 
during the 1960s he was among jewish leaders who participated 
in civil rights marches with the rev martin luther king jr in the 
south

family as a young boy his father rabbi zvi yehuda kelman died 
when wolfe kelman was 13 left with six children his mother

as rabbis kelman said years later women were first ordained in 
conservative judaism in 1985 
the standing of rabbis improved markedly over his years at the 
rabbinical assembly but he refused to take credit for being any 
more than someone who eased the way for others 
survivors include his wife the former jacqueline levy a son 
and two daughters

photographs taken from the 15 billion hubble 
space telescope have not been as good as expected the national 
aeronautics and space administration says 
the problem might be caused by all the lights in the telescopes 
mirror not focusing at the same point nasa officials said they 
scheduled a news conference later today 
the telescope was launched into orbit april 25 aboard the space 
shuttle discovery 
it is designed to study the far reaches of the universe while 
free from the distorting effects of earths atmosphere 
in assessing the hubble space telescopes optical performance 
the orbital verification team conducted a series of focus tests 
nasa said 
the anticipated image quality was not achieved it said 
computer models of the images indicate the source of this lesser 
quality image may be what is called spherical aberration a 
spherical aberration occurs when all the lights in a mirror do not 
focus precisely at the same point 
nasa managers are assessing the cause and determining what the 
scientific implications are the agency said

dallas times herald on sexist medical research 
its appalling that the researchers who conduct federally funded 
health studies routinely exclude women from the focus groups but 
thats exactly whats happening congressional investigators say 
incredibly knowing full well that the disease to be studied 
affects men and women researchers sometimes have been given 
funding by the national institutes of health for studies that use 
only men 
what makes the situation even more reprehensible is that the nih 
has had a policy in effect since 1986 that requires women to be 
included in studies unless their presence clearly is scientifically 
inappropriate an nih advisory committee reported in 1987 that less 
than 14 percent of the institutes budget was devoted to female 
health issues according to rep pat schroeder dcolo a leader 
of the congressional caucus for women 
we agree with mrs schroeder who said what these dismal 
findings reveal simply is that its ok to put womens health at 
risk 
the good news is that the nih essentially agrees with mrs 
schroeder william raub the acting nih director said he and his 
colleagues know that they must correct the situation immediately 
the caucus and the general accounting office the investigative 
branch of congress must make certain raub is held accountable

the arizona daily star tucson on libel ruling 
the supreme court clarified libel case law when it ruled in 
favor of a plaintiff who alleges a newspaper columnist defamed him 
15 years ago 
the columnist asserted by way of his opinion that a high school 
wrestling coach and a school superintendent had lied at a hearing 
courts in ohio found in favor of the columnist arguing that 
opinion is absolutely protected by the first amendment 
the decision written by chief justice william rehnquist 
removes opinion from this lofty perch rehnquist said that the 
courts had misconstrued previous libel decisions by the supreme 
court 
in a 1974 case gertz vs welch the court said that under the 
first amendment there was no such thing as a false idea 
rehnquist noted that the notion of idea soon became synonomous 
with opinion 
the court including dissenting justices william brennan and 
thurgood marshall said that there is a distinction between ideas 
and opinions moreover an opinion by implying a fact can defame 
justice brennans dissenting opinion disagrees only in the 
application of the courts principle he argued that the newspaper 
columnist did not say anything defamatory that the column was 
clearly conjecture and not based on fact 
the director of the reporters committee for freedom of the press 
said the decision ironically is going to encourage irresponsible 
commentary at the expense of wellreasoned analysis even in the 
worstcase scenario this is a dubious assertion the first 
amendment has not disappeared the court merely removed an 
artificial distinction

american business would gain better access to a market of almost 
100 million mexicans mexico a strategically important neighbor of 
the united states would gain needed jobs and prosperity without a 
penny in additional aid from washington those are the principal 
benefits that could materialize from a proposed free trade pact 
between the united states and mexico 
in a recent meeting in washington president bush and carlos 
salinas de gortari president of mexico committed themselves in 
principle to easing barriers to the flow of capital goods and 
services between the two neighbors 
since jobs are being exported away why not steer them towards 
mexico where a significant percentage of the new wages would be 
spent on american goods and services and more prosperity in mexico 
might actually ease the already high levels of migration of mexican 
workers to the united states 
mr bush and mr salinas are realistic about the obstacles 
ahead but the idea is worth pursuing

riots against increases in food prices and 
zambias oneparty government spread from lusaka to smaller cities 
today and troops herded protesters in one town into a sports 
stadium and held them at gunpoint 
hospital officials said five people died today raising the toll 
to at least 20 in the worst rioting in zambias history health 
officials conceded there could have been many more fatalities in 
barricaded suburbs and shanties without transport or telephones 
on the third day of protests and looting the government 
extended 6 pm6 am curfew to 24 hours 
civilian vigilantes patrolled the streets carrying automatic 
rifles military helicopters flew low overhead and suburban 
storekeepers fired volleys of bullets to defend their wares 
wounding an unknown number of looters 
police officials said widespread looting took place throughout 
the day at the town of kafue 25 miles south of lusaka 
army units later herded scores of looters into a kafue sports 
stadium and held them there at gunpoint the officials said on 
condition of anonymity 
rioting also reportedly broke out late tuesday in the 
mineralrich copperbelt province of this southcentral african 
nation where the government has more than doubled the price of 
corn meal as part of subsidycutting reform 
protesters also demand an end to socialist oneparty rule by 
president kenneth kaunda in the country of 75 million people it 
is the most serious challenge to kuandas rule since he came to 
power in 1964 
police said they had detained more than 550 people 
unconfirmed reports said 12 police officers were illed today 
when a rampaging mob attacked chainama police station east of the 
city center 
the attack if confirmed would bring the death toll since 
monday to 32 doctors in lusaka today said at least 20 people died 
and 190 were wounded in three days of riots 
by noon mobs or police had thrown up makeshift road blocks 
using burned out cars or broken masonry in most suburbs troop 
reinforcements in armored personnel carriers positioned themselves 
at strategic points but did not fire 
the windows of most stores in the downtown shopping district 
have been smashed in one witness said 
police spokesman andrew kaitisha said the arrests in lusaka were 
aimed at finding ringleaders among the thousands of protesters 
who rampaged through most districts of the capital looting stores 
burning flags and chanting antigovernment slogans 
they were arrested for screening and are being interviewed by 
a special police team for find out who the agitators are he said 
there were no immediate details of the extent of unrest on the 
copperbelt but reports said demonstrators clashed with security 
forces at the mining town of kitwe about 225 miles north of lusaka 
the violence was sparked by the june 19 increase in the price of 
corn meal the countrys staple from 279 per 55pound bag to 
656 
the increase was announced as part of an economic reform program 
aimed at reducing government subsidies and making the economy of 
one of africas poorest nations more commercially viable 
it had been recommended by financial agencies and donor nations 
the unrest took on a further political dimension as 
demonstrators mostly from lusakas most impoverished townships and 
shanties demanded kaundas ouster and an end to nearly two decades 
of socialiststyle oneparty rule 
earlier this year kaunda promised to hold a referendum on the 
future of zambias oneparty system but no date has been set for 
the vote 
residents of the lusaka suburb of chilenji said rioters smashed 
their way into a home occupied by kaunda a former school teacher 
and lay preacher before he led his nation to independence from 
british colonial rule in 1964 
the house seen in the past as a symbol of zambias black 
nationalist struggle against the british was extensively damaged 
residents said 
student rioters have also burned the flag of kaundas ruling 
united national independence party 
kaunda 67 has made no official comment on the unrest

the martinsburg wva evening journal on suspension of plo 
talks 
how drearily familiar is the criticism being made of president 
bushs decision to suspend friendly talks with the terrorist 
palestine liberation organization 
eighteen months ago us officials announced they would engage 
in a dialogue with the plo to help bring peace to the middle 
east the agreement was conditioned on plo renunciation of violence 
since then plo operatives under orders of highranking plo 
officials have conducted several terrorist raids one a few weeks 
ago was aimed at a us embassy in israel it was prevented only by 
quickacting israeli police and troops 
bush finally tired of plo duplicity last week called a halt to 
the farce he said hes suspending talks with the plo until he has 
some evidence itll keep its end of the bargain 
almost immediately there was criticism opponents of bushs 
stance said he may have opened the door to more violence in the 
middle east 
its time to stop worrying about upsetting the plo its time 
to demand as bush is doing that plo leaders keep their word about 
renouncing violence or face increasing enmity from the united 
states and a stepup in aid to israel 
certainly the rabid dog has been angered hell probably bite 
to try to force us to give in to him but his growls should be met 
by a kick in the teeth not a pat on the head

pasadena calif starnews on iran earthquake 
wouldnt it be going against our judeochristian cultural values 
in the west to be any less saddened or helpful because of 
yesterdays devastating earthquake in iran than we were after the 
devastating earthquake in armenia 
yes theres no question but that it would 
one doesnt have to flip through ones bible long before running 
into this admonition from matthew love your enemies bless them 
that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them 
which despitefully use you and persecute you 
they curse us they hate us they use us they persecute us 
they take our embassy and its people captive and ruin hundreds 
of lives 
they control the fates of dozens of innocent hostages in lebanon 
they put out a death sentence on an obscure angloindian writer 
in a model case study of radical intolerance 
they persecute their own people through a supposedly theocratic 
peoples dictatorship that ironically reminds us in its cruelty of 
nothing so much as the arrogant fake monarchy it toppled 
why shed crocodile tears for them 
because both soulsearching and logic will tell us theres no 
them there that is in the great scheme of things there are 
not enough bad guys in tehran to shake a stick at whereas the 
bereaved peasants in northern iran today no more invented the image 
of our country as the great satan than they invented 
highdefinition tv 
it may not work in the sneaky selfserving sense thats 
admittedly part of this notion if we send humanitarian aid it may 
not be admitted by the remnants of the ayatollah khomeinis kooky 
regime it may be considered a trick or merely propagandistic 
but then again subtly and diplomatically done such aid has a 
chance of working to both of our ends helping out people in 
distress and showing them that americans have love in their hearts 
for the iranian people if not for their leaders 
selfserving partially but remember that our government did 
install the shah no swell fellow himself this could be honest 
judeochristian penance and cynicism aside blessing them that 
curse us isnt such a bad path to follow simply for its own sake

the providence ri journalbulletin on the constitutionality 
of roadside checkpoints 
the fourth amendment protects us from unreasonable searches 
and seizures but what about roadside checkpoints which stop 
passing motorists in an effort to identify and apprehend the small 
minority who are driving under the influence of alcohol are these 
reasonable police procedures or do they violate the constitution 
this past week the supreme court ruled 63 that such 
checkpoints are ligitimate this was a sensible ruling it finally 
clears up a longdisputed legal issue and also provides one more 
weapon in the arsenal of those charged with limiting the highway 
mayhem caused by drunk drivers 
writing for the majority chief justice william rehnquist argued 
that roadside checkpoints meet a threepronged test of 
constitutionality 
first the problem being targeted is unquestionably important 
 
second checkpoints constitute an effective mechanism for 
identifying potentially dangerous drunk drivers 
third checkpoints cause only minor interference with peoples 
liberty

the daily telegraph london on aid to the soviet union 
it does not make sense to pour large sums of western 
taxpayers money into the bottomless pit of the soviet union that 
would not merely be a premature reward for inadequate economic 
reform it might actually slow the process 
it is natural for the west germans flush with the worlds 
largest trade surplus to wish to use this to political effect 
other western politicians too may wish they could buy mr 
gorbachev out of economic failure unfortunately this is not an 
attainable objective there are forms of assistance to which all 
should agree the bush administration has shown itself 
encouragingly ready to foster trade and must now persuade congress 
to agree subsidized american grain sales are not so different from 
the kind of food aid urged by some europeans a little may be 
politically useful but largescale subsidy would merely stunt the 
soviet economys feeble efforts to generate domestic production 
financial aid which merely reduced the soviet unions need to sell 
gold would be an incentive not a cure for domestic mismanagement 
investment which is what the soviet union most needs will come 
once a market economy exists

il messaggero rome on romania 
the recent repression and bloodshed in bucharest reveal a new 
kind of postcommunist regime in eastern europe incorrectly it is 
being called neocommunism it is in fact something quite 
different 
neocommunism is the courageous attempt of a mikhail gorbachev 
who in the face of an incredibly difficult transition phase is 
poised to move the crisisbound soviet union from stalinism to true 
democratic socialism even if for now it is but a vision the 
possibility cannot be excluded that from so many failings a new 
liberal communism can be born 
the course of iliescu in romania is quite different here there 
is no transition only restoration remember the words of elena 
ceausescu to her executioners you are all my children 
that ominous warning broadcast on televisions around the world 
weighs heavily on the heart another leopard reigns in the blood of 
bucharest

weltwoche zurich switzerland on soviet withdrawal of troops 
from germany 
suppose the soviet union pulls its troops out of germany not 
much imagination is needed to predict that on the day the last 
soviet soldier has left east germany the call will rise in west 
germany for the withdrawal of the western troops already now 
france and britain do not dare to voice any reservations and will 
not be able to resist such demands but the withdrawal of all 
foreign troops from germany would mean the factual end of nato 
whether it is dissolved or not germany because of its sheer size 
thus would get a special status in europe one does not need to 
accuse the west german politicians of seeking such status but they 
or their successors swept to power by the new nationalism and the 
new sense of greatness will be inevitably pushed in this 
direction the german special status will that be of a europoean 
superpower and not that of a medium power restricted and limited by 
an international treaty

mainichi daily news tokyo on the mideast situation 
the middle east situation is like a mirage from time to time 
the hope for lasting peace there appears but all too soon fades 
away at present the situation is going through a disappointing 
period 
anticipation for peace was strong toward the end of 1988 that 
was when the palestine liberation organization proclaimed the 
establishment of an independent palestine state but at the same 
time gave virtual recognition to the existence of israel and 
announced the abandonment of terrorism this led to the start of 
direct dialogue between the us government and the plo 
with the plos adoption of a realistic course and the us 
governments restudy of its policy toward that group many thought 
that the bottleneck in the long search for peace had at last been 
removed eighteen months have passed since then however instead 
of the prospect for peace becoming brighter several events 
darkening that prospect have taken place 
the killing of palestinian workers in the outskirts of tel aviv 
on may 20 by a mentally disturbed man led to protests and a 
general strike by palestinians 
then on may 30 armed groups believed to be members of a radical 
plo wing landed from speedboats at two bathing beaches near tel 
aviv the raid was checked by israeli troops but the question 
remains as to whether this was a violation of the plos pledge to 
abandon terrorism 
if the us government considers this to be a violation there 
is the possibility that the dialogue with the plo will be halted or 
interrupted temporarily this would deliver a big blow to the peace 
efforts 
at a time when there is little prospect for improvement of the 
situation all those concerned should endeavor not to make the 
situation worse efforts should be made to mitigate mutual 
distrust even the slightest careless action will increase that 
distrust

le monde paris on the political repercussions of the iranian 
earthquake 
this catastrophe could strengthen the arguments of president 
rafsanjani and other iranian leaders who want to end as rapidly as 
possible the isolation which has forced the country to turn toward 
moderate arab countries and the west 
it remains to be seen if the door which has opened a crack under 
these particularly sorrowful circumstances will close again when 
the emotions provoked by the earthquake have faded the 
politicalreligious rhetoric today relegated to secondary 
importance might surface again in the face of the complex problems 
which must still be resolved in order to knock down the wall of 
defiance and mistrust which 10 years of pure rigid khomeiniism 
has built around the islamic republic

more plays and lower ticket prices are the goals 
of a major new initiative to bring audiences back to broadway 
the plan to stimulate the production of plays in designated 
littleused broadway theaters as well as to reduce ticket prices 
was announced tuesday by members of the broadway theater community 
the project called the broadway alliance was born after months 
of discussion among theater owners producers unions and guilds 
said harvey sabinson head of the league of american theaters and 
producers 
it involves salary royalty and manpower reductions and 
concessions by actors producers theater owners unions and 
suppliers an equality of sacrifice said alan eisenberg 
executive secretary of actors equity association and committee 
chairman of the alliance 
because of these concessions production costs for the plays 
must not exceed 400000 and producers must use certain 
underutilized broadway theaters that capitalization is less than 
half of the usual 800000 to 1 million now required to produce a 
play on broadway 
in return ticket prices will be held to a top price of 24 for 
orchestra seats and 19 and 10 for mezzanine and balcony tickets 
the top ticket price for plays on broadway now ranges from 3750 
for the piano lesson to 50 for cat on a hot tin roof and 
the grapes of wrath 
the plan is aimed at oneset plays with small casts and does not 
apply to musicals 
the broadway community can no longer stand by as many of 
americas finest plays are being produced everywhere but on 
broadway said peter stone head of the dramatists guild most 
of these plays in the face of growing costs and lacking a big 
star a major prize or a lavish production have been relegated to 
regional and offbroadway theaters 
such acclaimed works as driving miss daisy steel 
magnolias frankie and johnny in the clair de lune other 
peoples money and the cocktail hour have achieved national 
recognition and large motion picture contracts while broadway can 
only watch and remember a time no more than 10 years ago when 
every one of these fine plays would have been lighting up broadway 
houses stone said 
broadways three major theater owners the shubert nederlander 
and jujamcyn organizations each have provided theaters for the 
new project the houses include the walter kerr the nederlander 
and either the belasco or lyceum theaters only the kerr is 
currently booked the theaters would be booked on a rotating basis 
the plan will go into effect sept 1 and run for 18 months 
until the end of february 1991 when it will be up for review 
producers wishing to participate would have to apply to the 
alliance for approval 
all personnel working at reduced wages including the actors 
will participate in a profitsharing plan after production costs 
are recouped the productions also will pay no rent to the theaters 
until costs are recouped

would lose the respect of our contributors and most importanly 
our readers the journals editor dr george lundberg said

a west german businessman was 
sentenced to five years in prison on wednesday for helping libya 
build a plant the court said was clearly intended to produce 
chemical weapons 
juergen hippenstielimhausen described by prosecutors as a 
merchant of death was found guilty by a state court in 
mannheim of violating west german export laws he was also found 
guilty on charges of tax evasion of 117 million that charge was 
based on his failure to report profits from the plant project 
chief judge juergen henniger said that based on expert witness 
testimony the court concluded the plant in rabta 60 miles south 
of libyas capital of tripoli was clearly intended for the 
production of chemical warfare agents 
he said the plant was capable of producing mustard gas and other 
poison gases and that hippenstielimhausen was aware of its 
purpose before he signed a contract in 1984 to build it for libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi 
libya maintains the plant was intended to make pharmaceuticals 
and insecticides not chemical weapons 
us officials told west german authorities in late 1988 and 
again in early 1989 that the plant was built to manufacture poison 
gas and an investigation against hippenstielimhausen and others 
was opened last year 
hippenstielimhausen 49 confessed on june 13 at his trial to 
helping design build and supply the facility but he did not say 
that he knew the plant was for poison gas he apologized for 
causing diplomatic problems for west germany 
the case was a major embarrassment for the west german 
government which initially denied west german firms were involved 
in the project 
as the verdict was read the pale hippenstielimhausen often sat 
with his head in his hands 
henninger sentenced hippenstielimhausen to the maximum three 
years for violation of export laws and four years for tax evasion 
then reduced it to a total of five years 
he said he cut the sentence because the defendant had shown 
remorse and confessed to his part in building the plant and to the 
tax evasion charges 
he will eligible for parole after serving twothirds of his 
sentence 
hippenstielimhausens lawyer eberhard wahle said he was 
considering an appeal 
the ruling followed an 11day hearing and marked one of the most 
sensational business trials in west german history 
hippenstielimhausen was the director of the imhausenchemie 
company of lahr in west germanys southern black forest region 
he testified that the rabta project got its initial start in 
1984 when a middleman contacted him about building a plant to 
make pharmaceuticals and insecticides he said he did not learn 
until later that the plant would be built in libya 
he said that as head of imhausenchemie he participated in 
construction of the rabta factory by delivering plans and 
equipment for the project although he suspected he was violating 
laws barring exports to areas of conflict such as the middle east 
hippenstielimhausen said he went on with the project because he 
didnt want to lose the business 
the responsibility and overall management were in my hands 
he told the court 
west german authorities are investigating 18 other people in 
connection with the rabta plant but none has been charged 
the rabta plant was damaged by fire under mysterious 
circumstances earlier this year and there have been widespread 
reports another plant in libya is under construction 
on tuesday the ard television network citing us and west 
german intelligence sources said libya intended to build a second 
plant using the plans furnished by hippenstielimhausen for the 
rabta project 
libya on wednesday denied a new chemical weapons plant is being 
built 
however the stuttgart prosecutors office on wednesday said it 
was investigating an export company in stuttgart in connection with 
the alleged second plant along with a computer and electronics 
company in the city of ulm

with her legs crossed leaning toward the camera but looking away 
and have appeared in newspapers on billboards and posters in buses 
and trains throughout the region 
bidding for the slip started at 500 and quickly grew after 
auctioneer diddi lynn worsole informed potential buyers that the 
slip was not in the room because turner was wearing it just a few 
blocks away 
shes sweating in it right now worsole said maybe there 
will be a little perfume on it

island real estate broker henry setaro came in with the top bid of 
1200 
its the closest i will ever get to kathleen turner setaro 
said i hope they dont wash it before i get it 
setaro whose wife sat next to him during the bidding said he 
might hang the slip up in his home but he first wants to see how 
his wife looks in it 
i think my wife will look as good in it as kathleen turner 
setaro said 
sandy setaro said she approved of the purchase because the money 
was for a good cause 
the slip is actually one of two that were custommade for turner 
to wear in the tennessee williams play in accordance with a union 
regulation that says producers must provide two sets of each 
costume

after the shrunken fiver comes the dimesized 
fivepence coin and as usual when confronted with change some 
britons are reacting with annoyance and suspicion 
the tiny coin hit the streets wednesday exactly three weeks 
after a smaller fivepound note was introduced to cries of derision 
are you kidding these are ridiculous said parry vaughn 
when he was shown the new shiny coins on a london street 
theyre too small theyre too fiddly and as bad as the 
fivepound note 
its horrible its too small said valdo cesar but his 
friend louis leffa disagreed it looks better its lighter and 
easier he said 
theyre small all right like the old sixpence but i would 
get used to them said roger brown referring to the coinage of 
predecimalization days 
it doesnt surprise me that most people dont like it this 
government has a habit of doing things people dont like said 
roger levy 
at the royal mint spokesman joseph cussen sounded mildly 
exasperated at the hostility that has greeted the new fivepence 
the british are resistant to any change and when it comes to 
coins they cant bear with them being interfered with or changed 
cussen said 
nobody asked us complained the tabloid sun to which the 
royal mint responded with results of a 1987 survey in which most 
people said they favored smaller lighter coins 
on the new fivepound note queen elizabeth ii has been updated 
to show her age 64 
but she is unchanged on the new coin the bust of her majesty 
still turns up heads and tails reveals the thistle badge of 
scotland 
the government says the new coins contain less metal saving 
about 170 million a year at 1 ounce each they are nearly 50 
percent lighter than their predecessors 
the 5 billion larger fivepence coins still in circulation will 
be phased out by dec 31 and recycled into new coins 
the british dont like a new coin at first but they get used 
to it and then they protect it fiercely cussen said 
he said the royal mint has never registered a flop like the 
united states susan b anthony dollar coin 
the closest shave he said was the coin that replaced the 
10shilling note in 1960 
the shilling note was a little brown note which really made 
you feel like you were spending money and people were genuinely 
heartbroken when it was phased out he said there was a move 
in parliament to have the coin withdrawn but it wasnt 
successful 
since then the pound has also become a coin

environmentalists charge that the bush 
administrations plans to balance the interests of northwest 
loggers against survival of the northern spotted owl are an assault 
on the endangered species act 
the administration tuesday announced preliminary plans for 
saving the owl by restricting logging 
at the same time the administration asked for relaxation of the 
1973 endangered species act to let policymakers weigh the economic 
and social costs against the benefits of saving animals that are 
listed as threatened 
they list the owl but now theyre going to change the law so 
they dont have to protect it larry tuttle oregon director of 
the wilderness society said tuesday 
andy kerr conservation director of the oregon natural resources 
council said the proposals amounted to a tiananmen square for 
american wildlife 
opening up the endangered species act is not a good idea in 
the heat of the moment he said 
meanwhile timber industry supporters were skeptical the 
government could make good on promises that enough timber would be 
sold to keep loggers employed and lumber and plywood mills rolling 
these proposals are a sham theyre smoke and mirrors said 
rep bob smith rore 
the us fish and wildlife service said friday the spotted owl 
of which 3000 to 5000 pairs remain would be designated a 
threatened species on july 23 
under law that obligates the government to protect the owl 
which nests in the oldest and tallest trees of the northwest 
timber prized by loggers 
the preliminary plans to protect the owl were announced by 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and interior secretary manuel 
lujan a task force headed by yeutter is to come up by sept 1 with 
a detailed plan 
the preliminary plan will reduce timber cutting on us bureau 
of land management land in oregon and northern california from 950 
million board feet annually to about 750 million lujan said 1000 
jobs would be lost over the next two year and 450 owls saved 
an earlier proposal by government scientists would have 
resulted in the loss of nearly 28000 jobs on blm and forest 
service land over the next 10 years lujan said that by careful 
cutting his proposal would protect 125 more pairs of owls than 
would the scientists proposal for blm land 
yeutter and lujan also called on congress to broaden provisions 
of the endangered species act so that an exemption committee will 
have more latitude to consider the economic and social impact of 
protecting wildlife 
lujan said the blm is determined to have a minimal impact on owl 
habitat as it seeks maximum timber harvesting 
were not going to just go in there and cut willy nilly any 
contract submitted to us must meet the test of the fish and 
wildlife service if we dont meet the test we dont cut he 
said

here are excerpts from the supreme courts 
decision wednesday upholding federal policies that favor minorities 
in awarding broadcast licenses 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
william j brennan 
it is of overriding significance in these cases that the fccs 
minority ownership programs have been specifically approved 
indeed mandated by congress 
we hold that benign raceconscious measures mandated by congress 
even if those measures are not remedial in the sense of being 
designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal 
discrimination are constitutionally permissible to the extent 
that they serve important governmental objectives within the power 
of congress and are substantially related to achievement of those 
objectives 
we hold that the fcc minority ownership policies pass muster 
first we find that they serve the important governmental objective 
of broadcast diversity second we conclude that they are 
substantially related to the achievement of that objective 
we have long recognized that because of the scarcity of 
electromagnetic frequencies the government is permitted to put 
restraints on licensees in favor of others whose views should be 
expressed on this unique medium 
just as a diverse student body contributing to a robust 
exchange of ideas is a constitutionally permissible goal on 
which a raceconscious university admissions program may be 
predicated the diversity of views and information on the airwaves 
serves important first amendment values 
we do not believe that the minority ownership policies at issue 
impose impermissible burdens on nonminorities although the 
nonminority challengers in these cases concede that they have not 
suffered the loss of an alreadyawarded broadcast license they 
claim that they have been handicapped in their ability to obtain 
one in the first instance 
but just as we have determined that as part of this nations 
dedication to eradicating racial discrimination innocent persons 
may be called upon to bear some of the burden of the remedy we 
similarly find that a congressionally mandated benign 
raceconscious program that is substantially related to the 
achievement of an important governmental interest is consistent 
with equal protection principles so long as it does not impose 
undue burdens on minorities 
in the context of broadcasting licenses the burden on 
nonminorities is slight the fccs responsibility is to grant 
licenses in the public interest convenience or necessity and 
the limited number of frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum 
means that no one has a first amendment right to a license 
applicants have no settled expectation that their applications 
will be granted without consideration of public interest factors 
such as minority ownership 
the commissions minority ownership policies bear the imprimatur 
of longstanding congressional support and direction and are 
substantially related to the achievement of the important 
governmental objective of broadcast diversity the judgment is 
affirmed

at the heart of the constitutions guarantee of equal protection 
lies the simple command that the government must treat citizens 
as individuals not as simply components of a racial religious 
sexual or national class 
social scientists may debate how peoples thoughts and behavior 
reflect their background but the constitution provides that the 
government may not allocate benefits and burdens among individuals 
based on the assumption that race or ethnicity determines how they 
act or think 
to uphold the challenged programs the court departs from these 
fundamental principles and from our traditional requirement that 
racial classifications are permissible only if necessary and 
narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest 
this departure marks a renewed toleration of racial 
classifications and a repudiation of our recent affirmation that 
the constitutions equal protection guarantees extend equally to 
all citizens 
the courts application of a lessened equal protection standard 
to congressional action finds no support in our cases or in the 
constitution 
in both the challenged policies the fcc provides benefits to 
some members of our society and denies benefits to others based on 
race or ethnicity 
except in the narrowest of circumstances the constitution bars 
such racial classifications as a denial to particular individuals 
of any race or ethnicity of the equal protection of the laws 
the dangers of such classifications are clear they endorse 
racebased reasoning and the conception of a nation divided into 
racial blocs thus contributing to an escalation of racial 
hostility and conflict 
we are a nation not of black and white alone but one teeming 
with divergent communities knitted together by various traditions 
and carried forth above all by individuals upon that basis we 
are governed by one constitution providing a single guarantee of 
equal protection one that extends equally to all citizens 
under the appropriate standard strict scrutiny only a 
compelling interest may support the governments use of racial 
classifications 
modern equal protection doctrine has recognized only one such 
interest remedying the effects of racial discrimination the 
interest in increasing the diversity of broadcast viewpoints is 
clearly not a compelling interest it is simply too amorphous too 
insubstantial and too unrelated to any legitimate basis for 
employing racial classifications 
the court has determine in essence that congress and all 
federal agencies are exempted to some illdefined but significant 
degree from the constitutions equal protection requirements this 
break with our precedents greatly undermines equal protection 
guarantees and permits distinctions among citizens based on race 
and ethnicity with the constitution clearly forbids

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge climbed 08 percent to a new high in may the government 
reported wednesday in a new sign the nations longest peacetime 
expansion will last at least through the end of its seventh year 
however the report also pointed to a sobering new dropoff in 
consumer confidence and one analyst said the economy could be 
close to a recession by the end of the year 
the commerce department said its index of leading economic 
indicators designed to forecast economic activity six to nine 
months ahead rose to 1462 percent of its 1982 base the previous 
record of 1460 was set in january 1989 
but analysts attributed the improvement mainly to overseas 
demand for us products and said us consumer spending remains 
weak some suggested that because of consumer restraint economic 
growth could slow further in the months ahead 
indeed the largest negative in the report was an index 
measuring consumer confidence which fell back from a slim advance 
in april it also had been negative in january and february and 
unchanged in march 
other recent commerce department reports and a national survey 
earlier this month by the federal reserve also point to a slowdown 
in consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the nations 
economic activity 
consumers are getting to be a lot more cautious than they have 
been said bruce steinberg senior economist with merrill lynch 
capital markets in new york the main reason theyre retrenching 
is they are weighed down by the debt they piled up during the 
1980s 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new 
york government securities firm also said consumers also are 
beginning to worry about their job outlook and a constant 
barrage of unfavorable economic news 
but analysts said exports appear to be picking up the slack 
stimulating the manufacturing sector which has been sluggish for 
months overall the economy grew at only a 11 percent annual rate 
in the last quarter of 1989 and just a 13 percent rate in the 
first three months of this year though that was enough to keep 
alive the expansion that began in november 1982 
the may leading indicators show that except for housing and 
construction the production side of the economy is beginning to 
recover said william k macreynolds forecasting director for 
the us chamber of commerce 
steinberg agreed but said its principally the export 
industries that are doing well right now and thats principally 
the high technology companies like computers and the aircraft 
industry 
and jones questioned whether economic growth could continue 
without a strong consumer contribution without it he said the 
economy could be close to a recession by the end of the year 
a consensus forecast of prominent economists surveyed earlier 
this month by blue chip economic indicators of sedona ariz is 
for 1990 growth of just 19 percent down from 3 percent last year 
and 44 percent in 1988 
nevertheless any growth at all would be welcome news for white 
house and congressional leaders who resumed negotiations wednesday 
on reducing the federal deficit in fiscal 1991 
a recession would make their task much more difficult since it 
would mean a loss of jobs and incomes diminished corporate profits 
and a drop in tax revenues at the same time the government would 
be called upon to increase spending on various benefits 
seven of the 11 leading indicators were positive in may a 
longer average workweek an increase in the price of raw materials 
a larger amount of orders for consumer goods higher stock prices 
a decrease in the weekly unemployment claims slower business 
delivery times and an increase in orders for new plants and 
equipment 
in addition to the drop in consumer confidence the other 
negatives were a decrease in the money supply a smaller number of 
building permits and a drop in manufacturers unfilled orders

a man who said he escaped a rampaging mob of 
youths the night a young woman jogger was gangraped and left for 
dead in central park testified today that he recognized a shirt 
worn by one of the suspects 
it was the first time during the trial of three youths charged 
in the attack that a witness provided any link to any of the 
defendants 
the three are charged with rape and attempted murder based in 
part on admissions they made to police after arrest on tuesday the 
judge said he would not let defense lawyers introduce iq tests and 
psychological evidence suggesting that their teenage clients 
confessed to crimes they didnt commit 
the witness gerald malone was shown a photograph of several 
youths on tuesday by an attorney for defendant raymond santana the 
picture was taken after the young men were arrested in the case 
malone failed to identify any of the youths by face but under 
questioning by assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer told 
jurors he recognized the shirt which had a large white logo worn 
by one of the teenagers 
the shirt was being worn by keith richardson one of three 
additional defendants in the case who will stand trial later this 
year 
malone said the shirt was similar to the one he saw on one 
of the youths who tried to attack him as he and his fiance were 
riding a tandem bike through the park 
on tuesday justice thomas galligan of the state supreme court 
new yorks triallevel court refused to admit reports from 
psychologists who examined defendants antron mccray 15 santana 
16 and yusef salaam 16 
during jury selection each defense lawyer suggested that his 
client had succumbed to lies trickery and intimidation and one 
alluded to how prisoners of war confess to things of which they are 
not guilty 
some people have a tendency to act under pressure said 
michael joseph mccrays lawyer 
i felt it was important for the jury to know how my client 
scored on his intelligence tests his iq joseph said on the 
one end you have an alan dershowitz and on the other end you have 
my client hes no dershowitz 
dershowitz is a harvard law professor and eminent defense 
attorney 
the teenagers allegedly were part of a larger gang of youths 
who rampaged through central park randomly assaulting or trying to 
assault at least eight people they encountered 
a witness testified tuesday that he and his fiancee narrowly 
escaped that night from a mob of 30 or 40 teenagers the same 
group prosecutors say attacked the jogger about 30 minutes later 
the jogger an investment banker who was then 28 was 
gangraped beaten and left for dead in a puddle of mud and blood 
she suffered brain damage and cannot recall what happened to her 
that night assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer told the 
jury 
malone 35 an advertising executive testified that he and his 
fiancee patricia dean were riding a tandem bicycle in the park 
that night when they spotted the mob 
they were spread out over the road and they were making 
noise they were making grunting sounds yelling he said 
malone said he and dean pedaled quickly through the group and 
escaped then called police malone said he was unable to recognize 
any of the gang members 
the youths are being tried in an adult court but if convicted 
face sentencing as juveniles to up to 10 years in prison 
three other teenagers face trial on the same charges later this 
year

in a separate case the court refused to reinstate an idaho 
womans childabuse conviction thrown out by the states highest 
court because the child did not testify rather a pediatrician 
testified at the trial about his interview with the 2yearold 
alleged victim 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
oconnor 
we think the supreme court of idaho properly focused on the 
presumptive unreliability of the outofcourt statements and on the 
suggestive manner in which the pediatrician conducted the 
interview 
viewing the totality of the circumstances surrounding the 
younger daughters responses to the doctors questions we find 
no special reason for supposing that the incriminating statements 
were particularly trustworthy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the making of a statement are the best indicators of reliability i 
doubt this is so in every instance and if it were true in a 
particular case that does not warrant ignoring other indicators of 
reliability such as corroborating evidence absent some other 
reason for excluding it 
in this case the younger daughters statements are corroborated 
by other evidence these facts coupled with the circumstances 
surrounding the making of the statements acknowledged by the court 
as suggesting that the statements are reliable give rise to a 
legitimate argument that admission of the statements did not 
violate the confrontation clause

prohibiting people from soliciting on post 
office property does not violate their right of free speech the 
supreme court said wednesday 
the justices voted 54 to reinstate the convictions of two 
political activists who solicited contributions and handed out 
literature on a sidewalk at the bowie md post office in 1986 
we are grateful the supreme court has recognized our 
customers need for unimpeded access to do business with the postal 
service said post office general counsel harold hughes 
the history of regulation of solicitation in post offices 
demonstrates the reasonableness of the provision here at issue 
justice sandra day oconnor wrote in the courts main opinion 
oconnor chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron 
r white and antonin scalia said a sidewalk on post office property 
is not a traditional public forum where freespeech rights are 
given enhanced protection 
providing the key fifth vote justice anthony m kennedy said 
there was no need to reach that issue because the disputed 
regulation is a valid one restricting the time place or manner of 
speech not its content 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens dissented saying such a sidewalk is 
a traditional public forum and that the postal regulation is being 
enforced in a discriminatory way 
marsha kokinda and kevin pearl were arrested outside the bowie 
post office aug 6 1986 after they refused to stop their 
activities from a table they had set up on a sidewalk adjacent to 
the building 
the two are volunteers for the national democratic policy 
committee the political arm of an organization headed by political 
extremist lyndon larouche 
they were convicted of violating a federal regulation banning 
soliciting electioneering collecting debts vending and 
advertising on postal property 
although there was no evidence the two had blocked or interfered 
with people entering or leaving the post office postal officials 
had received about 40 complaints before asking ms kokinda and 
pearl to leave 
the post office in bowie like tens of thousands in suburban and 
rural communities is a freestanding building with its own sidewalk 
and parking lot a municipal sidewalk runs in front of the post 
office property separating the parking lot from the street 
when the case was argued before the high court in february a 
justice department lawyer drew a distinction between municipal 
sidewalks where freespeech rights traditionally have broad 
protections and sidewalks on federal property 
the court today agreed with that distinction 
justice department lawyer john roberts jr last february also 
reported that the regulation is not being enforced against people 
who hand out leaflets or those who picket but only against those 
who solicit immediate contributions 
the case is us vs kokinda 882031

china has bought an additional 139400 metric 
tons of us wheat under a price subsidy program the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said six private exporting companies 
made the deals under usdas export enhancement program or eep 
delivery of the wheat is scheduled for october he said 
the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized to be sold to 
china under eep on may 2 previous allocations had been exhausted 
except for 5050 tons dickerson said china has slightly more than 
1 million tons remaining in its current allocation 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the latest sales would be about els at 
current prices estimated by usda at around 321 a bushel the 
wheat would have a farm51 million bush value of around 16 million 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged 1982 a ton or 
about 54 cents per bushel 
the subsidized sales were handled by continental grain co 
74400 bushels central states enterpribt they piled up during the 
1980s

november massacre of six jesuit priests their cook and her 
teenage daughter 
the warrant for lt col carlos camilo hernandez was issued by

logs of troops accused of the shooting camilo now an executive 
officer of the elite belloso battalion in the capital is the 
former assistant director of the military college where the troops 
were stationed 
the director of the college col guilllermo benavides three 
lieutenants and five enlisted men have already been charged with 
the murders

leftist rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front or 
fmln army positions at the college had come under fire several 
times 
six priests their housekeeper and her 15yearold daughter were 
roused from their sleep before dawn on nov 16 and killed by troops

that crucial evidence has been destroyed that military witnesses 
have been given assignments abroad to keep them from testifying and 
that the masterminds of the slayings were being protected 
the far right considered the leftleaning jesuit academics

researchers who injected millions of immature 
muscle cells into muscular dystrophy patients said wednesday the 
experimental treatment has proven safe and feasible 
the injections went into the biceps making the new work the 
first to show safety and feasibility for treating a large muscle 
the muscular dystrophy association said 
but dr george karpati of the montreal neurological institute 
said it will take months to find out whether the experimental 
therapy succeds in improving muscle strength 
karpati who led the research team spoke in a telephone 
interview before announcing results at a news conference 
the experimental procedure is aimed at duchenne muscular 
dystrophy a genetic muscledestroying disease that disables in 
childhood and usually kills in young adulthood from destruction of 
respiratory muscles 
in the treatment immature muscle cells called myoblasts are 
injected into a patients muscle the hope is that the myoblasts 
will supply muscle fibers with a gene to produce dystrophin a 
protein the fibers lack loss of this protein leads to the disease 
earlier this month researchers said the procedure spurred 
dystrophin production in a patients big toe 
karpati said the new experiment was on a larger scale involving 
50 to 60 injections into a larger muscle and delivering 60 million 
myoblasts throughout each treated bicep 
one patient was treated in april and two others later karpati 
said the boys are ages 6 and 8 
the myoblasts were generated from muscle samples no bigger than 
a pencil eraser taken from the boys fathers he said

of blackowned broadcasters said the decision means the fccs 
ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward 
without fear of constitutional challenge 
while this still is not at the level we would like to see 
we are pleased that the ability of the fcc to utilize policies to 
increase ownership will be allowed to continue and expand 
before the fcc established the rules in 1978 blacks owned about 
30 radio stations and one television station according to the 
national association of blackowned broadcasters now blacks own 
182 radio stations and 17 television stations the group said 
wednesday 
that represents an increase from 1 percent to about 35 percent 
of the nations radio and tv stations the fcc said 
those numbers are likely to grow now that the legal 
uncertainties have been lifted from the rules broadcasters said 
eddie fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said the decision affirms the fccs ability to 
improve the underrepresentation of minorities in broadcast 
ownership 
lois wright vice president and corporate counsel for one of the 
nations largest blackowned broadcasting companies inner city 
broadcasting corp in new york city said the fcc rules have been 
working effectively and i think theyll work more effectively 
now youre likely to get more deals involving minority 
broadcasters 
the rules upheld wednesday award preference to minorities 
seeking broadcast licenses the fcc comparative licensing 
process also gives preference to competing applicants based on 
other factors such as whether prospective owners plan to operate 
the station female applicants also receive extra points but the 
court said it was not ruling on gender preference 
the court wednesday also upheld separate rules known as the 
distress sale policy that allow a broadcaster faced with the 
loss of his license to sell to a minorityowned business at 75 
percent of a stations market value 
im overjoyed said kernie anderson general manager of 
wdasamfm in philadelphia this reflects a continuation of a 
policy that has benefited not only africanamericans but women and 
the entire nation it has made for greater diversity in our 
industry anderson said 
for the supreme court to uphold the righteousness of what 
indeed was a just action by the commission is appreciated by an 
africanamerican anderson said 
wdas was one of the first stations sold under the distress sale 
policy 
fcc policy also allows anyone who sells a radio or tv station or 
cable system to defer capital gains taxes on the sale if the buyer 
is a member of a minority this socalled tax certificate policy 
was not in question wednesday at the court

czechoslovakias internal security agency tested 
semtex on a passenger aircraft in 1984 and found that just seven 
ounces of the explosive could destroy a plane in flight according 
to a british television documentary 
semtex has been implicated in the destruction of pan am flight 
103 in december 1988 in which 270 people died 
the hourlong this week documentary for thames television 
scheduled for broadcast thursday night shows spectacular 
explosions filmed by the former marketing director at the factory 
that produced semtex 
the tests in october and november of 1984 were an antiterrorist 
exercise said maj zbynek hybl identified as a member of the 
parliamentary special operations group allied with the 
czechoslovak secret police 
hybl said only four other people were involved in the tests 
which were conducted on a sovietbuilt ilyushin 18 he said the 
results were not passed to any terrorist group 
paul wilkinson professor of international relations at st 
andrews university in scotland and an expert on terrorism said in 
a telephone interview that czechoslovakia had no need for an 
antiterrorist program 
there was never a terrorist threat within czechoslovakias 
borders nor had a czech aircraft ever been threatened by attack 
with a sabotage bomb wilkinson said 
czechoslovakias previous communist government had a 
reputation for passing on specialized knowledge not only to their 
own operatives but on a very selective basis to chosen proxies and 
clients which i assume and i think most students of the subject 
assume had to be approved at a very high level with the 
knowledge and consent of the kgb he said 
semtex is made only in czechoslovakia and president vaclav 
havel has confirmed that the previous communist regime sold nearly 
1000 tons of it to the government of libyas col moammar gadhafi 
the documentary says hybls special operations group was 
based in brezany castle near prague where the interior ministry 
also had a training program for third world security agents 
we wanted to find out what strength of charge you would need 
to blow a hole through the fuselage of the plane said hybl 
whose remarks were translated by thames television 
that was the most important piece of information we needed we 
tried every explosive we could get hold of everything from 
military to civilian 
as far as the czechoslovakian explosives we had were 
concerned we discovered that a charge weighing 200 grams seven 
ounces would be more than enough to blow a hole in the fuselage 
which would be large enough to cause the plane to decompress in 
flight 
those tests produced jagged holes about the size of a dinner 
plate in the plane 
scottish police have said pan am flight 103 a boeing 747 was 
destroyed by a small amount of explosive hidden in a radiocassette 
player 
the documentary shows 8mm color film taken by bohumile sole who 
said he retired last year as the semtex factorys marketing 
director 
they said they wanted me to teach them how to work with semtex 
because they had not worked with semtex before sole said 
they didnt even know how to design a charge so they simply 
wanted to know how effective semtex was what its characteristics 
were when it was applied to various parts of the aircraft 
wilkinson said much is still unknown about the assistance that 
communist governments gave terrorist groups 
hungarian interior minister balazs horvath said tuesday that the 
former communist leadership had sheltered ilich ramirez sanchez 
the terrorist known as carlos who organized an attack on opec 
headquarters in vienna in 1975 former interior minister andras 
benkei described the charge as nonsense 
east german interior minister petermichael diestel has said 
former communist leader erich honecker and his security chief made 
hospitality to west german terrorists a personal hobby 
information provided by a former highranking east german secret 
police officer recently has led to the arrest of nine suspected 
members of the red army faction

foreign commentators on wednesday welcomed 
president bushs concession on tax increases but expressed 
skepticism that the huge us budget deficit would be reduced 
substantially 
financial markets had a mixed and slightly nervous reaction the 
dollar fell against other major currencies around the globe stock 
prices soared in tokyo and european stock markets shrugged off the 
news 
abandoning his readmylips nonewtaxes campaign pledge 
bush on tuesday conceded that higher taxes would be required to get 
the deficit under control the white house would not specify any 
tax increases or program cuts 
the us deficit could total more than 200 billion in the next 
fiscal year 
us trading partners for years have clamored for the united 
states to cut its red ink which pushes us interest rates higher 
that puts upward pressure on foreign interest rates high rates 
anywhere slow economic growth 
at economic summit after economic summit we have consistently 
called for imbalances to be corrected a british government 
official said on condition of anonymity i would have thought 
that he bush would get more accolades from abroad than at home 
the news was prominently displayed in the foreign press 
under the headline read my lips again the times of london 
editorialized given the stake held by the rest of the world in 
the orderly cutting of a deficit that is plainly out of control a 
sigh of relief is called for 
some newspapers couldnt resist a dig 
the financial page of amsterdams de volkskrant newspaper 
cynically wrote the top of its lead story like a fairy tale once 
upon a time he told the american people he would resist with all 
his might any increase in taxes 
the milan daily corriere della seras headline said in part 
to contain the deficit he has to eat his words 
the dollar fell on the prospect that tax increases would lower 
us interest rates 
eiichi seino a dealer with fuji bank in tokyo said japanese 
investors now think the us monetary policy is moving toward 
relaxation 
a trader in milan said were seeing small nervous movements 
but no big swings the europeans are going to let the united states 
decide in which direction to send the dollar 
ian francis a director at morgan grenfell and co in london 
said the foreign exchange market might have overreacted the us 
federal reserve board is unlikely to do an aboutface on its tight 
monetary stand on the basis of bushs turnaround he said 
meanwhile the news helped send the tokyo stock exchanges key 
index the 225share nikkei stock average soaring 74098 points 
or 229 percent to close at 3231275 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
was down 263 points or 11 percent at 23735 traders mostly 
cited concern about weakness in the stock index futures market 
but traders also said there was concern that bushs statement 
would lead to a lower dollar which in turn could hurt the profits 
of dollarearning companies 
the amsterdam frankfurt milan and paris stock markets showed 
little reaction 
geoffrey dennis chief international economist at james capel 
and co in london said he expects the bush administration to leave 
income taxes alone and instead raise tobacco and alcohol duties 
but that wont be enough he said 
when this comes down to it we will still be faced with a huge 
budget cutting task dennis said 
the times of london concluded that bush must resist a renewed 
urge to spend 
he should do so with all the political strength he has 
economic stability across the world depends on it the times said

despite the rise of conservative foes a top 
official said wednesday it is unlikely next weeks pivotal 
gathering of soviet communists will be postponed or will turn 
against mikhail s gorbachev 
vadim a medvedev the partys ideology chief and member of its 
politburo also said the platform and rules that the party 
leadership will propose to the congress have been reworked in 
response to criticism from both left and right 
in the new documents the party takes a repentant tone about its 
blame for the countrys ills 
medvedevs comments and the revisions of the main congress 
documents just four days before the 4700 delegates converge on 
moscow showed the leaderships deep concern about keeping the 
party together reformers say conservative foes of gorbachev could 
dominate the gathering undermine him as he tries to pull the 
country out of a deep economic and political crisis and force 
progressives to quit the party 
the reformminded president of the russian republic boris n 
yeltsin urged tuesday that the 28th communist party congress be 
postponed until autumn to stabilize the political situation 
medvedev said other communist officials also want to delay the 
congress now scheduled to start monday because there have been 
too many political meetings lately but he said a delay was 
unlikely 
i believe the train has already left the station and we 
should stick to the original date he told a news conference he 
added that the leadership had contacted delegates across the 
nation and most oppose a delay 
the issue is expected to come up friday at a meeting of the 
partys 249member policymaking central committee that body will 
review the timing of the congress and discuss the main congress 
documents medvedev said 
yeltsin has predicted a real struggle at the central 
committee meeting over the congress timing 
a postponement could prevent hardliners from capitalizing on 
their successes last week at a meeting of party members from the 
russian federation the largest soviet republic 
some traditionalminded soviet communists demand the resignation 
of gorbachev who holds the posts of soviet president and general 
secretary of the communist party but occupies a shrinking middle 
ground in soviet politics 
but medvedev told reporters he was confident that supporters of 
gorbachevs perestroika or reform program would gain the upper 
hand 
we expect healthy perestroika forces to take care of that 
i am convinced those forces are in the majority he said 
he declined to predict how gorbachev would fare if his most 
prominent conservative foe politburo member yegor k ligachev ran 
against him for party chief at the congress 
under draft rules that may be changed in a revision to be 
published thursday the congress would be urged to eliminate the 
position of party general secretary the post gorbachev now holds 
and replace it with a chairman 
it also would elect a new central committee and could be called 
upon to replace the 12man politburo with a larger more 
representative body 
despite uncertainty surrounding the congress the central 
committee published a program statement wednesday that the 
congress will be asked to approve medvedev said the partys 
positions originally published in february were revised after 
consultations with representatives of the democratic platform and 
marxist platform progressive and conservative groups respectively 
the program spread across almost two pages of the communist 
party daily pravda pays tribute to communist idols marx lenin and 
engels but not marxismleninism the way of thinking long at the 
basis of soviet ideology 
it emphasizes instead that good ideas should be drawn from all 
currents of thought 
the soviet unions main problem it says is the previous 
distortion of socialism 
false ideas about socialism as a society based on the state 
monopoly on property and dictatorship led by the partystate brass 
in the name of the proletariat led to tyranny and lawlessness and 
the alienation of people from property and authority the 
committee said 
the program also 
says party units should be allowed to remain in the kgb and 
army but should be clearly separate from the basic power structure 
backs many of gorbachevs reforms already under way including 
the transition to a market economy and the partys rejection of its 
former political monopoly 
proposes more independence for party organizations in the 15 
soviet republics and allows for the possibility of various 
platforms in the party without actually approving fullfledged 
factions

the interior minister on wednesday 
accused the former communist leaders of harboring terrorists 
including the mastermind of a 1975 attack on an opec meeting in 
vienna that killed three people 
the cabinet minister balasz horvath said three documents from 
the former communist government indicated the terrorists used 
hungary as a base horvath ordered an investigation into the 
responsibilities of communist officials in sheltering terrorists 
three former communist officials named by horvath former 
interior minister andras benkei former president karoly nemeth and 
highranking party official antal gyenes have denied any 
knowledge of or role in sheltering terrorists 
unlike other eastern european countries where communists were 
removed from power in hungary no communist leader has been 
arrested or charged in connection with activities during 45 years 
of communist rule 
horvath said it was obviously a political decision to let 
these people terrorists come and stay in hungary 
it remains to be proved that they were undergoing training 
here but the inventory seems to point in a certain direction he 
told reporters he did not elaborate 
he said ilich ramirez sanchez alias carlos who masterminded 
the opec attack was among those who had been in hungary ramirez 
sanchez has been blamed for a series of assassinations in 1975 he 
headed interpols mostwanted list 
horvath said the deputy national police chief andras turos 
went to him with the information over the weekend 
he said the government documents included a 1979 interior 
ministry report on the arrival of carlos and his group and a 1980 
ministry report saying the terrorists left behind explosives guns 
rockets and rocket launchers 
horvath said it is not known where the group obtained these 
items 
he said a 1980 letter from carlos to former communist party 
leader janos kadar thanked kadar for allowing the group to use 
hungary as a base 
benkei was quoted by the nepszava newspaper on wednesday as 
saying this must be a misunderstanding i did not deal with such 
matters i retired in 1980 hiding people nonsense lies 
nepszabadsag which used to be the organ of the communist party 
stated that according to their information carlos and his 
associates were indeed in hungary in those years 
citing a wellinformed but unnamed source the paper stated 
that a very small circle of leaders knew about the authorization 
and their stay was safeguarded by state security organs 
according to the information we have their stay was not 
linked to any terrorist action but was to provide the terrorists 
rest and recreation nepszabadsag reported wednesday 
another budapest daily magyar hirlap said wednesday that there 
had been a terrorist training camp at csopak on the northern shore 
of lake balaton but provided no further information horvath told 
reporters that there has been no evidence uncovered so far that 
carlos and his group were in csopak

ivana trump her family demoted to a 450000 
monthly allowance because of the donalds financial pickle should 
bail out before she goes down with the yacht says one celebrity 
divorce lawyer 
she should proceed to grab the money and run attorney raoul 
felder said wednesday the real problem is i dont know if she 
can grab the money any more shes got to have the board of 
directors of various banks decide whether to give her the 25 
million 
john scanlon a spokesman for mrs trump said she had no plans 
to drop her lawsuit demanding half of her debtridden estranged 
husbands assets she is contesting a premarital agreement that 
reportedly would give her 25 million plus a 7 million mansion 
it was only a few months ago when mr trumps marital 
problems were making news that the general opinion was that his 
wife ivana had made a bad deal when she agreed to take only 25 
million in case of a divorce observed the new york times that 
no longer seems so paltry 
shes painted into a corner there are a lot of creditors who 
have to be paid said felder if i were her adviser i would 
tell her you have a wonderful world to conquer all the glitter 
has gone out of trump and now is floating around her 
in fact felder suggests that the timing is right for mrs trump 
to cash in on her own cachet for instance as a spokeswoman for a 
cosmetics firm 
whether mrs trump gets wind of felders advice or not her 
accountants should be relieved that its free the flamboyant 
divorce lawyer who has represented the exwives of mike tyson mel 
brooks martin scorsese and robin leach among others charges 500 
an hour 
shes had a significant number of offers for business 
opportunities in the licensing field and product endorsements 
said scanlon right now shes getting her children settled for 
the summer shell look at those in the fall 
mrs trumps own attorney michael kennedy doesnt discuss her 
case with reporters its public knowledge though that a group of 
banks will closely monitor donald trumps personal and business 
dealings for years to come as a condition of a 65 million bailout 
announced tuesday 
the banks crimped the familys monthly allowance to 450000 and 
will pare it to 300000 by 1992 in comparison trump reportedly

a usfinanced plane load of relief supplies 
worth 470000 was dispatched wednesday from basel switzerland 
for victims of the iranian earthquake us officials said 
included in the cargo purchased and flown to iran by the red 
cross were five electrical generators 645 tents and 20000 worth 
of antibiotics and other medical supplies 
the assistance is the second round of american government 
assistance earlier this week the red cross flew to iran 225000 
worth of usdonated blankets tents water jugs and 
searchandrescue equipment 
meanwhile private us humanitarian organizations have 
dispatched an additional 17 million in assistance for victims of 
the earthquake state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
said 
ms tutwiler said she knew of no direct contacts between us 
and iranian officials on the aid were doing it all through the 
red cross and through the swiss embassy in tehran which 
represents us interests there she added 
my understanding of how all of this is working is that they 
the iranians are making their needs known through the red 
crescent society to the red cross and that various countries 
including our own are responding based on those needs she 
said 
she said she kne of no additional flights of relief supplies 
but added that she cant rule out that another request will come 
in and that we would certainly fill it 
the iranian government has agreed to accept assistance from the 
united states and most other governments but it insists the 
assistance be channeled through the red cross or other private 
relief groups 
the iranian foreign minister has said his country welcomes help 
due to the magnitude of the earthquake in which an estimated 
50000 people died 200000 were injured and a halfmillion have 
been left homeless 
the united states broke relations with iran in 1980 after the 
seizure of the us embassy and the taking of american hostages in 
november 1979 the last 52 were released in january 1981 
six americans are now being held hostage in lebanon by militants 
believed to be under iranian influence

despite international 
criticism nelson mandela has not renounced violent struggle 
against apartheid because of fears of losing black supporters and a 
major bargaining chip 
mandelas african national congress says it cannot disavow 
violence until apartheid is abolished the anc says it must keep 
its armed wing as long as the government and rightwing white 
groups retain massive military power and unarmed black protesters 
are being killed 
black leaders caution against comparing the antiapartheid 
struggle to the nonviolent civil rights movement in the american 
south in the 1960s nonviolence is not realistic in a country 
where the white government has used force for decades to suppress 
blacks they say 
civil rights movements in the united states were often aimed at 
local governments and laws instead of the federal government 
federal courts and troops often acted to protect civil rights 
activists and restrain local officials and police 
despite controversy in the united states and europe over 
mandelas refusal to renounce violence the anc has all but 
suspended its armed struggle due to several factors 
the legalization of the anc in february a call for negotiations 
by president fw de klerk and reductions in aid from the soviet 
union and eastern europe have led the anc to stop highprofile 
attacks 
even before these developments the ancs armed struggle never 
posed a serious threat to the government 
mandela launched the guerrilla campaign in 1961 a year after 
the anc was outlawed but attempts to build an effective military 
force in south africa failed because of internal problems and the 
superiority of security forces 
the few attacks blamed on the anc in recent months have been 
hitandrun attacks on police stations or government buildings that 
caused minor damage such attacks appear to be the work of small 
groups operating independently and there has been no evidence of 
the anc directing any operations 
but the armed struggle has had a strong psychological impact on 
whites and been a major symbol of resistance to many blacks young 
blacks believe the armed struggle has been the one way they have 
been able to fight apartheid 
mandela risks losing the support of thousands of blacks if he 
renounces the armed struggle before apartheid is abolished such 
young blacks hardened by decades of violence and repression 
glorify strength and believe only violence can end apartheid 
many of the youngsters are not really interested in 
negotiation in fact they have become a little bit angry anc 
leader walter sisulu said 
radical groups that espouse violence such as the pan african 
congress claim they are attracting thousands of former anc members 
disillusioned by mandelas moderate line the anc and allied groups 
are locked in a violent struggle with rival black organizations 
that has cost thousands of lives 
antiapartheid leader archbishop desmond tutu and other 
religious leaders have urged the anc to at least suspend the armed 
struggle to help build peace 
but the threat of armed struggle is one of the ancs best 
bargaining chips in pending negotiations with the government on 
ending apartheid the anc says it cannot renounce violence without 
similar government concessions 
mandela and other black leaders say the government retains 
massive military and police power and that blacks are still 
suffering oppression dozens of blacks have been killed by police 
gunfire in recent months including at least 11 in one incident 
mandela also points to extreme rightwing groups with thousands 
of members that are forming paramilitary groups to resist attempts 
to end white rule blacks must be able to defend themselves because 
the white government will not suppress such groups he says

a federal judge ruled wednesday that officials may 
extradite the bank of greeces former chairman who is accused of 
embezzling 200 million in a scandal that toppled former premier 
andreas papandreou 
us district judge douglas woodlock upheld a magistrates 
ruling that george koskotas 35 may be returned to greece on 
felony charges brought in the alleged scheme to siphon funds from 
the bank from 1986 to 1988 
koskotas who was suspended as chairman oct 20 1988 fled his 
homeland as the scandal surrounding the greek socialist government 
heated up he was arrested nov 23 1988 at an airfield in bedford 
woodlocks ruling upheld a magistrates aug 24 1989 decision 
that koskotas could be extradited on felony charges but barred 
extradition on a misdemeanor travel documents charge 
it is one more major step toward exhausting the legal 
process in trying to avoid being returned to greece assistant 
us attorney victor a wild said koskotas could take his case to 
the first circuit court of appeals he said 
koskotas washington dcbased attorney ron liebman was out 
of town and not immediately available for comment he has argued 
that his client would face retribution at home 
if this court sends mr koskotas back to greece he will be 
murdered liebman told magistrate joyce l alexander at last 
years extradition hearing the cards are stacked against him 
politically 
under the us extradition treaty with greece courts can refuse 
to return people accused of political crimes but prosecutors have 
argued that koskotas alleged financial scheme does not fit into 
this category 
the koskotas affair paved the way to papandreous election 
defeat last june amid allegations of corruption among officials in 
the ruling panhellenic socialist movement 
the former premier has been accused of authorizing koskotas 
scheme to siphon money from the bank of crete the banker has said 
he acted with papandreous approval and put the money into accounts 
controlled by the socialist party 
a special investigator in athens has been examining the alleged 
involvement of papandreou and four other former government 
ministers the greek parliament last september indicted all five 
men in the alleged embezzlement scheme no trial date has been set 
koskotas who is being held at the essex county jail in salem 
also faces a multimilliondollar civil lawsuit brought by the bank 
of crete in federal court in new york

the los angeles county board of supervisors 
voted 32 wednesday to reshape one of its districts to include a 
majority of hispanic voters the vote came hours before a federal 
judges deadline 
us district judge david kenyon ruled june 4 that supervisors 
deliberately spread the countys hispanic population across several 
districts when they changed voting boundaries after the 1980 
federal census he said that violated the federal voting rights 
act and imposed a deadline for 3 pm wednesday 
supervisor ed edelman whose third district was restructured 
said the new plan does great violence to the hispanic community 
its not fair to the public and the court will see that its 
unfair he said its an attempt for the conservative majority 
to keep control 
according to edelmans description of the plan he would 
probably face a strong challenge from a hispanic candidate in 
future elections 
the new predominantly hispanic district which edelman called 
octopusshaped includes his own home but transfers much of his 
liberal political base to the districts of fellow liberal kenneth 
hahn and conservative deane dana 
edelman and hahn had pushed to increase the number of districts 
to seven to meet kenyons demands 
the new plan is subject to the judges approval he set a july 5 
hearing 
kenyon has said that if the plan fails to correct the 
violations he will redraw the district in consultation with the 
plaintiffs 
hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the countys 87 
million residents but no hispanic has been elected to the board 
since 1875 
edelman was reelected june 5 to a fouryear term 
lawyers for the american civil liberties union and the mexican 
american legal defense and educational fund which joined the us 
justice department in the lawsuit said kenyons order put the 
election results in doubt 
kenyon has not said what he plans to do about the june 5 
election

genetically altered potatoes that could be 
naturally deadly to beetles are being field tested in the pacific 
northwest the agriculture department said wednesday 
the outdoor tests were scheduled to begin this week in prosser 
wash said geneticist charles r brown of the departments 
agricultural research service 
ultimately we want to know whether potato plants could use 
this genetic weapon to combat colorado potato beetles with little 
or no chemical insecticide he said 
brown is based at the agencys vegetable and crop research unit 
in prosser and is collaborating with other scientists from the 
university of washington seattle and another usda researcher in 
yakima wash 
the quarteracre potato plots are at washington state 
universitys research and extension center in prosser 
brown said the added gene is from a strain of bacterium 
bacillus thuringiensis or bt that lives in soil naturally and 
makes a beetlekilling protein 
the prosser tests were said to be the first in the united states 
involving bt genes placed in potatoes other researchers at private 
companies and universities however have raised tomato cotton and 
tobacco plants that use a bt gene and show pest resistance 
brown said the colorado potato beetle is probably the worst 
potato insect pest worldwide and that it has become resistant to 
many pesticides

environmental officials proposed a 160 million 
global fund wednesday to help developing nations build industries 
that do not rely on chemicals that damage the earths protective 
ozone layer 
they also offered to increase the fund by 80 million if china 
and india sign a treaty on saving the ozone layer the two 
countries have refused to sign the treaty because they fear the 
high cost of converting to ozonefriendly technology 
the unprecedented idea was announced at the start of a 
conference of environmental ministers and officials from about 100 
countries the fund would be voluntary but it could become a 
future model for how to pay for resolving environmental problems 
the united states which until two weeks ago opposed creating 
such a fund was posing one of the few obstacles to final 
agreement it demanded a permanent seat on the proposed 15member 
executive committee that would decide how to use the money most 
delegates favor rotating membership 
richard smith who led the us delegation in talks this week 
that led to the proposal noted that the united states would 
contribute about 25 percent of the fund our position is that any 
country contributing this much should be permanently on the 
committee he said 
some delegates speaking privately said the united states was 
prepared to compromise and final agreement would be reached by the 
time the meeting ends friday 
delegates are representing the 56 countries that signed the 
montreal protocol of 1987 that treaty called for a 50 percent 
reduction in the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs by 
1996 
the plan for the 160 million global fund was worked out in 
talks that preceded the formal conference 
dr mostafa tolba an egyptian scientist and executive director 
of the un environment program said delegates proposed increasing 
the fund by 80 million if china and india signed the montreal 
protocol 
far too much is at stake to contemplate failure we have no 
option but to succeed and inshallah god willing we will 
succeed he said 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said her government 
would make an initial contribution of 9 million 
we need to speed up action and set ourselves higher targets 
and shorter deadlines for reducing and eventually eliminating cfcs 
and halons she told delegates 
cfcs used in refrigeration insulation cleaning solvents and 
as aerosol propellents rise into the stratosphere where they break 
down in constituent chemical parts one of these chlorine 
destroys the thin shield of ozone that filters out harmful 
ultraviolet rays 
scientists say that without the shield life on earth would 
perish 
william reilly administrator of the us environmental 
protection agency told delegates scientific research 
monitoring and satellite observations have all left no doubt 
whatever that the ozone hole is not a theory but a menacing open 
window to cancers and cataracts and that that window must be 
shut

us agricultural exports to the major pacific 
rim countries are increasing again this year but the growth is 
smaller than in 1989 an agriculture department report said on 
wednesday 
exports to japan south korea and taiwan are expected to 
increase but will not match the 10 percent gain of 1989 or the 28 
percent jump in 1988 the departments economic research servce 
said 
agricultural sales to canada are expected to rise sharply in the 
fiscal year that began last oct 1 because of a change in the 
reporting system the agency said sales to australia and new 
zealand probably will increase 
economic growth in the developed pacific rim slowed for the 
second straight year in 1989 the report said rising interest 
and inflation rates and labor shortages in east asia are straining 
the regions economies 
one factor was a strengthening of the us dollar against the 
japanese yen which possibly dampened demand for american farm 
products the report said meanwhile the dollar fell against the 
currencies of south korea taiwan and canada which helped boost 
export prospects

boris yeltsin on wednesday ordered a freeze on new 
atomic energy projects beginning next year in the russian republic 
that comprises threequarters of the soviet unions territory 
a directive from the republics parliament signed by yeltsin as 
russian president and distributed by the official news agency tass 
charged that national government ministries are illequipped to 
process and store radioactive wastes 
the move highlighted concern about nuclear power in the wake of 
the 1986 chernobyl accident and was the reformminded russian 
presidents first direct challenge to the kremlin since he was 
elected last month 
the directive also called on the russian republics government 
to develop a proposal for banning the burial on russian territory 
of radioactive waste from other nations or in the other 14 soviet 
republics also beginning next year 
it was not immediately clear whether the order would cause a 
direct confrontation between yeltsins government and national 
officials over any specific projects 
a rising antinuclear mood across the entire soviet union has 
forced soviet officials to delay or cancel several nuclear power 
plants the last four years 
yeltsins directive also said the ministry of the sea fleet and 
the defense ministry added to the problem of nuclear waste the 
order did not directly say military nuclear projects must be frozen 
as well but appeared to include them 
the sevenpoint directive cited increasing stockpiles of 
radioactive wastes and the low technological level of the 
management approach to solving the problem of gathering processing 
and eliminating radioactive wastes 
it said that combination created an unhealthy ecological and 
socialpsychological situation in a series of regions of the 
russian republic 
the directive said the russian republic would ask that the 
kremlin write a program for dealing with radioactive waste that 
includes a time period for implementation and delineates 
responsiblity it called for the program to be worked out before 
june 1991 
the russian government was instructed to review all existing 
radioactive waste sites in its jurisdiction and make 
recommendations about how and whether they should be used 
until a national program is enacted the directive said it would 
be considered unacceptable to start construction of new atomic 
energy sites on the territory of the russian republic from jan 1 
1991 
the russian council of ministers was instructed to prepare a 
proposal to prohibit burial on the territory of the russian 
republic the final products of the activity of atomic sites from 
other republics and countries beginning jan 1 1991 
official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four 
reactors at the chernobyl plant in the ukraine caught fire and 
exploded april 26 1986 unofficial reports say 250 died 
the blast spewed cesium strontium and plutonium over a wide 
area of the ukraine byelorussia and russia and also sent a cloud 
of radioactive gas around the world 
this april on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the 
accident the soviet government decided to resettle 200000 more 
people living in the area of the chernobyl plant at a cost of about 
26 billion 
but soviets increasingly concerned about contamination of their 
environment also are worried about the safety of nuclear energy 
used in industry and to power ships such as ice breakers and 
submarines 
the soviet government has only recently acknowledged other major 
nuclear accidents last june officials said that in 1957 a tank of 
radioactive waste exploded at a weapons site in the southern ural 
mountains showering almost 400 square miles with radioactive waste 
and forcing evacuation of 10000 people

the supreme court upheld arizonas death 
penalty law wednesday in a decision that also removed a 
constitutional shadow from similar laws in idaho and montana 
by a 54 vote the court said the arizona law is valid even 
though judges not juries decide whether a murderers sentence 
should be death or life in prison 
had the justices ruled the other way new proceedings could have 
been required for the 88 people on arizonas death row and perhaps 
for all or most of the death row inmates in idaho and montana as 
of last month idaho had 19 inmates on death row montana had six 
no one has been executed in those three states since the supreme 
court allowed states to resume capital punishment in 1976 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals which has jurisdiction 
over nine western states including arizona idaho and montana 
previously issued a decision in conflict with the arizona supreme 
courts ruling in waltons case 
the federal appeals court threw out the death sentence of john 
harvey adamson convicted of murdering phoenix newspaper reporter 
don bolles in 1976 
wednesdays decision likely means the 9th circuit courts 
ruling on appeal by arizona before the justices will be set aside 
perhaps as early as thursday when some housecleaning orders are 
to be issued 
i think this moves us much closer to executions said 
arizona attorney general bob corbin but he added that the first 
executions might be as long as six months off 
the issues are the same in the adamson case corbin said 
corbin criticized the 9th circuit judges for what he said was 
finding some mickey mouse reason to overturn every death 
sentence that goes before them 
idaho attorney general jim jones said this removes probably 
the most serious impediment to moving forward with the death 
penalty in idaho in montana assistant attorney general pat 
schaeffer jordan said wednesdays ruling would apply there as well 
writing for the high court justice byron r white said 
convicted murderer jeffrey alan walton properly was sentenced to 
death for robbing and killing thomas powell near tucson four years 
ago 
powell on march 2 1986 was robbed in a bar parking lot and 
then driven in his own car to a secluded area and shot 
a jury heard testimony that walton put a gun to powells head 
and fired the fatal shot walton denied he killed powell swearing 
that a codefendant was the triggerman 
the jury did not specify whether it found walton guilty of 
premeditated murder or felony murder the taking of a life 
during the commission of a felony 
after the jury convicted walton judge g thomas meehan 
conducted a hearing without a jury as arizona law requires to 
consider all aggravating and mitigating factors in the case 
he sentenced walton to die in the states gas chamber and the 
sentence was upheld by the arizona supreme court 
white said arizonas law is not that different from floridas 
which the court already had upheld in florida a jury makes a 
sentencing recommendation which can be followed or ignored by a 
judge 
white was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens dissented 
in a separate ruling the court also upheld the death sentence 
of arizona death row inmate jimmy wayne jeffers convicted of 
killing his exgirlfriend in tucson 14 years ago the 9th circuit 
had upheld his conviction but struck down the death sentence 
the vote in jeffers cas was by an identical 54 lineup of the 
justices

a transportation department official said 
wednesday he is considering whether to close down hawaiibased 
discovery airlines for allegedly operating under illegal foreign 
ownership and control 
the threemonthold carrier flies six leased planes on 
interisland flights in competition with both hawaiian and aloha 
airlines who claim discovery is owned primarily by japanese 
interests and run largely by an italian 
patrick murphy the deputy assistant secretary designated to 
decide the matter said he would give considerable weight to 
the recommendation of an administrative law judge 
the judge ronnie a yoder declared tuesday that cancellation 
of discoverys temporary permit to operate would appear to be a 
more appropriate action than granting it a requested extension 
yoder said the airline and department lawyers imply in a 
proposed settlement that discovery does not qualify as a us 
airline the judge also said the airline admitted to substantial 
prior misrepresentations in seeking authority to operate 
the judge said the fact that the proposed settlement includes 
sale of a share in the airline to qualify it as a us airline is 
an admission that it has operated from its inception as a 
nonus citizen air carrier in violation of the federal aviation 
act and that its submissions to the department were false and 
constituted misrepresentation in violation of federal law 
such actions should not be rewarded with an extension of the 
airlines operating permit as proposed by the departments 
lawyers yoder said 
the law requires that us airlines have no more than 25 percent 
foreign ownership and that they not be controlled by foreigners 
discovery is 75 percent owned by philip ho who other airlines 
claim got his funds from nansay corp of japan ho is president of 
nansays operations in hawaii 
the judge recommended against the proposed settlement of the 
issue by discovery and department lawyers the proposal would have 
allowed ho to sell most of his stock in discovery and had the 
airline pay a 50000 fine for making misstatements 
the administrative law judge also cited evidence that franco 
mancassola an italian citizen is effectively discoverys 
executive vice president earning twice as much as its president 
we are disappointed that the administrative law judge did not 
concur with the consent order said discovery president don 
straight however we are gratified that he saw fit to forward 
the consent order to the decision maker for an expedited review we 
continue to be hopeful of a prompt and fair decision 
transportation department lawyers said problems with discoverys 
application were not intentional and would not warrant criminal 
prosecution 
hawaiian airlines however said it would ask the justice 
department to investigate discoverys actions in starting up its 
passenger service 
hawaiian in business for 61 years on tuesday announced a 99 
million suit against the new airline claiming lost revenue because 
of discoverys allegedly fraudulent actions 
a maurice myers aloha airlines president said the law judge 
has seen through the thinly veiled sham created by the nansay 
corporation and discovery

the peace corps is pulling its volunteers out 
of the philippines to make sure they are not killed or kidnapped by 
communist rebels the agency said wednesday 
all of the volunteers are safe and this is strictly a 
precautionary measure peace corps director paul coverdell said 
in a statement 
the agency suspended its program after learning that peace 
corps volunteers may be among those targeted by the armed wing of 
the communist party coverdell said 
he said the white house and the state department were involved 
in the decision to recall the 261 volunteers most of whom were 
working in remote rural areas with poor security 
for a month americans have been cautioned by the state 
department to be careful traveling in the philippines but they 
have not been told to stay away or to leave 
we see no reason at the moment to change the advisory 
said philip covington a department spokesman 
the travel advisory posted may 28 with the onset of 
negotiations over the use of the usrun clark air base and naval 
facilities at subic bay specified that serious problems exist 
in urban areas 
we have advised americans that a threat exists against us 
government personnel and facilities and the threat is heightened 
with the bases negotiations covington said 
the peace corps volunteers are scheduled to leave thursday after 
a special sendoff from philippine president corazon aquino they 
will fly to hawaii to finish their service or discuss other 
assignments 
coverdell stressed that the philippines program is being 
suspended not cancelled and said the agencys office in manila 
would remain open 
it is my desire that peace corps volunteers will soon return 
to the philippines coverdell said this program is too 
valuable to leave it in a state of suspension for any longer 
than is absolutely necessary 
the state department made clear that none of the present 
volunteers are likely to be returning to their posts in the 
philippines 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that after they arrive in 
hawaii the volunteers will attend a closeofservice 
conference at the university of hawaii 
some of the volunteers will go on to work in other 
countries she said others will be ending their peace corps 
service early 
a senior us official in manila said the move does not imply a 
lack of support for the aquino government concern that it might be 
viewed that way has to be balanced against the greater downside 
of having a peace corps volunteer kidnapped or killed said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the philippine military said last week that rebels in manila 
planned to target americans and other foreigners for assassination 
and kidnapping in the next six months the us embassy recalled 
all peace corps volunteers to manila over the weekend after 
receiving a report that they had been added to the target list 
the rebels have made no specific public threats against the 
volunteers but have charged that us and japanese aid workers 
secretly assist the philippine government in its counterinsurgency 
operations both the us and japanese governments deny the charges 
the communist new peoples army has been fighting for 21 years 
to establish a marxist government in the philippines the rebels 
are believed to have killed eight americans in the philippines 
since april 1989 
they claimed responsibility for the deaths of two us airmen 
last month near clark air base and threatened to kill more until 
all us troops leave the philippines 
some us officials have complained privately that the aquino 
government has not been aggressive in guaranteeing the safety of 
the estimated 140000 americans in the philippines senior embassy 
officials however have expressed satisfaction with security 
arrangements 
peace corps volunteers had been involved in education 
environment agriculture and community development projects 
throughout the main philippine island luzon and the central 
visayas chain they were recalled from the southern island of 
mindanao in 1985 because of lawlessness and never returned 
coverdell said more than 7500 volunteers had served in the 
philippines since 1961 when the peace corps was founded making it 
one of the agencys oldest and most successful programs

the leader of the usarmed rebels in angola 
is urging president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev to 
undertake a joint emergency airlift of food and medicine to 
starving angolans the rebel group said wednesday 
in letters to the two leaders jonas savimbi also called for a 
ceasefire in angolas 15year civil war and the creation of 
protected land corridors to allow safe passage of relief supplies 
savimbi who heads the national union for the total independence 
of angola also wrote angolas president jose eduardo dos santos 
urging him to accept the plan the organization said 
bush and gorbachev agreed earlier this month to mount a joint 
airlift of food for starving ethiopians with us food flown on 
soviet planes bush and gorbachev also discussed joint sponsorship 
of peace talks between savimbi and the sovietbacked government of 
dos santos 
in the first signs of possible peace progress unita and 
government officials held two rounds of talks in portugal in recent 
weeks but they are divided on how to proceed 
the unita announcement said hundreds of thousands of people face 
starvation in regions controlled by its forces as a result of 
drought in recent years 
dos santos in a letter to the house of representatives select 
committee on hunger estimated that 155 million angolans run the 
risk of death from hunger the letter dated june 7 and made 
available to the associated press said more than 500 angolans have 
already died because of the drought 
dos santos responding to a letter from the committee that urged 
him and savimbi to support international relief organizations like 
the red cross promised to cooperate 
but he suggested such aid would have to be distributed by 
angolan government agencies a move savimbi is likely to reject 
savimbis proposal for corridors of peace would establish 
agreed routes into each sides territory for the safe passage of 
international relief convoys 
the rebel chief said a similar approach worked successfully in 
rebel and governmentheld territories in sudan 
the united states secretly gives savimbi more than 40 million 
of weapons annually us officials say the soviets give dos santos 
at least 600 million annually

sorting out blood vessels and nerves price was in the operating 
room within another hour 
and within hour after that blood was flowing to the arm 
blood flow is essential to keep the muscle living taras

surgeons spent five hours reconnecting the large artery that 
brings blood from the heart to the limb reattaching the bone with 
a metal insert and reconnecting three large veins and three major 
nerves 
reattached replanted arms generally are functioning 
usefully taras said weve seen professional musicians have

meanwhile a bill that will help states get more money for the 
supplemental food program for women infants and children or wic 
was moving quickly through the house 
the house education and labor committee approved a measure by 
rep tony hall dohio to let states borrow a greater amount of 
next years wic appropriation to cover current shortages hall 
introduced the bill monday and a vote on the house floor could 
occur thursday officials said 
house members criticized the department of agriculture which 
administers wic for not seeking more money for the program which 
has been battered in at least 20 states by food price increases and 
rebate reductions 
its an absolute outrage said rep john bryant dtexas

president bush on wednesday offered to forgive 
a portion of 12 billion owed the government by latin american and 
caribbean countries and proposed a free trade zone for the entire 
western hemisphere 
the president also proposed debtfornature swaps to 
encourage thirdworld countries to protect natural resources 
bush in a major speech on us trade and investment policies 
toward the region offered new proposals centered around trade 
investment and the latin nations debt to the us government 
it marked the first time the administration had shown a 
willingness to write off a portion of the government debt which 
would still leave the 483 billion the latin nations owe us 
banks 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said 7 billion in 
lowinterest loans among the 12 billion was eligible to be 
forgiven but the process could take several years 
obviously its going to take a lot of consultation with the 
congress to work out the bilateral debt agreements with each 
nation he said 
the debt forgiveness would be contingent on economic and 
investment reforms the debtor nations would work out with the 
international monetary fund and the world bank 
the president speaking to administration officials and latin 
ambassadors in the white house east room said he wants to 
eliminate trade and tariff barriers between the united states and 
the latin and caribbean nations particularly with groups of 
countries that have associated for the purposes of trade 
liberalization 
the central american nations recently agreed to form a common 
economic unit known as the central american economic community and 
there have been several other attempts by latin american countries 
to cooperate on trade and economic matters in the past 
the united states already has an open trade policy with canada 
and is discussing a similar arrangement with mexico 
in his remarks bush proposed that we begin the process of 
creating a hemispherewide free trade zone to increase investment 
that we adopt measures to create a new flow of capital into the 
region and to further ease the burden of debt a new approach to 
debt in the region with important benefits for our environment 
bush said he was proposing a major new initiative to reduce 
latin america and the caribbeans official debt to the us for 
countries that adopt strong economic and investment reform programs 
with the support of international institutions 
brady told reporters that the proposals were designed to address 
problems that cannot be rectified under the brady plan that the 
bush administration put forward last year to deal with foreign debt 
to commercial banks 
that plan called for the banks to forgive part of the loans the 
international monetary fund and world bank would lend money to the 
borrowing countries to buy back old debt at a discount 
bush also said the united states wants the international 
development bank to create a new lending program for countries 
that take significant steps to remove impediments to 
international investment such impediments include bureaucratic 
and logistical blockades to potential investors he indicated 
the united states bush said is prepared in addition to 
contribute 100 million to a proposed idbadministered investment 
fund for the americas 
he said he will seek matching contributions from japan and 
europe to bring the fund to 300 million that would be used for 
grants to countries that make broad investment reforms 
on the environmental front bush recommended creation of 
environmental trusts into which loan interest payments on us 
loans can be paid the money would be used to finance environmental 
programs in the debtor countries he said 
these innovative agreements offer a powerful new tool for 
preserving the natural wonders of this hemisphere we share he 
said 
in response to a reporters question brady conceded that the 
administrations debt forgiveness plan for latin america could set 
a precedent for other parts of the world the new government of 
poland has been lobbying the united states and other western 
countries to forgive its 39 billion in official loans and saying 
such a writedown is critical to its economic reforms 
besides the debts owed to the us government the latin 
countries owe 483 billion to us banks brazils 191 billion 
is the largest portion 
john reed chairman of citicorp said after hearing bushs 
speech that it was the first time ive heard the united states 
government focus on economic development in latin america in a 
regional sense and giving it the priority the president gave it 
reed said citicorp is owed about 8 billion by latin american 
countries but he said were not uncomfortable with our existing 
exposure

a conservative fundraising group on wednesday 
announced plans to launch an ad campaign attacking us senate 
candidate david duke the former ku klux klan leader running as a 
republican in louisiana 
floyd brown founder of the republican challengers committee 
said the political action committee had targeted duke because he 
was a racist pretending to be a republican out of convenience 
he is trying to establish himself as the leader of the 
conservative movement and we have to stop that brown said 
duke is running against democratic incumbent sen j bennett 
johnston and republican state sen ben bagert the three will meet 
in an oct 6 open primary 
bagert is the gops endorsed candidate but polls have shown duke 
running second behind johnston if no candidate gets more than 50 
percent of the vote the top two votegetters will face off in 
november 
brown said his group hopes to spend 1 million to defeat duke 
however the group had just 8900 on hand as of may 31 and debts 
of nearly 80000 according to federal election commission records 
brown said he had 30000 in new pledges for the antiduke 
effort and was confident he could raise plenty more 
brown and his partners at the republican challengers committee 
earlier worked with another pac that spent 10 million attacking 
1988 democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis for granting 
furloughs to convicted murderer willie horton who raped a maryland 
woman while on furlough 
duke in a telephone interview criticized browns plans but 
said he was not concerned 
if they were truly concerned and truly interested in 
republicanism they would be spending their money against the 
liberal democrat j bennett johnston said duke a member of the 
state house i have a perfect voting record on conservative 
principles

a federal judge set at 68 million the value of 
an art cache seized by the us government that includes four 
watercolors painted by a young adolf hitler and photographic 
archives of prewar europe and nazi germany 
us district judge lynn n hughes also ruled tuesday that the 
items could have produced more than 11 million in income through 
the sale of reproductions during the years of legal wrangling over 
their ownership 
billy f price of houston who helped locate the articles in the 
early 1980s had sought to have them valued at more than 30 
million 
the latest findings open the way for price to seek monetary 
damages based on the income he has not received since the 
government seized the paintings said larry a campagna one of 
prices attorneys 
the us government which can not appeal any of hughes 
decisions in the suit until a final judgment is issued has argued 
that price is not entitled to any money 
the paintings and photographs were seized by the us army in 
1945 in germany 
the family of heinrich hoffman who operated a photographic 
business in europe before and during world war ii and who was given 
the paintings by hitler claimed they owned the items 
price a houston businessman and collector of hitlers work who 
helped the hoffmans locate the articles and bought an interest from 
the family has been battling the us government for their 
possession 
the judge last year ruled that the government had no right to 
the items in what may have been the first decision favoring a us 
citizen claiming articles captured in a war by the army 
in his findings the judge said the value of the watercolors lay 
in the fact they were painted by hitler rather than by an obscure 
early twentiethcentury german watercolor artist 
hitlers watercolors portray street scenes and war landscapes 
painted before and during world war i 
the photographs include one depicting rudolf hess with his 
family mickey mouse painted on a nazi aircraft and nazis engaged 
in horse play

a scholar said wednesday that a portion of a 
letter from the biblical strongman samson possibly a love note to 
the temptress delilah had been found among the dead sea scrolls 
john strugnell head of a 22member team of scholars with 
exclusive access to most of the unpublished scrolls said he 
recently stumbled on a fragment containing nine words and three 
lines of the letter 
it has to be a copy of a letter sent by samson but was 
it to delilah unfortunately we dont know he said adding he 
had deciphered little about what samson wrote at this point but 
would publish more details soon 
strugnell the worlds leading expert on the dead sea scrolls 
said it was clear from the first few words of the letter what he 
called the address that it was without question from samson 
he suggested that it may be a love letter because it fit into 
the context of erotic and sapient literature that developed in 
the early jewish period the letter was not signed he said 
no other information was made available about the letter 
samson whose story is told in the book of judges was known for 
feats of enormous strength such as slaying 1000 philistines with 
the jawbone of a mule but he was stopped by delilah who was sent 
by the philistines she seduced him learned that the secret to his 
strength was his hair and cut it off while he was sleeping 
strugnell a harvard university professor announced the 
existence of the letter as an example of discoveries that are 
expected in the near future from the scroll research 
he and other scholars on a fivemember oversight committee that 
controls access to the scrolls defended the slow pace of publishing 
manuscripts from the ancient library found at qumran on the dead 
sea from 194752 
they also responded to criticism that they unfairly prevented 
other scholars from looking at scroll fragments during a news 
conference held in conjunction with the second international 
conference on biblical archaeology 
shmaryahu talmon a hebrew university scholar on the israeli 
oversight committee told reporters measures had been introduced 
the past three years to expand access to set timetables for 
publication and to compile a catalogue of manuscripts and published 
scroll studies 
the pace has been speeded up without lowering standards of 
scholarship talmon said we will try to open up as far as 
possible the material we have 
talmon said scrolls have already been published and 50 plates of 
fragments that have not been assigned to scholars on the team will 
be open for inspection by researchers 
however he said access would not be granted to material held by 
the research team because scholars had invested whole careers in 
piecing together fragments and they should have the right to 
publish the material first 
it would not be fair to rob them of the fruit of their 
labor talmon said 
robert eisenman head of the religion department at california 
state university at long beach and a leading critic of the system 
said the changes represented some progress but that after 40 years 
scholars should have absolutely open access 
they drop new bombshells every now and then to deflect people 
from the basic problem he said referring to strugnells 
announcement control of the manuscripts is control of 
interpretation and control of the field 
eisenman reached by telephone in california said he and other 
opposition voices had not been invited to address the 
conference he accused the israel antiquities authority of 
acquiescing to the clubism that froze out more than 500 
qualified experts from studying the original manuscripts 
magen broshi curator of the shrine of the book where some 
scrolls are on public display disputed critics claims that less 
than half the documents had been made public 
he estimated about 70 to 80 percent of the 90000 words of 
biblical texts letters and other documents from the qumran 
library had been deciphered and published 
amir drori head of the antiquities authority which has final 
say over the manuscripts said a general deadline of 1997 had been 
set for completing study of the scrolls and the year 2000 for 
publication he said some material might be reassigned if deadlines 
were not met 
officials also announced plans to begin carbondating portions 
of the dead sea scrolls based on handwriting styles the earliest 
manuscripts were estimated to date to 200 bc and be the work of a 
jewish sect but some scholars suggest unpublished scrolls may be 
the work of early christians

senators of both parties on wednesday launched 
a drive to repeal federal sanctions against employers who hire 
illegal aliens saying the penalties cause discrimination in hiring 
in my view employer sanctions simply are not worth the price 
in increased employment discrimination and increased burdens on 
business sen orrin hatch rutah told a news conference 
he was joined in unveiling legislation that would repeal the 
sanctions by sens edward m kennedy dmass alan cranston 
dcalif dennis deconcini dariz and jeff bingaman dnm 
i support reasonable measures to achieve the goal of these 
sanctions kennedy said in this case however congress made 
the wrong move we aimed at illegal aliens but we hit lawabiding 
americans and it is time to rectify the mistake 
the 1986 immigration reform and control act designed to curb an 
influx of illegal aliens over the southern border calls for the 
sanctions which range from 250 fines to six months in jail 
depending on the circumstances 
the general accounting office reported to congress in march that 
the sanctions have caused widespread hiring discrimination 
against those with ethnic names or who appear foreign in the eyes 
of employers wary lest they make an error and incur a fine 
the repeal measure also includes provisions that would bolster 
the border patrol with additional agents and 50 million in new 
funds and toughening penalties for transporting and harboring 
illegal aliens 
reducing illegal immigration should be placed back onto the 
shoulders of law enforcement deconcini said 
sen alan simpson rwyo at a later news conference renewed 
his criticism of the gao report saying it was impossible to 
determine whether employer sanctions were soley responsible for 
discrimination 
he said sponsors of the repeal measure are now using the gao 
report as a hook to achieve their obsessive original agenda and 
goal which was to kill employer sanctions 
they today are making a last frantic and exasperated gasp and 
grasp at achieving their objective during this congress simpson 
said 
he said that if the sanctions are repealed illegal immigration 
will increase more illegal aliens will be exploited and some 
employers will return to the practice of paying these people 
peanuts and profiting from their misery and their labor

we suspect that in the technique used to measure and polish 
the mirror there was an error made in the primary or secondary and 
it resulted in the mirrors being made to the wrong number he 
said by wrong number he meant manufactured to the wrong 
curvature 
the two mirrors were tested individually on the ground said 
oliver and passed all tests he said they were not tested in 
combination on the ground because this would have required a test 
arrangement that would have cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
before it was launched nasa said the hubble operating from 
281mile orbit far above the obscuring effects of the earths 
atmosphere would capture views of the universe never before 
possible 
the five instruments on the craft the agency said would detect 
objects 25 times fainter than the dimmest seen from earth and 
would expand the size of the observable universe by 250 times 
objects in the farthest reaches of the universe some 14 billion 
light years or 82 billion trillion miles away would be visible to 
the hubble the space agency said since the universe is thought to 
be 15 to 20 billion years old the telescope would be seeing 
objects only a short time after the socalled big bang that 
astronomers believe is the origin of the universe 
in addition to power the agency said the hubble also would have 
an unprecedented clarity about 10 times that of telescopes on 
earth and would be able to hold steady for many minutes on 
extremely faint objects 
instead weiler said the flawed telescope now is able to gather 
only a fraction of the light that nasa had expected 
he said the telescope is designed to capture about 70 percent of 
the visible light from a distant star but with the focusing flaw 
it can now gather only about 20 percent of the light 
were a factor of three and a half off he said 
despite this nasa chief scientist lennard fisk said the flawed 
hubble still will be a valuable observatory 
youll find many fundamental discoveries from hubble as it 
works today fisk said at the news conferecne i think youll 
be very pleased with the investment even as it is today

in gilan province one person died and six others were reported 
seriously injured 
tens of thousands of people took shelter in tent cities set up 
with the help of foreign volunteers about a halfmillion people 
were left homeless by thursdays quake which registered 73 to 77 
on the richter scale 
officials at the red crescent the moslem equivalent of the red 
cross said they counted 40000 dead and 60000 injured government 
officials earlier said 50000 people died and 200000 were injured 
a red cross official said tuesday the death toll could reach 
70000 
more than 205 people hurt in the quake died of their injuries 
wednesday in hospitals in zanjan province the islamic republic

have hit since thursday 
two field tribunals were being set up in northwestern iran to

the courts would be set up in rudbar and manjil 
at a news conference in tehran the managing director of irans 
red crescent societies said survivors were being housed in more 
than 70000 tents sent to the region irna reported

equipment said seyfollah vahid dastjerdi the red crescent chief 
the first plane carrying iraqi relief supplies arrived 
wednesday iran and iraq fought an eightyear war which was halted 
by a ceasefire in 1988 
foreign aid has come from more than 26 countries including 
sworn enemies like the united states britain iraq and saudi 
arabia 
that has prompted a bitter debate among iranian leaders 
radicals say the donations should not lead to improved relations 
with the west and others who say they should 
radical members of parliament oppose ties with the west 
president hashemi rafsanjani supports better ties with the outside 
world 
some western diplomats say the quake and resulting international 
aid effort could lead to better diplomatic ties 
of course the goodwill gesture being shown by france and other 
countries will have favorable effects in future relations of these 
countries with iran french minister for humanitarian action 
bernard kouchner said in an interview published wednesday in the

three congressmen said wednesday that the bush 
administrations scaleddown plan to protect the northern spotted 
owl will force a court battle that will paralyze logging in the 
pacific northwest 
the president is leading us right down the road and into a 
legal disaster said rep bruce vento dminn and chairman of 
the house interior subcommittee on national parks and public lands 
the administration is putting us right back in court right 
back into paralysis in that area he said 
echoed rep ron wyden dore i think there are serious 
questions as to whether blm can scientifically justify its 
position i sense blm is wide open to a lawsuit 
and rep jim mcdermott dwash said the administration was 
flying in the face of the scientific evidence all they are going 
to do is precipitate lawsuits 
at issue is the administrations plan announced tuesday to 
save the owl placed on the endangered species list last week with 
far milder reductions in the timber harvest than environmentalists 
had said were needed 
the administration says it can protect the shy twofoottall 
owl by reducing timber harvest levels from federal bureau of land 
management forests from 950 million board feet annually to 750 
million board feet 
the administrations plan announced by blm director cy jamison 
will cost an estimated 1000 jobs over two years compared with the 
governments prediction of an 8000job loss this decade under an 
earlier plan by forest service biologist jack ward thomas 
congressional and environmentalist critics of the plan charged 
the administration was ignoring evidence that current forest 
management practices are inadequate to reverse shrinkinghabitat 
and decliningpopulation trends jeopardizing the owls survival 
environmentalists say northwest timber harvests must be cut 
nearly in half to ensure that the owl will survive 
vento said he was also angry about agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutters decision to postpone a more complete plan for protecting 
the owl until a newly formed task force can present to president 
bush by sept 1 a comprehensive proposal for protecting the bird 
while pursuing maximum timber harvests on forest service lands 
the president ought to get off the fence instead of passing 
the buck to another blueribbon committee vento said 
wyden said bush has avoided a detailed response because he wants 
to please both environmentalists and the timber industry 
at some point you cannot pretend to have it all ways you look 
at this and you get the feeling the administration is taking the 
position like somebody at a smorgasbord that just wants to eat it 
all you cant you have to make some tough choices wyden said 
environmentalists said the blms proposal is illegal because it 
does not adhere to the most modern comprehensive scientific 
information as required by the endangered species act 
this is voodoo biology said andy kerr conservation 
director for the oregon natural resources council 
even before tuesdays announcement environmental groups said 
they would likely challenge in court any action short of what they 
were proposing

read my lips yo george read this president bushs flipflop 
on his hallmark campaign pledge of no new taxes is generating 
more heat than a summer hot spell in death valley 
taxes and the hot air of broken political promises provided a 
combustible mix for people in the street radio talk show callers 
headline writers and late night comics 
i think all politicians have some little white lies in them 
said peter sienkowski 52 a dallas republican 
wabc talk radio in new york city played bushs oftrepeated 
campaign pledge with his tuesday statement that reducing the 
federal deficit would need tax revenue increases the 
aboutface prompted a torrent of calls 
how many times have we heard that phrase read my lips 
wondered paulette pettit of wabc there wasnt passion or anger 
among callers it was more a feeling of i cant believe i fell 
for that line 
ted obrien of wrko in boston home of defeated democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis said the phone lines 
sizzled wednesday 
it was the topic obrien said there is a sense of 
disappointment among his supporters those on the other side had a 
sense of let him twist slowly in the wind and there were those who 
said the duke would have done it 14 months earlier 
headline writers had a field day 
read my lipsi lied said the new york post on its front 
page inside was this line read his forked tongue 
the new york daily news offered bushs lips say the t 
word 
the timespicayune in new orleans had this reread my lips 
bush says taxes must increase after all 
late night comic david letterman on wednesdays show listed 
the top 10 other campaign promises bush has broken his list 
included a birthday joyride on the stealth bomber for every us 
citizen going 10 rounds with dukakis at trump plaza adding a 
mechanical shark to the white house tour and number one the nude 
elvis postage stamp 
bushs new pitch flopped in peoria where the president was 
pilloried 
i think it stinks said marsha barnes of that illinois 
community hes just like all the rest they promise you 
something then they get in office and break their word i wont 
believe him in the future 
hes a liar said susan russell a resident of the illinois 
city i never did believe that read my lips stuff and now i 
think all that publicity about his loving family was a lot of 
baloney 
robert miller a peoria republican who voted for bush said the 
presidents change of heart was predictable if not wellreceived 
dont they all break their promises once they get in office he 
said 
indeed bushs turnabout didnt come as that much of a surprise 
in a may 30 gallup poll 74 percent of the respondents said bush 
would not be able to keep his pledge of no new taxes 
an abc newswashington post poll of may 14 showed 49 percent of 
the respondents said bush should drop his promise and consider 
raising taxes to reduce the federal deficit thirtyeight percent 
said he should keep his word 
and who pays will have a big impact on how any tax increase is 
received 
an nbc newswall street journal poll last month said 68 percent 
of the respondents favor high taxes for the rich 
pollsters say bushs credibility hinges on whether the public 
sees the switch as a change of direction or the cold reality that 
taxes are needed to cut the deficit 
how people read the economy is the important context on how 
this decision will be read said andy kohut of princeton survey 
research our surveys show a willingness to pay more in targeted 
areas such as health care the war on drugs the environment 
some of bushs supporters grudgingly said he had no choice 
he wouldnt have done it unless his back was up against the 
wall when he said no new taxes i think he was sincere at the 
time said laurie ashcraft 45 a chicago marketing research 
manager 
i think the guys got some savvy for being able to recognize 
the situation and having guts to go against what he said earlier 
said jon simon 29 of boston i applaud him for it he finally 
took a stand and wasnt afraid to contradict himself 
but no reasonings appeased chago saldana 67 the owner of a 
tire shop in rio hondo texas a community of 2000 residents near 
the mexican border said saldana its a bunch of bull

the chairman of the house foreign aid 
subcommittee said wednesday he will support cuts in aid to israel 
next year if its government persists in expanding settlements in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the blunt warning came as the house approving a 157 billion 
foreign aid bill narrowly voted to preserve president bushs 
policy of not sending us aid to international family planning 
groups linked to abortion and agreed to keep money flowing to 
cambodias noncommunist resistance the vote on final passage was 
308 to 117 
rep david obey treading on a subject seldom mentioned openly 
in washington said he meant the comments as a very friendly 
warning intended to avoid longterm tragedy and a mountain of 
death in the increasingly unstable region 
if israel expands their settlements in any way or if they add 
a single new settlement i will make a flat commitment to support 
any request made by the administration to reduce aid to israel in 
next years bill the wisconsin democrat said he was opening 
debate on a 158 billion foreign aid bill for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 
obeys statement set him on a collision course with the newly 
installed rightwing israeli government which has promised to 
expand settlements in the territories seized in the 1967 sixday 
war 
obey said the amount of any aid cuts would be based on how much 
is spent on creating new settlements or expanding present ones 
israel is a sovereign nation and has the right to do anything 
they want but the us government has no obligation to fund 
either directly or indirectly settlements which we believe to be 
an impediment to the peace process he said 
the bill before the house included 3 billion in military and 
economic aid to israel which traditionally has been the largest 
single foreign recipient of us largesse a separate measure 
passed earlier this year included an additional 400 million in 
loan guarantees to build housing in israel for soviet jewish 
emigres 
ariel sharon the housing minister of the new israeli 
government has said israel will not settle any of the soviet 
emigres in the west bank or gaza and obey welcomed that promise as 
a positive step but his threat to cut aid applied to any 
settlement whether by emigres or others 
on the population issue the house voted 224 to 198 to send 3 
million through private groups for family planning and other health 
projects in romania whose people have for decades been subject to 
a government policy against contraception 
but the amendment offered by rep christopher smith rnj 
specifically excluded from participation two groups the united 
nations population fund and the international planned parenthood 
federation which participate in abortion counseling referral or 
services 
smiths opponents argued that those two groups are the only ones 
which now operate in romania so barring them would make any aid 
program for that country ineffective but smith and allies 
countered that bush would veto any bill that included funding for 
the two abortionlinked agencies 
the lawmakers also adopted 260 to 162 an amendment by rep 
stephen solarz dny to provide 7 million in nonlethal aid to 
the coalition opposing cambodias vietnameseinstalled government 
that replaced language in the bill barring any aid to the 
resistance a prohibition supported by members who feared the 
dominance of the khmer rouge in the coalition 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia in the 1970s and were responsible 
for the deaths of more than 1 million people in what have come to 
be known as the killing fields they are the strongest military 
faction in a coalition which also receives millions of dollars in 
covert us military aid 
solarz argued that the money is needed to keep pressure on the 
government to reach a peaceful settlement and house foreign 
affairs committee chairman dante fascell dfla said it would 
maintain at least the figment if not the reality of a third 
force in the country 
the bill is the principal vehicle for us military economic 
and development aid to friends and allies around the globe this 
years version begins what obey has called a planned 5year 
transition away from a past emphasis on military aid and toward 
economic support 
citing reduced eastwest tensions and an end to the cold war 
the house appropriations committee included new money for emerging 
democracies in eastern europe refugee and childrens programs and 
development in africa and latin america to pay for the increases 
the panel cut nearly 400 million from president bushs military 
aid request 
the bush administration agreed to support the bill on the house 
floor with the understanding that it would work when the measure 
goes to the senate to soften the military aid cut and other 
provisions it objects to 
high on the list of white house objections is language halving 
military aid to el salvador expected to be about 85 million next 
year and applying conditions intended to keep the warring 
government and leftist fmln rebels at the peace table 
negotiations on a new bipartisan policy toward el salvador are 
being conducted separately between secretary of state james a 
baker iii and a team of house democrats and republicans

abortion services are getting harder to find 
in rural parts of the country and in some areas women have to 
travel hundreds of miles to a provider a report by the alan 
guttmacher institute said wednesday 
nearly all of the nearly 16 million abortions performed in 1988 
were performed in metropolitan areas about 17 percent a total 
of 27000 took place in rural areas according to the survey by 
the independent nonprofit research group 
in 1979 when 15 million abortions were performed in this 
country about 45 percent of them around 67000 were in rural 
facilities 
as the concentration of abortion services has continued to shift 
from hospitals to specialized clinics women in rural areas have 
been hit hardest those women usually have had to rely on hospitals 
for abortion services since small clinics often are not economical 
in rural areas the report said 
our findings clearly show that access to abortion which was 
already a tremendous problem for women living outside of the 
metropolitan areas of our country is getting worse even without 
additional state restrictions that may result from any new 
legislative activity stanley henshaw author of the report said 
in a statement released with it 
in south dakota for example women living in the western and 
central parts of the state have to travel as far as 200 miles to 
the nearest abortion provider the report said 
it said that because of the long distances rural women are more 
likely to have their abortion later in pregnancy when the health 
risks are greater

a judge wednesday issued an 
arrest warrant for an army officer accused of destroying evidence 
in the november massacre of six jesuit priests their cook and her 
teenage daughter 
the warrant comes after widespread criticism of the 
investigation by a us congressional committee and leaders of el 
salvadors roman catholic church 
the charges accuse lt col carlos camilo hernandez of 
destroying the mission logs of troops accused in the shootings at 
central american university 
hernandez an executive officer of the elite belloso battalion 
in san salvador is the former assistant director of the military 
college where the troops were stationed 
the warrant was issued by judge ricardo zamora who is handling 
the politically charged investigation it asks military officials 
to arrest hernandez and hand him over to the civilian court for 
prosecution 
neither the armed forces press office nor the us embassy would 
comment on the latest development in the jesuit case 
defense attorney joaquin barahona said the judge based his 
warrant on the testimony of several witnesses as well as statements 
by hernandez himself 
hernandez is the tenth person charged in the case 
the director of the military college col guillermo benavides 
three lieutenants and five enlisted men have been charged with the 
slayings 
no salvadoran officer has ever been prosecuted for a human 
rights crime despite the deaths of tens of thousands of people at 
the hands of death squads linked to the armed forcesor president 
alfredo cristianis rightist republican nationalist alliance 
to date the only evidence presented against benavides has been 
that of other defendants which is not admissible in salvadoran 
courts 
however a key military witness appeared before the judge 
wednesday in a closed hearing 
col carlos armando aviles who reportedly blew the case open by 
telling a us military adviser who was responsible for the 
slayings arrived wednesday in el salvador from taiwan where he 
had been sent for military training after the jesuit massacre 
aviles is a key witness a defense lawyer requesting 
anonymity told the associated press if he testifies to what he 
has said unofficially it will be overwhelming evidence against the 
defendants 
asked about the latest developments in the jesuit case at a news 
conference wednesday cristiani would only comment if the judge 
thinks he has proof he should proceed according to the law 
the massacre took place amid a huge offensive by leftist rebels 
of the farabundo marti national liberation front who have waged a 
decadelong insurgency army positions at the college had come 
under fire several times 
the six priests and educators their housekeeper and her 
15yearold daughter were roused from their sleep before dawn nov 
16 and killed by troops of the elite atlacatl infantry battalion 
two of three lieutenants leading the death squad said benavides 
issued an order to kill the priests 
the investigation has moved slowly and there have been reports 
that crucial evidence has been destroyed that military witnesses 
have been given assignments abroad to keep them from testifying 
and that the true masterminds of the slayings were being protected 
the farright considered the leftleaning jesuit academics 
subversive because they blamed social injustice rather than 
international communist expansion for el salvadors revolution 
the rev ignacio ellacuria rector of central american 
university and one of the regions most respected educators was 
one of those slain 
the murders provoked an international outcry and calls from some 
quarters in the us congress for sharp cuts in aid to el salvador 
the largest recipient of us aid in the hemisphere washington 
currently sends el salvador about 1 million a day in economic and 
military aid 
the money keeps this small nation and its powerful military 
afloat cristiani has taken pains to assure us officials there 
will be a goodfaith investigation and punishment of those 
responsible 
at least 72000 people have died in the civil war most of them 
civilians 
the government is also under pressure from the rebels to resolve 
the jesuit case the rebels demanded army officers be made 
accountable for rights abuses at the latest round of peace talks 
that ended this week in mexico 
at his news conference cristiani said the talks which produced 
no substantive accords were positive in the sense that there 
were advances in the process of pacification

the head of the justice departments criminal 
division edward sg dennis jr is resigning to join a 
philadelphia law firm officials said wednesday night 
dennis resignation expected to be announced thursday creates 
another vacancy in the top echelons of the justice department 
which has been plagued by personnel difficulties in the last year 
but officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
denniss resignation as an assistant attorney general is unrelated 
to recent turmoil on the staff of attorney general dick thornburgh 
dennis who has spent most of his career as a justice department 
prosecutor will become a senior partner at the prestigious 
philadelphia firm of morgan lewis and bockius said one official 
this is for his personal and professional benefit the 
official said 
without disputing that two sources familiar with the situation 
said dennis had grown frustrated with thornburghs 
closetothevest management style that centralized decisionmaking 
in the attorney generals office these sources spoke on condition 
that they not be identified 
dennis the first black to head the justice departments 
criminal division will join the national litigation section at the 
firm 
morgan lewis and bockius has more than 600 lawyers in several 
cities including washington 
as a holdover from the reagan administration dennis long had 
plans to return to philadelphia where he was us attorney for 
five years before he became assistant attorney general in 1988 
officials said 
he commutes daily by train from his home near media pa a 
suburb southwest of philadelphia 
last year dennis served as acting deputy attorney general as 
well as head of the criminal division as such he was the 
highestranking black ever to serve in the department 
dennis who officials said would remain on the job through 
august is the second top justice department official to resign in 
the last two months 
in may deputy attorney general donald b ayer the departments 
no 2 official resigned amid great acrimony later accusing 
thornburgh of mishandling an internal investigation of an 
unauthorized news leak 
sources said ayer was also frustrated because he had been frozen 
out of policymaking decisions by the attorney generals top aides 
who worked for thornburgh when he was governor of pennsylvania 
several days after ayers resignation thornburgh resassigned 
two top aides spokesman david runkel and chief of staff robert s 
ross jr in an attempt to counteract criticism that he was isolated 
from the department and surrounded by political loyalists 
the president nominated william p barr assistant attorney 
general in charge of the office of legal counsel to succeed ayer 
as deputy 
barr told the senate judiciary committee at his confirmation 
hearing wednesday that he was asked by thornburgh to restore the 
traditional lines of authority in the department 
barr said that post of executive assistant to the attorney 
general which had been rosss job was abolished barr said he now 
reports directly to thornburgh 
the 40yearold barr who is acting deputy attorney general 
told senators that all the justice department components now report 
to the attorney general through him 
when ayer was deputy some divisions and agencies reported to 
thornburgh barr said 
barr told lawmakers that thornburghs staff assumed more 
responsiblities than the attorney general had intended because he 
had difficulty recruiting top people in the waning days of the 
reagan administration 
personnel difficulties continued after thornburgh was asked to 
stay on as attorney general in the bush administration 
his first choice for deputy attorney general robert fiske was 
rejected by conservatives because of involvement in the american 
bar associations judicial screening committee 
barr told the committee that thornburghs staff continued to 
retain many responsibilities because of the difficulty finding a 
deputy 
besides barrs appointment other nominations for vacant 
justice department positions are pending in the senate 
the senate is also considering the nomination of michael luttig 
to succeed barr as the departments legal counsel 
late last year carol crawford assistant attorney general in 
charge of legislative affairs resigned following a series of 
bureaucratic turf wars lee rawls has been nominated to head the 
office

more than a thousand callers have flooded a 
police hotline with reports they saw or spoke to the zodiac 
gunman but none has produced a firm lead police said wednesday 
mayor david n dinkins has offered a 10000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the gunman who 
has promised a death for each sign of the zodiac and already has 
killed one man and wounded three others since march 8 
investigators on the zodiac task force are using a sophisticated 
computer system to keep track of the hotline calls 
the computerized system enables us to do is make sure we 
capture all the tips all the information that comes in and gives 
us a chance to pull it up rapidly said police commissioner lee 
p brown 
you dont know which call you get or what piece of information 
you get will be that which you need to bring resolution to the 
cases he added 
the calls are checked and assigned a priority by supervisors and 
if theres a sign that something is really hot that will be 
dealt with immediately brown said 
the most credible sounding tipsters are interviewed by 
detectives investigators interviewed 18 callers on wednesday but 
believed their reports were unfounded said chief of detectives 
joseph borrelli 
police and news organizations have received six notes from 
someone claiming responsibility for the shootings in one of the 
notes the writer threatened to kill 12 people one for each 
astrological sign 
police have said they do not believe the gunman is connected to 
the killer dubbed the zodiac who claimed responsibility for as 
many as 40 killings in a series of notes sent to san franciscoarea 
newspapers from 1968 to 1987 
the latest shooting victim larry parham said he was questioned 
about his birth date by a stranger a few days before he was shot in 
central park parhams astrological sign cancer was referred to 
a letter left at the scene 
however another of the four victims said wednesday that the 
gunman who was wearing a mask said nothing to him before he 
opened fire this victim whose spoke to wnbctv on condition of 
anonymity said he did not think the man knew his astrological sign 
the police task force has grown to more than 50 investigators 
and they are consulting with people who have a knowledge of 
astrology brown said 
brown was atlantas public safety commissioner and headed the 
investigation of a series of child killings there in 1979 to 1981

all moslems must perform at least once in their lifetimes

ally in lebanon the only country where the late ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis brand of shiite fundamentalism has taken strong roots

custodianship on the two most sacred shrines hezbollahs

a blaze that killed six firefighters when 
it flared like a big blowtorch spread wednesday across 15000 
acres of arizonas most verdant pine forest 
a photographer who escaped the fatal firestorm tuesday described 
how he and others fled for their lives into a burnedout clearing 
there wasnt much time for thinking just survival said 
chad surmick all of a sudden the trees around us started 
bursting into flames it was like roman candles going up all over 
the place 
the firefighters were killed and five others injured when a 
dry thunderstorm struck the area tuesday driving the fire 
along the mogollon rim in all directions and trapping several 
crews said jim paxon fireinformation officer for the gila 
national forest in new mexico 
its just like a big furnace a big blowtorch kind of 
effect paxon said it built its own thunderhead from the fire 
that was a 40000foot vertical column five to six miles across 
the fire had destroyed about 50 houses and forced evacuation of 
700 others by wednesday 
the dead firefighters were five inmates from the perryville 
state prison west of phoenix and an administrative assistant to the 
warden at the prisons san pedro unit said corrections spokesman 
michael arra four of the five injured firefighters also were 
perryville prisoners while the fifth was from a tucson fire 
department 
the inmates were participating in a 5yearold volunteer 
firefighting program which had never had a casualty arra said 
surmick a photographer for the mesa tribune was with six other 
journalists and a number of firefighters when we started noticing 
the fire getting closer and closer and the smoke was getting really 
bad 
while he and others ran to a previously burned clearing the 
fire jumped the road behind them 
as we were running up the hill some of the tv guys were 
trying to film surmick said the firefighters were screaming 
at them this is not the time to be filming we are going to die 
if you dont get up that hill 
surmick and the others were trapped in the clearing for about 
three hours 
tanker planes and helicopters backed up as many as 1500 
firefighters and support personnel fighting the blaze in tonto and 
coconino national forests which was ignited monday by lightning 
firefighters also had to contend with a heat wave that sent 
temperatures soaring to an alltime record high of 106 degrees at 
payson 13 miles to the southwest 
smoke billowing from 30foothigh flames was so thick that 
command stations repeatedly lost touch with firefighter crews 
payson was choked with smoke and the smoke and ash reached as 
far away as show low 90 miles to the east 
tonto national forest fire information officer bob celaya 
estimated that nearly all of bonita creek estates a subdivision of 
57 summer homes had been destroyed the subdivision was evacuated 
monday evening and the residents of about 700 other threatened 
homes were told to evacuate tuesday

democrats responding to president bushs 
endorsement of possible tax increases offered a plan wednesday to 
cut billions of dollars in benefit programs such as social security 
and to raise taxes paid by some people covered by the retirement 
program 
republican congressional leaders meanwhile faced a budding 
rebellion over bushs tax turnabout 
white house and congressional negotiators searching for ways to 
cut the 1991 federal deficit began discussing proposals in earnest 
a day after bush said tax revenue increases are needed as part 
of a plan to cut the deficit 
democrats citing bushs concession offered a plan that one 
participant speaking on condition of anonymity said totaled 56 
billion in savings negotiators are seeking 45 billion to 60 
billion in new taxes and spending cuts for fiscal year 1991 which 
starts oct 1 
another official also requesting anonymity said the options 
came to 10 billion the official said one element was a 
threemonth delay in costofliving increases for benefit programs 
for which people qualify automatically such as social security 
pensions for retired workers 
under that plan the annual costofliving boosts would be 
delayed from jan 1 to april 1 for a savings of 3 billion 
the official said the suggestion for delaying costofliving 
adjustments ran into objections from sen pete domenici rnm 
and house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski 
dill rostenkowski said the political consequences of such a delay 
would be death the official said 
sen james sasser dtenn said the democratic package included 
reductions in medicare and federal employee benefit programs 
sasser also said the plan would increase from 50 percent to 85 
percent the amount of social security benefits subject to federal 
taxes for couples whose incomes exceed 32000 annually the tax 
boost would raise 31 billion next year 
were trying to be evenhanded about it titfortat said 
sasser theyre talking about taxes and were talking about 
reducing entitlements the bureaucratic term for benefit programs 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said the 
negotiators generally agreed that their goal should be to achieve a 
balanced budget by 1995 the grammrudman law requires the deficit 
to be eliminated by 1993 a goal that virtually everyone in 
washington believes cannot be achieved 
its fair to assume the targets are going to be changed 
domenici said of the series of declining annual deficit goals set 
by grammrudman 
in seven weeks of meetings only one proposal had been advanced 
a 51 billion deficitreduction package offered last week by white 
house budget director richard darman it was quickly dismissed by 
democrats as insufficient 
but sen pete domenici rnm said after emerging from the 
wednesday morning session of closeddoor bargaining the whole 
tenor has changed it is very determined it doesnt seem to be as 
acrimonious its how do we get there 
some other republicans not part of the negotiations didnt 
feel that way 
the president may well go into a back room somewhere and sign 
off on this deal but republicans havent said rep bob walker 
rpa who led a letterwriting campaign in the house against any 
tax increase 
negotiators said there was no attempt during wednesday mornings 
meeting to learn what taxes bush was referring to 
but outside the capitol meeting room where negotiators met 
democrats and republicans grappled for political advantage over 
bushs statement the president said tuesday that spending cuts 
changes in the budget process and a cut in the capital gains tax 
rate which everyone agrees would increase revenues atleast 
initially were also required to shrink a budget gap that could 
surpass 200 billion next year 
housing secretary jack kemp told reporters that revenues can 
come from many sources including a growing economy new federal 
fees or taxes on tobacco 
it certainly didnt violate in my view any pledge kemp 
said 
but many rankandfile republicans counting on the subject of 
taxes as a campaign issue against democrats were pained by bushs 
retreat from his promise of no new taxes 
sen trent lott rmiss collected the signatures of 12 of the 
senates 45 republicans on a letter saying the deficit must be 
controlled through spending reductions and economic growth not 
through tax increases 
on tuesday 90 of the 176 house republicans signed a similar 
note 
treasury secretary nicholas brady one of the administrations 
budget negotiators turned aside questions about republican anger 
over the presidents announcement 
all of us in the budget process have a very strong commitment 
to the fact that sniping and private opinions from the sidelines to 
gain political advantage are not going to help this process 
brady said 
i feel the presidents actions yesterday were an exercise in 
leadership that is why the american people elected him and i am 
sure they are going to look at it that way brady told reporters 
at the white house 
democratic leaders said they remained unconcerned about the 
petitions saying unhappy lawmakers might change their minds if tax 
increases were part of a solid deficitreduction package that 
included spending cuts 
im not going to write it off today house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash said of the prospects for passage of a budget deal 
the democratic study group a liberal research arm of the 
houses democrats released a letter to foley insisting any tax 
increases be levied on people with annual incomes greater than 
200000 annually the petition circulated last month was signed 
by 134 house democrats 
working and middleclass families have fought for a decade 
against declining wages while their tax burden has gone up the 
letter said

two helicopters carrying journalists 
collided wednesday afternoon as they were returning from a contra 
demobilization ceremony in the countryside a witness said several 
were badly injured 
in all the years ive covered the war ive never felt so 
close to death said ernesto mejia an associated press 
photographer aboard one of the helicopters it seemed unreal to 
end the war almost dying 
there were unofficial reports at least 14 people had been 
hospitalized a spokesman for the presidential press office said 
authorities were still compiling a list of the injured several 
hours after the crash 
mejia said 24 journalists were on board the two helicopters when 
they collided at 215 pm as they were taking off from san pedro 
de lovago a village where contra commanders had turned over their 
weapons to president violeta barrios de chamorro in a ceremony 
marking the end of the civil war 
the journalists were evacuated to managua about 100 miles away 
in helicopters from the united nationsorganization of american 
states force overseeing the contra demobilization 
when we reached an altitude of about 15 meters yards the 
nose of our helicopter dropped and we hit the other mi17 as it was 
taking off mejia said we felt a terrible impact and then we 
were on the ground some of our comrades crying 
after getting out as best we could we saw that the other 
helicopter had fallen about 200 meters yards away he said 
mejia said he and eight other reporters were in one helicopter 
and 15 were in the second 
we could see that barricada reporter guillermo cortes was 
unconscious and we told the oas people who got him out seconds 
later the helicopter caught on fire and burned to a crisp 
mejia said there were three reporters from nicaraguan national 
television on his helicopter along with freelance photographer 
arturo robles two reporters for barricada the sandinista party 
newspaper and two photographers from the presidential press office 
mejia said the other helicopter which was carrying 15 
journalists did not burn but most of its occupants appeared 
injured 
mejia said agence france press reporter lidia hunter a 
nicaraguan and afp photographer bruno martina an italian 
appeared badly injured and were taken to the military hospital in 
managua 
a univision cameraman appeared to have suffered serious injuries 
in both legs and was unable to move mejia said 
peter northall a photographer for agence france press said he 
suffered only minor injuries in the crash 
a third helicopter carrying journalists made the flight to 
managua safely mejia said

the legislature gave final approval 
wednesday night to the strictest state abortion bill in the nation 
and passed it along to gov buddy roemer who has promised a veto 
the bill calls for prison terms of up to 10 years hard labor for 
doctors who perform abortions and offers no exceptions for women 
who wish to abort fetuses that are the product of rape or incest 
the bills sponsors hope to use it to challenge the us supreme 
courts 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion rights 
roemer has 10 days to act and the legislative session ends in 12 
days 
roemer and abortion rights advocates predicted wednesday that 
the legislature would sustain roemers promised veto 
the house passed the final version by a 8023 vote wednesday 
night accepting amendments the senate had added to clarify that 
abortion would be allowed to save the life of the mother 
the senate tuesday passed the bill by 2415 two votes shy of 
the twothirds majority needed to override a veto 
i believe the vote yesterday in the senate showed that there 
will be sufficient votes to sustain the veto but that will be 
their decision roemer said at a news conference 
we have the votes to sustain both in the senate and in the 
house said robin rothrock leader of a coalition of state 
abortionrights groups im feeling great 
rep woody jenkins the bills author met with roemer privately 
for more than an hour wednesday but they failed to reach a 
compromise jenkins said 
wedndesdays house vote and a 7427 vote on a version of the 
bill last week provided margins large enough for an override but 
antiabortion lawmakers have conceded privately that they might not 
be able to carry all those votes to override 
louisiana legislative historians say there is no record of a 
veto being overridden this century 
at his news conference roemer reiterated his opposition to 
abortion on demand and criticized groups who have threatened 
economic boycotts of the state if an antiabortion law is adopted 
in california tuesday the president of the los angeles chapter 
of the national organization for women said the chapter is drafting 
a resolution calling for a boycott of all tourism and conventions 
in louisiana to be considered at nows annual meeting beginning 
friday in san francisco 
these same women criticize others for having narrow 
fundamental views and then i see these kinds of threats i dont 
like it roemer said 
but the governor said louisiana abortion law must have rape and 
incest exceptions 
if we cannot give some credence and faith and hope and 
constructive opportunity to the victims of those crimes then i 
dont think that this bill should be signed by me and will be 
vetoed he said 
jenkins said the exceptions could easily be used by women 
falsely claiming to be rape victims to get a legal abortion 
he also said such exceptions would contradict past louisiana 
abortion law a 19th century measure that included no exceptions 
such inconsistency would weaken the states case should the bill 
reach the supreme court jenkins said 
thats just absolute selfserving foolishness responded 
roemer who said he used to oppose exceptions but changed his mind 
although several states have adopted strict antiabortion laws 
in the past year since the supreme court upheld a restrictive 
missouri abortion law none has attempted to outlaw all abortions 
idahos legislature passed a bill outlawing abortion except in 
some cases of rape incest fetal deformity or a threat to the life 
or health of the woman but that measure was vetoed by gov cecil 
andrus in march 
also in march the us territory of guam approved a law that 
makes it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion and a 
misdemeanor for a woman to have an abortion it makes an exception 
in cases in which the womans life is threatened that law is on 
hold while it is challenged in court 
the us supreme court on monday upheld minnesota and ohio laws 
requiring minors to notify their parents or a judge before having 
an abortion

a university of maryland nuclear 
engineering professor wednesday denied allegations that he sexually 
abused his daughter for more than 16 years 
frank j munno 54 was indicted tuesday by a prince georges 
county grand jury on felony charges after angela mattson told 
authorities her father sexually abused her from the third grade 
through graduate school 
im pleading not guilty because im not guilty munno said 
in a telephone interview from his college park home 
shocked and outraged would be the words to describe the 
feelings im trying to keep inside he said my family is 
supportive and very disappointed 
mattson 28 an engineer with the nuclear regulatory commission 
said she spoke out because she hoped to help other victims of abuse 
ive learned its sometimes easier to explain what happened 
than to keep it a dark secret she told the washington post in 
wednesdays editions 
what im hoping is that theres a potential abuser out there 
whos going to see this and realize that his daughters going to 
grow up to do something press charges she said and maybe he 
wont go into her bedroom 
munno a tenured 89000ayear professor heads the nuclear 
engineering program on the college park campus the largest in the 
university of maryland system he has been at college park for 32 
years 
he said he would not take a leave from his teaching position 
why would i be any worse a teacher because i was accused munno 
said 
the grand jury charged munno with incest child abuse unlawful 
carnal knowledge and unnatural and perverted sex practices he 
faces a maximum of 15 yers in prison if convicted on all the 
charges 
munno is scheduled for arraignment july 13 on the child abuse 
charge authorities said 
mattson said in an interview with wrctv that sending her father 
to prison is not her goal 
i wanted to have my day in court and to have other people in 
my position to realize that they can get better that there is help 
out there she said 
her fathers manipulation prevented her from pressing charges 
sooner she said wednesday 
i couldnt even get up the courage to leave the house she 
said even when i stopped the abuse my father was still able to 
make me feel guilty enough to stay at home and in the last few 
years its been a slowly evolving process one of my own 
strength my own independence 
when asked if she loved her father mattson haltingly replied 
i wish i had a father i have come to the point where i need to 
feel that i dont have a father a father couldnt have done what 
he did and continue treating me the way he is 
in a statement university officials said they cannot take 
action against munno solely on the basis of indictments officials 
will assess the situation when the facts become available 
i think the statement says theyre waiting for the facts 
which is refreshing in this society munno said

exmodel rasheeda moore testified wednesday 
that she used cocaine marijuana and opium with marion barry over 
100 times and that the mayor once told her he was addicted to 
cocaine 
testifying in barrys drug and perjury trial the woman who 
cooperated with the fbi in the mayors arrest said they had a 
sexual relationship and shared drugs between 1986 and 1988 she 
said barry once slapped her to the floor after using drugs 
it was an intimate relationship and we used drugs together 
said moore 
barry watched the 39yearold moore with a stony stare as she 
described their relationship barrys wife effi smiled as moore 
took the witness stand but wore a grim expression as the witness 
detailed allegations of sex and drug use 
moore said barry was an experienced drug user who baked powdered 
cocaine into crack 
after he baked it we smoked it moore testified 
and she said that after smoking crack cocaine in one session 
barry said he was addicted to cocaine he said he wanted to 
quit 
prosecutors were expected to use her testimony to introduce as 
evidence an fbi videotape of the jan 18 night when barry allegedly 
smoked crack cocaine while visiting moore at a washington hotel 
room 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged 
drug use one possession charge stems from the sting in which the 
threeterm mayor was arrested 
moore described an affair that ranged from sex and violence to 
talks of spirituality but which always included drugs she told 
the court she and barry used drugs at least over 100 times 
there were times we would do it more than once a day 
sometimes two or three times a week she continued 
sometimes he would stop by before work sometimes after 
hours moore said 
speaking in a low and even voice moore described how she and 
the mayor used drugs including cocaine powder crack cocaine 
marijuana and opium at a dozen places around washington 
she said barry became violent after one session at a washington 
hotel in which they smoked crack cocaine through a homemade pipe 
barry assembled from aluminum foil and a large spoon the mayor 
accused her of having a relationship with another man and slapped 
me moore said 
she returned the slap she said but ended up on the floor 
when barry slapped her again 
i havent hit a woman in 20 years she said barry told her 
you bring the worst out in a man

powder and smoked it while barrys wife and son were away from the 
house 
moores mothers home she said she and barry smoked crack 
cocaine there several times including dec 22 1988 the day 
barrys visits to the hotel room of convicted drug dealer charles 
lewis were made public barry once smoked so much cocaine in the 
house i had to hold him up afterward he said that was a 
really great hit 
the virginia home of bishop hh brookins the leader of more 
than 300 african methodistepiscopal congregations in the region 
she said she began to pass out there after smoking crack cocaine 
and cried out marion marion but she said the mayor turned 
off the bathroom light and left telling her later i couldnt do 
anything there was nothing i could do 
i could have died she told the court 
the bishop said in statement he had never met ms moore as far 
as he knew and if what she described actually happened it would 
be a violation of the sanctity of my home of my trust and of my 
friendship

to cocaine and talked to me for the first time about developing 
his spiritual side he was tired he wanted to get his life

townhouse where they were using cocaine barry had a series of 
hiding places where he stashed the drug including a vacuum cleaner 
bag moore added

1988 because there was so much drug use over that period of 
time

a focusing flaw that cannot be repaired from 
the ground has been found in the hubble space telescope leaving 
some instruments unworkable until a repair shuttle mission can be 
flown nasa announced wednesday 
many of the spectacular views of the universe that scientists 
hoped to get with the 15 billion hubble instrument will not be 
possible now until a maintenance mission scheduled for 1993 is 
completed officials said 
nasa said it would try to fly the repair mission earlier 
engineers discovered the flaw when they attempted to finetune 
the focus between the primary and the secondary mirrors aboard the 
orbiting telescope 
hubble deputy project manager jean olivier said there was no 
single one pointwith a crisp clean image 
further study determined that there was a fundamental flaw that 
may have been built in when the mirrors were manufactured olivier 
said during a news conference 
jack rehnberg the chief of the space science program at hughes 
danbury optical of danbury conn manufacturer of the flawed 
mirrors said the cause may have been human error during an 
extensive testing program while the mirrors were being made 
we dont know the cause but its probably something 
inherently fundamentally not done right he said it could 
have been a human error 
the mistake he said could have come with equipment that 
checked the polished mirror surface nasa has said that tests 
showed that hubbles 94inch primary mirror is the smoothest large 
mirror ever made 
we could have erred in the assembly of some of the test 
equipment and it didnt get picked up even though weve had lots of 
reviews and checks and rechecks said rehnberg 
the space agency has named lew allen director of the jet 
propulsion laboratory to head a team investigating the hubble 
problem rehnberg said he has selected a team of engineers from his 
company to help 
nasa scientist ed weiler said the problem degrades the focus 
possible with several instruments aboard the orbiting telescope 
particularly two cameras designed to take pictures in visible light 
of very faint and distant stars 
he said a faint object camera provided to the hubble project by 
the european space agency will not be able to take pictures of a 
quality any better than a groundbased telescope 
a wide field camera which was used to take the first photos 
from the hubble released to the public will be virtually useless 
until the telescope can be repaired 
there is no real science we can do with it at this time he 
said 
three instruments that can study stars by gathering ultraviolet 
and infrared radiation will not be as seriously affected weiler 
said but he noted that one of these instruments the high speed 
photometer will be about to collect about half of the science 
that had been planned 
the hubble was placed in a 281mile high orbit by space shuttle 
discovery on april 25 engineers have spent the time since trying 
to finetune the telescope and test its instruments and have 
repeatedly reported problems 
engineers first discovered that a cable not installed properly 
was blocking the rotation of an antenna this was corrected by 
limiting the antenna movement 
later they found that incorrect computer software was causing 
the telescope to point at the wrong places in the sky the software 
was changed 
the experts also discovered that the 25500pound satellite 
developed a vibration that lasted for some minutes each time it 
went from sunrise to sunset and back again in its orbit engineers 
planned to compensate for the vibration with another computer 
program 
but there is no way to fix the focusing flaw from the ground 
said weiler instead he said nasa plans to try to move up a 
scheduled space shuttle maintenance flight to the telescope 
weiler said a replacement widefield camera that had already 
been scheduled for the hubble may be built with special optics that 
would correct the focusing distortion caused by the telescope 
mirrors 
we are pretty optimistic that we can take out all of the 
aberration said weiler 
hubble maintenance flights by the space shuttle were originally 
planned for 1993 1996 and 1997 and weiler said those may be flown 
earlier if replacement instruments that correct the focusing flaw 
can be prepared 
we are not losing science he said we are deferring 
science 
olivier who has been a leader in checking out the telescope 
said that engineers saw a pattern in their tests that had the 
classical characteristic you would expect for a spherical 
aberration where light does not focus at a point as intended 
but over a small volume 
the two mirrors were tested individually on the ground said 
olivier and passed all tests he said they were not tested in 
combination on the ground because this would have required a test 
arrangement that would have cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
before launch the agency said the five instruments aboard would 
detect objects 25 times fainter than the dimmest seen from earth 
and would expand the size of the observable universe by 250 times 
objects in the farthest reaches of the universe some 14 billion 
light years or 82 billion trillion miles away were expected to be 
visible since the universe is thought to be 15 to 20 billion years 
old the telescope would be seeing objects only a short time after 
the socalled big bang that astronomers believe is the origin of 
the universe

judges for the third new york international 
ballet competition were unable to award gold medals when the event 
concluded monday night 
it is the third time the competition has failed to produce 
superior winners no gold was awarded for men in 1984 and none for 
women in 1987 
the basic principle of the competition is that the candidate 
for the gold should exhibit a very wellrounded dance education 
said igor youskevitch artistic director of the competition when 
such a candidate stands out there are no doubts on the part of the 
panel if there is no such clear cut candidate then they can elect 
not to award the gold 
there were however excellent demonstrations by dancers during 
the fiveday event 
at a special awards gala tonight silver medals will be given to 
aidar akhemetov of the soviet union and victor alvarez of spain in 
the mens category and dilana nikiforova of bulgaria in the 
womens category

leaders of the unions striking eastern 
airlines and greyhound lines on tuesday urged organized labor to 
push congress to ban hiring of permanent replacement workers 
workers in the usa have in theory the right to strike but 
they dont have the right to win a strike george kourpias 
international president of the machinists union told the american 
federation of state county and municipal employees convention 
both eastern struck by the machinists on march 4 1989 and 
greyhound struck by its drivers march 2 have continued to operate 
with replacement workers 
companion bills by us rep william clay dmo and sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio would prevent companies from giving 
permanent status to workers hired during a strike the bills are 
pending in committees 
easterns pledge to protect its replacement workers has become a 
major sticking issue between its unions and trustee martin shugrue 
appointed in april to run the airline after creditors lost faith in 
the management led by chairman frank lorenzo 
what im really afraid of is that the trustee appointed is 
talking out of both sides of his mouth kourpias said 
kourpias said that while shugrue made obtaining labor peace a 
priority he protects scabs who have taken our jobs the 
airline needs the experience and dedication of the strikers for 
longterm survival kourpias said 
kourpias said more negotiations are expected this week between 
eastern and its machinists led by district president charles e 
bryan 
were ready to go back to work with a new labor agreement 
kourpias said 
a planned meeting between shugrue and eastern creditors was 
postponed tuesday 
the eastern pilots and flight attendants unions ended sympathy 
walkouts last november but they have expressed frustration that 
eastern has hired back only handfuls of union workers while keeping 
replacement workers 
james lasala president of the amalgamated transit union 
representing greyhound drivers said his union like easterns 
machinists felt they were forced to strike because of 
unionbusting tactics 
no matter what happens in this strike our union will still be 
here lasala said 
but hiring replacement workers who can keep their jobs after 
strikes gives companies an unfair boost in overcoming strikes he 
said 
organized labor should hold accountable politicians who allow 
management to have such unfair advantages lasala said now its 
time for them to show us their support 
richard l trumka president of the united mine workers of 
america gave a stirring call for solidarity and political pressure 
in the 1990s following his unions strike at west virginia last 
year which he said was successful because of the belief that 
working people in this country had finally had enough 
the labor meeting will host south african antiapartheid leader 
nelson mandela on thursday

scientists were dismayed wednesday after 
learning that a problem with the hubble space telescopes mirrors 
will render its cameras almost useless until a space shuttle can be 
sent on a repair mission 
its a major blow to our hopes said kim leschly of the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena it is very disappointing extremely 
disappointing 
david koo an astronomer at the university of california santa 
cruz learned of the telescopes woes when a reporter called 
seeking his reaction 
gee your mom died how do you feel he replied 
koo had planned to analyze the hubbles photographs of random 
patches of the universe to look for unexpected discoveries 
many people were hoping to see new views of the universe now 
well have to wait he said thats very very disappointing 
nasa had planned to make repairs in june 1993 and said it may 
move up that mission 
people arent crying said john holtzman an astronomer at 
lowell observatory in flagstaff ariz its just that there have 
been so many delays in this project that when you say wait another 
three years its slightly depressing 
holtzman was interviewed by phone from a telescope science team 
office near goddard space flight center in maryland 
nasa officials announced wednesday that a manufacturing error 
prevents proper focusing of the 15 billion telescopes mirrors 
they said that until space shuttle astronauts can make repairs 
the problem will make the telescopes most important instrument 
the widefield and planetary camera virtually useless 
the flaw also will make the telescopes second camera which is 
designed to detect faint distant objects unable to take pictures 
any better than those taken by a groundbased telescope three 
other instruments which detect various types of light but arent 
cameras will be less seriously impaired 
the reaction at jet propulsion laboratory which built the 
widefield camera was how come people making the mirror didnt 
do their job right said leschly the cameras systems engineer 
as part of the hubble team you feel disappointed somebody didnt 
do it right and that hurts 
the mirrors and their supports were manufactured by perkinelmer 
corp now hughes danbury optical corp of danbury conn 
company official jack rehnberg said human error may have been to 
blame 
nasa officials in washington said they may correct the problem 
by modifying a secondgeneration widefield camera now under 
construction at the pasadena laboratory the new camera could be 
equipped with special optics to compensate for the focusing flaw 
caused by the faulty mirrors leschly said 
astronauts had been scheduled to replace the existing widefield 
camera with the new camera in june 1993 but nasa indicated it 
would try to fly the repair mission earlier 
there is a path out of this and there still will be images 
from the current camera that will be reasonably exciting but they 
wont push the frontier leschly said adding that the camera 
works flawlessly but is crippled by the mirror problem 
were down for a while but on our way up he said you 
can still see hope at the end of the tunnel

an anonymous caller saying he spoke on 
behalf of colombian guerrillas who allegedly kidnapped scott 
heimdal told a television station wednesday that the american would 
be killed if ransom demands werent met 
the caller a male who spoke with a colombian accent said the 
group holding heimdal a gold miner was the same one that 
kidnapped spanish businessman pablo martin berrocal last august 
the station said 
berrocal was freed in april after his family paid a 1 million 
ransom 
heimdals kidnappers earlier identified themselves as members of 
the peoples liberation army but the anonymous caller said the 
national liberation army was holding heimdal 
diplomatic sources said it was doubtful the national liberation 
army kidnapped heimdal because it operates in northern colombia 
far from the ecuadoran border region where heimdal was captured 
the caller also said iminco the small mining company for which 
heimdal worked received 1 million to be used as ransom but the 
company denied it the caller did not say where the company 
received the money from 
meanwhile the government has ordered iminco to suspend its 
operations the mines owner jeffrey fino said wednesday fino 
said however the company had already suspended its operations 
fino also an american said he did not know the reasons behind 
the suspension which he learned of in a letter received tuesday 
from the ecuadoran institute of mines he said work had stopped at 
the mine when the 27yearold heimdal was kidnapped april 28 
fino said he has not been involved in the negotiations since 
heimdals parents arrived june 18 in quito from peoria ill to 
take charge of efforts to win his release 
a us embassy spokesman refused to comment on either the 
anonymous call or the suspension of finos mining operation 
heimdal was kidnapped as he traveled by boat near the gold 
mining camp where he was in charge of starting river dredging 
operations 
he is reportedly being held in a jungle camp on the colombian 
side of the border 
fino said he suspended mining operations after heimdals 
kidnapping and was selling off his equipment he said the mine 
never reached the production stage 
heimdals kidnappers have asked a ransom of 612000 paid in 
colombian pesos heimdals parents raised about 60000 mostly in 
community donations and that money has been given to the 
guerrillas to assure heimdals safety while negotiations continue 
in washington a government source said on condition of 
anonymity that a meeting is scheduled friday between the kidnappers 
and officials working for heimdals release

lithuanias leaders rushed to moscow on 
wednesday for their second meeting with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev in two days as they tried to come up with a compromise on 
the republics drive for independence 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis and prime minister 
kazimiera prunskiene called gorbachev on wednesday afternoon to 
arrange the meeting it took place a few hours later at gorbachevs 
dacha in the forest outside moscow lithuanian parliament 
spokeswoman rita dapkus said 
lithuanias supreme council or parliament was scheduled to 
begin debating the proposed compromise thursday morning it calls 
for a threemonth moratorium on the republics march 11 declaration 
of independence that would take effect when the soviet union opened 
negotiations said lithuanian government spokesman ceslovas 
jursenas 
the proposal also says the moratorium would cease if the 
lithuanian government becomes unable to perform its duties 
jursenas said 
at the meeting gorbachev reiterated that lithuania must freeze 
its declaration of independence before he would end crippling 
economic sanctions and begin negotiations ms dapkus said 
oil supplies most natural gas and many raw materials and 
manufactured goods have been cut off since midapril when the 
kremlin imposed the embargo to pressure lithuania to rescind its 
independence declaration the blockade has put nearly 50000 people 
out of work among the republics 11 million workers 
gorbachev did not mention his earlier insistence that lithuania 
abide by the law on secession passed by the soviet parliament 
earlier this year said ms dapkus 
lithuanians say the secession law imposes conditions that make 
it impossible for a republic to leave the soviet union the law 
makes secession illegal without a republicwide referendum 
approval by the soviet parliament and a transition period of up to 
five years 
ms dapkus said gorbachev urged the lithuanian parliament to 
take action quickly on the proposed compromise 
gorbachev gave no reason for the urgency she said 
but a critical soviet communist party congress is set to open 
monday and the expected showdown between reformers and hardliners 
could affect gorbachevs political situation 
lithuanian officials also are facing a critical point due to the 
increasingly severe effects of the kremlins economic blockade 
lithuanian government officials said wednesday that they do not 
have enough fuel to begin the grain harvest which should start 
next week they said they soon would have to restrict fuel 
elsewhere and begin cutting back on hot water supplies to homes 
the official soviet news agency tass quoted a lithuanian 
spokesman in moscow virgilius savitskas as saying that during the 
90minute meeting with gorbachev the lithuanian officials were 
searching for a reasonable compromise with gorbachev over the 
republics independence declaration 
tass in its report wednesday night said negotiations could be 
held only if lithuania declares a moratorium and suspends the act 
of march 11 for a period of talks 
it was the second meeting in as many days between lithuanian 
leaders and gorbachev as a divided lithuanian parliament and 
society prepared for the parliamentary debate 
the lithuanian delegation left moscow immediately after the 
talks ended and headed back to vilnius the lithuanian capital on 
a special flight said officials of the republics mission in 
moscow 
accompanying landsbergis and mrs prunskiene were deputy prime 
minister romualdas ozolas legislative leader egidius bickauskas 
and two other lawmakers 
gorbachev met with landsbergis on tuesday morning and spoke with 
mrs prunskiene by telephone two hours later 
ms dapkus said wednesdays meeting carried more weight because 
it also involved soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov soviet 
parliamentary chairman anatoly lukyanov and gorbachevs close 
adviser politburo member alexander yakovlev 
at the meeting gorbachev that if lithuania freezes its 
independence declaration the republic could either negotiate 
directly with the soviet government or participate in planned 
negotiations on a new union treaty that would link the 15 soviet 
republics in a looser structure ms dapkus said 
gorbachev urged lithuania to take part in the intersoviet 
treaty ms dapkus said 
gorbachev aides have described this newlook union as anything 
from a federation like the united states to a confederation like 
the european community which allies independent countries 
lithuanian officials said privately a sharp debate was going on 
in the republic on how their drive for independence would be 
affected by the upcoming communist party congress and its effect on 
gorbachevs power 
the lithuanians indicated they do not know if they should accept 
the compromise while gorbachev is strong enough to offer it or 
hold out for possible victory by reformers who support the 
republics right to independence 
lithuania was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
along with the baltic republics of latvia and estonia those 
republics have also declared they want to regain their 
independence but have taken a slower approach than lithuania

a bill to require a sevenday waiting period 
for the purchase of a handgun from a gun dealer was approved 
tuesday by a house subcommittee 
on a 64 vote the house judiciary committees subcommittee on 
crime approved the brady bill named after james s brady 
former president reagans press secretary who was shot in a march 
1981 assassination attempt on reagan 
brady watched the proceeding from a wheelchair as the panel 
defeated on a 55 tie vote an amendment by rep bill mccollum 
rfla to instead require states to toughen socalled 
pointofpurchase identification procedures for handgun 
purchases 
mccollums measure which was supported by the national rifle 
association would still have allowed a handgun buyer to take 
immediate possession of the weapon after five years the amendment 
would have required states to include fingerprints on drivers 
licenses as an identification system for handgun purchases 
the subcommittees chairman rep william j hughes dnj 
called the amendment just another attempt to dismember the brady 
bill 
i agree its inconvenient to wait but were attempting to 
do something about the carnage that takes place every day hughes 
said citing the 30000 victims of handgun violence since the house 
struck the brady measure from a dru bill in 1988 
a similar bill has been introduced in the senate but has not 
been acted on 
but the senate last month in a 5248 vote approved curbing 
nine types of rapidfire assault weapons over the nras objections 
as part of a crime bill later though nra supporters led an 
effort to thwart speedy action on the bill and it remains stalled 
bradys wife sarah who with her husband now lobbies congress 
on behalf of guncontrol measures said the combination of the two 
votes demonstrates that more lawmakers are choosing police and 
public safety over the special interest gun lobby 
congress need not be held in a stranglehold by the extremist 
leaders at the national rifle association she said

contra commanders on 
wednesday surrendered their weapons to president violeta barrios de 
chamorro in a ceremony hailing the end of a nineyear civil war 
that left 30000 people dead 
today the war ends presidential spokesman danilo lacayo 
said 
mrs chamorro accepted the weapons from 100 top rebel commanders 
led by israel galeano in san pedro de lovago 100 miles east of the 
capital 
meanwhile shortly after the ceremony two helicopters carying 
about 24 journalists collided as they were taking off and at least 
14 people were injured according to reports the journalists 
aboard included photographers for the associated press and agence 
francepresse 
in a speech mrs chamorro promised to disarm the leftist 
sandinistas who led the government for 11 years there have been 
charges the sandinistas distributed weapons among their supporters 
before leaving office on april 25 
were going to disarm everyone peacefully without hate and 
without resentment mrs chamorro said adding that she would ask 
local officials nationwide to tell me in writing where 
sandinista arms caches were hidden 
the contras cited the alleged arming of the civilian population 
when they missed several deadlines to disarm 
galeano speaking during the ceremony said it is an honor to 
say to the nicaraguan people mission accomplished the struggle 
has been to establish a government of laws in this country 
troops from an international demobilization force used 
blowtorches to destroy the weapons on the spot 
i feel proud and happy as a nicaraguan woman and mother 
because the boys have turned over their arms so nicaragua can live 
in peace mrs chamorro said 
the weapons included automatic rifles and a second batch of 
surfacetoair missiles on tuesday galeano handed over 62 of the 
usmade red eye missiles to the head of the united nations force 
that has overseen the demobilization of more than 18000 contras 
gen agustin quesada 
we hope this signifies that peace will endure in nicaragua 
galeano told the spanish general 
the former sandinista government led by daniel ortega lost a 
feb 25 election to the conservative coaltion led by mrs chamorro 
about 30000 people died and another 25000 were wounded in the 
war between the usbacked rebels and the sandinistas in 
nicaragua a nation the size of iowa with 36 million residents 
galeano insisted the contras were never tools of us policy as 
many charged and said they arose as a peasant reaction to 
sandinista attempts to impose foreign totalitarian and 
expansionist ideologies on nicaragua 
he gave up the first set of missiles in el amendro a town 190 
miles southeast of managua in rio san juan province where the 
contras have been promised land and a degree of local autonomy 
galeano said the united states had given the contras more than 
100 of the missiles the last four years of the war he claimed the 
rebels downed 35 government aircraft with them 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo who has played a key role in 
persuading the rebels to lay down their arms celebrated a mass 
marking the wars end he said peace depends on putting aside the 
language of hate and vengeance 
diplomats from the united states which armed the contras early 
in the reagan administration and from the soviet union which 
armed the sandinistas they tried to overthrow were invited to 
wednesdays ceremony lacayo said 
the rebels began disarming on may 8 and un officials say 
about 1000 still have their weapons 
the elections were held under a regional peace accord that 
called for the contras to disarm 
the war along with the harsh us economic sanctions that 
contributed to bringing the nicaraguan economy to a virtual 
standstill were thought the key factors behind the sandinistas 
defeat 
washington lifted the economic embargo after mrs chamorros 
victory and sent nicaragua 300 million in needed foreign aid

a large area in the wooded 
mountains of northern yugoslavia was a forbidden zone for 40 
years with the erosion of communist power the people finally are 
learning why 
an underground warren was built in the mountains to protect the 
communist party elite of the slovenian republic from any disaster 
ranging from nuclear war to insurrection 
thousands of political prisoners are said to have built the 
shelter in the heart of a heavily guarded 56squaremile area 40 
miles south of ljubljana capital of slovenia 
on a tour organized by slovenias new noncommunist government 
journalists were taken through police roadblocks to a mountain that 
has been transformed into a wellconcealed maze of tunnels 
galleries and shafts 
igor bavcar the slovenian interior minister said the 
government in ljubljana has been told similar shelters were built 
by the other five republics he expressed confidence that as 
democracy spreads the veil of secrecy will be lifted from all of 
them 
the 3000squareyard facility in slovenia could accommodate 
at least 100 people and if the need arose probably several 
hundred more said marko kadunc an engineer employed there since 
1961 he said stocks of fuel food and water were sufficient for 
several months 
slovenia and croatia the westernmost of yugoslavias republics 
are ruled by centerright parties that defeated reform communists 
in the first multiparty elections since world war ii 
all the other republics except the largest serbia have 
scheduled multiparty elections and free federal elections are 
expected in the fall 
soon after taking office slovenias new government formed a 
commission to investigate the guarded zone and determine whether 
political prisoners helped build it 
welllighted corridors wind through the mountain past dozens of 
bedrooms a kitchen and conference rooms there are a small 
infirmary and a fully equipped operating room 
small oval steel doors like submarine hatches subdivide the 
underground area and entry is through a decontamination room 
this place was designed to survive a nuclear war said kadunc 
the engineer 
the complex was finished in the mid1960s used for occasional 
training exercises and gradually mothballed after 1978 more than 
400 employees remained to maintain the shelter and run a large 
cattle farm and logging operation inside the restricted zone 
an intelligence report published june 20 by the daily borba in 
belgrade said german prisoners of war started the work on the 
shelter and yugoslav prisoners took over after the pows were freed 
in the early 1950s 
political prisoners and captured officers of various armed 
groups that fought the communists in world war ii blasted the 
tunnels in the mountain the report said 
the zone is just a few miles from kocevski rog a mountain where 
up to 15000 anticommunist fighters who surrendered were executed 
when the war ended in 1945 
anyone who worked on the shelter got a 20year prison sentence 
and was earmarked for gradual liquidation in order to safeguard 
the secrecy of the forbidden zone said the intelligence report 
which was confidential until borba published it 
kadunc said no political prisoners had worked at the site since 
he started there in 1961 and he had not heard of any being used 
before that 
only free slovenian workers with a good moral profile worked 
here he said 
slovenian government officials said the zone would not be opened 
to the public before the end of 1990 to allow time for removal of 
stored ammunition and other explosives

galang indonesia ap more than 16000 refugees from 
indochina have been crowded onto this 63squaremile island 
turning it into a noxious fetid marsh and 100 new ones arrive 
every day 
the island in the riau chain near singapore was opened as a 
refugee camp in 1979 to house no more than 60008000 people with 
firm commitments to be resettled in third countries 
lt col doekseno told 24 journalists during the first official 
tour of galang since 1984 that the number of refugees on the 
island had risen from fewer than 2000 in march 1989 to 16800 
cramped squalid conditions have created serious threats of 
disease and death said doekseno one of the senior officials who 
run the island jointly with the office of un high commissioner 
for refugees 
garbage and dirty water from patched bathrooms and kitchens have 
turned the camp areas where refugees live in barracks and 
makeshift tents into stinking swamps 
a water shortage and the steadily increasing camp population 
have forced authorities on galang to cut the water ration from 20 
liters a day per person to seven the weekly food allowance per 
refugee is 25 kilograms of rice about 5 pounfs and two cans of 
sardines 
indonesias problem is compounded by a new flow of boat 
people from cambodia who began arriving in february and now 
total more than 1500 
at least seven boatloads of cambodians bound for australia have 
landed in indonesia since may doekseno said some were sent to 
galang and others continued on their way after being given food and 
fuel he said 
indonesia does not recognize the cambodians as refugees and 
treats them differently at the galang camps doekseno said they 
were classified as displaced persons in order to qualify them 
for some help from the un refugee agency 
foreign minister ali alatas described them as economic 
migrants who should be repatriated 
indonesian officials said the cambodians left home with 
australia as their clear destination carrying money and traveling 
in good boats doekseno denied claims by australia that indonesia 
refuses to let cambodians land and said we accept them on 
humanitarian grounds 
cambodians on galang have built their own village on a hill 
they tried to make homes similar to those they left behind using 
palm fronds mud and whatever other building materials the island 
offered 
long rithida 23 a said she left her mother behind in cambodia 
and was trying to reach relatives in australia or canada 
i dont want to go back to cambodia she said my uncle is 
in canada and my aunt is in australia i want to live in a free 
country 
she arrived feb 22 in a boat with 81 other cambodians 
australia concerned about the increasing flow of boat people 
wants indonesia to continue its role as a country of first asylum 
where refugees are screened and sent to their countries of final 
settlement the united states australia and european nations 
indonesia says it will do so but foreign minister alatas has 
criticised what he calls the slow selective processing of refugees 
for resettlement 
in april australia provided 15 million 116 milion us to 
help the un refugee agency improve the galang facilities 
including sanitation and a survey to locate more water

the christian shepherd of the east ecumenical 
patriarch dimitrios i next week begins a monthlong and 
unprecedented visit in the west with us church flocks 
a journey of love and unity he has called it 
its the first trip to this continent in history by a presiding 
spiritual leader of the 250 million eastern orthodox believers 
around the world about 7 million of them in the united states 
hes to take part in washington in a layclergy congress of the 
greek orthodox church led by archbishop iakovos meet with 
president bush and visit 10 other cities conferring with church 
leaders 
he seeks to further ecumenical rapprochement and to 
contribute to the cause of justice friendship and peace in the 
world iakovos said in an interview iakovos is deputy for the 
patriarch in the western hemisphere 
although eastern orthodoxy may seem unfamiliar to some 
westerners it wielded a powerful influence in the formative years 
of christianity and remains its principal flock in eastern europe 
it also has become a robust force in the americas and spurred 
by iakovos a vigorous participant in the ecumenical movement for 
christian unity has added a special dimension to it 
the ecumenical patriarch bishop of ancient constantinople now 
istanbul turkey holds a post in eastern orthodoxy somewhat 
similar to that of the pope the bishop of rome in roman 
catholicism 
however while the pope has direct juridical authority 
throughout that church the patriarch relies on intangible 
spiritual sway over mostly selfgoverning orthodox churches of 
various national origins 
he is considered primus inter pares first among equals of 
eastern orthodox patriarchs and bishops the 269th successor in an 
office traced back to the apostle andrew the papacy traces its 
orgins to the apostle peter 
eastern orthodox churches whether of greek russian bulgarian 
romanian or other cultural backgrounds have similar liturgies and 
hold the same doctrines based on undivided christianitys first 
seven ecumenical councils 
a central affirmation of faith is the nicene creed of 381 ad 
also commonly used in western churches of protestantism and roman 
catholicism 
despite basic unity however orthodoxy remains divided in this 
country into a dozen branches stemming from various national 
backgrounds yet all looking to dimitrios as preeminent spiritual 
guide 
metropolitan theodosius head of the russianderived orthodox 
church in america expressed hope the patriarchs visit will bring 
us orthodox groups into greater unity and harmony 
he personifies unity of all orthodox throughout the world 
theodosius said in a telephone interview we are hoping he will 
bring us closer to the full integration that we are looking for in 
our common efforts 
the millionmember oca is the second largest orthodox body in 
this country next to greek orthodoxy which numbers two million 
dimitrios a quiet unassuming man of 75 was born sept 8 
1914 in constantinople the new rome of the ancient byzantine 
empire which under turkish rule was renamed istanbul in 1930 
he served churches in greece turkey and iran and in 1972 was 
elected ecumenical patriarch succeeding athenagorus i an 
eloquent americanseasoned prelate 
the more reserved dimitrios initially stuck close to the 
patriarchate the sometimes harassed and restricted headquarters in 
heavily moslem turkey but lately has ventured among his flock 
around the world 
in 1987 he visited the soviet union conferring with prelates 
there including the late russian orthodox patriarch pimen 
succeeded in early june by patriarch alexi ii the visit was the 
first since 1589 
dimitrios also visited orthodox leaders in greece yugoslavia 
romania and poland and bulgaria and pope john paul ii at the 
vatican the world council of churches in geneva and archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie in london 
until the mid20th century eastern orthodoxy had been isolated 
from western christianity for more than nine centuries since a 1054 
split between orthodoxy and roman catholicism 
at that time constantinoples patriarch and romes pope 
excommunicated each other 
but that prolonged rigid eastwest rift was healed when the 
late patriarch athenagorus and pope paul vi met and embraced in 
jerusalem in 1964 afterward the mutual excommunications were 
lifted 
eastern orthodoxy earlier in 1961 had joined the world council 
of churches previously made up mostly of western protestant 
denominations 
dimitrios whose office retains administrative ties with some 
orthodox bodies such as the large greek orthodox church of the 
americas has no such formal oversight of indepedent or 
autocephalous branches 
but he plans meetings with their leaders including those of the 
second largest us orthodox body the oca whose roots go back to 
the late 1700s in alaska before russia sold alaska to the united 
states in 1867 
most us orthodox churches arose through immigration of the 
late 19th and 20th centuries 
arriving in washington july 2 dimitrios spends 10 days there 
before visits in new york city hempstead n y allentown and 
johnstown pa san francisco chicago buffalo and niagara falls 
ny and boston

given the opportunity even presidents and 
prime ministers sometimes cut economics theyd rather spend their 
time talking about international politics strategy and military 
matters says an economist who has watched them do it at economic 
summit meetings 
so w allen wallis a former undersecretary of state for 
economic affairs says the seven leaders at the economic summit in 
houston next month will stick to designated subjects at the formal 
meetings and switch to their own agendas in more relaxed private 
settings 
after all theyre the bosses four prime ministers two 
presidents and one chancellor no professorial economists are going 
to make them deal with a steady diet of the dismal science 
most of them arent really very interested in economics anyhow 
wallis said 
at houston july 9 to 11 theyll probably spend their private 
sessions discussing and trying to translate the soviet communist 
party conference that convenes 10 days before they do in sessions 
that could be crucial to the future of mikhail s gorbachev and his 
programs 
theyll also be talking about progress toward reunification in 
germany and about the risk of deunification in canada where the 
frenchcanadians of quebec are threatening succession 
the houston conference will be the 16th economic summit meeting 
and like those that went before it is not likely to produce drama 
or major decisions off past performance chances are it will be 
dull especially when sticking to business 
summit staff veterans agree that the annual meetings are useful 
for the contacts conversation and agendasetting but they seldom 
decide anything and the final communiques usually are worded to 
paper over the most nettlesome issues 
the summits began in 1975 when the leaders of france and west 
germany who had conferred while serving as finance ministers 
invited the heads of other western industrial democracies and japan 
to join for an economic conference at the top 
those meetings were supposed to be informal but that doesnt 
work with heads of governments they have their own protocol and 
their own lingo each of the seven delegations eight counting the 
european economic community is entitled to 15 members all 
expenses paid by the host country 
each government head has a personal representative for the 
summit a role wallis filled six times for president reagan in 
economic summitspeak the representatives are called sherpas 
because like himalayan mountain guides they plan and preview the 
route to the summit those top summit aides hold four formal 
minisummits of their own in advance of the main event 
at a briefing at the american enterprise institute for public 
policy research a panel of economists who have been involved in 
prior summits looked toward the one just ahead 
they agreed that trade barriers especially on agricultural 
products need discussion at the summit and that the altered state 
of eastwest relations also should be a prime summit topic 
by the time they get to houston the western heads of state may 
be showing traces of summit fatigue they meet a week earlier at 
london for a nato summit 
the quest for a new international trade agreement by the end of 
the year is a priority for the bush administration as the summit 
host president bush is first among equals in influence at such 
sessions and his agenda would customarily be followed 
but robert j morris another former summit planner said french 
president francois mitterrand may have a different idea 
morris now senior vice president of the us council for 
international business said the french leader takes almost glee 
in spiking the summits that are hosted by american presidents 
this time he said mitterrand wants the summit to consider 
western aid to the soviet union a notion the administration 
considers premature at best 
the houston meetings arent likely to change minds on that or 
produce deals on much else 
economic summits are not and should not be occasions for 
explicit agreements or formal actions wallis said in an 
appraisal to be published by the institute they should be 
occasions for heads of government to converse candidly with their 
peers at home remember they have no peers

there was a time when the atlanta zoo was 
regarded as a kind of animal concentration camp a place where one 
keeper ate rabbits from the petting zoo and where other beasts 
lived and died unnaturally 
but that was before zoo director terry maple came along with his 
imagination and enthusiasm and organizational skills six years 
later and halfway through a 50 million renovation the atlanta zoo 
is a respected model in the zoological world and terry maple is a 
very tired man 
this zoo has been enormously difficult to build it has taxed 
me in every imaginable way it has taken every ounce of energy ive 
had says maple 43 
willie b probably does not appreciate the effort though he has 
benefited the popular lowland gorilla named after former atlanta 
mayor william b hartsfield lived alone in a cage for 27 years 
now he lives outside in a lush junglelike habitat 
there are new displays of flamingos and rhinos a masai mara 
exhibit for giraffes lions and elephants a replica of the 
indonesian rain forest for orangutans a sheba sumatran tiger 
forest where tigers will be bred under the auspices of the 
american association of zoological parks and aquariums 
we opened those exhibits fast and furious we recovered faster 
than any zoo ever recovered and the pace was painful maple said 
but the growth spurt was not as painful as the zoos situation 
when maple came aboard parade magazine had rated the zoo as among 
the nations 10 worst only 10000 was budgeted each year for zoo 
maintenance 
a 15yearold zoo elephant named twinkles died while on loan to 
a traveling circus in north carolina in addition to the rabbits 
that fell victim to the keepers appetite at least eight other zoo 
animals perished including a baboon whose decapitated body was 
found in a dump truck 
the name was changed to zoo atlanta but maple and his staff 
envisioned more than semantic changes they wanted to build a firm 
foundation of support 
membership in friends of zoo atlanta has swelled from 5000 to 
just over 53000 making it fifth largest among nonprofit zoo 
support groups in the country said cheryl moody director of 
membership 
attendance has increased from about 260000 in 1984 to a 
projected 983870 this year though adult ticket prices have 
climbed from 250 to 675 
the annual budget less than 1 million in 1984 is 77 million 
this year the staff has nearly tripled from 40 to 115 
the zoo which ended 1989 with a 48000 deficit is on the 
verge of operating in the black said business manager dennis 
baker this years goal is to create a 500000 surplus to help the 
zoo through the lean winter months 
all this requires the kind of showmanship that has become a fact 
of life for modern zoos recent promotions for zoo atlanta included 
fathers day at the zoo the chance to adopt a lovebird on 
valentines day and a summer beach party in february billed as 
the zoo atlanta beach bash 
the zoos progress has not gone unnoticed it has regained its 
membership in the aazpa and has been widely applauded by zoo 
professionals 
terry maple is a natural leader and he has an incredible 
commitment to wildlife and wild places said robert wagner 
executive director of the aazpa he has brought those things as 
well as his incredible enthusiasm to zoo atlanta and all have just 
fallen into place behind him 
llewellyn haden chairman of the zoos governing board said 
he in many ways is the zoo 
but maple a psychology professor at the georgia institute of 
technology who had served as deputy director and curator of the 
audubon zoo in new orleans says his tenure is something of an 
accident 
he had intended to stay three months he said but i got 
sidetracked into building a local zoo now he is considering a 
return to academic life where he would have time for his family 
and time to write a book on his experiences 
i am not writing my resignation he said i am totally 
committed to this place the question is can the old zoo director 
squeak out a book somehow and still be zoo director there are not 
enough hours in the day 
but in the same breath maple also talks of the challenges that 
lie ahead for the zoo there are financial challenges and 
promotional challenges and then there are the bear exhibits an 
embarrassment he said 
its strictly an animal welfare issue maple said theyre 
one of the last vestiges of the old zoo its hard to accept that 
they exist

the late fred allen once described a radio 
network executive as a man in charge of turning molehills into 
mountains 
in television they do it in reverse 
the wizard of oz is coming to television this fall as a 
saturday morning cartoon look whos talking will debut on the 
small screen as baby talk with tony danza providing the babys 
grownup voice 
television apparently has no qualms about ripping off the film 
industry heck tv will even make an entire series from a song 
remember harper valley pta not the one on the radio sung by 
jeannie c riley the one on nbc starring barbara eden 
this cloning of sorts has been going on for at least a decade 
but this season the trend has reached new proportions as network 
executives raid the big screen with a vengeance 
there are nearly a dozen shows on the big three fall schedules 
that come directly from film this might lead a normal person to 
assume these hybrids fare well with television audiences 
they dont 
most of them fail some of them embarrassingly tales of the 
gold monkey an unabashed ripoff of indiana jones lasted one 
season on abc in 1982 
that was nothing however compared to the rush by all three 
networks to imitate the raunchy success of animal house in 1979 
cbs coed fever lasted one episode nbcs brothers and 
sisters ran for 2 months delta house on abc made it for 
three months before getting the hook 
the undisputed success story in this evergrowing genre of 
television is mash whose finale was the mostwatched 
telecast in tv history the odd couple was successful on abc 
and ran for five seasons but nothing has ever come close to 
duplicating the 11year success of mash 
if movies dont translate well into tv why do network 
executives continue to do it 
well they say television is a crap shoot period might as 
well try something already familiar to viewing audiences 
take cbs for example bagdad cafe a spring series has 
been renewed for fall uncle buck taken from john candys 
slapstick gross comedy film is a new fall show big is in the 
spring line up bill and teds excellent adventure will become 
a saturday morning kid show come september 
although the failure rate is very high said peter 
tortorici senior vice president for cbs planning and scheduling 
in the game that we play in network television the failure rate 
for everything is very high eighty to 90 percent of everything you 
try doesnt work 
other past cbs efforts have included house calls 1979 to 
1982 private benjamin 1981 to 1983 seven brides for 
seven brothers one season and bad news bears two seasons 
at nbc this year working girl was fired although it will 
play through the summer last years baby boom starring kate 
jackson in diane keatons film role likewise didnt pass probation 
and was canceled in 1981 walking tall starring bo svenson as 
sheriff buford pusser lasted six months 
they dont succeed for the same reasons that other shows 
dont said nbc senior vice president of series perry simon 
either the writing isnt good or the chemistry between the 
characters isnt enough 
the trick to this simon said is to be able to 
distinguish between a feature film and how it will translate into a 
television series 
meaning the movie must provide enough fodder for a weekly show 
and the actors who often must fill the shoes of boxoffice stars 
must be able to make the role their own 
currently nbc has just about the only successful 
filmturnedtelevision series in the heat of the night 
starring carroll oconnor and howard rollins in the roles created 
by rod steiger and sidney poitier has become a sure bet for the 
peacock network 
abc has not been fond of turning films into tv shows said stu 
bloomberg executive vice president for primetime 
ive actually shied away from them bloomberg said this 
is the first year that were doing them 
well not really abc did delta house remember and 
breaking away in 1980 and 9 to 5 in 1982 all of them 
ratings losers 
abc has baby talk in the fall on the spring schedule for 
next year is true believer starring treat williams in the role 
played on the big screen by james woods 
the feature film makes such an impression its hard to get 
people to star in a television version bloomberg said no one 
wants to be the television tom hanks 
hanks role in big by the way has yet to be cast by cbs

native people of the north are 
preparing to take on the antifur movement not on the tundra but 
in the marketplace 
two native groups in alaska and canada plan to seek out small 
markets to sell nativetrapped andsewn fur clothing but animal 
rights activists contend the embryonic plans are doomed and 
promise to oppose the products as much as they do furs from 
nonnative trappers and marketers 
we have no problems with native subsistence wildlife killing 
as long as its done as humanely as possible said michael 
osullivan spokesman for the world society for the protection of 
animals in toronto 
but we cannot accept commercial fur sales its not who 
carries out the activity but the activity itself he said 
alaskas athabascan indians and the inuit eskimos of canada 
retort that the animal protectionists appear to care little about 
the human suffering caused by native unemployment or about the 
survival of native cultures 
and antifur activists they say would open the door to other 
forms of development that would be far more threatening to the 
environment and animals 
their anger at the antifur forces has simmered for years but 
it was just three years ago that they formed indigenous survival 
international a militant native group that spans alaska canada 
and greenland 
the marketing strategy was the groups idea 
if all goes according to plan alaska athabascans through their 
yukon flats fur cooperative soon will seek markets in the united 
states and europe for furs labeled authentic native design 
they hope to sell through small stores preferably owned by 
natives they envision consumers who will buy their coats hats 
boots and other articles more for their native artistry than for 
reasons of fashion 
the plan was forged after the cooperative sold just 150000 
worth of furs in the past two years that small return has 
endangered the cooperative because banks refuse to loan it money 
said clarence alexander the athabascan chief for the village of 
fort yukon 
alexander an indigenous survival international member said his 
people hoped to generate the modest amounts of cash they need to 
supplement a subsistence economy based mostly on hunting trapping 
fishing and gathering 
subsistence societies like the athabascans and the inuit need 
a little cash to buy gas for boats to heat with oil to buy 
ammunition said robert higgins a spokesman for the canadian 
inuits umbrella organization inuit tapirisat in ottawa 
fur sales are their only ready source of cash he said 
the organization wants to revive the harvest of adult ringed 
seals as a way of returning canadas 28000 inuit to a subsistence 
economy higgins said 
their sealingbased culture was devastated by a powerful 
antisealing movement that caught on in 1983 the impetus was 
photographs grisly pictures of nonnative sealers clubbing harp 
seal pups to death off newfoundland 
higgins said his group primarily wants to replace the inuits 
storebought food and clothing with seal meat and fur but the 
inuit also will sell nativemade fur clothing to raise cash he 
said 
antifur advocates accept native peoples need to trap and shoot 
animals for their own needs said pat ragan the program director 
of wildlife for the humane society of the united states in 
washington dc 
but to kill animals to market skins is another thing 
altogether she said the only hope for these people is to get 
away from marketing furs we acknowledge that there are problems 
with that but i dont think selling furs is the way to solve 
them 
her group offers no alternatives to the native fur trade of 
course we dont have an official position on that she said 
our job is protecting animals 
tom morse an anchorage antifur activist said natives wouldnt 
need cash if they would return completely to the old ways they 
were heating their homes before the white man brought oil and 
snaring animals before white trappers introduced the steel leghold 
trap he said 
they have the freedom to follow their own lifestyle but when 
they start combining cultures the results have been disastrous 
said morse a physics instructor at the university of alaska in 
anchorage 
alexander reacted angrily to that logic 
some of us would like to return completely to the old ways 
but the presence of nonnatives and their competition for resources 
makes that impossible the athabascan leader said 
we have always been and still are a noncash society but we 
are forced now to need some cash alexander said northern 
natives he said could reject western tools such as outboard 
engines guns and heating oil only if morse and the nonnative 
populations left 
in destroying the native fur trade native leaders say the 
antifur movement is laying the groundwork for destruction of 
animal habitat 
they point to the pribilof islands where the aleuts hunted 
seals for centuries then congress ended the harvest in 1985 
limiting the killings to those used for food and the federal 
government withdrew subsidies for the aleuts 
literally overnight we had human suffering suicides more 
than 100 documented attempted suicides massive anxiety and a 
200percent increase in the cost of groceries from the loss of the 
subsidies said larry merculieff a leader of the aleut islanders 
and commissioner of the state department of commerce and economic 
development 
the state stepped in and poured millions of dollars into 
development of a major port at saint paul island one of two in the 
pribilofs for the thriving bering sea fishery merculieff noted 
but that could have other consequences 
saint paul soon will be opening its fishing port he said 
we will then have 2000 transients on an island that is five 
miles wide 12 miles long with a million seals three million 
birds and 700 aleuts the people being brought in are not sensitive 
to village life or wildlife the disruption wont be confined to 
the environment but to our social and cultural structure as well 
the state commerce chief is not optimistic about the native 
marketing plan 
it might work for five years or so but in the long run the 
fur markets of the world are going to be completely destroyed by 
the animal rights movement 
the effect on native cultures to me merculieff said is 
tantamount to genocide but nobody seems to be listening

with cold wars thawing everywhere even 
americas two longfeuding teacher unions are talking peace 
the rival american federation of teachers and national education 
association lately have been aiming not at each other but at the 
bush administration and the nations governors for failing to 
advance muchheralded national education goals announced in 
february 
whats so frustrating said nea president keith geiger is 
that over the last six months weve heard how we have to allocate 
50 billion to bail out savings and loans but i find it 
interesting that nobody said we have to allocate another 74 
billion so we could fully fund head start i thought the education 
crisis was every bit as deep as the savings and loan crisis 
obviously it wasnt 
such criticisms likely will set the tone when delegates of the 
750000member aft meet in boston beginning monday and the 2 
millionmember nea gathers in kansas city later this week 
in separate interviews at their washington headquarters aft 
president albert shanker and nea chief geiger said they intend to 
challenge the president governors and other politicians to match 
their nice words about education with deeds and dollars 
each also said their unions have found more common ground than 
at any time in their history 
both shanker and geiger say they have quietly developed a 
personal and professional relationship unimaginable a few years 
ago they make it a point to eat lunch together at washingtons 
trendy i ricci restaurant to talk over educational and union issues 
the cold wars over here too shanker said keith geiger 
and i get along well personally thats a relationship that hasnt 
been there for a long time 
shanker 62 said he even dreams of putting the two unions on 
the path to merger before he retires some day as president 
the aft and nea are two unions that have bucked the trend of a 
decline in the union movement he said instead of competing 
against each other we should figure out how to pull together 
people who are in educational functions in american industry you 
could have a new american labor movmenent based on information and 
professional workers 
but neither merger nor shankers retirement appear imminent 
hes running for a ninth twoyear term as president at his 
convention and no one doubts the outcome 
geiger midway through his first twoyear term as head of the 
nations largest teacher union said his keynote address will deal 
with the bush administrations failure to promote the six national 
goals that grew out of last falls historic charlottesville va 
education summit with the nations 50 governors 
one goal dealt with early childhood education nea delegates 
will consider a proposal calling on public schools to become 
principal providers of services to preschoolers a draft of the 
proposal estimated that only 30 percent of the nations 161 
million children under age 5 are served by day care nursery 
schools or other programs 
among the more controversial initiatives facing nea delegates 
could be a report giving qualified support to alternative routes to 
licensing teachers a notion the union historically has resisted 
some 48 states many facing teacher shortages have adopted 
various forms of alternative certification as a way of luring 
people into teaching without requiring many hours of college 
teacher training 
geiger himself also could be an issue at the convention which 
runs thursday through sunday 
his leadership style will be on display when he addresses some 
8000 convention delegates for the first time since assuming the 
presidency last summer from mary hatwood futrell arguably the most 
beloved and effective nea leader ever 
futrell gained national prominence for nudging an often 
reluctant nea into accepting such reform ideas as a national 
professional standards board for teachers 
geiger isnt expected to depart much from futrells reform 
policies but he cited one difference with his predecessor 
i have a background in both collective bargaining and 
political action thats deeper than any other president the 
association has ever had im not afraid to talk a reform idea into 
a contract ive done it 
if the aft gathering follows its usual form nothing is likely 
to happen that goes against the wishes of al the teachers pal 
this years convention will celebrate the end of the cold war in 
europe and highlight the afts growing role in exporting us 
educational practices to east bloc nations shanker said 
jan urban a former czech teacher instrumental in engineering 
the election of reform president vaclav havel will address the 
conventiondelegations of teachers and former teachers from 
czechoslovakia bulgaria hungary poland and romania also will 
attend 
i think the whole celebration of the end of the cold war is 
especially important to the aft said shanker a lot of 
educational organizations over the years took the view that well 
democracy is just one form of government and we would be 
ethnocentric to tout our system as the best we did not take that 
point of view 
educational choice a pet theme of the bush administration also 
will be a centerpiece of shankers opening address 
choice is a nice way to help make parents feel good about 
schools said shanker but he likely will be critical of a 
recently published brookings institution report calling for a 
radical new system allowing parents to choose freely among public 
and private schools using tax dollars 
us education secretary lauro cavazos will address the 
approximately 3000 aft delegates thursday and is expected to 
defend choice and other bush initiatives 
aft delegates may consider a boycott of several japanese 
carmakers who have resisted unionization an idea that gets a 
thumbsdown from shanker 
there are certain aflcio strict standards for boycotts 
unless they met those standards i would not support it he said 
they also will consider a resolution that would put the union on 
record against commercial classroom newscasts such as whittle 
communications channel one 
shanker was uncommittal on that issue i generally oppose the 
notion of putting commercials in the classroom on the other hand 
im on whittles advisory board it should be a good debate

it measures recessions through the gross national product the 
total value at retail prices of all goods and services produced by 
the economy in a given time period adjusted for inflation the 
gnp compiled quarterly by the commerce department is considered 
the broadest measure of economic health 
generally speaking there must be at least two consecutive

the threat of bankruptcy stalking donald trump 
has receded now that bankers have come to his rescue with a 65 
million longterm loan and debt restructuring deal 
the bailout appears to have come at a high cost to trump once 
considered by many to be financially invincible and given great 
leeway by his lenders 
in exchange for providing the fresh credit trumps rescuers 
have gained some control over his holdings and will closely monitor 
his personal and business dealings for years to come 
the breakthrough in prolonged negotiations over the loan and 
restructuring plan came tuesday when lawyers decided they didnt 
need the approval of the lone bank that continued to balk at the 
deal after some 65 to 70 decided to go along 
because paperwork on the complex deal was not complete trumps 
major lenders decided to forward him a 20 million 30day loan so 
he could make overdue payments on bonds sold to finance his trumps 
castle hotel and casino in atlantic city nj 
earlier this month trump missed a 43 million interest and 
principal payment on the castle bonds and got behind on a 30 
million bank loan 
after trump missed the initial due date on the bonds june 15 a 
10day grace period went into effect had trump failed to make the 
payments by midnight tuesday he would have been in formal default 
and the assets backing those debts could have been seized by 
creditors 
the negotiations yielded a new fiveyear commitment from trumps 
bankers that will spread out payment on more than 2 billion in 
outstanding loans over the term of the pact 
a clearly relieved trump said in an interview that he was happy 
with the outcome and confirmed that the agreement limits his 
household and personal spending to 450000 a month for the rest of 
this year 
there are certain restrictions i can live with them he 
said 
in addition there were reports that trump must stick to a 
business plan adopt a system of accounting controls and change 
accounting firms a spokeswoman for trump norma foerderer said 
she could not confirm the reports 
one source involved in the negotiations speaking on condition 
of anonymity said it could take up to two months to prepare the 
final documents on the financial rescue the large number of banks 
and attorneys involved will make the task timeconsuming the 
source said 
the financial foundation of trumps property portfolio much of 
it amassed with borrowed money has looked increasingly vulnerable 
in recent weeks a slump in the new york real estate market and 
disappointing results from his atlantic city casinos had put a cash 
squeeze on trump endangering his ability to remain current on his 
debts 
the longterm 65 million bailout and debt restructuring package 
contains numerous requirements including one that trump sell 
assets to raise cash according to the source 
it was not believed that the agreement specifies which 
properties trump must sell 
the lone holdout to the deal dresdner bank ag of west germany 
continued to withhold its consent to the deal but attorneys 
decided that dresdners endorsement wasnt essential a banking 
source said 
dresdner whose 15 million loan to trump is secured by the 
first lien on fifth avenues trump tower skyscraper has opposed 
placing a second lien on the building 
it was considered possible that dresdner might have second 
thoughts and eventually agree to the deal during the time it takes 
to complete the paperwork

the daily sports newspaper the national plans 
to expand to 13 markets from its current roster of four by april 
1991 
publisher peter price said tuesday the newspaper will commit 
more than 50 million toward equipping nine more printing sites 
the newspaper has been trying to find the right balance between 
national and local sports coverage that will attract a loyal 
readership 
in addition he said the newspaper plans to begin taking 
classified advertising next month and will begin a late edition in 
new york and chicago in july to include late sports scores 
prices comments came amid continuing uncertainty about 
prospects for the newspaper which has been publishing editions in 
new york chicago and los angeles since its launch jan 31 and 
started a san diego edition on monday 
it plans to add editions in six more markets by the end of the 
year and another three in the first three months of 1991 
critics say they doubt there is a large enough audience for 40 
to 48 pages of sports coverage that the national has been providing 
every day 
but price said the paper is meeting its targets on circulation 
and is ahead of schedule on advertising despite a generally weak 
newspaper ad market 
he said the owners of the newspaper headed by mexican media 
baron emilio azcarraga are commiting more than 50 million to 
equip nine more printing sites by the end of march 1991 to handle 
production of the fourcolor paper 
that is in addition to the 25 million spent on launching the 
newspaper in its first three cities the national now is printed at 
seven sites 
executives of the paper have said the azcarraga group is 
prepared to spend at least 100 million over five years to make the 
national profitable 
price said the paper also plans to test home delivery in one or 
two cities in september the paper has been sold almost entirely at 
newsstands convenience stores and in vending machines 
the newspapers circulation has been a topic of some conjecture 
price said tuesday that the national is selling close to 200000 
copies daily on average and expects circulation to approach 
400000 by the end of the year 
but audited figures have not yet been made available some 
industry executives have reportedly estimated the paper was selling 
as few as 115000 copies on average 
we will feel better when they supply us with some good 
circulation information said richard weigand senior vice 
president and media director for saatchi amp saatchi dfspacific in 
torrance calif 
a saatchi client toyota motor sales is one of the charter 
advertisers in the newspaper 
price said the paper has been selling 5 to 5 pages of ads a day 
on average more than the 4 pages expected and that no advertisers 
have reduced or cancelled their orders 
the newspapers expansion plans to new cities have been scaled 
back since it was launched price said initial plans called for the 
addition of two cities a month in late 1990 but said that plan 
proved too ambitious mainly because printing sites capable of 
handling the job were not readily available 
the expansion schedule through the end of the year now calls for 
editions in san francisco in july dallas in august detroit in 
september boston in october the miamifort lauderdale market in 
november and the baltimorewashington dc market in december 
price said 
the three sites for early 1991 have not been announced he said

citibank the nations largest creditcard 
issuer is taking on longdistance telephone king atampt in the 
telephone creditcard market 
citibank has enlisted mci communications corp the 
secondlargest longdistance telephone company to help it launch a 
competitor to american telephone amp telegraphs universal card the 
cards allow users to charge longdistance telephone calls on their 
visa or mastercards 
citibank began notifiying customers earlier this month of the 
service mastercard holders will be eligible for the service later 
this summer richard srednicki citibanks business manager for 
visa and mastercard said 
atampt began offering visa and mastercard services in march to 
those of its 70 million longdistance customers who are credit 
worthy the move represented a vast new entry into a highly 
competitive and profitable industry 
i dont think citibank would have done it if it hadnt been 
for atampt said spencer nilson publisher of an industry 
newsletter called the nilson report 
citibanks offer is part of a service called visaphone that visa 
is testing for banks said visa spokesman gregory holmes there are 
124 million visa cards in the united states 
its another example of how were trying to open new markets 
where bank cards are not being used to charge purchases holmes 
said he said 150 banks have expressed interest in the service but 
he didnt know which besides citibank already are involved 
since its introduction the atampt universal card has attracted 
just over 1 million customers said atampt spokesman bruce reid 
i dont think were going to react immediately to something 
like the citibank card were concentrating on trying to get a 
new product out on the market right now he said 
nilson said he doesnt expect citibanks new service to 
interfere with atampts expansion into the 423 billion credit card 
market but he said citibank can expect to find willing customers 
a recent study by nilsons newsletter predicted that within two 
years 14 percent of the 200 million visa cards and mastercards in 
circulation will double as phone charge cards 
in december us sprint the no 3 longdistance company began 
issuing a visa card that also acts as a phone charge card 
theres virtually no room for expansion in the number of 
people carrying credit cards but there is room for expansion in 
the number of cards people carry nilson said the history of 
the credit card market is that people are inclined to carry new 
cards that offer different services 
american express began offering similar service with mci in the 
early 1980s said spokeswoman nancy muller 
we offer american express card members who have mci 
residential service the opportunity to consolidate their billing on 
their american express card bill ms muller said

chrysler corps has agreed to buy 
dollar rent a car its third rental company as part of an effort 
to boost sales by showing off its cars and securing a position in 
the rental market 
the rentals showcase the vehicles to potential buyers and the 
potential for fleet orders gives us a more solid production base 
keeping the plants operating smoothly said tom jakobowski 
chrysler spokesman 
chrysler subsidiary pentastar transportation group inc on 
tuesday announced the deal chrysler used pentastar to buy the 
thrifty and snappy rental car systems in june 1989 for 236 million 
terms of the deal to buy dollar were not disclosed chrysler 
plans to complete the purchase by aug 15 
pentastar spokeswoman meloyde blancettscott in tulsa okla 
said the car maker was looking to dollar as a way to boost sales 
and get a feel for the market 
chryslers car sales through midjune lag 18 percent behind last 
year 
a new yorkbased stock analyst also said increasing chryslers 
share in the rental market could make up for a slipping retail 
share 
hypothetically if you have a smaller share of the retail 
market but a larger share of the rental market then you end up 
with a larger share altogether said charles brady of oppenheimer 
amp co 
through rentals chrysler can show off the cars it gets them 
on the roads and into the hands of executives who dont have the 
time to test drive a car brady said but theyll try a new car 
if its going to get them from one meeting to the next 
dollar the fourth largest car rental system worldwide has 
about 1000 locations and an average rental fleet of 80000 
vehicles 51000 of them in north america for fiscal 1989 dollar 
and its franchises reported revenues of more than 600 million 
dollar also operates in europe latin america the caribbean 
australia and new zealand and is opening franchises in africa and 
the middle east 
thrifty has more than 750 locations 45000 vehicles 37000 in 
north america snappy has 20000 vehicles at 250 locations 
jakobowski said dollar like thrifty and snappy would continue 
operating independently through its franchises and under the dollar 
and eurodollar names 
last october chrysler embarked on a program to slice 15 
billion from its 26billion annual budget the company reported 
71 million in earnings for the first quarter down 80 percent from 
a year ago but more than most analysts expected 
william e lobeck jr chairman of pentastar said dollars 
owner and founder henry j caruso will be retained as a 
consultant

as hundreds of companies prepare for shareholder 
meetings thursday japans sokaiya racketeers are gearing up 
for action again seeking hush money to leave the sessions 
undisturbed 
and this year may bring a new group of racketeers backed by 
japans largest underworld syndicate as it seeks to establish a 
foothold in the nations capital police say 
several sokaiya groups that are apparently backed by the 
yamaguchigumi have been increasingly active in western japan and 
some of these are also believed to be opening new operations in the 
tokyo area said a national police agency report 
the 20000plusmember yamaguchigumi syndicate has kept away 
from tokyo in the past but recently has been extending its forces 
nationwide 
sokaiya racketeers often pose as analysts or consultants and 
extort money from companies by threatening to make embarrassing 
comments or otherwise disrupt their annual shareholders meetings 
the national police agency report said there are 1307 sokaiya 
in japan another 123 gangsters are involved in sokaiya activities 
but are not considered fulltime racketeers it said 
tokyo as japans financial center is home to about 900 such 
racketeers said yoshihiro kondo head of the metropolitan police 
departments organized crime division 
kondo said 2600 officers will be called out thursday to 
discourage disturbances at the 780 general shareholders meetings 
scheduled in tokyo a special sokaiya task force is set up in the 
organized crime division each summer 
in the early 1980s police estimated there were 6000 sokaiya 
nationwide who hauled in about 390 million a year through 
blackmail schemes in one year alone 243 sokaiya were arrested 
some for extortion and others for income tax evasion 
sokaiya activity appeared to taper off after a 1982 law made it 
illegal to pay off sokaiya and increased the number of shares 
required to attend shareholders meetings 
but the sokaiya managed to bounce back kondo said 
the decreased numbers of sokaiya in the police agency report 
which was released monday may reflect merely a greater difficulty 
in identifying sokaiya he said 
sokaiya groups recently have been moving away from general 
meetings to concentrate on backstage activities which include 
coercing companies into subscribing to their publications as a form 
of hush money he said 
such publications generally contain material often gleaned from 
company employees that could create a scandal for the company if 
released widely kondo said 
businesses have banded together to fight the sokaiya by holding 
their meetings on the same day on thursday 1666 companies 
nationwide will hold shareholders meetings 
among them is koito manufacturing co which is waging a highly 
publicized battle with american investor t boone pickens pickens 
owns a 26 percent share in the auto parts maker and has demanded a 
seat on its board of directors 
last year pickens calls for increased shareholders rights 
were echoed by a number of questioners from the floor 
toughlooking men in flashy suits who badgered koito management for 
about 90 minutes 
afterward pickens said they had asked some good questions but 
he said of the tactic thats an interesting way to ask for an 
income statement 
this years koito meeting with its second round in the 
highprofile pickens conflict will be a likely target for sokaiya 
kondo said

if the president really wants to protect the california coast 
he should make it permanent not make it look as though hes just 
delaying oil drilling off our coast until after the 1990 governors 
race and his own reelection campaign in 1992 lt gov leo 
mccarthy a democrat said tuesday 
bush suspended until at least the year 2000 new leases for 
drilling off much of california oregon washington southern 
florida and new england 
he ordered further environmental studies to determine if 
drilling leases might be offered after that 
bushs decision is a major step in the right direction said 
lisa speer senior staff scientist for the natural resources 
defense council 
but she complained that bush did not address some areas where 
lease sales are upcoming including the midatlantic coast 
alaskas bristol bay and northern florida 
the moratorium also doesnt stop drilling under way in the gulf 
of mexico off alaska and off california 
nevertheless the ban was a major shift in a us policy to 
decrease reliance on foreign oil the nation imports half its oil 
the reagan administration had favored opening the entire 
continental shelf to oil and gas drilling 
locking up these energyrich lands at a time when our 
dependency on foreign energy is escalating is a serious mistake 
the american petroleum institute said in a statement 
oil companies acknowledged public worry over oil drilling 
however 
president bush has recognized that most americans are not 
prepared at this time to develop certain environmentally sensitive 
offshore areas los angelesbased arco said in a statement 
arco supports the president under these circumstances 
democrats speculated that bush wanted to help republican 
gubernatorial candidates in california and florida who oppose 
offshore oil drilling and could have been hurt politically by new 
drilling after oil spills like the exxon valdez and mega borg 
some observers also said bush may be thinking about his own 
reelection prospects 
the presidents decision to delay leasing and development for 
10 years off most of californias coast is an important concession 
to the political reality but it merely postpones the controversy 
instead of solving it said ann notthoff of the natural resources 
defense council in san francisco 
republican sen pete wilson faces former san francisco mayor 
dianne feinstein in the gubernatorial race both oppose offshore 
drilling 
feinstein could have made a decision to allow drilling into a 
firstrate campaign issue but wilson could have used it to show 
his independence said pollster mervin field whose polls show 
californians opposed to offshore drilling 74 percent to 21 percent 
another california pollster steve teichner said the real 
political implications would be for bush bush carried only 511 
percent of the california vote in 1988 it would have been a big 
problem for him in 1992 if he had not protected the coast 
teichner said 
in florida republican gov martinez opposes offshore drilling 
as do his leading democratic opponents former sen lawton chiles 
and rep bill nelson who face each other in a sept 4 primary 
martinez was pleased with the moratorium but not with bushs 
proposal that the state help buy back 73 leases sold to oil firms 
for drilling off the keys florida officials estimated the buyback 
could cost 100 million to 200 million 
the people of florida should not be asked to bear what is 
rightly a federal responsibility martinez said 
along the new england coast bushs ban affects georges bank a 
vital fishing ground east of massachusetts cape cod 
anybody who knows or cares about georges bank should be 
delighted said rep gerry studds dmass hes not even going 
to be president by the year 2000 hes done all that he can for 
georges bank on his watch 
california assemblyman tom hayden a democrat called bushs 
actions a major victory for environmentalists 
we have won time up to 10 years hayden said so im 
thankful for the actions in washington whatever the motives are

president bushs decision to postpone oil 
drilling off southern florida leaves in limbo 73 oil leases already 
bought from the government and is likely to prompt a court battle 
over how much the leases are worth 
bush on tuesday imposed a 10year moratorium on oil development 
in environmentally sensitive areas off southern florida as well as 
off the coasts of california washington and new england 
unlike in california where the leases under consideration have 
yet to be put up for sale a group of oil companies already own 73 
leases off florida within the 13 million acres under presidential 
review the leases were purchased in 1983 and 1984 for 108 million 
exploratory drilling would have begun immediately in two of the 
sites if bush had given the goahead 
what happens to the leases now that bush put a hold on further 
oil activity there 
on tuesday bush announced his administration would begin 
negotiations with the state of florida to work out a joint effort 
to purchase the leases from the oil companies that bought them for 
108 million federal officials have said they want florida to bear 
a substantial portion of the cost but the state has indicated 
buying the leases should be left to washington since the federal 
government sold the leases 
the people of florida should not be asked to bear what is 
rightly a federal responsibility gov bob martinez said tuesday 
the oil companies could hold onto them but most industry 
experts doubt they will choose to do so they cite the opposition 
of environmentalists that they say is all but certain to intensify 
the longer drilling is delayed 
were kind of in unchartered territory here says mike 
kimmit a spokesman for mobil oil co which owns 22 of the leases 
he said the leases were acquired with the expectation that drilling 
could be pursued oil would be discovered and a profit could be 
made 
mobil has been ready to begin exploratory drilling for some time 
on one of the leases 60 miles west of the florida keys but was 
prevented from doing so because of state opposition a 
congressional moratorium and the review by bush 
industry experts agree that if the leases are sold back to the 
government the asking price will be much more than the 108 million 
the companies paid the interior department for them they may 
demand 200 million or even more suggest interior officials 
in addition to the original sale price there are exploratory 
and administration costs various fees interest on the money paid 
to the government and possibly the value of any known resources 
says rupert turner manager of government relations for shell oil 
co 
shell owns 16 of the leases other lease holders include mobil 
amoco city services chevron union oil tenneco and texaco 
the interior department which handles oil lease sales on the 
outer continental shelf is likely to contest any claim by oil 
companies that they be paid for the loss of oil reserves in the 
lease areas 
i dont believe theres a lot of oil in that area said 
interior secretary manuel lujan when asked about the 73 leases in a 
recent interview lujan said if the oil companies seek payment for 
the loss of potential oil discoveries we would be talking about 
hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars 
the outcome likely will be settled in court government 
officials and industry representatives say 
according to the law the interior department could take back 
the leases but lujan has ruled out unilateral action i would 
not want to be the one to cancel those leases i would lose 
credibility for the sale of future leases he said 
lujan has suggested the state of florida might purchase the 
leases but so far no agreement has been reached 
florida gov bob martinez told federal officials the state would 
pay no more than 10 million as its share while lujan has said the 
federal government wants to put in no more than 40 million 
its really the federal governments responsibility theyre 
the ones who made the profits who sold the leases and who should 
pay the lions share in any buyback says estes whitfield 
martinez director of environmental affairs 
whitfield maintains that the oil companies bought the leases 
knowing there were environmental concerns that might prevent 
drilling oil companies abandon many oil leases as a normal course 
of exploring for oil he said

the chicago board of trade has a selling job to 
do even if federal regulators approve the exchanges request to 
trade insurance risk alongside soybeans and treasury bonds 
some people in the insurance industry expressed skepticism 
tuesday about the proposal to trade reinsurance futures the 
exchange argued that the innovative products would allow insurers 
to stabilize underwriting risks resulting in lower insurance costs 
for consumers 
my general feeling would be a waitandsee attitude said 
dan kummer vice president of administration and finance in the 
business insurance division of allstate insurance co 
from my point of view im not sure i would see this as a 
replacement for some kinds of reinsurance kummer said in a 
telephone interview from allstates headquarters in suburban 
northbrook 
but burton gutterman a board of trade director told a news 
conference the insurance industry will embrace the products once it 
learns how to use them just as onceskeptical banks have become 
regular traders of the exchanges interestrate futures 
there are a lot of questions that have to be answered he 
said thats a process the board of trade is committed to 
pursuing 
gutterman said the exchange on monday submitted proposals for 
two reinsurance contracts to the commodity futures trading 
commission for approval 
the contracts would offer insurers a new way to reduce their 
risk on auto and health insurance policies while creating new 
markets for speculators 
reinsurance is the practice among insurance companies of selling 
policies to other insurers reinsurers to spread the risk around 
the proposed futures contracts would be agreements for future 
deliveries of reinsurance certificates based on pools of auto and 
health insurance policies the value of a contract would represent 
the difference between the premiums collected and claims paid on 
the pool of policies 
in an unusual twist the board of trade would employ a central 
custodian to inspect and qualify all policies 
the custodian also would act as a clearinghouse for information 
about premiums and claims theoretically providing all market 
participants with a level playing field the exchange said in a 
statement 
the board of trade said that by buying and selling the 
contracts insurers could effectively reinsure some of their 
policies through the exchange 
the insurance markets represent a huge financial sector that 
currently has very limited ways by which to manage its considerable 
risk board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann said in a 
statement 
gutterman said that pending cftc approval of the contracts the 
board of trade would lobby state insurance commissioners to allow 
insurers in their states to use the contracts for reinsurance 
kevin hennosy a spokesman for the national association of 
insurance commissioners said he had not seen the board of trade 
proposals 
we certainly would have an interest in how this would impact 
the consumer and how such a proposal would be regulated hennosy 
said from his office in kansas city mo

democrats must agree to major spending cuts as 
the price for president bushs concession that taxes will have to 
be raised to attack the budget deficit a leading senate republican 
said today 
sen pete domenici rnm made the remark on cbstvs cbs 
this morning as negotiators from the white house and congress 
resumed their deficitreduction negotiations 
its time to summit or get off the pot sen phil gramm of 
texas a republican bargainer told reporters as the closeddoor 
talks got under way 
bush said tuesday that a budget pact will require tax revenue 
increases which democrats hailed as an abandonment of his no 
new taxes campaign pledge domenici the ranking republican on 
the senate budget committee said the key question is not whether 
gop lawmakers will back the presidents new position 
its whether democrats will now restrain spending enough to 
make a package that is indeed right for america he said 
on the same program the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee said increased excise taxes will have to be part of any 
deficitreduction package 
excise taxes are going to be necessary in the equation because 
you raise revenues immediately said rep dan rostenkowski dill 
the government levies excise taxes on fuels cigarettes liquor 
and other items rostenkowski did not specify which tax increases 
he favors but in the past has advocated boosts in gasoline 
cigarette and alcohol levies 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois today gave a 
cautious reading of bushs statement appearing on nbcs today 
show michel said the president didnt tell us yesterday the 
first thing i want you to do is go down there and raise taxes 
but house speaker thomas s foley appearing on the same 
program said that bush by his statement has said publicly and 
clearly that he believes new taxes are necessary 
there are going to be some hard hits michel said the 
president is taking a hit for the moment i think temporarily 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine told reporters 
today that continued stiff opposition among congressional 
republicans to a tax increase may make it difficult to pass 
whatever agreement is reached by negotiators he added that any 
agreement including a tax increase will have to be acceptable to 
a majority of members of both parties in both houses 
the search by white house and congressional negotiators for a 
way to cut the mounting deficit was resuming today the 1991 
shortfall could exceed 200 billion well above the 74 billion 
limit set by the grammrudman law 
bush did not specify which taxes he would consider boosting and 
white house officials insisted that would be up to negotiators 
nonetheless lawakers agreed that the presidents comments will 
help the talks which have dragged on fruitlessly since midmay 
it opens the door to serious negotiations at the summit 
said rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee 
many democrats said bush had done them a political favor as 
well they said he blurred an issue the gop has used successfully 
against democrats across the country since president reagans 
campaigns 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee and a former head of his states democratic party said 
it would be implausible for republicans to use the issue in 
campaigns 
what are they going to say when the president comes to their 
district to campaign for them sasser said or will he come 
hes not only neutralized the issue for 1990 but perhaps 
stewed up in the republican party a question about a lack of 
identity said rep richard durbin dill 
bushs statement also called for cuts in defense domestic 
programs budget process changes and growth incentives often 
used to describe the capital gains tax reduction that bush wants 
but it was his support for tax increases that outraged 
conservative republicans by tuesday evening 90 of the 176 house 
republicans had signed a letter to bush saying they were stunned 
by your announcement and calling such an increase unacceptable 
tax increases at the present time would undermine the economy 
and substantially weaken it said rep robert walker rpa who 
circulated the message 
other republicans insisted that in an effort to boost the 
stalled budget talks the president had merely restated his 
longstanding promise to consider all options for saving money 
i dont see how its a change in anything said sen 
domenici 
rep guy vander jagt rmich chairman of the national 
republican congressional committee said bushs remarks did nothing 
to eliminate the tax issue 
his senate counterpart sen don nickles rokla said the 
presidents statement may cloud the issue a little bit but 
nickles who heads the national republican senatorial committee 
said most republicans still would use the tax issue 
most of our challengers are more opposed to taxes than the 
incumbents are he said

of 739 million acres compared with the usdas march projection of 
748 million and last years 723 million

the supreme court today upheld federal 
policies that favor minorities in awarding broadcast licenses a 
majo victory for affirmative action 
by a 54 vote the justices said the federal communications 
comission policies do not discriminate unlawfully against whites 
the court did not address the issue of womens rights but fcc 
affirmative action policies treat women and minorities almost 
identically 
in a case from florida the court allowed the commission to give 
special favorable consideration to minorities in awarding a 
television station license 
in a case from connecticut the court upheld the commissions 
socalled distresssale policy which allows a broadcaster faced 
with the loss of its license to sell to a minorityowned business 
at 75 percent of market value 
todays ruling which came in a consolidation of the two cases 
is a surprising victory for affirmative action from a conservative 
supreme court 
throughout the history of the case the fcc has argued womens 
rights were at issue the associated press initially reported that 
the ruling affected both women and minorities but in a footnote in 
his 50page majority opinion justice william j brennan said the 
court did not address gender preferences 
the footnote referring to a broad fcc policy statement says 
the fcc also announced in its 1978 statement a tax certificate 
policy and other minority preferences which are not at issue 
today similarly the commissions gender preference policy is 
not before us today 
legal experts said they are confident the ruling also will 
permit the fcc to continue its policy of giving prefential 
treatment as well to women seeking broadcast licenses although the 
court did not specifically address that issue 
andrew jay schwartzman a communications lawyer said he was 
delighted with the ruling and said preferential treatment for women 
applicants appears to be on safe ground 
a similar policy for women i believe would also be upheld 
he said 
in its most important previous ruling on preferential minority 
treatment by the federal government a more liberal high court in 
1980 upheld a public works program that set aside a percentage of 
federal funds for minority contracts 
more recently however the court has trimmed affirmative action 
programs last year the justices struck down a richmond va 
program that set aside a percentage of local public works contracts 
for minorityowned businesses that ruling cast doubt on the 
validity of numerous similar plans of states and cities but had no 
bearing on federal programs 
todays ruling came as congress and the bush administration 
continue negotiations to settle differences on the proposed civil 
rights act of 1990 a bill aimed at erasing the effects of the 
earlier supreme court decisions weakening affirmative action 
programs 
administration officials say theyre concerned that provisions 
of the bill permitting suits by individuals alleging hiring 
discrimination are so strong in terms of potential damages that 
they would if enacted lead businesses to reinstitute hiring 
quotas 
the bill as now written goes beyond the traditional 
discrimination remedies of restoration of job and back pay 
today the justices said they owe special deference to federal 
programs that give preferential treatment to minorities 
brennan writing for the court said 
it is of overriding significance in these cases that the fccs 
minority ownership programs have been specifically approved 
indeed mandated by congress 
we hold that benign raceconscious measures mandated by 
congress even if those measures are not remedial in the sense of 
being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or 
societal discrimination are constitutionally permissible to the 
extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the 
power of congress and are substantially related to achievement of 
those objectives 
brennan was joined by justices byron r white thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
the dissenters were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
oconnor in an opinion joined by the other dissenters said the 
ruling violates fundamental principles requiring the government 
to treat all americans equally 
the court departs from these fundamental principles and from 
our traditional requirement that racial classifications are 
permissible only if necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve a 
compelling interest she said 
the fcc said its policies adopted in 1978 are intended to 
promote diversity over the nations airwaves by letting missing 
voices be heard on radio and television 
but the commission has not always supported affirmative action 
wholeheartedly when ronald reagan was president the fcc 
considered scrapping the policies 
the current commission has called for broadening minority 
representation in the broadcast industry but the bush 
administrations justice department has disagreed with the fccs 
policies 
justice department lawyers told the court that the affirmative 
action policies are invalid because congress did not initiate them 
and design them narrowly to correct past bias 
but congress expressed itself on the issue in 1987 by passing an 
appropriations bill that barred the fcc from spending any money to 
review or scrap its affirmative action policies 
the fccs support for affirmative action has had limited 
success the commission said minorities control 35 percent of the 
nations radio and tv stations compared to less than 1 percent in 
1978 
other federal affirmative action programs have been adopted by 
the transportation and defense departments and by the small 
business administration 
in the florida case the fcc awarded hispanicowned rainbow 
broadcasting co a new tv license in orlando a threejudge federal 
appeals court panel in the district of columbia upheld by the 
high court ruled that a rival metro broadcasting inc was not 
denied the license unfairly 
in the connecticut case a different panel of the same appeals 
court struck down the fccs distresssale policy and ordered 
hispanicled astroline communications co to surrender its license 
for whcttv in hartford the appeals court reversed by the 
justices ruled for rival broadcaster alan shurberg who is white 
james l winston executive director of the national association 
of blackowned broadcasters said the courts decision means the 
fccs ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward 
without fear of constitutional challenge 
the polices have been effective over the past 12 years in 
increasing the number of minorityowned stations in general and 
particularly the ownership by africanamericans from 30 radio 
stations and one television station to the point where we now have 
182 radio stations and 17 television stations 
said kernie anderson general manager of blackowned wdasfmam 
in philadelphia one of the first stations sold under the distress 
sale policy 
this reflects a continuation of a policy that has benefited 
not only africanamericans but women and the entire nation it has 
made for greater diversity in our industry for the supreme court 
to uphold the righteousness of what indeed was a just action by the 
commission is appreciated by an africanamerican 
the cases acted upon today are metro broadcasting vs fcc 
89453 and astroline communications vs shurberg broadcasting 
89700

atampt today said its profit in the second quarter 
likely will be lower than last years in part because sales of 
various products have fallen short of expectations 
the softness will make it more difficult for american telephone 
amp telegraph co to meet its objective of achieving 10 percent to 12 
percent growth in earnings this year the company said in a 
statement 
but atampt said it stands by its earlier projection that net 
income for all of 1990 would rise to a record level this years 
profit is expected to surpass the 1989 earnings of 27 billion or 
250 a share 
the news sent the companys stock price sliding in midday 
trading on the new york stock exchange atampt shares were selling 
for 3862 off 262 from tuesdays close earlier this morning 
the shares were off as much as 350 
the company blamed market conditions and a sluggish economy for 
weakening its product sales in the quarter that will end june 30 
atampt spokesman dick gray said results from april and may 
indicate sales to small and large us businesses of telephone 
equipment including such things as electronic switchboards have 
been unexpectedly low 
sales of network telecommunications products such as switching 
equipment cable and transmissions systems also have been below 
anticipated levels gray said there has been some weakness in 
sales to the federal government he added 
atampt also said sales in its computer division have lagged 
meanwhile heavy demand for atampts universal card has caused 
expenses associated with processing card applications to rise in 
the second quarter the company said atampt called the demand for 
the new credit card introduced in march unprecendented and twice 
the level expected 
analysts called atampts announcement disappointing but said they 
believed the companys profit for the entire year would rise as 
atampt promised 
george kelly of morgan stanley amp co said this was the first 
time atampt announced its quarterly earnings would be below analysts 
expectations in the six years since it spun off its regional phone 
operating companies 
this has come as a real surprise to analysts who follow the 
company kelly said 
he attributed the slowdown in purchases of corporate phone 
systems in part to the nationwide commercial real estate slump as 
fewer companies move to new quarters fewer phone systems are sold 
he said 
in addition atampt has faced increased competitor in the office 
phone market from rolm which is owned by international business 
machines corp and siemens ag of west germany kelly said 
in the market for centraloffice switches which are the nerve 
center of phone companies atampt has seen increased competitor from 
lm ericsson of sweden kelly said 
atampt has always had a coststructure problem in their 
equipment business and they have done a good job of controlling 
that he said but we havent really witnessed a downturn in 
demand 
stuart crane an analyst at gruntal amp co said demand for 
centraloffice switches has softened as the regional phone 
operating companies have completed a cycle of buying new equipment 
in last years second quarter atampt earned 699 million or 65 
cents a share on revenue of 926 billion 
in light of atampts statement today kelly estimated earnings 
this quarter will be 63 cents a share while crane put the figure 
at 62 cents

ted turners total pay increased 66 percent to 
729952 last year boosted in part by an incentive plan adopted by 
his companys board of directors in 1989 according to a turner 
broadcasting system inc proxy statement 
the tbs chairman who owns about 15 billion worth of turner 
broadcastings outstanding stock earned a 197513 bonus in 1989 
that brought his total cash compensation to 729952 compared with 
total cash compensation of 440649 in 1988 according to the proxy 
statement released tuesday 
the cable television company which owns superstation wtbs in 
atlanta and produces the cable news network cnn headline news and

the company proposed to triple the number of authorized shares 
of its class a common stock from 25 million shares to 75 million 
shares and double class b shares from 150 million to 300 million

talks between japan and the united states on 
structural trade reforms progressed late wednesday night with a 
lastminute breakthrough on the issue of increasing japans public 
works spending officials said 
prime minister toshiki kaifu conveyed japans final offer on the 
issue to president george bush in a telephone conversation late 
wednesday night 
bush said he would hear details of the talks from us officials 
and expressed appreciation for kaifus efforts according to a 
highranking foreign ministry official 
this represents a breakthrough said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity without an agreement on public works 
spending tonight i doubt we could finish the talks by tomorrow 
foreign ministry officials said they could not confirm reports 
that japanese and us officials had agreed on a final figure of 
277 trillion in public works spending over the next 10 years 
local media citing unidentified government sources said kaifu 
and other top japanese officials meeting in a lastditch move to 
salvage the talks had agreed to increase their original proposal 
of 268 trillion by 9677 billion 
us officials accepted the proposal kyodo news service 
reported 
the united states claims that japan needs to offset its high 
savings rate which gives japanese businesses a relatively cheaper 
source of capital than their us counterparts with more 
government spending which can boost such capital costs as interest 
rates 
washington had requested that tokyo commit itself to spending at 
least 322 trillion over the next decade 
japanese officials expressed concern that such a large increase 
would stimulate inflation 
earlier wednesday night us officials had said the talks were 
at an impasse due to conflicts over public works spending and other 
issues despite a decision by bush to take stronger action to cut 
the us budget deficit 
a senior us official participating in the talks complained 
that japan had failed to show political will to match bushs 
decision on tuesday to accept tax increases to help cut the us 
deficit 
it took more political courage to raise tax revenues than it 
would to increase public spending the official said on condition 
he not be named the president made an important decision we 
hope our japanese friends realize that 
doing more to cut its budget deficit is one of washingtons key 
commitments in the current round of trade talks called the 
structural impediments initiative 
the talks are intended to attack japans 49 billion surplus in 
trade with the united states by taking steps to remedy fundamental 
problems in both countries such as the us budget deficit and 
japans toughtocrack business systems seen as hindering trade 
and competitiveness 
this weeks talks were to prepare a final version of an interim 
report issued in april 
officials said they expected to work through the night in order 
to complete the report by midday thursday prior commitments on 
both sides required that the current talks end then or resume 
sometime next week they said 
the meetings originally were scheduled to end tuesday but have 
dragged on as officials haggled over the many topics under 
discussion 
the us official said progress had been made on opening japans 
products distribution system and improving land use and customs 
facilities and operations there also was progress on measures by 
washington to curb demand for imports improve competitiveness of 
us products and slash the federal budget deficit 
but he said negotiators were still split on issues related to 
exclusionary business practices and the speed of processing patent 
applications and over the private right to take legal action over 
unfair business practices 
japanese officials were dissatisfied with us proposals on 
easing export controls for oil and strategically sensitive 
products he said 
both sides say they are anxious to reach agreement before the 
july 9 summit of the seven major industrialized democracies in 
houston

koito manufacturing co said wednesday it has 
overwhelming support from most of its shareholders to reject the 
demand by t boone pickens jr for a voice in running the company 
pickens and 52 other americans own 26 percent of the total 
shares in the japanese auto parts maker 
for its general sareholders meeting thursday koito said it has 
received proxies representing 83 percent of the other shares 
supporting its position against pickens proxies representing 2 
percent of those other shares support pickens it stated 
pickens and his allies are in japan for the meeting where they 
plan to renew demands for four seats on koitos 20member board of 
directors 
we are gratified at the overwhelming support that management 
has received from our shareholders tomoatsu aoyama a koito 
director was saying in the companys statement 
after corporate raider boone pickens lengthy and highly 
visible campaign to attack koito disrupt our business and create 
controversy to further his greenmail scheme it is revealing that 
he can obtain the support of fewer than 2 percent of the other 
shareholders he said 
mark helmke a representative of pickens said he was not 
surprised at the small showing overall for the texas oilman but 
he said pickens boone co had received support from more than 
half of the 4 million or so average japanese investors 
our support is from the average investor helmke said 
koitos support is from the keiretsu 
keiretsu are corporate networks bound by mutual shareholdings 
financial or personnel ties in koitos case toyota motor corp 
japans biggest automaker owns about 20 percent of the companys 
stock and buys about half the auto lighting equipment it sells 
pickens says keiretsu tend to exclude outsiders especially 
foreigners he says koitos status as a subcontractor in toyotas 
keiretsu squeezes koito profits depriving him of a fair return as 
a stockholder 
by losing the vote tomorrow we will show that the keiretsu 
system is stacked against the small investor in japan as it is 
against the united states said helmke 
koito has maintained that pickens is really interested in having 
the company buy back his shares at a premium a charge he denies 
and has rejected his demands for a greater say in running the 
company

the state of california today sued lincoln 
savings and loan chief charles h keating jr for alleged fraud in 
the sale of 250 million in nowworthless junk bonds 
the accounting company that backed claims about the bonds 
safety was also named as a defendant 
attorney general john van de kamp said the defendants include 
jack atchison the employee of the arthur young amp co accounting 
firm who handled the account of american continental corp 
lincolns parent company 
the highrisk highinterest rate bonds sold mainly to elderly 
southern californians at lincoln branches were issued by american 
continental 
federal regulators say the failure of lincoln may cost taxpayers 
2 billion 
charles keating and his associates at american continental 
corporation were running a huge financial con game and sucking the 
assets out of lincoln savings to sustain their operations van de 
kamp said 
atchison was later hired by american continental for 900000 a 
year four times what he was making at arthur young 
it takes no great insight to understand why he was worth that 
princely sum to acc van de kamp said 
the suit filed in state court in orange county seeks 
restitution of the 250 million in bonds from keating other 
american continental officers and directors atchison and arthur 
young which is now doing business as ernst amp young 
van de kamp said he will seek civil penalties that could range 
from 50 million to 100 million 
a keating attorney james ham said today that many of the legal 
actions against keating including a 21 billion lawsuit by the 
resolution trust corp in phoenix ariz were grandstanding 
because his client is broke 
van de kamp agreed in part saying theres little hope that 
any american continental assets will be left over to repay the 
bond holders that is why we have taken the time and expense to 
thoroughly investigate the liability of others who might be 
responsible 
a call for comment from ernst amp young was not immediately 
returned by the firms spokeswoman elizabeth coleman

peter a cohen who was ousted as chairman of 
shearson lehman hutton inc earlier this year will receive a 
severance package worth about 10 million individuals familiar 
with the pact said wednesday 
cohen was ousted by american express cos chairman james d 
robinson iii as part of an overhaul designed to stem mounting 
losses and morale problems at the nations second largest 
securities firm 
the severance package completes the much publicized separation 
as the firm continues a major restructuring that includes returning 
to its old shearson lehman brothers name 
cohen will receive 26 million in severance pay plus stock and 
options amassed during a 20year career that values the total 
package at about 10 million according to people familiar with the 
package who asked not to be named 
the individuals said the severance pay was calculated at about 
one months pay for each year of service or about 130000 a month 
shearson though technically doesnt sever all ties with cohen 
under the package the firm agreed to retain cohen as a consultant 
until march 1991 and pay for an office and secretary outside 
shearsons headquarters that will allow cohen to receive some 
benefits to which he is entitled 
we believe it is a fair and equitable settlement that 
recognizes mr cohens significant contributions to shearson lehman 
hutton over 20 years of dedicated service gary beller american 
express executive vice president and general counsel said in a 
statement 
we wish him well in his future endeavors the statement said 
other american express and shearson officials declined to 
comment 
cohen 43 was ousted from the firm in january and replaced by a 
top american express executive howard l clark jr 
cohen was instrumental in shearsons expansion into the 
investment banking field in 1984 with the acquisition of lehman 
brothers kuhn loeb he also led the january 1988 acquisition of 
defunct brokerage ef hutton amp co for 962 million 
the latter deal along with shearsons failed role in the rjr 
nabisco inc takeover have been blamed for many of shearsons 
current problems 
shearson lost 915 million in the first quarter of 1990 the 
largest loss ever on wall street most of the loss was to pay for a 
restructuring that included thousands of layoffs and the 
elimination or reduction of several businesses 
american express plans to acquire all the shearson stock it does 
not own 
shearson earlier this month said it was grouping into two 
divisions from four shearson lehman brothers for individual 
investing and asset management and lehman brothers for investment 
banking and capital markets activities the full firm will be known 
as shearson lehman brothers inc 
the severance agreement with cohen was presented by american 
express board to cohen about two months ago as part of the 
package cohen must repay an oustanding loan to shearson taken to 
purchase company stock about two years ago about equal to the 26 
million in severance pay 
additionally cohen is prevented from suing directors and 
officers of shearson american express and members of their 
families

insurance market lloyds of london announced a 45 
percent drop in underwriting profit wednesday for its most recent 
reporting year largely because of asbestos and pollution claims in 
the united states 
lloyds said underwriting profit totaled 4117 million pounds or 
716 million in 1987 compared with 7445 million pounds a year 
earlier 
lloyds announces earnings figures three years late to give it 
time to get a more accurate idea of the claims that will fall due 
on policies written during those years 
the company said pretax profit dropped 22 percent to 5091 
million pounds or 886 million from 6494 million pounds a year 
earlier 
total net premium income an insurance industry version of 
revenues rose 135 percent to 42 billion pounds or 73 billion 
from 37 billion pounds in 1986 
chairman murray lawrence said the insurance market faces even 
leaner times over the next two reporting years 
when the 1988 claims are tallied he said it appears as 
though it will be profitable but it will reflect the impact of 
overcapacity throughout the industry which became evident that 
year 
for 1989 he predicted an overall loss for the market lawrence 
cited an unusual number of major claims which were particularly 
damaging since the disasters occurred at a time of keenly 
competitive premium rates 
lawrence said that although the 1987 results showed a reasonable 
overall profit there was some variance between markets while 
aviation and motor markets produced impressive profits and marine 
showed results in line with 1986 nonmarine insurance underwriting 
results were disappointing lawrence said 
the drop in nonmarine underwriting results came from asbestos 
claims and pollution problems on us business he said 
lloyds reports profits once a year 
the figures were converted at the current exchange rate of 174 
to the pound

energy futures prices continued their downward 
drift wednesday led by a steep slide in wholesale gasoline prices 
trading picked up to about average volume after recent sluggish 
sessions on the new york mercantile exchange energy analysts said 
the contract for july delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline 
tumbled 183 cents to settle at 5949 cents a gallon expanding on 
tuesdays loss of 095 cent contracts for later delivery also 
finished significantly lower 
among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange 
the july home heating oil contract slid 056 to 4793 cents a 
gallon after falling 043 cent tuesday contracts for delivery 
during august through october posted similar declines 
the august contract of west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil shed another 46 cents to close at 1668 a 
42gallon barrel that was wider than tuesdays drop of 24 cents 
other nearby crude contracts fell 
in natural gas trading the august contract closed at 1500 per 
1000 cubic feet it was the lowest settlement for the nearmonth 
contract since the new york merc began trading natural gas in early 
april it was down from the closing level of 1507 tuesday 
jim fiedler an energy specialist for edampf man international 
futures inc said the selloff in gasoline was the catalyst for the 
markets overall weakness he said brokers are puzzled because gas 
demand is still lagging despite the start of the peak summer 
driving season 
weekly statistics released late tuesday by the american 
petroleum institute indicated gas demand is running about 5 percent 
behind last year 
crude meanwhile has been under pressure because there is a 
glut of oil available which hasnt shown signs of abating fiedler

news that atampts secondquarter profit will be 
lower than a year ago and below analysts expectations sent the 
price of the nations most widely held stock sliding wednesday 
the announcement by american telephone amp telegraph co was the 
first time since the 1984 breakup of the former bell system that 
the nations largest phone company has given advance warning of a 
lower profit 
the company blamed the expected earnings slide in the quarter 
ending saturday partly on lowerthanexpected sales of telephone 
equipment 
atampt would not predict how much the drop would be it said it 
would release secondquarter results in midjuly 
analysts said the news was surprising but they did not doubt 
atampts forecast that profit for the entire year would be at a 
record high 
all this suggests to me is a temporary profit margin 
squeeze with a reversal over the next six months said stuart 
crane who follows atampt for the investment firm gruntal amp co 
the fundamentals of atampt are strong he said i dont 
agree with throwing out the stock 
in nationwide new york stock exchange trading atampt shares 
closed at 3912 down 212 from tuesdays close earlier the 
shares were down as much as 350 about 115 million shares 
changed hands wednesday nearly nine times the average daily volume 
atampt estimates it has 25 million shareholders more than any 
other us company about 40 percent of the shares are held by 
individuals 
atampt spokesman dick gray said results from april and may 
indicate sales to us businesses of equipment such as electronic 
switchboards and private phone systems have been unexpectedly low 
sales of products to telephone operating companies such as 
switching equipment also have been less than anticipated gray 
said as have been sales to the federal government 
atampt also said sales in its computer division have lagged 
the company said the lower equipment sales were due to market 
conditions and a sluggish economy 
atampt does not disclose how much of its profit it derives from 
individual business segments 
meanwhile heavy demand for atampts new universal card has caused 
expenses associated with processing applications for the credit 
card to rise the company said 
atampt called demand for the card twice the level expected the 
card which combines a phone charge card with a mastercard or visa 
was introduced in march 
the company said the expected decline in secondquarter earnings 
will make it more difficult to meet its objective of 10 percent to 
12 percent profit growth this year but it stands by its earlier 
projection that net income for all of 1990 will break last years 
record high in 1989 atampt earned 27 billion or 250 a share 
on revenue of 36 billion 
for several years atampt has been cutting costs by reducing 
employment levels 
in april atampt reached agreement with its unions to offer early 
retirement to about 34000 workers the program follows one offered 
last year to managers under which about 12000 opted for early 
retirement atampt has about 315000 employees 
atampt also plans to continue to move workers into sales and 
marketing jobs to increase revenue gray said 
george kelly an analyst at morgan stanley amp co attributed the 
slowdown in sales of corporate phone systems partly to the 
nationwide commercial real estate slump as fewer companies move to 
new quarters fewer phone systems are sold he said 
atampt also faces increased competition in the office phone market 
from rolm which is owned by international business machines corp 
and siemens ag of west germany kelly said 
in the market for centraloffice switches the nerve center of 
phone companies atampt has seen increased competition from lm 
ericsson of sweden kelly said 
gruntals crane said demand for centraloffice switches has 
softened as the regional phone operating companies have completed a 
cycle of buying new equipment but he predicted an upturn in two to 
three years as atampt comes out with new opticalbased central 
switches the company is several years ahead of competitors in this 
advanced technology he said 
in last years second quarter atampt earned 699 million or 65 
cents a share on revenue of 926 billion 
in light of atampts statement kelly estimated earnings this 
quarter would be 63 cents a share while crane put the figure at 62 
cents gregory sawers an analyst at sanford c bernstein amp co 
estimated 60 cents

apparel manufacturer salant corp sought refuge 
in bankruptcy court wednesday after struggling unsuccessfully with 
debts incurred in buying a larger rival two years ago 
it was the second filing under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code for the new yorkbased clothing company whose 
nationally known brands include dr denton sleepwear john henry 
shirts and lady manhattan sportswear 
salant attributed its troubles to weakness in the retail 
business at a time of year that is always the slowest for the 
company 
the fate of salant furnished another example of what can happen 
when companies fail to generate enough cash to pay for takeovers 
financed with borrowed money the retail industry on which salant 
relies for its business has had its share of victims including 
campeau corps federated and allied department store divisions and 
ames department stores inc 
ray w williams salants chairman and chief executive said in 
a news release that continued softness in the retail apparel 
market during the traditional low point of our seasonal business 
has made it impossible for us to satisfy our obligations to our 
lenders on a timely basis 
the bankruptcy filing was foreshadowed in midjune when salant 
diclosed discussions with lenders about refinancing its debts 
that news came as salant revealed it was in default on 108 
million in principal and interest on bank loans and couldnt cover 
19 million due on certain bonds 
the company said then that it was looking into alternatives 
including a second bankruptcy filing 
salant emerged from its first bankruptcy case three years ago 
shortly thereafter it began building a stake in manhattan 
industries inc a much bigger competitor that it eventually bought 
for 105 million in the spring of 1988 
retail analysts said there has been a perception within the 
trade that salant undertook too big a task when it bought manhattan 
in an effort to broaden its line of national brands 
until the takeover salant mainly made private label clothing 
for retailers such as sears roebuck and co and jc penney co it 
also has the thomson trouser co 
in buying manhattan salant gained ownership of various perry 
ellis lines manhattan shirts lady manhattan sportswear and the 
vera label of scarves and other items 
the pessimism about salants prospects have been reflected in 
the companys stock price it closed at 287 a share in composite 
new york stock exchange trading wednesday off 25 cents from 
tuesday and down from a high of 2687 in the last 52 weeks 
salants firstquarter loss widened to 23 million from the 
427000 loss a year earlier 
edward johnson director of the johnson redbook service of 
prescott ball amp turben inc in new york said salants chairman 
overreached in buying manhattan and in retrospect paid too high a 
price 
his appetite was a little too strong johnson said 
still he believes williams stands a decent chance of turning 
salant around he noted that williams proved himself an able 
manager as president of the farah manufacturing co 
hes a capable man said johnson 
in the news release williams said the company believes it can 
continue operating effectively while negotiating with its creditors 
and attempting a courtsupervised reorganization salants denton 
mills inc subsidiary was included in the bankruptcy filing 
he said the cit groupfactoring has agreed to forward 100 
million in working capital to salant an arrangement which must be 
approved by the bankruptcy court cit is a company that acts as a 
financial middleman in transactions between apparel manufacturers 
and retailers 
alan millstein publisher of the new york newsletter fashion 
network report said salant has had a history of missteps with the 
manhattan takeover only the latest misbegotten maneuver 
it was a case of a minnow swallowing a whale and nearly 
choking to death on it millstein said the acquisition of 
manhattan industries was almost a total disaster the perry ellis 
name was very costly 
salant unloaded moneylosing portions of perry ellis since the 
1988 acquisition and only retained the profitable licenses 
millstein said in the 1960s salant had a shot at becoming as 
powerful a force in mens wear as levi strauss amp co became with 
blue jeans sales volumes of the two companies were running neck 
and neck 
salant missed its chance by not plunging deeply into denim as 
levi did millstein said

sugar futures prices bounced sharply higher wednesday on new 
yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange after the agriculture 
department predicted world sugar consumption would outstrip 
production for the sixth straight year 
on other commodity markets oil futures fell grains and 
soybeans were mixed livestock and meat were mixed and precious 
metals were mixed 
sugar futures settled 20 cent to 28 cent higher in new york 
with the contract for delivery in july at 1266 cents a pound 
the surge followed the release wednesday morning of a usda 
report pegging world sugar production at 1072 million metric tons 
and consumption at 1095 million metric tons for the marketing year 
beginning sept 1 
harry schwartz a sugar analyst with cargill investor services 
inc said the heavy buying of sugar futures may have had less to 
do with the usda report than with the markets 23 percent decline 
from prices near 16 cents a pound over the past two months 
sugar is on sale he said this is a limitedtimeonly 
getitwhileitscheap type of sugar sale 
sugar futures generally have been sinking since early may 
following forecasts by private trade houses for shrinking 
consumption and rising production 
the recent decline was helped by statements from the soviet 
union indicating it could not afford to buy more sugar cocoa and 
other commodities on the world market 
but with the recent sharp drop in sugar prices speculation is 
mounting that the soviets might find the money to make some 
purchases schwartz said 
energy futures prices continued their downward drift on the new 
york mercantile exchange led by a steep slide in wholesale 
gasoline prices 
weekly statistics released late tuesday by the american 
petroleum institute indicated gas demand is running about 5 percent 
behind last year 
jim fiedler an energy specialist for edampf man international 
futures inc said the selloff in gasoline was the catalyst for the 
markets overall weakness he said brokers are puzzled because gas 
demand is still lagging despite the start of the peak summer 
driving season 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 46 cents 
lower with august at 1668 a barrel heating oil was 04 cent to 
56 cent lower with july at 4793 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 70 cent 183 cents lower with july at 5949 cents a gallon 
nearterm pork belly futures soared the permitted daily limit of 
2 cents a pound on the chicago mercantile exchange largely in 
reaction to a weekly exchange report that showed an unexpectedly 
large drop of 4 million pounds in supplies of bellies stored in 
warehouses outside chicago 
hog futures were supported by stronger cash markets cattle 
futures ended mixed 
live cattle settled 15 cent to 23 cent higher with august at 
7315 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 35 cent lower 
with august at 8420 cents a pound live hogs were unchanged to 35 
cent higher with august at 5892 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 142 cents to 2 cents higher with july at 5915 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago 
board of trade after a late wave of profittaking erased strong 
midday gains in the corn and soybean markets 
susan leighty a grain analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc said the net outcome little change in prices reflected 
traders reluctance to establish new positions ahead of thursdays

transactions involving us firms worth a total of 882 billion 
during the first six months to date down 50 percent in value from 
the 2420 deals worth 193 billion in the first half of 1989 
the figures reflect not only less activity but also lower 
prices for companies since the collapse of the junk bond market 
last fall money to finance deals has been harder to come by and 
prices for businesses have consequently declined 
the firsthalf total includes philip morris cos planned 
purchase of the swiss candy maker jacobs suchard for 38 billion

down during the first half the company reported 3736 transactions 
with a total value of 1877 billion down 39 percent from 4330

the government has accepted a bid from a 
consortium of mexican west german and canadian investors to buy 
the bankrupt cananea copper mine for 468 million barely half the 
original asking price 
the consortium cuprifera cananea submitted the only qualified 
bid monday for the mine and mill in cananea sonora about 100 
miles southeast of tuscon ariz 
the open pit mine operated since 1760 is the largest in mexico 
producing 45 percent of the countrys output mexico is the third 
largest copper producer in the world accounting for 3 percent of 
global production 
the consortiums offer was just above the governmentmandated 
minimum of 450 million and was just over half the 910 million 
value that the government placed on the mine when it first 
attempted to sell it in 1988 
in addition to the purchase price the consortium will assume 
the mines 700 million in debts 
bankruptcy judge sergio higueras disqualified a 600 million bid 
from the mexican company sintemex because the companys 
representative showed up three minutes after bidding closed and did 
not present the required letter of credit or 45 million security 
deposit 
the judge must decide whether cupriferas bid is qualified 
within 10 days before the government can turn over its shares to 
the consortium which is led by mexican tycoon bernardo quintana 
the government took over the mine from anaconda copper mining 
co under the mining law of 1961 which nationalized the industry 
it first put the mine on the selling block two years ago as part of 
a move to privatize state industries 
when 3000 union miners threatened to strike last august over 
contract demands the government declared bankruptcy and sent in 
army troops to close down the mine 
two months later the union accepted a new contract that 
eliminated 200 union jobs and reopened the mine 
the partners of cuprifera cananea are the west german metal 
company metallgesellschaft and the german bank west deutsche 
landesbank girozentrale teck corp a canadian energy and mining 
company and the mexican development company ingenieros civiles 
asociados or grupo ica quintana is chairman of ica

of failed thrifts may be drexels largest creditors he said 
we intend to recover the maximum amount possible for our 
insurance funds and ultimately for the american taxpayer byrne 
said he declined to estimate the amount of the losses and the 
number of sampls involved 
the task force headed by fdic deputy general counsel jack 
smith will consist of 10 to 12 attorneys from the fdic and rtc it 
is aiming for a share of the 350 million set aside by the 
securities and exchange commission for claimants of drexel and the 
400 million set aside for claimants of milken 
drexel which sold investors billions of dollars worth of the 
risky highinterest debt securities known as junk bonds sought 
bankruptcy protection in federal court in new york in february a 
judge scheduled nov 15 as the deadline for bringing claims against 
the firm 
smith said regulators may bring one consolidated claim on behalf 
of the insurance fund or coordinate the filing of separate claims 
for each insolvent institution involved 
the fdicrtc legal group also will be considering possible 
criminal referrals to the justice department concerning milken and 
drexel 
for at least two years federal banking regulators have been 
investigating deals between drexels junk bond operation in beverly 
hills calif and a daisy chain of thrifts that traded the 
bonds among themselves in an alleged scheme to inflate their assets 
among the institutions involved are lincoln savings and loan 
association irvine calif perhaps the nations costliest thrift 
failure with an estimated bailout expense of 2 billion and 
silverado banking savings and loan association denver where 
president bushs son neil served on the board of directors 
the failures of lincoln and other institutions since early last 
year has left the rtc with a 4 billion portfolio of junk bonds to 
sell 
ken lerer a spokesman for milken had no comment on the fdic 
announcement steven anreder a spokesman for drexel said as 
with any other party the regulators will have to present a 
provable claim it will be up to the courts to determine its 
validity 
meanwhile a group of democratic house members proposed creation 
of a special house committee to investigate the scandal 
when congress appropriates money it expects the executive 
branch to manage the programs so that taxpayers money will 
benot lost through incompetence or stolen by crooks said rep 
byron dorgan dnd 
however house speaker thomas foley dwash said he didnt see 
the need to gear up another bureaucracy on capitol hill 
i think the committees of congress presently authorized can 
make the necessary inquiries he said

bell atlantic corp and 
telefonica of spain reportedly submitted winning bids for control 
of argentinas state telephone company 
the sales are critical to argentinas attempt to sell many of 
its moneylosing state companies which employ tens of thousands of 
workers but are criticized for chronic inefficiences 
the sales also have been designed to pare the countrys foreign 
debt argentina is the third mostindebted country in the 
developing world behind mexico and brazil 
bids for entel notorious for its poor telephone service and 
moneylosing operations were opened by the government monday and 
will be announced formally on thursday the company is being 
auctioned off in two sections serving the northern and southern 
parts of the country 
the public works ministry on tuesday confirmed newspaper reports 
that telefonica spains statecontrolled telecommunications 
monopoly submitted the highest bids for both sections of entel 
but the bidding rules do not allow one company to control both 
sections and telefonica chose the southern section 
philadephiabased bell atlantic reportedly was allowed to raise its 
bid slightly and won control of the northern section 
both sections split the buenos aires metropolitan area home to 
nearly onethird of argentinas 32 million residents 
president carlos menem in power since last july has endorsed 
privatizations as a way to prove argentina is serious about 
righting its economic situation but his powerful laborbased 
peronist party has balked at the moves saying too many state 
workers would lose their jobs 
telefonica director enrique used aznar was quoted as telling the 
newspaper la nacion that his company chose the southern sector 
because we think it has greater potential to develop our plans of 
investment and expansion 
bell atlantics representative in argentina carlos joost 
newbery was quoted by la nacion as saying his company increased 
its offer for the northern section above telefonicas to win the 
bid bell atlantics initial offer exceeded that of another bidder 
stet of italy 
in all ownership of 60 percent of entel empresa nacional de 
telecomunicaciones was sold for 214 million in cash and 379 
million to be paid over six years 
the winning bidders also will buy 5 billion in argentinas 
longterm bank debt and overdue interest payments erasing a 
sizable chunk of the countrys 62 billion debt burden 
argentinas debt has been trading at a fraction of its face 
value on the open market the cost to bell atlantic and telefonica 
of retiring the debt has been estimated at somewhat over 500 
million 
ten percent of the new companies will be sold to employees and 
the remaining 30 percent will be sold to the public via the buenos 
aires stock exchange 
public works minister jose dromi said the companies are to be 
privatized formally on oct 8

a debate on the alleged unfairness of the 
savings and loan bailout toward taxpayers in the northeast erupted 
on the senate floor wednesday 
the clash was the first of what some senators warned could 
become an increasingly ugly regional conflict that could spread 
from the thrift bailout to such other issues as housing 
agriculture or defense spending 
in the midst of a seemingly unrelated debate on housing 
legislation northeastern lawmakers sparred with sen phil gramm 
rtexas over reports that states like connecticut new york and 
massachusetts will bear the heaviest burden in cleaning up the 
financial mess in the southwest 
gramm touched off the debate with an amendment to change the 
formula for community development block grants in favor of sunbelt 
states where population is growing rapidly 
the proposal immediately was challenged by lawmakers who 
brandished the sampl collapse as evidence that the northeast already 
is carrying too much baggage for texas and other southern states 
this amendment has the possibilities of creating enormous 
regional animosities of tearing us apart at a time when we need to 
be coming together said sen john kerry dmass 
the senate voted to kill gramms proposal but not before it 
triggered a strong reaction from northern senators of both parties 
sen alfonse damato rny proposed a counteramendment that 
would ensure recipients of bailout money such as texas would lose a 
proportional amount of block grant funding 
damato said congress approved the bailout of the collapsed 
savings and loan industry last year even though most of the money 
would go to a few southwestern states most prominently texas but 
with gramms housing amendment he said the rules have changed 
the citizens of new york will pay taxes to clean up the 
problems elsewhere and be deprived of the economic use of those 
funds damato said worse still the empty office space and 
cheap homes built with sampl money can be used to lure businesses 
away from new york away from connecticut 
gramm shot back that the sampl bailout money wasnt being poured 
into the coffers of the state of texas or its citizens it was 
paying back insured depositors many of them highroller investors 
from the northeast 
he called the idea of using trumped up amendments based on the 
sampl bailout a cute and clever tactic 
to in any way equate the sampl bailout with a formula for 
allocating community development block grant funds a formula that 
in its current incarnation is absolutely unfair is just 
outrageous gramm said im not trying to beat a regional horse 
here 
damato admitted his amendment was more of a symbolic gesture 
than a serious effort at legislation but damato and others said 
the idea of penalizing the southwest reflected a genuine outrage 
over the sampl burden it was placing on the rest of the country 
sen alan dixon dill cited statistics showing the extent to 
which northeastern and midwestern taxpayers will be funneling money 
to the southwest 
texas texas texas dixon bellowed the big winner 
kerry spoke ominously of a farm bill about to come to the 
senate floor with goodies galore for western and southern farm 
states if gramm and others move to tilt other federal programs in 
favor of the sunbelt kerry said the repercussions are going to 
play out as we debate the farm bill 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny threatened to block a 
water resources development bill containing a substantial amount of 
money for texas moynihan chairs a senate subcommittee handling the 
bill

the west german economics minister on 
wednesday urged foreign companies to invest in east germany saying 
they would find a stable market and a bridge to east europe 
helmut haussmann made his statements at a meeting of the 
international chamber of commerce in hamburg as the giant west 
german electronics firm siemens announced it would invest 600 
million in east germany over the next three years 
meanwhile west germany said the last of the borders between the 
two germanies would fall sunday the day the two countries merge 
their economies and east germany sheds 40 years of socialism for 
freemarket rules 
full political union is now expected after allgerman elections 
suggested for early december the germanys after completing the 
treaty on economic merger are now working on one that would iron 
out the consitutional issues 
some experts say up to 4 million people could lose their jobs in 
east germany as industries once supported by the state fail in the 
open market more than onethird of businesses are expected to 
close 
an influx of western industry and goods could help offset the 
falling standard of living experts have said 
haussmann said he hoped the united states japan and all of 
europe would discover east germany which he said offered secure 
market conditions and a stable currency 
western companies have been reluctant to invest in east germany 
during the current political upheaval and transition to a market 
economy 
east german economics minister gerhard pohl also at the hamburg 
meeting said that of the 2000 joint venture agreements east 
germany had signed so far with western companies less than 5 
percent were with nonwest german companies 
in arguing for investment in east germany haussmann said the 
country would be a member of both the european economic community 
and comecon east europes economic equivalent 
east germany is the bridge between the ec and comecon 
haussmann said make use of that bridge if you come too late 
you will miss out 
much of eastern europe has opened to new investment following 
last years rejection of repressive communist rule and subsequent 
democratic reforms 
the announcement by siemens would represent the biggest single 
investment since east germany implemented its reforms the company 
said it would have up to 30000 employees in what is now east 
germany within several years 
siemens manufacturers computers telecommunications equipment 
household appliances and other products the company said its east 
german projects would be in communications data processing energy 
and transportation technology plant automation medical technology 
and environmental protection 
the investment includes previously announced joint ventures with 
11 former government enterprises and a contract to upgrade east 
germanys poor telephone system in six major cities 
siemens spokesman eberhard posner said most new employees would 
be east germans half newly hired and the rest from existing east 
german companies 
in another step toward unification the bonn government said 
that on sunday for the first time germans would be able to travel 
from east to west without border controls 
in bonn government spokesman hans klein said west german 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and his east german 
counterpart petermichael diestel would meet along the border 
between east germany and bavaria on sunday to sign an agreement 
eliminating all frontier controls

south korea has boosted its economic 
growth target for this year to 8 percent to 9 percent up sharply 
from 65 percent previously a government plan said wednesday 
the new target compares with actual growth of 67 percent last 
year when exports the engine of south koreas economic growth 
were sluggish 
the countrys economy grew at an annual average rate of 127 
percent between 1986 and 1988 when exports jumped by more than 20 
percent annually 
the new goal was contained in the economic plan for the second 
half of this year that was adopted tuesday in a meeting of economic 
ministers 
officials at the economic planning board said the upward 
revision was prompted by a betterthanexpected economic 
performance in the first half and an anticipated export recovery in 
the latter half 
the plan said the gross national product was estimated to have 
grown at a rate of 92 percent in the first half mainly spurred by 
strong private consumption and booming construction business 
according to the plan south korea is expected to post a current 
account deficit of 1 billion this year its first shortfall in 
five years the government previously had projected a surplus of 2 
billion for the year 
officials said the economic management plan calls for holding 
down annual price inflation to 9 percent by cooling down overheated 
domestic consumption and curbing hotel leisure and other 
unnecessary construction projects 
korean consumer prices have gone up an estimated 7 percent so 
far this year fueled by excessive demands for construction 
materials connected with a boom in real estate and excessive 
private consumption 
the annual inflation rate stood at 57 percent last year and 
averagd 38 percent in the preceding seven years a government 
think tank predicted two weeks ago that prices would rise 13 
percent this year 
the government plans to peg this years total money supply 
growth at 19 percent to contain inflation officials said

a former vice president of the failed midwest 
federal savings and loan was charged wednesday with violating 
federal regulations in arranging a loan to the coowner of a miami 
resort 
the indictment accuses susan greenwood olson who also is the 
daughter of midwest federals chairman of concealing the nature of 
her relationship with the coowner of the beachfront jockey club 
when she arranged loans for him and the club 
the indictment did not describe the nature of the alleged 
relationship with howard m lorber and prosecutors refused to 
comment beyond the indictment 
the new charges coincided with the appearance of former chairman 
harold w greenwood jr in federal court to face separate charges 
in the thrifts 1989 collapse greenwood and three former top 
executives were charged tuesday with hiding the thrifts losses 
the cost to the government of selling or liquidating midwest 
federal is expected to be about 1 billion 
ms olson was indicted in march on fraud charges involving 15 
million in loans to the jockey club 
prosecutors amended that indictment wednesday to charge ms 
olson with concealing the true nature of her relationship with 
howard m lorber during the same time frame she arranged for 
midwest federal to make over 54 million in unsafe and unsecured 
loans to the jockey club in which howard m lorber owned a sizeable 
interest 
i do not know what the language of that count means said 
olsons attorney mark erickson its just another count why 
they put it in now i dont know 
the march indictment charged that ms olson obtained an inflated 
appraisal of the jockey club to justify excess loans the club 
which owed midwest federal 235 million in february 1989 was sold 
a year ago for about 28 million 
the revised indictment adds robert a mampel greenwoods former 
executive assistant as a codefendant 
the indictment said ms olson also arranged a 400000 unsecured 
personal loan for lorber and an unsecured credit line of 50000 
she was charged with hiding the clear and direct conflict of 
interest 
lorber could not be reached immediately for comment ms olson 
said she is innocent and will fight the charges 
i dont have anything to be ashamed of she said im a 
very typical middleclass person and ive abided by the laws 
im not a criminal she said im going to fight it out 
im doing ok hes greenwood prepared to fight it out as well 
mampel also was charged tuesday with greenwood mampels lawyer 
earl gray said he did not know why prosecutors decided to charge 
mampel in separate indictments 
assistant us attorney hank shea declined to elaborate on the 
charges against mampel 
greenwood and former managing officer charlotte e masica 
appeared briefly before us magistrate j earl cudd mampel 
appeared in an adjacent room before us magistrate floyd boline 
their next court appearances were set for july 3 
a summons has been issued for a fourth former executive donald 
j snede the thrifts former chief financial officer snede is 
scheduled to make his first court appearance july 11 
gray said snede may be cooperating with prosecutors in an 
attempt to work out a plea bargain shea did not comment and snede 
did not return a message left on his answering machine at his home 
neither greenwood nor ms masica talked openly during brief 
court appearances greenwood fidgeted with his hands and 
occasionally whispered to his attorney no pleas were entered 
greenwood is accused of withdrawing 25 million from his 
personal accounts at midwest federal within two weeks of the 
government takeover federal deposit insurance covers only the 
first 100000 in personal accounts

a new truck drivers group is asking 
other truckers to stay off the roads in the united states and 
canada from july 1 through july 4 to protest poor pay and working 
conditions organizers of the proposed shutdown said wednesday 
if the truckers holiday is successful food products will 
be in short supply at grocery stores by july 5 said herman johns 
president of the united truckers alliance and if their demands for 
better pay and working conditions are ignored the bellevillebased 
group wants truckers to stay out until they are met 
we are losing our professional drivers because they cant 
afford to keep driving they must work 90 to 100 hours a week 
said cecilia cece nebgen vice president of uta which was 
formed in february 
the group which says it represents 3000 truckers said that 1 
million of the estimated 27 million overtheroad truck drivers 
are expected to join the effort 
that figure was scoffed at by don tepper spokesman for the 
national private truck council in alexandria va the council 
represents shippers producers and truck carrier companies 
nationwide 
if they expect 1 million drivers to join them then santa 
claus would be leading the way tepper said noting that similar 
calls by other groups in the early 1980s were unsuccessful 
but he conceded that a successful fourday stoppage could leave 
store shelves understocked or bare 
meanwhile in a separate action canadian truck drivers were 
preparing to park their rigs at border crossings at midnight 
thursday to protest government policies in their country that they 
believe are unfair to canadian truckers 
wayne whitney a windsor ont driver who heads a group called 
canadian truckers fighting back said wednesday in the canadian 
capital of ottawa that his group is asking drivers not to cross the 
border 
several border points in ontario and quebec were shutdown 
earlier this month by drivers who say they are being forced out of 
business by us trucking companies 
johns said members of the international brotherhood of 
teamsters which represents about 15 percent of truck drivers were 
expected to join next weeks protest teamsters officials in 
washington did not return repeated phone calls for comment 
half the membership of the uta formed in february is comprised 
of independent drivers and the other half work for shipping or 
other companies johns said tepper said about 150000 of the 
nations truck drivers are independent or socalled 
owneroperators 
johns said truckers are being driven out of the industry by 
increases in operation costs and decreasing paychecks 
truckers havent had a pay raise in 10 years since 
deregulation took effect he said referring to congressional 
action that eased restrictions on the trucking industry in 1980 
tepper conceded pay is low for some drivers 
some owneroperators are making a nice living and there are 
other operators who are earning very little but its a measurable 
minority he said 
johns said the alliance wants all truck carriers and companies 
that ship goods by truck to 
pay company drivers 32 cents per mile and 16 per hour for all 
time spent driving fueling loading unloading and working around 
the truck company drivers are now paid about 20 cents per mile and 
no hourly wage johns said tepper said they make between 20 and 25 
cents per mile 
pay independent drivers 1 per mile for the use of their 
tractor an additional 20 cents per mile if the trailer is supplied 
by the owneroperator and 16 per hour labor johns said 
independents currently make about 80 cents per mile 
tepper doubted truckers would win their demands 
with the competition in the marketplace and with the number of 
drivers that there are those wage and compensation levels couldnt 
be justified tepper said there are people willing to work for 
less 
several drivers a truck stop in troy in southern illinois said 
they planned to join the stoppage 
yeah i plan to stay home greenville pa driver dennis 
bowman said when you look at a paycheck of 500 and youre 
working 110 hours a week it doesnt make much sense 
but chicago trucker ronald thomas said i dont believe in 
shutdowns i dont think it does any good

a new york drug company wednesday began 
recalling a generic drug used to treat high blood pressure after 
the food and drug administration alleged the company submitted 
false information to the agency 
interpharm inc of plainview ny agreed to recall all three 
strengths of clonidine hydrochloride tablets from distributors and 
pharmacies and to conduct an audit of its 24 other products the 
fda said 
the drug comes in small round blue tablets marked ip 47 
routine testing by the fda found that samples of clonidine 
hydrochloride 03 milligram tablets submitted for bioequivalence 
testing by interpharm were not the same as the product on the 
market the agency said 
the tablets interpharm was marketing were blue and in its 
application for approval the company told the fda its tablets were 
blue but the pills that were tested for bioequivalence before the 
drug was approved were peachcolored the fda said 
the agency said it found no manufacturing or production data 
that indicated the company had ever made any peachcolored pills 
the fda said it had no evidence of a safety problem with the 
drug interpharm was marketing but questions whether the product is 
therapeutically equivalent to the brand name drug catapres made 
by boehringer ingelheim 
fda officials advised patients who use the product to consult 
with their physician about switching to another product 
interpharm was one of 20 generic drug companies selected for 
intensified inspections last year in the wake of allegations that 
several companies had falsified documents and cheated on tests 
needed to win fda approval 
the investigation that resulted has produced more than a dozen 
criminal convictions more than 100 drugs have been recalled or 
withdrawn

the state of california sued deposed sampl boss 
charles h keating jr and his accounting firm wednesday in an 
effort to recover 250 million lost on junk bonds sold through 
keatings lincoln savings amp loan 
attorney general john van de kamp contended that arthur young amp 
cos audit of lincolns parent company american continental 
corp deceived the public about the safety of the company 
phoenixbased american continental issued the highyield 
highrisk bonds which were sold primarily to elderly investors at 
branches of irvine califbased lincoln 
if investors had known the truth no one would have invested a 
dime in those bonds keating and company would have been laughed 
out of the market van de kamp said at a news conference but 
with arthur young standing behind them their bonds sold easily 
the bonds became worthless when american continental filed for 
bankruptcy protection in april 1989 
federal regulators seized lincoln the next day they say it may 
cost taxpayers 2 billion to cover the thrifts losses 
van de kamps unfair business practices suit contends arthur 
young and its former partner who audited american continental jack 
atchison should have known the company was losing huge sums of 
money 
instead van de kamp said the accountants vouched for a 
glowing prospectus that said american continental was 
profitable and a good risk 
the states lawsuit follows the lead of classaction suits 
already filed on behalf of the more than 20000 bondholders which 
name as defendants accountants and lawyers for american continental 
and keating 
you go after the people who were paid by keating said john 
dk brunner the chairman of a committee of the bondholders 
keating has very skillfully planned to hide behind his chapter 
11 bankruptcy filing but for those people who profited very 
heavily by him and did his bid and calling the lawyers 
accountants and all those thats the only chance us bondholders 
will ever have of getting our money back 
californias lawsuit filed in state court in orange county 
seeks to recover 250 million from arthur young atchison keating 
american continental and other company officials 
it also seeks penalties of more than 50 million and an 
injunction to stop arthur young from engaging in alleged deceptive 
audits of thrifts 
atchison could not be located for comment earlier this year he 
invoked his fifth amendment protection against selfincrimination 
and declined to testify in a hearing on keatings lawsuit 
attempting to reclaim control of lincoln 
arthur young now does business as ernst amp young its associate 
general counsel eugene erbstoesser said he had not seen the 
lawsuit but he denied any wrongdoing and said the firm had 
conformed to all applicable accounting standards 
keatings attorney james ham accused van de kamp of wasting 
money on lawsuits that can recover no money from his client who he 
said is broke 
van de kamp said arthur young should have detected what he said 
were american continentals fraudulent misrepresentations 
last august regulators who seized lincoln released a report by 
an outside accounting firm kenneth leventhal amp co whom they had 
hired to assess keatings accounting practices 
leventhal concluded american continental used accounting 
gimmickry to inflate its profits 
keatings activities are the targets of several criminal probes 
and federal investigations and a securities fraud suit by 
californias department of corporations 
van de kamp said keating and his associates at american 
continental were running a huge financial con game and sucking 
the assets out of lincoln savings to sustain their operations 
atchison was later hired by american continental at a salary of 
900000 a year four times what he was making at arthur young 
it takes no great insight to understand why he was worth that 
princely sum to acc van de kamp said

the senate on wednesday approved overhauling 
federal housing policies and requiring firsttime home buyers to 
pay more for fhabacked mortgages 
the bill which had languished on the senate floor for nearly 
two weeks was approved on a 961 vote after democrats and 
republicans announced agreement on key provisions with the bush 
administration the only no vote was cast by sen william roth 
rdel 
as passed the legislation would authorize 181 billion in 
federal spending on housing in fiscal 1991 195 billion in 1992 
and 21 billion in 1993 compared with the 145 billion being 
spent this year 
the issue now movesto the house where a competing version would 
cost far more money and take a different approach to restructuring 
often scandalprone federal housing programs that have basically 
gone unchanged since 1968 
many problems still face us dealing with the conference with 
house members over their bill said sen alan cranston dcalif 
but he called the compromise and senate vote an important 
breakthrough that could assure passage of a major housing bill this 
year 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp joined senate 
sponsors including damato and cranston in announcing agreement 
on key elements of the bill 
the administration agreed to authorize spending some 3 billion 
more on federal housing programs next year than president bush 
sought in his proposed budget for fiscal 1991 
in return the administrations socalled homeownership 
opportunity for people everywhere hope program to encourage 
eventual tenant purchase of public housing units was included with 
19 billion over three years 
senate democrats also agreed to accept kemps proposals to make 
home buyers using fha mortgages ante up more of their own money at 
the point of sale as a measure for shoring up the financially 
imperiled program 
under the changes new home buyers with fhabacked loans would 
have to make at least a 5 percent down payment on the purchase 
price and cover at least twothirds of the closing costs out of 
their own pockets without financing 
loans with low down payments deemed most at risk to default 
would also be subject to an added annual fee 
the administration in turn gave senate democrats the housing 
opportunity program hop which would consolidate 10 existing 
housing programs for sending money to local governments to renovate 
or build new housing for lowincome families 
democrats agreed to accept provisions that would allow a portion 
of the money to be spent on vouchers for the poor to use for rental 
housing despite the senates rejection of a similar proposal last 
week 
the senate passed the bill after spending much of the day using 
it as a vehicle to argue about which regions of the country were 
having to spend the most on the savings and loan bailout 
the final hour was spent on debating an amendment by sen jesse 
helms rnc directing negotiators working on a deficit reduction 
package to cut a wide variety of federal programs and subsidies 
before raising taxes president bush on tuesday said a tax increase 
is needed in addition to spending cuts 
helms amendment was later accepted on a voice vote after it was 
watered down to say that the negotiators should consider the most 
feasible budget reduction proposals from a wide variety of groups 
before considering new or increased taxes 
earlier rancorous debate centered on a proposal by sen phil 
gramm rtexas to shift community development subsidies in the 
housing bill from the northeast to texas and 35 other states many 
in the sun belt his amendment would have changed distribution 
formula for the 3 billion in block grants to one based solely on 
population 
the senate voted to table or kill gramms proposal on a 6335 
vote after it triggered a strong reaction from northern senators 
who charged texas and the southwest have benefited most from the 
massive federal spending on covering sampl losses 
the people of new york are going to pay 17 billion for the 
savings and loan bailout said sen alfonse damato rny 
the state of texas gets 59 percent of that why should 
every man woman and child have to pony up money to pay for that 
damato said 
he retaliated with an amendment that would reduce community 
development grants to states with savings and loans institutions 
that have been taken over by the federal government it died with 
gramms amendment 
gramms proposal would have replaced a complex formula now in 
use that places greater emphasis on the age of existing housing 
population crowding the number of people in poverty and the rate 
of growth 
im trying to right a terrible wrong in the allocation of 
money gramm said i dont think new york has any room to cry 
about the allocation of funds texas gets cheated by the 
current formula he said 
according to gramms figures new york would suffer a 95 percent 
cut in its community development money from 302 million to 207 
million other states that would lose money would be hawaii 
illinois iowa louisiana maine massachusetts michigan 
mississippi missouri new jersey ohio pennsylvania and rhode 
island 
texas florida and california would be among the biggest 
gainers each getting an increase of more than 20 million 
three senators did not vote on final passage of the bill they 
were sens edward kennedy dmass william armstrong rcolo and 
claiborne pell dri
