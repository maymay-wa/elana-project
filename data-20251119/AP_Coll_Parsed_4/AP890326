inmates took over a prison farm sunday and 
seized guards and visitors as hostages news broadcasts said with 
as many as five people killed and up to 20 injured 
television station notisiete said easter was a visiting day and 
about 250 prisoners were holding an estimated 400 people hostage 
including guards other inmates and visiting families with children

radio station national broadcasters information patrol service 
reported that at least two guards and two inmates were killed and 
20 people were injured 
neither report gave any indication of the cause of the uprising 
at the pavon prison farm 12 miles east of guatemala city 
the takeover began early sunday afternoon and continued into the 
night local television and radio stations reported 
witnesses said firefighters and red cross workers were seen 
entering the prison with five stretchers 
prison officials and the national police refused to comment on 
the situation 
television newscasts showed the prison farm surrounded by police 
and soldiers sent from the capital an air force helicopter hovered 
overhead 
notisiete said additional army units were on standby 
the national broadcasters information patrol service broadcast 
an interview with a man identified as marcos antonio morales who 
said he and his wife maria were waiting outside to visit a family 
member when the revolt began 
morales told the radio station his wife was among about 20 
people who were wounded in a gunfight between inmates and guards 
he said his wife was taken to a police hospital and he did not know 
the extent of her injuries 
he said he took his wounded wife into a nearby prison chapel 
where many other visitors sought refuge and where other injured 
were being cared for 
reports said officials tried to bargain with prisoners to get 
them to surrender rifles they grabbed from prison guards and then 
most of the weapons were recovered after a gun battle the reports 
said negotiations were continuing 
notisiete quoted fire department cmdr alejandro giammattei 
falla as saying the inmates demanded to talk with federal human 
rights director gonzalo mendez de la riva and that journalists and 
medical workers be allowed to enter the prison

the sweeping esplanade and 
the giant granite cross thrusting up from the surrounding mountains 
dwarf the schoolgirls and conscripts on an outing at the valley of 
the fallen 
the visitors giggle shout and strut they appear oblivious to 
the presence in the crypt behind them of the bones of 40000 people 
who died fighting on both sides in the spanish civil war which 
ended 50 years ago on april 1 1939 
neither the monument built by republican prisonersofwar 
defeated by the forces of gen francisco franco nor the memory of 
the threeyear war itself seem to weigh very heaviliy on the spirit 
of a modern spain 
the government of socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez has 
planned no public observance for april 1 the day a halfcentury 
ago that ushered in a 36year franco dictatorship that outlawed the 
socialist and all other political parties 
socialists communists liberals anarchists masons and 
freethinkers all suffered in the harsh repression that followed 
francos victory which marked the end of his july 1936 uprising 
against the forces of the second spanish republic 
many who fought on the side of the republic perished from hunger 
and ill treatment while hacking away at the granite mountains to 
build the valley of the fallen 30 miles northwest of madrid 
the socialists try to distinguish themselves from the 
francoists by not keeping alive the memory of the civil war 
british historian paul preston explained theres nothing good to 
remember it wasnt really the end it was the beginning of very 
difficult times for many many people 
a member of the friends of former spanish refugees said the 
government had agreed to help with their project to have as many 
indigent elderly exiles as possible return to visit spain this 
year as long as no mention was made of the end of the civil war 
that drove them away in the first place 
jordi corral morales a 21yearold corporal in the armys elite 
brunete armored division knows that franco lies buried beneath a 
plain marble slab in the basilica but he says he could care less 
about the man whose crusade for a righteous rightist spain was 
falling apart by the time the young conscript was born 
the valley of the fallen which franco designed as his final 
resting place has been administered since 1982 by the national 
patrimony in hopes according to some that it will gradually lose 
its fascist connotations and slip into the vast collection of old 
castles and monuments that dot the spanish landscape 
historian javier tusell and culture minister jorge semprun are 
both concerned about spaniards reluctance to confront their past 
and their lack of historical memory 
on the eve of the 50th anniversary and 14 years after francos 
death it is striking that our country which has gone through a 
peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy has not 
however developed a shared historic conscience tusell wrote 
recently in a madrid newspaper 
its not a banal issue he continued because the image 
that a group projects of itself on the past indicates its 
willingness to live in harmony in the present and the future 
pedro alvarez remembers the day 50 years ago when he and a group 
of other 12yearolds joined the crowds in downtown madrid that 
hurried to put out the appropriate flags as the remaining 
republican troops fled and francos victorious nationalist forces 
approached the spanish capital 
we rushed into a barracks the reds had abandoned and stuffed 
our pockets with potatoes and carrots he recalled hunger was 
everywhere in madrid during the war and we were happy it was 
over 
the war didnt really end in 1939 the hardships and 
conditions of war continued well into the late 1940s said 
sociologist amando de miguel people didnt marry very much a 
great sense of depression set in there was a terrible shortage of 
food and then the guerrilla warfare against franco went on into 
the 1950s 
semprun who wrote the screenplay for alain renais 1964 film 
la guerre est finie the war is over as a spanish exile in 
france warned attendants at recent academic conference that spain 
will be in trouble without a historical memory 
to fill the gap many of the countrys leading newspapers plan 
special supplements dealing with the end of the war and its 
relevance today 
and a surprising success of the current literary season has been 
a novel entitled luna de lobos wolves moon by 31yearold 
poet julio llanzamares the sparse tale of three men in the 
antifranco guerrilla movement who try to get to france through the 
mountains of northern spain 
the late spanish historian claudio sanchez albornoz who 
exhorted his countrymen not to forget the civil war wrote that 
during the 193139 second republic spaniards tried to carry out 
religious political and economic revolutions that their european 
neighbors had taken centuries to realize 
french historian pierre vilar says it will be possible to date 
the real end of the spanish civil war to the time when the three 
revolutions have been carried out

the bush administrations heralded plan to 
relieve the staggering third world debt burden faces its first big 
test this week when treasury secretary nicholas brady tries to sell 
the proposal to finance ministers from around the world 
the sales talk will come at the spring meeting of the 151nation 
international monetary fund and world bank the two major lending 
organizations and at a separate strategy session attended by 
officials from the seven largest industrial countries 
the sessions should be lively already the brady plan is being 
viewed as a crucial watershed for the 7year debt crisis which has 
at various times threatened financial calamity for major us banks 
and turned latin america into a political time bomb as struggling 
democracies in the region tried to cope with growing debt 
repayments 
the brady plan as the new initiative is being called seeks to 
encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of the 13 
trillion in debt owed by poor countries in return for guarantees 
backed by the imf and world bank that the remaining pool of debt 
will be repaid 
the new administration received high marks for abandoning what 
many considered to be the failed policies of the reagan 
administration which repeatedly refused to endorse any broadscale 
effort at debt forgiveness 
but critics including many of the largest debtor countries 
complain that the brady proposal does not go far enough especially 
in view of the economic and political pressures building in much of 
latin america 
riots in venezuela last month left more than 300 people dead 
after the government announced a new austerity program implemented 
to please the imf and other creditors who hold 33 billion of that 
countrys debt 
the administration is hoping to come out of the imf and world 
bank session with a general endorsement of the principles of the 
new debt approach when the meetings wrap up on april 4 but many of 
the debtor countries are pushing for quick debt relief to accompany 
the rhetoric 
venezuelas president carlos andres perez has termed the brady 
proposals very timid and officials in that country are already 
saying they may have to defer debt repayments if they dont get 
help soon similar warnings have come from mexico 
some observers say that the brady plan while attempting to 
resolve the debt crisis may initially lead to a greater period of 
instability as debtors balk at meeting obligations on their old 
debt while they wait to see the details of the debt relief packages 
former federal reserve chairman paul volcker who played a 
leading role in the initial us response to the debt crisis in 
1982 has warned that debt reduction could end up hurting both 
creditor and debtor countries if not properly managed 
most observers believe the united states must come up with 
concrete results quickly at least with new initiatives for mexico 
and venezuela or risk more turmoil because of dashed expectations 
it is important that debtor nations not get their expectations 
too high the brady proposal represents measured improvement not 
radical relief said william cline an economist with the 
institute for international economics a washington think tank 
assistant treasury secretary david mulford the key architect of 
the brady plan says the administrations goal is to reduce the 
total debt burden of 39 heavily indebted countries by 20 percent 
over a threeyear period with a similar 20 percent reduction in 
interest payments 
the treasury believes that commercial banks can be enticed into 
writing off a portion of their third world loans by getting the imf 
and world bank to earmark an unspecified amount of funds to 
essentially guarantee the payments on the remaining level of debt 
officials of the lending organizations while generally 
supportive of the brady proposals said they need to see details on 
just how much money they will be expected to put up 
in addition to trying to line up support with the two major 
lending organizations brady faces the task of selling his 
proposals to officials of the worlds largest industrial countries 
finance ministers and central bank presidents of the socalled 
group of seven composed of the united states japan west germany 
britain france canada and italy will hold daylong discussions 
which are expected to focus on the debt plan 
brady used a similar getacquainted session in february to sound 
out us allies to the debt proposal the administration was 
crafting 
based on initial comments many observers expect the bush 
administration will win at least general agreement from the debtor 
and creditor countries and officials at the world lending 
organizations that the us proposals are worth pursuing 
the lessdeveloped countries are now expecting something to be 
done and that means something has to be done said david wyss 
chief financial economist at data resources inc a lexington 
mass consulting firm brady has clearly signalled the direction 
in which things will move

in a new play about menachem begin the 
enigmatic former israeli leader fantasizes about bombing germany to 
retaliate for the holocaust and imagines being mobbed by admirers 
after ending his selfimposed seclusion 
the oneman play was written for the israel festival in may but 
was rejected by festival officials who feared such freewheeling 
treatment of the 75yearold begin was too controversial 
the rejection highlights the ambivalence and strong emotions 
begin still generates among israelis nearly six years after he 
unexpectedly resigned as prime minister and shut himself in his 
twostory apartment at the edge of the jerusalem pine forest 
to the nationalists begin is a sacred man a symbol of 
everything that is pure and good to those on the left he stands 
for everything they despise said ehud sprinzak a hebrew 
university professor and expert on rightwing israeli politics 
begin became prime minister in 1977 the first from the 
rightwing likud bloc to hold the post two years later he signed 
the historic peace treaty with egypt sharing the nobel peace prize 
with president anwar sadat of egypt he resigned in 1983 at the 
height of the war in lebanon 
today begins life is shrouded in mystery frustrating 
biographers and heightening curiosity among israelis 
he ventures outside his apartment for a public appearance only 
once a year to attend a memorial service for his wife aliza who 
died in 1982 
begin breaks his silence rarely usually to comment briefly on 
the radio about history he refuses to discuss his resignation 
commonly attributed to depression over the death of his wife and 
the lebanon war in which more than 600 israelis died 
on sunday begin commented on the 10th anniversary of the 
israelegypt peace accord taking the unusual step of speaking 
about current politics and criticizing the new american dialogue 
with the plo as a negative harmful phenomenon 
he spends his days reading books mostly biographies and 
history said longtime begin aide yehiel kadishai he said begin 
keeps up with news programs reads israeli and foreign newspapers 
and answers several dozen letters a week 
once an avid moviegoer he now watches videos in the evenings 
he likes westerns said kadishai adding that the former prime 
minister also used to watch the american soap opera dallas 
american oil magnate armand hammer offered to donate 750000 to 
begins favorite charity if the former prime minister wrote his 
autobiography but begin has declined kadishai said 
his family aides and friends refuse to talk about begin in what 
israeli journalists have described as a wall of silence 
justice minister dan meridor a longtime friend visits begin 
every friday to talk politics when asked for details about the 
talks meridor balked ive never spoken about my conversations 
with begin 
israeli journalist amnon dankner tried to skirt these obstacles 
and probe the former prime ministers psyche in his oneman play 
titled simply begin 
in one scene begin imagines ending his seclusion people will 
see me and will be amazed he says dreaming of a crowd cheering 
and shouting long live begin 
but then he stops himself and asks what would be the point of 
all those years all the silence the selfimprisonment 
in another scene begin fantasizes about ordering a strike 
against germany in retaliation for the nazi holocaust in which 6 
million jews including begins parents and brother were killed 
on that day bodies would pile up at the entrances of towns 
and squares like they were piled up at the entrances of the 
camps says the begin character 
dankner said he and many other israelis share these revenge 
fantasies adding that begins ability to articulate such emotions 
was at the root of his popularity 
in every israeli there is a little begin he said he 
expressed our fears our nightmares our delusions of grandeur 
even today the mention of begin sparks strong reactions 
during an election rally last fall likud followers listened 
politely to speeches by party leaders but at the mention of 
begins name worked themselves into a frenzy clapping and shouting 
the name of the former leader for several minutes 
but anger toward begin has remained just as strong 
while begin celebrated his birthday last summer a crowd 
gathered outside his apartment including a jerusalem woman whose 
son was killed in the june 1982 lebanon invasion 
this man caused dozens of young men not to reach even their 
20th birthdays said the woman raya harnik in the middle of 
the war he just said he couldnt go on any longer the bereaved 
parents never had such a privilege

after a fiveyear 19 million study the 
internal revenue service has concluded that the average taxpayer 
should be able to fill out form 1040 the dreaded individual income 
tax return in exactly 3 hours and 7 minutes 
but if its past midnight and youre lost in a thicket of 
deductions exemptions credits exclusions and exceptions youve 
got a splitting headache the clock is ticking away and youre 
getting angrier by the minute the irs would like to hear your 
complaint 
this year for the first time irs instructions for more than 
350 tax forms includes an estimate of how long it takes to complete 
each one 
time estimates also appear on the thousands upon thousands of 
forms required by every other federal agency all under a new rule 
issued by the office of management and budget to implement the 
paperwork reduction act of 1980 
the notices also include the name and address of an official to 
contact if someone wants to complain about a form or dispute a time 
estimate 
the idea is that if enough people complain bureaucrats will 
feel pressured to simplify the forms or perhaps to shorten some 
or eliminate them altogether in the interest of easing the burden 
of government paperwork 
altogether the irs says the total time the average taxpayer 
should spend on form 1040 is 9 hours and 17 minutes that includes 
3 hours and 7 minutes of record keeping 2 hours and 28 minutes to 
learn about the form 3 hours and 7 minutes to actually fill it out 
and 35 minutes to assemble the documents copy them and send them 
to the irs 
if the taxpayer itemizes deductions add 4 hours and 34 minutes 
for completing schedule a which lists deductions that makes a 
total of 13 hours and 51 minutes 
the irs man with the stopwatch was james iocozzia a statistical 
researcher who helped develop the computerized timemotion study 
conducted by a private management consultant arthur b little inc 
of cambridge mass 
the exhaustive study which began in 1983 and ended last summer 
included sending 10page questionnaires to 6200 individuals and 
more than 4000 businesses and tax preparers a separate group of 
750 taxpayers kept yearlong diaries recording the time they spent 
on all taxrelated activities such as tossing receipts into a 
shoebox 
when he figured his personal taxes recently iocozzia said i 
kept track of my time spent and i came pretty close to what is 
listed here 
the new omb rule is the brainchild of leon transeau chief 
paperwork manager at the interior department who estimates that 
americans probably spend 127 billion hours a year filling out 
forms for the federal government 
if their time is worth say 10 an hour that means a 127 
billion annual loss to the national economy transeau says 
its such a staggering task he said that the entire us armed 
forces all 22 million men and women on active duty could be 
kept busy all year doing nothing else but completing government 
forms and theyd need an additional halfmillion people to finish 
the job 
this bothered transeau enough to call a meeting of fellow 
paperwork managers in other agencies to talk about it when he 
suggested printing time estimates on every form he recalled the 
room fell silent 
then the bickering began someone protested that blank spaces on 
the forms would be eaten up 
you mean to tell me that we dont want to change federal forms 
to preserve doodling space for the american people transeau 
responded 
if we do this people will write in and complain a fellow 
bureaucrat said then well have to change the damned forms 
thats the idea transeau replied 
he said the new omb rule which he championed over the strenuous 
objections of most federal agencies already has had an enormous 
impact in solving a problem that he believes shackles americas 
competitive strength in world markets 
before anything happens in washington youve got to get to 
the true magnitude of the problem transeau said we now know 
that the paperwork burden is far greater than we reported before 
the irs for example has boosted sevenfold its previous 
estimates of how long it takes taxpayers to complete its forms 
iocozzia says thats because the irs formerly ignored such 
activities as record keeping which consumes 50 percent of a 
taxpayers time 
transeau is still struggling to finish his own tax return before 
the april 17 deadline he laughs ruefully at the new irs time 
estimates 
its taking so long i need professional help he said i 
cant get through it theres no way im going to finish in that 
amount of time

in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

a dispute over cooking oils is heating up as 
farm state lawmakers and consumer groups join ranks on capitol hill 
in what they say is literally a fight for the hearts of americans 
but underlying it all is a battle that has gone on for months 
between agricultural producers the fight matches us soybean 
farmers against foreign palm and coconut growers 
its a symptom of increased international competition that we 
have today for all products says dan reuwee a spokesman for the 
american soybean association 
so far the dispute has produced legislation as well as a war of 
words in advertisements by both sides 
at issue in congress is a proposal by rep dan glickman dkan 
and sen tom harkin diowa to require more nutritional 
information on food packages to help consumers know what vegetable 
oils are used in products and how much cholesterolraising 
saturated fats they contain 
at issue for producers is their share of the 
multibilliondollar us and international markets for edible 
oils which covers everything from salad dressings cooking oils to 
margarine 
according to the agriculture department soybean oil accounts 
for more 70 percent of the edible oils used in the united states 
while the socalled tropical oils palm palm kernel and coconut 
oils represent 4 percent but internationally tropical oils 
dominate and the industry worries that worldwide sales could suffer 
if the current health scare moves overseas from the united states 
the us farm group by its own admission helped start the 
fight by persuading lawmakers to introduce legislation in 1987 
targeting tropical oils as sources of cholesterolraising saturated 
fats 
wed be lying if we said we havent taken advantage of the 
health issue here to market our crop says reuwee but its 
what any good marketing organization does 
palm growers from malaysia the leading producer of the oil are 
striking back with a campaign to promote their product 
we think were getting a pretty bum rap from statements that 
palm oil raises cholesterol when there isnt any evidence 
whatsoever that this is true says john phipps a spokesman for 
the malaysian oil palm growers association 
the latest development came this month when glickman and harkin 
introduced a new version of the legislation the lawmakers 
complained that some products claim to have no cholesterol or 
are made with 100 percent vegetable shortening although they 
contain cooking oils with high levels of saturated fats 
the american heart association which supports the legislation 
says consumers can reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering the 
amount of saturated fat in their diet 
lard is 41 percent saturated fat by weight palm oil contains 51 
percent saturated fat coconut oil 92 percent sunflower oil 11 
percent corn oil 13 percent olive oil 14 percent and soybean 
oil 15 percent 
in general the legislation would require food labels to clearly 
list all cooking oils contained in the product or disclose detailed 
nutrition information including the amount of total fat 
cholesterol and saturated fat 
the previous bill would have required labels to identify 
tropical oils as a saturated fat glickman and harkin dropped 
that provision in an effort to avoid continued opposition from 
tropical oils producers who blocked the original bill by arguing 
it represented an international trade barrier 
however phipps contends the new legislation still will hurt 
tropical oil producers 
it is safe to say that it does not really help their 
predicament forcing a food company to put palm oil coconut or 
palm kernel oil down as a sole source oil probably would be 
somewhat of a deterrent for food companies says phipps 
he contends that negative publicity already has hurt the 
industry in fact a group called the national heart savers 
association led by a millionaire from omaha neb is conducting a 
national advertising campaign against tropical oils using banner 
headlines of the poisoning of america 
already nearly a dozen large food companies such as general 
mills and pillsbury have announced they have stopped or are phasing 
out the use of tropical oils from their products some products now 
carry labels that say they contain no palm or coconut oils 
palm growers have countered with fullpage ads of their own in 
some of the nations largest newspapers decrying the smear 
campaign against tropical oils the industry also has 
commissioned 30 scientific studies including several at us 
universities on the health effects of palm oil 
last year the food and drug administration opposed labeling 
legislation saying tropical oils contribute less than 8 percent of 
saturated fat intake by american consumers in contrast 7075 
percent of saturated fats in us diets come from consumption of 
meats poultry milk cheese butter and eggs

mikhail s gorbachev said on sunday the 
parliamentary election which offered soviets a choice of 
candidates in many cases can ensure democracy while preserving the 
oneparty rule of the communists 
the soviet president spoke after he and his wife raisa voted at 
a goldandwhite building in the lenin hills area that houses the 
national associatedion of soviet chemists and part of the semyonov 
institute of chemical physics 
they chose between boris n yeltsin a popular maverick who 
gorbachev ousted as moscow communist party chief and yevgeny 
brakov the director of the giant zil automobile factory for a 
seat representing moscow in the new 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies 
for a second seat representing their oktyabr region of moscow 
they chose between two relatively young and lesserknown 
candidates ilya zaslavsky a 28yearold scientific worker at the 
moscow textile institute and alexander krutov a soviet televison 
commentator 
gorbachev wouldnt say for whom he voted in either case he told 
soviet and foreign correspondents gathered in a cold mist on the 
steps of the building that he voted for a candidate who was 
nominated 
this is a secret ballot he reminded them 
the president said his policies of pressing for more democracy 
and openness in soviet society while not permitting any legal 
opposition to the communist party are the key to opening the 
potential of our socialist society with the purpose of taking into 
account the various interests of people and harmonizing them on the 
basis of consensus or a majority 
gorbachev said political pluralism is not a panacea for 
solving problems and expressing a plurality of opinions 
despite calls by some protesters for a multiparty system 
gorbachev said he was confident most soviets supported his views 
the communist party has launched an investigation into charges 
that yeltsin advocates a multiparty system which is not permitted 
under the law 
gorbachev said he was satisfied with the election law approved 
in december saying it advanced the political thought and social 
activity of people 
officials knew when they wrote the law that it would need 
perfecting and that the experience of the threemonth campaign 
would help them make corrections gorbachev said but he did not 
say what changes he would support 
gorbachev was not a candidate in sundays balloting having 
already been elected to the new parliament on march 14 as one of 
100 deputies picked directly by the communist party 
voters elected 1500 deputies sunday to represent various 
geographic districts throughout the country for the first time in 
decades soviets had a choice of candidates for many of the seats 
the other 650 were being chosen from the party its affiliates 
social professional and trade union organizations 
gorbachev said he supported competition at all levels of the 
election campaign but saw no contradiction in the partys 
nominating only 100 candidates for 100 seats he said many more 
candidates names were considered before the nominations were 
announced

legislators who passed the nations first 
law requiring instant background checks on people wanting to buy 
certain guns say they hope to end virginias reputation as a 
supplier of firearms to drug dealers 
the deadline for signing the bill is midnight monday gov 
gerald l baliles has said he supports the measure and is expected 
to sign it it would take effect nov 1 
debate on the bill saw weapons drawn in the halls of the general 
assembly 
the sponsor of the measure took a sovietdesigned ak47 assault 
rifle to a senate committee hearing saying he wanted to show that 
dangerous guns can be sold to anyone who has the money sen me 
sonny stallings said the gun was similar to one that was used 
to wound him when he served in vietnam 
the measure awaiting baliles signature is designed to keep 
assault rifles and handguns with barrels 5 inches long or less out 
of the hands of convicted and wanted felons it sets up instant 
background checks on resident purchasers nonresidents may have to 
wait up to a week while the checks are made before they can take 
home a gun 
the system will be similar to that used by merchants checking 
the validity of a credit card gun dealers after checking a 
purchasers identification will call a tollfree number operated 
by the state police in minutes an officer at a state police 
computer terminal will determine if the purchaser has a criminal 
record 
at present in virginia there are no identification requirements 
or other state restrictions on gun purchases gun owners who want 
to carry a concealed weapon need a permit but for others no 
license is required and no registration files are maintained 
washington mayor marion barry referred to the states reputation 
as a gun exporter a week ago when he put some of the blame for his 
citys high murder rate on virginia guns 
the impetus for the measure came in december when a student at a 
school in stallings hometown of virginia beach was charged with 
killing a teacher and wounding another with an assault gun 
the final measure which passed the senate 336 and the house of 
delegates 8115 in february was a carefully crafted compromise to 
satisfy gun dealers gun control advocates and firearms owners 
what we basically have is a winwin situation from the 
standpoint of everyone concerned said raymond w cahen of the 
virginia state rifle and revolver association 
gun owners lobbied for the instantcheck provision because they 
did not want gun buyers to have to wait for days before taking home 
their purchases they also won a provision preventing information 
in criminal background checks from being used as registration files 
gun dealers lobbied to make sure they would not be swamped with 
paperwork the law places most of the recordkeeping burden on 
state police 
advocates of gun control wanted an outright ban on sales of 
militarytype rifles and small handguns but accepted background 
checks as a first step 
state delegate c richard cranwell who wrote most of the 
compromise language said his aim was to fix virginias reputation 
as an exporter of guns to east coast drug dealers 
i want to make sure those people buy their firearms somewhere 
else he said 
charles cunningham state liaison with the national rifle 
association in washington said virginia is the first state to have 
an instant background checks law although the justice department 
is looking into such a requirement nationwide 
cunningham said the nra wants instant checks to replace waiting 
periods or license requirements in states that have such laws

a new coalition cabinet on sunday 
endorsed a tentative peace agreement with southern rebels calling 
for an immediate ceasefire to a sixyear civil war that has 
created a severe famine 
the peace plan was the first act of the cabinet of the warweary 
country 
the war costs the faltering economy 1 million a day and the 
famine has killed hundreds of thousands of southerners 
the peace plan calls for a controversial suspension of islamic 
laws a rebel demand that has kept sudans moslem fundamentalist 
national islamic front from joining a prime minister sadek mahdis 
coalition government which includes all other parties and interest 
groups 
an immediate ceasefire also is called for in the agreement 
information and culture minister hussein abusaleh told 
reporters the cabinet has decided to form a committee headed by 
foreign minister sidahmed hussein to start contacts with the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation organization 
the cabinet has agreed on the peace initiative abusaleh 
told reporters the committee will be in continued session as 
from now to see ways for contacting the rebel movement 
rebels led by col john garang signed the agreement nov 16 with 
the centrist democratic unionist party then the senior partner in 
mahdis cabinet 
it calls for lifting the state of emergency in effect since 
president gaafar nimeiri was overthrown in april 1985 and a 
constitutional conference to negotiate peace 
initially mahdi refused to sign the agreement maneuvring to 
deprive the unionists of credit for reaching a settlement where his 
own party failed 
this prompted the unionists to quit the government in december 
mahdi replaced them with the islamic front 
that move coupled with a successful rebel offensive to capture 
a number of strategic garrison towns led the army to intervene and 
issue an ultimatum for mahdi to resign or form a broadbased 
cabinet to bring peace political parties and trade and 
professional unions supported the armys demands 
mahdi finally complied and after repeated delays swore in his 
new cabinet on saturday 
if the government succeeds in starting peace talks and calling a 
ceasefire it would greatly help an international relief operation 
coordinated to send 100000 tons of food and supplies to the south 
before the rainy season starts may 
the united nations has warned that 100000 to 600000 people 
could die in southern sudan this summer if the operation fails 
garangs rebels have been fighting for economic reforms more 
autonomy and end to the islamic laws decreed by nimeiri in 1983 
they were suspended when nimeiri was ousted in 1985 
but the parliament had been debating alternative laws based on 
the same harsh criminal punishments that include amputating limbs 
of thieves flogging those who drink alcohol and stoning adulterers 
regardless of their religious affiliation

house speaker jim wright seems keenly aware 
that hes walking a fine line in leading the democrats while 
besieged by an ethics committee probe of his personal finances 
if you are unyielding an absolutist youre criticized for 
being a tyrant and if youre cooperative and conciliatory youre 
criticized for being so weak you had to make concessions wright 
mused last week 
the subject was democratic concessions on the minimum wage bill 
but the speakers comment could have applied to any issue that 
comes his way these days 
the ethics investigation places the texas democrat a member of 
the house for 34 years and its speaker since 1987 in the worst 
danger of his political career 
if the panels judgment is harsh he could become the first 
speaker ever forced to resign the leadership post as everyone 
waits for the verdict there is unease among the democrats 
at a news conference friday following announcement of a new 
bipartisan agreement with president bush on a central american 
policy wrights top deputies made a point of praising the 
speakers efforts 
rep tony coelho dcalif the house majority whip grabbed the 
microphones to make sure reporters knew the plan was the direct 
descendent of a 1987 effort by wright wright had stuck to his guns 
despite skepticism even among his colleagues and showed a 
willingness to take the heat to give peace a chance he said 
if the speaker did not take the action at that point we would 
not be here today said rep david obey dwis 
until proven otherwise most house democrats are operating under 
the assumption that wright will be cleared by the ethics committee 
i think the speaker has an enormous margin of waitandsee 
support said rep pat williams dmont although a damaging 
report would be very difficult for the speaker 
my sense is a majority of democrats do not expect the report 
to be damaging but recognize the report will be used by the 
speakers detractors and could be turned into a damaging tool 
said williams one of wrights close allies 
most democrats many of whom were reluctant to discuss the 
matter echoed williams sentiments the party is unlikely to 
abandon its speaker unless the ethics committee which resumes its 
deliberations next month recommends disciplinary action 
if a majority of members thought that a person ought to be 
reprimanded i believe thats inconsistent with the speakership 
said rep barney frank dmass 
the unknown bothers people said coelho the chief 
democratic votecounter but wrights power as speaker has not been 
diminished he said his support is solid i dont see any 
lessening of support 
there has been much less legislative activity in the house this 
year than two years ago when wright first became speaker and had 
an active agenda in this congress wright has repeatedly said the 
house was awaiting an agenda from the president 
two years ago wright was faced with a presidential proposal for 
a congressional pay raise and was able to maneuver so the raise 
took effect this year when a larger raise was proposed wright 
took a political black eye while the raise was killed 
last week wrights most vocal opponent republican newt 
gingrich of georgia was elected the house minority whip gingrich 
said one of the reasons he won was his attacks on wright including 
the filing of the complaint that launched the ethics probe 
to democrats gingrich represents the gops hardline approach 
toward politics aimed at wresting away control of the house for 
the first time in more than three decades 
but curiously many democrats feel better about wright since 
gingrichs elevation gingrich himself is controversial and in a 
leadership position a much better target for the democrats 
it has sort of taken some of the sting out because people can 
go after him coelho said 
rep beryl anthony dark the chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee called gingrich a gold mine 
for the democrats who are threatening to make him a target of an 
ethics probe 
but anthony said he was not sure attacking gingrich would 
provide much political cover for democrats to protect wright 
i think the wright situation is separate and apart and it 
has to be judged on its own merits based on the findings of the 
committee he said

former prime minister menachem begin broke his 
silence on political affairs sunday by using the 10th anniversary 
of the israeliegyptian peace treaty to criticize the united states 
for opening talks with the plo 
begin and the other surviving architect of th historic treaty 
former president jimmy carter praised the pact but expressed 
regret that it did not lead to a comprehensive settlement of the 
arabisraeli conflict 
islamic fundamentalists opposed to the pact assassinated 
egyptian president anwar sadat four years after he signed it 
there were no official ceremonies marking the occasion 
reflecting the chilly relations between the two former middle east 
adversaries mainly over the lack of a solution to the palestinian 
problem 
israeli students did however sponsor a peace party at a 
convention center in jerusalem to mark the occasion of the signing 
of israels only peace treaty with an arab state 
no official ceremonies were held in egypt either and only one 
government controlled newspaper mentioned the anniversary 
columnist anis mansour wrote in the alahram newspaper that 
although arab countries accused egypt of treason when the treaty 
was signed they now agree on the need for negotiations to 
peacefully end the conflict 
israels army radio broadcast interviews with us israeli and 
egyptian politicians and even played egyptian music and hebrew 
peace songs that led the pop charts a decade ago 
the 75yearold begin took issue with washingtons latest peace 
move the us dialogue with the palestinian liberation 
organization in tunisia that broke a 13year american boycott of 
yasser arafats organization 
this is in my opinion a negative harmful phenomenon he 
said in his characteristically hoarse voice the americans our 
friends are in essence asked to reconsider this matter 
begin said he opposed formation of a palestinian state in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip as a danger to israel and the 
entire middle east 
he complained that palestinians persisted in clashing with 
israeli soldiers in the occupied lands and sending guerrillas to 
raid northern israel 
if this isnt terror it is difficult to know what terror 
is he said referring to arafats renunciation of terror and 
recognition of israels right to exist that led to the americans 
opening up a dialogue with plo 
the uprising in the occupied lands is now in its 16th month and 
more than 400 palestinians have been killed in the revolt most by 
army gunfire at stonethrowing youths eighteen israelis also have 
been killed 
referring to the treaty with egypt begin said i have the 
feeling we achieved something very important peace 
begin who shared the nobel peace prize with sadat reportedly 
became depressed over the death of his wife aliza and israels 
losses in the lebanon war he resigned suddenly in 1983 and has 
lived in seclusion ever since 
carter was one of a halfdozen international figures connected 
with the 1979 treaty interviewed on israel radio on the anniversary 
carter 64 applauded the peace agreements survival through 
persistent middle east violence noting especially that it was not 
upset by israels 1982 invasion of lebanon 
both sides have courageously complied with the terms of the 
peace treaty said carter who negotiated the accords at camp 
david in maryland between begin and sadat in september 1978 
the following march 26 the three men signed the israeliegypt 
peace treaty on the white house lawn 
but carter said he regretted that the peace pact did not spur 
other accords with palestinians and israels arab neighbors 
my expectations and hopes and dreams were that building upon 
the principles established in the camp david accords that we would 
see a fairly rapid series of bilateral talks or negotiations 
between israel and her neighbors including the palestinians 
carter said in an interview broadcast on israels army radio 
the camp david accords offered a wideranging framework for 
settling the arabisraei conflict calling on israel jordan and 
egypt to help negotiate a resolution of the palestinian problem 
they called for a fiveyear period of autonomy for palestinians 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip as an interim solution 
before a final settlement was negotiated 
that principle has not changed i think it is still a good 
prescription for the future said carter 
palestinians rejected the plan at the time because it failed to 
guarantee them an independent state or a negotiating role for the 
plo still key issues in the dispute today

yellowstone its image 
hurt by fires starving elk and the slaughter of bison is the 
focus of a highpowered public relations effort to restore the 
gleam to the national park systems crown jewel 
nature is slowly healing the wounds left from the summer of 
1988s forest fires that burned nearly 1 million acres of the 
22millionacre park but yellowstones magical lure is being 
crippled by vivid images of 200foottall walls of flame that were 
projected into americas homes by television last year 
the more sensationalistic coverage led the public to believe 
that yellowstone simply burned up that there was nothing left 
said yellowstone spokeswoman joan anzelmo thats very far from 
the truth the park is open its alive its well 
thick blankets of snow are slowly melting uncovering in the 
park a new landscape in some areas where visitors once could not 
see beyond the green needles on the first phalanx of pines the eye 
can now scan up hillsides of charred tree trunks lining sections 
of the grand loop that circles through yellowstones interior are 
blackened skeletons of oncemajestic lodgepole pines 
but in other areas grass and wildflowers are sprouting along 
with lodgepole seedlings that got their start when the fires seared 
open pine cones scattering seeds 
higher than usual numbers of winter deaths of elk and montanas 
hunting of bison that roam north of the parks boundary have also 
hurt yellowstones image 
park biologists agree some of the elk deaths can be traced to 
starvation stemming from the fire damage but they also point out 
that recent mild winters and lush summers let some elk live beyond 
their normal years and so this years more typical yellowstone 
winter was bound to kill large numbers 
as for the buffalo there are killed when they wander outside 
the park because of the fear they may bring disease to livestock 
yellowstone defenders stress that the park is intended to be a 
natural environment with death and fire as natural as regrowth and 
rebirth 
the very simple solution to all of this would be to put up a 
12foot high cyclone fence around yellowstone national park and we 
can now keep the buffalo in said steve shimek a spokesman for 
travel montana a branch of that states commerce department and 
then we bring in the hay trucks and we feed all the elk and we keep 
them nice and fat and then we put out all the pesky fires 
as a tourism product we compete with a new york zoo said 
shimek montana is not interested in competing with a new york 
zoo montana is interested in competing on the level of a wild 
natural place 
getting the public to understand that concept and return to 
yellowstone is costing wyoming and montana hundreds of thousands of 
dollars 
surveys taken in recent months found that many people said they 
were less likely to come to yellowstone and many tourism counselors 
foresaw a falloff in trips there 
gene bryan director of wyomings travel commission is sending 
media kits to 3000 travel writers throughout the world those kits 
contain a fact sheet on what the fires did and didnt do a story 
on the parks recovery program and an outline of the rehabilitation 
work 
also outlined are the projects the park service is putting 
together to explain the ecological role of fire those projects 
will include an exhibit center and wayside exhibits along 
yellowstones road system that will describe where the fires roared 
and what they did 
also planned are nature trails that will lead visitors through 
burned and unburned areas 
in the weeks to come tv stations in the nations major markets 
will receive videotapes depicting yellowstones rebirth tour 
operators also will be escorted through yellowstone to show them 
the park is still an attractive destination 
the goal behind wyomings decision to spend roughly 600000 on 
the tourism campaign is to reverse the dip in advance bookings for 
the coming season which at one point were running 33 percent 
behind normal for this time of year 
bookings are still down bryan said but theres a 
definite trend upwards

history is repeating itself rather quickly in 
the demand by oliver north that former president reagan come from 
his home in california to testify for north at his criminal trial 
there was a gap of 167 years between the time thomas jefferson 
was subpoenaed and the 1974 summons to richard nixon by then an 
expresident less than 15 years passed before the subpoena for 
reagan 
during the 1974 watergate coverup trial former aide john d 
ehrlichman almost succeeded in his request for nixons appearance 
it would have happened too had the former president not fallen 
critically ill following surgery 
i would have loved to have nixon in court i had a few 
questions i wanted to ask him myself us district judge john j 
sirica wrote in his memoirs 
but at the time a team of courtappointed doctors determined 
that nixon would be in no condition to travel for some time which 
would have delayed the trial i ruled reluctantly sirica 
remembered of his decision that the former president would not have 
to appear i did feel that no matter how anxious many of us were 
to see nixon face the lawyers and testify under oath having him in 
court was not really critical to ehrlichmans defense 
had he gone on the witness stand nixon would have been the 
first expresident to do so under subpoena that dubious 
distinction will fall to reagan if us district judge gerhard 
gesell accedes to norths request 
the debate whether a president must obey subpoenas and other 
court orders dates to the beginning of the republic and it is just 
as volatile today as it was then 
president thomas jefferson received a subpoena in 1807 demanding 
that he turn over a letter sought by defense lawyers in the treason 
case against aaron burr jeffersons first vice president 
burr wanted jefferson to appear in court and testify about the 
letter written to the president by one of burrs alleged 
coconspirators chief justice john marshall presiding over the 
trial declared that the president unlike a king was subject to law 
jefferson cited the independence of the executive branch of 
government from the judicial branch and refused at first to 
release the letter eventually he turned it over but made clear 
that his decision was voluntary and not in response to the subpoena 
from then until watergate the concept of executive privilege 
was never tested no sitting president ever has testified in court 
in a criminal trial although several have provided testimony or 
what might be considered an equivalent 
it is not difficult to see why norths lawyers want reagan to 
testify defense attorney brendan sullivan has attempted to show 
in his cross examination of prosecution witnesses that reagan was 
much more involved in the secret aid to the contra rebels than was 
known publicly before 
the jury heard that reagan personally approved an 
nscrecommended deal in 1985 to give honduras 110 million in 
covert economic and military aid as an inducement to support the 
contras 
the jury also heard that reagan apparently approved a plan from 
north and others in the government to airdrop intelligence data and 
recoilless rifles to the contras for the purpose of destroying 
ships carrying arms to the nicaraguan government 
those actions all were at a time when congress had banned us 
military aid to the contras 
the closest the supreme court has come to ruling on socalled 
executive privilege was in the watergate tapes case of 1974 the 
special prosecutor had subpoenaed the white house for tapes of 64 
conversation and nixon didnt want to give them up 
in the case called nixon v us the court ruled unanimously 
that nixon had to comply with the subpoena the specific need for 
evidence in a criminal case the court said outweighed the 
presidents rights in the matter 
in 1975 president gerald ford gave a videotaped deposition as a 
defense witness in the trial of lynette squeaky fromme who was 
convicted of attempting to assassinate ford lawyers for the 
administration tried unsuccessfully to have the court accept a 
written statement by the president the videotape was played in 
court 
jimmy carter too as president gave videotaped testimony 
twice once was as a government witness in the perjury and gambling 
trial of a georgia state senator the second time he taped 
testimony for a federal grand jury that was investigating 
allegations that fugitive financier robert vesco sought to bribe 
members of the carter administration 
reagan was served with the subpoena while he was still 
president along with thenvice president bush both men sought to 
quash the subpoenas 
attorney general dick thornburgh argued in a jan 13 court 
filing that the summonses raise profound constitutional concerns 
regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by 
a former or sitting president 
he added that the spectacle of a former or sitting president 
being subjected to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign 
governments in the way they deal with the president now and in the 
future 
on the day before the north trial started gesell ruled the 
defendant had not shown that bush had relevant and material 
testimony to give and squashed the subpoena against the new 
president 
but gesell left the decision on reagan open hell probably make 
it this week when the defense starts presentation of its case

disposal of the kind of old dental fillings 
taken from millions of mouths has roy w otts familyowned dental 
supply company battling the environmental protection agency 
at the heart of the epas partiallysettled dispute with otts 
company 58 dentists three other dental supply concerns and three 
individuals is how far the government can reach to hold parties 
accountable for toxic waste contamination 
otts case has aroused attention on capitol hill because some 
lawmakers believe the epa has overstepped its bounds in the name of 
pollution prevention and accountability 
the case hinges on amalgam the stuff that fillings are made of 
and whether it can be considered a hazardous substance after 
it has been removed from peoples teeth 
otts pittsburgh company which sells drill bits and other 
dental equipment says it bought amalgam from its dentist customers 
and sold it to a connecticut metal reclamation business 
amalgam is a hard durable alloy of mercury and silver dentists 
often save old fillings or leftover amalgam and sell it to 
processors who break it down into mercury or silver 
in otts case the epa alleged that he and others sold amalgam 
to metal processor eugene bourdeaudhui between 1969 and 1984 as a 
result of bourdeaudhuis efforts to break the amalgam down the 
agency said soil in willington conn became so polluted with 
toxic mercury that it required a 710000 cleanup in 1985 
in seeking out responsible parties to pay for the cleanup the 
epa stunned the nationwide dental community by going after not only 
bourdeaudhui but also 58 dentists and several dental suppliers who 
did business with him 
the dentists settled last june with the epa which then sued the 
ott dental supply co benco dental supply co of wilkesbarre 
pa a leventhal amp sons inc of scranton pa and smithholden 
inc of providence ri also sued were bourdeaudhui his former 
wife elsie and edward battle an amalgam broker in whitehall 
pa who also did business with bourdeaudhui 
on feb 16 the epa announced that benco leventhal and mrs 
bourdeaudhui settled for amounts ranging from 40000 to 60000 
the other four parties are still battling the suit 
otts son kenneth 36 said it is difficult for him to grasp 
that his familys firm which has six fulltime employees has 
ended up in a federal court case about dental fillings 
its a question of liability and how far it can go the 
younger ott said you can break water down into hydrogen and 
oxygen the hydrogen could explode and the oxygen could feed the 
fire 
ott said the epa suit which is being heard in a federal court 
in hartford conn could wipe out the business that he had hoped 
to take over from his father 
the fact that dental amalgam is considered a hazardous waste 
under superfund comes as a surprise to many said rep doug 
walgren dpa in a recent letter to epa a substance which is 
in my mouth and the mouths of millions of americans and is 
deemed safe by dentists and the american dental association 
hardly seems a candidate for superfund coverage 
sen john heinz rpa also wrote the epa last month saying he 
feared the case could discourage recycling by dentists 
the precedent of making recyclers of products liable for the 
hazardous byproducts of a recycling process that is not directly in 
their control creates a major disincentive for recycling heinz 
said 
but the epa said the case should make dentists and dental 
suppliers more responsible 
in announcing the settlements last month epa regional 
administrator michael r deland said the agreements demonstrate 
that members of the dental community understand that they have a 
responsibility to make themselves aware of dental amalgams 
ultimate disposal method and that the dental community which 
controls the disposition of waste amalgam rather than taxpayers 
should bear the cost of cleanup

the bush administration is reviewing the need 
for tougher us curbs as well as expanded international 
cooperation to help block the export to third world countries of 
chemicals and equipment for making poison gas weapons a commerce 
department official said sunday 
paul freedenberg undersecretary of commerce for export 
administration said the steps could include new legislation or at 
least bolstered regulations for enforcing current export control 
statutes 
were reviewing the strengthening of controls he said 
noting that the policy review was being handled primarily by the 
state and commerce departments with some input from the central 
intelligence agency 
freedenberg said he expects the review will be completed in the 
next few months 
most likely we wont need legislation we just need further 
regulation he said and more importantly i think its likely 
that well be looking for international cooperation 
freedenberg said the united states and 16 other industrialized 
nations have pledged to prevent the export of critical poisongas 
chemicals and manufacturing equipment to four problem countries 
iran iraq libya and syria 
but there are other mainly third world countries he said which 
are believed to be interested in developing a chemicalweapons 
capability 
you have a country such as egypt which is right next door to 
libya and obviously has a concern about libyan capacity to make 
chemical weapons where there are no controls whatsoever on that 
type of equipment or those chemicals freedenberg said 
other countries which either have poison gas or are developing 
the capability of making it include israel india pakistan burma 
north korea taiwan china and ethiopia 
if you want to have a comprehensive worldwide regime you 
have to have a regime that controls both the precursor chemicals 
and the equipment to make chemical warfare agents to all the world 
outside of the united states and the other 16 members of the 
australia group freedenberg said 
the group of industrialized nations is so called because it was 
formed at a meeting held at the australian embassy in brussels in 
1985

during the 198788 election cycle the 
republican party raised and spent more than double the amount of 
money taken in and spent by the democrats but the gap between the 
two parties financial strength was less than in 198384 the 
federal election commission said sunday 
a report issued by the commission said the gop raised 2633 
million and spent 257 million in 198788 compared to 1279 
million raised and 1219 million spent by the democratic party 
by contrast when president reagan ran for reelection in 
198384 the republicans raised a record 2979 million and spent 
3008 million while the democrats raised 985 million and spent 
974 million 
in 198788 the two parties were more closely matched in terms of 
socalled coordinated expenditures monies spent on behalf of 
federal candidates in the general election but not directly 
contributed to their campaign coffers coordinated expenditures by 
the gop totalled 227 million 27 percent more than the democrats 
179 million 
the democratic party figure was nearly double the 9 million 
spent in coordination with general election campaigns in 198384 
while coordinated expenditures by the republican party rose only 13 
percent from the 201 million reported in the earlier twoyear 
period 
during the most recent election cycle direct contributions to 
candidates totalled 34 million for the republicans and 17 
million for the democrats the fec said 
it reported that of the gops total 198788 receipts 87 percent 
came from individuals 3 percent from state and local party 
organizations 1 percent from political action committees or pacs 
and 9 percent from other sources for the democrats the breakdown 
was 68 percent from individuals 6 percent from state and local 
parties 8 percent from pacs and 17 percent from other sources

washington state has found a hangman 
to execute a prisoner who walked away from a workrelease program 
to extract vengeance against a woman who testified against him 
after he assaulted her years earlier 
if charles rodman campbell goes to the gallows thursday morning 
as scheduled it would be the first hanging in the nation since 
kansas executed four men in 1965 including richard eugene hickock 
and perry edward smith whose story was told in the truman capote 
book in cold blood 
the execution of campbell 34 for the brutal 1982 slayings of 
renae wicklund her daughter and a neighbor would be the states 
first in nearly 26 years 
campbells last avenue of appeals was to begin monday in the 
us district court in seattle but federal courts have turned him 
down in the past his final statelevel appeal ended last week when 
the supreme court of washington denied campbells request for a 
stay of his execution scheduled for 1201 am thursday 
barring a stay campbell will die by hanging in the 
highceilinged execution chamber at the washington state 
penitentiary unless he decides to choose lethal injection of 
drugs which he has so far refused to do hanging is washington 
states official form of execution although a prisoner may opt for 
injection 
a bill that would ban hanging and make lethal injection the sole 
method of execution in washington is stalled in a legislative 
committee 
only three other states montana delaware and new hampshire 
still have hanging as their official form of execution though none 
has carried out a hanging in at least 40 years 
in his appeal campbell argued that his rights were violated 
when he was allowed to miss the jury selection process even though 
it was at his request he also claimed he must serve prior 
sentences before being executed and that the states decision to 
have two methods of execution violates his right to religious 
freedom because he is forced to make a choice in his own death 
defense lawyer al lyon said he plans to use basically the same 
appeal in federal court packaged a little differently 
campbell was convicted of leaving an everett workrelease center 
on april 14 1982 and going to the clearview home of ms wicklund 
31 whose testimony about a prior attack had sent him to prison for 
sodomy and assault in 1974 
she was severely beaten her throat was slashed and she was 
raped with a blunt instrument 
her daughter 8yearold shannah had her throat slashed so 
violently she was nearly decapitated a neighbor barbara 
hendrickson 51 came to the wicklunds house during the murders 
and also had her throat slashed 
because hangings are so rare in the united states state 
department of corrections officials had difficulty finding a 
qualified executioner said rich bauer penitentiary spokesman 
prison director larry kincheloe said the executioner was hired 
in the united states for 1500 corrections officials are keeping 
the persons identity secret prompting the american civil 
liberties union to ask for public records to prove the 
executioners credentials 
state and prison officials have said little about their 
preparations for the execution hoping to avoid the carnival 
atmosphere that accompanied the recent execution in florida of 
another washington state resident ted bundy 
were trying to keep this as lowkey as possible we dont 
want a circus like bundys execution said dick milne 
spokesman for gov booth gardner 
opponents of capital punishment are gearing up for 
demonstrations against campbells pending execution 
it is a gruesome business said teresa mathis seattle 
coordinator of the washington coalition to abolish the death 
penalty im appalled we would put so much energy into doing it 
demonstrations or candlelight vigils are planned at walla walla 
seattle spokane and the state capital at olympia she said 
prison officials planned to beef up security around the prison 
and to designate separate areas in a parking lot to keep opponents 
and supporters of the death penalty apart bauer said 
campbell has had two previous execution dates postponed while 
his appeals made their way through both state and federal courts 
the us supreme court refused to hear an earlier appeal 
prison records indicate washington state executed 73 prisoners 
by hanging some two at a time after taking over the duty from 
counties in 1904 the present gallows were built in 1938 
chester j self convicted of murder in the slaying of a seattle 
taxicab driver was the last to die here in june 1963

producer allan carr says wednesdays academy 
awards will be the best show ever but despite the hype oscar 
can easily be upstaged by the hollywood sideshows sharing the bill 
each year 
whos wearing what and with whom the evenings five ws have 
been known to steal the show from the golden statuettes that come 
later as arriving celebrities ritualistically alight from their 
lengthy black limos 
on the party scene the academys official governors ball is 
generally a staid affair and oscar winners usually make only 
obligatory appearances before heading to private parties 
but this year many stars will party while watching the awards 
on television 
it is very fashionable this year to say im not going to the 
oscars said celebrity insider susan price who is also a public 
relations consultant for beverly hills hair stylist umberto 
superagent irving swifty lazar will throw his annual oscar 
soiree at the posh eatery spago with dozens of celebrities 
expected to gather there to watch the awards on television those 
expected include jeff bridges glenn close joan collins michael 
douglas and jane fonda 
the citys no 1 celebrity of late former president ronald 
reagan turned down an invitation to lazars party to watch the 
awards with wife nancy at their belair home said spokesman mark 
weinberg 
actress elizabeth taylor will hold a private gettogether to 
watch the oscars show and ernest and tova borgnine will cast mock 
ballots with friends during a private party in their beverly hills 
home 
other mockers will gather at the palace club in hollywood the 
scene of the golden raspberry foundations annual oscar spoof 
ceremony which this year will be held simultaneously with the 
academy awards 
guests will dine on a potluck dinner while viewing the real 
oscar show on a largescreen tv presentation of the plastic 
razzie trophies which honor the worst in entertainment will 
be made during commercial breaks 
the oscars ceremony may not be the only game in town wednesday 
but it could be the most expensive a complete academy awards 
evening can range from 1800 to 15000 per person 
a seat at the shrine auditorium ceremony costs 150 the 
governors ball runs 450 its 500 for a stretchlimousine 
tuxedo rental is about 70 and designer gowns range from 1200 to 
12000 
carr who hired designers ray klausen and fred hayman to spiff 
up the oscar show said the awards will be big glitzy and 
nostalgic more like a broadway play than the annual parade to the 
podium 
the trend this year will be dropdead chic entrance gowns 
said hayman the idea this year is a return to great glamour the 
hollywood of the past the public looks to hollywood for glamour 
he promised a lot of wonderful beading on the gowns 
two celebrities can particularly be expected to have the look 
that might make someone drop dead cher can usually be counted on 
to expose her navel and actressmodel edy williams habitually 
steps out of a limousine wearing not much of anything 
last year miss williams the libidinous super vixen in beyond 
the valley of the dolls arrived with a stuffed puppie on her 
shoulder and doves on her head but her revealing costume drew more

after years of watching their right to 
light up slowly whittled away smokers are about to get some relief 
from the maryland general assembly 
the legislature is nearing enactment of a bill that would make 
it illegal for employers to refuse to hire someone because that 
person is a smoker both the house and senate are on record as 
supporting the measure making it likely a bill will be sent to the 
governor before the legislature adjourns april 10 
gov william donald schaefer has not taken a position on the 
issue 
bruce c bereano lobbyist for the tobacco institute said he 
knows of no other state that has a similar law although the 
virginia legislature voted this year to prohibit discrimination by 
state and local governments against smokers 
identical bills introduced in the maryland house and senate go 
much further than the virginia law covering all private employers 
as well as public agencies an employer could not refuse to hire or 
promote a worker or fire him simply because that employee smokes 
when he is not at work 
sponsors of the two bills say they deal with freedom and 
individual rights not smoking dismissing the arguments of 
opponents who say employers have a right to try to reduce the costs 
associated with smoking 
i just see this as a right that people have to perform legal 
acts in their homes as long as it doesnt jeopardize their job 
performance delegate george w owings iii said friday 
the maryland legislation was prompted in part by a policy 
adopted a year ago by the montgomery county fire and rescue 
services the suburban washington dc county makes new employees 
sign an agreement that they will not smoke on or off duty as long 
as they work for the department 
owings whose district is in the tobacco growing region of 
southern maryland said he wonders what will come next if employers 
can get away with telling people they cant smoke 
will they tell you that you cant watch channel 9 you can 
only watch channel 11 between the hours of 10 and seven you cant 
read the baltimore sun 
what are they going to take away next owings asked 
if you want to take it to the extremes an employer say a 
tobacco company could say if you want to work here you have to 
smoke he said 
sen albert wynn sponsor of the senate version of the bill 
said he has seen newspapers ads offering jobs only for nonsmokers 
showing that the montgomery county agency is not the only employer 
to penalize smokers 
this is discrimination and it ought to be a prohibited act 
wynn said 
opponents of the bill argued in committee and during floor 
debate that employers have a legitimate interest in whether their 
employees smoke because smokers have more health problems 
resulting in higher health insurance costs 
wynn said if employers can discriminate against smokers on the 
basis of higher costs they can move on from there to discriminate 
against overweight people and people with high blood pressure

laotians voted sunday in the first 
national election since communists seized power 13 years ago 
officials called the balloting a step toward socialist 
democracy but said it would bring no policy changes 
citizens of this impoverished southeast asian nation chose 
members of the supreme peoples council the highest state body 
officials said 121 candidates about twothirds of them communist 
party members were running for the 79 seats 
after the elections there will be no political changes 
acting president phoumi vongvichit told reporters at a polling 
station dismissing foreign reports of major leadership changes 
policy and direction remain unchanged said phoumi who 
turns 80 next month 
at another polling booth 68yearold premier kaysone phomvihane 
boasted the people wont let me quit i am still the prime 
minister 
kaysone said a new government will be formed in about 18 months 
after the newly elected national council drafts laos first 
constitution 
kaysone and phoumi helped lead the decadeslong communist 
guerrilla struggle against french colonial rulers and then the 
americanbacked government during the vietnam war kaysone has been 
premier since december 1975 when the communists won power and has 
led the party since cofounding it in 1955 
hundreds of people were lined up at polling stations at schools 
temples and government offices in the capital by the time polls 
opened sunday 
many voters appeared confused some turned in unmarked ballots 
and one 70yearold grandmother asked a foreign reporter to mark 
hers officials said voting was not compulsory but some citizens 
said they voted because they were not convinced there would be no 
penalty 
at temples where foreign reporters were taken many voters 
marked their ballots in open view many said they knew nothing 
about the candidates 
the council comprised 45 appointed officials when it was 
established in 1975 
among laos 38 million people about 18 million aged 18 years 
or older were eligible to vote results from the 4153 polling 
stations were to be counted by hand which could take a week to 10 
days 
when polling ended in the evening 10 officials at one polling 
station sat in a ring and turned a ballot box upside down and 
dumped ballots on straw mats they marked the tally on a chalk 
board turnout at the station was more than 98 percent they said 
kaysone said the polling was very important the election 
enlarges peoples democracy in a genuine way and encourages debate 
on who wants whom in the supreme peoples council who is good who 
has the qualifications 
but some foreign analysts called it mainly an attempt to

the head of the food and drug administration 
said sunday that investigators have narrowed the search for those 
responsible for injecting cyanide in two grapes imported from chile 
while offering no indication that officials necessarily expect 
to make an arrest fda commissioner frank young said the incident 
which prompted the removal from us grocery shelves of all produce 
from chile could result in prosecution under us laws 
we dont have the exact person who would have done it but we 
do have a lot of information and we can trace back with a paper 
trail to the small producer where this particular crop came from 
young said on the nbc television program meet the press 
we do not know who did it but the person would come under 
the us laws of tampering and tampering is subject to multiple 
years in jail and major tens of thousands of dollars of fines 
said young 
he also defended government action in removing chilean products 
from the us market for several days while intensified inspection 
techniques were worked out with chilean officials and acknowledged 
that there will never be a 100 percent guarantee against such 
tampering in the future 
young said it is crucial for individual consumers to play a 
large role in insuring their own safety by inspecting the fruits 
and vegatables they eat 
when you look at it the us government does one part the 
exporting country does another part the consumers do a third 
part said young 
is visual inspection by a consumer really an effective way to 
reduce risk 
yes it is young replied in the case of fruit you 
should be able to if it is injected in see the needle site and 
see the particular softening at that point its also important 
that in the large fruits like apples to look at the stem and 
blossom areas 
young who also headed fda during the cyanide poisoning of 
overthecounter pain medication in chicago several years ago said 
there are almost always visible signs of tampering 
what i was impressed with is when we looked at all of the 
tampering that weve gone through that even with medicines when 
capsules were involved any consumer that had looked at the dosage 
form would have seen that the capsule was tampered with said 
young 
he denied any suggestion that his call for increased consumer 
awareness amounted to the agency shirking responsibility 
id say that we have with the resources at hand moved these to 
meet a variety of crises and we can do that quite well said 
young on the other hand we cannot do 100 percent safety in the 
case of this inspection we had to do a random sampling that we 
then with a probability a statistical probability say that weve 
got the maximum feasible safety that can be done through 
inspection

three months after he was convicted of 57 
counts of securities credit card and mail fraud a man once 
considered a teenage business genius returns to court monday to be 
sentenced 
a prosecution sentencing memorandum asked for a sentence of at 
least 25 years behind bars for barry minkow saying such a term was 
more than justified for the 22yearold man 
us district judge dickran tevrizian could sentence minkow to 
up to 300 years but defense attorney david kenner has said that is 
unlikely and was expected to argue for a much shorter term than 
the government recommendation 
barry is a young man kenner said after his client was 
convicted i would hope barry will still be a young man when he 
is released 
minkow who was 16 when he launched his zzzz best carpet 
cleaning company in his parents garage has insisted he was a 
captive of mobsters who took over his company and forced him to 
commit fraud 
the government claimed he was a shrewd con man who convinced 
wall street investors and tv talk show hosts that he was a business 
genius 
he sold investors on a business which for the most part did 
not exist said assistant us attorney james asperger who said 
minkows manipulations cost investors over 25 million 
the collapse of zzzz best rocked the volatile us money markets 
and exposed the vulnerability of major securities firms and banks 
which bought minkows sales pitch and committed millions to his 
company 
the keystone of minkows scheme devised with a number of 
associates was a claim that zzzz best was making a fortune 
restoring water and firedamaged buildings investors were taken 
on tours of alleged restoration projects in abandoned buildings 
with which zzzz best had no connection 
at the height of his fame minkow lived in a 1 million house 
and drove a ferrari but he claimed he actually was living a 
nightmare of fear as gangsters moved in on his empire 
i was just a front man for the mob he testified at his 
trial i was just a puppet 
it became clear at the trial that minkow had dealings with such 
mob figures as the late jack catain the defense presented evidence 
that los angeles police had investigated mob infiltration of zzzz 
best but the judge limited such testimony and jurors rejected the 
claim that minkow was a hostage of the mob

prime minister margaret thatcher leaves for africa 
monday on a tour aides describe as a diplomatic push to launch a 
peace initiative in southern africa including a political 
settlement in south africa 
the weeklong trip to morocco zimbabwe and malawi with a 
stopover in nigeria underlines mrs thatchers transformation from 
being in the mid1980s the focus of african resentment over what 
black states see as western footdragging over south african 
apartheid 
this is the beginning of an initiative said a senior 
british government source speaking on condition on anonymity 
but how far it will go is anybodys guess at the moment 
zimbabwe president robert mugabe once an outspoken critic of 
mrs thatcher for her refusal to impose tough sanctions against 
south africa is planning a warm welcome for the british 
conservative party leader 
it is her first visit to the former whiteruled rhodesia which 
britain steered to independence in 1980 and to malawi another 
excolony 
south african foreign minister pik botha who held a surprise 
meeting with mrs thatcher at her invitation in london on march 15 
indicated before the trip that she could play a pivotal role in 
southern africa 
con botha a spokesman for south africas governing national 
party said in a british broadcasting corp radio interview that 
south africans have the highest regard for mrs thatchers 
antisanctions stance 
we also think she is in a particularly good position to 
influence african states she is going to visit now to adopt a more 
pragmatic attitude toward developments in southern africa he 
said 
mrs thatcher may try to build on recent agreements under which 
sovietsupported cuban troops will withdraw from angola and 
unsupervised elections will bring independence to namibia 
in zimbabwe mugabe will likely reiterate demands for britain to 
impose tough embargoes against south africa a major trading 
partner 
talks in zimbabwe and malawi are expected to focus on new moves 
to end the civil war waged in neighboring mozambique by renamo 
rebels and on the implementation of the namibian peace settlement 
mrs thatcher denied published reports she plans to organize a 
southern african regional peace conference but said britain will 
help if asked

frenchborn jack pointeau did it right 
which was wrong 
he entered this country legally so he must leave had he 
entered the country illegally he could stay now it is too late to 
become an illegal alien and stay so he really is an illegal alien 
and must go 
dont laugh jacks not nor are his wife and four children or 
their friends or the townspeople 
this is a catch22 bureaucratic boondoggle said donny 
brown editor of the snyder daily news 
some call it the french fiasco 
after selling their small threestar hotel in paris the 
vacationing pointeaus entered the united states in 1981 on tourist 
visas they liked what they found in 1982 they obtained an 
investors visa and bought a motel in the san franciso area 
when his night clerk was slain pointeau sold the motel and 
moved his family to this west texas oil town of 12000 the 
pointeaus purchased a 50 percent interest in a motel for 212000 
pointeaus wife francoise and the couples four daughters became 
honor students in school pointeau joined the rotary club 
now the family must sell or surrender their motel and pack up 
their possessions the us immigration and naturalization service 
in the fall told pointeau 52 that the family will be deported by 
april 26 
ins officials pointed to a series of alleged shortcomings but 
the most critical seemed to be that pointeaus investment was not 
substantial and that his enterprise was marginal 
the regulations do not define what is substantial the ins 
conceded but the agency noted that some consular offices use 
250000 as a point of departure 
pointeau said he appealed to the lubbock immigration office for 
help but was told there is nothing we can do for you because you 
are legal 
rep charles stenholm a texas democrat introduced legislation 
designed to rescue the family but got only a polite rebuff and a 
concession that immigration laws need changing 
referring to the recent pardon for many illegal aliens stenholm 
aide marc lubin said whats ironic about this is that if he had 
not been here legally if he had not renewed his visa each time he 
would have been granted amnesty 
attorneys say the pointeau affair may not be all that uncommon 
in the wake of a recent gettough edict by immigration officials 
in september a petition circulated in snyder protesting the ins 
action picked up 1837 signatures earlier this month a citizens 
group pledged 3000 to retain an attorney and pay filing fees for 
a lawsuit to delay deportation 
now i know what is the spirit of texas pointeau said last 
week in his disjointed english which he speaks with a lilting 
french accent 
when pointeau headed for snyder and bought a stake in the motel 
the town was riding the crest of an oil boom even after the boom 
went bust pointeau dutifully renewed his investors visa each year 
and kept his motel afloat with hard work and modestly successful 
outside business ventures 
meanwhile the four children who now range in age from 13 to 
21 were excelling at school 
so was mrs pointeau who graduated with high honors from a 
nearby college and is on the verge of obtaining a masters degree 
in french literature she will not be able to graduate if we have 
to leave pointeau said 
year after year it became fact that we all were living in 
america and that the children were receiving an eduation for a 
future life in this country pointeau said after having lived 
here for years we all started dreaming about becoming us 
citizens 
easy to say tough to accomplish 
after years of temporary visa renewals the immigration office 
in dallas notified pointeau that another extension was being denied 
friends believe pointeau can buy more time with the federal 
lawsuit 
we wont let this die said restaurant owner randy perkins 
this is a great cause to fight for

threeyearold sashas parents leaned down and 
asked the young muscovite attired in a snowsuit who is his favorite 
candidate yeltsin their son exclaimed 
most adults voting at moscow polling station no 74 were as 
definite about their choice and optimistic about what sundays 
multicandidate elections mean i think the quality of our leaders 
will improve because now we have a real democracy said dr 
valentina agababova as she sat on a windowsill and crossed out 
names of candidates she was voting against previously the 
communist party allowed only one candidate for each seat 
once upon a time wed just take the forms and throw them into 
the ballot box now for the first time were really voting she 
said 
the choice for the moscow city seat between maverick communist 
boris n yeltsin and his opponent automobile factory director 
yevgeny brakov seemed clearcut of 50 voters interviewed around 
moscow on sunday 42 said they voted for yeltsin naturally 
said one only two said they chose brakov 
but at polling station no 74 in southern moscow a separate 
district race slowed the process 
a small line formed before redcurtained voting booths and 
voters decided between a dozen candidates for the new congress of 
peoples deputies including a television commentator a professor 
of philosophy a renowned military historian and a cosmonaut 
candidates have wooed voters over the past two months through 
election meetings and television appearances as soviets made their 
choice the state media went into high gear but they offered bland 
fare by us standards lacking the pizazz of hightech us 
network coverage absent were early returns from the soviet far 
east where the polls closed two hours after polls opened in 
moscow complete election results are not expected until april 5 
many soviets however said television was indispensable in 
helping them make their choices 
i decided who to vote for in my local election as a result of 
the televised debates my choice seemed more intelligent and had a 
more pleasing face i guess its the same reason many americans 
voted for reagan said a 37yearold moscow woman who declined to 
give her name 
in the televised debates as they were called candidates 
gave speeches or answered reporters questions they seldom engaged 
in exchanges with their rivals 
a poll published saturday showed 38 percent of 2000 respondents 
to a questionnaire in moskovskaya pravda newspaper criticized the 
media for lack of depth 
poll results published saturday by the newspaper left out what 
westerners would consider the main question which candidate will 
you vote for 
the newspaper said 85 percent of respondents did want to give 
their choice but it would have been tactless to assess the 
chances of candidates a day before the election the communist 
party newspaper said

irans navy hijacked an arab tycoons 
yacht with five members of kuwaits royal family and four britons 
aboard and was holding them for ransom news reports said sunday 
government information officers in kuwait bahrain and other 
gulf states said that they had no information about the incident 
which reportedly occurred thursday 
independent television news in britain quoted diplomatic sources 
in kuwait as saying the four britons are young women who were 
aboard the 82foot yacht owned by kuwaits alsabah royal family 
the report said the yacht apparently was seized for ransom after 
it strayed into a sensitive area near irans northern farsi island 
it said officials leaked information to the kuwaiti newspaper 
alanbaa because irans revolutionary guards are demanding a ransom 
and negotiations between kuwait and iran are going badly 
alanbaa first reported the story saying the yacht had come 
from france and docked briefly at bahrain before leaving thursday 
six hours after it sailed for kuwait a distress signal was picked 
up said the paper 
officials at bahrains leading yacht club the marina club said 
their registers showed a distress signal issued thursday 
a man speaking english with an arabic accent said my yacht is 
burning what can i do according to a club official the caller 
did not respond to a request for his location 
alanbaa identified those aboard the yacht only as royal family 
members from an unidentified persian gulf nation and four britons 
the newspaper said it had names of all those aboard but would not 
publish them to avoid affecting the secret contacts going on with 
iran at the highest levels to end the incident 
in london britains foreign office said it was the first it had 
heard of the report weve asked our embassies in the region but 
they know nothing about it said a spokesman on condition of 
anonymity 
shipping executives speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there were at least two cases in recent months of pirates 
seizing vessels in the northern gulf 
they just turn over people aboard to the nearest fishing boat 
and seize the boat said one of the sources 
the pirates most likely are iranian the sources said 
alanbaa said the yacht probably is at farsi 
the island was used as a base for gunboats manned by 
revolutionary guards during the 8year gulf war the gunboats were 
used to attack oil tankers and other merchant traffic in gulf 
shipping lanes 
kuwait was one of iraqs largest financial backers during the 
war and registered 11 tankers in the united states because iran 
made its shipping a target this prompted a large us navy buildup 
in the gulf iran says the us navy presence was one of the 
military setbacks that forced it to accept the aug 20 ceasefire 
ending the war 
kuwaitiranian relations had been improving since the 
ceasefire but friction surfaced march 15 when kuwait said a 
number of fugitives its government wants on charges ranging from 
espionage to coup plotting were free in iran 
a spokesman for the iranian embassy in kuwait said we have no 
information yet we read the report like you in the newspaper

the government deployed thousands of 
riot troops throughout seoul sunday in a crackdown on radical 
groups to end antigovernment demonstrations students clashed with 
troops in two southern cities 
riot squads were posted outside important government buildings 
in seoul and at some major intersections 
police declined to say how many troops were deployed but about 
700 riot police in 18 buses were posted at the us embassy sunday 
roh last week ordered security forces to take tough measures to 
halt a wave of protests and break up radical organizations he said 
were trying to stage a violent revolution radicals have called for 
the resignation of roh who they say is not committed to genuine 
democracy 
no incidents were reported in seoul but radical students 
clashed with riot police in the southern provincial cities of 
chonju and kwangju according to yonhap the national news agency 
in chonju police battled about 600 protesters who hurled 
firebombs and rocks after they were blocked from marching out of 
chonbuk university yonhap said in kwangju several hundred 
students battled police after police stopped them from leaving 
chonam university to support strikers at a shipyard the report 
said 
about 1000 dissidents and radical students took part in a 
peaceful rally at korea university in western seoul to demand rohs 
immediate resignation dissident leaders denounced roh and accused 
him of attempting to impose military rule 
we call for the resignation of the roh taewoo regime which 
cannot carry out democratic reforms and does not represent the 
nation said a declaration by the united national democratic 
movement south koreas main dissident alliance 
about 2000 riot police in green combat fatigues and visored 
helmets were posted in sidestreets around the campus the 
protesters dispersed peacefully 
yonhap also reported that police arrested about 600 students 
late saturday after a violent protest earlier in the day at yonsei 
university in east seoul national police headquarters said it 
could not confirm the report 
roh announced march 20 he was indefinitely postponing a promised 
referendum on his performance because of disputes over how to hold 
the vote and violent protests by radicals 
the former general called the radicals a threat to political 
stability and said they were attempting to stage a leftist 
revolution 
radicals have mounted a series of violent antigovernment 
protests mainly on college campuses to call for rohs removal 
but they lack public support because most south koreans reject 
their violent tactics and are not seen as a serious threat to the 
governments hold on power 
it was not clear if roh could win a referendum even though his 
government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms many 
south koreans are critical of roh for his ties to his former ally 
and authoritarian predecessor former president chun doohwan

muchpublicized custody fight that prompted national interest in 
surrogate motherhood turns 3 years old on monday 
her natural mother mary beth whiteheadgould had agreed to be 
artificially inseminated and then give the child to the natural 
father but reneged on the deal after the baby was born 
the girl now known as melissa stern now lives with her father 
and his wife william and elizabeth stern of tenafly 
im not at liberty to discuss where melissa will celebrate 
her birthday mrs whiteheadgould said in a telephone interview 
sunday from her home in bayport ny 
when she agreed under a 10000 contract to bear the child she 
was a brick township housewife married to richard whitehead she 
rejected the money and sought custody of the child 
in 1987 a lower court judge stripped her of all parental 
rights in a case in which the baby was referred to baby m but the 
state supreme court restored parental and visitation rights to mrs 
whiteheadgould and outlawed surrogacy for pay in new jersey 
the starledger of newark reported that melissa would spend the 
weekend with mrs whiteheadgould and return to tenafly on monday 
a judge ruled in a visitation order last year that the child 
could spend birthdays with the sterns because she is being raised 
in their home and children normally have birthday parties with 
their friends 
mrs whiteheadgould has since divorced whitehead and remarried 
and has become a campaigner against surrogacy the sterns 
continually decline to be interviewed

transplant saturday could be out of the hospital in a few weeks 
hospital officials said sunday 
we think his recovery will be quite fast said dr jimmy a 
light washington hospital center transplantation services 
director if his recovery is uncomplicated we expect he will be

result if only his heart were replaced 
katz was admitted to the hospital friday hospital officials 
said he was within days of death and they decided to do both 
transplants on saturday 
the hospital center proceeded with the operation although it 
lacked official permission to perform pancreas transplants from the

emergency application with the city last week to do pancreas 
transplants but had yet received no official approval the

india and nepal on sunday failed to 
agree on new trade and transit treaties indian officials said 
raising fears the landlocked himalayan kingdom may face shortages 
of food and gasoline 
the trade treaty expired a year ago and india terminated its 
provisions thursday said the officials on condition of anonymity 
a separate transit agreement expired thursday even though 
nepalese authorities had asked india to continue its provisions 
until a new arrangement was signed officials said 
india closed 13 of the 15 customs check points along the 
countrys 1090 mile border with nepal after the treaties 
terminated foreign ministry spokesman aftab seth told reporters 
the officials also said the indian government imposed customs 
duties on all goods exported from india to nepal under the transit 
treaty india had allowed free access for overland transportation 
of goods imported and exported by nepal 
most of nepals foreign trade is either with india or conducted 
through india and border closings could lead to food and fuel 
shortages 
nepals foreign minister shailendra kumar upadhaya met his 
indian counterpart pv narasimha rao in new delhi on sunday 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the ministers 
failed to reach an agreement 
seth said the two sides agreed to discuss the issue at a later 
unspecified time 
officials said rao rejected a nepalese proposal that the trade 
and transit treaties should be negotiated jointly and not 
separately as india had suggested 
india and nepal have enjoyed friendly relations for decades 
there are no restrictions on travel between the neighbors 
but reports from katmandu said india was increasingly concerned 
over nepals expanding relations with china india fought a border 
war with china in 1962 and since then relations between the two 
nations have remained uneasy 
in august nepal reportedly bought unspecified chinese arms for 
its 30000strong armed forces

saying it is time to end the carnage and 
havoc caused by assault weapons the international association of 
chiefs of police announced its opposition sunday to the guns 
public sale and distribution 
its time we put an end to the carnage and havoc that occurs 
whenever an assault weapon gets into the hands of the wrong 
people said charles d reynolds chief of police in dover nh 
and president of the arlingtonbased police chiefs organization 
we need to find a way to keep these weapons out of the hands of 
criminals and misfits 
the resolution said it defined assault weapons as firearms with 
a high rate of fire and capacity for firepower such that its 
function as a legitimate recreational firearm is substantially 
outweighed by its possible use to kill and injure people those 
include the ar15 uzi m16 and ak47 the group said 
reynolds said his group is working with people favoring and 
opposing gun control trying to develop a reasonable position that 
will curb access to these firearms while leaving undisturbed the 
legitimate rights of sportsmen and hunters

pope john paul ii sunday offered easter 
wishes in 55 languages to a world he said was driven toward 
selfdestruction and the roman catholic patriarch in jerusalem 
blamed politicians for violence in the holy land 
the patriarch michel sabah made his comments before pilgrims 
at easter mass in jerusalems church of the holy sepulchre the 
site where christians believe jesus was resurrected 
elsewhere sunday shells and rockets pounded beirut as lebanese 
christians commemorated easter and in afghanistan about 30 
members of the dwindling western community gathered for services 
in czechoslovakia christians called for the pope to visit the 
communist nation and in some parts of the soviet union masses 
were held for the first time in years 
about 180000 faithful crowded the vaticans st peters square 
for john pauls message commemorating the resurrection of jesus 
christ 
in his 20minute speech in italian the pope decried religious 
persecution exploitation of women degeneration of family life 
sectarian strife and lack of concern for the environment 
earlier sunday the pope squinting in the warm spring sun held 
a mass on the steps of st peters basilica 
calling easter the new passover a reference to the old 
testament account of the miraculous rescue of the jews in egypt 
the pope said god passes where there do not exist conditions 
worthy of a truly human life through lack of housing promiscuity 
vagrancy where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage 
and the family breaks up 
he also decried violence against children and the shameful 
commerce of vicewhere women are still the main victim 
the pope devoted much of his message broadcast to 50 countries 
to places where consciences are oppressed where christs 
faithful cannot openly invoke him or suffer persecution because of 
their love of him 
in jerusalem sabah the first palestinian to serve as roman 
catholic patriarch or bishop of the city alluded to the 
searing conflict between israel and the palestinians in an easter 
mass 
under flickering candles and the glare of television lights the 
mass was intoned in latin french and arabic as pilgrims from 
throughout the world crowded the chapel that many believe contains 
christs tomb 
we find the reality of the holy land a reality of death and 
suffering sabah said in an easter plea for peace 
we find those who tell us each day we are hungry we are 
humiliated we are prisoners we have no schooling he said we 
find those who have died and those who have yet to die while the 
politicians take their time finding answers 
sabah named bishop in january 1987 never directly mentioned 
the palestinian uprising that for 15 months has torn the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
but his mention of the two peoples in this holy land and his 
repeated references to death clearly evoked the revolt in which 
more than 400 palestinians and 18 israelis have died 
in the soviet baltic republics of lithuania and latvia many 
christians celebrated the easter mass for the first time in years 
last year moscow handed back confiscated cathedrals to many 
communities after decades in government hands 
in czechoslovakia about 400 people gathered beneath the balcony 
of 89yearold roman catholic cardinal frantisek tomaseks baroque 
residence shouting long live our father and we want the 
holy father in a call for john paul to visit prague 
the demonstration of religious feeling came two weeks ahead of 
new negotiations between the communist authorities and the vatican 
to appoint new bishops czechoslovakia is the only soviet bloc 
country where communist authorities have for decades blocked the 
appointment of religious leaders 
in britain archbishop robert runcie spiritual leader of the 
church of england said we live in a world in which the worst 
looks as if it is going to happen and the worst often does happen 
and yet out of the anguish and waste love and trust come in new 
forms 
a sober look at the world seems to raise more fear than 
hope runcie told the congregation at canterbury cathedral

for the first time in more than 70 years soviets 
had a choice of candidates when they voted sunday for a new 
parliament in an election mikhail s gorbachev hailed as a triumph 
for his vision of democracy 
however maverick candidate boris n yeltsin running to 
represent moscow in the new 2250seat congress of peoples 
deputies claimed many soviets were worried about vote fraud and 
said the election wasnt completely democratic 
polling stations in moscow festooned with red banners and 
soviet flags opened at 7 am eleven time zones to the east in 
the kamchatka and chukotka regions of siberia polls closed as 
muscovites were still voting 
the millions of voters elected 1500 deputies to the congress 
which will choose the countrys president and elect about 400 of 
its members to a new fulltime legislature the supreme soviet 
the communist party labor unions and other officially 
sanctioned organizations have already directly elected 750 members 
of the congress which will meet once a year 
hundreds of races were contested for the first time in more than 
seven decades the election marked a revolutionary change in soviet 
politics where the party has allowed only one approved candidate 
to run for each seat since the days of vladimir i lenin 
the official tass news agency reported brisk to heavy voter 
turnout nationwide at one precinct in moscows krasnopresnenskaya 
district 84 percent of those eligible cast ballots according to a 
soviet television report 
final results may not be known for several days 
unofficial results given to western reporters at three moscow 
precincts showed yeltsin leading his opponent auto plant director 
yevgeny brakov by 4069 votes to 532 a margin of better than 
75to1 
yeltsin campaigned against privileges afforded high soviet 
officials and called for speeding the pace of reform to improve 
living standards for all 
gorbachev is already assured of a seat in the new congress and 
the elections are unlikely to produce any major upheaval in the 
present power structure which is dominated by the communist party 
the last elections in which most russians had a choice occurred 
weeks after the november 1917 revolution that swept lenin and the 
bolsheviks to power 
in june 1987 two or more candidates competed in 4 percent of 
the races for municipal offices in what amounted to a test for 
greater democratization 
but sunday marked the first such balloting on a nationwide 
scale in 74 percent of the districts there were two or more 
competing candidates the central election commission said 
however according to the weekly moscow news 82 percent of 
those running in sundays races are communist party members 
guaranteeing the countrys ruling political party will dominate 
whatever assembly emerges from the voting 
gorbachev who with his wife raisa voted at moscows institute 
of chemical physics told reporters the occasionally boisterous 
campaign caused by the multicandidate election was just what the 
kremlin leadership wanted 
the electoral law that we passed has justified our hopes 
gorbachev said as mrs gorbachev holding a blue umbrella stood 
beside him under a light rain it has advanced the political 
thought and social activity of the people and this is what we 
wanted to achieve 
the 58yearold gorbachev already elected to the congress by 
the communist party picked up a paper ballot walked to a wooden 
voting booth and closed the curtain after 25 seconds he emerged 
and dropped his ballot in a box he would not disclose for whom he 
voted 
the president said his policies of pressing for more democracy 
and openness in soviet society while not permitting any legal 
opposition to the communist party are the key to opening the 
potential of our socialist society with the purpose of taking into 
account the various interests of people and harmonizing them on the 
basis of consensus or a majority 
gorbachev said political pluralism is not a panacea for 
solving problems and expressing a plurality of opinions 
despite calls by some protesters for a multiparty system 
gorbachev said he was confident most soviets supported his views 
yeltsin attempting a political comeback following his november 
1987 ouster as moscows party boss voted at the young pioneers 
palace in the soviet capital 
he said the elections were not fully democratic but called 
them a big step forward he told reporters soviets in 
particular were worried about election results worried that 
there will be deviation at election stations during the vote 
counting everything is troubling them 
yeltsin who has become an antiestablishment figure in the city 
where he once headed the communist party machine has charged the 
citys party apparatus is out to sabotage his candidacy 
the moscowbased central election commission which counts the 
ballots said about 190 million of the soviet unions 285 million 
people are eligible to vote 
tass said the commission began its roundtheclock job of 
tabulating returns sunday night after receiving telegrams 
containing preliminary results from the soviet far east commission 
spokesman nikolai n isaeev told reporters certified returns for 
moscow would be made public monday night 
the counting of ballots nationwide is expected to take several 
days the election commission is required to make full returns 
public by april 5 
all soviets over 18 years old are permitted to vote unless they 
have been certified insane nearly 180000 neighborhood polling 
stations opened their doors to voters sunday morning and closed at 
8 pm local time 
elections in the soviet union were until sunday carefully 
choreographed rituals in which practically all eligible voters were 
said to turn out and those running got 999 percent of the vote 
some soviets expressed satisfaction at finally having a choice but 
there were also objections 
i think the quality of our leaders will improve because now we 
have a real democracy said dr valentina agababova as she sat on 
a windowsill at voting precinct no 5 in moscows sverdlovsk 
district crossing out names of candidates she opposed once upon 
a time wed just take the forms and throw them into the ballot 
box now for the first time were really voting 
but in southwestern moscows gagarin district where 12 
candidates were running some old people have gotten upset about 
having so many choices said local elections secretary natalya 
safonkina 
three soviet cosmonauts aboard the mir space station sergei 
krikalev valery polyakov and alexander volkov cast their ballots

a former soldier has finally gotten his 
recognition 44 years after he climbed into a bombers open bomb 
bay with no parachute and manually dropped a dozen 250pound bombs 
over nazi germany 
russell lee fisher performed his feat in 20belowzero 
temperatures and thin oxygen at 17000 feet while antiaircraft 
fire exploded around the plane according to records authorities 
say he almost certainly saved the lives of the eightman crew 
the retired civilian army employee and former state commander of 
the american legion received the distinguished flying cross in a 
ceremony saturday 
on march 30 1945 fisher was in a b17 bomber on a mission over 
the city of bremen when a malfunction made it impossible to release 
the planes bombs automatically 
the technical sergeant from thurmont climbed into the bomb bay 
hooked his leg around a small catwalk and began pulling pins that 
released the bombs to plummet into a railroad yard and munitions 
factory 
it happened too fast to be scared no one told me to do it no 
one asked me i just went down because i knew it had to be done 
fisher said before receiving the medal 
although his colleagues at the time recommended he receive a 
medal the war soon ended and in the confusion his honor was 
forgotten 
fisher didnt give it much thought until about five years ago 
when he ran into bernard e schlesinger jr the flights navigator 
he said im sorry the rest of the crew wasnt around when 
you got your medal fisher remembered 
i said what medal 
schlesinger an attorney from alexandria va started 
scratching around for information working with rep beverly 
b byron dmd to locate military records 
i wouldnt take a million dollars for my experiences said 
fisher but i wouldnt want to live through them again either

national security adviser brent scowcroft 
denied a report on sunday that us intelligence officials know who 
carried out the bombing of pan am flight 103 
appearing on cbs face the nation scowcroft said we are 
not that far along in the investigation of the dec 21 bombing of 
the jet which broke apart over lockerbie scotland killing 270 
people 
the sunday times of london reported that an extremist 
palestinian faction financed by iranian radicals is alleged to have 
carried out the bombing of pan am flight 103 and us intelligence 
knows where the bombers are 
the newspaper quoted unidentified sources in washington as 
saying the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command made and planted the bomb on behalf of iranians seeking 
revenge for the us navy downing of an iranian civilian jetliner 
over the persian gulf on july 3 all 290 people on board the 
iranian plane were killed 
the newspaper quoted one source as saying the palestinian group 
was paid 10 million to destroy the new yorkbound pan am jumbo jet 
the organization is led by ahmed jibril a palestine liberation 
organization renegade who opposes plo chief yasser arafats drive 
for peace negotiations with israel 
scowcroft said there was a marvelous bit of detective work 
going on in this whole thing but so far as i know yes we do 
not know specifically who did it 
as far as i know we are narrowing it down significantly but 
i dont know that there is a resolution scowcroft said

a man whose formal schooling stopped at eighth 
grade took on city hall in federal court without an attorney and 
won the largest award ever assessed the city for a political firing 
im still amazed said eugene wzorek 44 who expects a 
judgment totaling more than 200000 after battling for five years 
to get his truck driving job back i dont see how i got through 
it 
it wasnt easy apparently even for us district judge brian 
duff who for four days last summer goaded and helped wzorek 
through the legal maze of presenting witnesses introducing 
documents crossexaminations and a passionate closing argument 
he was winging it said attorney linda friedman who 
represented wzorek during the second phase of the trial to 
determine benefits 
its a fun transcript to read she said through the whole 
hearing he apologizes many times to the judge and tells the judge 
im trying like hell judge im trying like hell 
last tuesday duff ordered wzorek reinstated and set the damages 
at 132825 for back pay 13833 in interest 3750 in medical 
costs and pension credits of nearly 30000 
another attorney who worked with wzorek during the second phase 
of the trial john gubbins said the city probably will appeal so 
wzorek wont get his damage award anytime soon 
gubbins said the judgment is the largest of its kind ever handed 
down against the city 
wzorek also is being paid a salary and medical benefits 
reinstated by duff until next november although wzorek hasnt gone 
back to work 
during the first part of the trial which established that he 
had been improperly fired wzorek frequently called witnesses by 
their first names said ok and sure to the judge and told 
an opposing witness he thought the man was lying 
im nervous wzorek said to the judge at one point and i 
dont know what im doing 
wzorek argued that he was fired in 1984 by the harold washington 
administration because he gave 1000 to the unsuccessful mayoral 
campaign of richard m daley 
the city said he was fired because of poor performance and 
absenteeism even though wzorek had high performance ratings and 
good attendance 
the city is prohibited by a previous court ruling from firing 
employees for political reasons 
when wzorek first sued in 1984 he hired a lawyer but the 
lawsuit languished until last summer when duff decided there would 
be no more delays at that time wzorek had no lawyer 
i was scared to death he said but i was even more afraid 
that if we didnt go to trial after all that time the case would 
be thrown out 
this shows the system does work said wzorek that a 
little guy can take on the city and actually win if he gets a 
fair shake from a judge

the iranian navy seized an arab tycoons 
yacht carrying up to five members of kuwaits royal family and four 
britons diplomatic sources and news reports said sunday 
a british report said the iranian revolutionary guards were 
holding the yacht and demanding a ransom 
there were conflicting accounts about the identities of the 
hostages 
press reports in the persian gulf area said five members of 
kuwaits alsabah royal family and four young british women were 
taken captive when the yacht was seized thursday afternoon 
a diplomatic source in kuwait speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the 82foot yacht sailka had four british male crew 
members on board when it disappeared in the northern gulf on a trip 
from bahrain to kuwait 
the official gulf news agency in bahrain issued a brief dispatch 
late sunday saying responsible sources in bahrain and kuwait 
denied the reports circulated by new agencies about the loss of a 
yacht carrying gulf and foreign individuals aboard 
the sources in the two countries affirmed tonight that the 
official quarters had no information about the loss of any vessel 
or yacht or persons missing at sea 
a kuwaiti source said a report carried by a kuwaiti newspaper 
about the missing yacht is completely baseless the government 
has no information whatever about the reported hijacking of the 
yacht the source spoke with the condition of anonymity 
britains independent television news quoted diplomatic sources 
in kuwait as saying the yacht was seized for ransom after it 
strayed into a sensitive area near irans farsi island 
it did not identify the sources but reported they said kuwaiti 
government officials had leaked details of the abductions to the 
kuwaiti newspaper alanbaa because irans revolutionary guards were 
demanding a high ransom and negotiations between kuwait and iran 
were going badly alanbaa reported the story under banner 
headlines 
a spokesman for the iranian embassy in kuwait said we have no 
information yet we read the report like you in the newspaper 
a spokesman at the british foreign office in london was asked 
about the report and he said weve asked our embassies in the 
region but they know nothing about it 
alanbaa said it had the names of the people aboard the 
comandeered yacht but would not publish them to avoid affecting 
the secret contacts going on with iran at the highest levels to end 
the incident 
but the usually reliable newspaper said that among the captives 
was the son of a prominent arab who is not from the gulf region 
it said the blueandwhite yacht had departed from france and 
docked at bahrain a distress signal was picked up at 4 pm six 
hours after the vessel left bahrain thursday for kuwait according 
to the report 
george e covino maintenance manager of bahrains marina club 
said a distress signal was received thursday but the time he gave 
was about two hours later than that given by alanbaa 
covino reported that in the distress call a man speaking english 
with an arabic accent said my yacht is burning what can i do 
the yacht club manager said the caller did not respond to a request 
for his location 
gulf shipping executives noted that during the eightyear war 
between iran and iraq iranian boats frequently seized vessels if 
they strayed into iranian territorial waters 
farsi island was a base for gunboats used by irans 
revolutionary guards to attack oil tankers and other merchant ships 
during the war which was halted by a ceasefire last august 
kuwait was one of iraqs main financial backers during the war 
and iran claimed the ships its gunboats attacked were providing 
supplies to iraq 
kuwait registered 11 tankers in the united states and the us 
navy provided a war fleet in the gulf to protect shipping other 
foreign forces also sent warships into the gulf 
kuwaitiiranian relations had been improving since the 
ceasefire but friction surfaced march 15 when kuwait said a 
number of fugitives it was seeking for plotting a coup against the 
government were operating freely in iran 
three distant cousins of kuwaitis ruler sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah were among 112 passengers and crew aboard a kuwaiti 
airways jet hijacked by shiite moslem gunman last april on a flight 
from thailand to kuwait the hostages were released unharmed after 
the 16day ordeal ended in algeria

boris n yeltsin the fallen protege of president 
mikhail s gorbachev led his rival for parliament by a margin of 
more than 75to1 in early unofficial returns in sundays voting 
unofficial returns from three districts of the citywide moscow 
vote had yeltsin ahead with 4069 votes to 532 for yevgeny brakov 
director of the factory that makes zil limousines one of the 
flashiest symbols of soviet privilege which yeltsin targeted in 
his campaign 
certified returns for the voting in moscow would be made public 
monday night said nikolai n isaeev spokesman for the central 
election commission 
yeltsin suggested earlier in the day that the communist party 
might cheat him out of his political comeback by rigging the vote 
count 
of more than 2000 soviets interviewed at polling places after 
voting 1734 were for yeltsin and 162 for brakov others either 
refused to disclose how they voted or expressed opposition to 
either candidate 
the informal poll conducted by western correspondents was not 
a scientifically accurate indicator of the outcome but it 
supported yeltsins claim to widespread popular support which has 
surfaced increasingly toward the end of the first seriously 
contested political race in the soviet capital at least since the 
days of lenin 
yeltsins backers predicted he would win the support of 5 
million of moscows 67 million eligible voters yeltsin himself 
predicted victory but declined to specify a margin 
large proyeltsin rallies were held in the capital in the 
closing days of the campaign for the new 2250 congress of peoples 
deputies the first seriously contested open political race in 
moscow since the days of lenin 
people are worried about the election results worried that 
there will be deviations at election stations during vote 
counting yeltsin told reporters after voting sunday 
everything is troubling them 
democracy depends on the election procedure which hasnt been 
tested yet he said 
yeltsin 58 who headed moscows powerful communist party 
bureaucracy and held nonvoting membership on the ruling politburo 
before his ouster claims the party worked against his campaign 
he accused party officials of restricting public access to his 
campaign speeches and said they tried to damage his election 
chances by setting up a commission in the final weeks of the 
campaign to investigate his conduct 
yeltsin has demanded an end to special privileges for party and 
government officials such as access to special stores and 
chauffeured luxury cars he also has called for more radical 
economic reforms to fill empty store shelves 
brakov 51 has said his top priority is to end food shortages 
by providing more machinery to farmers and improving storage and 
processing facilities 
when yeltin was asked if he was satisfied with his campaign for 
moscows atlarge seat in the new congress he said sunday 
not in its entirety maybe its because there are things were 
not used to this leap to democracy had some positive and negative 
processes 
the election campaign he said was not fully democratic but 
was a big step forward from previous balloting in which only 
one candidate was put forward for each post but the real test of 
democracy will be whether the vote count is fair yeltsin said 
gorbachev who brought yeltsin into the leadership in 1985 and 
two years later oversaw his ouster on charges of making political 
mistakes and displaying personal ambition said criticism of party 
officials is normal during campaigns and that yeltsin was not the 
only one who received it

strikebound eastern airlines nearly idle while 
other carriers handled busy easter weekend traffic plans to return 
to federal court monday hoping to have its pilots ordered back to 
work 
the miamibased carrier also intends to open a school for its 
first group of 40 to 50 newly hired replacement pilots eastern 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak said 
ms ceremsak said eastern was forced to sit out what in years 
past has been one of its busiest most profitable weekends 
routes from the airlines miami hub to the northeast and from 
florida to the caribbean were the most heavily traveled on past 
easter weekends and of course theyre not running them now 
ms ceremsak said sunday 
under orders from the 11th us circuit court of appeals us 
district judge edward davis scheduled new hearings in miami to 
determine whether the 3weekold walkout by easterns 3600 pilots 
is a sympathy strike as the pilots claim or is a separate strike 
seeking its own aims as eastern management contends 
eastern asked a panel from the appeals court meeting last week 
in tallahassee to overturn davis earlier ruling that let the air 
line pilots association honor picket lines set up march 4 by 
easterns machinist union 
alpa claims the railway labor act gives its members the right to 
show sympathy for the striking machinists the appeals court 
agreed but added that a claim of a sympathy strike cannot be 
used as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear 
violation of the railway labor act 
eastern said if davis finds that alpa members stayed off the job 
not out of sympathy but primarily to pursue their own contract 
objectives without having exhausted all collective bargaining 
options under law the court would be expected to order them back 
to work 
the pilots however expressed cautious satisfaction with the 
appeals court move noting that the judges denied easterns request 
for an immediate injunction 
the appeals court ruling friday called on davis to report back 
to the court after his hearings on the issue 
the pilots union sunday also continued to downplay easterns 
efforts to hire replacement pilots saying there simply arent 
enough pilots to fill available airline slots especially at 
eastern and continential airlines the other carrier operated by 
frank lorenzo and his houstonbased texas air corp 
young pilots know better than to go to work for frank 
lorenzo said capt jack saux a delta airlines pilot and 
chairman of alpas education committee saux said in a news release 
that he and other alpa members have been meeting with pilots from 
regional airlines and corporations as well as student pilots across 
the nation 
if eastern thinks these pilots will replace the striking 
pilots at eastern they have another thing coming saux said 
we know these pilots and they know us they understand whats at 
stake here

permitting guards to carry loaded weapons on 
aircraft will not deter terrorists but could endanger the planes 
and passengers a trade union representing airline cabin crews said 
sunday 
the observer newspaper reported sunday that police officers 
escorting top politicians and members of the royal family are being 
allowed to carry loaded guns onto british aircraft under security 
regulations revised after the bombing of pan am flight 103 
security personnel have been permitted to carry only unloaded 
firearms onto aircraft 
the problem is that indiscriminate firing of guns which could 
always occur could create as much damage as anything else said 
george ryde national secretary of the transport and general 
workers unions civil aviation group 
the transport department said sunday it would not discuss 
security matters the civil aviation authority declined comment and 
scotland yard said it had no knowledge of the matter 
british airways which the observer identified as one of several 
airlines affected by the new order also said it could not comment 
ryde said armed guards on aircraft would do little to deter 
terrorists 
if the glass or shell of an aircraft is punctured it could 
cause decompression with people being sucked out he said 
what could an armed guard have done to prevent what happened 
at lockerbie he asked 
investigators have said a bomb caused flight 103 to explode in 
midair over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 killing all 259 people 
on board and another 11 on the ground the bomb was contained in a 
radiocassette player in the baggage hold they said 
the sunday times of london reported an extremist palestinian 
faction funded by iranian radicals was responsible for the bombing 
and that us intelligence officials know where the bombers are 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources in washington 
reported that the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command made and planted the bomb on behalf of 
iranians seeking revenge for the us navy downing of an iranian 
jetliner over the persian gulf last summer all 290 people on board 
the iranian plane were killed 
the newspaper quoted one source as saying the group was paid 10 
million dollars to destroy the new yorkbound jumbo jet 
the pflp is led by ahmed jibril a palestine liberation 
organization renegade who opposes plo chief yasser arafats current 
drive for peace negotiations with israel 
us national security adviser brent scowcroft sunday denied the 
report appearing on cbs face the nation scowcroft said we 
are not that far along in the investigation 
as far as i know we are narrowing it down significantly but 
i dont know that there is a resolution he said 
the observer said the new civil aviation authority regulation 
reads firearms may be loaded when retained by police officers in 
the passenger cabin of an aircraft 
the newspaper said the regulation was in a leaked copy of a 
restricted report on flight 103 by the governments national 
aviation security committee 
ryde a member of the committee said armed police were not 
discussed when the committee held a crisis meeting in january or 
at a regularly scheduled meeting in february he said he had not

the trend from early returns shows that we are no longer the 
first party acknowledged oltan sungurlu deputy chairman of the 
centerright motherland party 
sundays balloting did not directly affect the government of 
premier turgut ozal but opponents called it a referendum on ozals 
policies and ozal said before voting began that he might quit if 
voters favored opposition parties 
former premier suleyman demirel leader of the centerright true 
path party and erdal inonu who heads the leftist social democrat 
populist party both claimed victory over the motherland party 
inonu a nuclear physics professor turned politician declared 
the people accomplished a real spring cleaning making it clear 
who they wanted to see in power 
two people were killed and 35 were wounded in violence at voting 
booths in rural eastern turkey the anatolia news agency reported 
it said police detained 42 people in clashes between rival families 
over voting for village leaders

party losing mayoral races to the social democrats in turkeys 
three largest cities istanbul the nations financial and 
cultural center ankara the capital and izmir on the aegean coast 
returns from provincial assembly elections had the motherland 
party in third place behind true path and the social democrats

voters elected more than 326000 mayors provincial assembly 
members city council members village leaders and neighborhood 
representatives 
ozals mandate as premier runs until 1992 but his popularity 
has been slipping and his record was a major election issue 
during five years in power ozal has sought to rapidly modernize 
turkey building new roads public housing power plants and an 
improved telecommunications system trade has been liberalized and 
turkey has applied for membership in the european economic 
community 
but inflation that reached 75 percent last year cost ozal 
support 
public opinion polls before sundays election indicated ozals 
party would fall below the 36 percent of the vote it drew in the 
general elections in 1987 and the 416 percent in local polls five 
years ago 
opposition politicians have said early elections would be needed 
if the governing party drew less than a third of the vote 
ozal 61 ended his campaign friday telling voters he was 
prepared to quit if opposition gains were so large it would be 
difficult for him to govern 
the premier said that only he can prevent a return to the 
turbulence of the 1970s when terrorism and an economic crisis 
paved the way for a 1980 military takeover

the tanker that caused the nations 
biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate 
when the vessel ran aground on a reef exxon shipping co said 
sunday 
alaskas governor meanwhile declared oncepristine prince 
william sound a disaster area as the toll on the waterways 
abundant wildlife began to mount the coast guard said the slick 
and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of 
about 100 square miles 
exxon shipping spokesman brian dunphy told the associated press 
that the captain of the tanker exxon valdez joseph hazelwood was 
not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate 
gregory cousins was in command 
its exxons policy that in the waters that the ship was 
located in the captain should have been on the bridge dunphy 
said theres a problem there in that he was not there its our 
policy he should have been there 
an exxon spokeswoman sharon curranwescott said she believed 
cousins actions violated federal regulations 
he didnt have a proper pilots license for that he wasnt 
authorized by the company nor was it legal she said 
dunphy said he did not know why hazelwood was not on the bridge 
i am unaware of any explanation he has made at this time 
there is a full investigation that will occur on the incident 
dunphy said adding that the captain is consulting with an attorney 
as cleanup efforts continued sunday fishermen fearing lost 
income sought compensation sunday exxon shipping co held a 
meeting sunday between fishermen and a company claims officer 
were not ready to absorb any loss said riki ott 
spokeswoman for united fishermen of alaska we expect full 
compensation 
ten supertankers remained anchored 33 miles from valdez unable 
to move toward shore because the harbor remains closed the coast 
guard said it ordered the closure to prevent pollution from being 
carried to valdez on vessels passing through the oil 
department of interior spokeswoman pamela bergmann said a 
wildlife specialist sailed in the sound saturday and observed 75 
ducks and two otters coated with oil they could not be captured 
for cleaning she said 
gov steve cowper declared prince william sound a disaster area 
freeing state resources for cleanup and paving the way for a 
federal disaster declaration 
this oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit alaska 
since the good friday earthquake 25 years ago cowper said in a 
news release it requires the most thorough response we can 
muster and this disaster declaration is an important part of that 
response well be requesting president bush to make a similar 
declaration 
the 987foot tanker exxon valdez carrying 12 million barrels 
of north slope crude oil loaded at valdez ran onto a reef 25 miles 
from the port early friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to 
avoid ice valdez is at the southern end of the 800mile alaska oil 
pipeline 
estimates put the spill at 240000 barrels of oil or about 101 
million gallons making it the biggest us spill on record the 
only larger oilrelated accident in us waters was the spilling 
and burning of up to 107 million gallons of oil when two ships 
collided in galveston bay in 1979 
more than four miles of floating boom had been placed in an 
effort to contain the oil the coast guard said sunday an 
additional 3000 feet was to be deployed at galena bay at the 
request of fishermen skimming boats worked to remove the oil 
the coast guard estimated the area affected by the spill at 100 
square miles however exxon insisted that the area was only 10 to 
12 square miles and coast guard officials said they were at a loss 
to explain the difference in estimates 
the transfer of oil remaining aboard the exxon valdez to the 
exxon baton rouge resumed late saturday the coast guard said about 
84000 gallons of oil an hour was being transferred at that rate 
the unloading could take seven days 
by late sunday exxon officials said a total of 37500 barrels 
of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation 
leaving more than 900000 barrels on the ship 
tests were under way to determine if dispersal chemicals should 
be used despite the potential for environmental damage the agents 
need wave action to help break up the thick crude oil weather had 
been calm since the accident but the national weather service said 
the wind was expected to increase to 25 mph and stir up a 5 to 
6foot chop on the sound 
however the wind and waves may make it more difficult to skim 
oil off the water said coast guard lt ed wieliczkiewicz 
an experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil 
was completed early sunday and the coast guard said exxon officials 
were cautiously optimistic 
environmentalists the governor and other top state officials 
have accused exxon and alyeska pipeline service co of responding 
too slowly to the spill alyeska operates the terminal at valdez 
that loads tankers with north slope crude 
both companies said they were satisfied with the handling of the 
problem 
were proceeding cautiously said exxon spokesman tom 
cirigliano we want to make sure we dont make any mistakes in 
cleaning up the spill 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi said exxon has 
reviewed information gathered by divers and determined there are 
five holes in the vessels hull on the starboard side the largest 
is 20by6 feet 
all six tanks along the port side remain intact four are oil 
tanks two are ballast tanks 
investigation of the accident was turned over to the national 
transportation safety board on sunday the ships captain and two 
bridge crew members including cousins were relieved of duty 
saturday and subpoenaed by the ntsb 
iarossi said relieving the three was intended to allow them rest 
and was not a disciplinary measure hazelwood was in his cabin at 
the time of the accident iarossi said 
the third member of the bridge crew was identified as helmsman 
robert kagan 
the three were administered routine tests for drug and alcohol 
abuse but the results were not immediately available officials 
said 
the spill came at a time when prince william sound fishermen 
were preparing for the herring season which is followed by 
harvests of shellfish and salmon 
many are concerned they will get only minimal harvests because 
of the oil damage and then will face the longerterm problem of 
bad publicity 
this could ruin our reputation in asian markets for years to 
come said jim brown a netter 
the herring catch which usually takes place in april primarily 
is for the harvest of roe a delicacy that brings up to 25 per 
pound in japan 
its possible they could avoid the oil brown said fish 
are not stupid but they cant avoid the chemicals 
rick steiner of the university of alaska marine advisory program 
said the beaches on which the herring spawn could be polluted 
fishermen said they have had two good years back to back and 
some were spurred by that success to go into debt for new equipment 
this year 
ott said fishing is an economic mainstay in cordova more so 
than in valdez which also draws tourists and has the oil terminal 
half of cordova is operating on credit ott said

an unusually friendly standoff between 
environmentalists and loggers in a national forest resulted in 13 
arrests sunday including that of a man who buried himself 
neckdeep in a rock barricade 
the demonstrators at the willamette national forest were charged 
with disorderly conduct for blocking a road into the controversial 
north roaring devil timber sale site according to a marion county 
sheriffs dispatcher 
about 30 protesters had camped on a bridge over the breitenbush 
river and were there to greet bugaboo timber co workers when they 
arrived for a third day of logging in the disputed area 
the us forest service has sold timber rights in the north 
roaring devil site for 16 million logging began friday at the 
33acre area located on a remote ridge about 60 miles southeast of 
portland 
about 20 loggers gathered around the protesters bonfire when 
they were unable to proceed into the cutting area and the two 
sides spent several hours peacefully discussing their opposing 
views on oldgrowth logging 
the protesters argued that the timber site is forested with 
oldgrowth trees that are hundreds of years old and is a nesting 
ground for spotted owls which they say are endangered 
i feel real sympathetic towards the loggers said leslie 
hemstreet a protester from portland i know they have to make a 
living and they have to feed their kids but we need to come up 
with an alternative for them instead of cutting these trees down 
the timber cutters stressed that their livelihoods are at stake 
and argued that the stand of timber at issue is comprised of 
secondgrowth trees not the ancient oldgrowth trees 
people need to sit down and talk things out said bugaboo 
timber contractor dennis nielsen something needs to be done 
as far as im concerned these people are protesting the wrong 
people nielsen added they should be protesting the us 
forest service not us 
the timber sale already is the focus of a environmental lawsuit 
challenging forest service timber management practices in the 
willamette national forest 
sundays arrests were made after the loggers left and sheriffs 
deputies arrived accompanied by forest service workers the 
bannercarrying protesters obeyed an order to move off the bridge 
but proceeded further along the logging road refusing to clear the 
way 
authorities arrested the protesters at a 3foot rock wall that 
had been built across the road apparently overnight a member of 
the radical environmental group earth first was buried up to his 
neck in the barricade

takeover strategists take note your future 
competition may have more in common with r2d2 than with t boone 
pickens and carl icahn 
general electric co says it has taught a computer to keep track 
of mergers and acquisitions by reading the dow jones news service 
ticker 
the financeminded software package called scisor was created 
by the wifeandhusband team of lisa f rau and paul s jacobs at 
ges research and development center in schenectady ny 
the prototype software could be adapted to almost any area in 
which human beings under intense deadline pressure have to struggle 
through smothering amounts of paperwork ge said in an 
announcement for release monday 
users can ask the computer questions in simple english and get 
answers back the same way ge said giving this example 
user who received an offer from bethlehem steel 
system bethlehem steel took over rail mill 
the colorless language and relatively limited vocabulary of the 
dow jones wire made it ideal for experimentation ms rau said in 
an interview last week scisor did have some trouble at first with 
sweetened bids and tender offers she said 
its not reasoning with the information its simply taking 
the facts in a story and putting them down it doesnt know if 
something is true or false or reasonable or unreasonable she 
said 
the dow jones wire also called the ticker contains 
boileddown company announcements corporate earnings reports 
government actions affecting business and other information of 
interest to the investment community the wire a fixture in 
investment houses is part of dow jones amp co inc the publisher 
of the wall street journal 
ges own kidder peabody amp co brokerage unit is interested in 
scisor and will be given a demonstration in coming weeks but ge 
spokesman peter gwynne said it may be one or two years before any 
part of ge begins offering a scisorbased product 
the text enters the computer electronically and the user 
communicates with the machine through a keyboard it has a 
vocabulary of about 10000 words 
the system figures out a text by diagramming sentences in the 
manner of junior high school english classes it extracts 
additional sense by using programmedin expectations for example 
that the bigger company is usually the acquiring one 
ms rau said some financial people who have seen scisor in 
action are surprised how well it does 
in the distant future we can imagine the computer not as a 
static repository of information but as a librarian who not only 
knows where all the information in the library is kept but also 
has read and understood everything in the library ms rau said

voters in phoenix and its suburbs decide tuesday 
whether to add a halfpenny to their sales tax to finance an 84 
billion highway and transit program including a controversial 
103mile elevated railway 
the metropolitan area of 2 million people is the nations 
largest without an integrated freeway system a vast grid of 
northsouth eastwest streets is stamped across the desert 
relieved only by two interstate highways and a piece of state 
freeway 
maricopa county residents are saddled with some of the highest 
autoinsurance rates in the nation partly because of intersection 
collisions 
the population of this valley is going to double in the 
future whether we like it or not says herb drinkwater mayor of 
the wealthy suburb of scottsdale ive been here 43 years and i 
dont always like it but we have to deal with it and theres no 
way that there can be enough roads built to handle the traffic 
weve got to get out of our cars and get them off the road 
response to proposition 300 and its addition of a halfpenny to 
the 6cent sales tax is mixed neighborhood preservationists and 
taxdollar watchers have lined up against it while expansionists in 
the metropolitan area called the valley of the sun back it 
the ambitiousness of the valtrans proposition can be read in its 
statistics expansion of the bus system from 350 vehicles to 
1500 running longer expanded hours 23 miles of commuter rail 27 
miles of rapidtransit bus routes and the 103 miles of automated 
rapidtransit rail lines 
cost estimates range from 84 billion to 104 billion by the 
year 2019 but proponents call it about 44 annually for an average
