wilbert lee evans who said he deserved 
another chance for helping prison workers during a deathrow 
escape was executed wednesday night in virginias electric chair 
for the 1981 murder of a sheriffs deputy 
evans 44 was put to death 3 hours after the us supreme 
court denied a stay of execution gov l douglas wilder also 
refused a request for clemency as evans awaited his execution at 
the state penitentiary 
evans was led into the death chamber in the prisons basement 
strapped into the electric chair and administered two 55second 
surges of 2500 volts each said wayne farrar spokesman for the 
state department of corrections 
he was pronounced dead at 1109 pm 
bart stapert assistant director of the virginia coalition of 
jails and prisons said he met with evans and the inmate told him 
i want to say to the family of mr truesdale im dead you dont 
have to hate me any more 
evans was sentenced to die for shooting alexandria deputy 
sheriff william truesdale on jan 27 1981 truesdale was returning 
evans to the alexandria jail after a hearing when evans grabbed the 
deputys gun and shot him 
the supreme court issued its ruling at 730 pm justice 
thurgood marshall who opposes capital punishment in all cases was 
the lone dissenter in the 81 vote 
evans attorneys based final efforts to save him on his actions 
during the may 1984 breakout of six death row inmates at the 
mecklenburg correctional center the lawyers contended that evans 
who did not join the escapees intervened to save prison guards and 
nurses from harm 
in his dissent marshall said a system of capital punishment 
that would permit wilbert evans execution notwithstanding 
astonow unrefuted evidence showing that death is an improper 
sentence is a system that cannot stand 
it was the 141st execution in the united states since the 
supreme court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 and the 10th in 
virginia 
in a letter handdelivered to the governors office wednesday 
afternoon evans attorneys presented evidence from an internal 
state police and corrections department report on the escape 
only you governor can prevent the commonwealth from foisting 
upon wilbert evans tonight an unconstitutionally cruel and unusual 
punishment said the letter signed by attorney arthur f mathews 
the letter included excerpts of statements from prison guards 
and nurses that evans protected them during the escape one nurse 
said evans stopped inmates earl clanton and linwood briley from 
molesting her 
of the escapees clanton briley and his brother james briley 
have been executed the other three remain on death row 
evans said wednesday in a telephone interview from the 
penitentiary that he was keeping busy doing legal work writing 
his will and conferring by telephone with his attorneys 
youve got to keep your hope up he said 
evans described his feelings as a mixture of hope and caution 
clamminess and nervousness 
last saturday us district judge robert r merhige jr granted 
evans a stay merhige concluded the trial jurys finding of future 
dangerousness as a reason for imposing the death sentence was 
thrown into question by evans actions during the mecklenburg 
incident 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
overturned the stay tuesday the appeals panel accepted the states 
argument that evans was seeking clemency a matter for the 
governor not a question for the courts

the investment banker who helped rescue new york 
city from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970s said wednesday that 
the city faces a worse financial crisis now 
felix rohatyn 62 said he would step down as chairman of the 
municipal assistance corp by the end of the year to spend more 
time with his wife elizabeth who is recovering from recent 
surgery 
the assistance corporation was created in june 1975 to assist 
the city financially by using sales tax revenues to back bonds 
issued by the city new york was near bankruptcy at the time and 
rohatyn was one of the architects of its recovery 
rohatyn also a member of the citys council of economic 
advisers criticized union leaders demanding unrealistic pay 
hikes from the city 
rohatyn suggested that pension money now earmarked for a 
teachers pay raise instead go into city coffers 
rohatyn who has no direct say in the contract negotiations 
said the states fiscal problems and a much more serious city 
budget crisis prompted him to speak out at the oversight groups 
meeting wednesday 
the problems are financial economic and social and are of 
proportions that i havent seen in 40 years said rohatyn 
on oct 1 the city gave the united federation of teachers a 55 
percent pay increase in a oneyear contract the increase was 
predicated on rearranging the citys pension contribution to the 
teachers retirement fund and making a more optimistic forecast of 
the dividends earned 
rohatyn said that if the rearranged city contribution results in 
extra money it should go to help new york 
credible fiscal balance is necessary for full and free access 
to the credit markets social balance dictates the fewest number of 
layoffs possible he said in a letter to city council speaker 
peter vallone and the financial control board 
both objectives will be served by dedicating whatever pension 
savings are deemed prudent to the framework of an overall 
comprehensive city financial plan 
uft president sandra feldman said rohatyn is really meddling 
with things that are not really his affair 
mayor david dinkins said later wednesday that if the state 
legislature fails to pprove changes in pension earnings 
assumptions to finance half of the raise the city would not be 
liable for the difference 
rohatyn said similar demands from other unions are pushing the 
city closer and closer to a real crisis 
however barry feinstein president of teamsters local 237 
which represents 12000 city workers said pension assumptions were 
raised four times during mayor ed kochs administration the last 
time to balance the budget dinkins succeeded koch in january 
among the problems cited by rohatyn are a 18 billion budget 
gap already plugged for fiscal 1991 and a predicted shortfall of at 
least 2 billion through fiscal 1992 
standard amp poors corp last week placed the city on its credit 
watch list meaning the bond rating agency is reviewing the 
citys ability to pay interest and principal on 13 billion in 
general obligation bonds it did not change its bond rating for the 
city 
there are potential layoffs of city workers and city agencies 
are preparing to cut 1 billion over the next 21 months 
officials predict a statewide budget deficit of up to 3 billion 
in the fiscal year starting april 1 1991

floridas top banking regulator 
accepted campaign contributions from directors of 40 percent of the 
financial institutions that have failed in the state since 1985 a 
newspaper reported wednesday 
since 1985 39 financial institutions supervised by comptroller 
gerald lewis the only elected state banking regulator in the 
country have failed 
the directors of 16 contributed to lewis reelection campaigns 
beginning in 1982 the miami herald reported from 1982 through 
this year lewis received more than 25000 from those directors 
it said 
in at least five cases lewis received contributions from 
businessmen who later received permission to open statechartered 
institutions the newspaper said 
among his backers were the directors of two of the states 
largest sampls centrust in miami and first american bank and trust 
in north palm beach both of which failed this year 
republican chris comstock who is vying for lewis post said 
the democratic incumbent has compromised himself by taking of 
huge amounts of money from the people he regulates 
lewis the states chief financial officer since 1974 said he 
could not recall specific details of campaign contributions made 
eight years ago he said no contribution ever influenced his 
decisions 
his office could not prevent the bank failures lewis said 
if we closed down those institutions it shows we did act 
lewis said the fact is that we have taken aggressive actions 
against institutions that failed 
the sampl crisis is expected to cost taxpayers billions of dollars 
nationwide florida has one of the highest sampl failure rates in the 
country 
in september 1982 fort lauderdale businessman scott gettemy 
gave 3000 to lewis campaign the maximum allowed by state law 
in 1984 the intercapital savings bank was incorporated with 
gettemy as a director according to state records it failed two 
years later 
miami businessmen said haddad juan martinez raul sanchez ma 
schofman and cayetano midolo gave thousands of dollars for lewis 
1982 reelection less than two years later they opened the trust 
bank which failed in 1988 
the newspaper cited three other similar cases 
comstock a financial adviser in st petersburg who worked as a 
bank examiner for the new york state department of banking before 
moving to florida in 1982 said the donations created conflicts of 
interest 
it tends to prevent him from acting promptly when the 
situation warrants comstock said i dont think hes done a 
good job regulating banks

a judge who imposed a gag order on 
coverage of a murder trial then ordered reporters not to report 
the gag order has changed his mind 
the daily press of newport news ignoring a prohibition by 
circuit judge morris b gutterman reported both his gag order and 
the order against reporting that he imposed it the newspaper also 
appealed the order joined by the richmond timesdispatch the 
richmond news leader and the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar of 
norfolk 
gutterman lifted his orders after the newspapers attorneys met 
with him in his chambers tuesday 
the action seems beyond belief to me said rod smolla a law 
professor at the college of william and marys marshallwythe 
school of law and director of the institute of the bill of rights 
law 
it seems to me that it is unconstitutional for a judge to 
issue a gag order on the press in a criminal trial then to issue a 
second gag order to keep the first secret only compounds the 
problem he said 
smolla said hed never heard of a judge issued a gag order over 
his own gag order 
gutterman declined to comment on the case 
david c kohler an attorney representing richmond newspapers 
inc said gutterman was concerned about what the jury in the 
murder trial of herbert g fisher might see in the newspapers 
fisher is accused of killing his wife 
when the trial opened monday and the jury was out of the 
courtroom gutterman ordered reporters not to make public any 
courtroom activity that the jury did not see 
juries often are taken from the courtroom while attorneys argue 
points of law such as what evidence the jury should hear 
gutterman also ordered reporters not to publish any account of 
his order 
we thought it was clearly unconstitutional prior restraint 
said jack davis editor of the daily press and we didnt think 
we needed to abide by it 
kohler said the us supreme court has set out strict rules 
concerning gag orders in a 1973 ruling on a nebraska murder trial 
the high court set out three criteria before judges can restrict 
coverage of criminal trials a compelling reason for such an order 
no alternative and effectiveness

rep susan molinari would like to become 
soooo powerful that she could change womens fashion 
no more high heels or pantyhose ever 
when people make jokes about god being a woman i say i 
dont think so because then we wouldnt have the babies or 
stockings she said that was something a man did 
she rolls down the top of one black suede boot to prove shes a 
fashion rebel i wear boots all the time so i can wear knee 
socks 
molinari has a way to go before fashion avenue takes its cue 
from her but the new york republican is becoming betterknown 
around capitol hill where shes been since winning a special 
election in march 
last month just six months into her term molinari won her 
first big fight in congress defeating an amendment proposed by 
21term rep charles bennett dfla 
bennett a powerful member of the house armed services 
committee proposed closing the navy home port on staten island 
ny the heart of molinaris district the home port which is 
about 90 percent complete is opposed by new york mayor david 
dinkins and every member of the new york city congressional 
delegation except molinari and rep tom manton a queens democrat 
closing the home port would be cheaper than opening it bennett 
argued 
but molinari who at 32 is the youngest member of congress 
stood boldly on the house floor and hit her fellow congressmen 
where they live 
your base could be next she warned ominously 
the house voted 230 to 188 in favor of molinaris substitute 
amendment to save the base she was ecstatic 
that evening guy molinari offered a champagne toast to his 
daughters big feet an admission that they were finally large 
enough to fill his shoes 
susan molinari an only child succeeded her father to congress 
she is only the second daughter in history to do so winnifred 
mason huck rill followed her father william mason huck 
rill when he died in 1921 
after five terms in congress guy molinari retired last year to 
run successfully for staten island borough president 
to try for the house susan molinari gave up a seat on the new 
york city council that she had won in 1985 as the lone republican 
in the 35member body she was minority leader from day one and 
received such perks as a city car extra staff and an office in 
city hall 
but she said during a recent interview there was a certain 
level of frustration in being a member of the new york city 
council 
for example she could never become chairwoman of a committee 
and getting bills passed could be tough 
plus she said some of the most important problems that are 
confronting my district are environmental problems and those have 
to be handled on the federal level because of our proximity to new 
jersey 
staten island is downwind of new jerseys huge petrochemical 
industry and molinari believes thats why her constituents have 
such a high rate of respiratory ailments 
so while shes now one of 435 and still in the minority to boot 
molinari feels its a lot easier to get things done in congress 
than she had anticipated 
i expected the place to be more arcane in terms of 
participation in committees and ability to get legislation passed 
to speak on the floor she said in fact i find its a pretty 
open institution i find it less political than i ever expected it 
to be 
of course molinari came to washington with many advantages her 
fellow freshmen lack 
i have always received a lot of benefits both politically and 
personally having guy molinari as my father she admitted 
however having a record of 6 years in the city council people 
did have something to judge 
the fact that her father was new york state chairman of george 
bushs election committee in 1988 didnt hurt either bush 
appeared at a fundraiser for susan molinari in february partly to 
repay the debt to her father the event pulled in about 150000 
susan molinari said she hopes to continue some of the work her 
father started in congress and especially to see the home port 
open and running but she said she disagrees with her father on 
some key issues particularly those that define differences in 
gender and generation 
for one thing shes prochoice while hes antiabortion 
thats something that predates my political involvement 
she said admitting that the two of them dont even discuss the 
issue anymore 
she said she also places a higher priority on the issues of day 
care and parental leave 
molinari said shes fitting pretty well into the washington 
life renting an apartment in nearby alexandria va and going 
home on weekends to campaign having just won her congressional 
seat molinari is up for reelection in november along with all 
other house members 
but she said its hard being apart from her husband john 
lucchesi who runs a car service and the rest of her family on 
staten island 
theres a certain loneliness that comes with being removed 
from them but when you get to go home and not to sound like 
gooey but the night that you sleep in bed with your husband means 
more because you havent done it in five days

a brazilian cardinal has disclosed that two 
married men in his country became priests with the approval of the 
pope and says the church should seriously consider the ordination 
of more married men 
cardinal aloisio lorscheider said papal approval of the two 
ordinations came on condition the two men live with their wives as 
brother and sister meaning they must abstain from sex 
the disclosure by lorscheider which appeared in the italian 
magazine famiglia cristiana christian family in the third week of 
a monthlong gathering of bishops appeared to be an attempt to keep 
the question of married priests alive 
pope john paul ii has resolutely opposed waiving the celibacy 
rule for priests and conservative bishops kept the subject off the 
agenda of the bishops synod which among other issues is dealing 
with the diminishing number of candidates for the priesthood 
worldwide 
lorscheider one of more than 200 bishops attending the synod 
said allowing ordination of married men could help alleviate the 
shortage of priests in some areas 
there are christian communities not only in the third world 
which desire the eucharist and cant receive it he said we 
need to seriously study the issue 
roman catholic church rules require priests to be celibate and 
forsake marriage protestant and some easternrite catholic 
churches allow married priests 
the celibacy rule is based on the view that sex and marriage 
would distract the priest from giving his complete attention to the 
work of god 
lorscheider archbishop of fortaleza brazil did not identify 
the priests 
a vatican spokesman monsignor piero pennacchini identified one 
of them as ivo schmidt who had been serving as permanent deacon of 
the diocese of federico westphalen a city of 500000 people in 
southern brazil 
the spokesman said he was still checking on the second married 
priest italian newspapers reported he apparently lives in the 
state of pernambuco in northeastern brazil 
both ordinations are said to have occurred at least four years 
ago 
pennacchini and other vatican and church officials noted that 
exceptions to the celibacy rule have been made for priests from 
other denominations who convert to roman catholicism 
dozens of married episcopalians have done so in the united 
states for example they are allowed to continue living normal 
married lives

australia and new zealand are cursing 
the introduction of rabbits foxes opossums and other foreign 
animals which breed virtually unchecked because their natural 
predators were not brought along 
new zealand could be said to be facing a creeping ecological 
disaster with the impact of introduced species on our 
environment said philip woollaston its conservation minister 
we have a long and inglorious history of introducing new and 
alien elements into our environment homesick settlers brought 
familiar plants and animals to a country that looked foreign to 
them 
it has taken a long time for us to shake off the settler 
mentality of wanting to create a southern hemisphere european 
country 
some alien species were assets sheep cattle and various crops 
have become economic mainstays of both countries but the lists of 
foreign pests are long 
new zealands includes goats chamois opossums wasps and deer 
predators or parasites sometimes have been brought in as controls 
but they often created new problems 
foxes were once thought to be the answer to the rabbit 
menace woollaston said fortunately they did not take hold in 
new zealand as they have in australia where they have done 
terrible damage to indigenous fauna 
unfortunately stoats and weasels which also were introduced 
for rabbit control have found new zealand a very suitable 
habitat 
the opossum introduced from australia in the 19th century for 
its fur now is the main threat in new zealand the government has 
declared war on the animal which outnumbers the 31 million new 
zealanders about 23 to 1 
opossums devastate foilage in many forests and carry a form of 
tuberculosis that has infected other species particularly cattle 
there has been little resistance to poison pellets intended to 
kill opossums even though other animals also die 
agriculture minister jim sutton said new zealand needs a major 
research project to find biological methods of wiping out the 
opossum through disease or sterility without harming other species 
we have to do the research ourselves because this is a 
uniquely new zealand problem he said 
sutton said opossums could withstand a death rate of 5 million a 
year without a permanent reduction of their numbers 
margaret evans mayor of the north island city of hamilton has 
suggested an opossumhunting program to give jobs to the 
unemployed 
foxes and rabbits were brought to australia by europeans to be 
bred for hunting they now are blamed for contributing to the 
extinction of 18 marsupial species and threatening 30 
victoria state alone has about 25 million rabbits officials 
estimate they cost the national wool and cattle industries 100 
million a year which does not include environmental damage 
steve crabb the states environment minister suggests marketing 
fox pelts as an environmentally friendly alternative to other 
furs 
while the rabbit destroys vegetation the fox preys on birds 
reptiles and farm animals 
the fox did not coevolve with our native wildlife so these 
small animals have no defense mechanisms against it said clive 
marks of the keith turnbull research institute weve never had a 
predator like the fox its a very efficient killing machine 
australia has strict quarantine laws to keep out rabies and 
other animal diseases and officials fear the fox as a carrier 
should we get rabies our fox population would be the prime 
spreader of the disease marks said 
introduction of fleas carrying the rabbitspecific myxoma virus 
reduced the number of rabbits for a time until they developed 
immunities as with the opossum in new zealand the best hope for 
controlling australias rabbits and foxes lies in research 
efforts are under way to genetically alter existing viruses so 
they will make the animals sterile 
no one seems to know what to do about the queensland cane toad 
australias only toad and was introduced from south america in 
1935 to control the cane beetle and has been an ecological 
disaster 
cane toads grow to 8 inches in length eat virtually anything 
that moves and are prolific breeders when cornered they squirt a 
poison from neck glands that kills dogs cats even humans 
because of their bad experiences australia and new zealand look 
closely at any proposals to introduce new species 
new zealand recently rejected plans to raise catfish on fish 
farms and thousands that had been in quarantine were destroyed 
sport fishermen feared catfish would escape and destroy the trout 
another foreign creature that has flourished

the sandinistas bullied private 
businesmen for a decade while in power and are taking them on 
again this time as competitors 
they dont show up at chamber of commerce luncheons yet but 
many former sandinista leaders who once espoused marxism are now 
eyeing profit margins 
a lot of this is going on though exactly how much is not clear 
estimates of the number of sandinista companies range from 20 or 30 
to nearly 300 but there are no official records 
the source of the money is also in doubt president violeta 
chamorros government found the treasury nearly empty when it took 
over in april 
the companies are legal said a government official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity the question is where they got 
the means 
sandinista commercial interests now include stores newspapers 
radio stations farms real estate exportimport corporations and 
a television station some are owned outright by the sandinista 
front fsln and others by members with the front as a minority 
stockholder 
there is nothing wrong with a political party being in 
business within the framework of free enterprise said herti 
lewites the former sandinista tourism minister who is setting up 
some of the enterprises 
if i can make every member of the fsln rich i will he 
said 
lewites acknowledged that some marxist activists find the sudden 
entrepreneurial impulses of their fellows perplexing 
some of our militants and people in the government cannot 
quite assimilate this yet he said 
one of the most visible sandinista enterprises is central 
american airlines or caal which is to begin miamimanagua flights 
beginning oct 27 using a rented boeing 727 at the outset 
the airlines will charge 275 roundtrip the lowest fare between 
the two cities among carriers serving the region the ticket is to 
include free cocktails 
there is no reason why within a year we should not be flying 
to europe also said lewites the airline eventually plans 
flights to los angeles and san francisco mexico city madrid 
spain and london 
lewites has variously described the companys investors as saudi 
arabians greeks and lebanese 
in an interview last week he said the sandinista front had a 25 
percent interest in the airline and his personal stake was 3 
percent 
but at wednesdays news conference officially launching the 
airline lewites said there was no sandinista ownership 
i dont think even hertis grandmother believes that 
snickered a journalist from the cuban governments prensa latina 
news agency 
the sandinistas led the long struggle that overthrew the late 
president anastasio somzoa in july 1979 many of their leaders 
espoused marxist ideology and had trained in communist countries 
while in power the sandinistas frequently promised to support a 
mixed economy with plenty of room for private investors in 
practice the government seemed to make its economic policy as it 
went along nationalizations of companies and land often appeared 
arbitrary or aimed at political enemies 
the sandinistas economic policies and a ussponsored 
guerrilla war destroyed the economy 
when the sandinistas ran in free elections in february te 
voters rejected them for a more conservative coalition led by mrs 
chamorro 
most of the sandinista companies are headed by former government 
officials some of whom had left family businesses to join the 
sandinista revolution 
opponents claim some of the companies were stolen or set up with 
government funds and equipment sandinista officials have said the 
party squirreled away money supplied over the years by sympathetic 
foreign governments and other sources 
some businesses require little or no investment fernando 
guzman a former sandinista front official has the party as a 
minority partner in several companies including two importexport 
firms 
the fsln helped me get some of the contacts he said 
the sandinistas established trading companies in the united 
states panama and elsewhere years ago to circumvent the us 
embargo on trade with nicaragua 
manuel espinoza who was former president daniel ortegas press 
officer obtained a concession for a television station before the 
sandinistas left power 
as lewites put it the party must have resources things must 
change we cannot live off politics alone 
we are going to give the party a new image he added we 
are eliminating old taboos

its not exactly moses coming down from the 
mount with a set of tablets but president bush has an updated set 
of standards of ethical conduct for government officers and 
employees 
for instance 
thou shalt not hold financial interests that conflict with the 
conscientious performance of duty 
thou shalt not solicit or accept any gift or other item of 
monetary value from any person or entity seeking official action 
from doing business with or conducting activities regulated by 
the employees agency 
thou shalt not use public office for private gain 
these rules are contained in an order bush signed wednesday to 
establish fair and exacting standards of ethical conduct for all 
executive branch employees 
the order does not merely forbid it seeks what every 
rightthinking citizen wishes for his country such as 
employees shall put forth honest effort in the performance of 
their duties 
employees shall disclose waste fraud abuse and corruption 
to appropriate authorities 
the white house assures that these principles are not new for 
the bush administration that the presidents executive order is 
minor finetuning of ethical standards put in place on april 
12 1989 
on that day bush unveiled a fat package of proposals covering 
activities by executive branch employees as well as judges and 
congress it touched on campaign finance laws and acceptance of 
speech fees by congressmen 
the new order covers executive branch employees and officers 
whose boss is george bush these are the same employees who stand 
to be furloughed in wholesale numbers if there is no budget 
agreement by friday midnight 
the order said some fundamental principles of ethical service 
are in place to ensure that every citizen can have complete 
confidence in the integrity of the federal government 
it frowns on employees using federal property for other than 
authorized activities and forbids moonlighting jobs outside of 
government for most employees including seeking or negotiating 
for employment 
it says employees should obey the laws bearing on equal 
opportunity regardless of race color religion sex national 
origin age or handicap 
and it thinks employees like caesars wife must be above 
suspicion 
employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the 
appearance that they are violating the law 
the rest is more governmentese than bible who is responsible 
for administering the order the office of government ethics 
what will that office do it will do promulgating 
developing disseminating and periodically updating and of 
course ensuring 
one of the minor changes the document makes from the 1989 order 
is allowing lowerpaid fulltime noncareer government employees 
to engage in moonlighting 
all the while of course adhering to standards of conduct 
expected of a government employee

the city council has snuffed out a proposed 
smoking ban in restaurants deciding instead to consider having 
partitions and ventilation systems clear the air for nonsmoking 
diners 
the council deadlocked 66 on the outright ban tuesday before 
voting 84 to draft the compromise ordinance for restaurants 
serving more than 50 patrons 
los angeles already prohibits smoking in supermarkets elevators 
and at public meetings and requires nonsmoking areas in all large 
restaurants 
smaller cities including san luis obispo sacramento and aspen 
colo have passed restaurant smoking bans but los angeles with 
its nearly 4 million residents would have become the first major 
city to do so 
why shouldnt los angeles be a leader here asked councilman 
marvin braude who proposed the unsuccessful measure this ban is 
inevitable lets move forward and do it today 
restaurant lobbyists hailed defeat of the measure but attacked 
the compromise proposal that requires partitions and vents as a 
similar threat to the economic survival of many establishments 
its not a great compromise if were going to put restaurants 
out of business said rudy cole executive director of a 
coalition known as rsvp restaurants for a sensible voluntary 
policy on smoking the group claims to represent 1000 of thses to adopt 
quotas in hiring and promotion bush said 
tuesday he said that if the measure reached his desk he would 
be compelled to veto it 
the senate on tuesday night approved the measure 6234 short 
of the twothirds support that sponsors would need to override the 
threatened veto 
fiftythree democrats and nine republicans joined in supporting 
the measure while 34 republicans were opposed 
civil rights forces said they could count on the votes of three 
absent senators and thus needed only two more to reach the 67 
required for an override but the roll call revealed that despite 
many concessions they had gained no new support since july 18 when 
an earlier version cleared 6534 
the house was due to vote today on the bill which would 
effectively overturn six supreme court decisions handed down last 
year it has been the civil rights movements top priority on 
capitol hill in recent months 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages in extreme discrimination cases 
the major controversy though is over proposed changes in 
complex court rules governing job discrimination lawsuits the 
changes would make it easier for those filing suit to win and 
harder for employers to defend themselves 
the administration and business critics of the bill say 
employers would adopt quotas as a readymade defense in case they 
were taken to court sponsors of the bill scoff at this notion 
civil rights leaders who visited with bush in may in an effort 
to reach a compromise pla to ask for another chance to make the 
pitch for the bill and head off a veto 
this is going to be a defining issue for the bush 
administration and civil rights said ralph neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
he said a veto could resemble the bob jones university 
fiasco in which a storm erupted the reagan administrations move 
to grant taxexempt status to that institution despite charges that 
it practiced discrimination 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said i believe there is a 
good chance that president bush will sign this bill but if he 
vetoes it i think there is a good chance congress will override 
the veto 
sen arlen specter rpa who voted for the bill held out hope 
that even after months of disagreement the administration and 
sponsors could reach a compromise he said talks were getting under 
way again a summer of negotiations that were revived briefly in 
september have produced nothing 
some lawmakers believe bush will opt to pocket veto the 
bill allowing it to die for lack of a signature after congress 
adjourns and leaves washington for the campaign trail 
both sides in the debate have acknowledged that the sheer 
complexity of the measure has led to confusion 
it is not a battle between david duke and the rest of us 
for the soul of the republican party sen john c danforth 
rmo said it is a quibbling over words that lawyers have been 
involved in 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio was critical earlier of 
republicans for opposing the bill is this the republican party 
of abraham lincoln he said or is this the republican party of 
david duke 
gop lawmakers winced at the mention of duke a former ku klux 
klan leader and current louisiana state legislator who counts 
himself as a republican even though gop officials have taken 
enormous pains to repudiate him 
i think bringing in david duke is hitting below the belt a 
bit said sen orrin hatch rutah 
metzenbaum came back to the floor contritely later and said it 
had been inappropriate and improper to associate republicans 
with duke

failure at age 75 
bolet who died tuesday at his mountain view home retired from 
the concert stage last year because of declining health his last 
public performance was at a berlin recital june 8 1989 
there may be others who can play the notes but bolet with 
his roots in an older tradition than most today has a feeling 
for the line the elegance the suave sound the tapered phrase of 
high romanticism that is virtually unmatched today harold 
schonberg said of the pianist in a 1978 review for the new york 
times 
although not widely known early in his career bolet came to 
prominence during the past decade as the music of franz liszt 
enjoyed a resurgence of popularity

in the 1980s including nine of piano works by liszt he also 
recorded music by brahms grieg rachmaninoff schumann 
tchaikovsky and debussy

sen lloyd bentsen faces a difficult balancing 
act this week as he helps shepherd a deficitreduction plan through 
the senate 
as chairman of the finance committee he aims to promote a 
compromise that can pass a divided senate 
as a national democratic leader he knows that position could 
blunt his partys classconscious attack on president bush 
so the texas senator is doing his best to have it both ways 
doing the former and talking the latter 
bentsen and senate republicans have crafted a moderate 
deficitreduction plan a collection of new taxes and spending cuts 
devoid of the soaktherich elements house democrats put in their 
package 
when the country has these serious problems youve got to put 
the country first and not worry about the political consequences 
he said 
but bentsen also expressed longing for what the house democrats 
could do with their overwhelming majority and spiced his discussion 
with digs at bush 
i wanted to raise the tax rate on the top sixtenths of 1 
percent of the people he lamented but there was no way i 
could get the bill out of committee 
the american people were fed up with our not coming to an 
agreement and the president not bringing about the agreement 
not seeing that kind of leadership bentsen said in a television 
appearance sunday 
he kept up the criticism in an interview tuesday 
i think the president should be here involved and exercising 
leadership instead of making campaign trips for republican 
candidates he said 
what does not emerge is whether bentsen has his own campaign 
trips at the back of his mind will the democratic vice 
presidential nominee of 1988 seek the top job in 1992 
ive got loads to lift here he laughed 
those loads include a long list of unpopular tax increases and 
cuts in benefit programs raising americans costs for everything 
from beer to doctors visits 
this gets in the way of any national political ambition 
anybody may have said jack devore bentsens longtime spokesman 
in 1988 another former senate finance chairman sen bob dole 
rkan had his campaign for the gop presidential nomination 
derailed in part because he drafted a deficitreduction plan that 
included tax increases dole tried to make the deficit an issue 
refused to sign a nonewtaxes pledge and was defeated by bush 
but dole maintains that having served as chairman of the 
taxwriting committee actually was a big plus in his campaign 
compared with other candidates he had a broad knowledge of federal 
programs that voters wanted to talk about 
as for his loss dole said that was partly our fault we 
sat on a lead we thought we had 
the tax issue hurts most if you allow the opponents to 
characterize it agreed david moore a political scientist at the 
university of new hampshire bentsens early refusal to exempt home 
heating oil from a proposed petroleum tax obviously could be an 
issue that could be used against him and must be handled 
skillfully he said 
but while taxes are at the center of gop politics bentsens 
compromising could renew suspicions in his party that hes not the 
populist he sometimes portrays himself to be said republican 
campaign consultant eddie mahe 
after his vice presidential run bentsen rejoined private clubs 
he quit for the campaign and resumed his push for tax breaks for 
the oil industry 
he wants his cake and wants to eat it too mahe said

palestinian leaders today boycotted a planned 
meeting with british foreign secretary douglas hurd and denounced 
israels refusal to accept a un investigation of last weeks 
temple mount killings 
meanwhile prime minister yitzhak shamir has appealed to 
president bush to put the temple mount incident behind us but 
again rejected a united nations probe of the killings at the sacred 
site a spokesman said today 
the security council voted unanimously on friday to condemn the 
fatal police shootings of 19 palestinians on oct 8 on jerusalems 
temple mount the resolution ordered a threemember investigation 
team to be sent to jerusalem 
the police assault in jerusalems old city began after 
palestinians began hurling stones from the temple mount down on 
jewish worshipers at the western wall judaisms holiest site 
the appeal to bush to repair torn usisraeli ties came in a 
letter sent after shamirs cabinet turned down the un probe said 
shamir spokesman avi pazner 
israels refusal to meet a un investigating delegation has 
increased tension in usisrael relations but a senior official 
said israeli leaders were privately seeking a compromise 
one proposal being studied the official said was to submit to 
the united nations the results of israels own investigation the 
israeli report is expected to be ready by the end of the month 
the palestinian leaders boycott of their planned meeting with 
the british foreign secretary came after statements attributed to 
hurd in israeli news reports that britain opposed a palestinian 
state 
the british consulate in arab east jerusalem issued a statement 
saying hurds remarks had been misreported 
the 27 palestinians who were to have met with hurd instead 
signed a statement and had it delivered to him 
israels refusal to cooperate with the un secretary 
generals mission of investigation is symptomatic not only of its 
continued intransigence but also of its contempt for the will of 
the security council and for the internationally recognized rights 
of the palestinian people the palestinian statement said 
shamirs letter to bush was sent monday a day after the cabinet 
rejected the weekend security council resolution condemning the 
killings and ordering the un probe 
pazner declined to make the letter public but summarized 
portions in a telephone interview 
he said shamir rejected a un probe for the simple reason 
that this resolution contains only a onesided condemnation and 
doesnt mention the attack on jews above all it deals a blow to 
israeli sovereignty over jerusalem 
pazner said that in the letter shamir suggests to bush to put 
the temple mount incident behind us and continue dialogue between 
israel and washington 
the mount is sacred to both religions and palestinians 
maintained they began throwing stones after rumors spread that a 
jewish extremist group was marching to the site which is under the 
control of moslem clerics 
the old city is part of land that israel annexed after capturing 
it from jordan in the 1967 middle east war most western countries 
do not recognize israels annexation of predominantly arab east 
jerusalem and consider it to be occupied territory like the west 
bank and gaza strip 
news of shamirs letter follows urging by both bush and 
secretary of state james a baker iii that israel reverse its 
decision to boycott the un mission 
it is the only way israel will be able to make its case to the 
security council baker said in washington on tuesday 
pazner insisted shamirs letter to the president offered no 
compromise on the issue of a un probe 
but a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the government was contemplating offering to give the united 
nations a report on the shootings by a threeman israeli 
investigating commission 
the israeli investigators headed by former mossad spy chief zvi 
zamir were expected to finish taking testimony today and compile 
their report by the months end 
israeli human rights activists already have criticized the 
israeli invesgitation as inadequate saying it cannot be truly 
independent since it is not headed by a judge and has no power to 
subpoena witnesses

an indictment charging a woman with providing 
cocaine to her unborn child has been thrown out by a superior court 
judge who called the charge a violation of the womans right to 
privacy 
judge suzanne v delvecchio on tuesday dismissed a drug 
distribution indictment against 24yearold josephine pellegrini a 
mother of three for cocaine found in the system of her infant 
nathan 
prosecutors said they had pursued the case to discourage 
pregnant women from taking illegal drugs 
but delvecchio said in a 16page ruling that there is no 
familiar bond more intimate and more fundamental than that between 
the mother and the fetus she carries in her womb 
she added this court will not permit the destruction of this 
relationship by the prosecution 
pellegrini of brockton was indicted by a plymouth county grand 
jury in september 1989 on charges of distributing cocaine to a 
minor and cocaine possession a drug screening by doctors at 
brockton hospital found cocaine in the urine of her son born july 
2 1989 
after reviewing nathans medical records authorities determined 
pellegrini must have ingested cocaine shortly before nathans 
birth 
instead of prosecution delvecchio suggested education and 
making available medical care and drug treatment centers for 
pregnant women to deal with increased drug abuse 
by imposing criminal sanctions a woman may turn away from 
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered thereby 
undermining the states asserted interests she said in the 
ruling the states interests would be further undermined when 
women seek to terminate their pregnancies for fear of criminal 
sanctions 
nancy gertner a lawyer who argued as a friendofthecourt for 
dismissal said the decision is a first in massachusetts courts and 
could be used as a precedent nationwide 
geline williams the assistant prosecutor handling the case 
said her office has not decided whether to appeal or to continue 
pursuing cocaine possession charges against pellegrini

the radioactive hulk of a 
semisubmerged soviet ship in a lake near the finnish border poses 
a major environmental hazard a finnish radiation safety official 
said today 
we have every reason to be worried and urgently need more 
information about the hulk said olli vilkamo senior inspector 
at the finnish center for radiation and nuclear safety 
the germanbuilt ship sunk in lake ladoga 30 miles from the 
finnishsoviet border was reportedly used in soviet secret 
military experiments during the 1950s 
lake ladoga supplies drinking water for 5 million people in 
leningrad the secondlargest soviet city it is the largest 
freshwater lake in europe 
finnish officials first learned of the existence of the 
radioactive hulk from finnish television journalists who had 
obtained a sovietmade documentary on the subject vilkamo said 
finnish television broadcast the film tuesday 
the soviet report said the ship contained 2000 tons of 
radioactive water containing strontium 90 a deadly substance 
present in fallout from nuclear explosions 
if the reports are true then its a lot and definitely 
there is a great risk here strontium 90 is extremely dangerous 
great caution has to be exercised in moving the hulk or pumping out 
the radioactive water vilkamo said 
finnish officials will assist soviet authorities in every way 
possible vilkamo said but added that they have their own very 
good experts and we are confident they can deal with it 
a treaty between finland and the soviet union obliges the two 
countries to report accidents and radioactive leaks to one another 
but vilkamo said he was uncertain whether the presence of the ship 
came under the agreement

the city council has embraced an extensive 
aids policy asserting sufferers rights and promoting prevention 
with controversial methods including distribution of condoms and 
hypodermic sterilization kits 
it is a policy that establishes a national model councilman 
joel wachs said it is a reaffirmation of our citys unwavering 
commitment to stand by people with aids 
it is fair to say that aids is nothing less than a national 
crisis 
the city council voted 111 tuesday to adopt a policy that 
declares aids a natural disaster and a global emergency 
about 112000 people in los angeles county are infected with the 
aids virus and more than 60000 of those people live within the 
city limits the document said 
the policy calls for increased spending on acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome at all levels of government city departments 
have six months to plan implementation and determine costs the 
community development department was ordered to estimate the 
policys longterm fiscal implications 
the document outlines new problems such as training for city 
employees and distribution of aids prevention kits including 
condoms and hypodermic needlecleaning bleach kits to people being 
released from jail 
the county not the city runs the jail system and the county 
board of supervisors has twice gone on record against public 
distribution of condoms and bleach kits 
the blueprint reinforces the citys stand against 
discrimination the position that aids patients have a right not to 
disclose their condition and that casual contact doesnt spread 
aids it gives city employees the right to withhold information on 
whether they have the disease 
the policy also affirms that everyone with the disease has a 
right to dignity respect civil rights and a choice of care and 
treatment options 
the policy urges the federal government to reverse immigration 
policies that exclude people who test positive to the hiv virus 
that causes aids it also opposes mandatory hiv testing and mass 
quarantines of aids patients 
councilman robert farrell called it a document of love 
commitment and passion

islamic fundamentalists are seeking to 
ban alcohol and debauchery at some tourist hotels in the 
latest move to impose koranic law in areas where they took power in 
elections four months ago 
algerian dock workers meanwhile refused to unload the french 
car ferry napoleon because it had previously transported french 
soldiers and military equipment to the persian gulf region 
the dock workers delayed the ferrys unloading by two hours 
tuesday as a sign of solidarity with iraq a union official 
said 
the fundamentalists of the islamic salvation front swept june 12 
council elections algerias first free vote since indpendence 
from france in 1962 and are the leading party going into 
legislative voting next spring 
fundamentalists on the provincial council of bouira east of the 
capital said tuesday that potential loss of tourist revenue does 
not outweigh the need to enforce islamic law at the hotels 
the hotels that are the target of their antialcohol campaign 
are frequented mostly by foreign tourists on their way to the 
rugged region one of this north african countrys main tourist 
attractions

german planes over france during april may and june of 1918 his 
exploits are recounted in the 1984 book lets go where the action 
is the wartime experiences of douglas campbell by jack eder 
two american pilots maj william thaw and capt dmk 
peterson had each previously downed five planes but they trained 
in france with the lafayette escadrille not under american 
commanders

to begin his military career with the 94th squadron known as the 
hat in the ring squadron of the first pursuit group 
he learned to fly at the army flying school in france then flew

i thought i was still asleep and dreaming jerome i 
friedman one of two americans who won the nobel prize in physics 
said today after hearing the news that he had been honored by the 
swedish academy of sciences 
friedman and henry w kendall won the prize with a third 
researcher canadian richard e taylor for work in the late 1960s 
that showed protons and neutrons once thought to be fundamental 
particles were made up of smaller components called quarks 
american elias james corey of harvard university won the prize 
in chemistry for research that simplified the production of 
plastics and other artificial fibers paints and dyes pesticides 
and drugs corey 62 has synthesized about 100 important drugs and 
other natural products the academy said 
corey said he was walking into the harvard chemistry building 
today when a graduate student told him he had won 
this is a statistically improbable event there are so many 
scientists who are so deserving he said 
he said that for years people had said he was nominated but i 
have maintained solid skepticism 
my philosphy has been to try to be as logical as i can i try 
to teach my science corey said 
about 15 students celebrated outside coreys office with cans of 
beer they said they couldnt afford champagne 
its an overwhelming experience i never expected it 
friedman said from his hotel room in fort worth texas where he 
was attending a conference 
friedman 60 and kendall 63 are professors at the 
massachusetts institute of technology taylor 60 born in medicine 
hat alberta is a professor at stanford university friedman lives 
in brookline mass and kendall in sharon mass 
taylor contacted at his stanford calif home this morning 
said he was surprised to hear he had been awarded the prize for his 
work on the quarks now believed to be the basic building blocks of 
matter 
one thing thats remarkable is how little you say when the 
conversation starts with the secretary of the academy in sweden 
said taylor who had been asleep when he was notified about 4 am 
its a big deal he conceded on the other hand i know a 
great many people who have won the nobel prize its a great 
honor 
the nobelists who will share the 700000 physics prize 
conducted a series of experiments at stanford between 1968 and 1972 
involving the acceleration of protons in order to better examine 
their structures 
that process taylor said started an even longer process where 
more quarks were discovered 
this was one step in the chain to forge that essential 
understanding we have now of the elementary particles he said 
taylor said he was most influenced by wkh panofsky then 
director of the stanford linear acceleration center 
it was his vision and hard work that generated the accelerator 
to do the experiment taylor said i think of him as directly 
responsible 
panofsky is now director emeritus of the center which is 
operated by stanford for the department of energy 
it was one of the profound contributions made to the field 
panofsky said when contacted at his los altos calif home this 
morning and it came out differently from the way the thing was 
intended im very happy thats about all i can say 
panofsky said he wasnt surprised that the three won the nobel 
prize nearly 20 years after the conclusion of their experiments 
i knew it was clearly a classical achievement that changed the 
way one looked at the structure of things he said it was 
something that was clearly deserved for a long time and it was 
sooner or later one would hope that this would happen 
friedman said curiosity led them to it 
as human beings we have great curiosity about how nature 
works human beings try to understand everything he said 
one never knows what the application of basic research will 
be he added knowing what the structure of matter is 
ultimately has to have some effect on how you model the entire 
structure of things

the armybacked caretaker government 
today filed two more corruption cases against benazir bhutto 
intensifying the legal pressure on the ousted prime minister a week 
before national elections 
todays action brought to six the number of cases before special 
onejudge tribunals set up to try corruption charges against the 
37yearold former prime minister her husband and key members of 
her ousted government 
justice mohammad amir malik set a hearing for saturday to 
determine whether ms bhutto should stand trial 
some legal experts doubt that any of the cases against ms 
bhutto will be completed before parliamentary elections on oct 24 
they say pakistans judicial process is slow and cumbersome and 
that the courts seem reluctant to step up the process for fear that 
western countries especially the united states will cut off 
millions of dollars in economic and military aid if ms bhutto is 
disqualified 
but growing resentment over us influence in this moslem 
country of 110 million people has become an election issue and 
many fear ms bhutto will be disqualified just before the poll to 
spite washington 
president ghulam ishaq khan meanwhile sought to dispel fears 
expressed by some that the election will be canceled and martial 
law imposed 
the whole nation is looking forward to the holding of 
peaceful free fair and impartial elections and the smooth 
transfer of power to the popularly elected government ishaq khan 
said in a letter to top government leaders and gen mirza aslam 
beg the army chief of staff 
the letter was made public today by kamal azfar an aide to 
caretaker prime minister ghulam mustafa jatoi 
ms bhutto was dismissed aug 6 by ishaq khan who charged her 
20monthold government was so corrupt and so incompetent that it 
could no longer function she is challenging the decision in the 
courts 
the charges filed today allege ms bhutto used hundreds of 
millions of dollars in secret service funds to buy political favors 
and used government and military aircraft to transport supporters 
in parliament during a noconfidence vote last year 
she is being tried on similar charges before another special 
tribunal in lahore and one in karachi her hometown if convicted 
she could be banished from politics for seven years 
ms bhutto has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing 
at least seven former cabinet ministers including her 
fatherinlaw hakim ali zardari have been charged with corruption 
before tribunals and more than 100 supporters in her pakistan 
peoples party have been arrested 
her husband of nearly three years asif ali zardari also has 
been arrested and jailed in the abduction of a pakistaniborn 
british man in april 
zardari 38 and a candidate for parliament was charged with 
extortion and kidnapping before a special antiterrorism tribunal 
he has been denied bail and ordered held until tuesday the day 
before the election 
ms bhutto was allowed to visit her husband for two hours today 
their first visit since his arrest a week ago 
since her governments ouster ms bhuttos opponents have tried 
to portray her as a traitor sympathetic to neighboring india and to 
israel and a leader of a government that plundered the national 
treasury and left its financial institutions on the verge of 
bankruptcy 
but two separate opinion polls released earlier this week 
suggested the effort had backfired 
one poll indicated that a majority of pakistanis dont believe 
ms bhutto is corrupt although most are convinced her husband is 
another poll gives ms bhuttos opponents an edge in the 
election but indicates the outcome will be determined by a large 
number of undecided voters

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
oct 15 
statesman journal salem ore on the budget 
people with a heart will feel sorry for president bush 
his budget flipflops leave his party and his country wondering 
whos in charge and what to do next but who wouldnt flipflop 
when the budget decisions to be made are the toughest of the decade 
and when no one in his party much less in congress or the nation 
knows which way to go or can get anyone to follow 
if bush doesnt know exactly what should be done he has good 
company no one does and anyone who says he has the complete 
solution also may think that he is napoleon 
still someone with more influence than bush now must mount the 
podium pick up a baton and turn confusion and discord into harmony 
if the government is to survive after oct 19 and if the nation is 
to begin to climb out of its 3 trillion hole 
by default that responsibility goes to the democratic party as 
the majority party it must rule the country in the absence of the 
president if bush cant corral his republicans and force them to 
accept a compromise and he surely didnt earlier this month 
then the majority party must assume the leadership and take the 
first steps toward balancing the budge 
the democrats already have made the first moves by the time 
they are through we expect them to raise the tax on the rich and 
thus restore the equity that was lost during the reagan presidency 
when as even a former conservative insider said the rich got 
richer and the poor got poorer 
 
oct 14 
enterprisejournal mccomb miss on the budget 
president bushs popularity rating has declined polls show 
because of the budget troubles in congress voters seem to be 
blaming him rather than congress for proposed tax increases and 
spending cuts plus the embarrassing spectacle of a weekend 
shutdown in the federal establishment 
while we think theres plenty of blame to go around well 
defend bush on this one after all he is trying to find a way to 
stanch the flood of red ink he is pressuring congress to rope in 
the federal deficits which may sink us all hes trying to find a 
compromise by which congress can gradually diminish these huge cash 
shortfalls 
back home voters need to remember whether you are an 
individual a business a state or the us government you cant 
keep overspending your available funds thats what congress has 
been doing for years at an alarming rate 
if individual members of congress dont have the guts to curb 
the exploding debt then president bush must use the full force of 
his executive powers to correct their ways bush was wrong when he 
pledged no new taxes he is right now as he tries to forge a 
workable budget compromise that will satisfy budgetbusters of both 
parties he must keep it up until this budget problem in brought 
under control 
the trouble in congress is too many congressmen are scared of 
special interests the old people the farmers the poor people 
the wealthy arms industry 
for too long congress has refused to cut spending for too long 
president reagan then president bush pretended a tax increase was 
not needed for too long the voters havent really cared about or 
comprehended issues which concern hundreds of billions of dollars 
in the federal debt 
if we want goodies from the federal government we have to pay 
for them through taxes if we dont want to pay the taxes were 
going to have to give up some of the costly programs we have 
enjoyed our government cannot go on forever spending and 
borrowing 
 
oct 11 
phiaadelphia daily news on the budget 
we hold these truths to be selfevident 
truth no 1 ronald reagan pledged to lower taxes and 
congress went along the nations tax structure lost what little 
progressivity it once had and the nations debt exploded 
our tax structure must be more progressive the rich should have 
to pay more than they do 
truth no 2 even if tax rates for the rich were 100 percent 
the middle class will get hit hard thats where the money is 
without pain for the middle class the budgetbalancing act is 
phony 
truth no 3 you dont cut the medicare budget by raising 
the share of costs the elderly pay all you do is shift the burden 
from government to people 
truth no 4 slash all porkbarrel programs it doesnt matter 
whether its a dam or farm subsidies for corpocrats pretending to 
be farmers or defense 
truth no 5 dont touch welfare programs for the poor until 
you trim tax subsidies for the rest of us like homeowners and 
property tax deductions and the exclusion of employerpaid health 
insurance from income taxes 
like you we are fed up with excuses from our elected officials 
in washington about how tough it is to balance budgets 
if they cant get the job done its time to start electing 
people who will and thats another truth

albuquerque nm journal on the budget 
the hardfought budget compromise scuttled by the house of 
representatives has been replaced by a much more tenuous agreement 
with details to be worked out later smoke and mirrors gain new 
life in washingtons halfhearted skirmishing with the federal 
budget 
president bush declared interim victory and signed 
legislation necessary to reactivate the federal government 
following the columbus day hiatus but the president and 
congress stared the deficit monster straight in the eyes and 
blinked 
so we have yet another deadline to complete the details of the 
new agreement details that eluded congress for five months until 
its leaders reached the compromise with bush that was rejected by 
the rank and file the honorable senators and representatives have 
shown themselves adept at posturing but failures at governing 
responsibly 
 
oct 10 
bridgeton nj evening news on the national oil reserve 
we believe president bush made an error when he ordered five 
million gallons of oil taken from the national reserve 
american oil refiners are selling fuel abroad to take advantage 
of the higher prices available in europe than at home that 
however also drives prices up at home 
use of the oil reserves as a price control measure can be a 
temporary one only and for a very brief time 
opening the oil reserve now delays having to adopt oil 
conservation measures but it may make them more painful when they 
must be imposed 
carefully planned controls and institutions of conservation 
measures during the crisis seems to be the way to go

tucson ariz citizen on paying autoworkers who are laid off 
imagine how 6 billion could be used to build better domestic 
autos extend gas mileage improve safety and retool plants to 
compete better against imports 
instead us automakers will spend that much on a fund to keep 
paying autoworkers who get laid off 
under terms of a new contract with the united auto workers 
general motors has agreed to pay 4 billion and ford has agreed to 
pay 15 billion chrysler insists it cant afford anything but 
the uaw will probably get another halfbillion 
not even government workers are guaranteed a paycheck if there 
is no demand for the service or product they provide 
but the uaws tenure for autoworkers could be a big competitive 
disadvantage that could cut shrinking domestic auto sales and close 
plants so laidoff workers can be paid for doing nothing

fosters daily democrat dover nh on white house chief of 
staff john sununu 
when john sununu was tapped for what might be the second most 
powerful position in our nations government washington insiders 
were quick to establish a lottery as to how long he would last 
how long would it be before the brilliant but something less 
than modest sununu would fall under the knives and axes of those 
who inhabited those caves for years and decades before him 
no one expected the relationship between sununu and some of the 
veteran members of congress republicans as well as democrats 
to be a love feast 
the budgetdeficit reduction dispute was made to order for 
sununus talents he was able to go to capitol hill as the 
presidents pit bull take a few bites out of a few legs and return 
to the white house with a grin

the postcrescent appletonneenahmenasha wis on election 
year politics 
in search of a wise law we have come upon this forbid congress 
from enacting laws during election years or at least say during 
the last two or three months before the election 
chomping at the bit and galloping toward the stable the house 
of representatives approved anticrime legislation that 
would 
expand the death penalty by about 30 crimes leading rep 
dave obey dwis to despair in sarcasm would it be possible to 
bring the guillotines directly to the house floor 
deny a lawyer for an indigent deathrow inmate who petitions 
for a writ of habeas corpus this clause may not survive a 
constitutional challenge but any such reversal wouldnt take 
effect of course until well after the nov 6 elections 
to the houses credit it approved a codicil in the bill that 
would allow defendants to challenge their death sentences by 
alleging racial discrimination sad to say president bush has 
threatened to veto the entire measure in order to remove that 
racial justice act we wouldnt want to allow racial justice 
would we mr president 
none of this would be happening of course if this werent an 
election year and if all 435 members of the house werent up for 
reelection such goes the dispensation of justice in the united 
states and the lawmaking without which justice could not be 
dispensed

defense lawyers in the obscenity 
trial of the rap group 2 live crew dropped their motion today to 
have the audiotape of the groups concert excluded from the trial 
the move meant jurors will have to try to understand sexually 
explicit lyrics on the murky tape of the 45minute concert 
the bands attorney also asked for a mistrial this morning when 
one witness mentioned the concert for people of all ages that was 
held just before the adultsonly hollywood concert that got the 
band in trouble 
both sides had agreed before the trial not to refer to the 
bands toneddown concert that preceded the adultsonly version 
broward county judge june johnson said she would reserve judgment 
on that issue 
on tuesday johnson ruled that jurors cannot have transcripts of 
the raucous adultsonly concert last june that prompted the 
rappers arrest and set up a legal test of the limits of free 
speech 
she also closed the trial to observers under age 18 to the 
disappointment of some fans sheriffs deputies are under orders to 
check ids at the courtroom door 
i listen to 2 live crew in the car and at home but now they 
say i cant listen to it in the courtroom 13yearold lisette 
lopez said after she and four friends were told to leave 
in san antonio a judge rejected attempts to dismiss an 
obscenity charge against a record store owner who sold 2 live 
crews as nasty as they wanna be album 
county courtatlaw judge tony jimenez balked at defense claims 
tuesday that david risher owner of hogwild records and tapes was 
singled out for prosecution rishers trial is set for december 
2 live crew leader luther campbell and rappers mark brother 
marquis ross and chris kid ice wongwon are charged with 
obscenity for a june 10 concert at a hollywood fla nightclub 
they could get up to a year in prison and 1000 in fines 
the rappers arrests came four days after a federal judge 
pronounced the groups album as nasty as they wanna be obscene 
the album includes references to oral and anal sex and sexual 
violence against women 
the concert tape contains more than explicit violent sex 
prosecutor leslie robson said in opening arguments tuesday 
she said campbell and other band members can be heard profanely 
denouncing sheriff nick navarro who ordered their arrest and gov 
bob martinez who called for a crackdown on their music 
also campbell pressed the head of a woman toward his crotch 
and rapper ross exposed the breast of a young woman dancing on the 
stage the prosecutor said 
he knew there was something wrong robson said that there 
was a problem that there was a controversy that there was 
something wrong with that material that would open him up to some 
kind of liability 
defense attorney bruce rogow warned jurors that the lyrics might 
offend them but said that they must disregard their feelings in 
judging whether the words meet the legal definition of obscenity 
this is not about offending people this is about a legal 
test rogow said this is political speech protected speech 
later tuesday rogow asked that the tapes be excluded from the 
trial claiming prosecutors tampered with evidence when they had 
technicians try to reduce the static on the tape the judge said 
she would rule today 
earlier this month an allwhite jury convicted a black record 
store owner of obscenity for selling as nasty as they wanna be 
the band and some freespeech advocates contend the prosecution 
is rooted in whites misunderstanding of black culture or in 
animosity toward young blacks 
the sixmember jury at the rap groups trial includes one black 
a retired psychology professor who has questioned the validity of 
obscenity laws and a 24yearold office worker with a music degree 
obscenity cases are argued on a us supreme court test that 
holds material is obscene if the average person applying community 
standards finds it is designed to stir sexual arousal depicts sex 
in a patently offensive way and lacks literary artistic political 
or scientific value

central african republic to charge or release more than 30 
government opponents detained without trial 
the detainees included gen francois bozize a former government 
minister who leads the opposition peoples movement for the 
reconstruction of the central african republic they also included 
abel goumba leader of the opposition obangui patriotic frontlabor 
party amnesty international said 
the government has denied rumors that bozize died in custody 
bozize and 11 others have been held without trial for more tha 
a year after being forcibly repatriated from benin they were 
allegedly connected with a coup attempt in march 1982 the human 
rights group said in its report 
officials in benin arrested the men in the capital of cotonou on 
july 24 1989 and handed them over to central african republic 
authorities the following month said the report published 
thursday 
the repatriation appears to have taken place without any 
formal extradition procedures being followed it said 
amnesty international said the government initially said the men 
were wanted in connection with the coup attempt but later alleged 
they had planned to sabotage fuel and electric installations and 
carry out assassinations 
they are being held in military custody without access to 
lawyers or family and some have reportedly been beaten and 
illtreated the report said 
bozizes younger brother honorat ouilebona cocksiss also has 
been held since his arrest dec 29 1989 michel ngouni an air 
force pilot also related to bozize has been held since november 
1989 
goumba was arrested in september with 19 others including 
several former government ministers the group was detained after 
meeting apparently to plan a prodemocracy demonstration the 
report said 
the army chief gen andre kolingba took control of the central 
african republic in a bloodless coup on sept 1 1981 
under the constitution adopted by a 1986 referendum the only 
legal political party is kolingbas rassemblement democratique

abortion foes marked democratic gov cecil 
andrus for defeat last march after he vetoed what would have been 
the nations strictest state abortion law 
seven months later andrus is the oddson favorite to win an 
unprecedented fourth term and the wrath over his veto has all but 
evaporated the republican nominee roger fairchild has been 
unable to attract support for his antiestablishment campaign 
still the 59yearold andrus is running as hard as ever in what 
he says will be his last political campaign 
im going to be taking nothing for granted the governor 
said as he made his way through a 100city campaign tour 
andrus is driven by his slim 3600vote victory in 1986 he also 
wants a big win to help boost the prospects of democrats running 
for attorney general treasurer and the state legislature 
andrus said he opposes abortion but vetoed the legislation last 
march because it was too strict in cases of rape and incest and too 
liberal in cases of severe fetal deformity his explanation appears 
to have satisfied most voters 
fairchild a former state senate majority leader began the 
campaign declaring that he would have signed the antiabortion bill 
in a babys heartbeat but he virtually stopped attacking 
andrus on the issue after it didnt get much response 
there has been little evidence of activity by antiabortion 
activists a few small demonstrations at andrus appearances across 
the state have been little more than annoyances 
interest also has faded from an earlier controversy over a stint 
by andrus wife as a highpaid corporate director in addition the 
child sex abuse trial of kermit kiebert an andrus political ally 
and state transportation director ended in acquittal 
andrus has shrugged off charges from fairchild of deceit 
financial gain from public service and isolation from the people 
he focuses on the states economic resurgence and other successes 
since 1987 
i made some promises four years ago about schools and jobs and 
protection of children and the quality of life andrus said 
weve kept those promises i think the ship of state is on a 
pretty steady course 
since andrus took office more than 30000 more people have 
found jobs state aid to public schools is up 43 percent and the 
state has had three straight multimilliondollar budget surpluses 
andrus said fairchilds campaign for reforms that would bar 
corporate and outofstate political contributions was spurred by 
disillusionment anger and downright desperation 
fairchild 37 hasnt let up even though he is short on money 
and believes the republican party has abandoned him the party that 
gave its 1986 nominee 25000 has dropped just 500 into 
fairchilds treasury 
he has generated only pocket change compared to the 1 million 
campaign warchest andrus has amassed 
its kind of intimidating to go up against him fairchild 
said this guy was governor when i was in high school hell 
i voted for cecil andrus in 1974 
but fairchild insists andrus has changed since then 
cecil andrus was a different guy in 1974 fairchild said 
he hadnt ost his roots he was still a common man he was a 
grassroots democrat 
fairchild said people now see andrus as just a typical 
politician standing there taking credit for things going well in 
a year that the public has finally had its fill of politicians 
cecil andrus is the quintessential politician 
andrus resigned midway through his second term to become 
president carters interior secretary he returned to idaho in 1981 
to run a private consulting firm and was elected governor again in 
1986 
fairchild invested 90000 of his own money to win a threeway 
primary in which he overcame charges from his exwife that he used 
drugs and beat her and her children 
fairchild admits he was an indiscreet young man who would drag 
race drink beer smoke pot and shoot mailboxes but he says he 
has grown up and become a family man the former senator owns 
an apple processing company

housing starts skidded 06 percent in 
september continuing an eightmonth slide that has become the 
longest decline on record the government said wednesday analysts 
foresee no improvement before next year 
the expectation is we will slide down gradually into the 
first quarter which should be the low for the cycle said david 
f seiders chief economist with the national association of home 
builders 
the basic trend is declining levels of new construction 
through the first quarter agreed richard peach deputy chief 
economist with the mortgage bankers association 
the commerce department said starts of new homes and apartments 
fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 114 million units on 
top of a 1 percent drop in august 
it was the first time starts had fallen for eight straight 
months since the department began recording them in 1959 and the 
september level was the lowest since construction fell to 105 
million units in august 1982 during the last recession 
seiders said the home builders are forecasting starts to total 
just 104 million this year down from 138 million in 1989 and 
149 million in 1988 already starts are off 104 percent from the 
first nine months of 1989 
building permits often a barometer of future construction 
activity did not suggest improvement either they were down 42 
percent to an annual rate of 101 million applications on top of a 
30 percent drop the previous month 
the weakness in the housing industry has resulted in the loss of 
311000 construction jobs since last february seiders said 
construction unemployment totaled 118 percent in september alone 
when another 20000 jobs were lost he added 
singlefamily construction rose 42 percent to an annual rate of 
877000 units last month the first advance in six months but 
peach noted that singlefamily starts in the third quarter declined 
35 percent to 864000 units from the aprilmay period 
and multifamily starts plunged 143 percent to 258000 units at 
an annual rate they had gained 83 percent in august the first 
advance since last april 
part of the problem with apartment construction peach said is 
the pileup of starts earlier this year as builders attempted to 
beat a deadline for expensive new regulations designed to make 
apartments more accessible to the handicapped 
other problems for both single and multifamily construction 
peach added included high interest rates and limited sources of 
financing following the savings and loan crisis 
starts dropped 11 percent to an annual rate of 105000 units 
in the northeast and 44 percent to 328000 units in the west 
however starts rose 33 percent to 249000 units in the 
midwest and 3 percent to 453000 units in the south

here is a comparison of soviet economic plans one proposed by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and the other backed by 
russian president boris n yeltsin the soviet legislature is 
expected to pass the gorbachev plan perhaps as early as saturday 
and the russian legislature already has passed the more radical 
approach advocated by yeltsin 
 
pricesequals 
gorbachev plan onethird of all prices would be controlled by 
central authorities instead of nearly all as at present the 15 
soviet republics will have the right to raise prices for certain 
goods in accordance with local conditions and freeze prices if they 
rise out of control by 1992 only prices of staples such as bread 
meat and dairy products will still be fixed welfare payments would 
be indexed to price increases 
yeltsin plan the market rather than administrative decree 
would determine prices on many goods there would be gradual 
increases in wholesale prices of energy prices would be frozen on 
100 to 150 basic goods and services for the entire transition 
period after that the prices of 70 percent to 80 percent of goods 
would be free floating some rationing is not ruled out and some 
social assistance will be provided 
 
privatization of businesses and propertyequals 
gorbachev plan privatization of small businesses the plan 
drops reference to widescale ownership of private property 
gorbachev separately has called for a referendum on 
decollectivization of agricultural land 
yeltsin plan would end state control over businesses and 
property with the private sector prevailing in most industries and 
private citizens not agencies as property holders some property 
would be sold at low or symbolic cost to labor collectives leasing 
might be possible as would be private family property but the 
republics would determine some forms of ownership 
 
budget financingequals 
gorbachev plan federal budget would be financed through 
federal taxes republics and localities would also have the right 
to levy taxes a central bank would be created to control money 
supply and credit and the ruble would be the only legal tender 
throughout the country 
yeltsin plan strict control on state spending reform of the 
banking system russia would issue its own currency 
 
central controlequals 
gorbachev plan central government to retain control of 
defense energy production nuclear power highway and rail 
systems space exploration maritime affairs republics would 
control their own resources although details apparently would be 
left to a proposed interrepublic economic committee with as 
yet undefined enforcement powers 
yeltsin plan economic union would be on a voluntary basis 
central government would control most national security affairs 
although not all foreign relations republics largely would control 
their own energy resources

defense secretary dick cheney on a mission to moscow to discuss 
the persian gulf crisis met with president mikhail s gorbachev 
today amid soviet calls for a peaceful settlement to the dispute 
oil prices climbed after us and exiled kuwaiti officials ruled 
out a possible compromise solution to the crisis in which iraq 
would withdraw from most of kuwait but be permitted to keep some 
key land 
the official soviet news agency tass disclosed no details about 
cheneys meeting with gorbachev and soviet defense minister dimitri 
yazov 
also today western diplomatic sources reported three british 
men escaped overland from iraq to saudi arabia the three took a 
long route across the desert reaching the area of the saudi town 
of arar late monday said the sources in saudi arabia they spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
no immediate details were available on how the men evaded iraqi 
patrols and crossed the border their identities were not 
disclosed but they were said to be in their 20s or 30s 
three britons and two frenchmen escaped iraq by sea earlier this 
month but there have been no reported overland escapes since then 
thousands of westerners remain trapped in occupied kuwait and 
iraq either in hiding or detained by the government of iraqi 
president saddam hussein saddams troops invaded kuwait on aug 2 
hundreds of western hostages are being used as human shields at 
iraqi military and other strategic installations to deter attack by 
the usled multinational force deployed against iraq in the gulf 
and saudi arabia 
meanwhile soviet middle east expert yevgeny primakov was on a 
trip to europe and the united states to discuss the gulf crisis he 
arrived in paris today for talks with french president francois 
mitterrand 
the soviet leadership believes that if there is a smallest 
chance to settle the conflict peacefully that chance should be used 
to the ultimate gorbachev spokesman vitaly ignatenko said in 
moscow on tuesday 
at the united nations diplomats said britain was drafting a 
measure to make iraq pay war reparations and the united states was 
seeking to have the world body oversee the resupply of western 
diplomats who have refused to quit their countries embassies in 
kuwait city 
the only western holdouts are the british americans canadian 
and french 
britains foreign office said today that iraq had withdrawn 
diplomatic accreditation from eight british diplomatic personnel 
evacuated from kuwait to baghdad it said iraqs ambassador had 
been summoned to hear a protest against baghdads flagrant 
disregard for international law 
britain also told the iraqi ambassador that british nationals 
who have suffered damage or injury since iraqs invasion of kuwait 
intend to demand compensation a foreign office spokesman said 
oil prices continued to reflect fears over the crisis closing 
just short of 39 on tuesday up nearly 1 the rise was attributed 
in part to signs of a hardened us position toward saddam 
on the new york mercantile exchange a key market for oil and 
oil products the price of benchmark light sweet crude for november 
delivery closed at 3889 a barrel up 94 cents from the monday 
closing price prices fell back slightly this morning with 
november crude at 3875 in early trading today 
former persian gulf foes iran and iraq continued the process of 
reconciliation in the wake of their eightyear war the tehran 
times an englishlanguage iranian newspaper said today iran has 
appointed an ambassador to iraq 
although the two nations had not formally severed their ties 
during the 198088 conflict embassies were closed and diplomats 
withdrawn on sunday iran and iraq announced they had reopened 
embassies in each others capitals 
after primakovs recent trip to baghdad soviet media reported 
over the weekend that iraq might be prepared to pull out from most 
of kuwait in exchange for keeping the kuwaiti section of the 
rumailah oil field that straddles the iraqkuwait border as well as 
several strategic islands in the gulf 
primakov was to travel to washington for a meeting with bush on 
thursday 
kuwaitis fleeing into saudi arabia said the iraqis were setting 
up fences that separate most of kuwait from the rumailah field 
which saddam accused the kuwaitis of overexploiting before he 
invaded and annexed their country 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii rejected 
any concession to baghdad saying the united states will settle for 
nothing less than a complete iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
we are unwilling to engage in a search for partial 
solutions he said 
baker said saddam evidently was interested in a negotiated 
arrangement that would enable him to claim benefits from his 
unprovoked aggression against a small neighbor 
a unordered embargo on trade with iraq enforced by a 
multinational flotilla has caused shortages in iraq but has so far 
failed to force saddam to back down the pentagon says about 
430000 iraqi troops are in kuwait and have been building roads 
and fortifications

a hunter was found innocent today of 
manslaughter charges in the death of a woman he shot and killed 
when he mistook her for a deer two years ago 
a penobscot county superior court jury found donald rogerson 
innocent after about nine hours of deliberations 
rogerson a 47yearold supermarket produce manager was charged 
in the nov 15 1988 death of karen wood a 37yearold mother of 
twin 1yearold girls mrs wood was shot once in the chest while 
she stood about 130 feet behind her home in hermon a bangor 
suburb 
members of rogersons family jumped up and hugged each other 
after the jurys verdict was read 
mrs woods husband kevin hung his head and left the courtroom 
in silence 
im very overwhelmed at this time rogerson said as he 
walked out of the courthouse i hope and pray the lord will give 
mr wood the strength he has given me through this whole ordeal 
kevin wood who now lives in bettendorf iowa returned to maine 
to watch the trial he had predicted that rogerson would be 
acquitted 
wood has criticized the way maine authorities handled the case 
and said today he was stunned by the verdict 
im shocked that at least one of the 12 jury members couldnt 
after hearing all of the evidence come to the conclusion that 
donald rogerson was guilty wood said 
i think more than donald rogerson was on trial here i think 
the community standards of morality and integrity also were being 
tested i feel sorry for the community of bangor because i feel 
that they failed that test 
jurors refused to comment as they left the courthouse 
the case attracted national attention and had set off an 
emotional debate in maine over hunting safety 
mrs woods husband kevin who now lives in bettendorf iowa 
had predicted that rogerson would be cleared he attended the trial 
and has criticized the way maine authorities handled the case 
rogerson was first arrested and charged with manslaughter the 
evening of the shooting but a grand jury concluded in december 
1988 that his actions were neither criminally negligent nor 
criminally reckless 
but the state attorney generals office reopened the case in 
1989 after a portland television station reported that a nephew of 
rogersons defense lawyer had served on the grand jury 
rogerson was indicted by a second grand jury in december 1989 
the superior court jury weighed the evidence for seven hours 
tuesday before breaking for the night without reaching a verdict 
the panel deliberated about two hours this morning before clearing 
rogerson of the charge 
the father of three children rogerson would have faced up to 20 
years in prison if convicted 
in his testimony tuesday rogerson described the area where he 
was hunting as well traveled by deer 
i thought i heard the noise of an animal rogerson said i 
heard a snap i looked up and there was a buck deer in front of me 
then i saw the brown of the deer in my scope 
he said he fired one shot then saw two white flags the 
white underside of a deers tail and fired another shot he said 
he ran toward the object expecting to find a deer 
almost simultaneously i saw the house i saw the mittens and 
i saw her rogerson said 
mrs wood was wearing white mittens when she was shot 
the prosecution had rested its case monday after presenting 
three days of testimony 
the state presented 12 witnesses and introduced 26 pieces of 
evidence including spent shell casings the sweatshirt and mittens 
mrs wood was wearing when she was killed and rogersons hunting 
rifle 
prosecutors had argued that rogerson acted negligently or 
recklessly when he killed mrs wood rogerson was about 180 feet 
from mrs wood when he fired 
in closing arguments tuesday rogersons laywer lewis vafiades 
said no one could prove that rogerson didnt see a deer before 
firing his rifle 
the district game warden and other investigators testified that 
they couldnt find any deer tracks in the area where rogerson 
fired but vafiades said theyre just as human as you or i and 
they make mistakes 
prosecutor jeff hjelm said rogerson should have known better 
when he fired because he was unsure he was shooting at a deer 
anything less than absolute certainty about the target grossly 
violates the rules hjelm said guns are designed to kill so 
the dangers and risks of hunting could not be higher the stakes 
are literally life and death

police have some incentive to find a 
man who stole two red pickup trucks in one day both trucks 
belonged to police department employees 
i guess the guy had it in for police and red pickups sgt 
terry branum said of the monday thefts 
the thief remained at large wednesday police said 
the first theft was thwarted by reserve officer mike lovchik 
who walked out of a cerritos medical center to see his red 1984 
toyota pickup being backed out of a parking space 
lovchik jumped into the truck bed as the thief pulled away and 
started pounding on the window and yelling a few choice words at 
the guy branum said 
the thief drove onto the eastbound riverside freeway driving 
like a maniac at speeds of up to 90 mph branum said 
at one point they passed an la county sheriffs car and 
lovchik tries to flag them down but they dont see him branum 
said 
when the thief exited the freeway lovchik negotiated his 
trucks release 
he showed the suspect his badge and told him all he wanted was 
his truck and he would let him get away branum said of 
course thats not what he had in mind 
the thief however had other ideas he bailed out of the truck 
in a buena park cul de sac punching the accelerator pedal as he 
jumped branum said 
lovchik waited for his truck to slow down to try to stop it but 
he was unable to prevent it from crashing into a street light it 
received moderate damage 
the thief was last seen running through an apartment complex to 
a high school where he stole another red 1984 toyota pickup this 
one owned by a cypress police department records clerk

industrial production rose 02 percent in 
september the government reported wednesday with a 75 percent 
spurt in automobile production masking an underlying manufacturing 
weakness 
the federal reserve report was loaded by the motor vehicle 
numbers which are unsustainable contended robert g dederick 
chief economist for the northern trust co in chicago 
excluding autos the fed said production dropped 01 percent 
at the same time the central bank revised output figures for 
july and august to show the industrial economy stronger than first 
reported last summer production in july was boosted from flat to a 
02 percent gain while august output was changed from a 02 percent 
decline to a 01 percent advance 
there were a lot of questions about whether we were still 
growing in the third quarter said david jones an economist with 
aubrey g lanston amp co a new york securities dealer what we 
had was an economy that was slipping into recession in slow 
motion 
we still feel that given the sharp deterioration in consumer 
and business confidence on the heels of the oil shock the economy 
will show negative growth n the fourth quarter he added 
the 75 percent gain in auto output jones said resulted from 
aggressive rebates that tend to steal from future demand he 
noted that sales dropped from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
82 million in the last 10 days of september when incentives were 
offered to 65 million in the first 10 days of october 
production at manufacturing plants making both durable and 
nondurable goods rose 02 percent in september but the fed said 
apart from the sharp rise in motor vehicle assemblies 
manufacturing output dropped 02 percent 
indeed if you look at the components the declines were 
fairly widespread dederick said 
output of durable goods automobiles and other bigticket items 
expected to last at least three years increased 02 percent down 
slightly from a 03 percent gain in august 
manufacturing of nondurable goods also gained 02 percent after 
slipping 01 percent the previous month 
output at mines bounced back 04 percent after slumping 17 
percent in august utility production rose 09 percent after a 13 
percent advance the previous month due in part analysts said to 
warm weather 
the fed said its industrial production index in september stood 
at 1107 percent of its 1987 base up from 1104 percent in august 
the fed also said the operating rate of the nations factories 
mines and utilities was unchanged at 836 percent the operating 
rate measures not only output but also changes in productivity 
levels 
the operating rate at factories producing both durable and 
nondurable goods was unchanged the durable operating rate stood 
at 821 percent while the rate at plants making nondurable goods 
remained at 837 percent 
the operating rate at mines gained 04 percentage point to 89 
percent in september while it jumped 07 percentage point to 881 
percent at utilities

political candidates used to accuse their 
rivals of misstating the facts now theyre bluntly calling each 
other liars and thats hardly the worst insult that attentive 
voters have heard this season 
guilt by association is making a comeback with the villains 
ranging from hitler and saddam hussein to michael dukakis and 
charles keating 
the air and airwaves reverberate with epithets such as slimy 
and boozer campaign literature compares a new mexico 
gubernatorial candidate to a stale lounge act and a consultant 
calls a senator a weenie 
some of the gentility of the past is eroding says kathleen 
hall jamieson dean of the annenberg school of communication at the 
university of pennsylvania the claims have been phrased more 
diplomatically in the last four election cycles now youre getting 
blunter language 
the biggest departure this year from jamiesons perspective is 
that candidates are using a new lword liar in the past 
standins or surrogates used the word but the candidates themselves 
tried to project a loftier image 
clayton williams the republican governor candidate in texas 
scrapped the indirect approach last week and called democrat ann 
richards a liar to her face he was upset about her attempts to 
link him to a federal investigation into alleged drug money 
laundering 
im here to call you a liar today williams told richards 
that was after he refused to shake her hand 
a few days later jon grunseth the gop governor candidate in 
minnesota labeled democratic incumbent rudy perpich the supreme 
liar that was after perpich denied having anything to do with 
allegations that grunseth encouraged four teenage girls to swim 
nude with him at a party nine years ago 
intense character scrutiny has marked this years contests some 
of it sounding like a gradeschool grudge match and some of it 
slightly elevated to college level mybe 
former sen john tower sparked a round of insults last week 
while campaigning for former rep hal daub of nebraska who is 
running for the senate tower said daubs rival democratic sen 
james exon had the reputation in washington of being one of the 
two or three biggest boozers in the senate 
no one responded more colorfully than democratic sen bob 
kerrey exons homestate colleague towers behavior was 
larval kerrey said in a statement that also referred to towers 
wormlike lies 
many times this year surrogates have stomped into territory 
where candidates dared not tread 
for example michigan republican richard headlee said democratic 
gov james blanchards tactics have been as effective as the 
third reich under hitler john engler the gop candidate headlee 
was trying to help did not agree 
we dont share dicks view on that englers press secretary 
hastily explained dick gets somewhat carried away 
and republican rep lynn martin who is trying to unseat sen 
paul simon in illinois ended up apologizing to simon after an 
acidic news conference held by her media consultant roger ailes 
simon is just being simon which is unfortunately being 
slimy ailes said 
if that wasnt enough he also labeled simon a weenie 
on another occasion ailes had a few things to say about 
california treasurer candidate kathleen brown the sister of former 
gov jerry brown 
ailes dubbed her sister moonbeam and when she complained he 
responded she does not sound like a woman with all her oars in 
the water i think shes going to need some prozac before its 
all over 
bob squier ailes democratic counterpart has employed another 
strategy he has been a leader in what jamieson calls the 
distortive use of newspaper clips in tv ads 
the newspapers are becoming a weapon and not necessarily a 
legitimate one she said squier for example was forced to 
admit wrongdoing in an ad he made for richards in texas 
the ad showed a partial headline that said lawsuits allege 
williams a deadbeat squier left off the last two words of the 
headline that made clear where the accusations came from 
richards discloses 
richards has since started using two positive tv spots also 
made by squier but consultants in at least two other major races 
found themselves on the sidelines when their candidates decided to 
switch into feelgood mode 
democratic senate contender josie heath of colorado started an 
upbeat ad campaign two weeks after trading in one agency for 
another and republican dave frohnmayer running for governor of 
oregon fired his admakers because he said his image had become 
too strident 
still niceness is waning fast in most races even the genteel 
senate contest between sen claiborne pell and gop rep claudine 
schneider has succumbed to the dominant tone of the season after 
weeks of skirting the age issue schneider 43 recently referred 
to pell 71 as out of it 
her comment was mild compared to the barbstrewn battlegrounds 
in texas illinois massachusetts and elsewhere gop rep bill 
schuette may have been speaking for more voters and candidates than 
he knew during a recent debatet in september alone 
when another 20000 jobs were lost he added 
singlefamily construction rose 42 percent to an annual rate of 
877000 units last month the first advance in six months but 
peach noted that singlefamily starts in the third quarter declined 
35 percent to 864000 units from the aprilmay period 
and multifamily starts plunged 143 percent to 258000 units at 
an annual rate they had gained 83 percent in august the first 
advance since last april 
part of the problem with apartment construction peach said is 
the pileup of starts earlier this year as builders attempted to 
beat a deadline for expensive new regulations designed to make 
apartments more accessible to the handicapped 
other problems for both single and multifamily construction 
peach added included high interest rates and limited sources of 
financing following the savings and loan crisis 
starts dropped 11 percent to an annual rate of 105000 units 
in the northeast and 44 percent to 328000 units in the west 
however starts rose 33 percent to 249000 units in the 
midwest and 3 percent to 453000 units in the south

the house today gave final approval 273154 
to a major civil rights bill designed to combat job bias setting 
the stage for a veto confrontation with president bush 
bush has said hell veto the legislation because it will force 
businesses to set hiring quotas 
provisions in the bill range from a ban on racial harassment in 
the workplace to punitive damages in the most severe discrimination 
cases 
the house passed the bill by a comfortable margin but that 
falls just short of the twothirds needed to override presidential 
veto and pass the bill into law over presidential objections 
the senate approved the measure tuesday night 6234 also short 
of the needed votes to override the expected veto 
the bill represents the civil rights movements top goal on 
capitol hill and would overturn six supreme court decisions on job 
discrimination handed down last year that set off protests

two americans and a canadian captured 
the nobel prize in physics wednesday for finding natures smallest 
known particle an american won the nobel in chemistry for 
developing simpler ways to make complex chemicals 
americans jerome i friedman and henry w kendall and canadian 
richard e taylor showed that protons and neutrons once thought to 
be fundamental particles were made up of smaller components called 
quarks quarks are now believed to be basic building blocks of 
matter 
american elias james corey won the prize in chemistry for 
research that simplified the production of plastics and other 
artificial fibers paints and dyes pesticides and drugs 
this is a statistically improbable event corey said of 
winning the award there are so many scientists who are so 
deserving 
he found out he had won when a student congratulated him in the 
hallway 
the swedish academy of sciences which awards both prizes said 
coreys work has contributed to the high standards of living and 
health and the longevity enjoyed in the western world 
each prize is worth about 700000 
here was a repetition although at a deeper level of one of 
the most dramatic events in the history of physics the discovery 
of the nucleus of the atom the academy said of the physics 
laureates work 
their experiments showed definitively that there were smaller 
nuclear particles than protons and neutrons said professor 
cecelia jareskog of the academy 
in the future she said we will be able to see even finer 
details maybe there is something inside the quark 
friedman 60 of chicago and kendall 63 of boston are 
professors at the massachusetts institute of technology taylor 
60 born in medicine hat alberta is a professor at stanford 
university 
the discovery was made during research begun in 1967 at mit and 
stanford using stanfords linear accelerator an atom smasher 
that produces highspeed collisions of subatomic particles in an 
effort to discern their properties and structure 
friedman reached in fort worth texas said he was very very 
overwhelmed at winning the nobel 
he said the research began with a study of protons 
to our surprise we found that the scattering of electrons 
from protons behaved in a way that suggested that there were 
pointlike objects inside little nuggets inside they were later 
identified as being compatible with there being quarks he 
said 
it was the first experimental evidence that quarks existed and 
confirmed earlier theories friedman said 
asked the meaning of the research he said it contributed to the 
understanding of how nature works 
he added one never knows what the application of basic 
research will be knowing what the structure of matter is 
ultimately has to have some effect on how you model the entire 
structure of things 
taylor contacted at home in stanford calif said he was 
surprised to learn he had won the prize its a great honor he 
said 
taylor said he was most influenced by wkh panofsky former 
director of the stanford linear acceleration center it was his 
vision and hard work that generated the accelerator to do the 
experiment he said i think of him as directly responsible 
kendall said of winning the nobel i think the prize means 
recognition for what has been an important experiment in physics 
it was done 20 years ago so i found it delightful and 
unexpected 
kendall has been chairman of the union of concerned scientists 
since 1973 
corey 62 of harvard university has synthesized about 100 
important drugs and other natural products the academy said 
coreys method of synthesizing chemicals is called 
retrosynthetic analysis to make biological molecules in the 
laboratory he analyzes their structure and works backward to 
identify simpler molecules he needs to construct them 
it is one of the prerequisites of our civilization the 
academy said of coreys work the field has been rewarded with the 
nobel prize seven times before 
the nobel prizes were endowed in the 1896 will of alfred nobel 
the inventor of dynamite the physics and chemistry prizes were the 
last awarded this year 
this week soviet president mikhail s gorbachev won the peace 
prize and americans harry markowitz merton miller and william 
sharpe won the nobel memorial prize in economics 
last week mexican poet and essayist octavio paz won the prize in 
literature and americans joseph e murray and e donnall thomas won 
the prize for medicine 
the prizes will be presented dec 10 the anniversary of nobels 
death

three british men made a dramatic desert escape from iraq 
diplomats reported wednesday and secretary of state james a baker 
iii said saddam hussein must fail if peace is to succeed in the 
persian gulf 
the escape by the three britons was the first reported by 
westerners since three britons and two frenchmen made their way out 
of iraq by sea earlier this month 
thousands of westerners are being held by the iraqi president in 
iraq and kuwait with some of them serving as human shields 
against potential attacks on key installations by the multinational 
force assembled in the gulf region 
western diplomatic sources in saudi arabia speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the three britons arrived near the 
saudi town of arar late monday in order to avoid endangering 
others who might try to get out the same way they did not say how 
the men evaded iraqi patrols or provide details about their route 
in baghdad iraqi officials conceded wednesday that global 
sanctions imposed to punish iraq for its invasion of kuwait were 
beginning to have an effect 
there is not enough milk for the newborn babies and the 
blockade has affected nourishment of expectant mothers hamad 
saleh alrawi president of the iraqi bar association said in a 
statement released in baghdad wednesday 
the government has listed milk along with rice wheat sugar 
cooking oil tea soap detergent and beans as items in short 
supply and subject to rationing 
defense secretary dick cheney meanwhile held a closeddoor 
meeting with soviet president mikhail gorbachev and their 
discussion reportedly touched on the 12weekold gulf conflic 
the talks came as moscow was calling for redoubled efforts to 
find a diplomatic solution to the crisis 
a soviet envoy was to travel to washington on thursday for a 
meeting with president bush after talks in france and italy on the 
crisis soviet officials have said the envoy yevgeny primakov was 
stressing gorbachevs hopes for a peaceful settlement 
in another development britain made an angry new protest to 
iraq over treatment of its diplomats its foreign office said 
wednesday that iraq had withdrawn diplomatic accreditation from 
eight british diplomats evacuated from britains embassy in kuwait 
to baghdad 
after the takeover of kuwait iraq ordered all foreign missions 
in the emirate to close most diplomats have been forced to leave 
because iraqi occupation forces cut off food water and electricity 
to their embassies 
the only western embassies still open are the british american 
canadian and french missions 
the foreign office summoned iraqs ambassador to protest what it 
called a flagrant disregard for international law in 
withdrawing the envoys accreditation it said 
the decision not to accord them diplomatic status means they 
are seen as ordinary british male citizens who are not allowed to 
leave said a spokesman 
un officials said wednesday that iraq had refused permission 
for a kuwaiti flight to the conquered emirate to bring medicine for 
kuwaitis and stranded foreigners 
kuwaits governmentinexile had asked secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar to seek permission for the flight to land un 
spokesman francois giuliani said the request was rebuffed tuesday 
via iraqs mission to the un 
the united nations has taken an unprecedented series of steps 
against iraq since the aug 2 invasion including the approval of a 
global economic embargo 
baker in testimony before the senate foreign relations 
committee denounced iraqi aggression for a second day running 
we cannot allow this violent way to become the wave of the 
future in the middle east he told the panel saddam hussein 
mr chairman must fail if peace is to succeed the prospects for a 
just and lasting peace will be shattered if he prevails 
a day earlier baker rejected any concession to baghdad saying 
the united states will settle for nothing less than a complete 
iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
baker told the committee that president bush would consult with 
congress about military moves in the gulf but resisted calls for 
what he called a more formal mechanism 
sen richard lugar rind said military action against iraq 
was more likely now and that congress which has a recess upcoming 
should come back into session to authorize a declaration of war if 
one were needed 
in moscow cheney told soviet lawmakers that us and soviet 
military strategy now calls for a reduction in the forces once 
arrayed against one another and a focus on regional 
contingencies such as the gulf conflict 
us and soviet sources said the content of cheneys closeddoor 
talks with gorbachev was similar 
also wednesday the tehran times reported that iran has 
appointed an ambassador to iraq the move came three days after the 
two countries announced the reopening of embassies closed during 
their eightyear war 
saddam moved to make peace with iran after the invasion of 
kuwait although the fighting had stopped two years earlier iraq 
had thousands of troops tied up along its border with iran and in 
iranian territory before its peace initiative

illinois rep henry hyde apologized on 
wednesday for derogatory remarks he made earlier about rep barney 
franks sexuality 
the exchange between hyde and frank who is homosexual began 
when frank a massachusetts democrat berated the republicans for 
flipflopping on taxes 
he said he wasnt in the chamber but read in the congressional 
record that 10 days ago someone passing himself off as the 
republican leader urged a vote for new taxes but tuesday said 
taxes should not be raised 
frank said sarcastically there must be a security problem in the 
house that allowed an impostor to speak for republican leader 
robert michel 
that caused hyde to jump to his feet to blast the democratic 
package of higher taxes and budget cuts as an attack on the middle 
class 
he said the reason frank hadnt heard michel was because he 
was in the gymnasium doing whatever he does in the gymnasium and he 
wasnt available 
the remark was a reference to unsubstantiated allegations by a 
male prostitute that he had sexual relations with frank in the 
house gymnasium 
im appalled that you would make the remarks that you made 
rep craig washington dtexas said to hyde great minds think 
about ideas average minds think about things and small minds talk 
about people 
what business do you have mentioning the personal matters of 
any member of congress what difference does it make whether 
someone is in the gymnasium 
minutes later washington went to the republican side of the 
chamber to speak directly to hyde rep ron dellums dcalif also 
had words with the republican 
in moments hyde was on his feet apologizing to frank 
i was out of line he said what i said was in anger one 
should never speak in anger it was out of line i would like my 
words physically removed from the record 
frank accepted the apology

mendoza 22 told jail officials he was an organizer of a drug 
abuse resistance education run from yakima to sunnyside on 
saturday 
county dare officer deputy jeff gillespie said mendoza had 
contacted him suggesting such a fundraising run several weeks ago 
but had never followed up gillespie said the program which

congressional negotiators reached a tentative 
accord wednesday on controlling emissions toxic industrial 
chemicals leaving them only one big step away from agreement on a 
costly new clean air law 
still on the table was the question of how to deal with acid 
rain the last barrier to the first major overhaul of national air 
pollution law in 13 years 
wednesdays agreement represents the first time the government 
would require businesses to make dramatic reductions in the more 
than 24 billion pounds of 189 hazardous chemicals including many 
cancercausing agents released yearly into the air 
reductions would be required not just from factories refineries 
and chemical plants but also from smaller businesses such as dry 
cleaners and furniture refinishers and even from garbage 
incinerators 
sen david durenberger rminn who led senate negotiators on 
the industrial emissions section of the bill said he believed an 
acid rain agreement could be reached by the end of the week 
rep gerry sikorski dminn said he expects attempts by 
midwest lawmakers to push for additional measures to reduce the 
cost of meeting new acid rain controls but he said negotiators of 
all points of view who want to get a bill enacted into law will 
not put up with a lot of grandstanding at this point 
wednesdays compromise followed long closeddoor negotiations 
often late into the night against the deadline of an oct 26 
adjournment that began last weekend and for a time were bogged 
down over whether to give the steel industry additional time to 
comply with the new pollution controls 
it was agreed to give steel companies another 20 years to the 
year 2020 to cut cancercausing emissions from coke ovens the 
industry had argued the ovens would be forced to shut down without 
the extension 
the negotiations immediately turned to the bills acid rain 
provision which would require electric utilities to cut annual 
emissions of sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons by the end of the 
decade 
the bush administration has estimated the bill if enacted 
would cost the economy between 21 billion and 25 billion a year 
once fully in effect environmentalists argue much of that amount 
will be gained in reduced health care costs from cleaner air 
congressional sources said wednesday that while some minor 
issues remained to be worked out house and senate members agreed 
on requiring industry to install new equipment aimed at cutting 
toxic emissions from large factories by 90 percent over the next 
decade 
toxic chemical emissions from smaller polluters would be reduced 
by about 75 percent the emissions cuts would be achieved by 
requiring companies to install the most effective pollution control 
technology available for a particular industry 
under the compromise the environmental protection agency also 
would be required to direct polluters to take additional measures 
after the turn of the century if the agency determines people near 
industrial plants are not being assured of an ample margin of 
safety against cancercausing pollution 
if those assurances are not met plants could be closed 
the legislation would regulate more than 250 types of pollution 
sources in addition the compromise would for the first time 
require new safeguards and response programs in the event of 
accidental releases of toxic chemicals 
both the house and senate approved clean air bills by a wide 
margin earlier this year but the conference committee negotiations 
aimed at resolving differences in the bills has at times slowed to 
a virtual standstill 
a breaktrough came oct 10 when the two sides reached agreement 
on measures to reduce smogcausing pollution from automobiles and 
trucks

critics attacked president mikhail s gorbachevs 
toneddown economic reform plan on wednesday and an architect of a 
more radical transition program protested the retreat by offering 
his resignation 
the reaction came two days after gorbachev won the nobel peace 
prize and the day after he unveiled his comparatively slow plan for 
building a westernstyle market economy in the soviet union 
grigory yavlinsky coauthor of the original 500day plan 
offered his resignation as deputy prime minister of russia the 
largest of the 15 soviet republics 
in a speech to the russian parliament which adopted the 500day 
plan on sept 11 yavlinsky did not mention gorbachev by name but 
he predicted the presidents reforms would set off disastrous price 
increases 
the market will be entered in this situation not through 
economic stabilization but through growing inflation he said 
all that the 500day program and i personally promised in 
living standards cannot be achieved now 
boris yeltsin president of russia and gorbachevs main 
political rival on tuesday criticized the presidents plan 
calling it a catastrophe that is doomed to fail within 
months 
leaders in the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia 
have shown little willingness to go along with the national reform 
plan their regional economies are more westernized and efficient 
than the rest of the soviet system and they have announced their 
desire both for political independence and rapid moves toward free 
enterprise 
several other republics particularly georgia and the ukraine 
also are pushing for autonomy and may reject gorbachevs plan 
approval of gorbachevs plan is not even certain in the national 
legislature which is scheduled to begin debating it friday two 
legislators told the associated press they doubted it would pass 
its not detailed enough it doesnt go far enough said one 
of the lawmakers who spoke on condition they not be identified 
gorbachevs plan is an attempt to merge the radical 500day plan 
drafted by economists headed by yavlinsky and economist stanislav 
shatalin with several other proposals including a far more 
conservative plan presented by prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov 
yavlinsky 38 accused ryzhkovs cabinet of putting the 
conservative plan into effect through the back door while the 
national legislature engaged in endless delays in choosing a 
reform program the russian parliament voted last month to proceed 
on its own with the 500day plan but has yet to take concrete 
steps to do so 
yavlinsky formally tendered his resignation to the russian 
lawmakers but they postponed acting on it 
this was a speech by a hotheaded youth not a mature 
statesman said the republics prime minister ivan silayev who 
urged the parliament to reject the resignation 
gorbachev is scheduled to defend his plan in a speech to the 
national legislature on friday the 542member supreme soviet could 
vote on it as early as saturday although some lawmakers said a 
longer debate was likely 
the fourstage gorbachev plan would begin by reducing the 
national budget deficit now about 100 billion and cutting the 
money supply which has grown rapidly in recent years spurring 
inflation 
western experts estimate soviets have saved billions of dollars 
worth of rubles in banks or under their mattresses because there 
is little to buy in state stores 
efforts also would be made in the first stage to improve 
production of consumer goods now in short supply and to boost 
agricultural output through land reform 
each republic would be allowed to decide whether to break 
collective farms into private plots in the second stage at an 
unspecified date prices on roughly 70 percent of all goods and 
services would be freed to respond to market forces the central 
government would continue to set prices on fuel key raw materials 
and necessities such as bread milk and sugar 
small private businesses also would be encouraged during the 
second stage and a social welfare net would be established to help 
workers who lose their jobs 
the third stage would emphasize establishing a free market for 
housing a modern banking system and entrepreneurship 
the final stage would end government monopolies in many 
industries and allow the ruble to be freely traded against other 
world currencies encouraging foreign investment in the soviet 
union 
unlike the 500day plan gorbachevs proposal contains no time 
schedule it says that similar transitions in other countries have 
taken 1 to 2 years 
growing shortages of staples such as meat gasoline and paper 
have eroded public support for gorbachev and skepticism over his 
plan appears widespread 
i think in the existing situation all the plans for economic 
reform are unrealistic said ninel ilyicheva 55 a publishing 
house worker i dont see that gorbachev is really accomplishing 
anything i only hear him talk and talk and talk all the time 
vladimir orlov 46 a soviet army major said he considers 
gorbachev a smart person who hasnt said his final word yet 
on the economy

after a fivemonth absence the soviet union 
has bought some us corn for delivery by the end of the year the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
officials said private exporting companies sold 350000 metric 
tons to the soviets under terms of the current longterm supply 
agreement between the two countries no prices or other details 
were disclosed 
the pact including a threemonth extension expires dec 31 a 
new fiveyear agreement will begin at that time 
although the soviet union recently bought some us soybean 
meal it had not purchased significant quantities of wheat or corn 
since last may department officials have speculated moscow delayed 
purchases to see how 1990 harvests turned out in both the soviet 
union and the united states 
other factors mentioned have included russian hard currency 
problems the direction of us farm legislation and whether the 
united states might extend credit 
rumors have circulated in the grain trade for weeks that the 
soviet union was or soon would be in the market for more us corn 
market prices have been under pressure from this falls huge 
harvest estimated by the department at 802 billion bushels up 7 
percent from the 1989 crop 
large sales to foreign buyers must be reported daily to usda by 
exporters 
sales of wheat and corn to the soviet union for delivery during 
the year that ended sept 30 totaled 203 million tons including 
nearly 165 million tons of corn and more than 38 million tons of 
wheat 
in addition the soviets in 198990 bought 342300 tons of 
soybeans 137 million tons of soybean meal and 7300 tons of 
barley 
the 350000 tons reported wednesday were the first corn sales 
for the threemonth extension although soybean meal sales amount 
to 355000 tons 
a metric ton of 2205 pounds is equivalent to 394 bushels of 
corn thus the 350000 tons would be about 138 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 223 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usdas fiveday average thus the latest 
sale could have a farm value of about 31 million

classroom boycotts forced the resignation wednesday of the prime 
minister of the ukraine the second most populous soviet republic

in the separatist movement in the ukraine known as the soviet 
breadbasket 
the ukrainian parliament also passed a resolution embracing 
other student demands including the transfer of ownership of 
communist party property to the government and refusal to sign a 
new treaty of union proposed by soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
the state news agency tass reported 
the parliament earlier proclaimed ukraines right to overrule 
national laws and barred ukrainian youths drafted by the soviet 
military from serving outside the republic 
the unrest in the ukraine and criticism of gorbachevs economic 
program struck new blows at the soviet presidents attempts to 
maintain a semblance of central authority 
radicals have rejected gorbachevs proposed treaty of union 
which would redefine political and economic links among the 15 
republics nearly all of which have declared some form of 
sovereignty from the central government 
yeltsin and others want the republics to negotiate forms of 
cooperation among themselves 
tens of thousands of students in the ukrainian capital of kiev 
celebrated their victory by marching wednesday evening through 
october revolution square which they renamed independence square

government move faster to achieve independence from the soviet 
union

the israeli government and its influential 
lobby find themselves in an awkward position they oppose a move by 
a number of proisraeli senators to block a 75 billion arms sale 
to saudi arabia 
the senators led by alan cranston dcalif and bob packwood 
rore submitted a resolution opposing the sale hours after 
leaders of the american israel public affairs committee urged them 
to back off said sources familiar with the affair 
this is the first time that proisrael forces have ever tried 
to block opposition to a major arms sale to one of israels 
enemies said one capitol hill source 
the administration last month notified congress that it plans to 
sell the saudis 754 billion in tanks antitank missiles rocket 
launchers apache gunships and other weapons deemed necessary to 
block an attack from iraq if congress doesnt oppose the deal by 
oct 27 it goes into effect 
the administration is banking on support for its antiiraq 
policy to push the sale through congress where proisraeli 
lawmakers probably would have balked at the unprecedented sale to 
an arab state 
the state department reasoned that lawmakers would be unpopular 
with their constituents if they opposed selling weapons to a 
country where more than 150000 american troops are deployed 
israel and its lobbyists in washington have objected often 
successfully to every major saudi arms sale in the past decade 
building an almost legendary reputation of influence in the 
process 
but aipac bowing to reality decided to hold its fire until the 
administration presents to congress a second package for the saudis 
next january sources said 
that proposal estimated at over 10 billion is expected to 
include the latest f15 jet fighters and is of significantly 
greater concern to israel and its supporters than the largely 
landbased arsenal being proposed now 
were concerned about both deals said aipac spokeswoman 
toby dershowitz were working with congress and the 
administration to satisfy the concerns about saudi needs in this 
crisis and israels security needs she said 
the lobbys strategy to withhold opposition to the first sale 
also grew out of concern about jeopardizing various proposals in 
the house and senate to help israel get millions of dollars in 
emergency weapons against a threatened iraqi attack 
a delegation of jewish leaders went to secretary of defense dick 
cheney last month and promised him it would not oppose this current 
sale similar assurances were given by aipac to the state 
departments policy planner dennis ross and one of the jewish 
communitys top leaders max fisher paid a call on president bush 
and offered his support too 
imagine then the administrations surprise when it discovered 
last week a welladvanced plan by a group of senators to oppose 
large portions of the saudi sale 
but when ross called aipac director tom dine to complain he was 
in for an even bigger surprise aipac which has been credited by 
critics and supporters alike for having vast pull in congress 
didnt know about the lawmakers plan the sources said 
aipac denies dine was surprised weve been in consultation 
with the congress all along on the best way to achieve our mutual 
objectives said dershowitz 
alan cranston did this on his own said the senators 
spokesman murray flander he didnt consult aipac 
dine worried that aipacs credibility was on the line went to 
see cranston and asked him to desist another aipac leader called 
packwood sources said 
but cranston objected and submitted his resolution of 
disapproval of the saudi sale along with cosponsors packwood 
arlen specter rpa frank lautenberg dnj and paul simon 
dill 
on the senate floor cranston asked if the idea is to sell the 
saudis what they need now to deter iraq why is the administration 
proposing to sell them 150 mia2 tanks which havent been built yet 
and wont be delivered until 1993 
in addition cranston argued the weapons could fall into enemy 
hands in the volatile region as did us arms in kuwait 
furthermore cranston said we may as momentary brothers in 
arms forget who the saudis consider to be their real longtime 
irreconcilable enemies namely israel 
reps david obey dwis and mel levine dcalif also 
introduced a resolution seeking to turn down the patriots 150 m1a2 
tanks and 12 apaches about 45 billion of the 75 billion 
package 
the sales obey said wednesday would accelerate the arms race 
in the middle east caldron which already has massive amounts of 
advanced military weapons and equipment 
aides to cranston say he is waiting to see whether the senate 
adopts a host of measures designed to provide israel with as much 
as 1 billion in weapons before deciding whether to forge ahead 
with the antisaudi resolution 
senior lawmakers including appropriations committee chairman 
robert byrd dwva have serious concerns about the proisrael 
amendment however and may seek to kill it said congressional 
sources

federal prison inmates soon will be required 
to attend classes until they can read at the 12thgrade level and 
complete a highschool equivalency degree the justice department 
said wednesday 
if they refuse to do so they will be consigned to the 
lowestpaying prison jobs and they could be subjected to 
disciplinary actions the department said 
federal prisoners are currently required to attend classes if 
they cannot read or perform math problems at the eighthgrade 
level under the higher standards inmates will be required to 
master 12thgrade academic skills by attending prison classes the 
department said 
tougher literacy standards are intended to raise the chance that 
inmates will not return to crime once they are released from 
prison 
for most who cannot read competing in the legitimate work 
world is impossible attorney general dick thornburgh said in 
remarks prepared for delivery to an international conference on 
prison literacy in ottawa 
we live in a complex world and the pressure of competition 
for goodpaying jobs and indeed success in virtually every aspect 
of modern life hinges on literacy thornburgh said 
the higher standards are being imposed at a time when 20 percent 
of the 58000 federal inmates cannot read at the eighthgrade level 
and 40 percent have a hitory of drug or alcohol abuse the 
education department says up to 30 million us adults are 
illiterate 
we believe there is a straightline relationship between 
literacy levels and an individuals likelihood of involvement in 
substance abuse thornburgh said 
many former inmates who cannot read turn to drug abuse as an 
escape or else come to rely on selling drugs to survive 
thornburgh said 
the bureau of prisons began the mandatory literacy program in 
the early 1980s inmates who did not pass tests of sixthgrade 
reading and math skills were required to attend classes the 
standard was raised later to mastery of eighthgrade skills 
the 12thgrade standard now being enforced as part of a pilot 
program at 10 facilities will take effect throughout the federal 
prison system early next year said gregory l bogdan a bureau of 
prisons spokesman 
under the old policy all federal prisoners must take the 
reading and math skills tests no matter what degrees they may have 
earned bogdan said under the new policy inmates who can document 
that they have at least a high school diploma will not have to take 
any tests and will be exempt from the class requirement he said 
inmates are required to attend classes for 90 days those who 
refuse to do so could face disciplinary action such as loss of 
privileges additional work hours and possible transfer to an 
institution with a higher level of security bogdan said although 
he added im not aware of anyone thats ever refused to that 
extent 
inmates who attend classes for 90 days but refuse to continue 
after that will be consigned to earning the lowest wages in prison 
jobs said bogdan who once worked as a teacher and principal of 
the school at the lewisburg pa federal penitentiary 
our job in the education department was to motivate these 
guys force the exposure to academic subjects bogdan said 
inmates also are required to work while in prison either as 
clerks and orderlies or in the federal prison industries program 
inmates earn between 11 cents and 36 cents an hour doing ordinary 
prison jobs but can earn as much as 105 an hour in prison 
industry jobs 
but prisoners who refuse to attend school classes cant earn 
more than 11 cents an hour in menial jobs or 44 cents an hour in 
prison industry bogdan said 
there are also other incentives for completing the program he 
said 
an inmate who becomes eligible for parole would not want any 
comments about disciplinary actions to be seen by the parole board 
he said 
class attendance also would enhance an inmates chances to be 
placed in a halfway house toward the end of a prison sentence 
bogdan said 
last year 10546 federal inmates completed eighthgrade 
requirements and 3100 finished highschool equivalency programs 
thornburgh said another 1781 finished programs that taught 
english as a second language 
a total of 15000 federal inmates were enrolled last year in 
continuing education classes the attorney general said 
there is a general consensus that basic literacy not only 
helps the prisoner after release but equally important 
contributes to a better life while in prison and to a safer 
environment for both staff an inmates thornburgh said 
the 10 prisons participating in the pilot literacy program are

three auto consumer groups asked americans on 
wednesday to refuse to buy any car not equipped with air bags they 
chastised most japanese automakers for lagging behind us and 
european counterparts in plans to install the crashprotection 
devices 
chrysler which is providing drivers air bags in virtually all 
of its 1991 cars drew a limited salute from the three groups 
motor voters the center for auto safety and the us public 
interest research group 
but even chrysler was faulted for not equipping its popular 
minivans with air bags and for not moving more quickly to make 
them standard equipment for frontseat passengers in cars 
the three consumer organizations staged news conferences and 
demonstrations in 12 cities to propose the boycott and focused 
their ire on japanese economy models 
rosemary dunlap president of motor voters noted that many 
automakers equip their luxury vehicles with air bags but not the 
lowerpriced ones claiming the 320 devices would drive away 
bargain hunters 
but chrysler she noted has several economy models variations 
of the dodge shadow and plymouth sundance with driver air bags as 
standard equipment if chrysler can put air bags in a car for 
under 8000 whats hondas excuse for leaving them out of the 
civic crx which costs over 11000 she asked 
honda has announced it will make air bags standard equipment in 
all cars in 1994 currently the only hondabuilt car sold in the 
united states with air bags is the topoftheline acura legend 
retailing for over 20000 
according to industry projections for the current model year 45 
percent of fords cars and 33 percent of general motors cars will 
be sold with at least a driver air bag six companies bmw isuzu 
mercedesbenz porsche saab and volvo equip all their us cars 
with air bags while five others hyundai peugeot suzuki 
sterling and yugo have no such models 
the figure for toyota is 27 percent for nissan 20 percent for 
mazda 15 percent and for mitsubishi 1 percent 
as of this year federal law required all cars to be equipped 
with frontseat passive restraints meaning either air bags or 
motorized shoulder harnesses the exception is that if a driver air 
bag is installed the automaker is free to wait until 1994 to equip 
the same model with a passenger bag meanwhile that car can be 
marketed with normal seat and shoulder beats on the passengers 
side 
the japanese auto industrys threeyear delay in installing 
air bags condemns over 7500 americans to death and another 125000 
to serious injury said clarence ditlow director of the center 
for auto safety 
air bags are lifesavers there is no good reason why 
consumers should be forced to choose between safety and economy 
said lucinda sikes an attorney for us pirg we are calling 
for air bags in economical as well as luxury models for the front 
seat passenger as well as the driver and in light trucks and 
minivans as well as passenger cars

former east german secret police are 
responsible for a scam that raked in 2 billion from the two 
germanys july 1 monetary union the newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung 
reported wednesday 
the newspaper which cited berlin justice state secretary 
wolfgang schomburg as its source telexed its report to other news 
organizations in advance of thursdays publication 
the fraud scheme was first revealed on tuesday 
officials said then that four people were arrested for allegedly 
bilking the bonn government of 333 million by falsifying trade 
accounts to qualify for a conversion of transfer rubles into german 
marks 
the german mark became east germanys official currency on july 
1 
the sueddeutsche zeitung with headquarters in munich quoted 
schomburg as saying the actual amount that was swindled is closer 
to 2 billion 
he also said that three of the four suspects belonged to a 
special detail of the nowdisbanded stasi secret police the 
daily reported 
government officials believe the fraud started after suspects 
presented the german foreign trade bank in berlin with false 
documents purportedly showing exports of east german goods to east 
european nations 
that apparently qualified the suspects to receive a special rate 
for converting transfer rubles into german marks

the senate has passed a bill directing the 
government to pay 35 million to the seneca indians admitting that 
congress wrongly forced the tribe to lease its land for 115 years 
to the city of salamanca ny 
we took advantage of the seneca nation and now we ought to 
correct this injustice said sen daniel p moynihan dny who 
introduced the bill in the senate along with sen alfonse damato 
rny 
the senate passed the measure by voice vote late tuesday the 
bill originally sponsored by rep amo houghton rny passed the 
house on oct 10 
administration officials however have said the government is 
not financially liable for the low rents paid to the senecas and 
they oppose the measure because of its cost president bush has 10 
days in which to sign it veto it or simply allow it to pass into 
law unsigned 
the bill would ratify an agreement reached by salamanca three 
nearby villages and the seneca nation to replace a 99year lease 
accord expiring feb 19 1991 
the lease arrangements date to the 1860s and 70s when whites 
moved onto seneca lands in western new york to work on railroads 
and drill for oil they leased the land at extremely low rents from 
individual senecas 
in 1875 congress confirmed these leases despite their dubious 
legality fifteen years later congress extended the leases for 99 
years with no provision to raise the rents 
thus about 85 percent of the city of salamanca is leased from 
the senecas at rents that were frozen as low as 1 per year 
under the bill the federal government would pay 35 million to 
the tribe to make up for some of its financial loss the state of 
new york must also pay 25 million which will require state 
legislation

harvard professor elias james corey 
cracked open his fortune cookie at a chinese restaurant last week 
and read the good news you will soon receive a high prize or 
award 
wednesday the news materialized via a graduate student he had 
won the nobel prize in chemistry 
a few miles down the charles river two scientists at the 
massachusetts institute of technology on wednesday learned they had 
won the award in physics 
corey a harvard professor since 1959 won for work in organic 
synthesis his experiments helped make hundreds of medications more 
readily available and affordable 
jerome i friedman and henry w kendall both of mit won for 
proving the existence of quarks particles smaller than a proton or 
a neutron 
they shared the award with richard e taylor a canadian 
scientist at stanford university in california the three had 
delved into the heart of the atom in experiments conducted at the 
stanford linear accelerator center in the late 1960s and early 
70s 
each nobel is worth about 700000 
at harvard young chemists popped open beer cans and applauded 
corey as he emerged from his office wednesday morning 
it never occurred to me id be a professor the 62yearold 
son of lebanese immigrants told a news conference ones 
expectations were not very high of course i never would have 
dreamed i would be so successful 
but mit professor john sheehan knew corey was headed for 
greatness 
he was an excellent student sheehan said he had a little 
something special something extra 
the three physicists were recognized for work that has helped 
scientists understand the basic structure of the universe 
their experiments with the atom and its smaller components have 
given scientists a better understanding of the way the world is 
put together said eugene mollove a mit science writer the 
discovery became the basic model of particle physics 
as human beings we have great curiosity about how nature 
works said friedman 60 who lives in the boston suburb of 
brookline knowing the structure of matter ultimately has to have 
some effect on how you model the entire structure of things 
friedman learned of the award when his wife woke him with the 
news 
i thought i was still asleep and dreaming he said from a 
hotel in fort worth texas where he was attending a conference 
friedman stepped down as head of the mit physics department this 
year to pursue teaching and research 
kendall joked that it was very civilized of the nobel 
committee to phone him with the news at 5 am 
he said the work was done during the golden age of 
governmental subsidies for science 
it was done 20 years ago so i found it delightful and 
unexpected kendall said 
kendall 63 who lives in the boston suburb of sharon has been 
chairman of the union of concerned scientists since 1973 the group 
has opposed weapons such as the b2 stealth bomber and called for 
more safety precautions at nuclear power plants 
hes a rare breed of scientist whos been able to come out of 
the laboratory and work quite vigorously for the benefit of 
humankind said howard ris the unions executive director 
isnt it wonderful for once when two guys who werent working 
to get it got the prize said martin deutsch an emeritus 
professor at mit they did their work because they wanted to know 
about the world 
taylor contacted at his stanford calif home wednesday 
morning said he was surprised to hear the group had received the 
prize taylor 60 was born in medicine hat alberta is a stanford 
university professor 
taylor said he was asleep when he got the good news in a 
telephone call about 4 am one thing thats remarkable is how 
little you say when the conversation starts with the secretary of 
the academy in sweden

leaders of the antiabortion group operation 
rescue burned a court order on the steps of the us courthouse on 
wednesday accusing the judge who signed it of violating their 
constitutional rights 
us district judge louis oberdorfer ruled oct 4 that any 
organization or individual that pays the bills of operation rescue 
is liable for fines resulting from antiabortion protests that 
violate a permanent injunction the judge issued earlier this year 
oberdorfer issued the order after attorneys for the national 
organization for women and planned parenthood of america produced 
evidence that operation rescue kept donations in bank accounts of 
allied organizations 
randall terry the groups leader called oberdorfers latest 
order a frontal assault on freedom of association 
the judge is in the hip pocket of the abortion industry 
terry said 
in july oberdorfer had held operation rescue and several of its 
organizers in contempt of a preliminary injunction that prohibited 
demonstrators from blocking the entrances to local abortion clinics 
during protests last november 
oberdorfer made the injunction permanent in january 
operation rescue has been the subject of numerous court 
injunctions around the country barring antiabortion protesters 
from interfering with the operation of abortion clinics 
for violating oberdorfers injunction the group was ordered to 
pay 6013 in damages to three local abortion clinics plus 
attorneys fees which have tentatively been set at 42000 
as a result of oberdorfers latest order terry vowed to take 
the organization underground by closing its national 
headquarters in binghamton ny and its bank accounts 
we will keep doing everything that we are doing terry said 
but the group will function without a national office that just 
sits there as a target for these harassing lawsuits 
we will become a moving target he said 
terry also invited supporters to attend three days of 
antiabortion protests in the nations capital nov 1517 that he 
called dc project ii 
terry declined to say if protesters would block the entrances to 
abortion clinics as they did during last years dc project 
but the leaflet distributed by operation rescue referred to 
childsaving activity 
nows attorney laurence j eisenstein said there is no 
doubt these same people who were held in contempt once intend to 
be held in contempt again 
it is clear they intend to engage in the hiding of assets 
which this order is meant to prevent eisenstein said 
patricia ireland the executive vice president of now replied 
in a statement that with his penchant for martyrdom randall 
terry would like the courts and the press to believe that operation 
rescue has been crippled by unjust fines 
todays showboating is yet another attempt to duck the groups 
responsibility for repeat violations of the law ireland said 
they are playing shell games with their assets in an attempt to 
avoid vines that they do not wish to pay 
eisenstein said he had produced evidence in civil depositions 
that money donated to operation rescue had been turned over to the 
prolife trust fund other donations had been given on operation 
rescues behalf to the committee to protect the family foundation 
which eisenstein said has paid at least 80000 of the groups 
bills this year 
much of the 43500 that was put in a prolife trust bank 
account earlier this year was in the form of checks made out to 
operation rescue and endorsed by terry eisenstein said

solidarity leader lech walesa appeared to 
upstage his presidential rival wednesday when he campaigned in 
tadeusz mazowieckis home turf and was greeted by larger crowds 
than met mazowieki a few days earlier 
traveling to southern poland from his home in the baltic city of 
gdansk the solidarity leader told crowds at several stops that 
after battling to end communist rule he was ready to help build a 
capitalist future 
as i was able to overcome communism together with you now i 
am inviting you to help with building walesa told about 20000 
cheering supporters in the market square 
mazowiecki and walesa were allies in solidarity the movement 
that drove the communists from power but walesa began to complain 
shortly after mazowiecki became prime minister in 1989 that he 
wasnt moving fast enough 
walesa decided to run for president and after communist 
president wojciech jaruzelski agreed to step down this fall 
mazowiecki announced he would run against walesa the election is 
nov 25 
in his stop wednesday walesa gave crowds in the medieval city 
what they wanted to hear he would clean up grimy historic 
monuments to try to restore the beautiful stonework and sculptures 
speaking at the sendzimir steel mill in nowa huta formerly the 
lenin steel mill he told workers their inefficient polluting 
plant might have to close but alternative jobs must be found he 
said 
everyone must stop and think because 28000 people are 
employed here said walesa those 28000 people must have jobs 
lets sit down and find something i dont believe there is no 
solution 
mazowiecki edited the krakowbased monthly wiez for decades and 
is linked to the progressive catholic znak publishing house in 
krakow 
but walesa arriving in the city three days after mazowiecki 
kicked off his campaign here appeared to receive at least one 
crowd that was much larger than the one that sent off mazowiecki 
at his hourlong marketsquare rally walesa was applauded after 
virtually every answer offered to the questions shouted from the 
crowd 
walesa also held a 30minute meeting with krakow intellectuals 
at the national museum and appealed for their support leading 
polish intellectuals have largely deserted his workerbased union 
and rallied around mazowiecki 
passing through the city i felt the strength of workers and 
here i want to feel the strength of your minds i want to be wise 
with your wisdom and strong with your strength he said 
earlier walesa was feted at the town hall where banners 
announed i prefer lech and was made an honorary citizen of the 
city 
krakow was polands capital until the end of the 16th century 
spared by world war iis devastation its medieval monuments 
include the wawel castle and cathedral with the tombs of kings 
queens and national heroes 
but pollution from the industrial silesia region and the nowa 
huta mill built by the communists in the 1950s as part of a crash 
industrialization program have corroded and begrimed the old 
monuments 
walesa also lay flowers at a simple monument in nowa huta for 
bogdan wlosik a teenage protester allegedly beated to death by 
police in 1982 when polands communist government had imposed 
martial law

president vaclav havel relieved 
defense minister miroslav vacek of his duties on wednesday and 
temporarily entrusted the defense portfolio to the prime minister 
the state ctk news agency said 
vacek 55 a career soldier and longtime communist party member 
had served as deputy defense minister under former communist 
premier ladislav adamec 
wednesdays terse report gave no details or reasons for havels 
decision but it quoted parliament deputy michael kocab as saying 
the president realized it was high time for a civilian to head 
the defense ministry 
havels office declined comment 
interim defense duties were transferred to premier marian calfa 
vacek later said on national television i fully agree that it 
is suitable that i resign 
but he added that the reservations some people had toward my 
person do not contribute to the peace and atmosphere necessary for 
carrying out complex changes above all in the economic sphere 
after thanking havel for supporting him through his nearly 
11month tenure vacek urged czechoslovaks to change their attitude 
toward the army 
if you cannot love it then as a start at least abandon the 
grudge he said 
vacek played a major role in forming the coalition government 
of national understanding under calfa after czechoslovakias 
peaceful revolution last november it was the first government here 
in 41 years not dominated by communists 
vacek was appointed defense minister on dec 3 1989 and left 
the communist party three months later 
the president voiced his appreciation that army gen miroslav 
vacek did not permit the abuse of the army against the people by 
anyone ctk said referring to the november revolution 
but according to the agency kocab said havels decision was 
based on findings of a presidential commission set up on sept 10 
to investigate military activities during the november revolution 
the commission is expected to submit its report thursday 
unconfirmed reports say the army was to have been used against 
the people who overthrew the communist leadership through peaceful 
street demonstrations 
ctk said havel also expressed his appreciation that vacek 
loyally fulfilled all orders and initiated the process of 
fundamental restructuring of the czechoslovak army 
some politicians blasted vaceks appointment as defense chief in 
the new coalition government in june seeing him as an unnecessary 
holdover of communist influence 
a petition signed by prominent student leaders was circulated 
in prague in recent weeks it demanded vaceks resignation and that 
of calfa also a former communist party member 
ctk quoted the petition as saying there is no way to ignore 
the halfhearted nature of events over the last 10 months we 
demand that all state bodies be cleansed of those who lack the 
moral and professional qualities needed for executing their 
functions 
finance minister vaclav klaus meanwhile urged cooperation from 
trade unions on his sweeping economic reforms which begin on jan 
1 ctk reported 
klaus who plans a radical freemarket reform of the ailing 
economy warned workers and business against pursuing private 
interests at the cost of the general welfare of the community the 
agency said 
czechoslovkias economy one of europes most developed between 
the wars has been devastated by four decades of communist central 
planning

an mci official wednesday denied that his 
company was deceiving consumers into switching their longdistance 
service from atampt saying atampt was exaggerating consumer 
complaints 
at a house hearing that featured continual verbal sniping 
between representatives of the two bitter rivals mci 
communications corp executive vice president eugene eidenberg said 
mci wouldnt risk its integrity for the sake of a few fraudulently 
gained customers 
eidenberg shrugged off claims by atampt that 90000 of its 
customers had been switched to another longdistance service 
against their will in the past six months 
much more common than the intentional switching by an 
interexchange longdistance carrier is a simple honest 
mistake eidenberg told the house government operation 
subcommittee on government information justice and agriculture 
but merrill tutton atampt vice president of consumer services 
cited an 86yearold connecticut woman who was asked to switch to 
mci even though she said she told the telemarketing caller that 
her daughter handled her affairs she was switched anyway without 
her approval tutton said 
time and time again consumers are being switched without their 
authorization or consent tutton said 
state and federal authorities and local phone companies have 
received tens thousands of complaints about unauthorized switching 
particularly in the wake of recent advertising wars between mci 
atampt and us sprint 
but eidenberg said one family member may agree to a switch 
without the knowledge of another or clerical errors may occur at 
local phone companies that process huge volumes of new phone orders 
and service changes each month customers sometimes switch and then 
change their minds 
eidenberg said atampt was grossly exaggerating the problem in 
which telephone marketing services call customers and ask them to 
authorize switching longdistance companies he said unauthorized 
switching was a very small percentage of legitimate service 
changes 
do not be taken in by atampts selfinterest in preserving its 
market share eidenberg told the subcommittee 
but rep bob wise dwva said the number of complaints 
probably was just the tip of the iceberg and that the problem 
known as slamming wont go away until state and federal 
regulators act 
federal rules now require only that the new longdistance 
companies be able to present on demand from a local phone company 
written authorization from a customer seeking a changeover if a 
customer complains and a written notice cannot be produced the 
company must pay to have the customer switched back to the original 
carrier 
but richard firestone the federal communications commissions 
chief telephone regulator testified that companies frequently 
switch customers back to the original carrier without even 
attempting to produce a written authorization 
atampt has asked the fcc to require written authorization in 
advance of any switch a rule the fcc had in 1985 until 
longdistance companies including atampt complained 
mci says customers wont switch if they have to sign something 
in advance and it is urging the fcc to establish standards and 
monitoring procedures for the telephone marketing companies and 
for easy return to the original carrier the national association 
of regulatory utility commissioners also said advance authorization 
would favor the incumbent

a former kgb official says he saw records 
indicating that raoul wallenberg the swedish diplomat who saved 
thousands of jews during world war ii was executed at least 33 
years ago the times of london said wednesday 
oleg gordievsky whose new book is being serialized in the 
times said he saw the wallenberg file in the archives of the 
soviet security agency 
soviet officials tried to recruit wallenberg shortly after the 
red army moved into budapest in 1945 gordievsky reportedly wrote 
in the book when wallenberg refused he was taken to the soviet 
union and shot not later than 1947 the times reported 
the times has been serializing gordievskys book kgb the 
inside story of its foreign operations from lenin to gorbachev 
which was coauthored by christopher andrew gordievskys account of 
wallenbergs death was not included in the excerpts but reported in 
a short news story in wednesdays editions 
soviet authorities said in 1957 that wallenberg died in 1947 in 
moscows lubyanka prison however wallenbergs relatives and other 
members of the wallenberg commission have pressed for 
investigations of reports that the diplomat was still alive 
he would be 77 today if still alive 
members of the commission including wallenbergs halfbrother 
guy von dardel went to helsinki finland last month in the hope 
of pressing president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to discuss the case at their summit meeting 
swedish authorities have relayed reports to soviet authorities 
that wallenberg was seen in the 1950s and 60s with less reliable 
reports of sightings continuing into the 1980s 
the commission said last month soviet authorities never looked 
into the prisons records although in 1957 the soviets said they 
had examined the records

many us high school students experience racism 
in their schools and communities and four of every 10 questioned 
for a survey released wednesday admitted they harbor racial or 
religious prejudices 
the survey shows that our children have learned how to hate 
said dr richard lapchick director of the center for the study of 
sport in society at northeastern university 
the national survey conducted by louis harris and associates 
found 57 percent of 1865 high school students questioned had 
witnessed or heard about a racial incident students in grades 10 
through 12 in public private and parochial schools responded to 
questionnaires between august 31 and september 18 
acts considered racially motivated included taunts graffiti and 
violent acts against people of a particular religion or race said 
louis harris chairman of the polling company 
the survey was conducted for reebok international ltd a 
stoughtonbased sports apparel 
this is something that is indigenous to most of the country 
harris said 
the survey found 61 percent of the students surveyed in the 
south had knowledge of a racial act compared with 58 percent in 
the west 50 percent in the midwest and 57 percent in the east 
the highest occurrences of racism occurred in suburban areas at 
60 percent while inner cities averaged 57 percent 
the study didnt provide statistics per city it had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 3 percent 
harris said 25 percent of the students reported having been the 
target of racial confrontations with violent overtones though not 
necessarily with actual violence blacks had the highest frequency 
at 70 percent followed by hispanics at 67 percent 
fortyseven percent said when confronted with a racial incident 
they would either join attackers or side against the group being 
attacked 
but one out of every two high school students say theyre 
prepared to do everything they possibly can do to stop such 
incidents from developing and to cut them off once they start 
harris said 
four in 10 students admitted harboring prejudices against other 
races or religious groups 
the high numbers indicate that this is a crisis by any measure 
indeed harris said its a crisis that cries out for some 
constructive programs to attempt to ease tensions and develop more 
tolerance and understanding among these young people themselves

president carlos menem signed a 
decree restricting strikes wednesday and three small bombs exploded 
in an apparent protest against his harsh economic reform program 
the decree which penalizes unions staging wildcat strikes and 
allows workers to be fired without severance pay under certain 
conditions came on the 45th anniversary of the foundation of the 
laborbased peronist movement 
menems opponents took the opportunity to note how far he had 
strayed from the populist peronist program that got him elected 
socialist national deputy simon lazara called the decree 
terrible 
legally its an abuse politically its an illegitimite act 
and the date which the decree is announced is an act of 
provocation he said 
the bombs caused no injuries and only minor damage to a citibank 
branch an office of the conservative union of the democratic 
center and a garbage truck that picked up a package at a 
government office 
police deactivated a bomb planted outside the office of perez 
compac a shipping and banking company no one claimed 
responsibility for the bombs 
citibank and perez companc are preparing to buy the state phone 
company as part of the governments privatization program the 
union representing the companys 47000 employees opposes the 
buyout fearing it will lead to layoffs and cutbacks in wages and 
benefits 
the union of the democratic center which finished third in the 
may 1989 voting that elected menem has strongly supported 
privatization in defiance of other peronist leader menem 
appointed several democratic center members to high office 
to balance the budget and bring down inflation that topped 1800 
percent the past 12 months menem has fired public employees 
severely restricted wages and put dozens of state companies up for 
sale 
many peronists say his policies have betrayed the legacy of 
party founder juan peron who created or nationalized many state 
companies during his 194655 presidencies 
on oct 17 1945 peron was freed from prison after hundreds of 
thousands of workers protested on his behalf the next year he was 
elected president 
workers right to strike is authorized in the constitution but 
menem decreed that essential services such as water 
electricity hospitals gas phones schools may not be shut down 
by strikes 
union leaders said the decree is unconstitutional 
the restriction of the right to strike and the economic 
program are like a person and its shadow because they support each 
other said legislator jesus rodriguez of the civic radical 
union argentinas second largest party 
saul ubaldini a strong opponent of menem was reelected 
wednesday to head a confederation of workers representing more than 
1 million teachers state workers and metalworkers 
ubaldini led the powerful 3 millionmember general labor 
confederation from 1980 until the federation split last october 
ubaldini led 13 general strikes against the 198389 government 
of menems predecessor raul alfonsin of the radical civic union 
menem claims to be unconcerned about the growing opposition to 
his administration 
ubaldini can stage one or 1000 strikes but the 
government wont change its path menem said before departing 
wednesday on a 10day trip to italy poland and the soviet union

british women who approach the iraqi embassy for 
news of their husbands trapped in iraq are being offered visas to 
travel there joanna copley a member of the gulf support group 
said wednesday 
she said she knew of two women who took up the offer of visas 
although they may not actually go to iraq 
some news reports said up to 15 british wives plan on going 
the foreign office said wednesday it advised british women not 
to go to iraq 
we believe this is simply a cynical propaganda ploy a 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity it is also 
very dangerous 
western men have been kept from leaving iraq and occupied kuwait 
since the aug 2 invasion but hundreds of women and children have 
been allowed to go home 
ms copley said the gulf support group set up to help families 
of those trapped in the persian gulf was also advising women not 
to go to iraq because they may not be allowed to leave again and 
also because the iraqis are bound to make propaganda out of it 
she said if wives took money into iraq they would be breaking 
united nations sanctions imposed to protest the invasion 
a man who answered the telephone at the iraqi embassy would not 
comment on the visa offer

a paraguayan opposition leader asked 
wednesday for the united nations to send pollwatchers to may 
municipal elections to verify that the country has entered the path 
toward genuine democracy 
paraguays un mission said the government has not yet decided 
if it wants independent election monitors from the united nations 
organization of american states or other agencies 
the may voting will be the first democratic mayoral election in 
the countrys history and could provide the opposition with the 
chance to strengthen its local organizations prior to the 1993 
national elections 
the paraguayan military overthrew gen alfredo stroessner in 
february 1989 and promised a return to democracy stroessner had 
ruled since 1956 
the vice president of paraguays chamber of deputies juan 
manuel benitez florentin met wednesday with one of the uns 
chief officials for central american affairs francesc vendrell to 
ask for the election observers 
benitez said vendrell told him the paraguayan government would 
have to make the request for observers and make it forcefully 
enough to persuade other nations to fund the request and send poll 
watchers 
benitez said he stressed that it is essential there be 
cleanness and transparency in the local elections or the 
public might become disenchanted with the political process 
our entire political structure is no different than it was 
under stroessner said benitez who is also president of the 
authentic radical liberal party a leading opposition party 
stroessner was ousted by his secondincommand gen andres 
rodriguez who won a presidential election held only three months 
later

successor in 1993 but many are skeptical that the powerful army 
and the official colorado party will relinquish power

a critical meeting of yugoslavias 
federal parliament was postponed wednesday and the defense minister 
denied a military coup was planned if the legislature remained 
split along ethnic lines 
the postponment of the session until friday following a full 
day of procedural wrangling was seen by most observers as a clear 
victory for the reformminded republics of croatia and slovenia 
the session was meeting to discuss whether yugoslavia would 
remain a federation which serbia advocates or a loose 
confederation which croatia and slovenia back 
the latest ethnic standoff had threatened to block the 
parliamentary session sparking a constitutional crisis and 
deepening the political chaos menacing the country 
the parliament also voted 125 to 40 wednesday to confirm stipe 
mesic as croatias new representative on the federal presidency 
serbian deputies earlier threatened to refused to seat mesic 
seen by many serbs as a croatian nationalist as croatias member 
in the eightmember presidency croatian deputies reacted by 
warning they would walk out of parliament 
the serbs were finally outvoted by a block of slovenian 
croatian bosnian and macedonian representatives 
rising tensions betwen serbs and croats before wednesdays 
session sparked widespread rumors the army might seize power if 
parliament couldnt agree on the future relationship of the six 
yugoslav republics 
defense minister veljko kadijevic described the rumors as 
nonsense 
they are nothing but vulgar provocations kadijevic told the 
associated press after wednesdays session 
the respected weekly danas in zagreb on monday quoted 
unidentified sources as saying a coup was one option that already 
had been discussed by top military officials 
the army is multiethnic but twothirds of all officers are 
serbs and more than 90 percent are or were members of the federal 
communist party 
vjesnik the main daily in the republic of croatia called the 
parliament session the last poker game in the lengthy power 
struggle over yugoslavias political future 
rising ethnic tensions already have resulted in clashes between 
croatian police and serbs in croatia 
a confederation plan advocated by croatia and slovenia where 
centerright parties have ousted communist governments in free 
elections is vehemently opposed by communistruled serbia 
borisav jovic the serb who currently holds yugoslavias 
rotating presidency is pushing a federal option that would keep 
power centralized in belgrade 
the presidency deadlocked over the issue last week and held 
stormy sessions monday and tuesday to try and forge a compromise 
janez drnovsek slovenias representative on the collective 
presidency walked out of the meeting tuesday to protest the stance 
of president borisav jovic a serb who holds the annually rotating 
chairmanship of the supreme body 
the state news agency tanjug on wednesday published what it said 
was a plan for the future from the presidency but the scheme 
seemed likely to draw support only from serbia and the tiny 
republic of montenegro 
according to tanjug the plan foresees a bicameral parliament 
with one chamber elected on the principle of one man one vote 
opponents say this would give serbs the largest ethnic group in 
yugoslavia with about 9 million people a dominant say in national 
affairs 
the plan also foresees yugoslavia remaining a federation and 
accords member states the right to decide the fate or existence of 
any provinces 
that would give serbia the right to abolish the province of 
kosovo an ancient serbian region now dominated by ethnic 
albanians

senate leaders wednesday night scrambled for 
support for a 250 billion deficitreduction plan that would double 
gasoline taxes cut medicare benefits and mildly boost income taxes 
on the wealthy 
the measure includes a broaderbased tax increase than the 
soaktherich house version that president bush has said he will 
veto 
democratic and republican leaders spent much of the day trying 
to line up enough votes to defeat what they called a killer 
amendment that would strip the gasoline tax boost from the measure 
the amendment by sen steve symms ridaho would cost nearly 43 
billion in revenues over five years 
were either going to come out of this exercise with a 500 
billion deficitreduction package or with nothing warned senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
as debate began democratic budget committee chairman james 
sasser dtenn said we tell the american people that there 
will be some sacrifice in this package but we tell them at the 
same time that it will be fair 
and the white house said the senate version could form the basis 
for ending the governments long budget stalemate 
the white house is ready to receive the bipartisan package 
similar to the senate package said bushs chief of staff john 
sununu get it to the presidents desk and hell sign it 
the administration also saiil now the president has tried to keep 
the pressure on by 
threatening to shut the government down unless congress sends him a 
full budget he can accept without emergency legislation federal 
authority to spend money expires at 1201 am saturday 
acting one day after the democrats pushed a bill much tougher on 
the rich through the house senate leaders chose to face election 
day just three weeks off with a proposal bearing all the marks of a 
political compromise 
there would be limits on deductions for people with incomes 
exceeding 100000 but no boost in tax rates for the rich as the 
house approved the 9centagallon gasoline tax would be doubled 
but the earnedincome tax credit for the poor would increase too 
the package would shave about 250 billion from the federal 
deficit over the next five years by raising 142 billion in new 
taxes and paring medicare farm support and other benefit programs 
savings in other bills mainly defense cuts would bring total 
deficitreduction to about 500 billion including 40 billion in 
the budget year that started oct 1 
bush had threatened to veto the house bill because of its 
increase in the upper bracket income tax rate though 
administration officials objected to some provisions in the senate 
version sununu said in an interview on nbctv the president liked 
the compromise 
despite the plans powerful supporters the senates democratic 
and republican leaders spent the day defending their plan from 
lawmakers unhappy for regional or philosophical reasons 
western senators complained that the higher gasoline tax would 
be a severe blow to states such as theirs where people routinely 
drive long distances others insisted that the bills overall tax 
package was unnecessary that spending should have been cut more 
deeply instead 
grab your wallets and run for cover because congress is 
getting up a head of steam to raise your taxes said symms 
party leaders replied that with the economy teetering everyone 
had to pull together 
i believe the deficit of the united states is so serious that 
it isnt a democratic issue or a republican issue or the 
presidents issue said sen pete domenici of new mexico the 
budget panels ranking republican the people want us to do 
something 
the starkest contrast between the senate and house bills was in 
how their pain would be distributed 
the senate measure would increase taxes on people earning more 
than 200000 by 37 percent exactly half the burden the house 
would impose those with incomes between 20000 and 50000 would 
see their tax bills jump by nearly 3 percent under the senate plan 
but only about 1 percent with the house version 
the senate omitted the income tax increase from 28 percent to 33 
percent that the house would impose on the wealthiest people it 
also excluded the moderate break in capital gains taxes that the 
house would grant to middleincome people 
like the housepassed bill the senate version would increase 
taxes on alcohol tobacco fancy cars private airplanes and boats 
furs and jewelry 
the senate bill would gradually hoist the monthly premium 
medicare recipients pay for doctors coverage from 2860 this year 
to 47 by 1995 80 cents higher than the house the senate would 
increase the annual deductible beneficiaries pay now 75 to 150 
next year compared to the houses 100 
the senate would also raise the wage cap from which the 145 
percent medicare tax is deducted from all paychecks from 51300 to 
89000 the house would push the cap to 100000 
both bills would also reduce medicare payments to doctors and 
hospitals the senates cuts totaling 34 billion and both would 
reduce support payments for farmers student loans and veterans 
benefits they would increase the 8 percent airline ticket tax by 
25 percent 
lawmakers would also raise fees for federal services ranging 
from emissions testing of cars to bank insurance

the caretaker government that succeeded 
ousted prime minister benazir bhutto filed two additional cases of 
corruption against her on wednesday one week before national 
parliamentary elections 
some legal experts expressed doubt that any of the six cases 
against her her husband and major members of her former government 
will be completed before the oct 24 voting special onejudge 
tribunals would hear the cases 
a hearing was set for oct 20 by justice mohammad amir malik to 
determine whether the 37yearold ms bhutto should stand trial 
there was concern in pakistan that the united states and other 
western countries would cut off millions of dollars in economic and 
military aid if ms bhutto is disqualified from running but us 
influence here has become an election issue and many fear she will 
be disqualified as a snub to washington 
president ghulam ishaq khan dismissed her 20monthold 
government on aug 6 as being so corrupt and incompetent it could 
not effectively govern this moslem nation of 110 million people 
ms bhutto is challenging his decision in court 
the new charges filed by the armybacked government accuse ms 
bhutto of using hundreds of millions of dollars in secret service 
funds to buy political favors and of using government and military 
aircraft to carry supporters in parliament during a noconfidence 
vote last year 
ms bhutto has denied any wrongdoing if found guilty one 
result could be her banishment from politics for seven years 
at least seven former bhutto cabinet ministers have been charged 
with corruption before tribunals and more than 100 supporters in 
her pakistan peoples party have been arrested 
ms bhuttos husband asif ali zardari 38 is also accused in 
the abduction of a pakistaniborn british man last april and is in 
prison 
his wife was allowed to visit him for two hours wednesday their

senate banking committee chairman donald 
riegle attended a closeddoor meeting wednesday of the senate 
ethics committee to discuss his relationship with indicted thrift 
owner charles h keating jr 
riegle dmich is one of five senators under scrutiny for 
their ties to keating and his lincoln savings and loan which 
government regulators seized last year the bailout expected to 
cost taxpayers at least 2 billion represents one of the costliest 
failures in us banking history 
the michigan senator spent more than four hours in the committee 
room and returned to the senate floor without seeing reporters 
he issued a written statement saying i welcomed the 
opportunity to meet directly with the ethics committee and review 
with them all the facts in this matter i know my conduct was 
proper and i will await the judgment of the committee 
the ethics committee chairman sen howell heflin dala 
declined to comment the vice chairman sen warren rudman rnh 
said only were through with the senators indicating the 
committee planned no more interviews of the five senators 
earlier committee member sen trent lott rmiss told 
reporters the panel should be ready to vote this week on whether to 
continue investigating some or all of the five 
in a statement issued later wednesday night the committee said 
it would begin a series of deliberative meetings on the matter 
thursday the committee said no statement would be issued until a 
decision has been made 
the ethics committee has met separately with each of the 
senators riegle is the last 
the threeterm democrat from flint has asserted repeatedly he 
did nothing wrong 
the public interest group common cause has accused riegle and 
the four other senators aan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz of improper 
behavior in interceding with federal regulators on keatings 
behalf 
keating and his associates contributed 13 million to the 
senators campaigns and causes the ethics committee is trying to 
determine whether the donations motivated the senators to help 
keating 
the senators say their actions were routine efforts to help a 
constituent settle a dispute with the bureaucracy 
keatings failed thrift was based in irvine calif and its 
parent company was in arizona but he had purchased and renovated 
the pontchartrain hotel in downtown detroit in a letter to the 
ethics committee on oct 18 1989 riegle said he had hoped keating 
would make further investments in the area 
keating hosted a fundraiser for riegles 1988 reelection 
campaign at the pontchartrain in march 1987 a year later riegle 
returned the 78250 he received from keating and associates 
saying he wanted to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest 
the five senators met with several california regulators who 
were investigating lincoln savings and loan on april 9 1987 
riegle did not attend a meeting a week earlier between the other 
four senators and edwin gray former head of the federal home loan 
bank board 
the ethics committee launched its investigation last december 
sources have said robert s bennett its outside counsel has 
recommended dropping glenn and mccain from the probe but the 
sources say bennett believes there is enough evidence to continue 
investigating riegle cranston and deconcini 
the recommendation on riegle apparently was based largely on the 
fact that his meeting with the regulators occurred less than three 
weeks after the detroit fundraiser sources have said 
riegles chief aide says the fundraiser was scheduled months 
before the april 9 meeting 
riegle has portrayed himself as having only minor involvement in 
the lincoln affair in his letter to the ethics committee he said 
he attended the meeting at the request of deconcini and mccain 
because of his knowledge of the banking industry 
at no time did i seek any meeting with regulators in lincolns 
behalf or suggest any course of regulatory action with respect to 
lincoln he said in a statement last october 
but riegle later acknowledged discussing the lincoln situation 
with gray in march 1987 gray has said that conversation led to the 
two meetings between senators and federal regulators that are a 
focal point of the controversy

cemetery outside sao paulo while searching sept 4 for the bodies 
of unidentified paupers who died in the early 1970s by law such

cemetery were those of indigents but at least 50 were the remains 
of political foes dumped there by security forces during brazils

rights violations after they left power in 1985 and the 
identifications will be used purely to help relatives confirm the 
deaths of missing people

and some of the benefit of our experience obtained in argentina 
where an equally tragic experience occurred said forensic 
anthropologist clyde snow of oklahoma city 
snowhas been working since 1984 with the argentine forensic 
anthropology team to identify the remains of suspected subversives 
who disappeared during the dirty war waged by argentinas

1985 identified the remains of nazi war criminal josef mengele in a 
cemetery near sao paulo 
snow was accompanied by luis fondebrider and alejandro 
inchaurregui of the argentine team

christian enclave of defeated gen michel aoun on wednesday and 
the government froze the rebel officers bank accounts 
witnesses said they saw a syrian armored brigade withdrawing 
from aouns former territory in the metn mountains northeast of 
beirut police said government and syrian troops also were leaving 
the christian heartland northeast of the capital 
the combat is over the forces that carried out the attack 
were ordered to start gathering at key road intersections and 
strategic locations said a police spokesman who could not be 
identified under standing rules 
the christian generals 11month mutiny against the government 
of president elias hrawi was crushed saturday by syrian and 
lebanese troops aoun took sanctuary in the french embassy and the 
newspaper annahar said it might take weeks or months for france 
and lebanon to reach agreement on his departure 
the lebanese central bank said it had carried out the 
governmentordered freeze on aouns local accounts and was 
arranging to block his access to deposits abroad 
banking sources quoted by the communistrun voice of the people 
radio station estimated the frozen assets at 100 million the 
figure could not be verified independently 
hrawis government has said it wants aoun tried on charges 
including the alleged theft of about 75 million from the state 
treasury 
the unidentified sources quotedbby the radio said some of the 
frozen funds were in the names of aouns two aides maj gen edgar 
maalouf and brig gen issam abujamra 
also wednesday hrawi sent his director of presidential affairs 
mahmoud othman and six presidential guards to assume control of 
the presidential palace in the christian suburb of baabda the 
55yearold aoun used the palace as his headquarters 
the presidential palace was damaged in fighting between aoun and 
syrian forces last year and in shelling duels with rival christian 
militia fighters of samir geagea this year 
repair work is expected to begin soon to enable hrawi to occupy 
the palace traditional seat of the presidency 
in aouns former enclave an 80squaremile area northeast of 
beirut that is home to 15000 maronites bakeries and groceries

the car will have to be ready by next week ill have to drive my 
children to school 
hrawi plans to form a reconciliation government to reunify the 
capital and implement a peace accord giving moslems and christians 
equal power in lebanon the accord is aimed at ending the 
15yearold civil war 
aoun rejected the peace accord largely because it did not set a 
timetable for withdrawing syrian forces 
syria the main powerbroker in lebanon has had troops in the 
country since 1976 the syrians are considered an army of 
occupation by many christians

federal authorities are struggling to estimate 
the size and reach of an elaborate credit card fraud scheme 
masterminded by a murder convict from his prison cell 
daniel neal faries has admitted he used a telephone and computer 
smuggled into his prison cell in florida to purchase hundreds of 
thousand of dollars worth of merchandise on other peoples credit 
cards 
later he even built his own phone within the federal prison in 
chicago to continue running the massive credit card fraud ring 
while he awaited charges of being a leader in the ring 
in newspaper interviews and statements quoted in court records 
faries claims he bribed two dozen prison guards with expensive 
gifts sent flowers and jewelry to his wife and even bought a se 
of diamondstudded false teeth for a fellow inmates mother 
he is scheduled for sentencing thursday in us district court 
in milwaukee he faces five years on the fraud charge and has asked 
the judge to give him the maximum so he can quickly return to 
prison and start a new scheme 
so far authorities have tracked down 500000 worth of 
merchandise stolen through his credit card scam but investigators 
said faries and a ring of up to 125 people could have illegally 
charged millions of dollars more in merchandise to other peoples 
credit cards 
the investigation could stretch on for years because of the 
widespread activities of the ring and the difficulty in proving 
that those who received gifts from faries knew about his scam said 
cliff deckard special agent in charge of the secret service in 
milwaukee 
nevertheless the investigator said he hopes to indict 50 people 
by next month the identities of suspects have not been released 
the case is being handled in milwaukee because some of the 
fradulently merchandise was purchased there 
faries has admitted he began using other peoples credit card 
information about four years ago while he awaited trial on a murder 
charge in a federal prison in miami 
faries was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison 
over the past four years faries has confessed to sending cases 
of wine limousine service gold coins food baskets and jewelry to 
friends and relatives while he was behind bars 
he also said he bought rolex watches and snakeskin boots for 24 
guards at the dade county jail in miami in exchange for access to a 
computer 
faries said a guard smuggled in a laptop computer and telephone 
in a laundry bag for him to obtain credit card information and make 
his illegal charges to other peoples accounts 
after faries was sentenced on may 1 to life in prison on the 
murder charge he was moved to chicagos metropolitan correctional 
center to await trial on the massive fraud scheme he operated while 
in the miami jail 
the switch to chicago however didnt stop him from running his 
credit card crime he said 
prison officials in illinois recently caught him with a 
rudimentary phone he built by tapping into the prison phone wires 
behind a metal plate in a jail room 
he dialed out of the prison to a satellite dish by using his 
electronic watch he said 
the tones of the watch similar to those of a telephone 
connected him with a worldwide satellite communication system 
faries said 
from there he said im away i can call anywhere in the 
world for free 
faries brags he is a smart thief who reads books and magazines 
while in jail to further his life of crime 
i get all the rags faries said in a weekend interview with 
the chicago sun times in miami i subscribed to everything up to 
and including working mother i liked the ads for mail order 
purchases in there 
secret service officials on the case say they hope faries 
sentencing on the creditrelated charge bars him from phone or 
computer use because hell already spend his life in prison on the 
murder charge 
im not sure what effect a jail sentence will have on him 
that has been the problem to begin with deckard said 
a sentencing in milwaukee should not have been necessary faries 
lawyer dean strang said 
if he did what they say he did it seems to me the most 
practical way to handle this problem would be to take away the 
telephone strang said 
prison officials in illinois and florida have refused to discuss 
faries case

rappaport as of sept 30 had loaned his campaign 225 
million or nearly 92 percent of the total he has spent this year 
were in the same ballpark with john kerry said rappaport 
spokesman gary mcmillan hes collected more than 5 million over 
the life of his senate term plus 2 million worth of free franked 
mail 
any financial advantages of incumbency were offset by 
rappaports ability to write his own campaign checks for millions 
said kerry consultant ron rosenblith 
the most recent polling conducted just after the sept 18 
primary showed rappaport trailing kerry by just 4 percentage 
points making the race statistically even 
the two candidates have aired television ads attacking their 
opponent rappaport issued a widely noted ad showing a photograph 
of the unpopular massachusetts gov michael s dukakis fading into 
a picture of kerry kerry immediately shot back with an ad raising 
questions about rappaports business dealings in vermont and 
hawaii

freeway which collapsed and killed 42 people 
standing with rescuers city officials and politicians many 
felt renewed pride as they recalled the efforts of neighbors who 
scaled the rubble of the doubledecked freeway to rescue trapped 
drivers 
a year ago today we heard the loudest noise ever heard in 
oakland said paul cobb head of the citizens emergency relief 
team a volunteer neighborhood group we saw neighbors grabbing 
ladders out of their basements those who stood on corners with 
nothing to do all of the sudden rose to the occasion

struck at 504 pm it killed 67 people 
people across the nation knew something was wrong when the 
television signal from the world series was lost the quake halted 
the third game of the series between the oakland athletics and the 
san francisco giants the as were again in the series in 
cincinnati and many spoke with quiet pride of the way 
californians helped the injured and rushed to rebuild 
those were some of californias most terrifying few seconds

the house voted wednesday night to normalize 
trade relations with czechsolovakia for the first time since world 
war ii and dramatically reduce tariffs on its exports to the united 
states 
by a voice vote the house approved a trade agreement signed 
last april by the bush administration and the newly elected prague 
government granting each other mostfavorednation trade status 
such a status qualifies the exporting country for the lowest 
tariffs in effect on the goods it ships to the buying country 
the agreement now goes to the senate where approval also is 
needed before barriers to trade with the formerly communist ruled 
czechs can come down 
although the agreement was signed in april president bush did 
not send the agreement to capitol hill for the required 
congressional approval until last month 
the accord will effectively reduce by 90 percent the tariffs 
paid on some 82 million in czech exports to the united states last 
year and open the way for increased business ties between the two 
countries 
the effect will be to give czechoslovakia a much broader us 
market for its exports by cutting their prices to wholesalers 
retailers and ultimately american consumers by as much as up to 40 
percent 
it also will open the czech economy to more us exports while 
also protecting american companies patents and copyrights 
the agreement is the first us bilateral trade accord with a 
former eastern bloc country since the warsaw pact began collapsing 
more than a year ago

five years ago ohio voters approved a 
bond issue to find ways to clean the states highsulfur coal and 
in the process save the jobs of miners like jerry back 
some 85 million later back is anything but reassured 
ive got 15 years here and id hate to see it go down the 
drain back said as he prepared for the start of the second shift 
at the meigs no 2 mine i think in five years we may be 
working but i dont think well be working after five years 
ohios highsulfur coal once burned in many of the regions 
electrical power plants fell into disfavor in the 1980s amid 
rising concern about acid rain pollution state officials seeing 
the market diminish asked voters in 1985 to approve a 100 million 
bond issue to back research projects aimed at finding a way to 
remove some of the sulfur 
while officials say the research is promising the solutions may 
not gain widespread commercial acceptance in time to save many ohio 
mines and the jobs of 6700 miners 
im a coal miner but im a person too said miner bill 
oiler if there is a problem out there we do need to find a 
solution but the solution is not to just do away with jobs we 
need to find technology to alleviate the problem 
ohio coal development office chief jacqueline bird said her 
office has disbursed about 85 percent of the money raised through 
the 1985 bond issue some of the projects will soon enter 
largescale testing while others remain on the drawing board 
if there were a quick easy solution god knows we would have 
done it by now ms bird said were trying to find the 
permanent solution if there were a shortterm answer we would 
have landed on it 
ohio coal is abundant the ocdo estimates a 200year reserve 
but it is loaded with sulfur which combines with oxygen during 
burning to form sulfur dioxide sulfur dioxide combines with 
hydrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid 
typical ohio coal has a sulfur content of about 35 percent 
most utilities need coal with sulfur content below 07 percent 
the federal government has steadily tightened sulfur dioxide and 
nitrogen oxide emission limits and even more stringent limits are 
pending in congress as the limits have shrunk so have ohio coal 
sales and mining jobs 
even ohios own utilities and mills burn more coal from out of 
state than instate mines last year less than 46 percent of the 
coal burned in ohio came from within the state us department of 
energy figures show 
but it takes as long as 25 years for a technology to move from 
concept to commercial acceptance ms bird said each stage must be 
tested and the next step revised on the basis of earlier findings 
and even when the technology is proven it takes time for the 
industry to trust it and invest millions of dollars in plant 
renovations she said 
ohio doesnt lack ideas at lorain it is testing a process that 
burns limestone along with coal to absorb sulfur dioxide 
at a plant in brilliant which was shut down in the 1970s because 
of the cost of complying with clean air laws theyre turning water 
to steam by burning a mix of coal and sorbent which reacts with 
and captures sulfur 
the steam drives a turbine and creates electricity but the 
gases from the burning are cleaned of sulfur and then used to 
create electricity in a second turbine remaining hot gas is used 
to heat fresh water headed into the boiler 
but jack segall us department of energy deputy assistant 
secretary for coal technology said there are no rewards for taking 
risks in new technology 
if the cost of producing electricity as a result of this new 
technology goes down its the ratepayer who gets the benefit he 
said if the technology does not work its the utility that gets 
penalized 
president bushs clean air plan includes incentives to encourage 
use of clean coal technologies segall said but its still not 
clear what choice utilities will make he said 
and in the meantime we hold our breath and hope we can make 
it ms bird said 
in ohio if the clean air act amendments dont change 
substantially from where they are now the large mining companies 
will be able to make it and so will some of the mediumsized 
companies she said youll probably see more mergers between 
medium and smallsized companies and some companies will go 
under unfortunately 
the best hope is to accelerate the pace of clean coal technology 
development ms bird said 
the problem now is people are saying well youve been in 
existence in five years why isnt it solved its the perception 
that if you throw enough money at it quickly thatll do it ms 
bird said 
but you cant push science and technology along that fast you 
can accelerate it but you cant make it meet false deadlines

john wayne rode into americas heart as a 
whitehatted tamer of the west but some historians say if the 
truth had found its way into those old westerns wayne would have 
worn a black hat 
theres really kind of an insult to indian people in that 
notion of white person stands at mississippi river and looks into 
the horizon and says its open its free its mine said 
university of colorado history professor patricia limerick 
certainly historically people did that but i dont see any 
reason why the historians should echo the point of view of one of 
the participants to have your vanity your selfimage or your 
pride rest on an untruth is not good for individual mental health 
national mental health 
limerick 39 is a new west historian a breed of western 
historians who see the pioneers as exploitive conquerors who 
damaged the environment with their unrestrained hunting trapping 
and mining 
the ranks of the new west historians include limerick howard 
lamar of yale donald worster of the university of kansas and 
others they say traditional western history omitted the tragedies 
and the contributions made by indians hispanics french trappers 
chinese blacks and women 
when the dust settled the invaders had more power and the 
natives had less said limerick whose book the legacy of 
conquest the unbroken past of the american west is written from 
the new west viewpoint 
not everyone agrees with the revisionists ab guthrie author 
of the big sky and university of wisconsin history professor 
alan bogue believe the they tend to overemphasize the negative side 
of the wests settlement 
life is hard everywhere inequalities are forever guthrie 
wrote recently in nieman reports the revisionists wideeyed 
discovery of them in the west strikes me as a bit naive it is the 
blind cruelties of life on this planet that have led man to invent 
heaven 
most americans learned about the settlement of the west from the 
writings of frederick jackson turner a univesity of wisconsin 
history professor who influenced historians for more than a 
century 
in the late 1800s turner made the angloamerican settler the 
focus of his account of the wests settlement these settlers were 
depicted as having given up comfortable homes to start new lives in 
an unforgiving wilderness free to anyone brave enough to tame it 
turner also is credited with formulating the frontier 
thesis which said the frontier that set americans apart from the 
rest of the world closed in 1890 us census data was cited 
his premise laid the groundwork for the belief in a uniquely 
american pioneer spirit that authors and presidents have invoked to 
inspire a nation limerick said a recent poll of teachers of 
western history showed 87 percent used turners theses as the basis 
for their courses 
turner and his students and his generation tended to see the 
western experience as something that was extremely impressive 
people marched across the continent and turned it into homes and 
industries in a relatively short time said bogue 
there were always underlying stories that were something we 
couldnt be nearly as proud of perhaps turners version of the 
west was what he and his generation saw in it 
the new west historians believe western history should be 
written as a continuous story not with a division between the 19th 
and 20th centuries 
without such an arbitrary dividing line the california gold 
rush of 1848 for example could be tied into 20th century mining 
booms in which the same land water and environmental issues 
recurred 
because the two centuries usually are treated as two separate 
eras textbooks that may address california economics and 
demographics usually fail to show how they relate to the states 
history said clyde a milner ii a utah state university professor 
who is editor of the western historical quarterly 
new west history is a developing trend over the past 30 years 
that now is reaching a critical mass milner said 
critics argue that new west historians find too much fault in 
turners work which was wellaccepted at the time 
they are overemphasizing the unfortunate results of the 
western movement it gave millions of people the opportunity to 
provide for new lives said bogue 
one i dont think can be criticized too harshly for saying 
hey look it really does look as if an era is ending people of 
that time thought so 
limerick blamed the stagnation of us historical theory during 
the postturner era on historians trapped by his definitions of the 
frontier they drove themselves into a culdesac and then became 
stymied she said 
as the historians debate the new ideas are gaining acceptance 
in a wide arena with a growing emphasis on specialized history 
whose focus ranges from the environment to cultural diversity 
in addition the more realistic views are gaining a foothold in 
literature from the popular southwestern indian mystery novels of 
author tony hillerman to a 12 million abctv miniseries about 
george armstrong custer based on author evan s connells son of 
the morning star 
but the new west historians face an uphill journey to conquer 
all the myths as witnessed by the popularity of larry mcmurtrys 
novel lonesome dove and the subsequent tv miniseries she 
said 
there is a place for the romantic tales of the old west that 
made john wayne famous as long as we let it have as much power 
as we think it should have we ought to be aware of where the 
movie screen is and where we are

contributions 
scores of other voluntary agencies also are opposing the move 
monsignor robert n lynch general secretary of the national 
conference of catholic bishops said weakening the incentives 
for contributions would not only be counterproductive but 
contradict the repeated calls by president bush for increased 
involvement by the nonprofit private sector in addressing needs of 
the less fortunate in our society 
kay s dowhower director of the governmental affairs office for 
the evangelical lutheran church in america noted individuals 
contributed 96 billion in 1989 to various causes serving public

mimi rogers sees a gleam of hope that women 
may one day achieve equal status in todays macho movie world 
its an unfortunate fact that there are many more roles for 
men than there are for women a favorable sign is the success of 
films like pretty woman and ghosts much more successful than 
big maledominated action films she said 
with these two films in which women are on more of an equal 
level being so successful maybe the trend will start to shift in 
the direction of having men and women really costarring 
upcoming movies seem promising cher and winona ryder costar in 
orions mermaids a sweet relationship movie michelle pfeifer 
costars with sean connery in the russia house based on the 
john le carre thriller julia roberts stars in next springs 
sleeping with the enemy and academy awardwinner jody foster 
is eagerly awaited as the star of silence of the lambs a taut 
thriller based on the best seller by thomas harris 
if not equal rogers has a vital role in desperate hours 
with mickey rourke and anthony hopkins its dino de laurentiis 
update of the 1955 movie with rogers in the part originated by 
martha scott rourke plays the humphrey bogart role of a criminal 
psycho who takes a suburban family hostage hopkins has the part of 
the husband originally played by fredric march 
the director of the mgm release is michael cimino yes the same 
michael cimino who won an academy award for the deer hunter in 
1978 and made the financial bomb heavens gate in 1980 
rogers remarked that during the desperate hours filming 
cimino was very relaxed very much at ease and enjoying the whole 
process there was an awareness on his part that he wanted to bring 
it in on time and on budget i think we actually finished a week 
early and under budget 
he knows that he knows how to make movies theres no question 
the guy has made some brilliant movies its more a matter of 
reaffirming that he can do it that he can follow a schedule and a 
budget that its no problem and boom theres the movie thats 
what he did 
rogers has three new films desperate hours the doors 
oliver stones biography of rocker jim morrison and the 
rapture an apocalyptic drama last january she and tom cruise 
ended their threeyear marriage during which she seemed to be 
subordinating her own career as his zoomed skyward 
she corrected that impression i actually worked quite a bit 
unfortunately two of the films that i did havent been released in 
this country 
i did a picture for vestron called hider in the house with 
gary busey that got caught up in the companys bankruptcy then i 
did a film with james belushi called to forget palermo we spent 
14 weeks shooting that it was an italianfinanced film an 
english language film with an italian director thats always a 
bit of an experiment she said 
i dont know what happened to it maybe american distributors 
looked at it and thought it wasnt going to make money both of 
those films i think have been released internationally but not 
here so theres an apparent void that didnt really exist 
like her former husband mimi short for miriam rogers had a 
traveling childhood both their fathers were engineers who took 
jobs all over rogers was born in coral gables fla but she moved 
to virginia arizona michigan england and finally los angeles a 
good student she graduated from high school at 14 and started 
acting in her 20s her first film was blue skies again with 
harry hamlin 
her other costars include michael keaton gung ho 
christopher reeve street smart tom berenger some to watch 
over me and denzel washington the mighty quinn 
she usually plays the love interest but she hopes that will 
change as movies take a feminine tilt

for three of the danish film extras 
playing jewish refugees waiting to be shipped to safety in sweden 
the scene gave them an eerie feeling of deja vu 
oskar kaznelson and his wife bella and hans goldstein were 
among 7200 jews smuggled out of germanoccupied denmark in small 
boats to neutral sweden under the noses of the gestapo during the 
autumn of 1943 another 464 members of the community were not so 
fortunate they ended up in a german concentration camp 
fortyseven years after their dramatic night escape the 
kaznelsons and goldstein once again were being bundled into fishing 
boats standing by to make the risky 10mile dash across the 
oeresund strait to the swedish coast 
but this time they were only playing a scene in a movie and the 
gunwielding youths hustling them below decks were actors playing 
danish resistance fighters 
a day in october began filming at the end of september and 
is to be finished in november the script was largely inspired by 
leo goldbergers book the rescue of the danish jews moral 
courage under stress and is being done in english 
for the kaznelsons their roles brought back memories of their 
own flight from denmark in september 1943 when they were smuggled 
out of copenhagen 
oskar and bella kaznelson were engaged to be married when on 
august 2829 1943 there was growing civil unrest in copenhagen and 
the germans took over the couple fled denmark on sept 12 paying 
the equivalent of about 1000 each to be smuggled to the swedish 
port of malmoe 
when we got to the swedish side the first thing that happened 
was that we were thrown in jail said the 71yearold kaznelson 
it wasnt until oct 1 1943 that sweden began accepting jewish 
refugees from abroad 
after they became legitimate refugees oskar joined the danish 
brigade a group of refugee danish military officers policemen and 
resistence fighters bella went to her parents in gothenburg they 
returned to denmark on liberation day may 1 1945 bella is now a 
dental assistant and oskar is sells equipment for the building 
industry 
goldstein now a public accountant came to denmark from vienna 
in 1938 his mother died in auschwitz his father survived one of 
the camps and went to the united states goldstein escaped to 
sweden by boat spent two weeks in a refugee camp there and 
returned in june 1945 he had intended to go to palestine but was 
prevented at the time because of the political situation in the 
area so he married a danish woman and settled down in this 
country 
the movie is basically the story of a young danish resistance 
fighter who falls in love with a jewish girl who is being pursued 
by the gestapo said damian slattery the american screenwriter 
the fictional plot is set against the authentic historical 
backdrop of occupied denmark he said 
goldbergers book contains contributions by american and danish 
historians and witnesses of the events in denmark in 1943 he is 
the danishborn son of the former cantor of the main synagogue in 
copenhagen and escaped with his family during the october boat 
lift 
the danes made a fantastic effort they stood together they 
were deeply offended by the deportations and they were able t say 
what they thought about the germans goldberger said 
db sweeney gardens of stone eight men out plays the 
danish underground leader and actress kelly wolf portrays sara 
kublitz the hunted girl wolf costarred in triumph of the 
spirit about the plight of jews in wartorn europe daniel 
benzali and tovah feldshuh play her parents 
the movie is directed by kenneth madsen a dane who has won a 
clio award for his commercials and is making his feature film 
debut it is produced by just betzer who made the academy 
awardwinning babettes feast and french videomaker philippe 
rivier

as political punishment the drive to limit 
lawmakers terms and tenure can send them a message without getting 
personal and even disenchanted voters seem to prefer it that way 
the upstart issue of this campaign term limits are gaining 
endorsements from some candidates who see them as hostile to the 
establishment and to incumbents few of whom are likely to be 
ousted by the voters 
term limits offer a way out for voters who tend to favor their 
own representatives while complaining about what is happening at 
the state house or the capitol 
people say i like my legislator but not the legislature 
said john keast who tracks referendum issues for the conservative 
free congress foundation term limits are a concept rather than a 
candidate its much easier for people to handle 
a washington postabc news poll conducted oct 14 makes the 
point in numbers 63 percent of those surveyed said they 
disapproved of the way congress is doing its job and 64 percent 
said they approved the performance of their own house member 
despite the voter dissatisfaction reflected in polls neither 
party expects major changes in congress in the nov 6 elections 
only two states california and colorado will be deciding in 
this election whether to restrict terms in office oklahoma already 
has imposed a 12year limit for state legislators effective jan 
1 that measure was approved by twothirds of the voters in a sept 
18 primary election polls reflect majority support for the other 
two state measures but there is an intensive wellfinanced 
campaign against the california limits 
it would take a broadened movement with staying power to apply 
term limits in a way that would force real changes from a system in 
which incumbency and the seniority that comes with it usually 
rule 
vice president dan quayle sees that coming the voters are 
channeling their discontent into real and lasting reform said 
quayle who is pushing term limits as he campaigns for republican 
candidates 
the people are restless quayle said this new wave of 
cynicism has been building for a long time it should not be 
discounted clearly term limitation is an idea whose time has 
come 
president bush says hes for term limits noting that the 
republican platform advocates them while bush hasnt stressed it 
as an issue gop gubernatorial candidates have in states like 
texas florida california and georgia 
for example as he campaigned with bush in dallas on monday 
clayton williams said that if he is elected governor he will push 
a constitutional amendment for term limits the people in texas 
are fed up with the politicians in austin williams said 
opponents of term limits argue that career bureaucrats and 
special interests would become stronger than they already are if 
legislatures were stripped of their veteran lawmakers 
they complain that term limits are an antidemocratic measure 
because they restrict the choices available to the voters 
advocates concede that point but say its a price worth paying for 
change 
while there is some democratic support for term limit measures 
it makes more sense for republicans the gop would benefit from 
turnover especially in the house which has been run by democratic 
majorities for 36 years 
a constitutional amendment proposed in the senate early this 
year would impose a 12year ceiling on senators and house members 
but it is not going anywhere in congress so supporters are trying 
to build pressure in the states resolutions advocating 
congressional term limits have been proposed in at least 29 state 
legislatures adopted in only two 
colorados state measure also would impose a 12year limit on 
service in congress a provision that certainly would face 
constitutional challenge in the courts 
but measures that apply only to state legislatures could 
eventually turn up the pressure for action to limit congressional 
tenure too 
people rightfully feel that entrenched legislators are only 
interested in getting reelected and i do not think the movement 
to limit terms will stop at the state level quayle said in 
louisville ky last week 
he said it should be extended to cover the house and senate 
where he served 12 years his first speech as a congressman from 
indiana in 1977 was a call for federal term limits it had been one 
of his campaign themes in 1976 when he upset a veteran democrat

for the associated press has reported on washington and national 
politics for more than 25 years

when dale randolphs organization decided nine years ago to 
translate the bible into modern russian he had no idea how it 
could be useful to the russian people since their country then 
barred importing bibles 
but that project of uncertain ends has turned out to meet a 
surprising and newly expanding purpose 
when we started i didnt have the slightest idea what we 
could do he said in those days it was illegal even to walk 
around the streets of moscow with a bible 
despite the uncertainty the translation work went ahead simply 
in faith without any known feasible usefulness he said 
but by the time the sevenyear job was finished in 1988 he 
said the doors had swung wide open to an immense pentup 
russian yen for bibles a yearning now being served by randolphs 
group and other american organizations 
like others i didnt have any idea the situation was going to 
change he said in an interview the only explanation is that 
someone other than us was watching over this our ministry has been 
blessed over and over in incredible ways 
randolph president of the world bible translation center in 
fort worth texas said a printing of 100000 of its new testaments 
was scheduled for completion in moscow on saturday and would be 
sold through soviet bookstores 
printing of an additional 300000 copies was contracted with a 
grand rapids mich plant as the first part of a goal of 1 million 
copies to be given free to russians by years end plans call for 
handing out a million complete bibles next year 
they will be distributed partly through a branch bible 
center opened in moscow this fall as part of the kuntsevo 
cultural center 
the demand for bibles is just incredible said randolph who 
has made five trips to the soviet union this year arranging the 
project when freedom came it was like a dam had been broken 
and the desire came gushing forth 
the people have been totally starved for the bible theyve 
been starved for information about god everyone in that country is 
wanting to know what christianity is about from government on 
down 
they want to look at what it says about family life about 
alcoholism and other problems to see its answers to life there is 
a tremendous hunger for it the opportunities over there are just 
benumbing 
other agencies also are swelling the flow of bibles to the 
soviet union including the american bible society in which most 
denominations participate and the evangelical publishers 
association in a special moscow project 
those bibles however are in the 17th century russian 
synodal translation as traditionally used by the russian 
orthodox church and other russianlanguage churches 
were the only group providing a modern russian translation 
randolph said were shooting at the masses its not so 
necessary to reach church people as to reach the man in the 
street 
randolphs organization which also produces modern translations 
in other major languages and a simpleenglish version for the deaf 
said two key principles are followed that the rendering be true 
to the original hebrew and greek and be easily understood in the 
target language 
started in 1972 the center is associated with the churches of 
christ for which randolph formerly was a missionary in greece the 
staff of about a dozen includes three scholars in greek and hebrew 
who oversee adherence of the modernlanguage translations to the 
original meanings 
shortly after the center completed its russian new testament 
randolph got a firsthand sampling of the russian appetite for 
bibles at a moscow book fair in september 1989 
his booths supply of 10000 copies was exhausted in one 
morning and for the next day and a half names and addresses were 
taken of 17000 other muscovites wanting bibles these later were 
sent 
the center since has completed the entire bible in modern 
russian 
randolph said much of the change in the soviet union has its 
roots in religious desires in a hungering of citizens in that 
country and most of eastern europe to know more about god 
everthing points to a surge forward of christianity in that 
country he said 
he said that with the soviet union moving toward capitalism the 
people may seek to find their answers to life in western 
materialism but there also is a powerful religious base despite 70 
years of communist efforts to eradicate it he said 
the russian orthodox church is at a high point of its 
existence he said adding the soviet union very well may 
provide a major thrust to christianity in the years ahead

look out here comes the boat no the 1991 chevrolet caprice 
look at how it floats across those bumps in the road look how 
those six adults pile in easily on the cloth bench seats front and 
rear look at how the golf clubs the suitcases the carts full of 
groceries all disappear into the massive trunk 
its like looking at a part of americana there just arent many 
big autos like this left 
big chevrolets have been part of the general motors corp fleet 
for decades since the 1950s sales of the middleamerica 
breadandbutter cars have totaled more than 38 million 
for 1991 gm has redesigned its caprice and looks for sales of 
about 200000 units compared with 150087 in 1989 already this 
calendar year the new caprice which debuted in april is helping 
boost sales more than 8 percent above last years pace 
the design and engineering changes include a 5liter v8 engine 
as standard teamed with a fourspeed automatic transmission the 
package delivers 170 horsepower and provides for a maximum 5000 
pounds of towing capacity up 1000 from the 1990 caprice the 
previous models 43liter v6 engine has been dropped 
the v8 performed well in the test drive though i could feel 
the shift points during demanding acceleration chevrolet reports 
the caprice can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 105 seconds a 
respectable showing for a car this size so was fuel economy at 17 
miles per gallon city 26 on the highway 
gm also boosted safety features in the redesign installing a 
driverside air bag and fourwheel antilock brakes as standard 
equipment 
suspension provided by fourwheel coil springs was on the mushy 
side during the test drive giving a floating feeling as the car 
hit potholes and bumps on the streets 
outside the caprice is rounded both front and rear the rear 
wheel fenders are skirted adding to the sloping aerodynamic look 
the styling helps take the edge off the largeness of the car but 
once youre inside and driving youre reminded that its a big 
automobile i nearly backed into another vehicle the first time in 
reverse being unused to having so much car back there 
inside theres ample room for six adults chevrolet added 3 
more inches of shoulder room and 2 more inches of hip room because 
the car retains its reardrive configuration the middle person in 
back must contend with the midfloor hump 
but even with the front seat all the way back and reclined a 
bit i could stretch out my legs the rear shelf below the back 
window also was one of the largest ive seen 
the trunk with 204 cubic feet of cargo space is so monstrous 
that a small person might have to climb inside to reach the spare 
tire chevrolet wisely designed the lid so that items do not have 
to be lifed up and over the body just over the bumper 
exterior fit and finish was good though on the test car some of 
the trunk lining was not attached on one side 
caprice buyers typically have a fond place in their hearts for 
a fullsize chevy said company spokesman david hudgens 
target buyers for the 1991 model will be younger than previous 
buyers who averaged about 62 years of age hudgens said many past 
buyers have been retirees and they used their caprices for social 
and recreational trips 
theyre in their middle years and they have time to travel 
hudgens said they want comfort and space 
today the company hopes to get more buyers who are in their 40s 
and 50s who will use the car for commuting to work too 
base price for the test car was 16515 competitors include the 
ford crown victoria which starts at more than 16600 and the 
chrysler new yorker which starts at more than 19000 
consumer reports magazine lists 198385 caprice models as 
average in owner reports of trouble the 1986 model was ranked 
worse than average and the 198788 models were listed as much worse 
than average 
hudgens said chevrolet is always trying to improve quality and 
that production plants are working to get reliability and 
durability to a worldclass level

the street kids of lima are called 
piranhas for the amazon fish that can strip a swimmer of flesh 
in minutes they swarm over victims in packs snatching wallets 
purses and jewelry 
freddy lives in university park downtown lima his clothes are 
torn and dirty he has a long deep red cut on his right ear but 
no open sores on his face like some of the others 
he is 11 years old like the other kids freddy sniffs glue to 
get high or quiet his hunger 
hundreds of children roam the garbagefilled streets of lima 
willing even to sell their bodies for enough to buy some food and 
glue without help most probably will die soon or end up in perus 
infamous prisons 
many of the kids have venereal disease some have aids and all 
of them have some kind of skin infection said dwight ordonez 
head of a project called ninos de la calle street kids that is 
trying to help 
peru is in its worst economic crisis and thousands of children 
hustle a living on the streets of lima a city of 7 million 
children of 5 or 6 hawk cigarettes shine shoes or wash cars 
most go home at night even if home is only a shack 
for the hundreds of piranhas there is no home they live in 
parks plazas on the river bank behind the government palace 
packs of them roam la parada a huge food market frequented by 
drug dealers and prostitutes and kennedy park in miraflores a 
district of nightclubs and luxury shops 
the city operates five youth shelters there are several 
orphanages and the police have two juvenile detention centers but 
the number of children on the street indicates the old system 
doesnt work 
ninos de la calle is part of the private usfinanced center 
of information and education for the prevention of drug abuse it 
takes a different approach because we are convinced the normal 
way of working with street kids fails said ordonez 30 who has 
a masters degree in psychology 
he said the traditional way is to confine the children beat 
them and impose overly strict rules 
ordonez said ninos de la calle homes are like ponds next to a 
river where the piranhas can swim in stay awhile and swim out 
house rules are fairly simple no stealing fighting breaking 
things drugs or sex 
ninos de la calle has two homes and is building a third about 
55 boys have continuing contact with the group 
the project was born in june 1989 ordonez and other team 
members spent three months in the streets studying homeless 
children and were horrified by what they saw 
limas street kids all boys and aged 10 to 16 run in 
looseknit gangs of 30 to 50 ordonez said all sniff glue he 
said and about 10 percent smoke pasta basica semiprocessed 
coca leaf from perus amazon jungle 
project workers won the confidence of the boys who generally 
are aggressive and antisocial by organizing soccer games 
once exposed to the homes set up by ninos de la calle many 
decided to stay they even chased away other piranhas who tried to 
lure them back onto the street with promises of drugs 
the homes biggest attraction seems to be a sense of belonging 
to a group where someone cares 
ordonez said most of the boys were from poor families but 
divorce and abuse drove more of them into the streets than poverty 
what they need more than anything else is to talk but its 
what they do least said eduardo villanueva 29 a psychologist 
who has been with the project since it began 
one of villanuevas boys at miraflores house is carlos a lanky 
16yearold with a shy smile when they first met villanueva said 
carlos was always high on glue and had trouble speaking 
when i was sick they helped me carlos said of ninos de la 
calle when i wanted to leave they invited me to stay 
after two months at miraflores carlos has begun attending a 
nearby public school where he is about five years behind other 
boys of his age he said he wants to learn accounting and work in a 
bank

daniel ortega who won international 
respect by accepting an election defeat says revolution in latin 
america may survive the collapse of european communism but not if 
its leaders cling to dogma 
nicaraguas former president said in an interview that injustice 
and poverty still are problems in the region providing the fodder 
of revolution 
at 46 with a decade of leadership behind him as head of the 
sandinista national liberation front ortega has abandoned the 
olive fatigues and blackandred bandanna of his guerrilla days and 
years in power president bush once compared the outfit to a boy 
scout uniform 
ortega cultivates a youthful image dressing in jeans and 
colorful shirts and remains politically active in nicaragua and 
abroad young admirers pursue him for autographs when he appears in 
public 
his acceptance of the february election loss to violeta 
chamorro nicaraguas new president improved his image in the 
world at home ortega has reined in the more radical elements of 
the sandinista national liberation front 
a combination of ortegas influence and two crippling strikes 
led by the sandinistas persuaded the new government to retain many 
sandinista programs including land distribution 
the reality of nicaragua is that no one can govern without the 
fsln he said using the initials of the sandinista front 
i am sure that our talks with the government and our attempts 
to reach a consensus have angered some people inside the 
government but we think common sense is prevailing 
elements of mrs chamorros fractious coalition accuse her of 
weakness for dealing with the sandinistas who are by far the 
largest party in nicaragua and want to be consulted on important 
economic decisions 
the sandinistas oppose such austerity measures as currency 
devaluations reductions in the public payroll and selling 
nationalized industries back to private investors 
ortega works for the party and travels abroad seeking foreign 
aid for nicaragua 
he said being out of office allows him more time with his eight 
children but that they interfere with a book he is writing on the 
years in government 
wealthy nations are focusing on their own concerns at the 
expense of latin america and other poor regions ortega said 
we will now see an industrialized north including the former 
socialist countries that will determine the dstribution of the 
worlds technological resources he predicted the problems of 
the third world will continue the industrialized countries of the 
north have no time to consider our economies or problems in the 
south 
us economic assistance to mrs chamorros government has not 
met nicaraguan expectations about 65 million in cash has been 
provided since april and an additional 40 million is promised in 
credits for agricultural development 
the collapse of the eastern socialist bloc gives the united 
states the hegemonic control that always was its objective in latin 
america ortega said the policies of assistance of the 
socialist bloc disappear and they are not compensated by the 
united states or other industrialized countries 
this places latin america at a disadvantage it does not help 
our countries the need for revolutionary change remains 
we still have a revolutionary movement in el salvador and 
brazil can explode too we have armed groups in peru and colombia 
what happened in the east does not improve the living conditions of 
people in the south 
washington no longer can accuse all revolutionary movements of 
being communist ortega added and at the same time the 
revolutionary movement must rethink the kind of projects and 
programs they want in the past there was a tendency to 
dogmatism 
our revolution was never subordinated to the soviet union 
he said they offered their support after the victory 
the united states must show respect for latin america if it 
wants a world of peace and latin america must increase its 
contacts with sectors of influence in the united states that 
know the rich will sink if the needs of the poor are not 
satisfied ortega said 
of nicaraguas future and the sandinista role in it he said 
we realize this government came to power with the help of the 
united states we accepted the challenge in the elections 
but the nicaraguan revolutions changes brought on by the 
sandinista front remain 
now the party must change and adapt to the times neither the 
structure nor the programs of a party are immovable we now need 
other forms although the objectives of ending human exploitation 
and the principles of justice remain 
we still have a lot to do to emerge from the crisis he 
said

the television networks race to announce who 
won on election night is over and the winner is vrs 
vrs 
this year for the first time abc cbs nbc and cnn have put 
together a single organization voter research and surveys or vrs 
for exit polls and projections this means two things the 
networks will save money and the main competitive aspect in tv 
election coverage is gone 
of course its being changed no question said warren 
mitofsky executive director of vrs but now i think the networks 
have an opportunity to compete on a much better playing field 
instead of competing about who can come up with numbers first 
they can compete on their news coverage they have a good chance to 
do their analysis their interpretation of what it means and a 
good presentation 
vrs will cost each member 3 million through the 1992 fall 
elections said mitofsky the networks wont say how much theyre 
saving with vrs but they use the word substantial most often 
in their descriptions 
in this age nobody wants to lose a lot of money on news and 
elections never paid their way said mitofsky who led cbss 
election unit for 20 years the commercial revenue from election 
night maybe paid less than a third of the cost this was a very 
expensive proposition without much return 
for 3 million each network gets exit polls and projections for 
all senate house and governors races and they get the same 
information on a selected few state and local races of national 
interest like the washington mayors race and californias 
propositions 
the numbers will be the same but how we interpret that 
information how we use it will be different said mary klett 
nbcs director of elections and polling 
vrs has about 55 people working on the 1990 elections with a 
permanent staff of about half that mitofsky said vrs absorbed 
many of its people from cbs election unit and layoffs from other 
network election units 
in hindsight the broadcast networks decision to form vrs seems 
almost inevitable given that since 1985 all three have changed 
hands or leadership at cbs under laurence a tisch at the merged 
capital citiesabc inc and at nbc under general electric the 
mandate has been to cut costs 
the new arrangment does nothing to prevent any or all of the 
networks from projecting the winner of a presidential election 
before polls close in the west mitofsky said the only longterm 
solution to that problem is a federal uniform pollclosing law 
mitofsky said the oldstyle competition wasnt more accurate 
than vrs all three tended toward more than 99 percent accuracy 
with less pressure to be first the process should be even more 
accurate mitofsky said 
one of the criticisms of what were doing is that therell be 
no way to correct mistakes said mitofsky who for two decades 
headed cbs election unit this is absolute nonsense 
projections derive from three statistical models the first and 
fastest is the exit poll interviews with voters who have cast 
their ballots 
then comes the key precinct model precincts which historically 
have reflected larger voting trends and finally there is the 
county model where projections are based on actual raw vote 
totals 
when you get all done with the three sources of projections 
you then end up with the tabulation of the vote mitofsky said 
this is a selfcorrecting process i dont need to get a phone 
call from nbc to tell me when ive made a mistake 
creating vrs has not been painless negotiations began after the 
1988 elections and concluded only in february of this year the vrs 
questionnaires were designed by negotiation among the network 
election units 
above and beyond that basic service vrs participants can buy 
unilateral polling and projections cbs with the new york 
times has done exactly that arranging for an independent poll of 
voter attitudes 
there is a precedent for vrs the news election service the 
votecounting pool established by abc cbs nbc united press 
international and the associated press in the late 1960s 
vrs is a collection agency and provides only one projection 
said carolyn smith head of abcs election unit vrs provides no 
analysis it is up to the individual network to make the proper 
conclusions and interpretations of the exit polls 
the stuff each network puts out should be more interesting 
she said because weve been able to spend more time figuring out 
what were going to do with this information instead of being 
constantly pressured to be firstest with the mostest 
i assume that the other networks have their own resources and 
may very well come up with their own conclusions even to the 
extent that we may be using a common pool of exit polling said 
marty plisner executive political director for cbs news and a vrs 
project overseer 
the four different networks each have their own style own 
people own signature and to a considerable degree their own 
following plisner said youll know whether youre watching 
cbs or nbc he said beyond that theres a lot more to an 
election than who won and what time you know it 
the most obvious change for viewers should be the way networks 
announce the projections mitofsky said he has asked the networks 
to credit vrs i told them they should he said id like to 
think that they will

for boston waitress nancy wilson tables are 
empty tips are smaller and taxes are higher 
im an angry voter she says 
she is not alone throughout the recessionstruck northeast 
voters are rebelling against ballooning budgets and taxes as the 
nov 6 elections approach 
already they have drummed out an old generation of political 
incumbents some like democratic governors michael dukakis of 
massachusetts william a oneill of connecticut and madeleine 
kunin of vermont without even casting a ballot all retired 
rather than face the wrath of the voters 
the economic bowling ball has rolled through the northeast and 
many political leaders have gone flying says lee miringoff 
director of the marist college institute for public opinion in 
poughkeepsie ny 
whats more voters in massachusetts are so mad they are 
reviving the tax revolt that began in california in the 1970s and 
spread to massachusetts in 1980 voters then radically slashed 
property taxes levied by town governments and propositions 13 and 
2 became household words 
this time around its known as question 3 a referendum that 
would roll back increases in the state income tax and some fees 
imposed over the past two years and eliminate hundreds of new items 
and services added to the sales tax 
the message nationally if it passes is that the tax revolt 
is still alive and well even in liberal massachusetts says 
william schneider a political analyst with the american enterprise 
institute in washington and a visiting professor at boston college 
with the deficit crisis in washington politicians even 
president bush assume you can pass new taxes and voters will 
understand says schneider so what theyre debating is who 
pays the middle class the rich how the tax burden is 
distributed the message will be not so fast the voters may not 
be reconciled to tax increases even in the midst of a fiscal 
crisis 
the northeast elections promise to be among the nations most 
exciting because of the tax revolt tough economic times tight 
races and the emergence of a new generation of politicians who 
campaigned as outsiders 
and the election could serve as an informal democratic 
presidential referendum for gov mario cuomo of new york and us 
sen bill bradley of new jersey both are expected to be reelected 
over weak challengers but both must win by comfortable margins wo 
keep their political options open 
cuomo seeking a third fouryear term appeared most vulnerable 
this year new yorks credit rating dropped to the third worst in 
the nation only a step above massachusetts and louisiana cuomo 
and the state legislature approved a budget that included a record 
18 billion tax increase 
still as the bowling ball rolled through the northeast mario 
cuomo has remained standing very firmly said marist colleges 
miringoff 
he said that although cuomo is not as popular as he was four 
years ago he is still within striking distance of his record 65 
percent of the vote in 1986 his opponent pierre rinfret has run 
a bumbling illfinanced campaign 
this is not a good time for the northeast unemployment rates 
exceed the national average bankruptcy filings and welfare 
applications have doubled and tripled banks have failed the real 
estate market has collapsed problem loans and repossessed real 
estate have nearly doubled to more than 36 billion 
sales tax and other collections fell short of projections 
yielding large budget deficits tax increases and more layoffs 
massachusetts alone had a record deficit of more than 1 billion in 
the last fiscal year 
three months into the new fiscal year the budget is still 
running astray forcing dukakis to cut spending by another 500 
million all of this in stunning contrast to the massachusetts 
miracle that dukakis boasted of in his failed quest for the 
presidency 
it was a miracle that it lasted as long as it did because of a 
lack of real leadership says gary arnold the owner of process 
control industries inc in taunton a city 35 miles south of 
boston whose economic decline was reversed during the boom years 
process control industries had 200 employees on its payroll 18 
months ago the work force has been cut in half and arnold says the 
company is in a position to move almost at any good opportunity 
the cost of staying in this state is a key issue arnold 
says obviously thats taxes i sure hope the state gets managed 
a lot better theres no attraction to stay here 
in septembers primary arnold and other voters ousted 
democratic incumbents linked to the dukakis administration 
instead as an independent he cast his ballot for the republican 
gubernatorial candidate william weld who beat his own partys 
endorsed candidate 
weld a former assistant us attorney general in the reagan 
administration is in a close race with the democratic candidate 
john silber who is on leave as president of boston university he 
too defeated the partys endorsed candidate campaigning as an 
outsider 
weld supports the tax rollback silber opposes it 
supporters say the dukakis administration increased state 
spending by 92 percent during the last seven years almost three 
times the rate of inflation and left massachusetts with the 
sixthhighest tax burden in the nation 
opponents say the measure would devastate the economy rolling 
back 1 billion already collected and spent and costing the state 
more than 2 billion in the next fiscal year 
domenic bozzotto he broke ranks with the aflcio and threw the 
support of his 5000member local 26 hotel workers union of 
boston behind the tax repeal referendum even more startling was 
the unions endorsement of a republican candidate weld for the 
first time in its 103yearold history 
we never endorsed a republican candidate for anything not 
even dog catcher said bozzotto the president of the union 
our members and their spouses work two three four jobs an 
average hotel worker probably makes somewhere around 17000 to 
20000 a year if they work one job clearly they cant survive 
if we dont grab these guys by the throat at the statehouse and 
make them accountable it will just be business as usual 
that same sentiment is echoed in vermont where kunins 
predecessor republican richard snelling is the favorite with a 
campaign pegged to the states faltering economy he blames kunin 
and in connecticut the democratic partys twodecade hold on 
the governors office is in jeopardy because of the fallout from 
two years of tax hikes totaling more than 1 billion the favorite 
is lowell p wiecker jr the former republican us senator who is 
running as an independent 
voters in new jersey have much outrage but little outlet for it 
a 28 billion tax increase that has made democrat jim florio one 
of the most unpopular governors in the nation 
florio does not come up for reelection for another three years 
and the democratic legislature also has a free pass this year the 
state constitution has no provision for referendum or recall of 
elected officials 
bradleys republican opponent christine whitman has tried to 
direct some of the anger at bradley demanding that he take a stand 
on the state tax issue but bradley has refused

happy halloween viewers our topic is bad 
television television that does not create a burden on the 
viewers wit and intellect but induces a vaccuum this is tv so 
bad its scary 
aaaggggghhhhhhhhh 
please save your screams for the end 
were talking about tv that represents deformities in the 
national character tv that speaks of profound problems in the 
republic 
when future historians close the books on our era they may 
forgive american culture for the aberrant values implicit in the 
beverly hillbillies theyll probably call it classic 
television the french will honor gilligans island as a work 
of genius 
it already is happening 
green acres isnt stupid its surreal gushed cables 
nickelodeon channel in plugging its revival of the show 
thats the strange thing about bad television it is preserved 
in reruns until the dignity of age and nostalgia accrete to it 
mediocre tv sinks without a trace bad tv becomes a cultural 
artifact a precious relic of bygone days 
precious relics of the 70s and 80s 
heres a bottom 10 list in ascending order of horror 
 
10 threes company from midseason in 1977 to 1984 this 
show epitomized the central values of the 1970s much like disco 
and leisure suits it was and is appalling 
the premise if that is what it can be called was that two 
women and one man suzanne somers joyce dewitt and john ritter 
were capable of hilarious sexual tension and innuendo while 
chastely sharing an apartment 
this menage was acceptable to the ropers their virtually 
impotent landlord and his sexstarved wife who labored under the 
misapprehension that the male tenant was homosexual a laff riot 
the writing was as predictable as the tides the conflicts were 
trivial the humor sophomoric and the acting ludicrously bad to 
nonexistent at a loss for comic ideas the writers would have 
somers sunbathe when in doubt jiggle 
the show wrecked somers career after she made salary demands 
inconsistent with the producers estimate of her worth john ritter 
may recover joyce dewitt is a future trivia question 
and it is said there is always an episode of threes 
company playing somewhere 
 
9 tie the love boat and fantasy island mind 
candy was how these hourlong abc anthology series were described 
by their fans 
love boat followed a cruise ship and its crew members with 
secondtier guest stars occupying three story lines about couples 
facing various impediments to the course of true love this show 
made barbi benton a star 
it is impossible to convey the unreality of love boat 
situations and characters because they obeyed conventions of 
thought behavior and dress that existed only on television 
sometimes only on the love boat 
fantasy island flouted those conventions ricardo montalban 
played the mysterious host of a resort island where by magic his 
guests lived out their fantasies it featured comic oddity herve 
villechaize whose role consisted mainly of croaking da plane 
boss da plane 
love boat picked up fans in syndication after lauren tewes 
hi im julie your cruise director was fired because of a 
raging debilitating cocaine addiction that remains obvious to even 
the most casual viewer 
it also produced a us congressman harvardeducated fred

connection with host chuck woolery has been introducing couples

3 thats incredible abcs answer to nbcs 1979 genuinely 
innovative real people which featured various eccentrics 
human interest stories and bits of americana 
thats incredible staged stunts that were incredible 
including a daredevil who was severely burned when he ran through a 
tunnel of fire another featured guest an inventor later was 
indicted on federal fraud charges 
an expose by tv guide in 1982 revealed several of the shows 
stunts were faked but it didnt leave the air until 1984 
thats incredible 
 
2 supertrain one of the costliest flops in network 
history nbcs 1979 supertrain was a huge nuclearpowered 
luxury train a love boat on rails that had a steam room pool 
gym disco and no discernible ideas 
it was laughed off the air after a month brought back a month 
later and finally vanished into nielsen gulch 
 
1 turnon developed in 1969 by laughin and real 
people creator george schlatter turnon was very much in the 
manner of laughin by all accounts it was far too suggestive 
for its era which puts it on the milder side of married with 
children 
after one broadcast of turnon 75 affiliates that had tuned 
in dropped out abc canceled it by the end of the week 
 
is there a lesson for the 90s in all this bad television yes 
we are what we have beheld

caterpillar inc is cashing in on the end of 
us trade sanctions against soviet bloc countries by selling 212 
earthmoving machines to the romanian government for use in coal 
mining 
an analyst said tuesday the deal could be worth 50 million for 
caterpillar and may help the company reclaim eastern bloc markets 
lost to the japanese during the reagan administration embargo 
its a very significant deal for caterpillar said frank 
manfredi of manfredi and associates a buffalo grove illbased 
analyst of the heavy machinery industry 
under a barter agreement announced monday romania will receive 
200 articulated dump trucks 10 tracktype tractors a motor grader 
and a wheelloader 
the equipment will be delivered during the next nine months 
said jeff hawkinson spokesman for caterpillar the worlds largest 
manufacturer of earthmoving equipment 
this will boost caterpillars market share considerably 
manfredi said its a pretty big deal when you consider the world 
market for articulated trucks is about 3000 units annually and 
they just sold 200 or about 7 percent of the world market in one 
deal thats not bad 
caterpillar released few details about the deal but manfredi 
estimated its value at approximately 50 million based on a 
price range of 100000 to 170000 for articulated dump trucks 
commonly used on projects with rough terrain and bad conditions 
the huge offroad vehicles are built in two sections and bend in 
the middle for turning rather than using conventional steering in 
which the wheels turn from sidetoside 
normally these trucks are not used in mining operations 
manfredi said that must mean romanias roads must be in pretty 
bad shape around their mining operations 
manfredi speculated the 10 tractors are likely large bulldozers 
worth upwards of 500000 apiece and the company usually sends a 
supply of spare parts in package deals which would push the value 
even higher 
the cashpoor country will pay for the equipment with 
unspecified romanian goods and services 
thaddeus kopinski director of the office of central and eastern 
europe for the us chamber of commerce in washington said romania 
may be paying caterpillar with forklift trucks 
romanias chief export item is forklift trucks kopinski 
said its part of their materialhandling sector and it fits 
into caterpillars profile 
manfredi said the barter agreement gives caterpillar an 
advantage over competitors who are unable to accept such conditions 
for sales 
prior to the reagan trade embargo caterpillar was the 
supplier of choice to the soviet union and eastern bloc countries 
for years manfredi said 
caterpillar chairman donald fites told a group of visiting 
soviet journalists last month that caterpillar held 85 percent of 
the world market of imported mining equipment in the soviet union 
in 1981 
those customers were forfeited to caterpillars chief 
competitor komatsu and other japanese manufacturers during the 
embargo 
caterpillar has reclaimed about 50 percent of the lost business 
fites said 
manfrei said the numbers are the same for eastern bloc nations 
such as romania 
hawkinson said the sale to romania is the first in more than 10 
years for caterpillar and he called it one of the companys 
biggest deals in eastern europe in a number of years 
hawkinson said caterpillar sees eastern europe as a market with 
great potential because of the regions deteriorated 
infrastructure

president mikhail s gorbachevs plan for 
switching to a freemarket economy backs away from a 500day 
timetable and boris n yeltsin leader of the russian republic 
said it was doomed to fail within six months 
gorbachevs 66page blueprint delivered to members of the 
national legislature tuesday is at least the fourth in a confusing 
and complicated series of plans for salvaging the failing economy 
another endeavor is thus being made to perpetuate the system 
hated by the people yeltsin said tuesday the new program is a 
catastrophe which will break out within the first few months 
if the parliament approves todays uncompromising program 
it will take less than six months to realize that the chosen road 
is another blunder a text of yeltsins remarks to the russian 
federations legislature was published today in sovietskaya 
rossiya the russian communist newspaper 
gorbachevs plan would give the 15 soviet republics sweeping new 
powers to run the nations economy free many prices from 
government regulation and allow private ownership of businesses it 
sets no timetable for the transition but notes other nations have 
accomplished similar goals in 1 to two years 
gorbachev is to present his plan to the supreme soviet national 
legislature on friday and the 542 members could vote on it as 
early as saturday parliamentary committees began studying the 
proposals today 
yeltsin president of the russian republic and the federations 
other leaders have endorsed a radical plan for scrapping communist 
central planning for a marketbased economy in 500 days 
yeltsin said the russian republic could go ahead with that 
program on nov 1 setting up its own currency customs service and 
army 
he acknowledged this would be difficult and costly even for the 
biggest and wealthiest of the 15 soviet republics but said if 
we show indecision in such a situation we will lose the voters 
trust and respect 
if we procrastinate and put off the reform further there 
will be nothing to reform because the economy will simply fall to 
pieces he said 
yeltsin said gorbachevs program if adopted would increase the 
national budget deficit to about 528 billion 
the consumer market inevitably will be swamped by a shower of 
paper money and prices may grow dozens of times he said 
the plan yeltsin has endorsed is named after its chief 
architect economist stanislav shatalin it differs from 
gorbachevs plan in several key respects 
the shatalin plan suggests selling factories to private owners 
breaking up collective farms and returning land to peasants but 
the gorbachev plan drops a clear commitment to private ownership of 
land it says only that republic authorities will decide conditions 
for giving land to people for agriculture 
the shatalin plan would also gradually end all state control on 
prices under the gorbachev plan the government would still set 
prices in 1992 on bread meat dairy products and a few other 
staples 
yeltsin said the gorbachev plan was an attempt to preserve the 
administrativebureaucratic system 
the proposal caps an intensive threeweek effort by gorbachev 
and top economists to resolve fundamental differences over how to 
change a system that fails to provide adequate food shelter and 
services for the countrys 285 million people 
differences among competing economic plans have touched on the 
very underpinnings of soviet communism socialist property 
collective labor and state ownership of all land 
peoples lives are becoming more difficult their interest in 
labor is falling their faith in the future is crumbling the 
gorbachev plan says 
it says the long lines in which soviet shoppers must stand daily 
are a shame and acknowledges rising food prices overcrowded 
apartments and empty store shelves 
but it hesitates to move ahead too quickly with reform stating 
the experience of applying stabilization programs in other 
countries shows that such a period can take about 1 to two 
years 
gorbachevs compromise package however borrows heavily from 
the shatalin plan in giving republics more economic power 
under gorbachevs plan republics would gain control of most of 
the resources on their territory after delegating much economic 
power to republics businesses and individuals the central 
government would concentrate on defense energy highways 
railroads space exploration and communications 
gorbachev originally supported the shatalin plan which was to 
have gone into effect oct 1 but the sinking union national 
government put pressure on the president and he again changed his 
mind yeltsin said

a top official of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries strongly criticized oil consuming 
countries on wednesday for failing to release oil reserves to help 
curb rising oil prices 
opec secretary general subroto said consumer countries have been 
reminded that it might be too late to keep oil prices within 
reasonable bounds if they waited until the fourth quarter of the 
year to release their strategic stocks 
unfortunately these appeals proved fruitless this is a great 
pity and a clear indication that the concept of real 
cooperation between producers and consumers for oil market 
stability still seems to fall on the deaf ears of the majority 
subroto said 
he said that opec has already acted to reduce the danger of an 
oil shortage by pumping out as much oil as it can 
the ball is now in the consumers court it is now up to them 
to bolster the markets defense against an impending energy 
shortage by drawing down on their stocks he told an 
international energy conference in jakarta 
paul vlaanderen representative of the international energy 
agency told the conference earlier that its analysis showed that 
world crude oil markets are still adequately supplied and no 
product shortfalls have been experienced by its members 
vlaanderen said the agency acknowledged that the oil markets are 
nervous in the wake of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait but the 
situation still is manageable 
he said prices are fluctuating based upon fears of war or hopes 
for peace in the persian gulf and the current strains on the oil 
system are unlikely to be remedied by a simple drawdown of iea 
strategic stocks 
it is a political phenomenon and not a supplydemand 
fundamental which drives the market physical shortages do not 
explain present price fluctuations he said 
subroto told the conference that opecs total sustainable 
production capacity would increase from the current 28 million 
barrels to 34 million barrels a day in 1995 
he said nonopec production would remain unchanged or fall 
slightly by the end of century and oil supply from the communist 
countries would decline largely because of lower soviet production 
and higher consumption in china 
demand for opec oil increased from 1545 million barrels a day 
in 1985 to 2191 million barrels in 1989 this year the figure is 
expected to reach 23 million barrels 
helga steeg executive director of the international energy 
agency said member countries of the organization for economic 
cooperation and development would grow more dependent on imports 
due not only to rising oil demand but also to a decline in their 
oil production 
mrs steeg said in a prepared statement that oecds dependence 
on imports could rise from 53 percent in 1988 to 70 percent by 
2005 
the oecd members include the united states germany japan and 
other industrial nations

the company that brought the allpurpose 
swiss army pocketknife to america is now offering products that do 
more than open wine bottles strip wire or gut fish 
forschner group inc the us distributor of the multiblade red 
knives with silver crosses has expanded into the sunglass and 
watch business with its new subsidiary swiss army brands ltd 
the company is banking on consumers familiarity with the swiss 
army name to get these products off the ground 
there is a highquality imagery associated with the knife 
said forschner president james kennedy it has always been known 
as a useful utilitarian product and we were able to transfer that 
to the watchs image 
sales of the swiss army brand watch totaled around 4 million 
since its debut last fall double the projections said kennedy 
the simple watch with a large face big numbers and black strap 
was designed in the united states and manufactured in switzerland 
it sells for 95 retail 
the swiss army brand aviatorstyle sunglasses were introduced in 
april and sell for around 115 retail but sales have been 
disappointing thus far totaling just 385000 in the first nine 
months of this year kennedy said the glasses came out too late to 
be included in many retailers summer catalogs 
the new products are targeted at upscale outdoorsy types who 
frequent camping and hunting stores the company does minimal 
advertising and its products are sold by exclusive retailers such 
as hoffritz for cutlery eddie bauer and hammacher schlemmer 
the swissbased victorinox cutlery co founded in 1884 by karl 
elsener developed the original swiss army knife in 1891 its 
patent on the pocketknife expired in 1908 and since then many 
imitations have surfaced 
about half the soldiers in the swiss army carry victorinox 
knives the rest are manufactured by their rival wenger which 
also sells swiss army knives in the united states through retailers 
like k mart and l l bean 
victorinox makes 295 different models of the knife but 
forschner sells only about 50 in the united states 
the scientist model features a magnifying glass while the 
tinker contains two can openers and a phillips screwdriver a 
saw pliers scissors and a file are part of the craftsman 
forschner became a distributor for the pocketknives shortly 
after world war ii the company started out 135 years ago in new 
britain selling only butcher scales in the 1930s it added 
victorinox butcher knives to its line 
the butcher knives sold almost exclusively to slaughterhouses 
and restaurants accounted for 27 percent of forschners business 
last year another 23 percent came from swiss army knives printed 
with corporate logos the other half came from the pocketknives 
when kennedy came to work at the company in 1975 it decided to 
stop selling butcher scales and to halt sales of the pocketknives 
to its 40 wholesaers forschner began selling the pocketknives 
directly to specialty retail stores 
imitation knives have plagued forschner for years but when 
knockoffs of the watches started showing up in stores for 2025 
the company took immediate action against some asian manufacturers 
for violating trade laws 
since the knockoffs were not manufactured in switzerland the 
companies making them were not allowed to call them swissstyle or 
swisslike and were prohibited from using the trademark swiss 
cross 
such restrictions also have limited forschners growth 
we have to have all our products made in switzerland where 
the factories are small inefficient and expensive kennedy said 
he added that the strength of the swiss franc has added to his 
purchase price 
nonetheless in the past 16 years forschners profits have 
grown 4000 percent last year forschner sold 33 million worth of 
knives up from less than 1 million in 1974

after failing to offer hard evidence that 
michael milken masterminded a 1986 stock manipulation prosecutors 
will move to a second transaction they say paints the junk bond 
king as a rampant criminal 
milken 44 has pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to 
illegal trading but the government wants to demonstrate he 
deserves a long prison term for allegedly engaging in broader 
lawbreaking during his career 
testimony concluded tuesday without a smoking gun that milken 
ordered wickes cos stock manipulated upward in april 1986 via 
large purchases by former speculator ivan boesky 
legal experts said the governments case so far was surprisingly 
weak even though there is a lower burden of proof in the hearing 
than a trial wickes was prosecutors first choice for proving the 
extra wrongdoing by milken 
what really puzzles me is why the government didnt anticipate 
this was going to be a letdown and choose some other transactions 
and witnesses said alan bromberg a securities law professor at 
southern methodist university 
it strikes me the government may be caught up in the web of 
its own conspiracy theory that everything that happened was part 
of this grand conspiracy between milken and boesky he said 
us district judge kimba wood appeared skeptical of aspects of 
the governments case fairly ambiguous is how she described 
orders allegedly made by milken to manipulate wickes as described 
by a former drexel trader 
wood ordered the presentencing hearing to gain greater insight 
into milkens character before she decides his punishment he has 
agreed to pay 600 million in penalties and faces up to 28 years in 
prison 
the proceeding marks the first test of the governments evidence 
against milken after a fouryear pursuit of the former drexel 
burnham lambert inc financier that included a 98count 
racketeering and fraud indictment 
at the end of testimony monday milken lawyer arthur liman 
suggested calling off the rest of the hearing because it only was 
polarizing the case and not helping wood fashion a sentence 
courtroom observers said liman was satisfied with the defense on 
wickes and may have been seeking an end before the second and third 
alleged illegal transactions against milken are aired 
but judge wood said so far the hearings have been very 
helpful to the court they are filling a certain type of void 
although i am questioning the government closely at this point i 
havent reached any conclusions 
the governments case in wickes hinged on the testimony of a 
former drexel trader who claimed milken was involved in 
manipulating wickes but the trader and two other government 
witnesses offered no direct connection between milken with boesky 
assistant us attorney john carroll asserted that given the 
nature of milkens other admitted schemes with boesky he was linked 
to the wickes manipulation wood dismissed that argument 
the governments case now shifts to two other transactions from 
its 132page presentencing memorandum that portrays milken as a 
greedy cheater the defense claims his crimes involved isolated 
instances of going too far to help clients and they have requested 
no prison time 
the hearing is to resume thursday with testimony on allegations 
of misappropriations and bribery in securities of storer 
communications inc in 1985 the third transaction alleges insider 
trading in securities of caesars world inc in 1983 
on tuesday the government implied but offered no proof that the 
prospect of multimilliondollar fees may have motivated milken and 
drexel to break the law to help wickes retire an expensive 
preferred security 
under questioning by carroll former drexel corporate finance 
executive joseph harch said there were many positives to 
retiring the costly preferred stock issue 
but harch testifying for the defense said wickes chairman 
sanford sigoloff never asked drexel to buy wickes stock to push up 
its price and milken never told him any such activity would occur 
harch said drexel did not undertake any financing solely to 
preserve wickes as a client 
former drexel trader peter gardiner testified monday that milken 
asked traders to find buyers for wickes and said to him peter 
wickes 6lsqb gardiner said he interpreted that as an order to 
close the stock at that level 
liman conceded wickes was manipulated but said milken played no 
role

a hong kong businessman announced wednesday he 
has received a strong response from bank lenders to a request for 
an 800 million loan to finance the construction of a superhighway 
in southern china 
the loan would be one of the biggest since the june 4 1989 
military attack on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing which 
resulted in a drastic decline in foreign lending for chinabased 
business plans 
gordon wu managing director of hopewell holdings ltd said 
documents have been given to 20 local and foreign banks to solicit 
funds and initial responses had been overwhelming 
we have no problem at all in getting the money now we have to 
persuade some banks to give us less he said 
wu declined to identify the participating banks but said half 
are japanese nor would he disclose the pricing terms although it 
was believed that the loans interest rate will be substantially 
above the london interbank offered rate the rate banks in london 
charge each other for dollardenominated loans 
wu said the breakdown of the banks would be announced later this 
month 
the 12year syndicated loan is regarded as one of the barometers 
of foreign banks confidence in china because of its size and long 
term commitment 
since june of last year most major foreign banks have suspended 
medium to long term loans to china due to the uncertain political 
outlook in the mainland 
loans that have been given have been generally done in 
consortium like hopewells loan because bankers remain wary 
earlier this year the the mitsubishi trust and banking co 
arranged a 126 million loan 
the 143mile highway linking the southern chinese city of 
canton and its neighboring boom towns of zhuhai and shenzhen would 
take four years to complete and the first section between canton 
and shenzhen would be completed within a year wu said 
with a total investment of 12 billion he said the highway 
would help to ease already heavy traffic among the three cities 
considered to be the richest in china 
wu said he has encountered no difficulty so far in the project 
apart from securing land for construction work 
chinas bank of china and this british colonys hongkong and 
shanghai corp are responsible for the underwriting arrangements 
and wu said japanese banks had so far indicated their readiness to 
provide more than half of the 800 million

ronald li former chairman of the hong kong 
stock exchange was convicted wednesday in the high court on 
corruption charges 
a sevenmember jury deliberated for more than 10 hours before 
convicting li of accepting preferential offerings of shares in 
cathay pacific airways ltd and novel enterprises ltd in 1986 and 
1987 in exchange for helping to obtain listings on the market for 
the companies shares 
li 61 had pleaded innocent to the charges the jury convicted 
li by a margin of 52 sufficient in hong kong to find a defendant 
guilty 
he faces a maximum penalty of seven years in prison and 64000 
in fines on each of two counts 
li was a powerful figure in this british colonys stockbroking 
community for two decades 
in the trial michael kalisher the lead prosecutor described 
li as the patriarch of an exclusive society funded by friendly 
merchant bankers 
it was a very cozy little club he said in court 
he alleged li made more than 100000 in profits by selling the 
shares he was awarded 
in defense li compared himself to the owner of a restaurant who 
knows what the meals are but not how they are prepared 
li was instrumental in merging the colonys four exchanges into 
the hong kong stock exchange four years ago turning the stock 
market of this british colony into one of the most dynamic in the 
world 
his decision to close the exchange for four days during the 
world stock market crash in october of 1987 led to calls for his 
resignation 
he stepped down as chairman of the exchange one month before he 
was arrested in january 1988 
between lis arrest and his appearance in court prosecutors 
dropped 13 charges lodged against him under the colonys bribery 
prevention ordinance because of lack of evidence 
li faces other charges along with seven former members of the 
exchange scheduled to be tried in february

the white house today urged the house to 
overcome its objections to senatepassed legislation providing 
child care assistance to low income families and to endorse the 
senate version 
the latest senate version unveiled by democratic and republican 
leaders tuesday is a fiveyear 15 billion package most of the 
money would go for an expansion of earned income tax credits for 
lowincome working families with children 
this is a great step forward for parents child care and 
education we urge the house to pass it in its current form said 
president bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater today 
a second element is a new program of grants to the states which 
would pass the money along to childcare centers or directly to 
families to offset part of their child care costs churchrun 
centers would be eligible for the federal aid 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and minority 
leader bob dole rkan described the package as a compromise that 
has president bushs support and said it would break a long 
deadlock over the child care bill 
but house members were excluded from negotiations with the white 
house over the package and the latest version fell short in scope 
and spending from a version passed earlier this year by the house 
at least one key house sponsor said he would not go along with 
the senates deal 
there are enormous differences said rep tom downey dny 
dole in response said the house would be to blame if child 
care fails to pass now its time for the house to join the 
senate and the white house so this priority legislation doesnt die 
before congress adjourns he said 
federal child care assistance was backed by both presidential 
candidates in 1988 but the issue has been stuck in conference 
committees since clearing the house and senate with congress 
nearing adjournment and consumed by deficitreduction battles the 
outlook for a childcare bill had appeared to be worsening 
part of the new agreement is a strategy to bypas the deadlocked 
house and senate conferees who have been unable to resolve 
differences 
mitchell said the bill would be included in the senates budget 
deficitreduction bill adding child care to the taxincrease and 
spendingcut package that congress is trying to pass before a 
midnight friday deadline 
downey however said the house would resist that move 
under the new agreement grants to the states for aid to 
families with childcare costs would amount to 25 billion over 
three years compared with 6 billion over five years in earlier 
versions downey said the senates plan was inadequate and that 
twice as much was needed 
the senate bill also includes licensing health and safety 
requirements for daycare centers although they are weaker than 
those the house was seeking 
the measure authorizes the grants to the states as a separate 
program requiring yearly appropriations house backers fearing 
child care would suffer in the yearly competition for money had 
rejected that approach in favor of making it an entitlement program 
under the social security act so it would be automatically included 
in the budget annually 
also excluded from the senatewhite house version is a section 
in the house bill providing money to help local governments 
establish or expand childcare programs based in the public 
schools 
the new version would earmark a quarter of the grants to be used 
for early childhood education and before and afterschool child 
care services 
the agreement has the support of the childrens defense fund an 
advocacy group that has pushed for child care and which has battled 
the house leadership over the method 
this is a start a beginning of a federal childcare program 
that provides a strong base on which to build said helen blank 
lobbyist for the fund

helmeted and harnessed du pont co 
workers grunt groan and sweat as they scale a 40foot wall climb 
a skinny 30foot pole and zip down a 300foot wire 
they cheer each other on with shouts of you can do it 
were behind ya how do you feel 
with a break for a brownbag lunch theyve finished the first 
half of the daylong ropes course the introduction to du pont 
fibers departments playing to win seminars and empowered 
learning teams 
the idea is to keep fibers competitive and increase productivity 
of employees who can work better with supervisors and each other 
said clifford e nix fibers development director 
the company is spending at least 23 million on the effort it 
paid 13 million for the 45acre campsite on the elk river in 
northeastern maryland it leases resorts for fibers employees to 
take the same training at two sites in north carolina and one in 
virginia and tennessee all of the sites are near du pont fibers 
plants 
the seminars four days for managers and two days for employees 
with their managers are similar to the wilderness training 
courses that became popular among corporate executives in the 
1980s 
but du ponts program which began about four months ago is 
unique because it is inhouse and is required for all 20000 
employees in the fibers department which makes polyester nylon 
spandex and other materials 
the company has contracted with pecos river learning centers of 
santa fe nm to provide the training 
what we want to create is a work environment where peoples 
values can truly be expressed with the team and having an 
environment where those values can be brought to the surface and 
having the freedom to express that nix said 
that means changing management style 
the key to the success of this whole effort is the willingness 
of the leadership to embrace change themselves theres room for 
change but the leadership has to let go and shift our behavior and 
our roles as leaders in the organization nix said 
there have been a lot of companies experimenting with what we 
call employee involvement programs its based upon an 
established theory that if employees are involved in the 
decisionmaking process morale and productivity will go up said 
douglas m mccabe a labor relations expert and professor at 
georgetown university in washington 
james h wilbur a securities analyst with smith barney harris 
upham amp co said the timing is right because fibers earnings are 
likely to fall short of last years so if you can get the people 
to work together and be productive it couldnt come at a better 
time than when things are tight 
he said earnings in the fibers department which represent 
nearly a quarter of du ponts total profits have been hurt by a 
rise in foreign competition and raw materials costs the divisions 
first quarter profit fell to 168 million from 173 million last 
year second quarter earnings dropped to 157 million from 182 
million 
miles overholt a management consultant and family therapist 
said the program can be successful if du pont sustains enthusiasm 
among its employees 
any kind of program thats out on the market now such as 
pecos river are great as a kickoff because the message is clear 
its direct its concise the hard part is continuing it said 
overholt president of applied organizational development inc of 
palmyra nj 
mccabe of georgetown university said the new approach can be 
sustained only if top management is totally dedicated to the 
proposition of employee involvement 
trust has to be a very strong value of the organization 
trusting each other in that work environment industry as a whole 
has got to embrace that value nix said 
when the training began employees were skeptical and it was 
difficult to get them to attend now the courses are booked 
through june 1991 
more than 3000 employees have been trained at the sites since 
the first one opened in june in virginia at natural bridge 
each week that goes by my conviction grows its much 
different today than the way i felt in may or june you wondered if 
people were going to get on the bus to go to the sites nix said 
people who havent gone through it generally dont know what 
to think of it those who have gone through it there has been a 
good response but there still appears to be a waitandsee 
attitude said nancy tidona du pont spokeswoman 
nix said the teams will continue training with 10 fourhour 
seminars in the workplace spread over 18 months after visiting the 
wilderness site 
when the entire department has completed all of the training he 
said he expects fibers to be in a more competitive position for 
the future i expect more unity and more productivity 
but the program hasnt been without its problems george w 
martin a 58yeraold plant supervisor died of a heart attack in 
september after completing one of ropes course activities 
nix said the only other accident has been a sprained ankle 
employees with medical problems are excused from the exercises he 
said 
after each activity the teams are debriefed to discuss how the 
activity relates to their work 
the concept behind three people hooked together to scale a 
40foot wall is to make a group decision on whether to make it to 
the top there should be no hard feelings if a member does not want 
to go on tidona said 
you can only go as far as your weakest team members she 
said 
i expect when its all over ill probably be a little more 
open with my peers and be more supportive of others employee 
richard block said on the first day of a recent fourday seminar

donald ray dixon whose involvement in one of the 
biggest and most lurid thrift collapses in history has been 
overshadowed by the cases of neil bush and charles keating is 
getting his day in court 
jury selection began today for the former owner of vernon 
savings and loan association which went under in 1987 at a cost of 
13 billion he is charged with conspiracy misapplication of 
funds and other crimes 
jurors should be picked within two days and lawyers are 
expected to make opening statements friday testimony is set to 
begin monday and continue three to four weeks 
perhaps when my day in court comes if theyll listen theyll 
find out what really happened and the blame can be properly 
assessed and properly assigned dixon has said 
prosecutors say dixon 50 spent hundreds of thousands in thrift 
money on yachting and hunting trips worldwide travel to gourmet 
restaurants antique cars a california beach house prostitutes 
and contributions to politicians 
dixon has said the government is trying to make him a scapegoat 
for the nations sampl scandal 
until the recent notoriety given bush and silverado savings and 
loan in colorado or keating and lincoln savings and loan in 
california dixon and vernon were at or near the top of the list of 
alleged abuses cited in the industry 
regulators have accused president bushs 35yearold son and 
other silverado directors of negligence keating faces criminal and 
civil charges from his involvement at lincoln 
if convicted on all counts dixon could get 190 years in prison 
and 95 million in fines 
twelve other vernon executives and associates have been 
convicted the verdicts against two of them have been set aside 
dixon lived lavishly traveling the world for gourmet parties 
and acquiring along the way such playthings as a 17th century 
castle door baccarat crystal sculptures a silvedstudded saddle 
and a posh house near san diego 
the government says those luxuries as well as payments to 
political campaigns and to prostitutes who allegedly entertained 
vernon executives were financed from the vaults at vernon which 
owned a yacht and five planes worth 6 million

civil rights leaders plan a fresh appeal to 
president bush after a major bill to combat job discrimination 
cleared the senate but without the support needed to overcome his 
threatened veto 
i am convinced this bill will have the effect of forcing 
businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and promotion bush said 
tuesday he said that if the measure reached his desk he would 
be compelled to veto it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated that position 
today saying the bill is neither sound nor practical and would 
have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and 
promotion 
the senate on tuesday night approved the measure 6234 short 
of the twothirds support that sponsors would need to override the 
threatened veto 
fiftythree democrats and nine republicans joined in supporting 
the measure while 34 republicans were opposed 
civil rights forces said they could count on the votes of three 
absent senators and thus needed only two more to reach the 67 
required for an override but the roll call revealed that despite 
many concessions they had gained no new support since july 18 when 
an earlier version cleared 6534 
the house was due to vote today on the bill which would 
effectively overturn six supreme court decisions handed down last 
year it has been the civil rights movements top piority on 
capitol hill in recent months 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages in extreme discrimination cases 
the major controversy though is over proposed changes in 
complex court rules governing job discrimination lawsuits the 
changes would make it easier for those filing suit to win and 
harder for employers to defend themselves 
the administration and business critics of the bill say 
employers would adopt quotas as a readymade defense in case they 
were taken to court sponsors of the bill scoff at this notion 
civil rights leaders who visited with bush in may in an effort 
to reach a compromise plan to ask for another chance to make the 
pitch for the bill and head off a veto 
this is going to be a defining issue for the bush 
administration and civil rights said ralph neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
he said a veto could resemble the bob jones university 
fiasco in which a storm erupted the reagan administrations move 
to grant taxexempt status to that institution despite charges that 
it practiced discrimination 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said i believe there is a 
good chance that president bush will sign this bill but if he 
vetoes it i think there is a good chance congress will override 
the veto 
sen arlen specter rpa who voted for the bill held out hope 
that even after months of disagreement the administration and 
sponsors could reach a compromise he said talks were getting under 
way again a summer of negotiations that were revived briefly in 
september have produced nothing 
some lawmakers believe bush will opt to pocket veto the 
bill allowing it to die for lack of a signature after congress 
adjourns and leaves washington for the campaign trail 
both sides in the debate have acknowledged that the sheer 
complexity of the measure has led to confusion 
it is not a battle between david duke and the rest of us 
for the soul of the republican party sen john c danforth 
rmo said it is a quibbling over words that lawyers have been 
involved in 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio was critical earlier of 
republicans for opposing the bill is this the republican party 
of abraham lincoln he said or is this the republican party of 
david duke 
gop lawmakers winced at the mention of duke a former ku klux 
klan leader and current louisiana state legislator who counts 
himself as a republican even though gop officials have taken 
enormous pains to repudiate him 
i think bringing in david duke is hitting below the belt a 
bit said sen orrin hatch rutah 
metzenbaum came back to the floor contritely later and said it 
had been inappropriate and improper to associate republicans 
with duke

the price of copper fell wednesday to its lowest 
level in two years on worries about future oversupply 
adequate supplies and the belief that the united states and 
some of the other main copperconsumer countries are heading for 
recession are behind the setback said neil buxton a metals 
researcher at the investment house lehman brothers 
we are looking for the downturn to continue for the 
foreseeable future he said 
metals traders billitonenthoven also forecast a further drop 
because of a poor outlook for demand 
copper is used mainly in wires cables and piping and brass 
fittings used by the plumbing and general engineering sectors 
the london metal exchange price of copper used by most of the 
worlds producers as the basis for their sales contracts was 
officially set on wednesday at 129950 pounds or 2560 per ton 
for forward delivery 
that was 50 pounds or 98 below tuesdays level and the lowest

delta air lines has agreed to spend 315 
million to expand its operations and nearly double its workforce at 
the greater cincinnati international airport officials announced 
today 
gov wallace wilkinson said the state has agreed to limit 
deltas annual sales tax liability on jet fuel to 4 million that 
would require an act of the general assembly and wilkinson said he 
expects it to pass 
the governor said the state also will grant tax credits worth as 
much as 15 million on the airlines increase in payroll 
the state is offering no incentive money up front for the 
expansion which is expected to add 2800 employees to the 
airlines workforce in northern kentucky 
the project will add 25 arrival and departure gates to the delta 
hub already in place at the airport in boone county the number of 
gates for international departures will double to six 
delta chairman ronald w allen who appeared with wilkinson at 
an airport news conference said the expansion would be the largest 
the airline has ever undertaken cincinnati is the airlines 
fourthlargest hub behind atlanta dallasfort worth and salt lake 
city and has been deltas fastestgrowing allen said 
the airline is to begin construction immediately and is 
scheduled to complete the project by 1994 
wilkinson said 4 million the amount of the proposed sales tax 
limit is what delta is expected to be paying at current prices in 
sales tax on aviation fuel within a year the state receives 15 
million from all airlines officials said 
it was not immediately possible to determine the full value of 
the credits and exemptions for delta but allen said delta projects 
the amount of jet fuel it purchases at the airport would roughly 
double 
the sales tax limit and other elements of the incentive package 
will be placed on the agenda of a planned special session of the 
legislature in january wilkinson said 
the tax limit would apply to any airline that invests 300 
million in kentucky and purchases at least 100 million gallons of 
fuel each year in the state

mci communications corp on wednesday reported 
a net loss of 168 million in the third quarter due to a onetime 
550 million charge to pay for modernizing its phone network 
after subtracting preferredstock dividends mci said its loss 
for the quarter ended sept 30 totaled 176 million or 69 cents 
per common share 
by comparison the nations no 2 longdistance phone company 
earned 165 million or 62 cents a share in last years third 
quarter 
mci reported revenue of 2 billion in the quarter compared with 
168 billion for the same period last year 
the latest revenue figure reflects mcis august acquisition of 
telecom usa inc the nations fourthlargest long distance 
company for 125 billion 
mci also announced in august it was considering a writedown of 
500 million to 550 million to cover the retirement of its analog 
phone network which it is converting to modern digital lines 
without the writedown and other onetime events mcis profits 
would have been up 14 percent over the yearago quarter said 
bert c roberts jr mcis president and chief operating officer 
despite the challenge of smoothly integrating telecom usa the 
company increased its share of the large account international and 
residential markets and rolled out a new service for small to 
midsize businesses 
in august mci moved up plans to have its phone network fully 
digital by the end of 1991 instead of the end of 1993 
the accelerated schedule was made possible by the acquisition of 
telecom usa which had extensive digital lines and by an agreement 
with williams cos inc under which each company can use the 
others phone network 
digital phone lines use computer language to transmit phone 
calls providing vastly clearer reception than analog lines 
for the years first nine months mci earned 172 million or 59 
cents a share vs 450 million or 169 a share a year earlier 
revenue totaled 568 billion vs 476 billion

stacy mcintire and her visitors wanted 
something with cheese and sauce so they did the obvious thing at a 
notsoobvious place 
they went out for pizza at mcdonalds 
we had company over and we fed four people on two pizzas for 
something like 12 she said we went to the drivethrough and 
didnt even have to get out of the car we got it in five 
minutes 
pizza in the land of allbeef patties special sauce lettuce 
cheese pickles onions and sesameseed buns is this a fastfood 
induced nightmare 
not at all mcdonalds which for years counted its hamburger 
sales in the billions may soon be counting pizza pasta and other 
nontraditional offerings in an attempt to boost sluggish us 
dinner sales 
owensboros four golden arches and 10 others across the ohio 
river in evansville ind are among 240 restaurants nationwide 
which are testmarketing tomato pies the 12inch pies also are 
being tested in las vegas hartford conn fresno calif and 
suburbs of chicago 
fresh carrots and celery sticks are being test marketed in 
pennsylvania and california and mcdonalds also is experimenting 
with fresh fruit and soups 
our customers are interested in a little more variety and more 
choices said melissa oakley spokeswoman at mcdonalds corps 
oak brook ill headquarters but we have to be very careful in 
what we choose were still committed to serving a limited menu 
mcdonalds held up by many as a model american corporation has 
long been committed to test marketing salads the mcdlt and 
chicken mcnuggets made the grade the hulaburger two slices of 
cheese with a slice of grilled pineapple on a toasted bun did not 
ms oakley noted that mcdonalds tested salads for 10 years 
before introducing them in all of its 8500 us restaurants 
but michael mueller a montgomery securities inc analyst who 
specializes in restaurants says mcdonalds has reasons to press 
ahead with pizza now investors complaints about the companys 
recent us sales growth 
a pattern of progressively weaker domestic sales growth began in 
1988 after peaking at 116 percent in 1987 a selloff of the 
companys stock followed release of second quarter results showing 
domestic sales of 6 billion for the first half of 1990 a 
33percent increase from the first half of 1989 
from their standpoint they have to do something to boost 
dinner sales mueller said this pizza is better than 
nothing 
but is it better than tonys or vitos or sals 
if you like pizza its just not right said elaine lillpop 
of rockport ind its a hurryup job 
she complained that the pepperoni pizza she bought in owensboro 
tasted burned and didnt have enough cheese her 8yearold 
daughter kari said she didnt like it either 
gail thompson of owensboro said she won a free pizza and liked 
it but wouldnt buy another 
i love pizza but i dont particularly like eating it in this 
atmosphere she said between bites of a burger its not fast 
food to me 
that says mueller is the problem pizza doesnt follow the 
rules that helped make mcdonalds the worlds largest restaurant 
chain 
in the past theyve been successful introducing products that 
are cheap easy to eat and come with quick service at the 
drivethrough window said the san franciscobased analyst 
pizza is expensive hard to eat in the car and takes five 
minutes or more to get 
pizza also requires special ovens and is more difficult to make 
and there are lots of competitors already established in the pizza 
market mueller said 
another restaurant analyst roy burry of kidder peabody in new 
york acknowledged the problems but he expressed confidence that 
mcdonalds would find a fastfood pizza that works 
theyve been on track for five or six years with this he 
said it takes a long time to get it right which of course they 
will 
pizza was a logical choice burry said the demand for more 
traditional fast food is not keeping pace with the number of new 
restaurants he said 
pizza is the only fast food product thats growing he said 
its a mammoth market it offers major potential for them 
burry predicted the pizza might be ready for a national rollout 
within two years the test likely will be expanded to more markets 
next year he said 
ms oakley said mcdonalds has not yet decided the products 
fate 
she said pizza is doing very well although the company 
wont discuss sales figures pizza hut the largest pizza chain 
maintains that mcdonalds holds only 2 percent of sales in the 
owensboroevansville market 
evansville workers said sales have been sporadic a cheese pizza 
recently sold there for 499 the deluxe with cheese sausage 
pepperoni green peppers onion tomato and mushrooms sold for 
799 some restaurants sell pizza only after 4 pm some offer 
quarterpie slices for lunch 
the owensboro restaurants lure pizza buyers with glass windows 
that allow customer to watch sausage and pepperoni being spread by 
hand but they dont see dough lovingly kneaded and tossed 
mcdonalds sacrificed fresh dough for frozen in its attempt to 
make pizza a fast food some customers say the dough will be the 
pizzas downfall 
it tastes like cardboard said 16yearold josh hamburg of 
owensboro

thousands of bank workers struck 
wednesday to demand pay raises another sign of continuing unrest 
over government austerity policies 
the strike by the 12000member association of bank employees 
affected all of the countrys 197 bank branches including the 
central bank 
the walkout capmaller job actions by bank 
workers who are demanding job security rule changes and increased 
bank capitalization in additions two weeks of s to higher pay 
the bank union is part of the leftist sandinista front which 
ruled nicaragua for a decade until losing power in an election this 
year the unions led massive nationwide strikes in may and july 
against government economic plans 
last week it withdrew from talks with the government and 
businessmen aimed at reaching agreement on how to tackle the 
countrys economic crisis in which inflation has risen 4000 
percent this year 
sandinista work agreed to all the proposals i made and we agreed to 
the 
proposals that he has made vessey said with thach standing at 
his side 
vessey said technical cooperation for joint investigations was 
agreed to as well as ways to seek information and to return the 
remains of us servicemen 
he said the two sides agreed to new levels of cooperation to 
resolve the fates of the missing in action in southeast asia 
a joint team will be formed to examine the specifics of the new 
forms of cooperation vessey said also participating in the 
discussions was anne mills griffiths head of a group of families 
of missing americans 
thach is the first hanoi official of his rank to visit 
washington since vietnams independence 36 years ago 
a state department announcement had said the subject matter to 
be discussed was to be limited to the powmia issue in response to 
a question thach said there were no american war prisoners in 
government custody 
thachs groundbreaking visit is consistent with a pattern of 
improving relations that dates back to july when the bush 
administration agreed to open discussions with vietnam for the 
first time on resolving the conflict in neighboring cambodia 
earlier usvietnamese contacts had been limited to 
humanitarian issues 
the visit comes at a time of fading american bitterness toward 
hanoi about the loss of more than 55000 us servicemen in the 
vietnam conflict a timecnn poll this past spring showed americans 
support diplomatic relations by a 4832 margin 
thach 66 is a leading proponent of normal ties with the united 
states and has been promoting that goal recently in interviews with 
american reporters 
as the participants in the discussion posed for photographers at 
the armynavy club about 20 vietnamese demonstrators stood outside 
chanting slogans in support of democracy and a market economy for 
vietnam 
thach also planned separate meetings this afternoon with members 
of the foreign relations committees of the senate and the house 
secretary of state james a baker iii met with thach three weeks 
ago in new york and then agreed to facilitate thachs visit to 
washington by waiving the rule that limits vietnamese diplomats to 
a 25mile radius of new york city 
the bakerthach meeting was the first highlevel contact between 
the two countries in 17 years 
the bush administration has linked a normalization of relations 
with vietnam to hanois cooperation in obtaining an accounting of 
the missing americans and in achieving a settlement of the 
cambodian conflict 
ms griffiths said she believes vietnam could do far more in 
helping account for american servicemen than it has 
theres no question but that greater responsiveness would 
resolve hundreds of cases of americans who are missing she says 
the united states has never recognized the communist government 
that assumed power in hanoi in 1954 after the end of french 
colonial rule thach is wellknown to us diplomats as one of the 
principal negotiators of the agreement that led to the withdrawal 
of american forces from vietnam in 1973 
any possibility of a usvietnamese rapprochement in the 
aftermath were dashed when hanois army conquered the usbacked 
government in south vietnam two years after the 1973 agreement 
subsequently vietnam was reunified under hanois rule 
relations with vietnam were further soured when hanoi invaded 
cambodia in late 1978 successive us administrations campaigned 
for years for a vietnamese withdrawal from cambodia 
vietnam said all of its forces were withdrawn a year ago but 
us officials said some have since returned to cambodia 
despite us objections to vietnams role in cambodia both 
sides agree the khmer rouge responsible for the deaths of over 1 
million cambodians in the 1970s should not return to power

van de kamps holland dutch bakery a 
regional baker with a 100item line of goods has closed and laid 
off nearly all its 500 workers union officials and a lawyer for 
the company have announced 
the 75yearold bakery filed for protection from its creditors 
in august under federal bankruptcy law provisions it listed 427 
million in liabilities and 15 million in assets 
david gillan attorney for the company would not elaborate 
and company officials did not return telephone calls for comment 
wednesday 
andrea zinder research director for the united food and 
commercial workers union local 770 which represents some of van de 
kamps sales staff said van de kamp employees told her the bakery 
was shut for good 
she and other union officials said the bakery dismissed most of 
its employees last week 
from what i wgonzalez told brady 
this is a shocking interpretation of a cabinet officers 
responsibility 
i know that you recognize that members of the committee have a 
right and responsibility to seek responses from the administration 
concerning the assumptions beneath the requested amount 
as arduous as this may be for the administration it is not a 
process from which the secretary can be exempted 
the senate banking committee last week endorsed spending 57 
billion more for the bailout 40 billion to cover sampl losses and 
17 billion in reserve funds it acted after receiving a fresh 
letter from brady 
legislators in the house however are being less understanding 
while there has been no talk of subpoenaing brady several 
committee members are threatening to vote against more sampl money 
unless brady appears 
there has been a very disturbing pattern of trying to 
circumvent any kind of congressional oversight of the savings and 
loan bailout said rep joseph kennedy dmass 
if they administration officials run out of money because we 
want to be prudent as to how we provide it then thats up to them 
im not going to vote for any money for an organization where we 
have no idea of how the funds are flowing he said 
the association of community organizations for reform now 
acorn a consumer activist group is urging the committee to block 
the second round of bailout financing unless it takes steps to 
reform the cleanup process 
gonzalez meanwhile is threatening to oppose more financing 
unless the cleanup agency the resolution trust corp ceases its 
practice of protecting virtually all deposits even uninsured 
deposits when a thrift fails

trading 
gold prices inched higher after tumbling more than 25 an ounce

current delivery fetched 36670 a troy ounce up 470 from 
tuesday republic national bank quoted a late bid for bullion of 
36610 an ounce up 210 
much attention focused on the japanese yen which rose 
significantly against the dollar traders said japanese portfolio 
managers are bringing their money home in an effort to support a 
weakening stock market and banks that have suffered declines in 
their capital ratios 
people expect japans ministry of finance to keep yen 
interest rates fairly high which attracts investors said bob 
morrissey senior trader at the bank of bostons office here 
in addition there is the belief that us and japanese 
officials have agreed to an orderly dollar decline and they have 
been tolerating it said stephen flanagan a vice president at 
manufacturers hanover trust co

settled at 12580 japanese yen down from 12805 yen on tuesday

traders said a government report showing a betterthanexpected 
02 percent rise in industrial production during september helped 
put a floor under the dollar even though a 75 percent spurt in 
automobile production masked overall weakness in manufacturing 
the report hinted that there may be less room for the federal 
reserve to east interest rates higher interest rates tend to 
support the dollar by making dollardenominated securities more 
attractive to investors

positions ahead of another slew of economic data the government 
will report thursday on septembers consumer prices and merchandise 
trade figures for august

a super highway of oil has been tapped 
in southeastern wyoming by a drilling technique that could spur an 
oil boom in the region a petroleum expert said wednesday 
the find announced wednesday by union pacific resources co of 
fort worth texas lies in the niobrara formation 18 miles 
northeast of cheyenne 
a 21hour test of the well produced 1462 barrels of crude the 
greatest daily production of any wyoming well according to 
officials 
the company a subsidiary of union pacific corp achieved the 
results by boring into the formation horizontally instead of using 
traditional vertical techniques which would have produced as little 
as 50 barrels per day according to chuck farmer a petroleum 
engineer with the wyoming oil and gas commission 
the find will result in a miniboom he said 
unlike vertical wells that bore straight down and miss pockets 
of oil on either side of the well horizontal wells start 
vertically but the drill bit gradually is turned 90 degrees to 
traverse the rock formation this enables the drill to encounter 
multiple fractures filled with oil that might be missed by a 
vertical drill 
farmer said horizontal drilling appears to be catching on in 
wyoming in 1989 the oil and gas commission received only one

crude oil prices tumbled more than 2 a barrel 
wednesday as the energy futures market though still sensitive to 
developments out of the middle east temporarily ran out of steam 
traders were preoccupied with supplyanddemand concerns 
the november contract for light sweet crude oil slumped 217 to 
3672 a 42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
later contract months also fell sharply 
with no substantive developments from the persian gulf to 
influence trading the market was swayed by reports that crude was 
going unsold in spot markets the reports indicated low demand for 
oil from refineries which are currently retooling to turn out more 
heating oil rather than gasoline for the winter months 
wednesdays drop was something of a surprise after the previous 
session when crude prices rose nearly 1 on expectations that the 
american petroleum institutes weekly report on inventories 
issued after the close of trading tuesday would indicate a 
decline in stockpiles 
tha is exactly what the api reported the trade group said 
domestic crude inventories fell to 3433 million barrels in the 
week ended oct 12 from 3495 million a week earlier with most of 
the decline coming from a major reduction in imports 
the api report sent oil prices higher overseas but when the 
us market opened prices fell 
technical factors also figured into wednesdays session as the 
price of crude fell through psychological points known as support 
levels selling began to accelerate analysts said 
analysts said the market has lost some of its frenzy since the 
november contract for crude was unable to break through the 
41abarrel mark last week 
but they were quick to caution that despite declines like 
wednesdays the market retains most of its bullishness and it is 
still hypersensitive to any negative developments in the persian 
gulf 
it could rocket up if war breaks out said jim fiedler an 
analyst with e d amp f man international futures inc who called 
wednesdays drop a correction to a bull market 
prices for refined products also fell sharply wednesday 
home heating oil for november delivery plunged 575 cents to 
9825 cents a gallon despite the approaching winter weather later 
contract months also fell sharply 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in november skidded 
448 cents to 9340 cents a gallon with subsequent months also 
dropping 
in natural gas trading the november contract closed at 1900 
per 1000 cubic feet down from 1910 on tuesday

465 million gain from unloading its majority interest in two 
italian automotive companies 
net earnings for the third quarter totalled 2398 million or

interest in joint projects said utc spokesman peter kowalchuk 
operating profits from the building systems segment which 
includes its carrier air conditioning and otis elevator 
subsidiaries were down 15 million to 138 million due in part to 
the nations housing slump the company said

for the quarter compared with a 34 million loss in the 1989 
period

major brazilian processers began cutting their prices soon after 
the report including a 25 discount to us customers on monday 
said analyst celeste georkakis of cargill investor services inc

smaller brazilian processers 
we understand that two have filed for bankruptcy and one has 
asked the government for financial help georkakis said

persistent perceptions that the iraqi occupation of kuwait might be

harvest delays and crop damage from a powerful storm system that

unresolved budget talks in washington and plans for a record 2year 
treasury note auction 
the treasurys key 30year issue rose about 1 per 1000 in 
face amount its yield which falls when the price rises eased to 
888 percent from 889 percent late tuesday 
bond strategists said commerce department reports showing 
weakness in the housing industry but rising industrial production 
in september injected some confusion into the market because they 
signaled signs of recession and growth at the same time 
that jerked it around a little bit said micheal casey a 
bond economist at maria ramirez capital consultants inc a new 
york investment concern there were various conflicting stories 
out of the mideast that knocked it around a little bit too 
all financial markets have been fixated on developments in the 
persian gulf since iraq seized kuwait more than two months ago 
provoking a crisis that has nearly doubled the price of oil and 
raised fears of both recession and oilshock inflation in the 
united states which imports half its petroleum 
on tuesday bond prices rose slightly on speculation that 
diplomacy might help resolve the mideast crisis but that thinking 
seemed to disappear wednesday partly on secretary of state james 
a baker iiis remarks that iraqs saddam hussein must fail if 
peace is to succeed 
bond strategists said the persistent inability of congress and 
the bush administration to overcome differences in closing the 
federal budget gap also was creating uncertainty in the market 
president bush has threatened to shut the government down again 
saturday unless congress sends him a budget he can accept without 
emergency legislation federal authority to spend money expires 
that day and would prevent the treasury from borrowing 
the treasurys like a junkie for money casey said thats 
hanging over the market 
william veronda a fixedincome strategist for financial 
programs inc in denver said additional bond market uncertainty 
stemmed from the treasurys plan to auction a record 12 billion in 
2year notes later this month that helped depress some shortterm 
government bond prices he said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds shortterm and 
mediumterm maturities were unchanged to 132 point lower while 
longterm issues were up about 332 point the telerate inc 
financial information service reported 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a

the house on wednesday approved a major civil 
rights bill designed to combat job discrimination and sent it to 
president bush who promised a veto on grounds that it would lead 
to hiring quotas 
i hope that president bush will reconsider the unwise and 
unjustified course he is on sen edward m kennedy dmass 
said following house approval of the bill 273154 
the margin was 12 votes short of the twothirds needed to 
override a veto and pass the bill over the presidents objections 
thirtyfour republicans and 239 democrats voted for the bill while 
15 democrats and 139 republicans were opposed 
despite months of efforts for forge a compromise civil rights 
forces succeeded in gaining just one vote beyond their total on 
aug 3 when the house passed an earlier version 272154 
were somewhat disappointed because we had hoped that the 
additional compromises that were made since the vote last time 
would have picked up some votes said william taylor a longtime 
washington civil rights advocate 
the senate on tuesday approved the bill but also fell short of 
the support needed to override a veto somber civil rights forces 
planned a final campaign to persuade bush to relent and sign the 
bill 
give us these measly crumbs from the table rep craig 
washington dtexas said as the house debated the measure which 
had been nine months in the making and softened repeatedly in 
efforts to woo bushs support 
the bill represents the civil rights movements top priority on 
capitol hill this year it would overturn six decisions on job 
discrimination that created a furor when the supreme court handed 
them down last year 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages in extreme discrimination cases 
the greatest controversy however came over complex changes in 
rules on how job discrimination cases are decided they would make 
it easier for minorities filing suit to win and harder for 
employers to defend themselves 
president bush said in a letter delivered to capitol hill on 
tuesday that the changes would have the effect of forcing 
businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and promotion he said that 
if the bill reached his desk he would be compelled to veto it 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
morning that bush planned to veto the measure and send it back to 
lawmakers with an alternative version attached civil rights 
leaders however have been saying the chances of passing an 
alternative this year are virtually nil 
in recent months they had been holding out hope that bush would 
relent and sign the bill after weighing tuesdays missive from the 
president however civil rights leaders sharpened their rhetoric 
his announced intention to veto the civil rights act of 1990 
shows that on issues of race and sex discrimination george bush is 
a ronald reagan in sheeps clothing said ralph neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
while his style and rhetoric may differ his substantive civil 
rights policies are just as deadly to those who are victims of job 
discrimination neas said indeed with respect to key parts of 
the civil rights act of 1990 president bushs positions are even 
more extreme than ronald reagans 
regrettably president bush has capitulated to the right 
wing he said 
there is nothing in the bill that would require employers to 
hire by quota in fact the measure contains a disclaimer 
specifically saying that it would not encourage the use of 
quotas 
business groups and bush administration officials say however 
that the bill would make employers so vulnerable to discrimination 
suits that they would turn to quotas to provide themselves with a 
readymade defense in case they were taken to court 
civil rights forces tried in vain for months to dispel this 
notion saying the measure would do no more than restore the law to 
what it was before last years decision in a case called wards cove 
versus atonio involving employment practices at a salmon cannery 
in alaska 
supporters also said strong support for a civil rights bill was 
needed to show congressional disapproval of an upsurge in acts of 
bigotry by neonazi groups and others they cited a surprising 
showing in recent louisiana primary voting for former ku klux klan 
leader david duke 
david duke was not a fluke rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo said
