the merce cunningham dance company celebrating 
its 35th anniversary with its longest new york engagement four 
weeks presented a premiere by cunningham on wednesday night 
the dance at the joyce theater for 11 dancers is titled 
eleven the music by robert ashley his first for the company 
is titled problems in the flying saucer the dance does not act 
that out 
as always with cunningham the dancers are proficient and 
fluidly graceful they shift weight and hold poses without 
stiffness a viewer may not know why one set of moves follows 
another but the dancers are entirely purposeful in performing them 
cunningham choreographs to use the entire stage giving his 
dancers the look of freedom a couple dancing together may not 
touch often but they stay in each others general area circles are 
negotiated slowly or spun with arms swinging broadly often one leg 
is extended while a dancers body turns profile then turns again 
to face the audience 
once a woman dancers enters walking with bent knees its 
amusing because its so different from the expansive movements that 
other dancers on stage at that moment are doing 
the music is two men talking michael pugliese with a 
french accent and takehisa kosugi in a near monotone kosugi 
composed the music for the other two dances on the evenings 
program doubles and grange eve cunningham danced in 
grange eve 
pugliese speaks first saying a sentence fragment like there 
is no sound or off in the daytime before he finishes a 
phrase kosugi comes in on top of it saying something like the 
south of france even if one listens only to one speaker phrases 
dont add up to sentences and not all words can be understood 
there are many pauses between sets of phrases since cunningham 
choreographs without music anyway the dance flows on 
program notes explain that ashleys work is an excerpt from a 
screenplay for an opera odalisque in which a lieutenant in a 
flying saucer explains to his captain something about a musician 
they have on board the cunningham dance foundation commissioned 
this arrangement and instructions for performance 
the present season which ends march 27 also includes the new 
york premiere of carousal done last summer at the jacobs 
pillow dance festival a revival of the 1968 rainforest and 
septet which cunningham created in 1953 his companys first 
year septet is danced to satie music it was revived last year 
after a 23year absence from the repertory

de janeiro and belo horizonte brazil from april 8 through 15

many prominent panamanians say the 
nations entire system needs changing not just the leader and 
even if gen manuel antonio noriega goes the united states may be 
backing the wrong replacement 
eric arturo delvalle the ousted president washington supports 
tried to dismiss noriega on feb 25 as commander of the panama 
defense forces noriega arranged for the legislature to dismiss 
delvalle instead and the political and economic crisis has 
deepened since 
the united states is mistaken in putting so much behind 
delvalle said luis moreno former manager of chase manhattan 
banks local operations and until january 1987 a member of the 
government banking commission moreno an independent met 
regularly with the president and cabinet ministers 
delvalle and his people are spent he said noriega is 
laughing at this rallying behind delvalle saying this guy cant 
bring me down 
the reagan administration continues to recognize delvalle now 
in hiding in panama as the countrys legitimate leader and is is 
applying economic pressure in an effort to get him back in office 
noriega was indicted in florida last month on narcotics and 
moneylaundering charges which he denies and the reagan 
administration portrays him as little more than a gangster 
washington has indicated the economic heat will end if he steps 
down or is removed 
roderick esquivel who was delvalles vice president and was 
removed with him said the object is not to change the face on 
the regime but to dismantle an entire corrupt and repressive 
apparatus of state esquivel who also is in hiding made the 
comment during an interview at a safehouse 
a former top official who left the government in a dispute with 
noriega said in order to achieve democracy it is the structure 
that has to be broken not mr noriega 
the colonels and majors are involved in the same businesses he 
noriega is involved in that implies a great degree of 
solidarity 
the defense forces control the executive and legislative 
branches of government through the two political parties linked to 
them and all judges are political appointees including the supreme 
court justices 
not only does the military control the three branches of 
government but it also controls the fourth estate the media 
said the former official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
noriega has closed all opposition media three newspapers two 
radio stations and a television channel 
many people ask why delvalle who had followed noriegas ordered 
until the february revolt is seen as the man to change things 
delvalle is important in that he changed the sense of 
hemispheric support for the government with his attempt to depose 
noriega but he has always been on the sidelines said roberto 
brenes a leader of the national civic crusade 
the crusade an alliance of about 200 business professional 
labor and political organizations has led opposition to noriega 
since it was formed last june 
on monday it joined opposition parties in calling for a 
government of national reconciliation and transition the document 
they issued did not say delvalle would head such a government but 
recognized him as he who exercises the office of president 
questions about what will and should happen next also dominate 
the daily lives of average citizens in this country which has the 
panama canal as an integral part of its economy and uses us 
dollar as its national currency 
miguel correa a truck driver noted that delvalle like others 
of noriegas recent critics had been involved in his regime 
why the sudden change of heart when they were all part of the 
same dirty business he said 
among noriegas accusers hare retired gen ruben paredes his 
predecessor as defense forces commander jose blandon a former top 
adviser and retired col roberto diaz herrera noriegas former 
chief of staff 
the joint statement by the crusade and the opposition parties 
said delvalle by his actions committed himself to the changes 
necessary for establishment of a legitimate democracy 
this caution came from the former high official the more time 
that passes the less viable becomes the delvalle solution

in this city jesse jackson is the wellknown 
social activist a canny player in the back rooms of a worldclass 
political hotbed 
in greenville sc hes the hometown celebrity who hasnt 
forgotten his roots 
jackson hopes to cash in on both images and turn hometown 
sentiment into votes in two contests in the next week 
south carolina holds democratic caucuses on saturday the 
illinois primary is tuesday 
arriving under chilly gray skies back in chicago on wednesday 
jackson was triumphant telling a rally of factory workers we get 
stronger every day 
here he founded the social action organization people united to 
serve humanity here he makes his home in a large comfortable 
house on a pleasant residential street with his wife jacqueline 
and five children 
halfway across the nation is jacksons other hometown it was 
greenville where jackson stopped last week as he launched his final 
swing through the south on the road to the critical super tuesday 
contests 
jackson came in first in the popular vote in those primaries and 
caucuses and second to massachusetts gov michael dukakis in the 
delegate count 
in greenville they remember jackson as the youngster who went 
off to be a college football quarterback then launched a career as 
a minister and civil rights activist who followed dr martin luther 
king jr 
jackson saw familiar faces when his motorcade pulled up to the 
springfield baptist church last week to address a convention of 
ministers it was this church he told them that he attended as a 
boy while his mother sang in the choir 
greenville a mediumsized city set among rolling hills with a 
rural atmosphere was a major textile center in those days but it 
fell on hard times as the mills began to close jackson says 
jackson took reporters to the projects where he lived as a boy 
he went into his old apartment a spartan brick unit with plastic 
flowers on display the home today of a single mother of two who 
earns minimum wage putting pleats on skirts 
the projects residents came out to shake jacksons hand as he 
strolled through the streets secret service agents and tv cameras 
in tow 
today jacksons mother lives in a comfortable splitlevel home 
walls covered with tastefully framed photo layouts depicting 
jacksons life in a far more affluent neighborhood of greenville 
there a group of friends and family members celebrated 
jacksons night at home with a feast of sweet potatoes corn bread 
turkey dressing cobblers and other home cooking the likes of 
which is seldom seen on jacksons breakneck campaign 
the next morning there was more home cooking biscuits and 
grits this time with white farmers on a dairy farm near town 
south carolina farmers told jackson how the nations farm policy 
has brought them hardship but they were noncommittal about whether 
they would vote for him 
there is no such reticence when jackson gets home to chicago a 
big industrial city whose people hurry along skyscraperlined 
sidewalks bundled up against the icy blasts that whistle along the 
streets and beneath the elevated rail cars 
here the crowds that come to see him are his fans 
at the general electric plant rally the crowd knew what they 
wanted the candidate to do 
jesse help us save our jobs their signs read 
ive been working here 23 years said mack fundes a truck 
driver for ges hotpoint refrigerator plant that is scheduled to 
close in a couple of years 
nothing has changed here its time for change i believe 
jesse would make a change he said

richard gephardt grimaced a bit as he 
stood in a pole barn on a soggy afternoon pondering a question 
from the tiny knot of democrats 
the question was do you really think you can beat jesse 
jackson and al gore here 
after a pause gephardt said were going to try very hard 
throughout wednesday the day after his disastrous super tuesday 
performance gephardt doggedly trudged across raindrenched south 
carolina trying to explain his showing and pleading with democrats 
to give him a boost in saturdays caucuses 
unless youre willing to stand up for change its not going 
to happen gephardt said if you will stand with me on 
saturday well change those facts of life 
only a month ago gephardt was riding high after a win in the 
iowa caucuses from there he went on to a secondplace finish in 
new hampshire and won south dakotas primary a week later 
but suddenly he is fighting to keep his campaign alive 
the difficulty facing gephardt was summarized at the jim harwell 
farm just outside this eastern south carolina town 
as the recorded strains of country singer willie nelson wailed 
mournfully in the background gephardt mingled with a couple of 
dozen party activists in what was billed as a farm rally for him to 
push some basic campaign themes he hopes will sway farmers in this 
heavily rural state 
gephardt insisted throughout the day that his problem during the 
20state round of voting earlier in the week was the sheer size of 
the event he said it prevented him from telling his story leaving 
him victorious only in his home state 
when i get my message out to the voters i win gephardt 
said they didnt hear what i had to say that was the problem 
but when gephardt sounded his familiar toughtalking trade 
themes they got a lukewarm response 
that was partly because the audience was tiny only a couple of 
dozen people showed up at the farm at an event earlier in the day 
at a threatened textile plant his audience was composed almost 
entirely of elementaryschool students bused in for the occasion 
an evening rally in greenville found the room half empty 
thats the price gephardt paid for his showing on the campaign 
seasons biggest event as attention focuses on other candidates 
like gore jackson and massachusetts gov michael dukakis who have 
reaped big harvests of delegates 
we did not have a good outcome yesterday gephardt said in a 
significant understatement 
but he spent a lot of his time insisting hes in the race for 
the long haul 
the race is on gephardt said im not where id like to 
be but i think i have ample opportunity to make up lost ground and 
get back in the middle of this race and win 
gephardt and his aides conceded their campaign could badly use a 
boost and they busily drew up scenarios for keeping the effort 
alive 
its going to be tough its an uphill battle said deputy 
campaign manager joe trippi but thats what were going to try 
to do 
throughout the super tuesday campaign gephardt was outspent by 
both gore and dukakis and campaign consultant bob shrum conceded 
that a fourthplace showing wont make raising money any easier 
it wont be as easy to raise money but well raise money 
shrum said were not penniless 
gephardt insisted his financial picture is not all that bleak 
his debts are modest he says and more federal matching funds are 
on the way 
we didnt borrow as others did to run on super tuesday 
gephardt said maybe in retrospect we should have 
but gephardt faces big hurdles if hes to regain momentum 
south carolina is where jackson was born and gephardt aide 
concede that he best they can hope for saturday is a secondplace 
finish 
the gephardt campaign has been downplaying next weeks illinois 
primary saying results will be muddled by homestate sen paul 
simons presence on the ballot 
that leaves gephardt with a long stretch before hes likely to 
get any positive campaign news 
hes pinning his hopes on michigan which holds caucuses march 
26 as a key bluecollar state where he hopes his tough trade talk 
will sell 
it also drastically raises the stakes for gephardt 
were going to do well in michigan he said i need to do 
well in michigan

playboy publisher hugh hefner standing 
arminarm with his new girlfriend announced a countersuit against 
his exlover alleging she was unfaithful and her 35 million 
palimony lawsuit was a publicity stunt 
but model carrie leighs attorney says her action was brought to 
stop hefner from using and discarding young women 
the 61yearold hefner who filed the 1 million cross complaint 
wednesday said ms leigh filed her lawsuit to advance her own 
career and that of her lawyer marvin mitchelson 
youre talking about the criminal misuse of the judicial 
system hefner told reporters as he stood with his new 
girlfriend 24yearold kimberley conrad at the playboy mansion 
i want to put a stop to that 
ms leigh could not be reached for comment because her phone 
number is unlisted 
mitchelson on vacation in paris said from his hotel 
this is my 32nd year as a lawyer and ive never filed a 
lawsuit in my life that didnt have merit 
the palimony suit was really developed to remedy situations 
involving people like hugh hefner he continued he has made a 
lifelong practice of getting involved with teenage girls living 
with them for a few years and then discarding them 
ms leighs suit filed last month claims hefner reneged on 
promises to marry her father her child and support her 
hefners attorney anthony glassman said he filed two legal 
actions wednesday in superior court 
one was an answer to ms leighs palimony suit in which the 
founder of playboy magazine denied his former girlfriends 
allegations 
the second was the cross complaint seeking 1 million plus court 
costs attorney fees and an amount of punitive damages to be 
determined by the court 
glassman said the 1 million represents the value of cash 
jewelry furs and other gifts hefner gave to ms leigh now 24 
while the two were together from april 1983 to january 
hefners complaint also accuses ms leigh of fraudulently 
telling hefner she loved him and was faithful to him 
on repeated occasions ms leigh was sexually unfaithful to 
him glassman told reporters 
hefner said he bears no animosity toward ms leigh but believes 
now that she had planned for years to eventually sue him for 
palimony 
i think what is happening now is something that was in her 
mind from the beginning he said 
he added that friends relatives and business associates tried 
to warn him about her but he didnt listen to them 
i just saw what i wanted to see he said 
hefner meanwhile said he has not asked ms conrad to sign any 
legal papers absolving him of financial responsibility should their 
relationship eventually disolve 
he said he met the tall blonde model playboy magazines 
january playmate of the month when she came to the mansion last 
may to pose he said the two didnt become involved until after ms 
leigh left the mansion 
ms conrad declined comment on ms leigh 
im just here to support hef and i came after carrie leigh 
so i really have no comment she said

antiapartheid banners adorn the 
halls at the university of the western cape and the main plaza is 
called freedom square an exile once jailed for terrorism is 
receiving an honorary degree this week 
western cape is the most radical university in south africa its 
chief administrator professor jakes gerwel said when installed as 
rector last year that he plans to preside over an intellectual 
home for the left 
the militance of students and staff contrasts sharply with the 
governments intent in 1960 when it established a college near 
cape town for mixedrace students as part of its segregated 
education system jg miering a white professor who headed the 
school in the 1960s said the white guardian was obliged to 
provide these facilities for his colored mixedrace ward 
the university remains predominantly mixedrace but gerwel is 
determined to increase black enrollment beyond the current 13 
percent his administration is openly committed to preparing 
students for a postapartheid south africa led by the nowvoteless 
black majority 
we are a political thorn in their sides gerwel said of the 
government the establishment doesnt know how to deal with us 
a case in point is the universitys decision to award an 
honorary degree friday to breyten breytenbach a white poet who 
left south africa in 1982 after serving seven years in prison for 
terrorism the government denied breytenbach a visa and a relative 
is to accept the award on his behalf 
at the same graduation ceremony one of the main speakers will 
be cyril ramaphosa general secretary of the militant black 
national union of mineworkers 
last month the universitys governing council elected anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu as chancellor tutu winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize for his antiapartheid campaigning is the first 
black chosen for the honorary post 
gerwel who as professor of afrikaans literature was a leading 
faculty activist is the second mixedrace rector the first 
richard van der ross led from 197587 and is credited with 
establishing the schools antiapartheid orientation 
most of south africas 3 million mixedrace people live in the 
cape town region the universitys enrollment has soared from 6128 
in 1984 to 11500 this year and multiple construction projects 
cant keep pace with the need for more facilities 
sometimes we cannot teach our students because theres no 
place to put them said owen van den bergh a white who is dean 
of education we have to hope they dont come to class 
the government has cut subsidies to all universities by about 25 
percent this year and adopted regulations to allow further cuts at 
schools that fail to curb campus protest the university of the 
western cape and the predominantly white university of cape town 
successfully challenged the regulations in court but gerwel 
expects the government to try other tactics to tame his school 
one of gerwels priorities is to expand the universitys ties 
with the antiapartheid movement the campus often serves as a 
venue for meetings of militant organizations 
going to uwc is considered by students to be part of the 
political struggle said di bishop vice president of the black 
sash civil rights organization and a university sociology 
researcher youre not going off to an ivory tower for a couple 
of years 
security forces have entered the campus several times in recent 
years to break up protests with tear gas and whips there is 
animosity among some students toward remaining conservative 
professors 
there also is conflict over language some of the 600 teachers 
lecture in english and others in afrikaans the language that many 
mixedrace people have inherited from the mainly dutchdescended 
whites who run the government 
van den bergh forsees increasing tension as black enrollment 
rises he also sees internal pressures building up in individual 
students 
there are a lot who say the right things politically but are 
fundamentally conservative he said they are worried about 
getting a job getting a house 
gerwel said the university could arm itself against 
government pressure by adding more professional schools it now 
offers graduate degrees in law pharmacy and dentistry but he also 
wants the curriculum to accommodate those who have been excluded 
from power and privilege 
in a changed south africa its not going to be a first world 
hightech society he said what is this new south africa we 
are working for were trying to find out the englishlanguage 
universities are geared to capitalism we research alternatives 
although the government provides most of their funds the 
university and the 10 predominantly white universities have almost 
total control of curriculum and campus policies the black 
universities are tightly controlled by the government and 
cooperative administrators and student protests at these schools 
has been repressed 
gerwel said his job keeps one awake at night 
but i wouldnt want to be in any other position were at the 
cutting edge of adjusting to a blackled society

despite prospects for an economic boom the 
next few years the northern industrial states face a creeping 
erosion of their political clout and claim on federal dollars a 
demographic bust 
a study by the northeastmidwest institute a public policy 
group with ties to the regions members of congress says the 
industrial north is enjoying bigger income gains but has far less 
population growth than the sunbelt 
the population of the 18 northern states stretching from 
minnesota to new england will grow by 38 percent through the 
1990s only about half the national average according to the study 
titled the state of the region and released wednesday 
in recent years the south and west have drawn industries and 
jobs from the north even though the northeasts overall economy 
has rebounded the region will not be able to keep up with the 
competing areas population growth the study said it estimated 
that the population of the west and south will grow 10 percent in 
the next decade 
for the northeast the lagging population growth will translate 
into fewer representatives in the house and fewer federal dollars 
from programs based on the number of people in a state or area the 
study said 
political influence from the selection of the president in 
the electoral college to appropriation fights in the house of 
representatives will shift further to the south and west the 
study said 
the northeast could lose 14 house seats after the 1990 census 
the report said the region lost 15 seats after the 1980 census 
for a total projected loss in representation of 13 percent in the 
1970s and 1980s the study said 
the lagging population gains in the northeast and midwest result 
both from lower birth rates and migration to southern and western 
states the study said 
the shortterm economic outlook for the entire region is 
positive the study said the northeast shared in the national 
return to prosperity from 1983 to late 1986 with new england 
benefiting the most 
unemployment has dropped below the national average in parts of 
the region but the northeast is unlikely to regain many of the 13 
million manufacturing jobs lost between 1980 and 1986 the study 
said the population that remains however is enjoying faster per 
capita income growth than that of southerners and westerners 
the south and west for the first time topped the northeast and 
midwest in manufacturing employment in 1986 the sunbelt had 95 
million employees on manufacturing payrolls compared with 94 
million in the northeast and midwest 
other points made by the study were 
the northeast and midwest invested more in public school 
education than did other regions 
the trend toward an older population was more evident in the 
northeast and midwest than in the rest of the country 
northeast states covered by the report were connecticut 
delaware illinois indiana iowa maine maryland massachusetts 
michigan minnesota new hampshire new jersey new york ohio 
pennsylvania rhode island vermont and wisconsin 
the privately funded northeastmidwest institute was formed in 
1977 at the request of members of the house and senate from the 
region the study also was sponsored by two legislative groups the 
northeastmidwest congressional coalition and the northeastmidwest 
senate coalition

international travelers arriving at some major 
us airports this summer will be greeted by agriculture department 
inspectors operating xray machines to see if their baggage harbors 
illegal food or plants 
the xrays in addition to sharpnosed canine sniffers will be 
used to check arrivals at 11 us international airports for 
illegal sausages mangoes and other contraband 
imported meats can carry exotic diseases that could devastate 
american livestock james w glosser head of the departments 
animal and plant health inspection service said wednesday 
fruits and vegetable coming into the country can carry pests that 
could seriously damage american crops 
agency inspectors have used xray equipment in puerto rico and 
hawaii for departures for several years with interceptions of 
prohibited agricultural items doubling he said 
the new systems for arrivals were recently installed at 
international airports in miami honolulu san juan puerto rico 
houston and chicago 
additional equipment soon will be installed at international 
airports in atlanta new york washington boston los angeles and 
san francisco 
the usda agency also is installing large signs at the 11 
airports telling travelers that xrays are being used to check 
their baggage 
although most people willingly declare their agricultural 
products we do come across some intentional violators glosser 
said thats only natural considering that we encountered an 
estimated 43 million air travelers in 1987 some ignore the 
regulations and others are not even aware of them despite all our 
information efforts 
glosser said the agency uses several methods to find smuggled 
agricultural items including trained beagles to sniff out the 
errant braunschweiger here the occasional mango or two there 
finally we rely on the deterrent effect of penalties he 
said we fine violators 25 to 50 payable on the spot we 
currently collect about 30000 per month and we have collected 
nearly 18 million since 1984 fines are deposited in the us 
treasury 
glosser said the travel industry plays an important role in 
helping educate the traveling public including the distribution of 
booklets about agricultural items that may be brought into the 
united states 
a brochure also can be obtained by writing travelers tips

an absorbent called super slurper invented in 
the 1970s is helping tiny worms kill destructive root weevils that 
threaten citrus trees according to an agriculture department 
scientist 
william j schroeder an entomolgist in the departments 
agricultural research service said wednesday the super slurper 
keeps soil moist so that the microscopic worms or nematodes can 
survive and kill weevils that chew the tree roots 
in tests 60 percent of the weevils were killed compared with 
only 25 percent without the help of the worms schroeder said that 
weevils can kill up to 30 percent of the trees in a grove if not 
controlled 
the nematodes havent been used before as a natural weevil 
control because they die quickly if soil dries out schroeder said 
other agency scientists are looking into the use of super 
slurper and nematodes to see if they can control pests of corn and 
vegetables 
agency scientists in peoria ill invented the cornstarchbased 
super slurper 14 years ago it has been successfully used in dozens 
of commercial products including body powder medical dressings 
and many other items 
schroeder who works at the departments horticultural research 
laboratory in orlando fla said he thought of super slurper in 
1985 when he observed nematodes dying in dry soil 
i realized that in order to use this biological control 
nematodes we would have to keep the soil moist schroeder said 
with its ability to hold up to 2000 times its own weight in 
water superslurper provided the answer schroeder said 
companies could massrear nematodes and package billions of 
them alive for sale to growers who then could mix the worms with 
super slurper for application on tree roots before planting he 
said 
for citrus groves already inhabited by the beneficial nematodes 
schroeder said he is looking into the possibility of injecting 
super slurper into the soil with a nozzle 
the tiny worms which survive as long as the soil is kept moist 
penetrate the weevils and release lethal bacteria which dont harm 
plants or other organisms schroeder said

a man accused of trying to sexually 
assault miss usa pageant cohost tracy scoggins contends she 
invited him to her room a claim the actress dismissed as absurd 
tracy scoggins has turned some very serious charges into a 
very cheap publicity stunt in a desperate attempt to benefit her 
sagging career said attorney jose montes jr who is 
representing the man 
montes said tuesday that miss scoggins met his client pedro 
concepcion padilla in traffic on interstate 10 on feb 25 and

primetime soap opera the colbys told police padilla attacked 
her that day in a hotel elevator

leave it to ronald reagan to find something 
good to say about budget deficits 
for decades reagan has denounced the bigspending crowd in 
washington that he said was dooming future generations to a life of 
debt and penury 
in his seven years in office he has promised repeatedly to do 
something about it and blamed democrats in congress for the 
deficits that nevertheless flourished 
in a recent interview with lou cannon of the washington post 
however reagan was reminded of the sizable deficit he will leave 
behind and was asked 
do you think that this is going to have a negative consequence 
on the next generations is this going to be a real burden for the 
country 
reagans reply 
its a burden theres no question about that but not the 
disaster some people proclaim one of the major factors in our 
budget right now is the interest but who gets that interest and 
you find out then that a great many institutions universities 
educational institutions of all kinds that part of their endowment 
are government bonds and so a lot of that interest is going to 
them and to individual americans as part of their 
savings instead of putting it in the bank or something 
so instead of it being something thats just disappearing 
down a rat hole its a kind of a redistribution of national 
wealth in that these institutions and so forth are getting this 
interest from the government now maybe some of them would have to 
be getting straight grants from the government if they were not 
getting that interest so no i dont think its a disaster 
reagan still saying that he was disappointed that we havent 
been able to do better and that the congress added to that 
budget conceded that his position was really a reversal of 
roles for him 
it sure is 
as the president noted way back before i ever thought i would 
be governor when i was just out making speeches on the 
mashedpotato circuit about things that i thought should be changed 
i was complaining about the fact that for almost 60 years now 
with only eight singleyear exceptions this country has been 
running a deficit 
it still is running a deficit but now reagan calls it a 
redistribution of wealth 
as the president would say it reminds one of a story in fact 
one of reagans favorite stories 
the story is about two boys one a pessimist and one an 
optimist who are taken to a psychiatrist he puts the pessimist in 
a room full of shiny new toys and finds him crying because hes 
afraid the toys might break the optimistic child is put in a room 
with piles of horse manure and is found joyfully exclaiming i 
know theres a pony in here someplace 
its the same way with deficits ronald reagan always knew there 
was a pony in there someplace

the man known as the godfather of east 
european dissidents says the reforms of mikhail s gorbachev and 
the promised soviet withdrawal from afghanistan are nudging other 
warsaw pact nations toward greater independence from the kremlin 
eastern european nations will insist on trying to find ways 
toward greater autonomy from the soviet union said milovan 
djilas whose native yugoslavia parted with moscow in 1948 
similar nationalistic impulses also are being expressed in the 
nonrussian republics of the soviet union such as armenia 
azerbaijan and the baltic states where the kremlin has been 
cracking down on demonstrations 
in the west said djilas people should have hope but not 
illusions should be strong but not unreasonable in reacting to 
gorbachevs foreign and domestic policy initiatives 
djilas now 77 began his dissidence in 1953 a year later quit 
his posts as yugoslavian vice president and member of the communist 
party politburo and was imprisoned from 195661 by yugoslavias 
thenpresident josef broz tito 
from prison he wrote his best known work the new class in 
which he argued that communist leaders in the soviet union and 
throughout eastern europe had created a system in which power 
wealth and privilege were as abused as in the governments they 
replaced his writings made him an icon in the west and became a 
model for dissidents throughout the communist world 
djilas who addressed the heritage foundation last week and 
later was interviewed by the associated press last visited the 
united states in 1968 the government of yugoslavia took away his 
passport in 1970 and did not restore it until 18 months ago 
i am not a good boy he said grinning impishly despite his 
advanced age and a nagging heart condition the yugoslavian 
government he said is not very happy about my speaking but 
apparently has given up its futile efforts to silence him 
western attention to his predicament made life easier he said 
i think the west and america saved me he said certainly 
my fate would have been much worse if public opinion had not been 
aroused on my behalf 
djilas had warm words for gorbachev whose reforms he said were 
an attempt to end the repressive system imposed on the soviet union 
and eastern europe by soviet dictator josef stalin 
even if kremlin conservatives topple gorbachev djilas 
predicted the process will continue 
gorbachev is a man in the middle of the party between the 
hardliners and more radical elements like boris yeltsin who 
was forced to quit his post as the communist party first secretary 
for the city of moscow because he criticized gorbachev for going 
too slow 
the reforms and the promised soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan will strengthen democratic elements in the soviet 
union and encourage other warsaw pact nations in their own 
economic and political experiments said djilas 
east european leaders are trying to avoid a confrontation with 
moscow while seeking greater independence he said there is no 
sign of an uprising 
yugoslavia is farthest along in this crisis of communism 
retaining a communist government while allowing market forces to 
play a powerful role in the economy he said 
the crisis is also acute in poland where the army stepped in to 
preserve communist rule in 1981 and where the economy is mixed 
between state and private ownership said djilas 
we cannot exclude that poland would develop a different 
noncommunist social system and still remain within the warsaw 
pact and thus pose no military threat to the kremlin said djilas

the nuclear regulatory commission has fined 
the owner of the north anna nuclear power plant 100000 after 
operators failed to respond promptly to a equipment malfunction 
officials said wednesday 
monitoring instruments on two pipes carrying steam to the 
plants generators malfunctioned and operators did not respond for 
about 10 hours according to the nrc which imposed the penalty 
against virginia power co 
under nrc rules operators must take action within an hour 
the incident which occurred nov 4 when the utility was 
restarting north anna unit 2 after refueling caused no injuries or 
release of radiation 
the nrc said that the violation involving part of a nonnuclear 
system did not pose a direct safety hazard 
however the instruments provide information necessary to 
reactor safety and if steam is not moving correctly to generators 
the nuclear systems could overheat utility and nrc officials said 
the instruments could also be used in responding to steamline 
ruptures in 1986 at virginia powers surry nuclear plnat four 
workers were killed by scalding steam and water from a failed pipe 
the commission said because similar incidents occurred 
previously at north anna the fine was doubled from 50000 the 
typical amount for such violations 
the utility said it would not contest the fine and it disputed 
only the nrcs contention that previous violations were similar 
virginia power has taken action to ensure a violation will not 
happen again including improved training of operators said 
utility spokesman james e mcdonald jr no workers were dismissed 
or disciplined he said 
the north anna nuclear unit has three main steam lines and each 
has two of the instruments in the november incident one 
instrument failed on each of two lines 
mcdonald said operators initially were unaware the instruments 
were malfunctioning 
virginia power has been fined 13 times since it began operating 
nuclear plants in 1972

for a brief moment president reagan was 
transported back in time hurling a pigskin to a wide receiver at 
a sentimental celebration of notre dames knute rockne and his own 
days as a hollywood star 
the gipper returned to the notre dame campus wednesday to 
pay tribute to the late football legend and dedicate a 22cent 
stamp issued in honor of the coachs 100th birthday 
it was a nostalgic trip into the past for ronald reagan the 
onetime actor sports announcer and college football player who 
clearly reveled in the crowds friendly applause 
the notre dame gathering of students and faculty including 
many wearing roman collars roared approval as they were treated 
to clips from reagans 1940 film portrayal of notre dame football 
star george gipp in knute rockne all american 
the film showed the freshfaced reagan playing gipp as he 
playfully kicked footballs high above the playing field while pat 
obrien playing rockne persuades him to join the team 
another clip showed obrien as rockne giving a pep talk to his 
players at halftime of a 1928 game against army with both sides 
scoreless gipp had died eight years earlier but the coach tells 
his charges that on his deathbed the young athlete said some 
time when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the 
boys tell them to go out there with all they got and win just one 
for the gipper 
army went ahead in the third quarter 60 but notre dame went 
on to win the game 126 army was one yard from the tying 
touchdown as time ran out 
reagans supporters adopted the win one phrase during his 
presidency to help garner support for his programs and the 
nickname the gipper has since stuck 
at the end of his speech the filledtocapacity crowd was 
silent as reagan tried to repeat the lines from gipps deathbed 
scene few however noticed that reagan flubbed the line and 
instead of saying gipper actually pronounced it gippet 
since his listeners erupted in a joyful cheer at the sentimental 
moment 
handed a football reagan hurled it towards members of the notre 
dame football team seated strategically near the podium 
aiming at one young man who held his arms high reagan heaved 
the pigskin directly it turned out at heisman trophy winner tim 
brown again the crowd roared approval 
reagan had told his audience that the role of gipp was a young 
actors dream but that playing in a film about rockne was more 
than that to him 
i know that to many of you today rockne is a revered name a 
symbol of greatness and yes a face on a postage stamp he said 
but my generation well we actually knew the legend as it 
happened we saw it unfold and we felt it was saying something 
important about us as a people and a nation the 77yearold 
president said 
most of all the rockne legend meant this that on or off 
the field it is faith that makes the difference it is faith that 
makes great things happen 
rockne a graduate of the roman catholic college was its head 
football coach from 1918 to 1931 he compiled a record of 108 
victories 12 losses and five ties during his tenure the fighting 
irish were undefeated in five seasons and won six national 
championships 
the white house has worked for years to produce pictureperfect 
events to frame the president as the nations leader but few 
could have been as nostalgic 
he loved it said agriculture secretary richard lyng a 1940 
notre dame graduate who traveled with reagan aboard air force one 
the cabinet secretary said reagan particularly enjoyed tossing 
the football 
the president threw a perfect strike lyng added with a 
laugh

the democratic partys losing presidential 
candidates have found one bright spot in the darkness of their 
defeat the odds are that nobody will be able to claim victory by 
the time the primaries are over in june 
the big winners in this weeks round of primaries and caucuses 
dismiss that as wishful thinking 
if you get within a decent distance youre not going to be 
stopped said rick hutcheson who oversees delegate selection for 
tennessee sen albert gore jrs campaign i dont think theres 
any doubt in the world that there are plenty of delegates out there 
for a firstballot nominee to develop 
true there are enough delegates yet to be allotted that a clear 
winner could emerge but the odds certainly are growing longer that 
any candidate can come up with the magic number needed to win on 
the first ballot at the democratic convention in atlanta 
mathematically and politically this process is in gridlock 
said terry michael spokesman for illinois sen paul simon who 
suffered a shutout in tuesdays round of primaries and caucuses 
hutcheson who worked in former president jimmy carters 1976 
presidential campaign said the thencandidate carter wound up the 
primary season with about 85 percent of the delegates he needed to 
win the democratic presidential nomination the remaining delegates 
gravitated toward a winner he said 
i think that same scenario will develop here hutcheson said 
simon who held just 355 delegates both before and after 
tuesdays balloting is banking on nobody being able to gain the 
2082 delegates needed to win the democratic presidential 
nomination when the primaries conclude on june 7 with california 
and new jersey two of the largest states with a total of 423 
delegates at stake 
the person or persons with the greatest potential to negotiate 
his way to a firstballot victory will be the candidate who is 
hottest at the end michael said 
the democrats have yet to allocate 2524 of their national 
convention delegates and another 25865 delegates list themselves 
as uncommitted thus the available pool of delegates to be won 
between now and early june would be 278265 partial figures 
result from party rules that divide up some votes at the convention 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who was leading the field of 
democratic candidates with 4565 delegates needs to win another 
16255 to wrap up the presidential nomination or put another 
way he has to win more than 58 percent of all the delegates that 
are still left to be won roughly twice as well as hes done so 
far 
dukakis was followed in the delegate count by jesse jackson with 
39555 and gore with 3468 
the virtual threeway tie prompted carter to observe that i 
think its accurate to say the chances are less likely that one of 
the candidates will arrive in atlanta with a clear majority 
new york gov mario cuomo a noncandidate who nonetheless has 
said he would consider stepping into the void at a deadlocked 
convention still says he wants to see his party hold a quiet 
convention but he concedes that it will be difficult for any of 
the current candidates to secure a firstballot victory based on 
results of the primaries and caucuses 
michael said if no candidate holds a majority by the time the 
primaries conclude the rule of conscience that binds delegates to 
the candidates will begin to bend and break 
but susan brophy an aide to dukakis called that assertion 
ridiculous 
these people get into the process because they believe a in 
the process and b in the candidate and not necessarily in that 
order 
and jude barry an aide to missouri rep richard gephardts 
presidential campaign agreed saying i think theres going to 
be loyalty and commitment were prepared to protect what we have 
as im sure the other candidates will as well 
gephardt who had 143 delegates after super tuesday is hoping 
to hang on with a strong showing in the michigan caucuses on march 
26 and the congressional democratic caucuses on april 19 and 20 
gephardt also expects to win big when his house colleagues pick 210 
of their own to be national convention delegates another 43 
delegates will be picked by senate democrats 
our hand certainly will not be weak with that wild card 
barry said 
simon meanwhile is hoping to score a victory next tuesday in 
his home state of illinois

texas on wednesday sued to bar 
shipments of florida citrus in an attempt to protect its fruit 
crops from citrus canker 
us district judge filemon vela on wednesday denied the states 
request for an emergency stay of a federal order feb 11 lifting a 
3year ban on shipments of fresh florida citrus into texas and 
other citrusproducing areas 
vela scheduled a hearing for monday on the suit which accuses 
the us agriculture department of lifting the quarantine without 
giving proper notice and an opportunity for a public hearing 
florida citrus was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus 
canker in florida in 1984 the bacterial disease can cause 
defoliation lesions that render the fruit unmarketable and 
premature dropping of the fruit from the tree 
on feb 15 four days after the quarantine was lifted texas 
imposed an emergency 30day ban on florida citrus but a federal 
court in austin on overturned the ban ruling that federal action 
takes precedence over state 
paul martin director of pest management for the texas 
department of agriculture said texas at least would like to keep 
florida fruit out of the lower rio grande valley where the states 
65 million citrus industry is concentrated 
the issue is were dealing with a real serious disease in 
this case that is a threat to the industry he said 
florida producers maintain that the canker presents a minimal 
threat to the texas citrus industry and some growers there sued to 
stop the texas quarantine

a major business lobbying group is trying to 
keep congress from passing new nationwide clean air legislation 
claiming it will cost too much reduce jobs and increase the trade 
deficit 
david m roderick chairman of the environment committee of the 
business roundtable said wednesday that any legislation should be 
targeted only at areas with dirty air 
however he did not offer specific suggestions for such regional 
measures and said the decisions should be left to the 
environmental protection agency 
roderick commented as the business group released a report 
claiming that clean air legislation passed by the senate 
environment and public works committee earlier this year would cost 
the economy between 15 billion and 73 billion it said the most 
likely figure is 32 billion and also claimed that the measure 
would eliminate between 300000 and 600000 manufacturing jobs 
roderick who is chairman of usx corp complained about acid 
rain provisions in the bill he said the government should wait for 
the final report of the national acid precipitation assessment 
program a 10year 12agency research effort that isnt due for 
completion for another 18 months 
he said complying with the committeepassed bill would cost his 
own companys us steel corp subsidiary 15 billion to 2 
billion 
we would import more semifinished product worsening the 
trade deficit he said 
roderick said the business group also objects to tougher new 
controls on toxic chemical and auto emissions

a person who buys a round for a drinking 
companion may be held liable if the companion gets into an auto 
accident an oregon appeals court ruled wednesday 
the decision involved a suit filed by the red steer bar in 
portland against richard howard whose stepson lonnie d johnson 
got into a accident in 1982 that injured another man 
the bar settled with the injured man james solberg for 
425000 and then sued howard who according to the suit 
accompanied johnson to three bars the two buying drinks for each 
other on the day of the collision 
lawyers for the bar claim howard should be responsible for some 
of the damages because he knew or should have known johnson had a 
drinking problem had been convicted of drunken driving and had 
been in accidents while drinking 
multnomah county circuit judge lee johnson dismissed the 
lawsuit finding noi legal basis for it but the court of appeals 
on wednesday reinstated the case 
the appeals court said howard could be found to owe damages 
under a common law negligence theory that says someone who 
substantially assists or encourages negligent conduct by 
another can be held liable 
the decision is believed the first ruling in oregon to deal with 
liability of a drinking companion at a commercial establishment 
in dismissing the lawsuit the lower court judge said it would 
an unprecedented and unwarranted extension of common law 
liability to hold that howard had a legal duty to solberg

union members in the south have given the 
heaveho to one of the two democratic presidential candidates who 
courted them most actively and sent a strong signal to their once 
reluctant leaders to play ball with the other 
jesse jackson shunned by the aflci0 in 1984 in its failed 
effort to help put walter mondale in the white house received a 37 
percent plurality of votes from union households in 12 southern 
super tuesday primaries according to abctv exit polls 
only 10 percent of union voters in the same primaries cast 
ballots for rep richard gephardt of missouri point man the past 
three years for organized labors top priority in congress 
retaliatory trade legislation 
with massachusetts gov michael dukakis and sen albert gore of 
tennessee equally sharing the other half of the union vote tuesday 
the aflcio is no closer to making a democratic presidential 
endorsement than it was a year ago 
unlike 1984 when mondales challengers pinned a special 
interest tag on labor after its early endorsement of him union 
leaders have proclaimed all of the still viable democratic 
candidates this year as acceptable to them 
consequently on tuesday there were none of the union volunteers 
and phone banks brought into action in the southern primaries four 
years ago to stop thensen gary harts threat of taking the 
nomination away from mondale 
also absent tuesday was union rankandfile worker turnout only 
5 percent of those voting in the democratic southern primaries came 
from union households according to the exit polls 
we have a problem of labor being with everyone so nobody is 
doing anything said joan baggett political director of the 
bricklayers union who took her vacation the past three weeks to 
work as a volunteer for dukakis in the south 
the up side is we havent alienated any of our members by 
endorsing she said the down side is that we havent excited 
them either were just not getting people to the polls 
jacksons strong showing among those union members who did vote 
tuesday indicates he may be the exception while blacks compose 14 
percent of the us population they represent a larger 20 percent 
share of 19 million unionized workers nationwide and an even 
greater proportion in the south 
still for jackson to get 37 percent of the union vote some of 
the support had to come from white workers whose cause jackson has 
championed on hundreds of picket lines over the past four years 
hes been out there on the lines and in the strikes every time 
labor has called on him and this is a healthy response to that 
said jerry clark political director for 11millionmember 
american federation of state county and municipal employees 
loretta bowen who holds the same title for the communications 
workers of america said white members of her union were slated as 
jackson delegates in the south and have expressed a keen interest 
in him in new york as well 
as a spokesman for the gut issues that affect organized labor 
hes articulating them better than any of the candidates she 
said and the fact there has been no endorsement has helped him a 
lot 
but ms bowen who personally favors dukakis and other labor 
political activists believe jacksons plurality of support will 
fade as the primaries move next week to illinois and then on to 
other rust belt states like michigan pennsylvania and ohio where 
unions are much stronger 
the buzzword already is electibility and ive never seen that 
kind of november strategy ever emerge this early before in our 
union she said 
allen zack of the united food and commerical workers union 
noting gores increased use of tv spots emphasizing his proworker 
record in congress said all of the democratic candidates are now 
going after the labor vote 
jesses talking their language better zack said hes not 
trying to tell some laid off steel worker in alabama about some 
hightech job in the future hes talking about restoring their 
standard of living today 
for that reason zack said he was surprised that gephardt with 
his emphasis on slashing trade imbalances through retaliatory 
quotas against foreigners who restrict their imports of us goods 
got no better than 10 percent of the union vote tuesday 
of course he didnt have the money to get on the air as 
much zack said of gephardt if super tuesday confirms 
anything its the power of tv advertising its quite obvious from 
the turnout and the results that a parade hasnt formed yet for 
labor leaders to rush out in front of 
officials for the aflcio said members of its affiliated unions 
running on delegate slates for jackson dukakis and gore all won 
seats tuesday at the democratic national convention in july after 
failing to get a single delegate in new hampshires primary three 
weeks ago 
we didnt do much with gephardt because gephardt didnt do 
much said rex hardesty a spokesman for the federation 
keith geiger a vice president of the national education 
assocation the nations largest union with more than 17 million 
members and not a part of the aflcio said it also won convention 
delegate seats for each of the three democratic frontrunners

nonmedical factors like patients insurance 
coverage and marital status may influence how aggressively they are 
treated for lung cancer a study of more than 1800 cases suggests 
the research raises the possibility that doctors may be 
influenced by more than simply patients medical needs in deciding 
how to treat them 
however more treatment may not always mean better care the 
study found that people who received surgery radiation or 
chemotherapy for lung cancer lived no longer than those who do not 
suggesting that the additional treatment was given largely to 
those who had little or nothing to gain from it 
other experts cautioned that discrimination against the unwed 
and uninsured are not the only possible explanations for the 
studys findings 
the study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
was written by dr e robert greenberg and other doctors from 
dartmouth and the university of vermont 
it was based on 1808 lung cancer cases virtually all of those 
reported in new hampshire and vermont between 1973 and 1976 
treating lung cancer is often futile surgery offers the only 
chance of cure but in most patients the disease has spread too far 
for it to help radiation and sometimes chemotherapy may be used to 
ease symptoms 
the study found that cancer patients were more likely to undergo 
surgery if they were married or had private medical insurance 
those who didnt get surgery were more likely to receive radiation 
or drug therapy if they had insurance 
some doctors may be disquieted to learn that potentially 
curative or palliative symptomrelieving treatments were not 
provided to patients who seemed less able to pay or who lacked a 
spouse the researchers wrote our findings do suggest that the 
presence of inequities in the medical care of poor and socially 
isolated patients with lung cancer 
however in an accompanying editorial drs robert j mayer and 
w bradford patterson of danafarber cancer institute in boston 
said there are other possible explanations 
for instance they raised the possibility that married people 
might seek medical attention earlier when their disease is more 
treatable because their spouses are sensitive to symptoms that 
otherwise might have been ignored and instead of assuming that the 
poor get too little treatment its possible that those with 
insurance get too much simply because they are able to pay 
mayer and bradford wrote that it would be clearly 
undesirable for such factors as insurance coverage to influence 
medical treatment 
they added it would be premature and potentially dangerous 
however to conclude that worrisome factors such as these do 
contribute substantially to the decisionmaking process based on 
review of doctors handling a kind of cancer that cannot be 
effectively treated

jesse jackson collected 25 million votes on 
super tuesday more than any other democrat and enough to cause a 
reexamination of the conventional wisdom that a black cannot be 
nominated for president in the america of 1988 
if jackson were white i think hed be president says 
howard university political science professor ronald walters who 
was jacksons deputy campaign manager in 1984 and is the author of 
a new book black presidential politics in america 
if he were white he wouldnt be in the race says ben j 
wattenberg a scholar at the american enterprise institute and 
coeditor of public opinion magazine 
walters says jacksons experience in the civil rights movement 
is more than the equivalent to service in legislative halls and he 
cites jacksons electrifying quality 
charisma say what you will it still counts in politics 
he says just ask ronald reagan 
wattenberg on the other hand contends that a black could be 
elected president in the america of 1988 but not one with 
jacksons lack of experience holding public office nor his 
controversial record 
jesse jackson went to cuba and said viva che guevara 
praising a man who dedicated his life to the export of communism to 
south and latin america wattenberg said had any other 
politician in american life ever said anything like that he might 
have been scandalized and drummed out of the race 
the question of jacksons electability takes new relevance in 
light of his super tuesday showing network polls said jackson won 
between 8 and 10 percent of the white vote in the south twice as 
much as four years ago 
fortyfour percent of republican voters and 29 percent of 
democratic voters polled by abc news in a dozen southern states 
said they would not vote for jackson if he were the democratic 
nominee by comparison 37 percent of republican voters and 45 
percent of democrats ruled out a vote for pat robertson gary hart 
was rejected by 44 percent of republicans and 35 percent of 
democrats 
jackson drew more votes than michael dukakis or than albert gore 
jr who boycotted the earlier primaries but nonetheless was 
propelled into the ranks of democratic frontrunners on the 
strength of his showing tuesday 
lucius barker a political science professor at st louis 
washington university who was a jackson delegate in 1984 said the 
hecannotwin argument is becoming a code for opposition to jackson 
on racial grounds 
it is going to look more and more odd for people to say 
that he said if you had a white candidate who had the kind of 
support jackson has he would be picking up endorsements he would 
have momentum and you would have the next nominee 
jackson acknowledges the existence of a racial barrier to his 
winning the nomination in campaign speeches he tells the 
apocryphal story of two hardhit farmers in iowa one says to the 
other he likes jacksons message and politics but 
declares jackson i want those people to move from but to 
therefore 
some surveys show 15 to 20 percent of the population would 
reject any black on racial grounds 
it is probably higher said robert smith professor of 
afroamerican politics at howard university who nonetheless 
believes the positions jackson takes are a handicap as substantial 
as that of race 
i would say he would not be nominated or elected if he were 
white he said a substantial number of white persons who 
object to jackson do so more because of his ideology than his 
race 
agreed al thornton jacksons maryland issues director it may 
just be that any liberal would have a problem getting elected 
but paul peterson director of the center for the study of 
american government said whenever any candidate has 
enthusiastic support within the black community it is going to 
cost him support within sectors of the white community 
joseph grandmaison democratic chairman in new hampshire 
believes the disadvantage jackson suffers from race is offset by 
the loyalty of his natural constituency 
look at super tuesday 25 percent of the voters could 
immediately identify with him grandmaison said 
i think thats good its healthy he said comparing 
jacksons gains from race to the loyalty americans of recent ethnic 
origin feel toward dukakis son of greek immigrants 
wattenberg said he regards jackson as a political genius he 
says a black would surely get the nomination if he combined the 
political skills of a jackson and the moderate positions of a tom 
bradley the black mayor of los angeles who narrowly missed being 
elected governor of california 
im not saying there is no racism in america we all know 
there is wattenberg said but the right candidate could deal 
with it

the earl of carnarvon said egyptian relics found 
in his family mansion were brought to britain legitimately by his 
grandfather and howard carter the man who discovered the tomb of 
tutankhamen 
antiquities officials in egypt have said they may try to recover 
the trove of 300 objects discovered recently in highclere castle 
the ancestral home of the fifth earl of carnarvon grandfather of 
the current earl 
but they said they will take no action until more is known about 
the find 
the fifth earl himself an egyptologist financed the expedition 
led by carter which found the almost intact and goldfilled tomb of 
the pharaoh in egypt in 1922 
the records we have discovered show these items were brought 
to england legitimately with the knowledge of the egyptian 
government by my grandfather and howard carter said lord 
carnarvon 
he said he had informed the egyptian ambassador in britain of 
the find but i dont expect any serious claim to be made by the 
egyptian government as this could involve the major part of my 
grandfathers collection which is in the metropolitan museum of 
new york 
ibrahim elnawawy undersecretary of state for the egyptian 
antiquities organization said in cairo on tuesday that he was 
excited by the find but wants to determine what it includes before 
taking action 
it is difficult to say what steps we will take he said 
we will have to go back through our records to see if the items 
were registered and legally taken out of egypt 
the fifth earl died in 1923 from an infected mosquito bite 
nurturing a myth that the 19yearold pharaoh who died in 1323 bc 
had put a death curse on anyone who violated his tomb

secretary of state george p shultz says he 
will press efforts to revive the middle east peace process because 
he is absolutely convinced there is an answer out there 
talking to reporters after meeting wednesday with the house 
foreign affairs committee shultz said his plan for peace between 
the israelis and palestinians is a pretty good and balanced 
concept 
shultz had just briefed the committee privately on his recent 
mission to the middle east 
what we really need to have happen is to get started get 
started on negotiations shultz said im absolutely convinced 
that if we can ever get the key people talking and negotiating that 
theres an answer out there 
committee chairman dante fascell dfla said afterward that 
there was tremendous support for what the secretary has 
undertaken 
fascell said stern israeli action to quell persistent violence 
in the occupied territories has convinced most members of congress 
of the urgent need to find a way into a peace process that will 
provide security for all of the inhabitants of the middle east 
if a vote had been taken in there it would have been unanimous 
in support for what the secretary is trying to do fascell said 
the vote of confidence in shultz comes a week before the planned 
visit here by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who on 
wednesday expressed astonishment at a letter from 30 senators who 
said israel should be willing to give up control of occupied land 
in return for middle east peace 
shamir has blocked attempts inside the israeli cabinet to force 
a vote on the shultz plan the plan calls for an international 
conference to be followed by talks on selfadministration for 
palestinians in the occupied territories and negotiations on the 
final status of the west bank and gaza strip 
your letter came as a surprise at a crucial moment in the 
peace efforts shamir wrote in a threepage response we were 
astonished by the words of criticism you leveled at us on the 
formula of territory for peace 
shamirs letter was sent to sens carl levin dmich and rudy 
boschwitz rminn said levin administrative assistant gordon 
kerr both senators strong supporters of israel were out of town 
and unavailable for comment wednesday night 
twentythree democratic and seven republican senators had sent a 
letter to shamir last week in which they noted that israel in the 
past had supported the idea of land for peace by returning the 
sinai peninsula to egypt 
they noted that shamir had rejected this expression of 
territory for peace and expressed hope that the prime ministers 
statement did not indicate that israel is abandoning a policy 
that offers the best hope for longterm peace 
shamir in his response said israel accepts the un security 
council resolution that provides for an israeli withdrawal from 
land captured in the 1967 war but he did not agree to israels 
eventual withdrawal from the west bank and gaza 
shamir has opposed an international conference on the middle 
east on grounds it would put israel at serious disadvantage 
but fascell suggested that it might be possible to hold an 
international conference that would not disadvantage israel 
especially if the ground rules for the meetings did not permit an 
imposed solution or give participating countries veto power

sen bob dole sounded the first negative note 
of the tv campaigns leading up to next weeks illinois presidential 
primary with an attack on vice president george bushs irancontra 
role 
with his candidacy at stake in illinois after losing all 17 
super tuesday contests the kansas senator on wednesday revived an 
ad that says bush approved selling arms to the ayatollah at the 
same time he chaired a terrorism task force that said america would 
never sell arms for hostages 
the ad says bush has changed his story nine times and owes 
voters an honest answer about his role in the affair 
bush was nearly twothirds of the way to the gop nomination 
after sweeping the super tuesday states he is hoping to ride tv 
ads and local endorsements to an illinois victory that would end 
the senate republican leaders bid 
bushs initial tv ads in illinois emphasized his connection with 
president reagan in one ad he and reagan are shown walking 
together arms around each other projecting an oldpals image 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis led the democratic field 
after super tuesday with victories in seven states he and sen 
albert gore jr of tennessee said they would compete fulltilt in 
illinois despite the presence of favorite sons jesse jackson and 
sen paul simon 
dukakis started two ads tuesday night in illinois in one a 
massachusetts official of the international bricklayers union says 
dukakiss economic policies put people to work the other ad 
highlights dukakis experience as a chief executive and says it is 
unique to the democratic field 
dukakis spokesman steve akey said dukakis spent 15 million on 
tv advertising for super tuesday we havent made the decision on 
a total media buy for illinois but well be on a significant 
amount akey said 
gore spent close to 3 million on super tuesday media and won 
six states spokesman paul risley said that we fully intend to 
run a full media campaign up there in illinois but no spending 
figure has been fixed 
there was some possibility that missouri rep richard gephardt 
would buy illinois television time but spokesman mark johnson said 
the congressman would save most of his resources for the march 26 
caucuses in michigan 
well definitely do a fullscale tv effort in michigan 
johnson said as for illinois were still considering that 
option 
gephardt suffered devastating losses on super tuesday spending 
11 million on television ads but winning only his home state 
part of his problem was being the target of negative ads by both 
dukakis and gore 
akey said the dukakis campaign went negative on super tuesday to 
counter distorted gephardt campaign ads asked if the campaign 
is ready for a gore offensive he replied we are always prepared 
to respond 
jackson and simon said they planned little or no advertising in 
their home state i offer illinois 30 years of service rather 
than a 30second commercial said simon who skipped the super 
tuesday contests 
jackson won five states on super tuesday with a minimal 100000 
media campaign and is expected to do well saturday in south 
carolina where he was born his campaign is in debt but raised a 
substantial amount of money in february and may buy more media time 
in new york california and other large states later in the 
election season according to campaign manager gerald austin

george bush and michael dukakis both have 
large cash reserves to protect their delegate leads as their rival 
presidential hopefuls must refill campaign coffers depleted by the 
super tuesday marathon 
dukakis who leads the democratic delegate chase was sitting on 
a cache of 2 million and anticipating 1 million more in matching 
funds next week said campaign finance chief robert farmer 
it was not known exactly how much cash bush has on hand as he 
tries to follow up his sweep of 16 gop primaries with a knockout 
punch against sen bob dole of kansas in next tuesdays illinois 
primary and beyond 
but bushs campaign has been better heeled and more frugal all 
along than doles or pat robertsons 
bush had more than 9 million in the bank at the start of 
february the bush campaigns director of operations ede holiday 
said wednesday the bills are still coming in from the super 
tuesday states she said but we clearly have plenty of money 
left 
at dole headquarters spokeswoman dale tate said we arent in 
the hole we have cash on hand she declined to say how much the 
dole campaign was anticipating staff cutbacks 
thomas rath a senior dole strategist said in chicago that the 
campaign will have enough money to run commercials in illinois he 
said the kansas senator raised more than 240000 last week 
robertson said tuesday night i do have resources left we 
have the largest donor base of any candidate and i can carry all 
the way to new orleans 
the former television evangelist had spent 176 million through 
january and ended that month with 55 million in cash but debts 
of 6 million 
what jesse jackson calls his poor campaign with a rich 
message has raised 600000 since the iowa caucuses feb 8 
according to campaign manager gerald austin that is more than the 
civil rights leader has ever raised before in such a short time 
austin said the jackson campaign has 250000 in cash on hand 
and anticipates 600000 in federal matching funds in midmarch 
jackson said his wins in five democratic primaries in the south 
came despite being outspent 20 and 30to1 by al gore jr and 
dukakis on television ads jackson says he spent just 100000 on 
ads in the super tuesday states 
austin said jackson will be buying more television time in large 
states like new york and california and he anticipates earmarking 
30000 of his 200000 illinois budget for television 
a gore campaign spokesman paul risley said the tennessee 
senator spent somewhere close to 3 million on ads in the super 
tuesday states the dukakis campaign said it spent 15 million 
while rep richard gephardt bought 11 million worth of air time 
gephardt blamed his meager returns on super tuesday he lost 
everywhere but at home in missouri on his inability to counter 
the drumbeat of gore and dukakis ads 
with 20 states and a million dollars we just could not get 
our message in front of the voters gephardt said he claimed 
they spent up to 7 million to defeat him 
gephardts deputy campaign manager joe trippi said gephardt 
has 250000 on hand and debts of only 75000 trippi said the 
campaign hopes to raise 500000 over the next two weeks 
illinois sen paul simon who bowed out of the super tuesday 
contests to make a lowbudget stand at home said of his campaign 
its kind of a handtomouth operation 
the simon campaign has missed one payroll and is in danger of 
missing a second but simon raised 932000 in february and soon 
will get 364000 in matching funds spokesman terry michael said 
simon owes 145000 but we are in much better financial 
condition right now than either the gore or the gephardt 
campaigns claimed michael

the cigarette girl has returned to the fabled 
rainbow room on the manhattan skyline like a vision from an old 
movie of waspwaisted men in tails and gorgeous dames in sequined 
gowns 
cigars cigarettes she coos to the swells sipping 
cocktails a girl with a tray of smokes a jaunty pillbox hat 
puffed sleeves pumps and fishnet stockings a neckline down to 
there and a skirt slit up to here 
this is the 1980s though and you may call her a cigarette 
woman the people who run the rainbow room atop the artdeco rca 
building use both terms 
the rehabilitation of the famous rockefeller center nightspot 
reportedly cost 25 million much of it for new plumbing lighting 
kitchens carpets and custom work but there was enough left over 
to hire cigarette girls 
they seem to fit in beautifully said joseph baum the 
restaurateur who masterminded the restoration intent on recapturing 
the nightclubs glory days of the 30s and 40s its a 
lighthearted expression of the time 
theyre in their wonderful flouncy dresses and their little 
pageboy hats it just makes everyone smile i think that is just 
part of the scene he said 
the four girls and cigarette girl katherine reddick prefers 
that term were chosen from the ranks of pagers and coatcheckers 
it sounded interesting said ms reddick 24 of manhattan 
im here not so much to sell cigarettes but im really adding 
elegance to the room she said though sales are brisk with 
occasional 100 nights and plenty of generous tips i get lots of 
comments people say it brings them back to the 30s and 40s im 
glad to be able to reminisce with them 
her costume is a 1930s style created by theatrical costume 
designer carrie robbins i saw it and said no problem ms 
reddick recalled with a smile 
i wanted it so that it was suggesting rather than 
suggestive baum said its lighthearted rather than what a 
lot of people have in mind when they think of a cigarette girl 
theres plenty of romance without having to add to it 
and just what do people have in mind judging from the movies 
perhaps a bit of a tart a young woman in the wrong kind of place 
at too late an hour 
ive run into so many ladies who were cigarette girls in the 
40s said ms reddick they were flabbergasted to see me if i 
help bring back those memories thats a great feeling they say 
being a cigarette girl in those days was a very very important 
thing 
of course they did it without having their parents find out 
they were working in bars 
patrons of the newold rainbow room welcome the women who sell 
the cigarettes at 2 a pack with smiles 
whenever i thought of a cigarette girl it was in a 1930s 
movie with a big chic nightclub said tom cordisco 27 of 
brooklyn thats what it reminds you of 
thats just what baum had in mind a lot things that were part 
of that scene disappeared he said costs went up places 
didnt do these sort of things for a long time 
bringing back cigarette girls he said brings back the sound 
of astaire and lobster thermidor and dancing and the rainbow

the federal aviation administration has 
declined to issue tighter restrictions suggested by another agency 
on planes and helicopters flown by the news media and others over 
major accident sites 
the faa said the restrictions suggested by the national 
transportation safety board would be impractical 
the ntsb had urged that the faa prohibit aircraft flights over 
major accident sites especially when they involve spills of 
hazardous flammable materials or a fire and rescue workers might be 
endangered 
the ntsb had cited a series of accidents most of them 
involving train wrecks in which toxic substances were spilled 
where news media helicopters flew so close to the accident scene 
that they endangered rescue workers 
but faa administrator allan mcartor wrote to ntsb chairman jim 
burnett recently that the agency saw no reason to change the rules 
a copy of the letter was made available wednesday 
current faa regulations require the agency to issue a formal 
notice in each individual case to pilots when flights over an 
accident site must be prohibited because of a potential danger 
the safety board said that the notice is often not readily 
available to pilots and that some pilots may specifically avoid 
asking about a notice so they may legally fly over an accident site 
in responding to the safety board which is in charge of 
investigating major transportation accidents mcartor called the 
current restrictions that are tailored to each accident the most 
effective approach 
to change the regulations as the ntsb had recommended it would 
be necessary to describe every type of potential disaster or hazard 
that may occur mcartor said he also said pilots may not know 
when such restrictions are in force 
while rejecting the ntsbs call for broader restrictions the 
faa nevertheless said it was calling for tighter enforcement of 
existing restrictions it said the faa intends to aggressively 
enforce sanctions against pilots who intentionally violate the 
terms of the mandatory notice when it is put into effect at an 
accident site 
violators would have their pilots license suspended for a 
minimum of 180 days 
the ntsb had said that a number of accidents dating back to 1978 
demonstrated a problem with how the faa restricts aircraft at 
accident sites in several of the cases the downwash from 
helicopters interfered in rescue attempts by fanning the flames of 
a fire or blowing toxic vapors in the direction of workers the 
safety board said 
there recently have been several incidents in which helicopter 
pilots helped in rescue attempts or as was the case in denver 
helped apprehend a criminal 
faa spokesman fred farrar said however that these incidents 
had no bearing on the agencys response to the ntsb recommendations 
the agency agreed with two ntsb recommendations aimed at 
offering guidance to pilots on obtaining information about flight 
restrictions that are put in place and developing ways to better 
educate pilots about the dangers of flying too close to an accident 
site

nuclear regulatory commission officials say 
the agencys rules provide commercial reactors adequate safeguards 
against terrorist attacks but its staff will additionally look at 
the potential threat from truck bombs 
nrc chairman lando w zech told a house subcommittee wednesday 
that the commission has confidence in the current safety rules but 
recently instructed its staff to draft a series of options related 
to a truckbomb threat as a prudent measure 
the disclosure came as nrc officials clashed with rep sam 
gejdenson dconn chairman of the house interior and insular 
affairs subcommittee on general oversight and investigations over 
commission security requirements 
gejdenson urged the commission to beef up its security 
standards which require plant operators to protect against a 
hypothetical threat of several terrorists armed with handheld 
automatic weapons and aided by an accomplice inside the plant 
fuel from traditional us commercial reactor cannot be stolen 
and used to make nuclear bombs but gejdenson said he feared 
terrorists could break into a nuclear reactor hold it and the 
surrounding region hostage or trigger a nuclear meltdown that would 
release deadly radiation into the atmosphere 
rep peter a defazio dore pointed to a threat last june 
from staterun tehran radio that said iran could attack us 
reactors in retaliation against american forces in the persian gulf 
you have people here who want to be martyrs defazio said 
gejdenson said the regulations should protect against a car or 
truck bursting through a plants chainlink fence attackers 
invading from a boat and truck bombs like the ones used in 
terrorist attacks overseas 
simple prudence and common sense dictate that the nrc assume 
that terrorist have cars and that licensees should be required to 
protect against this level of threat gejdenson said in an 
interview last week the congressman said the gang that couldnt 
shoot straight could take any one of these facilities under the 
current standards 
zech said the regulations are adequate and appropriate at this 
time and he said the nrc is in daily contact with us 
intelligence agencies monitoring any potential threats 
but he added that the nrc told the staff last month to prepare 
a range of options regarding a truckbomb threat for commission 
consideration such recommendations could eventually become 
regulations said nrc spokesman bob newlin 
zech said the staff review stems from a december classified 
report by the national security council but gejdenson contended 
the move was a response to his investigation 
gejdenson said that the agency began working on a truckbomb 
regulation following the october 1983 bombing of the marine 
barracks in lebanon but that the commission never approved the 
proposal

a top haitian army officer reportedly indicted with 
his exwife and brother on drug charges was the second caribbean 
military leader in four weeks to be accused here of helping cocaine 
smugglers 
a federal grand jury wednesday indicted col jeanclaude paul 
commander of the largest unit in haitis 6000man army pauls 
brother antonio and exwife merielle delinois sources close to 
the case said on condition of anonymity 
a witness has said the colonel allowed cocaine smugglers to land 
at his ranch 
us magistrate william c turnoff ordered the indictment sealed 
immediately but federal authorities were expected to unseal it 
today 
there was no comment wednesday from the colonel or haitis 
government 
paul heads the feared 700man dessalines battalion in the 
capital of portauprince soldiers in the battalion ruthlessly 
suppressed antigovernment demonstrations last year and were 
accused of protecting gunmen who disrupted haitis november 
presidential elections killing 34 people 
paul was considered close to the militarydominated junta that 
ruled haiti from early 1986 until a militarysupported civilian 
president took office feb 7 
on feb 5 panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega was 
indicted in miami and tampa on charges he accepted 46 million in 
protection money from colombian cocaine dealers laundered money 
supplied drug laboratories and shielded drug kingpins 
the investigation of paul has been widely reported for weeks 
haitian army officials and the governmentcontrolled media have 
defended him against reports of his involvement in cocaine 
trafficking 
asked during a recent interview about reports of drug smuggling 
by the army president leslie manigat said i cant base my 
judgment on rumors 
all interviews with army officials must be cleared through army 
chief of staff gen carl nicolas who refused a written request 
from the associated press to speak with paul 
the junta replaced dictator jeanclaude duvalier in february 
1986 when he fled to exile in france 
during the juntas twoyear rule paul seldom appeared in public 
when he did it often was to serve as bodyguard for two junta 
members lt gen henri namphy the junta president and now 
military chief and brig gen williams regala now defense 
minister paul also appeared on the stage during manigats 
inauguration at which the president pledged to stop drug 
trafficking the colonel was among the military guards who escorted 
manigat back to the presidential palace after the inauguration 
one of the witnesses in the case was miami businessman osvaldo 
quintana 35 who told a news conference last month that the 
colonel helped him smuggle cocaine into the united states in 
december 1986 
we flew the shipment out of his own personal ranch in 
haiti about 90 miles outside portauprince said quintana who 
has testified for the government in drug trials 
quintana has said haitian military officials routinely aided 
drug flights from colombia allowing them to land and be serviced 
before proceeding to the bahamas to drop their loads 
he said he originally was approached by ms delinois to take 
part in the smuggling 
ms delinois was arrested in miami on drug charges last march 
but skipped bond and is believed to be hiding in haiti according 
to the us drug enforcement administration 
dea affidavits filed in the delinois case said quintana met with 
paul and his brother antonio at the ranch and watched while a 
plane carrying 220 pounds of cocaine took off

democratic presidential contender michael 
dukakis saying hes in an uphill battle in ilinois attacked 
rival sen albert gore jr as a regional candidate who would have 
little chance to win the general election in november 
the massachusetts governor is also touting himself as the 
candidate who has the best track record on the economy 
dukakis began airing a television spot here in which a 
bricklayers union official tells voters that if they want to go 
out for a beer they should call their buddy but if you care 
about your job mike dukakis is your guy 
in tuesdays illinois primary illinois sen paul simon is 
expected to garner favoriteson votes and the chicagobased jesse 
jackson is likely to tap black support in his hometown 
that leaves dukakis battling gore for the remaining share and 
dukakis suggested that he was a better choice to represent the 
party as the nominee 
im not so sure hes a major contender dukakis said of 
gore a guy from massachusetts beat him in texas beat him in 
florida he wasnt willing to go into the early primaries but i 
still take everyone seriously 
michael bakalis dukakis illinois campaign chairman said white 
bluecollar voters in chicago could form dukakis base in illinois 
paul simon in the 1984 senate race did not do very well in 
chicago particularly in the white ethnic precincts bakalis 
said 
those were precisely the precincts dukakis targeted wednesday in 
his first full day of campaigning in illinois in the week leading 
up to the primary 
he met over breakfast with laidoff steel workers and then 
visited the metron steel warehouse in chicago owned by one of 
dukakis many greekamerican supporters andrew athens 
illinois will send 173 delegates to the democratic national 
convention in atlanta of those 113 will be decided next tuesday 
the rest are held by various party and elected officials bakalis 
said 74 of the 113 will come from the greater chicago area 
the dukakis camp plans to wage a traditional campaign in 
illinois with an appearance at tonights democratic party dinner 
a spot in chicagos famous st patricks day parade and a message 
geared toward working men and women said dukakis national 
political coordinator charles baker 
win lose or draw and we dont expect to win you want 
people here to care about this race baker said 
the dukakis campaign remains the financial frontrunner after 
the media spending of super tuesday campaign finance chief robert 
farmer said dukakis is raising half a million dollars a week 
coming out of super tuesday he said dukakis has 2 million in the 
bank and another 1 million on the way in federal matching funds 
bakalis said the governor has budgeted 300000 to 350000 for 
the state leading up to next tuesday that amount could increase 
he said if dukakis decides to increase his media advertising 
with two illinois residents in the race obviously its going 
to be an uphill battle dukakis said 
at this point i think that most people would think that third 
place would be respectable he said but i want to do better 
than that

the federal aviation administration is coming 
under criticism from its boss for not being aggressive enough in 
issuing civil fines against airlines because of airport security 
shortcomings 
transportation secretary jim burnley says he is disturbed that 
the faa has not been complying with a directive issued last summer 
and reiterated in october calling for aggressive enforcement 
actions against airlines that allow mock weapons to go undetected 
at an airport screening point 
the faa has been testing security at the nations airports by 
passing phony weapons through the checkpoints to see if they are 
found last year a report concluded that as many as one in five 
mock weapons in faa tests go through undetected 
the discovery prompted the transportation department to order 
the faa to get tough with airlines so that security is improved 
the airlines are responsible for airport security checkpoints 
although the stations are usually staffed through a contractor 
burnley said wednesday that the department specifically told the 
faa to take enforcement actions including a possible fine when a 
security checkpoint allows a mock weapon through without detection 
burnley aides released a sharply worded memorandum sent earlier 
this week to faa administrator allan mcartor in it the 
transportation secretary said he was deeply disturbed that five 
months after the crackdown was ordered the faa is only taking 
action if carriers fail three out of five tests at a checkpoint and 
is only issuing a fine for the third failure 
i am troubled by continuing reports of failure by the faa to 
fully implement these directed improvements and to strictly enforce 
security requirements he wrote 
mcartor said in a statement i absolutely share secretary 
burnleys concern that faa aggressively implement all security 
recommendations i have instructed faa personnel that the rules 
must be strictly enforced 
agency officials had no further comment 
the incident however is likely to further strain relations 
between burnley and mcartor 
the washington post reported earlier this week that burnley was 
displeased with the faas top public affairs officer because some 
regulatory action involving commuter airlines had been disclosed 
prematurely just when burnley wanted media attention focused on a 
speech he was making at the national press club 
wendy democker who is burnleys spokesman denied that burnley 
had anything to do with the departure of air force lt col james 
c jannette from the post jannett who had been at the job only 
three months and had been a personal choice of mcartor was asked 
by the pentagon to return to his military duties she said 
meanwhile there have been differences between mcartor and 
burnley on other aviation matters last year mcartor told reporters 
he planned by april to submit legislation to congress on a national 
policy to deal with noise problems at airports 
burnley said wednesday no such plans are in the works and that 
mcartor had changed his mind burnley often has said he believes 
such legislation would be foolhardy because congress has no desire 
to tell local officials what to do about airport noise

two years after they crashed the state 
democratic party and helped to make their leader a household name 
lyndon larouches illinois disciples have resurfaced again on the 
state primary election ballot 
despite challenges from the democratic party larouche and more 
than 20 of his supporters are in the running in the partys primary 
on tuesday for posts ranging from president to county recorder of 
deeds 
for state party leaders its an unwelcome reminder of the upset 
victories of two larouche followers in the 1986 democratic primary 
an event that threw the party into disarray 
we fell down on our job in 86 said state sen vince 
demuzio who became state democratic party chairman after the 
primary debacle nobody gave them much chance to do anything and 
we ended up with two of them on our ticket we dont intend to 
allow that again 
for the larouche supporters its another chance to air the 
perennial presidential candidates world view in which various 
conspiracies link aids drugs international bankers and the 
british royal family 
the 1986 victories of larouches illinois followers marked the 
beginning of a period of heightened scrutiny that culminated in 
raids by authorities on larouches leesburg va headquarters and 
his indictment in boston on federal obstructionofjustice charges 
his supporters see these actions as a conspiracy by the 
democratic party and the soviet union who they believe are trying 
to block larouche from gaining political power 
if this man is such a wacko fringe candidate why is the 
democratic party spending all of this money to keep him out of the 
election said sheila jones a leader of the larouche 
organization in illinois 
demuzio has a ready answer 
he has repudiated the platform and leadership of the party 
nationally and in illinois he said were not going to afford 
these fringe candidates the chance to have the democratic party as 
their haven 
but illinois democrats succeeded in only one of a flurry of 
challenges to larouchebacked candidacies leaving larouche and a 
platoon of followers on the ballot 
larouches name will appear throughout the state on the march 15 
democratic presidential preference ballot in four chicagoarea 
congressional districts larouche followers have filed full slates 
of wouldbe delegates to the democratic national convention 
larouche supporters will be on the ballot for congress in at 
least five districts mostly in the chicago area 
and janice hart one of the larouche supporters who won in 1986 
is running for cook county circuit court clerk 
perhaps as a result of their 1986 success larouche supporters 
seem to have focused their efforts in illinois political observers 
say 
in the 10 other states where democratic primary election filing 
deadlines have passed only four congressional candidates have been 
identified as larouche disciples said peggy connolly spokeswoman 
for the national democratic congressional campaign committee 
its a natural consequence of what they perceive as their 
success there in illinois in 1986 she said theyve lost 
their wind in every other region of the country 
democratic party leaders and candidates say the larouche 
followers campaigns in illinois seem to have begun and ended with 
the filing of nominating petitions to get on the primary ballot 
with their legal challenges stymied democratic party leaders 
have focused their antilarouche efforts on mailings to voters in 
the areas where larouche followers are on the ballot 
cook county democrats are circulating almost 3 million brochures 
warning voters that the larouchies have invaded the ballot and 
urging them to be careful when casting their votes 
some democrats have discussed the possibility of rewriting state 
election law to allow party leaders to screen candidates 
seeking to run in the party primary though they acknowledge doubts 
about the constitutionality of such a measure 
but demuzio and other party leaders believe public disdain is 
the only effective political weapon against larouche followers 
i dont know how you keep them from getting on the ballot 
demuzio said this is america you know

george bush with the support of gov jim 
thompson and most republican party leaders will stump his way 
through all corners of illinois his campaign says 
after a oneday respite from campaign rigors bush was flying to 
chicago today to begin an intensive five days of voteseeking as he 
tries to pad his formidable lead in the race for nominating 
convention delegates 
between now and next tuesday bush will have crisscrossed the 
state several times with thompson a fourterm governor at his 
side most of the way 
he was beginning his campaign with a speech to the gop governors 
club luncheon in chicago to be followed later in the day with 
lincoln day dinner appearances in champaign and alton bush has the 
endorsements of 93 of 102 county gop chairmen in illinois 
the bush campaign style will be similar to the one he used 
successfully in new hampshire south carolina and the super tuesday 
states he is scheduled to discuss agricultural issues friday and 
visit a methanol plant later that day 
with thompson at his side bush will enjoy the benefits of 
having the support of the states top officeholder 
in advance of bushs campaign foray thompsons press secretary 
david fields said the governor had virtually cleared his schedule 
of any conflicting events 
the governor and bush will be together pretty much through the 
whole five days fields said were talking about the length 
and breadth of illinois a pretty good crosssection 
pete teeley bushs chief spokesman said of thompson hes a 
terrific campaigner and we sure want him to be with us 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said earlier this week that 
the vice president seeking to win the 82 convention delegates 
illinois offers would go through all corners of the state 
campaign directly and forthrightly discuss issues and get his 
message out 
bush who has amassed 805 of the 1139 delegates needed for 
nomination has refused to accept sen bob doles demand that the 
two meet in oneonone campaign debates in illinois 
rep lynn martin rill cochairman of the bush campaign said 
that while bush would travel throughout the state he would focus 
on the stronghold of the state republican party the collar 
communities surrounding chicago 
she said that dole has a right to say to the illinois farming 
communities im one of you and george bush cant do that 
but martin also said that illinois is not iowa and our 
farming communities did not have the same difficulties 
bush finished a distant third behind dole and pat robertson in 
iowa and a part of the reason was disenchantment there with reagan 
administration farm policy 
martin said i dont think theres any question that bush will 
win the popularity vote but dole will do well in some districts 
ken wright one of bushs principal strategists in florida 
said i think going to illinois weve got a great organization 
up there gov thompson is enormously popular there and i think 
hell do very well

the fashion king of milan giorgio the 
gorgeous achieved the impossible and bettered his own best 
armanis fallwinter collection shown wednesday was a power 
house of ideas he showed the tiniest jackets cropping them just 
above the waist sleeves were long and tight the definitely marked 
the demise of wide armholes and overlypadded shoulders 
always a jacket specialist he offered more new shapes than ever 
before the choice ranged from a jacket that was raised in front 
and dipped at the back then there was the one with the soft cowl 
neckline and yet another that sported a sidezipped bandolier in 
matching fabric 
pants were plentiful they came cuffless in smooth wools 
falling loosely from unpressed waist pleats he also showed some 
bermuda shorts and accompanied them with the thighhigh suede wader 
boots that have been a main feature of these milan shows 
there were lots of different hat shapes ranging from a coal 
miners cap to a broadbrimmed flatcrowned felt of the sort that 
clint eastwood usually favors in his cowboy movies 
fabrics designed thread by thread by armani the perfectionist 
were superb 
laura biagiotti the designer who lives and works out of a 
medieval castle nestled in the countryside outside rome showed 
styles that were perfect for an elegant castle dweller 
there were soft cashmere horse blankets ideal for keeping 
out the chill along the ramparts they wrapped up comfy 
sweaterdresses oversize twinsets or slimfitting pants all in 
flat knit 
daytime colors were rustic oatmeal mossgreen and maize and 
there was moderation in the details with a more natural 
shoulderline flatheeled footwear and skirtlengths just a 
fraction above the knee 
biagiotti took paisleypatterned fringed head scarves in fine 
wool and fashioned them into wraparound skirts and did an 
attractive series of that fashion indispensable the everpopular 
little black dress in velvet or silk crepe 
on a completely different wavelength was the baby doll look of 
the collection designed by muriel grateau for complice models 
with elfin hairdos wore short highwaisted styles with 
tightfitting bodices and jauntily gathered skirts 
a brandnew girlish look for coats in double wool crepe featured 
a shoulderframing cape collar and a broad martingale belt that 
tied tightly in a bow at the waist in back 
party dresses came in the same style with waist gathers 
transferred to just under the bust while miniskirts were decorated 
with frills and ribbon cockades 
almost all the clothes at complice came in a rich titian red 
laceup shoes and stockings included 
there is a certain style that the italian designers have always 
done beautifully understated but elegant tailored blazers 
wellcut pants and loose top coats in menstype smooth woolens 
it is a look that is timeless and unbeatable and the women of 
milan love it basile did it for them again tucking pants into the 
newly fashionable winter boots and putting velvet on collars for an 
even more wellbred air

president corazon aquino today called 
onesided a report by amnesty international alleging widespread 
human rights abuse in the philippines during her two years in 
office 
also today mrs aquino said she had no plans to run for 
reelection when her term expires in june 1992 it was the clearest 
statement of her political intentions to date 
mrs aquino said there have been delays in punishing human 
rights violators because the philippines respects the rights of the 
accused to due process 
on wednesday the londonbased human rights organization alleged 
that mrs aquinos government had used torture murder and illegal 
arrests in fighting the countrys 19year communist rebellion 
amnesty international called on the government to end killings 
by military and paramilitary forces saying they represented the 
countrys most serious human rights problem since mid1987 
i think the amnesty international report was very onesided 
mrs aquino told filipino reporters she said the organization had 
relied only on social activist groups such as the churchbacked 
task forcedetainees in compiling its report 
the president urged such groups to cooperate with the 
governments commission on human rights in providing documented 
evidence to help find and punish human rights violators 
on wednesday task forcedetainees said its investigation showed 
that 7444 filipino civilians were arrested illegally in 1987 
eclipsing the 5967 arrests in 1985 when ferdinand marcos was 
president 
mrs aquino came to power when marcos authoritarian regime 
collapsed in february 1986 there has been speculation mrs aquino 
would seek a second term using a technicality in the new 
constitution 
i dont think so she told filipino reporters she added 
i have never had political ambitions 
the constitution drafted by an aquinoappointed commission and 
approved in a plebiscite last year limits the president and vice 
president to one sixyear term 
but transitory provisions in the constitution temporary 
measures designed to ease the transition of power also state that 
the first regular elections for president under the new charter 
will be held on the second monday of may 1992 
some political observers and aquino supporters have interpreted 
the wording of the transitory provision to mean mrs aquino is not 
bound by the oneterm limit 
in its report amnesty international praised the aquino 
government for some very real progress in human rights 
particularly in restoring legal safeguards and in greatly reducing 
the use of torture 
but it called on the government to reaffirm publicly its 
commitment to protect human rights the report said amnesty 
international knew of no cases where soldiers had been punished for 
human rights violations 
it cited the february 1987 killing of 17 civilians in lupao the 
military said the killings took place after a lieutenant was killed 
by a communist sniper during a patrol in lupao 
with regards to no soldier being convicted in fact charges 
have been filed against the soldiers involved or implicated in the 
lupao massacre mrs aquino said 
we are living in a democracy while it is true there is 
evidence everyone is entitled to due process of law even those 
who are accused should have their day in court 
mary concepcion bautista chairwoman of the commission on human 
rights also criticized the amnesty international report as 
exaggerated 
she said the government was investigating about 200 cases of 
human rights abuse claiming there is a serious effort to clean 
up 
mrs bautista said investigations of human rights abuses against 
the military were often not publicized to avoid demoralizing 
soldiers who are fighting the rebels 
the insurgents dont follow the rules she said soldiers 
complain that when they fight the insurgents they have one hand 
tied behind their back 
last year about 150 police and soldiers were fatally shot on 
manila streets communist rebels claimed responsibility for about 
half the killings 
an average of 10 soldiers civilians or police officers are 
killed daily in clashes between government and rebel forces

although the superpower missile treaty 
has not been ratified yet the soviet union is already adjusting 
its nuclear missile force to regain firepower lost through the 
accord natos top commander said 
the commander us gen john r galvin said on wednesday that 
the moves were expected and were not in violation of the treaty 
signed last december to eliminate the superpowers medium and 
shorterrange nuclear missiles worldwide missiles covered by the 
treaty have ranges from 300 to 3000 miles 
they are restructuring their missile force galvin said in 
an interview with the associated press in his spartan office at 
supreme headquarters allied powers europe galvin likened the 
soviet moves to reshaping a wall from which some stones have been 
removed 
i dont want to get too specific but i get some 
indications that the soviets are readjusting the stones on the 
wall he said adding that the western allies would do this too 
galvin added the soviets will retarget other warheads into 
western europe to cover military targets previously assigned to 
the hundreds of ss20 rockets to be dismantled under terms of the 
superpower accord 
he said it was not yet clear how the soviets would accomplish 
this they may have to take warheads that were aimed in 
another direction and aim them toward western europe galvin said 
the net result he said is likely to be that the soviets will 
partially offset the loss of their ss20s which are triplewarhead 
ballistic missiles capable of striking all of western europe 
the overall capabilities of the soviets would still be 
somewhat lower a small amount lower because of the treaty 
galvin said but the adjustments will to some degree cover 
that 
the north atlantic treaty organization also is seeking to adjust 
and modernize its remaining nuclear forces in europe to partially 
compensate for the loss of the us cruise and pershing 2 missiles 
but there is disagreement in nato over how and when to do this 
according to galvin it was important for nato eventually to 
replace its aging lance shortrange nuclear missiles which are not 
covered by the treaty with a more modern version of longer reach 
but he said a final decision on replacing the lance missiles in 
west germany was not needed before 1990 
he said nato arms modernization is necessary to help defeat one 
of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs chief aims to rid europe 
of all nuclear weapons 
despite gorbachevs recent pronouncements about seeking a more 
peaceful relationship with the west galvin said the kremlin 
leader has not abandoned the longstanding soviet aim of dominating 
western europe 
hes moving in exactly the same direction he said 
galvin said many westerners are responding to gorbachevs softer 
stance in the same way a hostage feels kindly toward his captor 
after being released 
maybe were seeing a little bit of that psychology where we 
have felt ourselves under the pressure of the powerful military 
forces of the soviet union and the warsaw pact for so many decades 
that when we get some indication of a friendly nod in our 
direction we respond enormously because its such a change he 
said 
according to galvin western governments should not move too 
quickly to encourage gorbachevs efforts to modernize the soviet 
economy since a stronger economy could make moscow a more 
formidable enemy

nbc must surrender to a judge outtakes from an 
interview with a former lyndon larouche consultant who said an aide 
to the political extremist discussed a plot to assassinate henry 
kissinger a federal appeals court ruled 
the decision wednesday by the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
upheld a lower court order that videotape of the entire interview 
must be surrendered for possible use at the conspiracy and fraud 
trial of larouche six aides and five political organizations 
the court also upheld a contempt citation against the network 
nbc had contended that surrendering portions of the interview 
that were not broadcast violated its first amendment right against 
judicial intrusion into news gathering and editorial decisions 
us district judge robert e keeton ruled that the rights of 
the defendants to have access to the interview with forrest lee 
fick outweighed those of the network 
at stake in the defendants side of the equation are their 
constitutional rights to a fair trial under the fifth amendment 
the appeals court wrote in concurring with keeton whose original 
order called for him to review the entire interview and determine 
its relevance to the case 
nbc attorney floyd abrams said the network would decide within a 
few days whether to appeal to the us supreme court 
it is an opinion which we believe does not sufficiently 
recognize the first amendment rights of broadcasters abrams said 
keeton had issued a similar order requiring cbs to surrender 
outtakes of an interview it conducted with another larouche aide 
cbs complied 
nbc interviewed fick for 100 minutes and in april 1986 broadcast 
a oneminute portion of the interview in which fick said he and 
larouche aide paul goldstein discussed a plot to assassinate 
kissinger the former secretary of state 
fick of reading pa worked as a larouche security consultant 
with another reading man roy frankhauser frankhauser was 
convicted in december of conspiring to obstruct a federal grand 
jury investigation of alleged credit card and loan fraud by 
larouche followers during his 1984 presidential campaign 
fick was a prosecution witness against frankhauser both are 
expected to be called as witnesses at the trial of larouche and 
aides including goldstein 
defense lawyers contend the entire nbc interview will help show 
fick and frankhauser were among scores of operatives planted in 
larouche organizations by the fbi and cia to gather information and 
ultimately to ruin larouche and cripple his fundraising operation

the seawolf the pentagons newest nuclear 
attack submarine scheduled to begin production later this year 
will help the united states dominate the soviet union at sea long 
into the next century the navy says 
the ssn21 will have double the fire power and be faster 
quieter and more survivable than the ssn688 los angeles class sub 
which the seawolf is expected to replace as the nations chief 
attack submarine vice adm bruce demars assistant chief of naval 
operations for undersea warfare told a house panel wednesday 
the seawolf which has been in the research and design stage for 
six years has been criticized by some lawmakers who fear the sub 
is not advanced enough for the soviets planned successor to their 
akula attack sub 
but demars dismissed that notion telling the house armed 
services sea power subcommittee that the seawolf is the 
foundation for farterm submarine superiority 
last year a house subcommittee tried to delay funds for the 
project but congress restored the money navy officials have 
warned that such a delay could severely damage the seawolf program 
and cause massive cost overruns

for the first time the cuban government has 
invited delegates of the un human rights commission to visit cuba 
to investigate the human rights situation on the island nation 
one united states delegate called the offer a diversionary 
tactic while another questioned the way it was brought before 
the commission 
the chief cuban representative to the 43nation commission raul 
roa kouri said on wednesday that six members could go to cuba in 
order to see the situation prevailing there in human rights and 
to inform the commission 
roa who is also a deputy foreign minister said the commission 
members allowed to visit would be the chairman alioune sene of 
senegal and five other delegates one from each of the regional 
groups 
reading what he said was a letter to sene from his government 
roa indicated that the cuban government would arrange the 
necessary contacts and interviews with the officials and competent 
authorities of our country who would answer all their questions 
he also said the representatives would be given access to 
penitentiary establishments but did not elaborate roa did not 
give a date for the planned visit 
roas remarks in spanish were translated into english by an 
interpreter us delegate daniel pipes said the cuban invitation 
was made to draw attention away from a usproposed resolution 
which calls for the un secretarygeneral to investigate charges 
of human rights abuses in cuba and for cuba to allow the 
international red cross to visit cuban prisons 
theyre afraid of the vote on that resolution pipes told 
the associated press 
another us delegate lewis anselem told the commission the 
cuban invitation was the first time that the cuban government has 
shown a willingness to have a united nations organ look into the 
human rights situation in that country and into the allegations 
about that situation 
but anselem said some of the procedures used to bring it before 
the commission were highly irregular 
the proposed visit was introduced in the commission meeting by 
colombia reportedly with the support of argentina mexico and 
peru all members of the commission cuba is an observer this year 
anselem said the united states would not accept the proposed 
visit as a substitute for its own resolution 
the united states for the second year in a row is pursuing its 
goal of having the commission examine alleged human rights abuses 
in cuba this year the us government appointed a former cuban 
political prisoner armando valladares to head the us delegation 
the cuban government has attacked the appointment of valladares 
a poet who wrote a book about torture and degrading treatment he 
said he suffered during 22 years in cuban prisons 
valladares has said the united states in pressing the cuba 
issue is trying to fight a selective sensitivity in the 
commission which routinely condemns human rights violations in the 
israelioccupied territories chile and south africa 
the united states maintains that human rights abuses in cuba 
include torture clandestine executions and religious and political 
persecution 
the ussponsored resolution cites allegations of human rights 
abuses in cuba made by other international groups including 
amnesty international and the organization of american states 
the resolution is to be voted on before the commission ends its 
annual meeting on friday

police clashed today with 200 tibetan 
refugees who tried to march to the chinese embassy in new delhi 
and seven tibetans and nine policemen were injured authorities 
said 
the refugees gathered near the parliament house and chanted 
china stop killing tibetans in a rally commemorating the 29th 
anniversary of the abortive uprising against chinese rule in lhasa 
tibets capital 
police intervened when the crowd surged toward a police 
barricade to attempt a march to the chinese embassy 
we were not only stopped but badly beaten said tashi 
namgyal secretarygeneral of the tibetan youth congress the 
policemen poked bamboo sticks and hit us on our heads 
it was on march 10 1959 that tibetans rose in revolt against 
the chinese red army that invaded tibet in 1949 china claims the 
region was part of china since the 13th century tibetans dispute 
that claim 
after the uprising the dalai lama spiritual and temporal 
leader of the tibetans and 100000 of his followers fled to india 
the tibetan godking has since maintained exile headquarters in 
dharmasala in northern india 
in a statement issued today from dharamsala the dalai lama 
called on tibetans to honor the courage of our brethren in tibet 
who have taken to the streets to draw attention to their suffering 
under chinese colonial rule 
it is indeed a sad reflection of the state of the world that 
violence seems to be required for the international community to 
pay attention 
he was referring to a clash in lhasa last saturday which left as 
many as five tibetans and three police dead 
the rally site in new delhi was strewn with stones shoes 
sandals and sticks after the clash with police the chinese embassy 
in the nearby diplomatic district was cordoned off 
police accused the tibetans of starting trouble 
for no reason the tibetans became violent and started hurling 
rocks at us said police officer shanti kumar jain we had to 
stop them 
it was the second rally by tibetans in new delhi this week on 
monday hundreds of tibetans held a demonstration and chanted we 
shall overcome they were prevented monday from marching on the 
chinese embassy

without knowing the exact size of the soviet 
arsenal the us intelligence community could effectively verify 
soviet compliance with the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty according to a classified report by the arms control and 
disarmament agency 
the washington post reported today that the acda study which 
was sent tuesday to members of the senate foreign relations 
committee said the pacts verification measures posed 
significant risks for the soviets of us detection even though 
us intelligence cannot achieve a total count of soviet 
mediumrange and shorterrange nucleararmed missiles and lauchers 
that are to be eliminated under the agreement 
the post said the acda report seemed to answer criticisms by 
sen jesse helms rnc and others who maintain that soviet 
compliance with the inf treaty cannot be verified because the us 
intelligence community is uncertain about how many ss20 
mediumrange missiles the soviets have 
the report also said that us officials have assumed soviet 
declarations for total numbers locations and characteristics of 
their treatylimited items could be false so they would not be 
used to verify soviet compliance 
the soviets said last year they planned to destroy 650 deployed 
or stored ss20s but analysts at the defense intelligence agency an 
arm of the defense department have said the soviets have at least 
165 additional ss20s helms said this was an indication the soviets 
may have hidden some of the missiles for potential use against us 
european alllies 
the report acknowledge that soviet retentions of some missiles 
couldnt be ruled out but noted that the united states would 
scrutinize the destruction of all launchcritical equipment and 
that all test flights would be barred six months after the treaty 
takes affect

striking scriptwriters agreed to resume 
negotiations today with both sides under a gag order not to 
disclose details of the talks while producers of the oscar 
ceremonies vowed the show must go on 
the writers guild of america went on strike sunday after 
rejecting the latest offer by the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers the dispute centered on artistic control of 
scripts and money received from reruns 
commissioner leonard farrell of the federal mediation and 
conciliation service imposed a gag order on negotiators for both 
sides tuesday blocking any disclosures about the bargaining 
its a mediation session and thats all i can say guild 
spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said after the gag order was imposed 
its not an unusual situation in a strike she said its 
important that those topics on the table be kept there rather than 
be aired in the media 
writers working on the academy awards show slated for april 11 
said they left its script half written when they walked out but 
producer samuel goldwyn jr said the show must go on and it 
will 
the academy was denied a guild waiver to let writers finish the 
show 
about 125 east coast scriptwriters picketed outside the mgm 
building in new york city on wednesday it was the first protest by 
the eastern arm of the guild 
in the manhattan protest three writers of late night with

some rock climbers at hueco tanks state 
historical park have been gluing stones to the sheer rock walls to 
create handholds and footholds officials say 
the practice has forced a ban on rockclimbing while officials 
survey the damage and decide whether to allow climbers back on the 
rocks parks and wildlife department spokeswoman suzanne carter 
said wednesday 
hueco tanks was created to protect prehistoric rock drawings 
the area attracted people as long as 10000 years ago because of 
the water that collects in huecos or hollows in the granite 
rock formations 
the defaced walls were discovered in midfebruary and the park 
was closed indefinitely on march 1 to technical climbers who use 
ropes bolts and wedges climbers use the equipment at hueco tanks 
because some of the parks climbing routes are among the most 
challenging in north america 
bolts are screwed into stone to secure safety ropes the 
practice is banned at hueco tanks but park workers have struck an 
unofficial truce with climbers if climbers dont drill any more 
bolts the existing bolts wont be removed 
wedges are placed in cracks and also secure safety ropes they 
are supposed to be removable but some climbers apparently have 
been trying to make the wedges permanent 
they put a wedge in a crack then they will glue it into place 
with the epoxy glue if its not secure ms carter said 
even worse she said is evidence that some climbers have glued 
rocks to the rock faces to create handholds a practice that would 
shock most climbers who take pride in using nothing but chalk on 
their hands and softrubbersoled shoes to aid their ascents 
hueco tanks is about 25 miles east of el paso its brown cliffs 
were created after molten rock intruded into overlying limestone 
millions of years ago and the limestone eroded away some of the 
formations rise 150 feet

northwest airlines decision to impose a 
contract on its 6700 flight attendants has put the airline and the 
union on a collision course says a teamsters official 
the contract that the airline said it will impose april 1 is 
substantially the same as the proposal that negotiators fashioned 
in talks before the feb 26 strike deadline passed northwest said 
wednesday 
were not asking them to accept this theyve already rejected 
it were putting it into place said terry erskine the 
airlines vice president of law and labor relations 
erskine said the airline has not talked with the union about its 
plan to impose the contract but he said if attendants decide to 
strike the airline is prepared to hire permanent replacements 
theyre on a collision course and everybodys going to get 
hurt william genoese director of the teamsters airline division 
and the flight attendants chief negotiator told wccotv wednesday 
when asked what the chances of a strike next week are genoese 
said i would say theyre pretty close to 100 percent i would 
say unless somebody gets the people to the bargaining table the 
companys the one thats going to hurt itself 
teamsters have called a strategy meeting monday in washington 
dc for local union officers and strike captains at northwest he 
said 
the main obstacle to reaching a settlement between the airline 
and the flight attendants has been disagreement over how to raise 
lowerpaid bscale attendants to higher paid ascale wages 
northwest has proposed extending the bscale from five years to 
eight years meaning lowerwage flight attendants would have to 
wait an additional three years before earning topscale wages 
erskine said 
bscale flight attendants have said the airline is trying to 
break a promise that they would earn ascale wages after five years 
the union also has objected to twotier wage agreements saying 
they pit junior workers against senior workers 
the issue has intensified since northwest acquired republic 
airlines in 1986 roughly onethird of the 2600 former republic 
attendants work for bscale wages and the other twothirds have 
said they wouldnt get enough out of northwests latest wage offer 
under the contract proposal that will be implemented the 
entrylevel wage will go from more than 13000 a year to 15000 a 
year and the top base wage will go from the current 32000 up to 
35000 a year erskine said 
our door of course will always be open for further 
collective bargaining erskine said

and clear up the climate at the border he said the spokesman 
did not specify the alleged abuses 
in recent years international aid workers and organizations 
like the us lawyers committee for human rights have accused some 
khmer peoples national liberation front commanders of dispensing

banditry

the national assembly today 
unanimously reelected president suharto but a military general 
angrily protested the selection process for vice president in which 
a suharto aide is favored 
the peoples consultative assembly reelected suharto the only 
presidential candidate to a fifth fiveyear term suharto 66 has 
led the nation of 170 million people since 1967 his reelection 
indicates he is in firm control of the island republic and its 
400000member armed forces 
the 1000member assembly the nations highest policymaking 
body meets every five years to choose the president and vice 
president and issue new guidelines for state policy 
state secretary sudharmono one of suhartos most trusted aides 
was expected to be elected vice president on friday the 11th and 
final day of the assembly session sudharmono 61 chairs the 
governing golkar party 
military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
army was opposed to sudharmonos nomination and wanted the newly 
appointed armed forces commander gen try sutrisno 52 to fill 
the post 
the opposition moslem united development party nominated its 
chairman jailani nario 59 for vice president 
shortly after suhartos reelection a military general sprang 
to the podium to charge the selection process for vice president 
was unfair 
brig gen ibrahim saleh of the governmentnominated military 
faction grabbed the microphone at the podium and said 
we indonesian soldiers who believe in god and defend honesty 
and justice have heard rumors saying that the nomination of the 
vice president is not being fairly and correctly carried out 
saleh said there are certain things that we feel are against 
our conscience he did not elaborate 
saleh was shouted down and later taken away by fellow officers 
and wang suwandi secretarygeneral of the national assembly 
later the commander of the powerful national security agency 
gen benny murdani told reporters that salehs statement did not 
represent the official view of the armed forces and that he was 
speaking for himself 
suharto was not present during the session 
suharto came to power following a 1965 communist coup attempt in 
which six army generals were killed before the challenge was 
smashed by forces he then led as commander of the army strategic 
command 
suharto is expected to form a new cabinet later this month that 
will have to tackle urgent problems of economic development 
including how to cope with a 421 billion foreign debt 
indonesias economy was hit hard in the last five years by 
economic recession and a sharp drop in the price of oil a major 
foreign exchange earner the country has to set aside 64 billion 
nearly a third of its annual budget to pay its loan 
installments for the fiscal year beginning in april 
the peoples consultative assembly is comprised of a 500member 
parliament and 500 provincial and district officials 
in elections last april the golkar party won 299 seats in 
parliament which also has 100 governmentnominated members from 
the military the moslem united development party has 63 seats and 
the indonesian democratic party 38 seats 
in the assembly golkar has 548 seats as well as 151 
governmentnominated members from the military and 147 from the 
provinces the moslem united development party has 93 and the 
indonesian democratic party 61

experts testifying about possible causes of 
a continental airliner crash did not rule out disturbance from a 
plane landing on an adjacent runway but said winds could have 
swept away any such effect 
turbulent winds lead to the early demise of vortex said 
james hallock who has studied the air currents caused by plane 
landings for the department of transportation 
hallock testified wednesday during the second day of a national 
transportation safety board hearing into the nov 15 crash of 
continental flight 1713 which killed 28 people and injured 54 at 
denvers stapleton international airport 
george greene of the national aeronautics and space 
administrations langley research center who also has studied 
vortex agreed that winds generally diminish the effect of such 
turbulence 
federal aviation administration officials tried to elicit from 
greene a definite statement on whether vortex caused the stapleton 
crash but ntsb board member joseph t nall chairman of the 
inquiry would not allow him to answer 
nall said conclusions about what caused the crash must be made 
by the ntsb when it completes its investigation a final report is 
not expected until later this year 
continental spokesman bruce hicks said the witnesses testimony 
did not mean vortex should be ruled out as a possible cause 
nobody shot down anything today he said 
earlier wednesday an airplane engineer testified that enough 
snow fell during the 24 minutes that continental 1713 awaited 
takeoff for ice buildup on the wings to have been a possible factor 
in the crash 
continental officials said they believe wing icing can be ruled 
out as a factor because the plane exceeded the speed at which it 
likely would have stalled from ice 
ralph brumby manager of aerodynamics and acoustics for 
mcdonnell douglas corp which manufactured the dc9 said 0032 
inches of precipitation or about onethird of an inch of snow 
fell in the 24 minutes between deicing and takeoff 
if all that snow turned to ice on the wings the dc9 could have 
stalled after takeoff brumby said ice can change the shape of a 
wing affecting lift 
brumby under questioning by continental officials said that 
the amount of precipitation that fell between the time the plane 
was deiced and takeoff was enough to cause the plane to stall at 
about 150 knots or a little more than 170 mph 
but he said it was impossible to draw a definite conclusion that 
ice on the wing was a factor based on the theory that all the snow 
had turned to ice 
there are so many open parameters he said we dont know 
the amount of roughness generated by the water collection 
he also said officials do not know how long the deicing fluid 
was able to prevent buildup before the plane took off

at least 19 people were reported killed 
in punjab state today and wednesday despite government efforts to 
give militant sikhs a freer hand in trying to resolve the regions 
problems 
sikh gunmen killed three sikh policemen standing guard outside a 
high school where examinations were under way today in the village 
of dari wala amritsar district police chief mohammed izhar alam 
said 
he said the four gunmen who used chinesemade ak47 assault 
rifles arrived and fled on a tractor 
two people were killed in the village of mehsampura early today 
when sikh gunmen sprayed the sleeping village with gunfire the 
united news of india reported the identity of the victims was not 
immediately available 
dari wala and mehsampura are near the town of mehta about 25 
miles east of amritsar 
on wednesday seven people were killed by sikh extremists in the 
amritsar district seven other deaths were reported in the state 
including police slayings of two suspected extremists in shootouts 
the deaths came as militant sikhs on wednesday installed jasbir 
singh rode as chief priest at the golden temple in amritsar 
sikhisms holiest shrine 
on friday the government released rode who had been held since 
1985 on accusations of sedition but never tried on sunday the 
government said it was dissolving the punjab state assembly which 
had been controlled by a moderate sikh party 
both moves were seen as an effort by prime minister rajiv 
gandhis administration to try to involve militant leaders in 
bringing an end to the increasing violence in punjab state 
the latest killings raised to at least 417 the number of people 
killed in attacks blamed on sikh extremists since the start of the 
year 
last year more than 1000 people died in sikh attacks in the 
state 
most of the victims have been hindus or moderate sikhs 
sikhs whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam claim they are discriminated 
against by indias majority hindus sikhs make up less than 2 
percent of indias population but are a majority in punjab hindus 
are more than 80 percent 
sikh extremists have been agitating for more political autonomy 
or an independent state since 1982

the author of a letter from democrats on the 
house judiciary committee calling for the temporary resignation of 
attorney general edwin meese iii said today there is considerable 
sentiment for even harsher action against meese 
a republican on the committee however called the letter an 
outrageous political move and a meese spokesman said the 
attorney general would not comply 
meanwhile swiss oilman bruce rappaport has testified under oath 
before independent counsel james mckay in the criminal 
investigation involving meese and a proposed 1 billion iraqi 
pipeline project according to sources familiar with the probe 
eleven democrats on the judiciary committee called wednesday for 
meese to step down until that and other independent counsel 
investigations into meeses conduct are completed 
rep edward feighan of ohio who was introduced as the letters 
author on cbs this morning said the committee members did not 
specifically consider impeachment of meese but there was 
considerable sentiment for even harsher action than the letter we 
sent he did not say what other steps might be taken 
feighan said that although no republicans on the committee 
signed the letter meese had become a major embarrassment to 
his party he also said morale was low in the justice department 
which meese heads 
rep william mccollum rfla also interviewed on cbs noted 
that meese has been cleared every time he has been investigated 
this is an outrageous political move on the part of some 
democrats in a political year he said mccollum denied that 
morale was low in the justice department 
the pervasive perception that you have allowed personal 
considerations to encroach on your constitutional responsibilities 
threatens to breed contempt for your office your administration 
and the rule of law itself the letter said 
justice department spokesman terry eastland said the letter 
proposed a politically partisan idea and a thoroughly bad idea 
he said meese has every intention of serving to the end of 
this term he has spent some time with his lawyers on the 
investigation but there has been no serious subtraction of his 
time or effort from leadership of the department of justice 
mckay and his deputy carole bruce took the statements from 
rappaport in london on tuesday said the sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity mckay has granted immunity from prosecution 
to rappaport 
meeses former chief of staff john richardson who left the 
justice department several months ago also testified separately 
tuesday afternoon before the federal grand jury in washington which 
is receiving evidence from mckays office 
richardson who has joined a richmond va law firm declined 
on wednesday to discuss his testimony 
the independent counsel is investigating whether meese may have 
violated the foreign corrupt practices act which prohibits paying 
bribes to foreign officials by us companies and authorizes the 
attorney general to intervene to block them 
the investigation stems from a 1985 memo to the attorney general 
from his longtime friend e robert wallach who had been hired as 
legal counsel by rappaport to help secure us support on the 
pipeline project 
wallachs memo says that payments were planned to the israeli 
labor party in connection with the pipeline rappaport a partner 
in the proposed pipeline has denied that any such payments to the 
labor party were contemplated 
meese has said he doesnt recall reading the portion of the memo 
mentioning planned payments to the labor party 
rappaport was brought into the project because of his close ties 
to thenisraeli prime minister shimon peres to aid in getting 
assurances for the iraqi government that israel would not attack 
the pipeline 
the pipeline was never built but was to have been constructed by 
the san franciscobased bechtel group inc 
mckays investigation of meese which began last may 11 has 
delved into meeses involvement with scandalplagued wedtech corp 
and the regional bell telephone companies as well as with the 
pipeline project

low doses of an anticancer drug may help people 
with severe asthma reduce their need for harmful amounts of 
cortisone a study published today suggests 
despite the promising results however experts cautioned that 
more study is needed to test the longterm effects of the therapy 
before it is used routinely 
in the study published in the new england journal of medicine 
doctors gave the drug methotrexate to 14 people with severe 
bronchial asthma while they took the drug they were able to 
reduce their use of prednisone an artificial form of cortisone by 
36 percent 
an estimated 5 percent to 7 percent of americans have asthma a 
small minority of these people require daily doses of steroid drugs 
so they can breathe prednisone is among the most common of these 
medications 
however longterm use of high doses of prednisone can lead to 
obesity cataracts and weakening of the bones among other things 
dr michael f mullarkey of virginia mason clinic in seattle 
tested methotrexate as an alternative to prednisone for relieving 
inflammation an underlying cause of asthma 
they found preliminary evidence that methotrexate works but 
they cautioned longer and larger studies are needed to define 
the ultimate benefits and risks associated with the use of 
methotrexate in severe asthma 
in an accompanying editorial drs gary r cott and reuben m 
cherniack of the university of colorado agreed with that warning 
many questions remain to be answered before lowdose 
methotrexate therapy should be considered as more than an 
experimental form of treatment for steroiddependent asthma they 
wrote 
the seattle doctors stopped their study earlier than planned 
because of the dramatic effects of treatment with methotrexate 
nine patients continued to take methotrexate after the study was 
formally halted and four of them have completely stopped taking 
prednisone 
four patients suffered mild nausea for several hours after 
taking methotrexate this problem went away within a few weeks in 
all but one of them 
besides its use in cancer treatment methotrexate also is given 
to psoriasis and arthritis sufferers

a measure designed to put a gambling casino 
on alcatraz island once the site of a federal prison that housed 
some of the nations most notorious criminals has been approved 
for the city ballot 
id never turn my back on something that would bring money to 
the city legally said supervisor wendy nelder one of six city 
supervisors who voted wednesday to put the advisory measure on the 
june 7 ballot 
the measure asks whether the city should encourage changes in 
state and federal law to allow a gambling resort on alcatraz for 
29 years a prison for for 1576 criminals who included al capone 
and george machine gun kelly 
the prison that was dubbed the rock was closed in 1963 when 
attorney general robert kennedy called the facility inhumane 
it isnt the first time a casino has been suggested for the 
island 
in 1969 more than 300 recommendations were submitted to mayor 
joseph alioto about the future of the island in san francisco bay 
suggestions included a casino a home for hippies and a site for 
a replica of the eiffel tower alioto favored a giant monument 
symbolizing justice on the outcropping a mile off fishermans 
wharf that would be a west coast counterpart to the statue of 
liberty in the new york harbor 
the latest casino plan stemmed from a luncheon meeting tuesday 
of labor leaders city supervisors and warren hinckle a san 
francisco examiner columnist who made an unsuccesful bid for mayor 
the casino complex could bring in at least 150 million a year 
to help san francisco solve a projected budget deficit said 
hinckle whose plan would include a tunnel under the bay to the 
casinos 
the state constitution would need to be changed by voters to 
exempt the island from state laws that forbid gambling hinckle 
said 
the federal government would also have to be petitioned to 
remove alcatraz from the golden gate recreation area which covers 
vast stretches of federal open space on both sides of the golden 
gate bridge federal officials would then have to sell the island 
to san francisco 
hundreds of tourists visit alcatraz each year for a guided tour 
of the island that is conducted by park rangers

a cargo plane flying erratically dove into 
a residential area struck a garage and a house and exploded early 
today killing a couple in the house and the pilot officials said 
the couples three children who were sleeping in an upstairs 
bedroom were unhurt and were led to safety by neighbors said 
herbert kauffman assistant police chief for this detroit suburb 
the twinengine beechcraft plane had just taken off from detroit 
city airport not the citys main airport about 1230 am when it 
went into a nosedive and struck a garage propelling a van into the 
firstfloor bedroom of the house next door before crashing into 
that house and bursting into flames said police lt orba underwood 
there are parts of the aircraft and car inside the bedroom 
underwood said 
the plane was seen faltering in the air by two warren scout 
cars and they were literally on the scene immediately after 
impact mayor ron bonkowski said they thought at first he 
might have hit the school playground on the other street you look 
another 60 feet and hed have been in the street 
kauffman said police officers craig garwood and alex sywak saw 
the airplane shortly before it crashed 
the aircraft appeared to be flying lower than normal and was 
ascending and descending erratically kauffman said quoting a 
report by the officers it disappeared out of sight and seconds 
later they saw a fire flash 
kauffman identified the victims as norma and harold richardson 
both 29 their neighbor whose garage was struck was unharmed but 
her house was damaged by flames 
the airplane loaded with automobile axles was flying from 
detroit to fort wayne ind kauffman said it crashed about five 
miles northwest of city airport which is northeast of downtown 
detroit the pilot thomas bussard of pontiac was the only person 
aboard 
kauffman said officials at lafayette aviation at the 
oaklandpontiac airport confirmed the airplane was theirs a man 
who did not identify himself answered the telephone at the company 
and declined comment 
it took firefighters about 45 minutes to put out the blaze that 
engulfed the twostory house and damaged the onestory house and 
garage next door in this macomb county community bonkowski said 
doug stockel ran across the street and was met at the front door 
by another neighbor who kicked down the front door 
the kids were already downstairs screaming he took the kids 
out i checked the upstairs somebody had to go upstairs to make 
sure there was nobody up there stockel said 
as im thinking about it with the gas mains in back that 
house could have exploded right there we could have opened that 
front door and the flames could have nailed us stockel said 
the thing is that was only done on an impulse 
the children randi 9 erin 5 and debra 4 were taken to 
grandparents in warren 
don hunt said he was in his house two doors away from the 
victims home when he heard the explosion 
we were just getting ready for bed he said one minute i 
hear a real loud roar coming in like a lowflying plane and then 
real fast this is too loud this is too low and crash and 
flames and everything so you could tell right away it was a plane 
at first i thought it could have been a helicopter going by 
like a police helicopter but then it was the wrong kind of sound 
it was coming in too fast like something dropping fast 
kauffman said the area surrounding the crash site was sealed off 
and officials from the federal aviation administration and the 
national transportation safety board were at the scene 
investigating

a police squad leader accused 
by fellow officers of ordering the execution of a black youth 
testified that he was drunk at the time and had assaulted the 
victim 
warrant officer leon de villers 36 concluded his testimony 
wednesday after six days on the stand during a trial that began in 
october 
the trial is unusual because it focuses on testimony by 
policemen against their fellow officers five members of the 
allwhite 10member unit have alleged that de villiers and his 
codefendant constable david goosen were responsible for the 
execution and a fatal stabbing that occurred a few hours earlier 
de villiers and goosen are charged with murder in both deaths 
according to the five officers goosen stabbed one black man 
andile plaatjie 45 during an unauthorized foot patrol and later 
shot 18yearold mlungisi stuurman in the head after being told by 
de villiers that the badly beaten youth should be taken out 
de villiers and goosen contended that stuurman was shot 
accidentally after being taken to a riverside to wash off blood 
from injuries inflicted when officers assaulted him 
de villiers testified that he had drunk most of a bottle of 
brandy shortly before his units two forays into the black section 
of the cape province town of cradock in july 26 1986 other 
members of the unit also drank heavily according to testimony and 
engaged in a bloodoath ceremony in which they swore to keep 
secrets 
de villiers said he was too drunk to accompany his men during 
the predawn foot patrol when the stabbing allegedly occurred 
during the second foray de villiers said he lost his temper 
because stuurman refused to answer questions hit the youth and 
then stood by as other members of the unit beat and kicked him 
de villiers said he decided not to report the subsequent 
shooting of stuurman because he was shocked and under the 
influence of alcohol 
he said he could not explain why if the shooting was 
accidental five members of the unit alleged it was deliberate 
in separate developments 
the new nation a blackoriented weekly newspaper reported 
thursday that a black activist was abducted from his home near 
johannesburg by eight white soldiers last month taken to a 
cemetery and interrogated while lying on a grave with a gun 
pressed to his neck police and military spokesmen said the 
allegation was under investigation 
a johannesburg police sergeant on trial for murder testified 
wednesday that he was ordered by his codefendant a police 
captain to kill three men last year two of the men were shot dead 
and one was injured 
sgt robert van der merwe said he carried out the assignment 
after capt jack la grange told him the three targets were working 
for the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement 
testimony in the trial has indicated the murders were related to 
drug smuggling and had no connection to the anc

gallaudet universitys new president told by 
an influential congressman she may have no choice but to step down 
said today she will meet with instructors and students who oppose 
her appointment as the head of the nations only university for the 
deaf 
the congressman rep david bonior dmich said he told dr 
elisabeth zinser the schools new president on wednesday that 
federal aid for the school may be jeopardized if she refuses to 
leave the post 
theres a variety of scenarios and thats one bonior told 
the washington post afterward i prefer that she make the 
decision through a period of meeting with students and faculty and 
arrive at a decision thats best for the university 
zinser later acknowledged to an interviewer that a very strong 
signal is being sent to me to resign but im not sure thats 
uniform 
her selection has been opposed by students instructors and 
alumni who contend it is time for gallaudet to have a deaf 
president zinser hears normally and does not know sign language 
interviewed today on abctvs good morning america zinser 
said my deepest concern is to see the university continue its 
good work and get back to educating students and carrying out its 
research mission 
today is the day in which im going to attempt to establish 
the communication that is needed with the students and the faculty 
my concern at this stage is that as president of the 
university that i exercise the leadership to get the university 
back to business and engaged in the good work that it is doing 
but such talks are doomed said the president of the national 
association for the deaf 
gary olsen himself a graduate of gallaudet said on the abctv 
program that theres no way there will be an open dialogue 
amongst the faculty staff and students with her if she wants 
business to continue then she should really be honest about it and 
back down 
the appointment of zinser who has been chanceollor of the 
university of north carolina at greensboro was announced sunday 
night protests closed the university monday boycotts left 
classrooms empty tuesday and wednesday 
protest leaders had said they were considering a mass student 
withdrawal today but one leader tim rarus said this morning 
weve decided not to do that we would lose our leverage 
one deaf student said the protests recall the classic civil 
rights demonstrations of the 1960s 
this is the selma of the deaf gallaudet graduate student 
kathy karcher said at a rally wednesday referring to the alabama 
city where civil rights demonstrators were bloodied by 
clubwielding police 23 years ago this is a very important 
moment 
protest leaders say demonstrations will continue until zinser is 
replaced they are also demanding the replacement of jane bassett 
spilman the chairwoman of the board of trustees and the 
implementation of a plan to make deaf people a majority on the 
schools 20member board of trustees the board has just four deaf 
members 
the gallaudet protesters have encountered none of the violence 
of the selma demonstrators but they say their struggle is akin to 
the trials endured by blacks in their fight for equality 
on wednesday more than half of gallaudets 274member faculty 
attended a meeting and voted overwhelmingly to ask the schools 
board of trustees to oust spilman the faculty group also endorsed 
the students demands 
those are the people i think who are really deaf deaf 
actress marlee matlin said on nightline referring to 
gallaudets board of trustees matlin won a 1986 academy award for 
her performance as a dropout from a school for the deaf in 
children of a lesser god 
gallaudet was founded by an act of congress in 1864 and 
receives threequarters of its 76 million annual budget in federal 
funds

uncovered new details about events during the four days she claims 
she was abducted and sexually abused but they are still uncertain 
exactly what happened according to a report published today 
in a related development child protection officials are 
investigating whether miss brawleys welfare has been endangered 
since she was whisked into seclusion by the rev al sharpton 
according to another report 
miss brawley who was 15 at the time she disappeared for four 
days starting last nov 24 has said she was held in a wooded area 
and sexually abused by at least two and as many as six white men 
one of whom flashed a policetype badge she was found in a plastic 
bag with racial slurs scrawled on her body and smeared with animal 
feces 
gov mario cuomo appointed robert abrams state attorney 
general as special prosecutor but sharpton and miss brawleys 
attorneys c vernon mason and alton maddox have withheld her 
cooperation from the investigators 
todays new york times reported that interviews with witnesses 
indicated that 
miss brawley made an abrupt decision to get off a bus near her 
home in wappingers falls which apparently ruled out the 
possibility that someone deliberately ambushed her 
investigators found traces of marijuana and hashish in an 
apartment near where she was found and that her family had recently 
been evicted from the denim jacket she was wearing when she 
disappeared was also found there and had traces of the drugs in it 
but tests performed on miss brawley showed no signs of drug use 
just before she was found her mother went into the apartment 
to look for her although she found no one she said she suspected 
someone had been there because the heat was turned on a local 
investigator who entered the apartment described it as 
blisteringly hot 
a charcoal substance that might have been used to write racial 
slurs on miss brawleys body was found on leather gloves underneath 
the garbage bag 
dog feces were found inside and outside her clothing 
suggesting to investigators that she might have been naked when 
they got on her the yard of the apartment was littered with such 
feces 
in addition more evidence has surfaced indicating that miss 
brawley spent at least part of the four days around the apartment 
according to the times 
on wednesday child protection officials began investigating 
whether miss brawley has suffered emotional and educational 
neglect insufficient psychiatric and medical care and inadequate 
supervision according to a report in todays daily news 
a possible neglect complaint was filed last week by 
79yearold conrad lynn chief counsel of the midhudson region of 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
wappingers falls is 50 miles north of new york city 
but matthew strong miss brawleys uncle and legal guardian

a woman who apparently was part of a crowd 
that grabbed more than 700000 that fell from an armored truck has 
had a change of heart and turned in 28000 police said 
she said she picked up the money and then got kind of scared 
so she decided to turn it in sgt william herndon said late 
wednesday 
the woman identified only as a 30yearold postal worker gave 
police two clear plastic bags containing a total of 28000 
wednesday more than 24 hours after a crate filled with money fell 
from the back of a loomis armored inc truck 
however most of the estimated 771000 that was in the crate is 
still missing and police warned opportunists they could face 
felony theft charges if they dont return the cash 
the woman who may have been the one seen throwing money bags 
into her car and driving away could be charged with failure to 
return property to its lawful owner a misdemeanor herndon said 
she was interviewed by police 
since talking with the woman police think more people than they 
originally believed were involved snatched the estimated 20 bags 
still missing on tuesday they thought only three to five people 
took advantage of loomis misfortune 
she did say there were so many people picking up sacks 
that she didnt believe it herndon said it makes sense 
because when we interviewed people at the scene no one knew 
anything 
one man at the scene television repairman luis lopez managed 
to save two bags containing 20050 each and took them straight to 
loomis nearby offices 
investigators were working to trace license plate numbers and 
vehicle descriptions reported by witnesses and trying to compile a 
list of the lost bills serial numbers 
a spokesman for oaklandbased loomis declined comment on the 
incident 
the armored truck carrying more than 17 million collected 
from 20 banks in the san francisco bay area was headed for loomis 
offices from downtown 
lt barry johnson said the driver claimed the rear door had been 
locked but that a dolly containing a crate of bills slammed 
against the door and forced it open 
the driver whose name was not disclosed did not learn of the 
mishap until a honking motorist pointed it out two blocks away 
police described him as white as a ghost and real upset 
before the driver could return a crowd gathered around the 
fallen bags some people put money back into the crate but others 
hung onto it including one man who witnesses said tossed numerous 
bags into his pickup truck and drove off 
police declined to be specific wednesday about the amount 
involved saying only that it was more than 500000 the san 
francisco examiner reported that 771000 in 10 20 and 50 bills 
fell out of the truck while close to 1 million remained inside

soldiers shot and wounded 
three palestinians today in a predawn riot that arabs said was 
started by jewish settlers who shot at arab homes and vandalized 
their cars 
jewish settlers said the clash began after they were awakened by 
arab rioters shouting slaughter the jews and god is great 
fearing the arabs wanted to attack their homes some settlers said 
they rushed into the streets of hebron and fired warning shots 
the army said the violence by arabs was aimed only at the 
military 
arab residents said they were awakened at about midnight by 
carloads of settlers raiding their neighborhoods 
all the city was sleeping nobody was in the streets 
mustafa natsche the former mayor told the associated press it 
was a dreadful night there was a sort of battle under the windows 
of my house shooting crying moaning 
he said the arabs responded to the attack by throwing rocks at 
the settlers and israeli troops who arrived 
but rabbi moshe levinger told the ap they the arabs ran 
down near the synagogue they wanted to enter jewish homes they 
carried stones we responded by throwing stones and firing in the 
air 
the area military commander disputed levingers claim 
its important to stress that the riots were directed at the 
army and at no stage was there an intention or attempt to attack 
jewish homes the commander said on israel radio he did not give 
his name in keeping with military regulations 
an ap reporter saw dozens of vandalized arab cars including a 
station wagon with all its windows broken arab residents showed 
several revolver cartridges they collected after the clash and said 
they turned over nearly 100 to the israeli authorities as evidence 
levinger who has lived in hebron nine years is one of the 
founders of the 40family beit hadassah settlement inside the 
predominantly arab city of 50000 there is a second jewish enclave 
in hebron the hillside neighborhood of tel rumayda 
levinger claimed 500 arabs were involved in the rioting and came 
to within about 100 yards of jewish homes he said about 50 
settlers defended the homes 
if we hadnt stopped them there would have been a 
slaughter of jews men women and children levinger said 
but natsche and other arab witnesses said the clashes occured 
without provocation in arab neighborhoods several miles from jewish 
homes 
natsche pointed to the smashed windows and slit tires of his car 
parked outside his home about one mile from the jewish settlements 
army spokesmen said 20 to 30 arabs were involved in each of 
three disturbances in hebron they said the arabs erected stone 
barricades set tires ablaze and threw rocks 
according to the army account the unrest began about 11 pm 
wednesday and lasted until about 3 am at one point a jeep with 
soldiers was trapped by the rioters the army said 
in the course of the riots the lives of the soldiers were 
endangered and they were forced to shoot the area commander 
said 
three arabs were lightly wounded in the legs by army gunfire 
and two women were taken to a hospital suffering the effects of 
tear gas he said 
the army said one arab car was set ablaze but that the unrest 
was instigated by palestinian rioters not jewish settlers 
the arabrun palestine press service said israelis from the 
nearby kiryat arba settlement started to smash car windows about 
midnight and arab residents went outside to see what was happening 
the first arabs to go outside were beaten by settlers said the 
agency 
on wednesday defense minister yitzhak rabin said the armys 
efforts to curb three months of palestinian unrest have been 
hampered by the presence of jewish settlements in the occupied 
lands 
also wednesday the 10member inner cabinet refused to endorse a 
us peace plan designed to end the violence in which at least 87 
palestinians have been killed since dec 8 
rabin speaking on israel television said the presence of 
jewish settlers made it difficult for israeli soldiers to put down 
the unrest 
the problem could have been simpler if the whole territory was 
arab without jewish settlements it would have been very easy to 
close it and not to deal with the problem of roads he said

the navy has pulled the plug on helping 
production of the abctv supercarrier series saying the show 
inaccurately portrays the lives of the crew and officers on a 
fictional aircraft carrier 
after lengthy deliberations the navy determined that the 
scripts for supercarrier did not accurately portray the navy and 
its people therefore cooperation was withdrawn a navy spokesman 
said 
navy officials declined to comment on specific plot summaries 
that prompted concern but one reportedly involved a tale about 
gunrunning military action in central america 
navy spokesman capt michael sherman said abc could regain the 
navys support if future scripts are in line with navy interests 
show producer charles fries said i think theyre in a 
waitandsee mode 
the show likened to the movie top gun with its hard rock 
sound track and f14 jet fighters premiered sunday with a 
90minute movie and took a 130 rating and 19 percent audience 
share it will be broadcast at 8 pm sundays over the next seven 
weeks 
fries said the show at first was planned to focus on the lives 
of the men and women aboard the carrier but then shifted to 
actionadventure 
from that point on the navy became more and more disenchanted 
because essentially theyre concerned about their perception by 
the public he said 
right now the navy is in a peacetime mode but to do an 
actionadventure show we had to get off the carrier and bring in 
some conflict and jeopardy 
two episodes remain to be shot and fries said he had ample 
shipboard footage left to continue production without navy help 
the navy charged fries company 50000 for the use of navy 
personnel planes and facilities for the scenes that have been shot 
so far 
the show is loosely based on the bestselling nonfiction book 
of the same name by george wilson a washington post reporter 
i was kind of distressed that they didnt get it a little more 
realistic in terms of what really goes on out there said wilson 
who said one admiral told him you ought to sue abc for not 
plagiarizing your book

doctors used a laser in clearing a 
womans clogged coronary artery but cautioned that there was no 
evidence that the beam of energy cleared away the fatty despoits 
we put a fiber down there we gave it energy and we did it 
safely dr leonard nordstrom said wednesday of the procedure 
performed at methodist hospital 
doctors performed the procedure tuesday on a 38yearold woman 
whose right coronary artery was 90 percent clogged 
i dont want to overstate what weve done nordstrom 
stressed at a news conference i think in cases to come well 
have good documentation that we have removed tissue 
nordstrom said he stopped the nonsurgical laser procedure and 
inflated a balloon to enlarge the vessel opening before there was 
evidence that the laser had removed any tissue clogging the artery 
lasers have been used previously during openheart surgery he 
said janis konze said she had no second thoughts about being the 
first patient to undergo the new procedure 
everything went fine said konze who said she first 
experienced heart pain last summer and consulted with a doctor 
about a month ago 
i feel wonderful im anxious to go home konze said before 
her release wednesday i expect to be back to work within a 
week 
in the procedure a speciallydesigned catheter or slender tube 
is inserted into a patients arterial system and guided to a 
position in the coronary artery where a direct beam of laser energy 
is directed at the blockage 
then the catheter is moved forward to position the balloon in 
the newly enlarged opening the physician inflates the balloon and 
spreads the remaining blockage apart to reopen circulation through 
the artery 
the hourlong procedure during which nordstrom used onesecond 
bursts of laser energy for two to three minutes was the first 
coronary application of the system developed by gv medical inc of 
plymouth 
gvs lastac system is the first integrated system that combines 
the use of direct laser energy fiberoptics and balloon angioplasty 
catheters the company said 
the procedure was pioneered on larger leg arteries more than 
130 procedures have been performed on leg arteries since may 1986 
and the system is now in use at 17 sites around the world gv said 
in a statement 
with the leg arteries the initial success rate was better 
than 90 percent with a success percentage rate in the mid 70s on 
keeping the vessels open james grabek gv president and chief 
executive officer told reporters 
the us food and drug administration has given permission for 
10 test coronary procedures to be done nordstrom said findings 
from these clinical studies will be reviewed by the fda before 
approval is granted for additional procedures or for procedures to 
be done at other sites he said

a judge says he sentenced two rabbis and the 
wife of one of the men to prison because they reaped millions 
as part of a 130 million garment industry tax fraud in which more 
than 200 companies participated 
but us district judge john m walker said wednesday he took 
into account a lengthy appeal for leniency by lawyers for the three 
defendants all members of the ultrareligious lubavitch sect of 
judaism and active in their brooklyn community 
the three were convicted dec 4 of one count of conspiracy and 
44 counts of aiding and assisting the filing of false federal tax 
returns 
rabbi schnejer zalman gurary 76 who walker called the 
kingpin of the scheme was sentenced to three years in prison 
and five years on probation and was fined 2 million 
you reaped millions walker told him the sentence would 
have been stiffer but for gurarys failing health and a thick file 
of letters attesting to gurarys good community deeds walker said 
gurarys soninlaw nochum sternberg 43 was sentenced to 18 
months in prison and five years on probation his wife esther 
sternberg 43 gurarys daughter was sentenced to 120 days in jail 
and five years on probation 
the sternbergs also were fined 1 million 
they faced up to five years on the conspiracy count and three 
years in prison on each of the 44 aiding and assisting counts 
the sternbergs have 11 children four of whom still live at 
home and walker said sternberg was not to begin serving his prison 
sentence until his wife had completed hers 
the judge also accommodated the womans strong religious beliefs 
by allowing her to leave jail each week for the jewish sabbath 
during the sixweek trial the government said the scheme 
involved phony invoices from a group of 36 companies known 
collectively as the zalga companies 
the defendants sold phony zalga invoices primarily to companies 
in the garment center indicating that goods had been purchased 
when in fact no goods were involved 
the garment company would then issue a check to the zalga 
company issuing the phony invoice the defendants then returned 
cash to the company keeping 10 percent to 15 percent of the amount 
of the check as a commission 
representatives of the other companies a number of whom 
testified against the three were sentenced earlier on various tax 
fraud charges 
according to trial testimony the defendants issued more than 
130 million in fraudulent invoices to more than 200 companies 
between 1979 and 1986

a lyndon larouche associate says he will assume 
the traditional duties of harris county democratic party chairman 
the office he won in an upset 
party leaders meanwhile said wednesday they are taking steps 
to thwart claude jones influence 
jones an associate of the political extremist threw the 
democratic party into turmoil tuesday when he narrowly defeated 
incumbent larry veselka in the primary jones received 54394 
votes or 5146 percent to veselkas 51318 votes or 4855 
percent 
the result shocked party leaders who face working under a 
chairman associated since 1975 with a fringe presidential candidate 
strongly opposed by the national and state party 
members of the partys steering committee met wednesday night to 
consider a plan by which the party executive committee would 
empower the party secretary to run the party rather than jones who 
takes office may 2 the 664member executive committee is made up 
of elected precinct chairmen 
former county party chairman barbara stanley who attended the 
meeting said state law places most of the partys power with the 
committee rather than the chairman who has no inherent power 
party leaders wont challenge jones right to hold the office 
she said adding she presumes they will not try to stop him from 
conducting three legally required county party executive committee 
meetings during his term 
jones said he desires to work with the party help register 
voters and defeat the republicans particularly george bush whom 
he described as the likely nominee 
larouche associate harley schlanger appearing with jones 
asked do the leaders of the democratic party have a right to 
tell the voters who their party chairman will be 
jones dismissed as a silly question an inquiry about 
analysts views that jones common name and the obscurity of the 
race accounted for his win 
he won he said because he has been working hard pushing 
larouches issues and those issues finally hit a nerve 
democratic national committee member billie carr of houston said 
jones was elected because the voters didnt know of his association 
with larouche she said she doesnt blame veselka who didnt 
campaign for reelection and was out of the city in the weeks 
before the campaign 
jones who was defeated by veselka in 1986 said his sole 
occupation is working for larouche he said he staffs solicitation 
booths the larouche organization sponsors at airports and other 
public places 
jones said he will back the democratic presidential nominee 
although he supports larouche 
larouche has accused queen elizabeth of drug trafficking and 
espouses a quarantine of aids patients 
one person happy about the flap was texas republican chairman 
george strake 
i wish them the democrats every success under their new 
leadership he said wednesday

three intelligence operatives said fbi and cia 
officials asked them to infiltrate the political organizations of 
extremist lyndon larouche a declassified document shows 
the document was made available wednesday to defense lawyers in 
the fraud and conspiracy trial of larouche six aides and five of 
his political groups 
the defense which claims the criminal charges emerged from a 
white housedirected plot to ruin larouche won a delay in the 
trial as a result of the document and a previously disclosed memo 
indicating two key players in the irancontra scandal discussed 
collecting evidence against larouche 
a federal judge ordered the prosecutor to search government 
files for any additional evidence that should be surrendered to 
defense lawyers 
in a separate decision a federal appeals court ruled wednesday 
that nbc must surrender to a judge outtakes from a 100minute 
interview with a former larouche consultant who said an aide to the 
political extremist discussed a plot to assassinate henry 
kissinger the network broadcast a oneminute excerpt of the 
interview in april 1986 
the decision wednesday by the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
upheld a lower court order that videotape of the entire interview 
must be surrendered for possible use at the conspiracy and fraud 
trial 
the court also upheld a contempt citation against the network 
nbc had contended that surrendering portions of the interview 
that were not broadcast violated its first amendment right against 
judicial intrusion into news gathering and editorial decisions 
however us district judge robert e keeton ruled that the 
rights of the defendants to have access to the 100minute interview 
with forrest lee fick outweighed those of the network 
the prosecutor assistant us attorney john markham has at 
times ridiculed defense claims that larouche was a target of 
infiltration by the fbi and the cia which is prohibited by law 
from spying domestically the defense claims marine lt col oliver 
north the former national security council aide fired for his role 
in the irancontra affair directed the infiltration because 
larouche refused to support the nicaraguan rebels 
defense attorneys are seeking dismissal of charges on the ground 
that prosecutors deliberately withheld evidence that the defense 
later learned of through freedom of information act requests 
the fbi document declassified wednesday refers to gary howard 
and ron tucker founders of a private nowdefunct dallas company 
peregrine international associates 
peregrine reportedly was involved in an aborted attempt to sell 
arms to iranians who planned to assassinate their nations leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and helped train contra forces and 
elite military units in el salvador honduras and peru 
the document also refers to retired sgt maj fred lewis who 
defense lawyers in the larouche case say also worked for peregrine 
when asked about their possible ties to larouche they 
howard tucker and lewis claimed they had previously been 
requested by the fbi and cia to penetrate the larouche 
organization said the document 
lewis a former member of the armys elite special operations 
delta force was said by the fbi document to be an employee of 
rhyolite management systems of dallas rhyolite is the name of a 
spy satellite the government acknowledged several years ago

against larouche 
the defense lawyers said they have been informed by the 
government that the our man reference is to oliver revell an 
fbi assistant director involved in counterintelligence 
fbi spokesman ray mcelhaney said the agency would not comment on 
the memo during the trial 
this was an activity that was headed up by oliver north and 
mr secord in a political attempt to stop the larouche people

tucker a former texas department of public safety narcotics 
agent and howard a former border patrol agent claim in a lawsuit 
filed last summer against the customs service that they have been 
government informants since 1979 tucker and howard are seeking 
14 million for their expenses in a sting operation that led to 
the arrest of a man allegedly buying arms for iran 
they say the government backed off the case because it would 
have revealed the reagan administrations arms shipments to iran 
and the diversion of profits to the contras 
the fbi document also said that during interviews with fbi 
agents in san antonio and el paso tucker and howard said they had 
approached family and friends of soviet dissidents andrei sakharov

the couple from the soviet union for 2 million

this week austria marks the 50th 
anniversary of anschluss its annexation by nazi germany with 
soulsearching events likened by some to an exorcism 
the disclosure of president kurt waldheims world war ii service 
in the german army has coincided with a historical reckoning that 
forced many austrians to confront the nazi past they tried for 
decades to forget 
nobody wanted to talk about the past prominent austrian 
writer gerhard roth said in an interview waldheim forced it if 
waldheim hadnt come along this never would have happened 
there is a kind of exorcism going on at the moment said 
roth who has written extensively about austrian society for 
publications in his homeland and west germany 
it brings up a lot of filth with it but it is basically a 
cleansing process roth said acknowledging there have been 
outbursts of antisemitism since the waldheim controversy came to 
light two years ago 
waldheim interviewed on nbcs today said austria never 
tried to ignore its nazi past but rather concentrated on rebuilding 
the nation after the war 
this debate is right now coming on in connection with the 50th 
anniversary of that tragedy he said insisting again that he was 
innocent of war crimes 
chancellor franz vranitzky said the debate over waldheim should 
not distract austrians from the lessons to be learned from the past 
what we have to do is to think harder about the roots the 
political and societal roots of what happened in the 1930s which 
ended up in the tragic and dramatic events of 1938 he said 
the leader of viennas jewish community the citys socialist 
mayor and former concentration camp inmates were expected at the 
formal opening tonight of the gedenktage or days of 
remembrance 
events culminate friday with a memorial in parliament and 
another ceremony at the former imperial hofburg palace 
roth said many thousands of austrians of the war generation 
together with postwar babies educated by unrepentant nazis 
absorbed national socialist teachings that went unchallenged for 
decades 
now the nation is beginning to work the past out of its system 
dozens of plays films seminars exhibits books and a major 
television series are confronting austrians with rarely viewed 
pages of their history 
recurring images of throngs cheering adolf hitler or crowds 
ogling jews scrubbing vienna sidewalks contrast with many 
austrians view that their country was more a victim of hitler than 
an accomplice 
a highly praised primetime television series takes austrians 
back through the turbulent years from 1918 to 1938 when the small 
alpine nation struggled to come to terms with the loss of the 
hapsburg empire 
at viennas austrian film museum long lines form for tickets to 
a threeweek series of documentary films showing the days of the 
nazi anschluss the brutality of world war ii and the horrors of 
the concentration camps 
the burgtheater austrias most prestigious stage is presenting 
antinazi plays including one by bertolt brecht and a mock mein 
kampf by hungarianborn georg tabori to mark the nazi takeover 
in march 1938 
in graz a city that hoisted the nazi swastika on its town hall 
before hitler even sent in his troops an extensive exhibit probes 
what happened in the town 50 years ago 
in linz the city of hitlers youth that welcomed him as a 
returning hero in 1938 city fathers will mark the anniversary with 
a visit to the nearby former concentration camp of mauthausen to 
honor nazi victims 
another exhibit is being held in salzburg and two vienna 
museums have exhibits tracing the history of the citys jews a 
thriving intellectual community of 200000 before the war and now 
numbering just 6000 
the austrian students union representing 170000 students 
received 833000 from chancellor franz vranitzkys office to 
finance a program to confront people born in the 1960s with a past 
most of their parents and grandparents rarely discussed 
the controversy over waldheims wartime past plagued both 
events forcing waldheim to drop plans to speak at fridays 
ceremonies instead he delivered an address on television 
waldheims inability to play a leading part in events marking 
the anschluss illustrates the deep division among austrians over 
both the president and the nations past 
as austrians mull over their history debate has intensified 
over a historians report that questioned waldheims integrity 
the report published feb 9 said he covered up his service as 
a lieutenant with the german army in the balkans where he knew 
about nazi atrocities and did nothing to prevent them 
the report and waldheims calm initial response that knowledge 
is not a crime and that he was not a war criminal has triggered 
fierce debate throughout austria 
barely a television program goes by without some reference to 
the controversy or to its damaging effect on austrias image 
abroad many people say the divisions caused by waldheim are an 
uncomfortably close reminder of the splits among socialists nazis 
and austrian fascists 50 years ago 
roth who is in his mid40s likens the soulsearching to the 
aftermath of a nuclear disaster 
its as if we had this chernobyl in 1938 he said the 
dust settled and slowly we forgot about whether it was radioactive 
waldheim is like a big geiger counter we brought out to 
measure the strength of the emissions and now we have to think how 
to get rid of the nuclear waste weve discovered

the us geological survey has sharply reduced 
its estimates of how much oil and gas remain to be found in the 
united states 
the new figures were provided to scientists at a meeting in 
denver last week while a detailed analysis is expected to be made 
public sometime next month explained ozzie girard the surveys 
deputy assistant director for engineering geology 
the survey now estimates reserves of undiscovered crude oil at 
334 billion barrels well below the 546 billion estimated in a 
1981 study 
in addition the agency has lowered its estimates of the 
nations reserves of undiscovered natural gas at 254 trillion cubic 
feet down from the previous estimate of 4268 trillion 
girard said today that the figures issued in denver were 
preliminary and the survey is preparing reports that will detail 
its findings by region and will also explain the methods used to 
arrive at the nunber and the assumptions made by the scientists 
involved 
the new figures termed working papers by girard are based on a 
twoyear study looking at drilling results in the last few years 
there are two main reasons for the lower estimates one of 
course is that some previously undiscovered oil and gas fields 
have now been found 
in addition however unsuccessful drilling efforts in some 
areas that had been thought to be promising have caused scientists 
to lower their expectations for new finds officials said

a federal appeals judge has temporarily 
halted attempts by the internal revenue service to revoke the 
taxexempt status of ptl the evangelical empire founded by jim 
bakker 
in an order filed late wednesday in richmond va 4th us 
circuit court of appeals judge william wilkins stayed a lower court 
ruling revoking ptls tax exemption wilkins set a march 31 hearing 
in greenville sc where lawyers for ptl are expected to argue 
that loss of its taxexempt status would be a death blow to the 
organization 
wilkins stay gives ptl breathing room as it tries to meet a may 
1 deadline to reorganize itself with a new tax exemption under the 
protection of the federal bankruptcy court 
we see this as being pivotal to the preservation of ptl as we 
know it said one ptl attorney who spoke on condition he was not 
identified 
ptl has debts of more than 60 million and is trying to raise 
about 4 million by may 2 revocation of its taxexempt status 
which it has enjoyed since 1973 could frighten away thousands of 
people who might contribute to ptl the lawyer said 
the matter reached wilkins on appeal from a monday order by us 
district judge karen henderson ms henderson ruled that the irs 
could revoke ptls taxexempt status overturning a december order 
by a us bankruptcy court judge 
if it is subsequently determined that the district court 
incorrectly reversed the bankruptcy court there is a great 
likelihood that ptl and those having a financial interest in it 
will suffer irreparable injury wilkins wrote 
the irs wants to revoke ptls status retroactively to 1981 and 
has said it would seek at least 557 million in back taxes 
in effect the irs has suggested that former ptl leader bakker 
wasnt running a ministry but a profitable business for himself 
relatives and friends

scientists reported encouraging results today in 
the first human tests of an experimental vaccine that fights a 
malariacausing parasite at the stage when it infects red blood 
cells 
studies in young men found that the experimental inoculation 
delayed or suppressed the development of the disease colombian 
scientists reported in todays issue of the british journal nature 
last year other scientists reported partial success for a 
malaria vaccine that attacks the parasite at an earlier stage when 
it is injected by mosquito bites 
while malaria is not a major disease in the united states it 
strikes an estimated 300 million people each year worldwide 
the colombian scientists said their human work followed 
experimental success in monkeys that were injected with the malaria 
parasite called plasmodium falciparum 
they experimented in humans with two proteins to spur the immune 
system to raise defenses against the parasite in its bloodcell 
stage nine volunteers were injected two or three times with one or 
the other while four more were given no inoculation 
the volunteers were also injected with red blood cells infected 
with the malaria parasite 
three of the five volunteers who got one protein had mild 
infections but with a steady decrease in parasite counts and total 
recovery by three weeks another showed no protection and the 
fifth left the study early 
two of the four volunteers vaccinated with the other protein 
showed partial control of the infection for about two weeks but 
then the infection progressed and they were cured with drugs the 
other two who got that protein showed no protection

president kurt waldheim commemorating 
austrias annexation by germany 50 years ago today apologized for 
the crimes committed by austrian nazis but ignored his own 
controversial wartime past 
we must not forget that many of the worst nazi hangmen were 
austrians waldheim said in a televised speech there were 
austrians who were victims and others who were perpetrators 
obviously there is no collective guilt for the war crimes 
committed by austrians the president declared nevertheless as 
head of state of the republic of austria i wish to apologize for 
nazi crimes committed by austrians 
it was the first time that waldheim has used such language in 
public to acknowledge austrias share in world war ii and the 
holocaust 
waldheim did not acknowledge until two years ago that he served 
in world war ii in a german army unit implicated in wartime 
atrocities and he has resisted pressure to resign since it became 
known 
in his speech the president insisted that as a state austria 
was hitlers first victim that is indisputable 
austria was wiped off the map when nazi troops invaded on march 
11 1938 adolf hitler then returned in triumph to austria his 
native land cheered by hundreds of thousands of countrymen 
in april 1938 the nazis said 99 percent of austrians approved 
the anschluss in a nationwide vote more than half a million 
austrians joined the nazi party and many of the brutal guards in 
the concentration camps were austrians 
austrias nazi past largely suppressed here over the past four 
decades has dogged this neutral country since the disclosure in 
march 1986 of waldheims wartime service 
viennas socialist mayor helmut zilk opening an exhibition 
looking back at the nazi era in austria sharply criticized the 
government for reneging on a promise to help fund the display 
zilk charged the coalition government of socialists and 
conservatives had behaved like a dog that shakes off fleas by 
shrugging off the exhibit 
he speculated aid was withheld because the conservatives 
objected to descriptions of the prewar rightist regime called 
austrofascism by liberals and socialists 
in his speech waldheim left unmentioned his wartime years in 
yugoslavia and greece and the furor triggered last month by a 
historians report questioning waldheims integrity during the war 
the report did not furnish evidence to clearly back allegations 
waldheim participated in war crimes but it said he was in close 
proximity to war crimes and did nothing to prevent them 
public pressure after the reports release forced waldheim to 
drop plans to speak at a solemn remembrance of the nazi annexation 
on friday 
waldheim recalled the anschluss as the nazi annexation of 
austria is known as an event that triggered an avalanche of 
suffering 
it was an avalanche of suffering that buried those who thought 
differently and in a terrible racial mania buried our jewish 
fellow citizens waldheim declared millions of jewish people 
were annihilated in the concentration camps 
nothing can explain or excuse those crimes said the 
president i bow in deep respect to those victims who must always 
serve as a reminder and a duty for austria 
the controversy over waldheim has divided austria and tarnished 
the countrys image the us justice department last year barred 
waldheim from the country as an undesirable alien 
waldheim asked foreign critics to see austria not only in the 
light of the horrors of the past but in the light of standing the 
test of the present 
turning to his domestic critics waldheim said i ask you to 
refrain from blanket charges and from unqualified accusations and 
instead to see austria as a country looking into the future open 
to the world ready to assist and selfassured 
he appealed to austrians to wrestle with the shadows of the 
past and repeating earlier statements called for 
reconciliation 
waldheim also outlined what he called a program of discussion 
with politicians of all parties to reform public life and do away 
with a wave of corruption and other scandals that have hit 
headlines in recent months 
the moral standards of all who work in public life should 
improve he said

the massachusetts supreme court today upheld the 
convictions of four men found guilty in the 1983 gang rape of a 
woman on a barroom pool table 
in a pair of unanimous rulings the states highest court 
rejected defense arguments about the fairness of the lengthy 1984 
trial in bristol superior court that attracted national attention 
the case which originally involved six young men of portuguese 
descent drew angry protests by womens groups in support of the 
victim and brought agony to the portugueseamerican community in 
the fishing city of new bedford 60 miles south of boston 
in ruling against the defendants the court upheld the 
punishments handed out to daniel silvia who was sentenced to nine 
to 12 years in the state prison at walpole joseph vieira who drew 
six to eight years and john cordeiro and victor raposo who were 
sentenced to nine to 12 years each two other defendants were 
acquitted 
defense attorneys raised a series of arguments attacking the 
handling of the trial by judge william g young but the high court 
rejected each one saying young did not abuse his discretion 
bristol county district attorney ronald pina said through a 
spokeswoman that he was very pleased with todays rulings 
his faith in the judicial system has been substantiated in 
spite of all the public turmoil in this case hes pleased that the 
community can finally put this issue behind them said 
spokeswoman charlotte enoksen 
none of the four defense attorneys involved in the case were in 
their offices this morning 
the justices noted that the jury could have found credible 
evidence that on the evening of march 6 1983 the victim was 
attacked at big dans tavern in new bedford and was forced to have 
sex as she was held down on the pool table 
on appeal vieira and silvia raised several arguments they 
claimed that the prosecutor failed to make a timely disclosure of 
certain evidence that might have helped the defense depriving them 
of constitutional rights to due process 
they also argued that the bristol county district attorney 
suppressed until after trial a witnesss recorded account of the 
victims condition and statements shortly after the rape 
and they argued that young prejudiced their ability to present a 
defense based on the theory that the victim consented to the sexual 
encounter on that claim vieira and silvia complained about the 
exclusion of an allegedly false prior complaint of rape by the 
woman and other evidence 
each claim was rejected by the unanimous supreme court 
in their separate appeal cordeiro and raposo argued that 
youngs order prohibiting coverage of the victim on camera at the 
televised trial was an abuse that prejudiced their right to a fair 
trial 
they also claimed that young erred in refusing to instruct the 
jury on the defense of consent to rape in addition raposo raised 
claims about youngs decisions on trying the defendants together 
and on allowing evidence of a prior conviction 
again the high court dismissed each claim

most banks said today they didnt 
have the cash to open despite a government goahead to resume 
limited transactions roman catholic bishops urged the military to 
bow to civilian rule 
the national banking association representing 97 of the 
approximately 120 banks doing business in panama said its members 
are not in condition to renew services and will remain closed 
temporarily 
according to the statement banks reiterated to their depositors 
the security of the funds entrusted to them and their inalterable 
decision to find the conditions that might permit the most prompt 
return to normality of the banking system 
it was the eighth straight day of a nationwide bank closure 
which came a few days after the ouster of president eric arturo 
delvalle by supporters of military strongman gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
on wednesday the nations roman catholic bishops appealed to 
the military to subordinate itself to civilian rule 
in a statement distributed by archbishop marcos mcgrath the 
religious leaders also urged fellow panamanians to put personal and 
party interests aside in finding a solution to the crisis 
it said the bishops believe necessary the strict observance of 
constitutional standards the full and effective subordination of 
military forces to civilian authority the search for conditions 
and structure that make possible national elections that deserve 
the credibility of all the voters the restoration of the exercise 
of all human and civil rights and the reopening of the 
communications media 
also wednesday the nephew of the late omar torrijos panamas 
previous strongman disclosed that he had broken with the noriega 
government santiago torrijos said he left his post as chief of 
panamas consulate in los angeles and was joining forces loyal to 
delvalle 
diplomatic sources in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity said torrijos defection was significant because of the 
close identification of his relatives with the defense forces 
the governments national banking commission told local and 
international financial institutions late wednesday they could 
reopen but only to accept deposits and transfer funds among 
themselves and other banks around the world 
none did 
the cash shortage was caused by the freezing of millions of 
dollars in panamanian funds in us banks the united states 
continues to recognize delvalle as the leader of panama and has 
called for the resignation of noriega under indictment in florida 
on drug trafficking charges 
rufina escobar a 55yearold schoolteacher said she had enough 
food on hand at home to make it through the week but if the 
banks dont open next week ill have to ask friends for a few 
dollars just to eat 
arial simons 17 complained that his mother had cut off his 
weekly 10 allowance 
i guess i wont be going to the movies or any parties this 
weekend he said i dont even have the money to buy a beer 
clerks at sarahs one of panama citys most fashionable 
department stores spent their time dusting shelves chatting among 
themselves and waiting on an occasional customer 
people arent buying anything unessential said one young 
clerk whose name tag identified him as esteban theyre being 
very cautious with their money business is way way down 
the young man declined to give his last name because i dont 
want any trouble 
people everywhere were hoarding their cash which was the only 
thing most businesses were accepting because they couldnt process 
checks or credit card transactions 
a lone customer at sarahs cosmetics department was buying 
lipstick occupying the attention of only one of five bored 
saleswomen the customer explained her purchase almost defensively 
as she left the store 
i work in an office and i have to look nice she said then 
she dug into her purse pulled out an empty tube of lipstick and 
declared look this was all i had left i just had to buy more 
but something like new shoes thats out 
the woman whose husband admonished her with a wagging finger 
not to give her name said she hadnt bought anything else except 
household essentials since the banks closed last week 
i bought large bags of beans and rice a lot of milk for the 
kids and things like that she said but were being careful 
too because we dont know how long this thing will last

rep jack kemp quit the race for the 
republican presidential nomination today after a string of poor 
performances in the early primaries and caucuses but vowed to 
carry the flag high for his conservative causes 
we have not failed because our ideas are winning the new 
york congressman said at a capitol hill news conference where he 
clearly signaled his interest in the 1988 vice presidential 
nomination 
flanked by members of his family and house members who supported 
his white house bid kemp said he would not seek reelection to a 
10th term in the house from his district in upstate new york and 
had no plans to run for the senate 
asked about the no 2 spot on this years ticket he said 
obviously you dont make plans to run for vice president asked 
again he called the idea a very flattering and awesome thought 
would i think about it the answer is yes 
kemp departed the race with a pledge to campaign for the 
republican nominee and a blast at the democrats 
we must never compromise with the liberal democratic 
congress he said to applause we must replace the liberal 
democratic congress 
kemp made his exit after failing in his bid to emerge as the 
true heir to the reagan revolution and the conservative alternative 
to gop frontrunner george bush and sen bob dole of kansas 
his efforts were thrwarted by former television evangelist pat 
robertson whose surprise secondplace finish in the leadoff iowa 
caucuses was a blow from which the congressman never recovered 
even so he claimed success for his efforts noting bushs 
statement that he opposes tax increases to cut the deficit and 
doles support for the nicaraguan contra rebels and the star wars 
initiative pushed by president reagan 
kemp bowed out two days after winning just four delegates from 
712 at stake in 17 super tuesday contests his best finish in the 
17 gop contests was a dismal 7 percent showing in the massachusetts 
primary 
kemp had 35 committed delegates but most of those were handed 
to him by bush in a michigan compromise designed to prevent 
robertson from claiming a victory 
campaign spokesman john buckley said kemp spent 15 million on 
his effort and departs with debts of less than 100000 
some aides to kemp had urged him to get out even before the 
super tuesday voting across the south and elsewhere following his 
fourthplace finish in south carolinas primary 
as recently as monday kemp insisted he would press on but he 
acknowledged he had to reassess his candidacy after the tuesday 
voting 
there were rumors we would withdraw after iowa he said 
but im not a quitter im an exquarterback and i dont enter a 
contest lightly 
kemp a former professional football player campaigned as a 
candidate of ideas and claimed to be heir to president reagans 
conservative legacy 
but his emphasis on economic opportunity and talk of returning 
to something like a gold standard didnt excite many conservatives 
who were concerned about more emotional issues despite years of 
work for his white house aspirations kemp was never able to light 
a spark outside his small group of loyalists 
his problem was summed up last year by angela jackson who tried 
to persuade her brother conservative commentator patrick j 
buchanan to enter the presidential race 
jack kemps been out there for two years she said hes 
gone from 7 percent to 7 percent 
kemp 51 formally entered the gop race on april 6 1987 
he was a strong proponent of deploying the strategic defense 
initiative reagans spacebased missile defense system and a 
tough opponent of any tax increase 
he blasted both bush and dole in a debate in dallas in february 
saying they were identical tax raisers whose election would signal 
the end of the reagan revolution his rivals countered that in 
his zeal kemp was ignoring the danger of huge budget deficits

republican presidential hopeful jack kemp quit the race today 
saying we may have suffered a political defeat but our principles 
have not been defeated democrat gary hart was ready to drop out 
a second time as the shrinking field converged on illinois for the 
next big campaign test 
kemp was crushed in the super tuesday landslide of vice 
president george bush who rejoined the campaign trail today after 
taking a day off to rest and celebrate 
the new york congressman congratulated bush and said he would 
be proud to campaign for whoever wins the nomination but he 
endorsed none of the three remaining gop contenders 
i am folding up my tent but i plan to continue to carry the 
flag high said kemp the former pro football quarterback who 
portrayed himself as the natural conservative heir to president 
reagan whose economic programs have included many of kemps ideas 
he said both bush and sen bob dole have embraced conservative 
positions partly because of his presence in the presidential 
campaign 
kemp said he would not seek a new term in congress and was not 
making any plans to run for the senate or to pursue the vice 
presidency however he called the idea of the vice presidential 
nomination a very flattering and awesome thought would i 
think about it the answer is yes 
dole who also was all but buried in the bush victories on 
tuesday campaigned in chicago today trying to sow seeds of doubt 
about bushs chances in november if he should win the gop 
nomination 
i would be a much stronger candidate dole said 
democratic sen albert gore jr of tennessee was also in 
chicago and was making similar comments about his chief rival 
for those who want another election blowout and see the 
democratic party losing 49 of 50 states vote for mike dukakis 
he said 
on wednesday bush suggested to dole his closest competitor 
that the race for the gop nomination was becoming just a bit beside 
the point it might be time he said to turn the attention toward 
the general election in november 
i believe it is now time to look ahead to the issues which 
distinguish us from the democrats the vice president told dole 
in a telegram in which he rebuffed the kansas senators request for 
a series of oneonone debates 
good luck bush added 
dole was having none of that as he searched for a share of 
illinois 82 gop delegates at stake in tuesdays primary 
ive got to win in illinois he said later he told law 
students i feel like ive just taken the finals and i didnt 
flunk but i didnt do too well either 
and he taunted bush for refusing to agree to the nomoderator 
debates saying heres a chance george to finish me off right 
here in illinois 
dole said wednesday that kemp telephoned him to tell him he 
would drop out on thursday and to say he would endorse none of his 
rivals 
it looked like the end of the line for hart as well the 
colorado senator refused to talk to reporters about the super 
tuesday results but he scheduled a denver news conference friday 
morning and sources said he was abandoning his bid 
the super tuesday races left hart disqualified for further 
federal matching funds he technically lost his eligibility last 
month but could have restored it with a 10percent draw in any of 
the days primaries 
hart had already dropped out of the democratic race once in 
may he quit amid reports of his relationship with a miami model 
and he amazed political observers by declaring in december that he 
was back 
let the people decide he said but the people accorded him 
few votes in any of the early contests 
the rest of the democrats were gathering for a forum tonight 
sponsored by illinois democrats 
two of the democrats sen paul simon and jesse jackson were 
campaigning on home turf in illinois with its prize of 173 
democratic delegates simon who bypassed tuesdays contests and 
said he must do well in illinois to continue wasnt planning to 
spend any money on television advertising 
i offer illinois 30 years of service rather than a 30second 
commercial he said 
jackson for his part made a triumphant homecoming to chicago 
on wednesday still thrilled by his showing the day before he 
placed first in the popular vote splitting a big delegate haul 
with massachusetts gov dukakis and gore 
we get stronger every day jackson told plant workers in 
suburban chicago 
at a rally later he promised to eschew attacks on the other 
democrats im moving ahead he said im going to fight 
george bush thats my opposition 
gore however pronounced himself the democrat most likely to 
succeed in november 
im not going to say that any of our candidates are 
unelectable he said in an interview on cable news network but 
i have the best chance 
the theme of electability was also sounded by dukakis i hope 
when the people of illinois cast their votes theyll do so for 
someone who can clearly win the presidency he said 
rep richard gephardt who carried only his home state of 
missouri in tuesdays contests said he was still in the running 
pat robertson his gop campaign flagging said wednesday he 
would take a day off before heading for illinois it isnt over 
yet he said

here is the text of new york rep jack kemps 
statement thursday on his withdrawal from the republican 
presidential race 
last april when i was explaining to my family about our race 
for the presidency we had a moment of family time jeffrey was 
there at the time as well as jimmy and judith and jennifer and 
joanne of course and i quoted the book of ecclesiastes id like 
to share it with you today it tells us that in everything there is 
a season and a time for every purpose under heaven theres a time 
to fight a time to do battle 
well ladies and gentlemen weve fought the good fight weve 
fought long and hard and well i want to thank from the bottom of 
my heart my family my colleagues and comradesinarms the large 
family of kemp supporters across the country i want to tell each 
and every one of you that you can hold your heads high weve waged 
an honorable spirited a principled campaign on issues and ideas 
and frankly in many ways thats the most important victory of all 
but then theres a time to refrain a time to not fight a time 
to accept defeat in one battle so we can move on to fight again i 
want to salute my fellow candidates george bush bob dole pat 
robertson and pete du pont and alexander haig as well and joanne 
and i particularly want to congratulate today george and barbara 
bush for their great victory across the south on super tuesday 
today im withdrawing from the race for president im folding up 
my tent but i want you to know im going to continue to carry the 
flag high now and in the future 
far more important than personal success in an election is the 
cause in which we believe i ran for the presidency to ensure that 
the torch that we lit in 1980 in detroit michigan when we 
nominated ronald reagan and revolutionized the republican party 
would burn even brighter and help light the way into the 1990s 
we may have suffered a political defeat but our principles have 
not been defeated we have not failed because our ideas are 
winning we know our ideas are winning when george bush says we 
must not reduce the deficit by raising taxes that we need to cut 
the capital gains tax that we need to enact free enterprise zones 
to unleash the talent of the inner city and to create more jobs 
and when he says that we need to strengthen free and open trade 
throughout the world 
we know our ideas are winning when bob dole pledges to support 
the freedom fighters and deploy the strategic defense initiative 
we know our ideas are winning when every single republican 
candidate says that he supports the inalienable right to life for 
the born and the unborn and pledges to fight for a profamily and 
a drugfree future for america i want you to know ill be proud 
to campaign for any republican nominee who carries that banner and 
i will fight at his side as long and as far as he carries that 
banner on the field of friendly strife 
to my fellow republicans i would say that in politics as in the 
marketplace winning means staying ahead of your competitors it 
means not only having better ideas but carrying them through to 
completion our party must never drift back to mindless austerity 
we must never close our eyes to economic and moral challege we 
must never break faith with the family or with senior citizens or 
ignore the threat from a dangerous enemy that remains at war with 
freedom and democracy throughout the world 
let the liberal democrats try to raise the burden of taxes on 
the workers and the families of america let liberal democrats turn 
their backs on the freedom fighters around the globe let liberal 
democrats raise tariffs on our allies and friends while they shirk 
the responsibility to preserve peace through strength the american 
people will reject such a party just as roundly and overwhelmingly 
in 1988 as they did in 1980 and 1984 
ladies and gentlemen we must not compromise with the liberal 
democratic congress we must replace the liberal democratic 
congress with a freeenterprise congress ours is a greater cause 
our ideas can move america and the whole world forward but like 
the good shepherd we cant leave anyone behind 
we cant rest until our economy is so strong that theres a job 
for every man and woman in america who wants to work until our 
dollar once again is as good as gold and the budget is in balance 
we cant rest until weve helped freedom fighters to victory and 
until weve researched tested developed deployed and built a 
strategic defense for the united states of america and our allies 
in europe and israel we cant rest until all of us black and 
white christian and jew rich or poor are living in an america 
that is more prosperous but more tolerant more decent and more 
generous an america bound together as the founder of our party 
abraham lincoln envisioned the republican party as a people 
party as a freedom party as an emancipation party to help make 
america one nation under god with liberty and justice and equality 
of opportunity for all 
i want to close if i can my remarks by pulling from my pocket 
something ive carried around with me since super tuesday joanne 
and i went to bed tuesday night and found a little note on our 
pillow from one of our children it was from our daughter jennifer 
and she told us that she loved us and that she was proud of us and 
then as a typical kemp child she ended by quoting winston 
churchill and it wasnt because they all went to winston churchill 
high school its because all the kemps love churchill as 
freedomloving men and women do throughout the world 
jennifer ended her little letter by saying finally dad as 
winston churchill said success is never final failure is never 
fatal its courage that counts and youre the most courageous 
people i know well i want you all to know that no father no 
candidate no human being could ask for more than to have a 
courageous family courageous comradesinarms and courageous men 
and women around this country who believe in the ideas upon which 
america was built in the past and upon which alone we can build 
a great victory for america and the world in the future 
thank you jennifer thank you to my family thank you to each 
and every one of you and may god continue to bless america thank 
you very very very much

in lhasa contacted by telephone from the southwest china city of 
chengdu 
but more than 100 trucks carrying armed police drove through the 
main streets of the city of 150000 in a show of force and several 
dozen police with machine guns stood in front of the citys holiest 
buddhist temple the jokhang said benjamin watson of new york

tibetan said tibetans had told her of a police sweep today on the 
jokhang temple in which monks were arrested she spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
she said armed police were stationed at every corner of the 
barkhor market square around the jokhang and there was no 
recurrence of saturdays daylong battle between police and monkled 
tibetans

chinese rule that resulted in the flight of the dalai lama 
spiritual leader of the tibetans and 100000 followers and a 
bloody crackdown by the chinese army

texas fired a new salvo in its war 
against florida citrus by suing us agriculture secretary richard 
e lyng 
the suit filed wednesday in federal court in brownsville 
accuses lyng of violating federal law when the us department of 
agriculture ended a 3year quarantine on shipments of fresh 
florida citrus to texas and other citrusproducing areas 
texas wants to keep the florida fruit out because of a fear of 
bacterial citrus canker officials said canker prompted the ban on 
florida citrus after an outbreak of the disease in some areas there 
in august 1984 
us district judge filemon vela denied texas request for an 
emergency stay of a usda rule that on feb 11 ended the florida 
citrus ban 
vela scheduled a hearing for monday morning when federal 
attorneys will have an opportunity to comment on the action brought 
wednesday by officials of the texas attorney generals office and 
state agriculture department 
usda officials in washington declined comment on the lawsuit 
this morning said department spokeswoman tammy bragg 
the suit accuses lyng of violating the federal administrative 
procedure act by lifting the quarantine without publishing notice 
and providing a chance for a public hearing 
the bacterial canker disease can cause defoliation of citrus 
trees lesions that render the fruit unmarketable and premature 
dropping of the fruit from the tree the disease exists in several 
forms with some considered less dangerous than others 
a gulf coast area of florida where the aggressive asiatic strain 
of canker was discovered remains under quarantine 
last september the usda published a proposal to lift the 
quarantine against florida fruit but on jan 5 withdrew the 
proposal after new canker outbreaks were discovered in florida 
on feb 15 four days after lyng lifted the ban texas imposed 
an emergency 30day quarantine on fresh florida citrus 
florida producers maintain that canker presents a minimal threat 
to the texas citrus industry and some florida growers filed suit 
last month to stop the texas quarantine the quarantine would have 
expired next saturday 
a federal court in austin on march 1 overturned the texas 
quarantine and ruled that the federal rule took precedence over 
the states action 
the suit filed on wednesday accuses lyng of violating federal 
law by not giving the public or the state opportunity to comment 
the texas suit seeks reinstatement of the quarantine and a 
formal hearing process if usda makes a new proposal to end the 
quarantine on florida citrus 
the lawsuit says texas at least would like to keep florida fruit 
out of the lower rio grande valley where the states 65 million 
citrus industry is concentrated on about 30000 acres in hidalgo 
cameron and willacy counties

the soviet union said today that an agreement on 
the withdrawal of its troops from afghanistan is not a commitment 
to end military aid to the kabul government 
soviet ambassador nikolay kozyrev said the question of a halt to 
soviet assistance has not arisen in the almost 6yearold 
unsponsored afghanistan peace talks 
he said the draft agreement would not bar any kind of soviet 
aid except the sending of new troops into afghanistan where the 
soviets intervened in 1979 an estimated 115000 soviet troops are 
helping the marxist government fight usbacked moslem insurgents 
kozyrev rejected the us demand for a symmetrical cessation 
of military aid to both sides in the war kozyrev said it was an 
attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of afghanistan and in 
the bilateral relationship between kabul and moscow 
he said the demand would be tantamount to moscow calling for an 
end to us military aid for pakistan 
kozyrev also warned that if a geneva settlement were not signed 
a new flareup of bloodshed and fratricidal war cannot be 
excluded 
kozyrev a specialist on asian affairs came to geneva as head 
of a soviet team of experts to follow the peace talks his remarks 
followed a statement by afghan foreign minister abdul wakil who 
said wednesday that moscow had helped afghanistan for years and 
would continue to do so after the troop withdrawal 
wakil has said earlier that the draft agreements provided only 
for a halt to arms shipments to the guerrillas fighting the kabul 
government the united states is considered the insurgents main 
supplier with deliveries totaling a reported 700 million last 
year 
kozyrev said the peace talks have bogged down because of 
pakistans insistence on having a settlement linked to the 
formation of a transitional government in kabul to oversee the 
withdrawal of the red army troops 
pakistan which represents afghan rebels in the peace talks 
says that a government to replace the present sovietbacked one 
would ensure stability and the safe return of more than 5 million 
afghan refugees 
kozyrev sidestepped a question on whether negotiations could 
continue after next tuesday a target date set by moscow soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev said last month that the troops would 
leave afghanistan starting may 15 if an agreement were reached 
march 15 
i can only hope that the other side pakistan will show 
enough common sense and responsibility he said adding later 
it is too early to say what will happen after that date 
wakil and the pakistani delegations have both made plain that 
they do not consider march 15 a deadline and that a settlement at a 
later date would just put off the start of the withdrawal

republican presidential candidate bob dole sought 
today to sow doubts about the partys frontrunner saying vice 
president george bush will face a tough tough race in november 
if he is the gop nominee 
i would be a much stronger candidate dole said as he 
campaigned in the chicago area thats the message were going to 
try to make in the next couple of days 
dole planned to concentrate today on suburban chicago before 
heading downstate for a swing friday through farm country where the 
kansas senator considers his support the strongest 
he started the day with a tour of the rehabilitation hospital of 
chicago which is near another hospital where dole underwent 
surgery 40 years ago for injuries he received in world war ii 
this is going to be the political recovery state just as it 
was the personal recovery state 40 years ago dole said on 
wednesday that may be more symbolism than anything but to me it 
is an indication that it can be done 
on wednesday one day after doles super tuesday drubbing a 
senior campaign adviser was quizzed whether the results had 
triggered a meltdown in the kansas republicans presidential 
candidacy 
well we might have started evacuating around the reactor 
quipped the aide thomas rath 
his reply reflected the perilous situation as doles campaign 
works toward the march 15 illinois primary which even the 
candidate openly acknowledges is a doordie contest if he is to 
have any chance of beating vice president george bush for the gop 
presidential nomination 
dole campaigning in the chicago area on wednesday said he must 
win at least 65 percent of all remaining delegates nationwide as 
well as those who are uncommitted if he is to emerge victorious 
his first objective is illinois a state where bush has the backing 
of gov james thompson and 93 of the states 102 gop county 
chairmen 
ive got to win illinois dole said bluntly at one campaign 
stop later speaking to northwestern university law school 
students dole made it even more clear that his political survival 
was at stake he renewed a challenge to bush to participate in a 
series of freewheeling oneoneone debates 
i just appeal to george bush heres a chance george to 
finish me off right here in illinois dole said the debate 
challenge is mentioned at every campaign stop and is a key part of 
doles strategy to try to draw bush into a discussion of issues and 
break his link to president reagan dole attributes bushs sweep of 
the 17 super tuesday primaries and caucuses to reagans popularity 
george bush is running like ronald reagan said dole its 
tough to beat ronald reagan i cant beat him i can beat bush but 
beating ronald reagan is impossible bush has wrapped himself 
around reagan and its been very effective 
dole never misses an opportunity to chip away at bushs record 
and to raise questions about the vice presidents ability to defeat 
a democrat in the november general election 
i dont have any real quarrel with george bush except i think 
im a stronger person i think i know more about the issues i 
think im a better leader bush told a group of lawyers at a 
downtown chicago reception 
already the dole campaign is airing television advertising in 
illinois that touts doles leadership in the senate and focuses on 
what the kansan says are nine different answers by bush to his role 
in the irancontra armsforhostages affair similar ads were used 
to no avail against bush in the south 
but increasingly dole is highlighting the electability 
question in his attempts to revive his campaign even though he 
concedes its hard to make that an issue 
i think there is one person between me and the white house and 
that is george bush dole quipped at the lawyers reception i 
think there are a couple of people between him and the white 
house 
dole told supporters if i can turn it around in illinois 
then the momentum changes 
the republicans i think will take a deep breath and 
reconsider the choice before them he said and thats why i 
take heart that im sort of back in the heartland

here are excerpts of a televised speech 
thursday by president kurt waldheim as austria remembers the nazi 
annexation of march 1938 the text was translated from german by 
the associated press 
 
in these days we are remembering the events which 50 years ago 
led us into the darkest epoch of our recent history 
there were also hundreds of thousands of austrians who 
welcomed the anschluss who feted hitler and the invasion and 
pinned many false hopes on it 
it was a mass psychosis of a kind that only totalitarian regimes 
can create today we know that one should resist the very 
beginnings of intolerance and instigation today we know where the 
fanning of fanaticism hate and violence lead 
today we know that with march 11 1938 an avalanche of 
suffering was triggered 
it was an avalanche of suffering that buried those who thought 
differently and in a terrible racial mania buried our jewish 
fellow citizens the holocaust is one of the greatest tragedies of 
world history millions of jewish people were annihilated in the 
concentration camps nothing can explain or excuse those crimes i 
bow in deep respect before these victims who must always be a 
reminder and a duty for us 
the avalanche of suffering also caught up countless men and 
women of the resistance who had to give their life for the freedom 
of austria 
we must not forget that many of the worst nazi hangmen were 
austrians there were austrians who were victims and others who 
were perpetrators let us not give rise to the impression that we 
had nothing to do with this obviously there is no collective 
guilt nevertheless as head of state of the republic of austria i 
wish to apologize for nazi crimes committed by austrians 
but as a state austria was hitlers first victim that is 
indisputable though it resisted hitlers political and economic 
pressure for years it went under the international community of 
states gave us no help against the aggression 
our country is open to criticism as the head of state of our 
republic however i would ask the critics to be fair and 
objective i would ask them not only to see austria in the light of 
the horrors of the past but in the light of how it has stood the 
test in the present 
i ask you to refrain from blanket charges and from unqualified 
accusations and to look at austria as it stands in the late 1980s 
secure and open to dialogue open to the world ready to assist 
selfassured and pointed toward the future 
but as your elected president i also appeal to you my dear 
countrywomen and countrymen to wrestle with the shadows of the 
past the meaning of these days lies in reflection not in dispute 
the meaning of these days can be only one thing reconciliation 
the ugly storm of scandals which has confronted us in the last 
years underlies the necessity of a basic reform of public life 
of an improvement of moral standards for all who have to act and 
work in the public interest in the coming months i will use the 
authority of this office to discuss the perspectives and contours 
of such a reform with representatives of all political institutions 
in austria 
the moral renewal of our republic is an undertaking which can 
only have the desired success if it is supported and carried by all 
those responsible 
let us assume resonsibility for our mistakes in a way that would 
encourage avoiding mistakes in the future let us love our country 
without false shame and arrogant pride so that austria also finds a 
place in the hearts of youth 
as a country that has come to terms with itself 
as a country which has learned from history 
as a country that despite some mistakes deserves affection 
as our common much tested much loved austria

fans of robin hood are up in arms and the city of 
nottingham has been accused of shooting itself in the wallet by 
putting out a tourism brochure debunking the legend of the medieval 
outlaw 
the glossy color brochure takes a skeptical academic line on 
robin hood his love affair with maid marian the existence of his 
faithful lieutenant friar tuck and that he robbed the rich to give 
to the poor 
we are not debunking anything we are putting robin hood in 
historical context insisted city council spokesman tim jones 
the city fathers have done a disservice to their own city 
countered malcolm barker of the robin hood society who took up the 
cudgels on the outlaws behalf 
barker doesnt claim that the story as handed down by 
hollywood is true he simply objects to tinkering with a beautiful 
legend that also is a major tourist attraction 
if mickey mouse can bring a fortune into florida why 
shouldnt robin hood bring a fortune in to the people of 
nottingham he said in a british radio interview 
the affair came to light thursday in londons daily telegraph in 
a report headlined robin hood is robbed of myth and romance 
the brochure undermines many of the popular notions about robin 
hood and his band of merry men not to mention his favorite woman 
maid marian it says comes from a 13th century french poem 
while chubby friar tuck is probably an amalgam of two characters 
from different parts of england 
as for robin himself the brochure notes that in the earliest 
tales he was a highwayman who robbed travelers in neighboring 
yorkshire and was in business strictly for himself 
graham black curator of nottingham castle museum and a 
historian whose work contributed to the brochure was quoted by the 
telegraph as saying one of the problems about robin hood is that 
the legend is 700 years old a story handed on by word of mouth 
and it was 200 years before people became literate 
his philanthropy was the fashionable academic interpretation 
of the 1950s black said but there is no evidence for this 
jones said in an interview that the legend took its present form 
under the 19th century victorians 
it remains a potent one when raisa gorbachev wife of the 
soviet leader visited nottingham in 1984 city officials said she 
asked about robin hood apparently regarding him as a socialist who 
believed in the redistribution of wealth 
barker the outlaws defender said does it really matter 
its an admans dream weve got something here that is 
wonderful visitors come from all over the world that know about 
robin hood and maid marian and i think that the city fathers have 
done a disservice to their own city 
nottingham a city of 290000 people in central england can 
hardly be accused of neglecting the legend its main beltway is 
called maid marian way and two rival consortiums are planning 
robin hood exhibition centers for the city 
hordes of tourists visit the sherwood forest center where they 
can see displays of medieval lifestyles and gaze at the oak tree 
where the merry men may or may not have relaxed after a hard days 
archery 
brian marshal chairman of the city tourism council that 
produced the brochure says the debate about maid marian is largely 
irrelevant people are more interested in robin hood versus the 
sheriff of nottingham he said because its always the good guy 
against the bad guy isnt it 
i think people will feel what they feel if they want to 
believe in maid marian then theyll do that he said

the pentagon doesnt know whether the sale of 
japanese machine milling equipment helped the soviet union build 
quieter submarines according to a top defense department official 
the soviet union was building quiet propellers for its subs 
three years before the toshiba equipment was exported between 1983 
and 1985 said richard armitage assistant secretary of defense for 
international security affairs 
armitages assessment was contained in a letter outlining the 
pentagons opposition to congressional proposals which would limit 
or ban the sale of toshiba products in the united states 
toshiba officials admitted last year that a subsidiary company 
had sold the soviet union machine tools for making quiet submarine 
propellers 
navy officials have said in the past that soviet subs were 
noisier than their american counterparts making it easier for the 
united states to keep track of the soviet subs both sides are 
continually seeking to develop quieter submarines 
armitages views were outlined in a letter to rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee the letter 
was released thursday 
the indignation felt in the united states is understandable 
armitage said he added that perhaps some americans dont fully 
realize that many japanese feel a similar indignation complemented 
by acute embarrassment 
the actual damage done from the toshiba machinery diversions 
is difficult to assess armitage said 
despite allegations of tens of even 100 billion in damages 
our navy cannot determine the direct costs of this diversion to 
us national security because the soviets had quiet propellers 
three years before the first diversion and we had already planned 
programs to deal with this development he said 
a conference committee of 20 house members and seven senators is 
trying to work out housesenate differences on an omnibus trade 
bill and one of the unresolved issues involves toshiba 
the house bill contains no sanctions against the company while 
the senate version would ban the sale of any toshiba products in 
the united states for two years to five years toshiba has annual 
us sales of 3 billion to 4 billion 
actions by the us government against toshiba would be 
interpreted in japan as motivated by trade imbalances rather than 
by national security concerns armitage said 
he predicted that japanese efforts to protect sensitive 
technology will greatly improve as a result of what has happened 
but only if we dont undercut the posttoshiba actions by the 
japanese government which he described as unprecedented 
the pentagon is considering whether to sell the japanese navy 
four aegis ship defense systems costing 1 billion each the 
system contains the navys most sophisticated antiaircraft 
electronic gear and some critics in congress have questioned 
whether the aegis sale is a good idea in the wake of the toshiba 
case

the house today overwhelmingly demanded the 
ouster of panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega and urged 
president reagan to impose strong sanctions to encourage 
restoration of civilian rule in panama 
before the 3672 roll call vote on an antinoriega resolution 
the panamanian military ruler was denounced during floor debate as 
a gunrunning thug and one of the most ruthless tyrants of our 
time 
voting against the resolution were representatives george w 
crockett jr dmich and henry b gonzalez dtexas 
now is the time for gen noriega to step down and open the 
door for true democracy in panama said rep benjamin gilman 
rny 
said rep dan mica dfla noriega must leave and he must 
leave quickly 
the resolution sponsored chiefly by mica said the house is 
deeply concerned about the deterioration of united 
statespanamanian relations and calls on noriega to comply with 
president eric arturo delvalles order dismissing him as commander 
of the panamanian defense forces 
the resolution also calls on the president to consider 
seriously the range of additional economic and political sanctions 
available to the united states that could be used to encourage the 
reestablishment of civilian authority in panama 
the house action came as the reagan administration studied tough 
new sanctions against panama and two prominent panamanian 
diplomats deserted the noriega government 
santiago torrijos nephew of former panamanian leader omar 
torrijos abandoned his post as consul general in los angeles and 
flew to washington to join forces with allies of the ousted 
delvalle 
torrijos late uncle was widely esteemed in panama for 
negotiating with president carter for the treaty under which the 
panama canal will revert to panama by the year 2000 the former 
consul general accused the noriega regime of plunging panama into a 
political crisis 
panamanian ambassador juan b sosa who supports delvalle said 
wednesday that santiago torrijos decision to break with noriega 
will have a major impact on panama because of the close 
identification of the torrijos family with panamas defense forces 
torrijos is believed to be the first member of the torrijos family 
to break ranks with noriega 
omar torrijos dominated panamas political life from 1968 until 
his death in a plane crash in 1981 in a typewritten statement made 
public wednesday night his nephew said a political financial 
moral and social crisis exists in panama and must be resolved 
he said that a small politicalmilitary circle has betrayed 
the pledge of omar torrijos to return panama to constitutional rule 
meanwhile the panamanian embassy made public a copy of a letter 
by panamas ambassador to mexico emilia arosemena vallarino in 
which she announced her resignation because she was in 
disagreement with political events in her country she had served 
in mexico for 18 years and was dean of the diplomatic corps there 
at issue are the circumstances under which panamas new 
government took power two weeks ago delvalle attempted to fire 
noriega but was fired himself hours later 
the reagan administration along with a number of panamanian 
diplomats and consular officers have refused to recognize the 
successor government regarding delvalle as the constitutional 
authority he has remained in hiding for almost two weeks 
today highlevel meetings were scheduled at which 
administration officials were considering a series of economic 
sanctions against panama 
us officials who asked not to be identified said that it is 
almost certain that the united states will withhold a 65 million 
payment due to panama on march 15 for canalrelated operations 
also being considered are measures that would have the effect of 
making some panamanian products less competitive in us markets 
state department figures show that panamas us exports totaled 
342 million last year but commerce department statistics list 
that category at 388 million 
the officials said panama may lose its right to participate in 
the caribbean basin initiative under which some products are 
allowed dutyfree access to the united states 
to be eligible to take part nations of central america and the 
caribbean must cooperate in combatting drug smuggling to the united 
states 
the reagan administration has concluded that panama has not been 
cooperating and two federal grand juries have handed down 
indictments accusing noriega of being a key figure in an 
international drug trafficking operation 
but white house chief of staff howard baker denied wednesday 
that the united states is planning an invasion of panama saying 
american troops there are merely holding regularly scheduled 
training exercises 
jorge abadia panamas foreign minister this week accused the 
united states of conducting the prelude of an armed invasion by 
staging military exercises along the panama canal

gov evan mechams former chief of staff 
testified today at the governors impeachment trial that he would 
not have directed the states public safety director to stonewall 
an investigation as the governor is accused of doing 
mecham who faces removal from office by the state senate is 
accused of trying to thwart an investigation into an alleged death 
threat by thenstate prison construction chief lee watkins against 
a former mecham aide donna carlson the threat allegedly was made 
as ms carlson was about to appear before a grand jury 
investigating mechams campaign finances watkins has denied 
threatening ms carlson 
mecham also is accused of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
and misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund by loaning 
it to his auto dealership 
richard burke the governors first defense witness was 
crossexamined by prosecutor william french in his second day on 
the stand 
he acknowledged that he would not have made the statements that 
mecham is accused of making nov 15 to department of public safety 
director ralph milstead 
french quoted from statements milstead has testified mecham made 
regarding plans for officer frank martinez and lt beau johnson to 
give statements to the attorney generals office about the alleged 
threat 
would you under any circumstances mr burke tell mr 
milstead i dont want frank or beau giving any statements to the 
attorney general would you say that french asked 
no burke replied 
would you say this dont tell the attorney general 
anything french said 
no burke answered 
burke a former law school dean and federal prosecutor who came 
out of retirement last november to serve as mechams chief of 
staff said he believed mecham understood that a serious threat may 
have been made against carlson although burke was not certain 
whether it was specified that it was an alleged death threat 
i think all of us assumed that it was a crime or a potential 
crime or it wouldnt have been reported to us burke said 
french asked whether it was milsteads job to report the alleged 
crime and the governor would not have the authority to stop it 
my impression of law enforcement certainly that would be 
true burke said 
burke said however that he agreed with mechams contention in 
a television interview several days after he was told about the 
alleged threat that he knew little about it 
during house impeachment hearings in january mecham insisted 
that the report to the department of public safety violated an 
unwritten rule against disclosing things that happen in the 
governors office 
the prosecution rested its case wednesday on the death threat 
allegation the first of the three major charges against mecham 
no man is above the law prosecutor paul eckstein said in 
his closing argument the evidence that has been put before you 
cries out for a conviction 
defense lawyer fred craft argued that prosecutors had not proven 
mecham tried to obstruct an investigation because nobody told the 
governor that there was indeed an attorney generals investigation 
that he could possibly obstruct 
mecham 63 who ran an auto dealership before he was elected 
governor in a threeway race has contended he handled the matter 
properly by having watkins boss thendepartment of administration 
director max hawkins investigate 
a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is required to convict 
mecham and remove the firstterm republican from office 
the governor also faces an april 21 criminal trial on charges of 
hiding the 350000 loan and a may 17 recall election 
maricopa county superior court judge michael ryan said wednesday 
he was reluctantly granting a prosecution motion to delay the 
criminal trial which had been scheduled to start march 22 the 
judge said more time was needed to decide pretrial motions and 
gather a large pool of potential jurors 
mecham the first us governor to be impeached in six decades 
has not attended the impeachment trial but senators wednesday were 
shown a nov 16 tv interview in which he denied knowledge of the 
alleged death threat

the probe of the collision of two army 
blackhawk helicopters that killed 17 soldiers has found no link to 
mechanical problems that have grounded the militarys uh60s in 
recent years an investigator says 
i would say now there is no indication of any mechanical 
factor in tuesday nights crash said chief warrant officer joe 
s adams one of three investigators from the army safety center at 
fort rucker ala 
we are looking at human and environmental factors the human 
factors might include some restriction of vision he said 
wednesday 
both pilots were using nightvision goggles which amplify light 
from the stars and the moon allowing pilots to fly undetected at 
night officials said they were trying to determine whether the 
choppers were flying without lights 
the crash was the worst army aviation disaster since 248 
soldiers also based at fort campbell died in a chartered plane 
crash in canada while returning from a mideast peacekeeping mission 
in december 1985 
the 17 died instantly in the collision the worst ever at the 
fort in southwestern kentucky but eight bodies remained buried 
under the wreckage for hours spokesmen said 
the armys fleet of 820 uh60s was grounded twice last may once 
for inspection and once because of a design flaw the fleet also 
was grounded in april 1985 and march 1986 after fatal crashes in 
1985 the army identified a defect in the main rotor assembly and 
ordered it corrected 
last summer officials said about 40 people had been killed in 
crashes of the helicopter since 1978 
the collision occurred when a copter on a night training mission 
struck a formation of three other blackhawks on a separate mission 
adams said 
the formation was flying east at about 250 feet above the ground 
when the lead blackhawk was hit broadside by the lone aircraft 
which was traveling north army spokesmen said 
a flight data recorder installed in 100 of the armys 
helicopters was recovered from the northbound craft and will be 
checked for signs of mechanical failure in the copter adams said 
the other craft had no recorder 
the manufacturer sikorsky aircraft of stratford conn sent a 
safety expert to assist investigators adams said a report was 
expected in two to three months 
investigators hoped that air traffic control tapes would reveal 
whether the pilots knew their copters were converging 
the helicopters are not equipped with radar and the pilots 
wearing the night vision goggles were operating under visual 
flight rules with visibility of at least one mile and a ceiling of 
500 feet adams said 
the accident occurred on the kentuckytennessee state line 6 
miles from the copters airstrip about 60 miles north of nashville 
the army identified the dead as staff sgt charles l shirley 
32 of madison ill billie d bolin 29 of greensburg ky 
james m guill 33 of georgetown ky richard l alter 29 of 
williamsport pa and clifford w bath iii 19 of charleston sc

ky spec 4 samuel a hintz 24 of sherrodsville ohio and 
timothy s sayer 20 of worthington ohio 
shirley sabot and hintz were from the 2nd battalion 502nd 
infantry identifications of the other two victims were withheld 
pending notification of relatives 
he believed he was doing what was right doing it for his 
country jerry shirley of clarksville tenn said of his 
brother an 11year army man its something he wanted to do he 
was a career man he started when he was 17 and had a break and 
went back in we accepted the risk 
lt col charles adams the post chaplain said 35 chaplains on 
post social service agencies and a support group of military wives 
have offered help to survivors a memorial service was scheduled 
for next wednesday 
theres a tremendous amount of shock and grief but there has 
been no recrimination from any of the people we have talked to 
said adams 
thirteen of the dead most of them infantrymen were in the 
blackhawk that had been flying in formation the other victims were 
crew members in the second copter 
the blackhawk one of the armys newer helicopters normally is 
operated with a crew of three and can carry 11 combatequipped 
soldiers 
it is a utility and assault aircraft designed for air cavalry 
and medical evacuations said maj phil soucy an army spokesman in 
washington dc 
soucy said there had been no move by safety investigators to 
ground the blackhawk fleet as a result of the accident

a 70yearold man known as the father 
of the iditarod pocketed 2500 in silver ingots today for being 
the first to reach the halfway point of the 1100mile iditarod 
trail sled dog race 
joe redington of knik reached the cripple checkpoint at 540 
am his nearest competitor herbie nayokpuk of shishmaref checked 
into ophir 55 miles behind redington at 1110 pm wednesday

ahead swenson said 
a blizzard pounding alaskas southwestern coast threatened to

us surgeon general c everett koop said today he 
supports trying out a needleexchange program for drug addicts in 
the united states to slow the spread of aids 
while stressing that he was not proposing such a plan but rather 
supporting others who call for it koop said drug abuse was the 
likeliest way aids or aquired immune deficiency syndrome could 
spread through the heterosexual population 
i think we should have a pilot program in the united states 
he said in an interview during the first international conference 
on the global impact of aids about 1000 health specialists from 
63 countries are attending the threeday meeting which opened 
monday at londons barbican center 
under needleexchange programs in europe drug addicts can turn 
in used needles for new ones reducing the risk of contracting aids 
from contaminated drug equipment 
koop acknowledged that many people object to such schemes as 
abetting illegal drug abuse we have to decide whether or not the 
risk of aids from needlesharing is great enough to satisfy that 
objection he said 
if needle exchange could contain the epidemic nobody should 
be against it koop said 
he said pilot projects should be conducted in more than one city 
and mentioned as possibilities new york and los angeles he said a 
nationwide program shouldnt be considered until results of pilot 
programs in the united states and other countries are studied 
a pilot project is proposed for new york but koop criticized it 
for using volunteer methadone users methadone is a substitute used 
to wean addicts off heroin and the volunteers having made the 
commitment to quit drugs should not be exposed again to using 
needles he said 
also wednesday dr manuel carballo chief of social and 
behavioral researcher for the world health organizations global 
program on aids outlined the organizations strategy for slowing 
the spread of the disease dr jonathan mann director of the who 
program was to have given the speech but was unable to attend the 
final days session 
discussion focused on how to reconcile control of the disease 
with individual freedom and on international and national policy on 
aids and its prevention 
a 33nation gallup international survey on attitudes toward aids 
presented to the conference wednesday said that 47 percent of 
respondents in the united states favor testing the entire 
population for aids 
koop said he was totally opposed to mandatory screening 
arguing that only a tiny fraction of the population behaved in a 
way that courted risk 
apart from north america some parts of south america and some 
asian countries concern among individuals about contracting aids 
is relatively low the survey found 
as far as becoming an epidemic was concerned throughout the 
world there was a clear realization that this was likely to occur 
in the case of homosexuals hemophiliacs intravenous drug users 
and promiscuous people the survey says 
in terms of the risk of catching the disease most of the 
peoples of the world were aware of the clear situations in which it 
could be caught it added 
but the survey says substantial minorities in many parts of the 
world do not understand how the disease is transmitted and said 
they would refuse to work with a person carrying the aids virus 
there is a fear that one can get aids by means which are not 
supported by scientific practice for instance sharing a drinking 
glass or via insect bites other perceived risks such as 
coughs and sneezes friendly kissing appear to be 
identified 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread through sexual contact needles 
or syringes shared by drug users infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

the soviet union is continuing to ship arms to 
nicaragua at a fast pace despite efforts by the usbacked contra 
guerrillas and sandinista government to negotiate a peace accord 
the pentagon said thursday 
during the first two months of 1988 the nicaraguans received 
3100 metric tons or 3400 regular tons of weaponry and war 
materiel worth an estimated 100 million the pentagon said 
the equipment was delivered in 10 arms shipments in january and 
february the defense department said 
if that pace is sustained the nicaraguans will receive at least 
18600 metric tons of weaponry this calendar year compared with an 
estimated 21700 metric tons delivered in 1987 
last years arms deliveries to nicaragua were valued by the 
pentagon at 505 million and arrived in 62 shipments 
the januaryfebruary estimates are contained in an unclassified 
assessment of the nicaraguan military buildup that is updated 
periodically by the defense department for administration leaders 
it was released on request by the pentagons public affairs office 
including the latest estimates the pentagon maintains the 
nicaraguan government has received arms valued at more than 24 
billion since calendar year 1980 
the new update was prepared at a time when president reagan is 
working with lawmakers to fashion an aid program for the contra 
guerrillas us aid to the contras was cut off feb 29 after the 
house refused to endorse an administration plan for military and 
humanitarian aid and then rejected a democratic alternative to 
provide just humanitarian aid 
it also comes during a period of rising doubt about the future 
of peace negotiations nicaraguan leader daniel ortega has 
dismissed roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo as a 
mediator in the talks and the contras have said they need more 
time to consider some of the sandinista proposals

secretary of state george p shultz said 
thursday that south korea has accomplished a political miracle 
in its peaceful transition to civilian rule 
i think the korean situation is one weve all watched very 
closely and worked on hard he told members of the house foreign 
operations appropriations subcommittee and in south korea they 
have managed to put a political miracle alongside their economic 
miracle 
however shultz said later that it would be bold to predict when 
us troops could be withdrawn 
he said president chun doohwan engineered this change and 
takes considerable pride in being the first leader of korea to pass 
the leadership to somebody else in a peaceful transition of power 
so its a major and important event 
he promised us support to the new government 
shultz was asked about reports that the 40000 us troops could 
be withdrawn by 1990 he replied that he thought no date could be 
set 
the united states would like to see more stability in the korean 
peninsula he said 
but there is a very militaristic north korea whose 
performance has been terrible he went on 
shultz said there was quite compelling evidence that north 
korean intelligence was responsible for blowing up an airliner 
progress is most likely by taking small steps such as exchanging 
family members he said adding that the holding of the olympic 
games in korea will also be a positive element

in michigan said deputy campaign manager joe trippi we need 
to win it or at least come in second to jesse a reference to 
jesse jackson 
trippi said as many as 70 paid staffers would be sent to 
michigan by next week compared to roughly 20 staffers in illinois 
well take virtually every organizer we have he said 
we had our bad day on super tuesday but now were back and 
were still in the middle of this race gephardt said 
gephardt rejected any comparisons with new york rep jack kemp 
who dropped from the republican presidential race earlier thursday 
he pointed to his strong showings in several early contests 
including victories in iowa and south dakota and said he has the 
backing of 80 members of congress most of whom will be delegates 
to the democratic national convention this summer 
unlike jack kemp i have been in the middle of this race from 
the beginning gephardt said i have a delegate count that is 
within striking distance of being back in the leadership 
throughout the day on thursday gephardt continued to hammer at 
the central theme of his campaign talking tough on trade thats 
designed to appeal in south carolina where the textile industry 
has been damaged by foreign competition as well as in michigan 
with its auto industry 
the united auto workers union a major force in michigan 
democratic politics is remaining neutral but gephardt aides said 
they anticipated getting support from union locals and 
rankandfile members because of his trade and economic positions

three east germans crashed a flatbed truck through 
steel barriers and roared over glienicker bridge into west berlin 
on thursday in the first escape of its kind over the famed bridge 
of spies officials said 
bernd puhlmann who drove the truck in the highspeed escape to 
the west said a soviet soldier on the east german side of the 
bridge took aim at the vehicle but did not fire 
pulhmann said he thought that empty propane tanks that had been 
loaded onto the truck may have accounted for the soldiers 
reluctance 
because the soldier didnt know what was in the tanks he 
probably did not dare to shoot the 37yearold puhlmann told 
reporters 
puhlmann said he and his two friends decided while drinking beer 
about midnight to make the escape 
two hours later the 7ton truck plowed through two east german 
metal gates and a chainlink fence before racing onto the glienicker 
bridge which has been made famous by numerous eastwest spy 
exchanges 
the truck sped across the bridge smashing through another east 
germanbuilt chainlink fence and tearing off a steel control gate 
in west berlin before coming to a halt police said 
with the truck demolished the three escapees got out uninjured 
and called west berlin authorities said a west berlin police 
spokesman who asked not to be further identified 
this is the first time that anyone has broken through those 
barriers said another police officer 
glienicker bridge connects potsdam east germany with west 
berlin potsdam is on berlins southwest outskirts 
the trucks impact tore the 4foothigh steel gate on the west 
berlin side of the bridge off its foundation and twisted the 
barrier into a halfcircle 
wrecked barriers could be seen on the east german side of the 
bridge as well 
metal glass plastic and motor oil from the truck were strewn 
across the area 
the demolished truck sat with its engine compartment smashed and 
bumpers dangling 
puhlmann said he gotthard ihden 37 and werner jaeger 28 all 
of potsdam decided to try the escape because they were 
dissatisfied with political conditions in communist east germany 
west berlin officials said the three may face charges of 
destroying property and driving dangerously 
among the most famous spy swaps on the bridge was the feb 10 
1962 exchange by the united states of convicted soviet kgb master 
spy col rudolph abel for francis gary powers whose u2 
surveillance plane was shot down over the soviet union 
many refugees fled over the bridge to west berlin after the east 
german workers uprising in 1953 but the barriers there had never 
been breached

the federal government needs to step up its 
supervision of clinical laboratories in order to end widespread 
fraud and cut the rate of dangerous and sometimes fatal 
misdiagnoses congress was told thursday 
fraud gross overcharging kickbacks and poor quality of care 
are rampant in this industry and federal oversight has been 
nonexistent said rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations 
dingell said there is a pervasive pattern of highly 
questionable financial arrangements between laboratories and 
doctors with lab inducements ranging from cash discounts and 
frequent flyer mileage to paying the salaries of doctors aides 
some witnesses cited 20 percent to 40 percent error rates in pap 
tests which detect cervical cancer in women as an example of the 
dangers in unregulated lab procedures 
shirley greening representing the american society for 
cytotechnology said labs have adopted a paps for profit 
mentality under which technicians salaries have stagnated while 
their workloads have increased to dangerous levels 
some cytotechs screen 200 to 300 slides a day or more this 
means looking at one pap smear slide every one and a half 
minutes she said screening at this highproduction pace 
produces fatigue and leads to careless errors 
other problems include piecework pay systems that encourage 
production at the expense of careful diagnosis she said and 
considerable pressure to accept inadequate specimens and call 
them negative so doctors wont send their business to another lab 
greening and others recommended mandatory proficiency testing 
for all diagnostic lab technicians workload limits more federal 
money to monitor labs through the medicare and medicaid programs 
and required public disclosure of lab caseload volume staffing 
fees quality control methods and results 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon said one lab was 
billing the state medicaid program 14 for a complete blood 
chemistry test after the investigation he said the price dropped 
to 230 
investigators have recovered 15 million through settlements 
shannon said and massachusetts medicaid is expected to save up to 
700000 a year due to the lower prices 
shannon said such billing practices were a nationwide problem 
dingell cited several federal investigations including one 
still in progress which have found fraud and kickbacks involving 
hundreds of doctors and millions of dollars in southern california 
philadelphia and elsewhere 
he said the profession has become so lucrative that a 
convicted bank robber is now involved in the operation of one 
southwest lab who has exclaimed you can make more money in the 
operation of clinical labs than you can from robbing banks 
there are about 12000 federally regulated labs in the country 
about 6700 located in hospitals several hundred thousand 
facilities are not federally regulated many of them in physicians 
offices 
dingell said the market for clinical lab testing is estimated at 
20 billion a year and 40 percent of that is federally funded 
through medicare and medicaid 
he said representatives of the lab industry would be heard from 
at a later date

prince charles escaped an avalanche 
while skiing today but the snowslide killed one of his friends and 
injured another 
buckingham palace identified the dead man as maj hugh lindsay 
a former equerry or aide to charless mother queen elizabeth ii 
a woman in the party patricia palmertomkinson suffered leg 
injuries the palace said 
the palace said charles was not injured but witnesses said the 
prince looked distraught and one said he was weeping and shaking 
as a helicopter arrived to pick him up 
charles wife diana and sarah ferguson his pregnant 
sisterinlaw were not on the slopes at the time the palace said 
swiss authorities said the snowslide on mt gotschnagrat near 
klosters began about 300 feet above a group of six skiers that 
included prince charles the prince and three other people were 
unharmed 
the palace said the party was skiing off the main ski run and 
was stationary when the avalanche began at 245 pm 
all members of the party were in a position to take avoiding 
action with the exception of maj lindsay and mrs 
palmertomkinson who were both caught in the avalanche it said 
lindsay 34 was a serving army major and a friend of charles 
and diana he was married to a buckingham palace press secretary 
who was expecting a baby the palace said 
peter balsiger editorinchief of the zurichbased newspaper 
blick was quoted as saying he was told charles 39 helped dig one 
person out of the snow 
the palace statement said a swiss guide and members of the royal 
party helped dig the victims free it did not say whether charles 
was among the diggers 
a french photographer told bbc radio he saw charles being 
comforted by someone as a helicopter took off with a stretcher 
bbc tv news said the queen was understood to have spoken to the 
family at the chalet where they gathered after the tragedy 
the 1988 good ski guide describes the run where the accident 
occurred as a slope of awesome steepness dropping about 500 
meters yards 
prince charles skied the area many times during his bachelor 
days and is credited with giving klosters its exclusive tag 
the guide says prince charles is no doubt pleased to have put 
it behind him mercifully it is rarely open 
they avalanches are extremely difficult to predict that is 
what makes them so dangerous said peter cliff an alpine guide 
and leader of the cairngorm mountain rescue team in scotland 
the most common is the snowslab avalanche when snow driven by 
wind creates a crusted surface underlaid with air pockets and is 
liable to fracture across the entire width of a slope 
without warning massive slides can be set off by temperature 
increases new falls of snow or skiers and climbers 
the royals arrived in switzerland on tuesday 
charles diana and the duchess of york who is married to 
charles younger brother prince andrew posed for photographers at 
klosters on wednesday for photographers the 28yearold duchess 
the former sarah ferguson is expecting her first baby in august

illinois blacks will deliver their primary vote 
almost exclusively to favorite son jesse jackson next tuesday but 
black leaders credit the monolithic vote to jacksons charisma and 
not a daleystyle political machine 
jackson who has had his differences with the black hierarchy in 
his adopted hometown of chicago doesnt need a machine to ensure 
the black vote observers say 
this is a movement vote that is bigger than the capabilities 
of any ward committeeman or political organizer said don rose a 
longtime chicago political consultant who predicts jackson will win 
up to 95 percent of the black vote in the illinois primary 
but jacksons supporters are working hard to mobilize that vote 
and more importantly to make sure supporters realize the 
necessity of also voting for jacksons slated convention delegates 
in illinois 
illinois beauty pageant primary is separate from the election 
of 173 delegates to the democratic national convention 
jackson is fielding full delegate slates in only 17 of the 
states 22 congressional districts he is one delegate short in 
four other districts and has no slate in the nearly allwhite 
suburbs on chicagos northwest side 
the black vote alone wont be enough to give jackson a victory 
in the illinois primary and may not be enough to lock up second 
place rose said 
he predicted the black vote would amount to between 23 percent 
and 25 percent of the entire democratic vote in illinois if he 
gets 10 percent of the white vote that would give him 30 percent 
and make it unlikely for him to carry the state rose said 
right now there is a tremendous fervor in the community for 
jesse after the outcome of super tuesday said chicago alderman 
danny davis a black leader and jackson supporter ive heard 
people talking about how it was the second coming 
jackson returned in triumph wednesday to chicago his political 
base for nearly two decades reminding voters i am a charter 
member of the underclass the son of a teenage mother who was the 
daughter of a teenage mother i was able to break the shackles 
jackson rose to national prominence from chicagos predominantly 
black south side where he started a civil rights group called 
operation push in the early 1970s 
he owns a home in a middleclass chicago neighborhood and 
regularly returns to push headquarters to speak at the groups 
weekly saturday meetings which often take on the flavor of a 
church revival meeting 
davis and other political observers predicted that jacksons 
chicago political base would help him win about 95 percent of the 
black vote in illinois and up to 10 percent of the white vote 
roughly the proportions he won in the super tuesday primaries 
but they say hell carry the black vote without relying on the 
type of wardboss political machine that has permeated chicago 
history most recently under the late mayor richard daley 
there is not a black political machine in the formal sense 
said rose who worked for the late mayor harold washington the 
citys first black mayor 
there is a mobilized black vote the product of the harold 
washington years rose said wednesday jesse is able to pull it 
together and he will deliver an overwhelming black vote of 90 
percent to 95 percent 
but thats not the product of anybodys machine rose said 
thats a product of jesses charisma and popularity among black 
voters 
jackson had the support of washington in 1984 and of current 
mayor eugene sawyer this year but he and washington were largely 
allies of political convenience and jackson actively backed 
another black alderman over sawyer in the political fighting that 
followed washingtons death last november 
east st louis mayor carl officer a longtime jackson supporter 
will deliver the democratic contender the bulk of the black vote in 
that southern illinois city said several jackson supporters 
jackson also will be counting on the black church long a 
political base for him to help mobilize voters chicago alderman 
tim evans said on sunday he said black ministers throughout the 
city likely will preach to their parishioners to vote for jackson

a family of musicians demanding to be flown to 
london set off a bomb aboard an aeroflot jet and killed four people 
before an assault team stormed the plane and shot dead five of the 
hijackers tass said today 
the hijackers carried weapons and explosives aboard the plane in 
their instruments the official soviet news agency said in 
addition to the nine dead 20 passengers were reported injured in 
tuesdays hijacking of the tupolev154 plane tass said 
tass identified the 11 air pirates as members of a family 
musical ensemble from siberia known as the ovechkins it gave no 
information on their motives 
the hijackers set off the bomb while the plane with 76 
passengers was on the ground near leningrad tass said 
the government newspaper izvestia said one of the hijackers died 
in the explosion the newspaper said the surviving air pirates then 
killed their leader identified as their mother and that two of 
them committed suicide 
the hijackers seized the plane tuesday as it was headed to 
leningrad after a stop in the ural mountains city of kurgan the 
flight began in the siberian city of irkutsk 
tass reported the incident on wednesday but gave few details 
it was the second hijacking of a soviet domestic flight in 1 years 
us embassy spokesman richard gilbert said today that the 
embassy had been told no americans were aboard 
the sovietskaya rossiya daily reported today that the cockpit 
crew had been relayed a message from the hijackers that they were 
to proceed to london 
the pilots reported what happened to ground control tass 
said they were told that a refueling was needed to meet their 
demand and the airliner made an unscheduled landing 
tass said a special assault team boarded the plane after it 
landed and that the hijackers opened fire 
the bandits managed to set off an explosive device in the 
airliners tail section the plane caught fire the agency 
reported an air hostess and three passengers were killed as a 
result of the act of terrorism 
other passengers were evacuated but 20 were injured and were 
hospitalized tass said 
five of the 11 criminals were killed it stated without 
giving details radio moscow said the other six would be tried in 
court 
the bandits were the ovechkins a family musical group from 
irkutsk in siberia tass said eyewitnesses pointed to three 
leaders among the criminal team vasily and oleg ovechkin and 
their mother ninel ovechkin a plump fashionably dressed woman of 
over 50 
tass said they brought their weapons aboard in their instruments 
sovietskaya rossiya explained that the incident transpired over 
the course of the afternoon 
the jet which can carry up to 168 passengers took off from 
kurgan at 108 pm moscow time the paper said shortly before 3 
pm when the plane was nearing leningrads pulkovo airport one 
of the people aboard demanded that senior flight attendant tamara 
zharkaya take a note to the cockpit 
the note said we demand that you change course fly to 
london otherwise well blow up the plane along with the 
passengers the newspaper reported 
the crew kept their heads the paper said pilot valentin f 
kupriyanov calculated how much fuel was left then landed at an 
unidentified airfield near leningrad 
after landing the crew entered into negotiations with the 
bandits asking them to give up their criminal intentions and not 
to endanger passengers lives the newspaper said 
but the hijackers refused to listen it said 
several hours of negotiations had no result the newspaper 
said 
under these conditions the only decision that could be taken 
was to render the criminals harmless said sovietskaya rossiya 
radio moscow said in the shooting aboard the plane most of 
the hijackers were killed and the others were captured they are 
to be tried in court 
the last airliner hijacking attempt reported in the soviet union 
was on sept 20 1986 in the ural mountains city of ufa media 
reports said the hijackers were armed members of the internal 
security forces the reports said that five people including two 
of the hijackers were killed when authorities stormed the plane 
the others were tried and sentenced 
tuesdays hijack was at least the third fatal incident this year 
involving an aeroflot jet

a tu134 carrying 51 people crashed on feb 27 while landing at 
the siberian city of surgut tass said there were victims but gave 
no details 
reports on aviation accidents and disasters were rare until 
about two years ago when soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
embarked on a campaign for more open discussion of social and 
economic problems 
a civil aviation ministry official said in november that 
aeroflot would begin reporting all injury accidents this year

security police on thursday questioned the 
editor of a churchsponsored magazine after he charged that some 
voters were intimidated by the government in recent primary 
elections a colleague said 
during the feb 22 elections voters were required to line up at 
polling places behind their candidate or someone representing him 
chief editor bedan mbugua called the system a mockery of 
democracy in mondays edition of beyond magazine which is 
sponsored by the national council of churches of kenya he charged 
that some voters were intimidated by administration officials into 
voting for certain candidates 
ibrahim omondi associate editor of beyond said mbugua reported 
to security police but no details of the investigation were 
available 
the general secretary of the kenya african nation union the 
countrys sole legal political party acknowledged mistakes during 
the primary but he accused beyond of sloppy and unfair reporting 
it is onesided and selfserving burudi nabwera said at a 
news conference it is difficult to understand how the magazine 
could have drawn conclusions after looking partially at only five 
constituencies 
general elections on march 21 will be by secret ballot

a former top federal education official has 
some news for parents struggling with college tuition bills 
harold howe ii who was us education commissioner from 196568 
under president lyndon b johnson says that at 12000 a year or 
roughly 60 a day during the academic year a college education is 
a bargain 
howe writing in the march 9 issue of the chronicle of higher 
education offered what he called an incomplete list of all the 
things that 60 buys including 
a room and bath often semiprivate and three meals plus 
heat and electricity 
a variety of free or lowcost cultural social and sports 
events as well as extracurriculars 
special student facilities for socializing and meeting 
members of the opposite sex 
what amounts to a club membership for recreation including 
swimming tennis golf except in cities and other sports 
access to libraries laboratories museums field trips 
and guest lectures 
the services of an army of foodservice clerical and other 
nonacademic employees 
the personal attention of faculty members with a wide range 
of skills and knowledge whose main job is to pass on what they 
know to their students 
free advice from a distinguished group of presidents 
provosts deans and other functionaries who believe that colleges 
should turn out graduates with both a moral compass and a body of 
knowledge 
thats not bad for 60 a day said howe who is now a senior 
lecturer at harvard universitys graduate school of education 
he said students get all that for a daily fee that might get 
you a night but no meals in a holiday inn 
in addition to providing all these services for students 
colleges do great things for society howe said citing studies 
that have found college graduates pay more taxes are more likely 
to vote have a lower divorce rate volunteer more often for good 
works in their communities and are less likely to go to jail 
howe said secretary of education william j bennett who has 
often accused colleges of being overpriced and underproductive 
should consider changing his tune and urging colleges to raise 
tuition so that the goose that lays the golden eggs can continue 
to do so 
instead of responding to bennett with salvos about inadequate 
faculty salaries and increasing maintenance costs college 
presidents should point out what a bargain a college education is 
today howe suggested

a 15yearold boy was convicted of 
seconddegree murder and sentenced to life in prison today for 
beating a classmate to death with a baseball bat so he could see 
what it was like to kill someone 
rod matthews showed no reaction when the verdict was announced 
and his sentence immediately imposed the verdict issued at 210 
pm followed nearly 10 hours of deliberation over two days 
the victims mother sobbed as the verdict was announced and 
matthews mother sat silently with lowered head 
matthews mental state was the focus of closing arguments 
wednesday in norfolk superior court 
the jurors began their work after judge roger j donahue 
explained again the various possible convictions available and 
outlining the basis for acquittal by reason of insanity 
prosecutors who were seeking a firstdegree murder conviction 
for the nov 20 1986 slaying depicted matthews as a 
dispassionate murderer who plotted for weeks to lure 14yearold 
shaun ouillette to a secluded area to find out what it was like 
to kill somebody 
defense attorney john philip white calling for acquittal by 
reason of insanity called matthews an irrational diseased 
intellect who appealed for help before the killing but was 
ignored by a teacher and friends 
matthews tried as an adult had faced a mandatory sentence of 
life imprisonment without parole if convicted of firstdegree 
murder if found guilty of seconddegree murder the maximum 
penalty is life imprisonment with a chance of parole in 15 years 
if matthews had been found innocent by reason of insanity he 
would have been evaluated by the state department of mental health 
white said 
district attorney peter casey portrayed matthews as a troubled 
youth who was prompted to kill by his own desires not by mental 
illness 
he did that because he doesnt care about anybody said 
casey who repeatedly jabbed an accusatory finger at matthews 
during closing arguments what did it feel like it was 
deliberate he really wound up and hit him about the head 
matthews chose ouillette as the victim after rejecting two other 
classmates as targets because two of his friends objected casey 
said 
ouillette who moved to canton with his family about two years 
before the slaying was selected because matthews felt he would not 
be missed according to testimony during the weeklong trial 
matthews said he had plotted the killing for a month to 
experience what killing someone was like according to testimony 
from two classmates who were shown the body by matthews before a 
prethanksgiving pep rally 
ouillettes body was discovered in december 1986 after one of 
the youths sent police an anonymous letter none of the teenagers 
who knew of the slaying faces prosecution 
white depicted matthews as a highly unstable youth whose use of 
ritalin a drug used mainly to control hyperactivity in children 
may have exacerbated his already unstable state 
that contention is a smoke screen casey said citing medical 
experts testimony that ritalin does not permanently alter behavior 
or trigger violence or hallucinations in normal doses 
white also said matthews unsuccessfully sought help prior to the 
slaying in a letter to a teacher in which matthews described his 
desire to kill and light fires 
had they said no dont kill shaun ouillette in all

the cuban prison system is generally 
constructive and humane for cooperative inmates but metes out 
harsh and cruel treatment to those who reject rehabilitation 
programs according to a report released thursday 
the report was prepared by the institute for policy studies a 
liberal research group based in washington which sponsored a visit 
by a sixmember delegation to cuba from feb 26 to march 5 
the delegation which visited six prisons at various locations 
around the island and conducted more than 120 confidential 
interviews said it found a number of constructive aspects to 
the cuban system 
the great majority of prisoners work a regular work week at 
productive jobs under conditions similar to those of ordinary 
workers many acquire practical skills during confinement and have 
opportunities to advance their education 
almost all the prisoners who work are paid receiving the same 
rate as civilians except for certain discounts to cover cost of 
living 
the regular prison facilities were all clean and hygenic there 
were no complaints of the use of instruments of torture and a 
system of conjugal visits was well established 
but the report also found that prisoners who resist reeducation 
or violate prison discipline are confined for extended periods at 
times in extremely harsh punishment cells bare tiny dark 
cold or hot depending on the season sometimes with not enough 
food 
one delegation member aryeh neier said the cells were five 
feet by seven had no bedding only a primitive sanitary system and 
housed three prisoners each 
the delegation said it had heard reports of a few prisoners who 
wore no clothes or only undershorts and shoes 
some prisoners who refuse to work are allowed sun only once a 
week for an hour or two and are confined to iron cages too small to 
take walks the report said 
until recently uncooperative prisoners were allowed visits only 
once every six months but the delegation said new rules have 
reduced this to once every 60 days the report said 
but a cuban exile reinaldo lopez lima who said he spent 23 
years in cuban prisons told neier during the news conference that 
he spent eight of those years without a family visit he described 
prison conditions as terrible and said he knew of a dozen 
prisoners who were killed early last year shortly before his 
release 
under questioning neier said he was satisfied that the 
delegation got an unfettered look at the cuban prison system 
he said it would have been difficult for cuban authorities to 
restrict the delegation to showcase areas reserved for foreign 
visitors because he had maps drawn for the delegation by former 
prisoners 
the visit came at a time when the reagan administration is 
making a concerted effort at the un human rights commission in 
geneva to make cuba an agenda item at the 1989 commission session 
in a speech to the commission on tuesday the us ambassador to 
the united nations vernon walters said that cuba has more than 
200 prisons and labor camps and that there may be between 10000 to 
15000 political prisoners 
he said that a group of longterm political prisoners who have 
refused rehabilitation began a hunger strike a week ago to 
protest havanas attempts to misinform the world about prison 
conditions torture and other mistreatment 
neier noted that amnesty international a londonbased human 
rights group claims to have the names of 600 political prisoners 
and said he believes the actual number in that category is only 
somewhat higher 
the report said that the delegation interviewed at least 50 
political prisoners most of whom the group had selected in advance 
the visit was undertaken at the suggestion of the institute for 
policy studies in exchange ipc agreed to seek similar access to 
us prisons by a delegation of cuban legal experts

rock star george michael has credited 
the wife of democratic presidential candidate albert gore jr with 
helping boost his album sales past 10 million

music

the nicaraguan contras on thursday dropped a demand 
that had blocked peace talks with their homelands marxist 
government agreeing to the open agenda proposed by the sandinistas 
the rebel group made the announcement at a news conference here 
where its leaders bitterly criticized the united states for cutting 
off contra aid 
the united states has once again abandoned an ally said 
adolfo calero one of six directors of the nicaraguan resistance 
but we have been abandoned before we will continue our efforts 
calero said the rebels will now accept the proposed open agenda 
for talks in sapoa nicaragua and suggested the talks begin march 
16 
we are ready to go to sapoa said calero who will head the 
delegation 
he said the nicaraguan resistance as the contras are formally 
known would no longer insist that the agenda include a program 
hammered out during talks mediated by nicaraguan cardinal miguel 
obando y bravo in guatemala last month that included a 30day 
truce political amnesty press freedoms an end to the draft and 
a dialogue with the opposition 
the contras proposed instead that the sandinistas allow the 
internal opposition to attend the talks but stopped short of 
saying they would insist on that condition 
the change in the contras position came one week after a reagan 
administration proposal to continue funding the rebels lost in a 
close vote in the us house of representatives on march 3 
calero called the united states an inconsistent and 
impermanent friend in contrast to the soviets who support the 
sandinistas 
he and fellow director aristides sanchez said the aid cutoff 
might eventually hurt troops in the field but insisted their 
morale was still high 
we will never surrender said calero 
the sandinistas have previously accepted contra demands that 
obando y bravo whom the nicaraguan government dropped as mediator 
attend the sapoa talks as a witness 
the contras in turn accepted organization of american states 
head javier baena soares as a second witness 
calero said thursday that in previous communications the 
sandinistas have given every guarantee of the contra 
delegations safety inside nicaragua 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega had proposed the sapoa talks 
begin march 9 but the contras begged off saying they were only 
notified the night of march 7 
last week they asked instead for a meeting in costa rica to 
discuss details of the talks but thursdays proposal made no 
mention of a preliminary meeting 
calero said he had kept the united states which he referred to 
as our ally in quotes informed of the talks

bankruptcy was discharged from miami federal court in january and 
all of gibbs debts were settled 
since then gibb was back on his feet and in good spirits and 
trying to put together a record contract he said

gary hart who three months ago reentered the 
democratic presidential race to let the people decide has 
gotten the message and will call it quits on friday sources said 
thursday 
the former colorado senator polled no more than 5 percent of the 
vote in the super tuesday primaries and won no convention 
delegates the day after the primaries the federal election 
commission announced hart no longer was eligible for further 
federal matching funds 
his departure from the race expected to come at a friday 
morning news conference in denver will mark his second departure 
from the 1988 democratic race 
at a highly charged news conference last may 8 a defiant hart 
at the time considered the democratic frontrunner quit the race 
following published reports about his relationship with miami model 
donna rice 
when he rejoined the race in december hart immediately shot to 
the top of the polls but pollsters cautioned harts numbers could 
be traced to name identification rather than support and early 
contests bore that out hart finished last in crucial early races 
in iowa and new hampshire 
sources speaking only on condition of anonymity said hart would 
not endorse any of the surviving contenders when he makes his 
withdrawal announcement 
in lansing mich george sallade cochairman of michigan 
friends for gary hart said harts speech scheduled for friday to a 
michigan state university political science class had been 
canceled he said he expected a withdrawal announcement 
what this shows is that the american people expect the 
occupant of the white house to be saintly sallade said 
the hart campaign suffered an additional blow when colorado gov 
roy romer and state democratic party chairman buie seawell threw 
their support behind massachusetts gov michael dukakis on 
wednesday both previously had been hart supporters and seawell 
once headed harts senate office in washington dc

many people would like to see students 
perform community services and a bill in the legislature would 
require all michigan high school students to do that to graduate 
critics of the measure say students should concentrate on 
academics such service should be voluntary and the state 
shouldnt intrude on local control of education 
the bill introduced wednesday by sen jerome hart would require 
students to perform 40 hours of community service over the last 
three years of high school it also would let them earn at least 
onehalf course credit if they performed an additional 50 hours of 
service 
rhett johnston an aide to hart said about 5 percent of the 
schools nationwide require community service as a condition of 
graduation about 28 percent of the nations 74000 public high 
schools offer elective course credit for volunteer work 
community service offers our young people the chance to 
discover develop and display talents and skills they rarely use in 
school and it also provides hardpressed community social agencies 
a corps of hardworking dedicated and compassionate volunteers 
hart said 
its pretty widespread said barbara gomez director of 
schoolsanctioned youth community service programs for the 
washingtonbased council of chief state school officers which 
represents state school superintendents 
its a grassroots effort thats filtering up to the state 
level there seems to be a big movement on voluntary service i 
dont think its something that is going to go away 
our stance is that its another way of learning what goes 
on in the classroom is not the only way a child can learn gomez 
said 
two school districts in michigan detroit and bloomfield hills 
require community service to graduate paid parttime jobs 
satisfy the requirement in detroit 
you require what you value we think this is a valuable 
experience said gary doyle deputy superintendent for the 
affluent bloomfield hills school district reaching out and 
helping others gives students a better sense of self 
but some education officials dont like the idea 
it should be determined locally if its going to be a 
mandate we would probably oppose it said don elliott executive 
director of the michigan association of school administrators 
it may well be a good idea but it should be something that 
each school district should consider on its own said justin 
king executive director of the michigan association of school 
boards 
our position is any graduation requirement should be a matter 
of local control said carl cohen president of the michigan 
pta we think that community service should be something that 
everybody should want to do

crews delicately 
dismantled the pedalpowered plane daedalus on thursday and packed 
it up for the start of a journey to greece where the 70pound 
aircraft will attempt a record 74mile flight over the aegean sea 
pilots rolled the plane which resembles a monstrous pink 
dragonfly onto the tarmac at the dryden flight research facility 
where it sat in stark contrast to the giant 747 shuttle piggyback 
jetliner at the nasa facility 
engineers then separated the daedalus wings packed the aircraft 
into a container and loaded it into a moving van a planned 
demonstration flight was called off because of high winds in the 
mojave desert 65 miles north of los angeles 
daedalus will travel to masachusetts and will leave for athens 
aboard a c130 transport on march 23 the target date for the 
flight attempt is march 30 
the aircraft has been undergoing tests in southern california 
since october in preparation for the greek islands flight the 
route originally designed to duplicate the mythological daedalus 
route from crete to the greek mainland was changed slightly to 
ensure lighter winds 
greek mythology dictates that daedalus became the worlds first 
mortal to fly when he manufactured wings of wax and feathers 
according to the story his son icarus died because he flew too 
near the sun and the wax melted 
the daedalus was designed and built by a team of students 
faculty and alumni from mit it will be pedaled between crete and 
santorini by one of five world class bicycle racers currently in 
training 
if successful the flight could last up to seven hours and would 
break the distance record for humanpowered flight set in january 
1987 when the eagle experimental airplane flew 372 miles over the 
mojave desert 
the previous record was set in 1979 when the gossamer albatross 
crossed the english channel 
the daedalus can travel at an altitude of 15 feet with a top 
speed of 14 mph and stretches 30 feet from propeller to tail the 
pilot sits in a plastic cocoon dangling from a 112foot long 
styrofoam wing a 10foot propeller spins four feet from the 
pilots face 
when in flight the temperature in the cockpit increases 20 
degrees because of the exertion of the pilot designers feel they 
have until may 15 to make the record attempt after that the 
weather will be too hot 
the pilot will be selected by lottery 
one of those in training greg zack 26 of wilmington nc 
said he was physically prepared 
it would be a big bummer if i didnt go zack said the 
whole project has been a team thing though so no one will be 
flying alone i can live with it if im not flying it 
he added its a funny plane to fly its a lot of fun 
theres not much to it really you can look around and enjoy 
flying you arent busy with the controls 
heat and winds are the only adversaries he said if there are 
gusts more than 5 mph then you try to guess where it is going to 
take you and try to keep control zack said 
the other potential pilots are frank scioscia 27 scranton 
pa glenn tremml 28 new haven conn erik schmidt 25 boulder 
colo and kanellos kanellopoulos 30 vrahneika greece

at first louisianas chief financial

employees to limit their restroom time or face some surprising 
reminders 
in the march 1 memo a restroom trip policy is outlined to 
provide a consistent method of accounting for each employees 
restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of all state employees 
all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper roll 
retractors the memo said if the stall is occupied for more 
than three minutes an alarm will sound thirty seconds after the 
alarm sounds the roll of paper in the stall will retract the 
toilet will flush and the stall door will open 
but after his initial amusement brian kendrick the states 
commissioner of administration started thinking about how the memo 
was being spread and whether that meant the state could economize 
on some office machinery 
if we can find out where those copies are starting well go 
in and take out some copiers he said 
if i had a dollar for every copy thats been made i could 
have probably solved the states money problems kendrick said 
wednesday louisiana faces a budget deficit projected as high as

counseling and education services be made available to people being 
tested for aids and for those close to them who are at risk of

according to sponsors the legislation would restrict release of 
the results of aids tests without a persons consent to the 
individuals being tested and to professionals directly involved in 
the medical care of that person some information could be 
exchanged by public health and social services agencies sponsors 
said 
the bill protects confidentiality protects the information 
except to deal with an identified and legitimate health concern and 
treatment necessity said state assemblyman richard gottfried 
chairman of the assemblys health committee you would not notify 
everybody in the neighborhood of the presence of aids you would 
not notify somebodys fellow workers 
sponsors say the bill would limit discrimination against people 
with aids the hiv virus or with aidsrelated complex in 
employment housing credit transactions and other areas 
a violation of the disclosure rules would carry a misdemeanor 
criminal penalty of up to one year in jail under the bill which 
also would establish improper disclosure as grounds of a civil 
lawsuit 
current state laws require physicians to inform people when they 
are at risk of getting certain sexually transmitted diseases such 
as syphilis the legislation proposed wednesday would make aids 
notification optional for doctors and it would also give doctors 
the right to ask public health officials to do the notifying 
instead 
tim sweeney deputy director for policy of the new york 
citybased gay mens health crisis said that a strong 
confidentiality bill can enhance public health and civil 
liberties 
new york state with 14000 aids cases has the nations highest 
incidence of the disease aids is caused by a virus that damages 
the bodys immune system it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring

a man who was twice acquitted of charges he 
violated oak parks handgun ban has sued the community and several 
of its officials for 25 million 
in the lawsuit filed wednesday in us district court don 
bennett accuses the suburban village several officials and police 
officers of conspiring to harass him and violate his constitutional 
rights to free speech due process and equal protection under the 
law 
bennett 45 a resident of the nearby hanover park formerly 
owned a gas station and minimarket in oak park 
bennetts attorney michael d johnson said bennett sold his 
business in july after he was harassed by the village and its 
officials because of his outspoken opposition to the ban on 
handguns 
the oak park attorney raymond heise said he had not received a 
copy of the lawsuit but he denied the allegations 
if mr bennett interpreted that enforcement as harassment 
thats his interpretation he said i dont know any day that 
he wasnt free to operate his business 
on march 26 1986 bennett was charged with violating the 
handgun ban after he chased and shot at two people who robbed his 
gas station bennett was acquitted that fall 
the lawsuit contends a police officer told bennett the following 
day to stop talking with the news media about his case johnson 
said 
bennett was charged with a second violation of the handgun ban 
on feb 23 1987 accused of brandishing a firearm while dealing 
with an unruly customer he was later acquitted of that charge 
too johnson said

the sole resident of this unincorporated 
town has been fatally shot in the country store he tended for 42 
years and a man paroled from prison three weeks ago has been 
charged with his murder 
william mellin 70 was shot in the back of the head tuesday 
night officials said 
david ray wareham 41 who had worked at the store since his 
parole feb 18 was arrested an hour after the shooting and is 
being held without bail on murder charges officials said he also 
was charged with the attempted murder of a witness to the shooting 
whom police refused to identify 
wareham apparently went to work at the stide 25 percent of the funds 
for the giant atom 
smasher 
herrington said that should the united states fail to build the 
physics research center there could be a brain drain of 
mammoth proportions as us scientists go abroad to work on the 
best equipment 
he urged congress to help the united states take the lead in 
highenergy physics and let the brain drain happen in other 
countries 
the subcommittees chairman rep tom bevill dala pressed 
herrington to get financial commitments from foreign nations before 
congress votes further money for the project 
unless we can get allocated another billion dollars pretty 
soon and start it we could not possibly initiate the funding 
bevill said but if we had assurance 50 percent or 75 percent 
would be contributed by other countries it would be a whole new 
game 
herrington however said it was up to the united states to act 
first in order to draw foreign participation 
rep carl pursell rmich said he was worried that depending 
on some foreign nations such as japan for funds would endanger 
us commercial and security interests 
the project may be pure physics in itself but there are 
results that will translate into the industrial and strategic 
area said pursell whose district contains one of seven proposed 
sites for the supercollider 
president reagan has proposed 363 million for supercollider 
construction in 1989 but critics in congress oppose such high 
spending on grounds it would divert money from other important 
research projects 
the research center would include a 53milearound atom smasher 
to study the effects of highspeed collisions of subatomic 
particles 
backers of the project contend it would produce practical 
technological benefits into the next century 
bevill however said 6 billion in large federally backed 
research projects have been discontinued the past five years 
that isnt a good track record he said when you make 
mistakes on a small research project that is one thing but when 
we look at the size of this it shocks us 
besides michigan six other states have sites that remain in 
competition for the project which will produce 3000 jobs and have 
an annual operating budget of 279 million 
the states are arizona colorado illinois north carolina 
tennessee and texas

a marine embassy guard who for a time figured 
prominently in last years moscow spy scandal will leave the 
military next month the marine corps said thursday 
cpl arnold bracy 22 of woodside queens new york city will 
be formally discharged on april 4 the corps said a marine 
official who asked not to be named said bracy would receive an 
honorable discharge 
bracy served as an embassy guard in moscow with sgt clayton j 
lonetree 26 who was convicted last august of passing classified 
information to soviet agents after becoming involved with a russian 
woman 
for a time last spring bracy also faced a military 
courtmartial because navy and federal agents were convinced he had 
conspired with lonetree and allowed russian kgb agents inside the 
embassy late at night to roam at will 
those allegations were based in part on a confession signed by 
bracy after a lengthy interrogation bracy later recanted that 
statement saying it had been coerced and all charges against him 
were dropped when military lawyers concluded they did not have any 
corroborating evidence to prosecute

former black panther johnny spain was 
freed on bail today after 21 years in prison for murder in 
connection with a bloody aborted 1971 escape attempt from san 
quentin prison 
spain 38 whose two murder convictions were reversed arrived 
at the front gate of the california medical facility shortly after 
noon to receive congratulations from friends and supporters 
i feel great he said what this has meant in terms of 21 
years in prison it has been a very terrible and difficult time i 
wont let anyone down who has supported me and there have been many 
who supported me 
on wednesday us district judge thelton henderson ordered 
spain released on 350000 bail pending a hearing on the states 
appeal of the overturning of the convictions in the slaying of two 
guards during the escape attempt 
friends prepared to post the bond but vacaville officials 
decided not to release him immediately because they had not 
received the necessary papers from the state parole board and the 
judge who ordered him freed 
arguments are scheduled for monday in the states appeal of 
hendersons 1986 order of a new trial for spain in the san 
quentin six case 
mr spain is entitled to sit and watch that argument and hear 
the rest of his life debated before him lawyer dennis riordan 
said in asking henderson for spains immediate release 
the bail ruling was the second court victory in as many days for 
spain who was imprisoned being arrested in 1966 for a murder and 
robbery in los angeles 
on tuesday los angeles superior court judge kathleen parker 
ordered spain paroled immediately from the sentence he has been 
serving for the 1966 murder 
spain apparently joined the black panther party after entering 
prison he later became the only inmate convicted of murder in the 
bloody san quentin escape attempt that killed militant leader 
george jackson two other prisoners and three guards 
authorities said spain who was seen running out of a 
maximumsecurity unit with jackson conspired with jackson in the 
attempted breakout 
the other members of the san quentin six were either convicted 
of lesser charges or acquitted 
in reversing spains convictions and granting him a new trial 
henderson said spain had been denied a fair trial by being required 
to wear heavy shackles for every court appearance during the five 
years of proceedings 
in december the state board of prison terms rejected spains 
request for parole saying he was unsuitable for release 
henderson however ordered a new hearing finding that the board 
had violated his previous order not to consider the overturned san 
quentin convictions in its deliberations 
on feb 11 the board voted 21 to grant spain parole in 1989 a 
dissenting board member asked for review by the full ninemember 
board which is scheduled march 21 
spains lawyers said he would live in san francisco and work as 
an electrician while his case is on appeal hendersons order 
allows him to travel within the state and visit his wife whom he 
married while in prison and two young sons in los angeles

in a bid to revitalize the flagging nuclear 
power industry 14 members of congress introduced legislation 
thursday to encourage standardized plant designs and streamline the 
governments regulatory force 
rep carlos j moorhead rcalif said the bill provides the 
means to assure that the nuclear power option is preserved for 
the future it is cosponsored by eight republicans and five 
democrats most of whom serve with moorhead on the house energy 
subcommittee that will initially consider the bill 
the legislation would reorganize the fivemember nuclear 
regulatory commission into a nuclear safety agency headed by a 
single administrator a step already approved by a senate 
subcommittee and favored by a majority of the nrc commissioners 
themselves all other federal regulatory agencies are headed by 
just one boss and the nrcs commission format has long come under 
fire from industry and congress as too cumbersome 
unlike the senate measure moorheads bill would take the 
additional step of authorizing onestop licensing of future nuclear 
plants if they are built to standard stateoftheart designs 
currently nuclear plants must be licensed in several stages 
from the start of construction to the actual production of power 
years later that is necessary in part because most us plants 
have been built to custom designs different from any other 
and hence must be given more scrupulous review 
moorheads bill would encourage the new safety agency to license 
both the construction and operation of any plant subject to normal 
inspections which adheres to precleared designs the system would 
be similar to those used in france and japan both of which rely 
heavily on nuclear power and produce it more cheaply 
enormous costs safety concerns and the lengthy complicated 
licensing process are among factors blamed for the moribund state 
of the us nuclear industry though 110 plants are now in 
operation and a few are still under construction no utility has 
even applied to build a new plant since 1978 
nrc chairman lando zech and even some critics of nuclear power 
have long argued for plant standardization on both safety and 
financial grounds some american firms say they now have the 
technology to design meltdownproof reactors which if 
standardized would be less expensive perhaps by more than half 
than the plants that now require containment structures and massive 
backup safety systems 
moorhead noting that the us geological survey has just cut 
its estimate of undiscovered oil in the united states by 40 
percent said it is undeniably clear that in the 1990s and 
beyond this country will have inadequate supplies of electricity 
instead of having oil buried in the ground it now appears that we 
have had our heads buried its time we face the facts quickly and 
develop alternative energy supplies 
rep michael bilirakis rfla pointed to an example in his own 
state as evidence of the advantages offered by plant 
standardization the st lucie 2 power plant built to the same 
specifications as its sister st lucie 1 recently was licensed 
for operation after 15 billion in construction costs he said 
in contrast bilirakis continued the long island shoreham 
plant which is the same size as st lucie 2 cost more than 5 
billion if we can keep nuclear plant construction costs below 2 
billion by building the same design only twice he said imagine 
what we can save if we build a standardized plant many times over 
we rely on nuclear power for nearly 20 percent of our electric 
generation said bilirakis yet the construction of nuclear 
power plants is at a standstill the volatile situation today in 
the persian gulf points out that we simply must continue to develop 
domestic energy sources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil 
safe reliable nuclear power is the means at hand to do just that

president kurt waldheim himself accused 
of war crimes apologized on austrias behalf thursday for 
atrocities austrian nazis committed after adolf hitler made his 
native land part of germany 50 years ago 
we must not forget that many of the worst nazi hangmen were 
austrians he said in a tv speech there were austrians who 
were victims and others who were perpetrators as head of state of 
the republic of austria i wish to apologize for nazi crimes 
committed by austrians 
about 15000 viennese gathered for a rally outside city hall on 
the first of four solemn days marking the anschluss of march 
11 1938 when german troops marched into austria and were greeteed 
by cheering crowds 
among the speakers were survivors of concentration camps and 
paul grosz who leads viennas community of 6000 jews 
austrias jews cannot forget that 65000 were killed by the 
nazis and many more thousands had to flee grosz said we should 
never let that stain of shame on the history of this city be 
forgotten he declared 
security was tight because of a bomb scare early thursday 
police removed cars parked nearby two hours before the rally began 
city officials prepared thousands of black ribbons bearing the 
words 50 years march 1938 never again 
an exhibit called vienna 1938 has been mounted at city hall 
there are similar displays about the nazi era at linz where hitler 
spent his youth salzburg innsbruck and graz where the nazi 
swastika was raised over the city hall even before german troops 
arrived 
dozens of events are planned during the four days 
waldheim canceled a speech he was to have made at the official 
government ceremony friday some prominent austrians had 
threatened to stay away otherwise and substituted the televised 
address thursday in which he spoke of the avalanche of 
suffering after annexation 
he did not mention his own service in hitlers army or a report 
last month on his conduct as a lieutenant in the balkans from 1942 
to 1945 
an international panel of historians appointed by the 
government at waldheims request said he was in close 
proximity to war crimes knew of them and did not try to stop 
them the historians said they found no proof that he committed war 
crimes but left the question of guilt open 
in his 12minute speech thursday the former un 
secretarygeneral indicated again that he will not leave office 
until his term expires in 1992 he announced plans for a moral 
renewal program to counter disillusionment among young austrians 
about public service 
at the rally grosz told the young you are not the prisoners 
of an evil past because if you know it you are free to form the 
present and the future creatively 
hundreds of thousands of austrians joined the nazi party after 
cheering german soldiers who poured across the border march 1112 
1938 made austria part of the third reich 
huge crowds welcomed hitler when he entered his homeland in 
triumph by then thousands of jews intellectuals socialists and 
austrian nationalists had been jailed in a roundup overseen by ss 
chief heinrich himmler 
the nazis said 99 percent of austrias voters approved the 
annexation in a nationwide referendum in april 1938 
austrians as both victims and perpetrators of nazism was a theme 
running through all pronouncements of major public figures as the 
anniversary observance began 
chancellor franz vranitzky said in an interview with western 
news agencies that austrians should learn from the past rather than 
focusing on waldheim 
in a survey conducted for a television documentary 47 percent 
of 150 austrians polled late last year said annexation brought both 
good and bad results only 15 percent of those polled said it was 
entirely bad 
after 1918 when austria lost its vast empire politicians of 
all parties had argued for union with germany as a way to rescue 
the economy and preserve the nations german culture the 
enthusiasm of many wanted when hitler gained control of germany in 
1933 
vranitzky said an important lesson of the 1930s was that 
divisions between political parties never should be so deep again 
after world war ii the past was suppressed the official view 
came to be that austria was hitlers first victim the controversy 
over waldheims wartime past has prompted a much more thorough 
investigation of the past 
mayor helmut zilk unveiling a plaque to vienna politicians who 
died in concentration camps said thursday some austrian victims 
very quickly searched for victims of their own after 1938 
we must openly admit this disgraceful fact and we should not 
try to minimize it or play it down by a comparison with other 
countries he said

republican union members against the wishes 
of their leaders appear to be embracing the presidential candidacy 
of kansas sen bob dole despite his poor record on labor issues 
democrats far outnumber republicans in organized labor and 
democratic union members like democrats in general have yet to 
unite behind any of their partys candidates 
but dole despite having what has been called one of the 20 
worst voting records in the senate on labor issues is the clear 
favorite of union members who say they are republicans about 
about onefourth of the 19 million union members in the nation 
dole for example garnered 53 percent of the republican union 
vote in tuesdays 12 southern primaries according to exit polls 
but with only 1 percent of the republican vote in the southern 
primaries coming from union households their support for dole was 
no more than a drop in the bucket as vice president george bush 
swept the region 
bush received 28 percent of the republican union vote in the 
super tuesday primaries followed by former television evangelist 
pat robertson with 22 percent and rep jack kemp of new york with 6 
percent 
labor political strategists see primarily two phenomena at work 
in the strong support for dole and in bushs weak showing among 
their republican members 
dole is perceived incorrectly as less elitist more moderate 
and more of a regular guy said jerry clark political director 
of the 1 millionmember american federation of state county and 
municipal employees 
except on a few things like food stamps that affect 
agriculture his voting record on our issues is terrible clark 
said 
the other factor is bushs identification with president reagan 
who despite the aflcios vehement opposition received about 45 
percent of union members votes in the 1984 general election 
rex hardesty a spokesman for the federation contended doles 
strong showing this year represents an antireagan vote 
the drumbeat of union publications that reaganomics and 
reagans conservative views should hold no appeal to trade 
unionists is getting through he said 
reagan had support from just two unions in 1980 the teamsters 
and the professional air traffic controllers organization within a 
year of his election he fired 11000 patco members for going on 
strike and destroyed their union 
the teamsters endorsed reagan again in 1984 but with much less 
enthusiasm than in 1980 later the administration indicted their 
president jackie presser on charges of embezzlement and launched 
a legal effort to seize control of the union through a government 
trusteeship contending that it is dominated by racketeers 
in reaction to the takeover attempt the teamsters sought refuge 
in the aflcio rejoining the federation after a 30year absence 
and promising to not disrupt its political goal of putting a 
democrat in the white house 
although they are now unlikely to make a democratic endorsement 
before the partys convention next july labor leaders have agreed 
to unite behind whoever is the partys nominee 
joan baggett political director for the bricklayers union and a 
democratic party activist said labor leaders clearly prefer to run 
against bush believing fewer of their members will cross over to 
support him than did reagan 
bush is now clearly linked with reagan and our members have 
come to realize that reagan has not been particularly good for 
their interests ms baggett said 
we dont want to run against dole she added he has a 
long voting record against our members interests but they dont 
know that its partly because that with our lower political 
profile this year we havent told them 
not everyone agrees 
dole drew fewer negative responses than any other candidate in 
either party in a poll of members of the united food and commercial 
workers union 
if our members have a preference as far as republicans are 
concerned they would much rather have dole said allen zack a 
ufcw spokesman hes developed a reputation as being at least a 
person you can deal with

amnesty international officials accused 
gov bob martinez on thursday of trying to rush the execution of 
convicted killer willie jasper darden floridas mostoften 
condemned man who is under his seventh death warrant 
officials of amnesty international and other groups planned to 
go to the state capitol on friday to ask martinez to meet with 
dardens attorneys and listen to new evidence that they say could 
clear the inmate of the murder of a lakeland furniture store owner 
in a 15 robbery 
supporters say darden who is black was the victim of racial 
prejudice in his trial 
dardens is the mostlitigated case involving a death row 
inmate with nearly 100 judges involved in decisions it has been 
before the us supreme court four times 
the latest time before the supreme court was monday when the 
court turned down his claim that he received an unfair trial 
the next day the governor signed a seventh death warrant for 
darden and set his execution for march 15 that gave the inmates 
attorneys less than a week to prepare his case usually at least 
30 days are allowed 
i think the governor is looking for some kind of ritualistic 
sacrifice that he can go through to prove hes tough on crime 
said magdaleno roseavila national director of amnesty 
internationals campaign to abolish the death penalty he noted 
that the governors popularity rating has been low in recent polls 
the governors spokesman said politics had nothing to do it 
since martinez always has strongly supported the death penalty 
the issues have been debated and resolved by the courts there 
was no reason not to sign the warrant said press secretary jon 
peck 
peck said martinez had instituted a new policy recently to 
schedule executions on subsequent warrants in 20 days rather than 
30 days which he said would have put the execution near the good 
friday and easter holidays 
it seemed like kind of an inappropriate time peck said 
joe spicola the governors general counsel said darden had 
exhausted all possible appeals he is not going to abuse the 
process any further he said 
attorney mark olive said he did not know when he would be able 
to file a lastditch appeal on dardens behalf 
amnesty international planned to organize supporters in florida 
and european countries to call or cable the governors office 
friday to protest the execution 
i think there will be public outrage like theyve never seen 
if they execute willie darden roseavila said 
no other florida inmate has survived as many death warrants few 
have been as celebrated and only one other inmate has been on 
floridas death row longer 
when martinez signed dardens sixth death warrant earlier this 
year soviet dissident andrei sakharov american actress margot 
kidder and british rock star peter gabriel urged clemency sakharov 
won the 1975 nobel peace prize for his defense of human rights in 
the soviet union 
darden 54 has been on death row since jan 29 1974 a 
prolific writer he has been called the poet of death row 
dardens supporters cite sworn statements from a minister and 
another lakeland resident saying he could not have been at the 
furniture store when owner james turman was killed 
the rev sam sparks said turmans wife had told him that all 
blacks looked alike to her and that her identification of darden 
was unimportant because lawyers had told her darden committed the 
crime helen baum formerly helen turman recently denied having 
made that statement to sparks and reaffirmed her identification of 
darden 
christine f bass a lakeland secretary said dardens car had 
broken down near her home and he waited for a tow truck from 4 pm 
to 535 pm on sept 8 1973 her house was eight miles from the 
furniture store prosecutors say the crime occurred about 6 pm

nasa officials warned congress on thursday 
that the space station program would be destroyed if money is 
diverted to build an unmanned scientific and manufacturing facility 
in space 
at the same time the space station budget came under attack 
elsewhere in the capitol when rep edward p boland dmass 
pressed for more money for housing programs next year and said if 
that money is not allocated then congress will kiss goodbye to 
the space station 
boland whose house appropriations subcommittee handles funding 
for housing programs as well as independent agencies including the 
national aeronautics and space administration said his panel would 
take money for housing from the budgets for nasa and the national 
science foundation unless congress changes the overall budget 
priorities 
boland said it would take 15 billion to restore the cuts 
in housing funds to the level needed unless congress finds another 
source for those funds he said you can kiss goodbye to the 
space station new rocket boosters and other improvements in the 
space program 
in another part of the capitol andrew stofan the retiring head 
of the space station program in the national aeronautics and space 
administration said he would strenuously oppose any attempt to 
take money from the space station budget to pay for a commerically 
developed industrial space facility 
nasa which is under congressional and white house pressure to 
make use of an unmanned scientific and manufacturing facility 
recently said it would seek to lease an orbiting laboratory for 
five years at 140 million a year some congressmen want that money 
to come out of space station funds 
i see no use for it the isf as far as developing the space 
station is concerned said stofan who is retiring after 30 years 
with nasa if the 700 million came out of developing the space 
station i would definitely say no 
some nasa officials and members of congress fear that forcing 
the agency to accept the isf or another facility like it is a move 
by station opponents to kill the project altogether 
stofan testified at a hearing of the house space science 
subcommittee which is considering the administrations request for 
1 billion in the fiscal year that beings in october to start 
construction of the space station 
if we get less than the 1 billion we ask for we will have 
a program but not on the schedule we have today stofan said he 
said any skips in the schedule waste far more money than they save 
after budget cutters got through nasas 1988 request for 767 
million for the space station was cut to 425 million 
that 350 million less will cost us 14 billion by the time 
the station is completed stofan said and he said it will 
delay completion of the station by one year 
he said any cut in the nasa budget will have disastrous results 
just as the agency is trying to spring forward again from the 
calamities that began with the explosion of the space shuttle 
challenger in 1986 nasa has requested 115 billion in 1989 an 
increase of 25 billion over 1988 
rep jack buechner rmo who is a member of the house budget 
committee as well as the space science subcommittee said he 
thought nasa will get only a 1 billion increase 
as we are standing on the springboard ready to dive in the 
water they are draining the pool he said 
the schedule stofan said calls for the first elements of the 
station to be launched in the first three months of 1995 it will 
be ready for temporary visits by astronauts a year later and will 
be completed in the first three months of 1998 
again and again stofan was asked by committee members about the 
industrial space facility 
he said the private houston firm that is developing the facility 
which would be carried into orbit by the space shuttle tried to 
find commercial customers for it but couldnt under the nasa 
proposal the government would lease back 70 percent of the space 
there is no advantage to building the isf before the space 
station is ready stofan said he said it should be built only if 
there is a commercial demand for it 
thomas moser director of the nasas space station program 
office said the isf would have only double the usefulness of 
carrying a spacelab in the shuttles cargo bay he said a 
permanently manned space station would be 50 times as useful as the 
isf

a 150000 payment to a friend of attorney 
general edwin meese iii for work on an iraqi pipeline project ended 
up in a stocktrading account that was apparently used to benefit 
meeses finances a published report said thursday 
the money a legal fee intended for attorney e robert wallach 
went through two accounts before being deposited in october 1985 in 
a pooled account used to trade stocks on behalf of wallach meese 
and others docments obtained by the los angeles times showed 
the discovery indicates the fees wallach received for lobbying 
the white house with meeses help on the pipeline project were 
later used to meeses financial advantage despite vigorous denials 
by lawyers for both meese and wallach the paper said 
meese played a key role in securing us government support for 
the iraqi pipeline when he arranged a white house meeting between 
pipeline promoters and former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane and discussed the project with former israeli prime 
minister shimon peres 
meeses lawyers denied meese knew anything about the payment to 
wallach and said he had no way of knowing of any possible benefits 
he might have received from the money 
and george g walker wallachs attorney told the times we 
will categorically deny that any monies mr wallach received ever 
went into mr meeses account or were used for his benefit 
but highly unusual stocktrading practices by w franklyn chinn 
the financial adviser who managed both meeses and wallachs money 
suggest that meese did benefit from trades made with the wallach 
fee the newspaper said 
a swiss financier bruce rappaport who was the pipelines chief 
promoter said he deposited the 150000 with chinn who controlled 
accounts for wallach and meese at the time rappaport has said he 
hired wallach because of his washington contacts including meese 
the payment to chinn was made less than two months after meese 
helped wallach arrange a meeting between rappaport and mcfarlane on 
june 24 1985 mcfarlane assigned a national security council aide 
to find a way to insure the pipeline so that it could be financed 
and built the pipeline was never constructed 
chinn was able to pool the 150000 with other funds and use the 
money to buy blocks of stock he then could allocate the most 
profitable trades to meeses account after learning how the deals 
came out according to a recent report by the democratic staff of 
the senate governmental affairs oversight subcommittee 
the senate staff report concludes that nearly a third of the 
stock purchases allocated by chinn to meeses account called meese 
partners required more money than his account contained at the 
time they were made 
over an 18month period chinn was able to turn about 50000 
into about 95000 through investments for meese a return of 
better than 80 percent 
last week in geneva rappaport said the 150000 was transferred 
to chinns business account at the bank of america in san francisco 
in august 1985 on instructions from wallach 
a government investigator who reviewed the financial records of 
meese wallach and chinn said that on aug 15 1985 chinn 
transferred 150000 from his bank of america business account to 
the stock trading account he maintained for his business at the san 
francisco office of bear stearns amp co a brokerage house 
chinn maintained several trading accounts for clients at bear 
stearns including the one for meese 
independent counsel james c mckay is investigating meese 
chiefly because of his role in the pipeline affair key to this 
aspect of the inquiry is a 1985 memo to meese in which wallach 
cited a proposal to make payments to the israeli labor party in 
return for israels guarantee not to interfere with the pipeline to 
be built by iraq its longtime enemy

no the boy replied after a while it gets boring 
in remarks to hospital workers and patients gore said he would 
overhaul federal medicaid and medicare programs and other health 
services preferably without a tax increase 
im not proposing additional taxes he said i believe 
that by changing priorities eliminating wasteful spending in areas 
that have been intentionally overlooked by the reagan 
administration it is possible to avoid a tax increase 
i have indicated that it cant be completely ruled out

legislation to protect consumers of infant formulas and to make it 
easier for children to get organ transplants

the nations potential onshore oil discoveries 
may be about 40 percent less than had been believed according to 
new studies by the us geological survey 
using a new method of estimation the survey concluded there is 
a 5050 chance that undiscovered crude oil totals 334 billion 
barrels well below the 546 billion estimated in a 1981 study 
according to figures provided to scientists at a research meeting 
in denver last week 
ozzie girard deputy assistant director for engineering geology 
said thursday the major part of the change came from disappointing 
drilling results 
but some of the change results from a much lower price 
prevailing over the last two years when the latest work was done 
the 1981 work assumed a price of 30 a barrel while the new study 
assumes a price of 18 
the survey believes that the uncertainty of the estimates is 
just as important as the estimates themselves it said there is a 
90 percent chance that undiscovered oil lies between 196 billion 
barrels and 519 billion barrels that range in 1981 was 417 
billion barrels to 71 billion barrels 
the estimates do not include known reserves outlined by actual 
drilling or probable reserves believed to be findable in or 
adjacent to a known field if new exploratory drilling were 
undertaken they also do not include oil and gas offshore 
the minerals management service which is preparing new offshore 
estimates three years ago lowered its estimate of offshore oil 
from 27 billion barrels to 122 billion 
participants at the denver meeting also were advised that the 
survey now estimates that reserves of undiscovered natural gas at 
254 trillion cubic feet down from the previous estimate of 427 
trillion 
the potential gas committee an industry group operated by the 
colorado school of mines said last year that in 1986 about 400 
trillion cubic feet of gas remained to be discovered in the 
categories corresponding to the service estimates 
girard said the service was not counting at least 100 trillion 
cubic feet of gas in difficulttoproduce tight sands formations 
that the committee includes the service also does not count gas in 
certain shale formations that the committee counts 
neither body counts gas locked in coal seams which the 
committee termed enormous perhaps 400 trillion to 800 trillion 
cubic feet some of that gas is being produced commercially in 
alabama 
the committee has gradually lowered its estimates of 
undiscovered gas including probable reserves and reserves 
offshore from about 900 trillion cubic feet in 1980 and 1982 to 
765 trillion cubic feet in 1986 
industry reaction to the new estimates was mixed 
we are very upset said terry uhl of the american gas 
association people will not pay attention to the differing 
classifications and it amounts to misinformation and 
disinformation to say that undiscovered gas is only 254 trillion 
cubic feet uhl said 
charles dibona president of the american petroleum institute 
said he was unable to say what the numbers mean and the institute 
does not even keep track of such estimates you never known until 
you drill he said 
the figures issued in denver were preliminary girard said and 
the survey expects to issue detailed findings asking for public 
comment sometime next month

tibetans maintain 24 people were killed including 21 tibetans and 
three police

proposed legislation to ensure the federal 
government complies with its own environmental laws is 
unconstitutional unneeded and could undercut efforts to clean up 
such facilities as the hanford nuclear reservation reagan 
administration officials said thursday 
members of a house subcommittee insisted however that the 
department of energy and other agencies have thumbed their 
noses at efforts by the environmental protection agency to 
enforce federal environmental laws at federal facilities 
lawmakers also said that epa has been less than forceful in its 
efforts to force compliance with the laws while the department of 
justice has obstructed those efforts 
its a shame that some in the federal government have taken 
the position they are above the law said rep thomas luken 
dohio chairman of the transportation tourism and hazardous 
materials subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
the subcommittees hearing focused on five bills that were 
introduced late last year amid mounting criticism that the energy 
department and other federal agencies are dragging their feet over 
cleaning up federal facilities including the hanford reservation 
in central washington 
the general accounting office has said there may be over 1000 
hazardous waste sites at hanford the legacy of 40 years of 
plutonium production for nuclear weapons the waste is both highly 
radioactive and chemically toxic 
the scope and the complexity precludes quick solutions 
joseph salgado a doe undersecretary said of the cleanup at 
hanford and other facilities 
salgado said that a compliance agreement with epa and the state 
of washington covering cleanup of hanford was a top priority of 
doe 
but rep ron wyden dore said after the hearing that doe 
promised almost a year ago to come up with an agreement and a plan 
for hanford 
we still dont have a program a schedule or anything said 
wyden adding that a new justice department interpretation of some 
environmental laws might even preclude states from getting involved 
in enforcement efforts 
this is just another message that the administration isnt 
serious about hanford cleanup and is just throwing up more 
obstacles said wyden 
wyden and rep al swift dwash are among the sponsors of the 
package of bills that would establish a special environmental 
counsel to enforce the laws broaden the authority of the epa and 
the states in environmental matters at federal facilities and 
create a special doe department to handle environmental issues 
salgado said that the five proposed bills were unneeded and that 
his department acknowledged their responsibility to comply with 
federal environmental regulations 
the department of energys critical national security mission 
must not be jeopardized by an environmental protection and safety 
program too weak to assure excellence or by one so rigid and 
oppressive that these missions cannot be accomplished he said 
salgado said doe believes that the present framework of state 
and federal laws are adequate and appropriate

gallaudet university students declared 
thursday that elisabeth ann zinser the new president of the school 
for the deaf is unwelcome on the campus and vowed to keep her out 
although a congressman wants her to learn firsthand about the 
students concerns 
students have been protesting the selection of zinser who is 
not deaf and does not know sign language and their demonstrations 
have halted virtually all instruction for four days they have 
promised to continue their protests until she resigns 
they threatened to seize the presidents campus house and 
office if zinser made her way past students blocking entrances to 
the school 
zinsers whereabouts thursday could not be determined 
university officials would not reveal at which hotel she was 
staying 
student leader greg hlibok said students were willing to meet 
with zinser but intend to tell her and jane bassett spilman 
chairwoman of the schools board of trustees that there will be 
no dialogue no compromise thats what were promising 
we want her out and we intend to tell her she isnt welcome 
here that shes not our president hlibok added 
rep david bonior dmich who is a member of gallaudets board 
of trustees said in a statement thursday he suggested to zinser 
that in the next few days she consult with the faculty students 
staff and alumni to experience the passion with which they view 
the appointment of hearing president 
the time is long overdue for gallaudet university to have a 
deaf president bonior said the university has for generations 
been an international mecca for excellence and opportunity in deaf 
education 
the question before us is how long will it be able to 
sustain this important role without a deaf president 
i hope dr zinser and the board of trustees will be sensitive 
to this urgent need as they begin to try to heal the wounds and 
move forward to enhance the fine traditions of this institution 
earlier in an interview with the washington post bonior said 
he told zinser that federal aid for the school may be jeopardized 
if she refuses to leave the post she was named to sunday night 
about 75 percent of the schools 76 million operating budget 
comes from federal funds the rest comes from tuition and grants 
zinser who left an administrative position at the university of 
north carolina at greensboro to take the gallaudet job said 
wednesday she was assuming her post immediately instead of waiting 
until the original july starting date 
she also lamented that campus protests have disrupted classes 
and said she would take unspecified steps to restore order if the 
protests which have been peaceful so far took a violent turn 
besides calling for zinsers ouster the students want spilmans 
resignation and a deaf majority on the 20member trustees board 
which now has four deaf members 
as zinser attempted to start her job support for the protesters 
grew 
late wednesday democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson 
issued a statement supporting the students and called on 
gallaudets board of trustees to resolve this dispute equitably 
the problem is not that the students do not hear the problem 
is that the hearing world does not listen jackson said 
sen paul simon dill another democratic presidential 
hopeful on thursday called for zinsers resignation 
simon a longtime member of the senate labor and human resources 
subcommittee on the handicapped which has jurisdiction over 
funding for gallaudet said zinsers appointment was a slap in 
the face to the entire purpose of the university 
vince dollard a spokesman for the national technical institute 
for the deaf in rochester ny said two buses and several cars 
carrying at least 100 students from the school were to leave at 
midnight for washington to join the gallaudet protest 
a rally was being held on the rochester campus in support of 
gallaudet thursday afternoon 
in addition some east coast leaders of the national association 
of the deaf a 20000member deaf rights group based in silver 
spring md will gather in washington on friday spokesman fred 
weiner said 
and activist abbie hoffman who lectures to universities on 
student protests said whats happening at gallaudet is 
obviously right there in the front he said and theyre going 
to win their battle 
he said he has urged members of three electronic bulletinboard 
networks with a total of 16000 members to support the students 
efforts by tying up gallaudets switchboards with calls of support 
for the students

a long and often acrimonious battle 
between north carolina and tennessee over discharges from a 
champion international paper mill ended with approval of a 
compromise but environmentalists said their fight may not be over 
the mill in canton nc produces raw paper stock for milk and 
juice cartons and envelopes and discharges wastes into the pigeon 
river residents downstream in tennessee had complained for years 
that the wastes stained the pigeon dark brown killing game fish 
and reducing the potential for recreational revenues 
tennessee officials agreed wednesday to grant champion a 
variance on its water quality standards the compromise will allow 
the mill to continue operating by forcing it to cut its discharges 
significantly 
this has been hanging over our heads for about three years 
oliver blackwell manager of the mill 
we still have a lot of work to do he said noting that it 
could take months before a revised wastewater discharge permit can 
be issued by the epa this is a big step but we recognize we 
dont have the permit yet 
environmentalists pledged to keep an eye on the plant nelson 
ross one of the founders of the dead pigeon river council in 
tennessee called the agreement only an intermediate step toward 
cleaning up the river 
were going to construct picnic areas ramps for whitewater 
enthusiasts said ross were going to develop some parks along 
the shores of the pigeon river and heaven help champion if they 
dont follow through and clean up the river like theyve pledged to 
do 
in accepting this revised permit champion has agreed to 
operate under the most stringent environmental limits of any mill 
in north america and possibly the world said blackwell its 
going to be difficult but im encouraged 
the canton plant employs about 2300 people with an annual 
payroll of about 73 million an additional 8000 jobs depend on 
champions purchases and contracts 
the compromise drew praise from north carolina gov jim martin 
and tennessee gov ned mcwherter who have been directly involved 
in the negotiations 
this is the first agreement reached to clean up the pigeon 
river in the 80 years since the paper mill began operations said 
mcwherter it is a significant breakthrough in improving the 
rivers quality and allowing us to develop the areas economic 
potential 
the two states werent so complimentary in recent years 
in 1983 tennessee sued champion and the north carolina 
environmental management commission contending the discharge made 
the river unsuitable for fishing swimming boating or drinking 
when north carolina granted champion a new permit in 1985 to 
dump wastewater into the pigeon which begins south of canton and 
flows into cocke county tenn it placed no limit on the color of 
the discharge at tennessees urging the environmental protection 
agency canceled the permit and took juristiction 
the epas first proposed permit said the river could be no 
darker than 50 color units about the color of ginger ale when 
it reached the tennessee border about 60 miles north of the paper 
mill 
enviromentalists have said the color level in the river in cocke 
county ranged from 600 to 800 units 
the proposed fiveyear permit which must be approved by both 
states calls for a reduction in the color discharged from the mill 
by 50 percent with additional reductions when river levels are low 
the compromise calls for tennessee to grant champion a variance 
from the 50unit standard the revised permit allows about twice 
that 
champion already has applied for a variance from north carolina 
which must be approved before the wastewater permit is granted by 
the epa 
blackwell said the modernization of the plant and environmental 
control equipment to comply with the new standards within the 
required threeyear time frame would cost the company about 100 
million

vandals protesting alleged elitism at 
brown university damaged 10 oil portraits of early school 
supporters 
it appears to be a protest against the white elitist male 
orientation of the founders of the university eric broudy 
spokesman for the school said wednesday 
the vandals spraypainted the message elite who us across 
the paintings in the manning chapel broudy said 
a group calling itself the coalition for creative subversion 
claimed responsibility and called on the school to diversify 
itself broudy said 
the vandalism occurred feb 17 one day before a seminar on 
class and elitism was held in the room said eric widmer the dean 
of student life 
widmer said it will cost more than 15000 to restore the 
portraits which are more than a century old i dont know that a 
value could be placed on the paintings but theyre certainly part 
of the history of brown he said

around campus contended that incidents from browns history show 
that the school is racist sexist and biased against certain 
religions 
another way brown perpetuates these discourses is by choosing 
to hang paintings of wealthy white men on its walls the

the states highest court on thursday rejected 
claims of an unfair trial and left standing the convictions of four 
men in the 1983 gang rape of a woman on a tavern pool table 
in a pair of unanimous rulings the massachusetts supreme court 
rejected defense objections to the prosecutors handling of 
evidence to the trial judges decision to keep television cameras 
turned away from the victim and to other matters 
bristol county district attorney ronald pina welcomed the 
ruling saying he hoped it would end the lingering controversy over 
the case and encourage women everywhere to prosecute rapes 
defense attorney david h waxler said he was reviewing the 
opinion for possible grounds for further appeal 
the unfortunate aspect of this sort of decision is that future 
prosecutors rest more comfortbaly in the knowledge that they need 
not turn over exculpatory evidence and thats unfortunate he 
said its the old saying tough cases make bad law 
the dramatic account of the rape given by the victim a young 
mother and the lengthy televised trial in superior court in 1984 
drew unwanted national attention to the workingclass neighborhoods 
of new bedford and sparked an intense debate over rape it also 
brought agony to the portugueseamerican community in the fishing 
city 60 miles south of boston 
six young men of portugese descent were charged in the case 
four were convicted of aggravated rape 
daniel silvia was sentenced to nine to 12 years joseph vieira 
six to eight years and john cordeiro and victor raposo nine to 12 
years each 
the victim also of portuguese ancestry left new bedford and 
was killed in a singlecar crash outside miami in 1986 at age 25 
according to court records the woman entered big dans tavern 
on march 6 1983 to buy cigarettes she ordered a drink and spoke 
briefly with another woman and they watched a game of pool when 
she declined an offer of a ride from cordeiro and raposo the court 
said she was knocked down dragged to thje pool table and raped 
the judges said 
eventually clothed only in a shirt and one shoe the victim 
escaped and ran into the street where she flagged down a passing 
truck 
on appeal vieira and silvia claimed the prosecutor failed to 
make a timely disclosure of certain evidence that might have helped 
the defense depriving them of their rights to due process they 
also argued that the district attorney suppressed until after trial 
a witnesss recorded account of the victims condition and 
statements shortly after the rape 
and they argued that young prejudiced the defense theory that 
the victim consented to the sex they also complained about the 
exclusion of an allegedly false prior complaint of rape by the 
woman 
in their separate appeal cordeiro and raposo argued that 
youngs order keeping courtroom cameras away from the woman 
prejudiced their right to a fair trial they also claimed that 
young erred in refusing to instruct the jury on consensual rape 
the high court dismissed each claim

an angolan official said thursday his 
government would never agree to giving rebel leader jonas savimbi a 
role in running the country if an end to the civil war is 
successfully negotiated 
manuel pedro pacavira angolas new ambassador to the united 
nations indicated that savimbi would have to leave before there 
could be any reconciliation between officials of his marxist 
government and unita savimbis organization 
some elements of unita could deserve different treatment 
but not savimbi pacavira told reporters at a luncheon he is a 
crook incoherent doesnt care about consequences 
savimbis group the national union for the total independence 
of angola or unita receives financial aid from the united states 
and south africa 
before peace is achieved pacavira said south africa must cease 
its help to unita and there must be an understanding that the 
united states will end its assistance 
a major stumbling block to ending the 12year civil war is the 
presence of 40000 cuban troops in angola state department 
officials say the angolans have agreed in principle to withdrawal 
of the troops 
pacavira said angola is prepared to remove the troops within 
limits once outside aid to unita stops and south africa grants 
independence to namibia under a united nations plan 
the angolans have not provided a timetable for any troop 
withdrawal but pacavira said he expects another ministerial 
meeting between officials of luanda and washington in march or 
april 
assistant secretary of state chester crocker who has tried for 
seven years to negotiate a solution in angola held discussions 
with angolans in january the state department said it is awaiting 
new proposals from angola 
pacavira said the united states can continue to play a role as 
mediator but angola is also ready to hold discussions with 
officials of whiteruled south africa the cubans would have to be 
included in the talks he said 
pacavira dismissed a statement made by south african defense 
minister magnus malan who suggested that pretoria is willing to 
deal directly with the soviet union on angola 
his statement has nothing concrete and constructive 
pacavira said it is just an exercise to distract public 
opinion 
pacavira served as his countrys ambassador to cuba before being

george bush said thursday he is tired of being 
embarrassed by scandals surrounding public officials and 
unethical behavior by high government officials he pledged he 
would create a special white house ethics panel if elected 
president 
bush arriving in illinois on the heels of his stunning super 
tuesday victory also promised he would set up a budget deficit 
summit with congressional leaders on day one of his 
administration an echo of a stand taken by gop presidential rival 
bob dole 
bush told the governors club luncheon at the chicago hilton 
said that in such a summit scenario i am personally going to 
head the executive branch negotiating effort 
were going to meet were going to talk maybe even well 
shout but were going to solve this problem he said 
bush has said on several occasions that he would seek to bring 
people into government who want to serve not to profit but he 
has steadfastly refused to criticize any reagan administration 
officials including attorney general edwin meese who is under 
investigation by several grand juries 
former top white house aides michael k deaver and lyn nofziger 
have been convicted in court cases involving their lobbying 
activities after leaving the administration 
at a news conference shortly after his speech bush was asked 
whether his call for a special white house panel on ethics was a 
criticism of the way things had been done during the reagan 
administration 
no because i was asked this in an interview and i said i 
dont know of anybody who has a higher standard of personal ethics 
than the president always above any possible conflict of 
interest he replied certainly nobody should imply criticism 
im just saying what my priorities would be in the future 
asked to name public officials who had caused him embarrassment 
bush said im not going to be specific in terms of names im 
going to be generic 
bush said im just saying how i would do it 
he said in his speech i am personally disturbed at the 
breaches of ethics i have seen in the past few years in government 
once elected id appoint an ethics panel to work right there in 
the white house id have them draft a new and specific code of 
ethics 
when a congressman goes bad or someone in the executive branch 
violates the public trust it hurts he said im tired of 
being embarrassed im tired of seeing our children seeing things 
that should embarrass us all people at all levels of government 
should come to serve not to profit 
clearly i have big plans he told the audience of 
republican boosters who sat silently through the speech 
at the outset of his talk bush told his audience theres no 
complacency in his campaign in the wake of his near sweep of the 
super tuesday competition 
bushs announcement that he would personally oversee 
deficitreduction negotiations also seemed an implied criticism of 
reagan 
in the aftermath of the wall street crash last oct 19 reagan 
set up a negotiating team to work out a deficitreduction 
compromise with capitol hill leaders 
but with the exception of some meetings in the white house with 
congressional figures reagan left the actual bargaining to chief 
of staff howard baker treasury secretary james baker and budget 
director james miller 
those negotiations produced a twoyear 76 billion budget 
reduction plan which included 23 billion in new taxes 
bush from the start of the campaign has said that he would not 
try to win the gop nomination by jumping away from reagan or by 
criticizing the president 
im not going to try to move up the ladder by knocking someone 
else down the vice president has said 
and in thursdays speech there was plenty of praise for the 
president 
i am proud to have been part of a m ajor change in public 
policy he said they call it the reagan revolution because it 
was revolutionary you know the results greatest peacetime 
economic growth in our history strengthened defense the soviets 
come to the bargaining table 
but its not a complete triumph its only a beginning he 
said

the soviet union has bought an additional 
100000 metric tons of us corn for delivery this year under a 
longterm supply agreement between the two countries the 
agriculture department said thursday 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 100000 tons of 
corn would be about 394 million bushels 
corn prices recently have been averaging about 184 per bushel 
at the farm level meaning that the sale could have a farm value of 
around 725 million 
officials said the latest sale involved 50000 tons that had 
been reported by exporters as headed for japan and 50000 tons for 
unknown destinations 
the corn is part of the grain the soviet union is committed to 
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement which calls 
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of us grain 
the pact expires sept 30 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
with the latest purchases the soviets now have bought 327 
million tons of corn plus more than 9 million tons of wheat

president reagan would veto any bill requiring 
him to tell congress about all covert actions within 48 hours after 
they start defense secretary frank c carlucci said thursday 
carlucci who was national security adviser before being named 
to the defense post last november made the statement as a house 
intelligence subcommittee continued hearings on a bill overhauling 
the procedure for white house cooperation with capitol hill on 
intelligence matters 
administration officials had suggested previously that a 
presidential veto of such legislation was likely but carluccis 
statement marked the first time a top administration official had 
flatly promised a veto 
the house bill and a similar piece of legislation in the senate 
were a response to the irancontra affair in which us arms were 
secretly sold to iran and some of the profits diverted to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua final action on the senate bill is 
likely next week when the democraticcontrolled chamber returns 
from a oneweek vacation 
in the case of the irancontra affair reagan withheld 
notification from congress about the sale of arms to iran for 10 
months in 1986 but he has promised to tell congress about all 
future covert operations 
at some point we have to rely on trust carlucci told the 
subcommittee he noted that if a future president sets out to 
deceive a congress no amount of statutes will stop him 
carlucci said that either the senate or house bill surely 
will be vetoed by reagan 
current laws require that congress be notified of all covert 
operations except under extraordinary circumstances in those 
latter cases the law only requires timely notice but it does 
not define that phrase the pending bills would spell out that 
notice must be sent to capitol hill within 48 hours after a covert 
action starts 
reagan believes the bills are an unconstitutional limit on his 
authority carlucci said 
i can think of no step by the congress which would do more 
harm to the process of rebuilding an atmosphere of trust and candor 
between the branches than unilaterally to lay claim to prerogatives 
which the president firmly believes are vested in the executive by 
the constitution he said 
rep matt mchugh dny chairman of the intelligence 
subcommittee supported the bill and noted that in the case of 
the arms sales to iran the president construed current law as 
permitting him to withhold notice for more than 10 months after the 
covert sales had been authorized 
if he had done so as the law generally requires mchugh 
said he would surely have heard some strong objections and might 
have spared the country a serious foreign policy setback and 
himself a major political embarrassment 
but carlucci argued that the failures of the iran affair were 
human and managerial no statue can prevent these mistakes 
we will not put the mistrust which caused the irancontra 
affair behind us until we trust each other again carlucci said 
brent scowcroft national security adviser to president ford and 
a member of the tower commission that investigated the irancontra 
affair testified that the excessively restrictive language 
proposed seems a case of throwing out the baby with the bath it is 
not possible to eliminate every opportunity for abuse by the 
executive without at the same time paralyzing the ability to act 
he said the legislation arises from the belief that congress 
would have opposed the arms sales and derailed them if it had been 
notified 
but there is no evidence to support this assumption 
scowcroft said indeed as it was the president was confronted 
by his principal advisors with views strongly in opposition to the 
iranian arms sales

jack kemp ended his republican presidential 
campaign thursday saying george bush has won the reagan wing of 
the republican party and hinting that hed welcome the no 2 spot 
on the ticket 
kemp whose campaign as the true conservative heir to ronald 
reagan never caught on with voters endorsed no candidate he said 
of his rivals theyre all reagan conservatives 
the new york congressman bowed out at a capitol hill news 
conference flanked by his family and some of the house members who 
backed his candidacy he evoked cheers from moisteyed supporters 
with a vow that no way would this be his last campaign for the 
white house 
kemp 51 said he would not seek reelection to the house seat 
from buffalo that he has held for 18 years he did not rule out 
running for the senate from new york but said he had no plans to do 
so 
he called the notion that he might be asked to be the republican 
vice presidential candidate a very flattering and awesome 
thought 
he said he didnt expect it but added would i think about it 
the answer to that is yes 
kemp entered the presidential race in april 1987 after years of 
preparation to position himself as the candidate of the republican 
right wing 
but his campaign never caught on with republican voters and he 
consistently finished behind bush bob dole and former television 
evangelist pat robertson in the gop primaries 
less than three weeks ago in a debate with his rivals kemp 
declared that the nomination of bush or dole would signal the death 
of the reagan revolution of conservatism but in withdrawing 
kemp said that bush had won reagans republican constituency 
we were competing for the reagan wing of the republican party 
and he won kemp said 
its very clear that george bush ran on the reagan agenda and 
i think that the vote for george bush with all due respect today 
is a vote for ronald reagan kemp said 
its simply to recognize that i was running against ronald 
reagan and thats a surprise because i am his strongest proponent 
at least in terms of the ideals that were launched back in 1980 
kemp spoke by telephone with bush and the other gop candidates 
wednesday night bush chief of staff craig fuller with the vice 
president said bushs respect for the congressman has grown over 
the course of the campaign 
kemp never was able to coalesce around his candidacy even the 
conservative movement within the republican party that he claimed 
to lead 
some conservative leaders said that while they would like to see 
kemp on the ticket they doubted he had displayed enough political 
drawing power to be asked to join it 
robertson said with jack kemps withdrawal today i am more 
and more being urged by conservatives to stay in the race as a 
rallying point for conservatives and conservative principles 
portions of the 3 or 4 percent hes been getting should come 
over to me robertson said 
kemps best showing in the primaries was 13 percent of the vote 
in new hampshire on tuesday in 17 gop contests the best he scored 
was a dismal 7 percent in massachusetts 
kemp won just four delegates from 712 at stake in super tuesday 
contests kemp had 35 committed delegates but most of those were 
handed to him by bush in a michigan compromise designed to prevent 
robertson from claiming a victory 
daniel l casey executive director of the american conservative 
union said that with kemp gone from the race many conservative 
republicans could be expected to focus their efforts on trying to 
shape the republican party platform beyond that he said they may 
push for a conservative running mate and turn attention to 
congressional and other local races 
it remains to be seen whether or not the leadership in 
washington of the conservative movement will establish a working 
relationship with the bush campaign said casey 
campaign spokesman john buckley said kemp spent 15 million on 
his effort and departs with debts of less than 100000 
we balanced our budget kemp said

sen paul simon is counting on a strong 
showing in his home state of illinois next tuesday to restore his 
eligibility for federal matching funds before a cutoff is 
triggered a campaign spokesman said thursday 
simon became ineligible for matching funds by winning less than 
10 percent of the vote in two successive primaries but election 
law stays the cutoff for 30 days 
the matching funds can continue to flow during the 30 days and 
eligibility is restored when a candidate receives at least 20 
percent of the vote in another state primary 
we are not in jeopardy said simons press secretary terry 
michael there is zero chance that we wont get 20 percent next 
tuesday in fact he said simon is counting on cleaning up in 
all but three of the states 22 congressional districts 
michael conceded those three chicago districts to the states 
other native son jesse jackson who expects he will win much more 
than that 
federal election commission spokesman fred eiland said that 
after simon fell below the 10 percent threshhold in south dakota 
and vermont he would have had to get 20 percent in one of the 
super tuesday states this week 
since he did not campaign for super tuesday and failed to do 
achieive the threshhold his ineligibility for matching funds will 
be effective march 31 unless he does well in illinois eiland said 
rep jack kemp rnew york also has fallen below the threshhold 
but since he dropped out of the race on thursday he will be 
allowed to receive matching funds to pay off any leftover debts 
however he could not use those funds to resume campaigning 
the same is true of former colorado sen gary hart if he drops 
out of the race friday as aides have said he would do 
the matching funds are provided from the taxypayersupported 
fund every donation of 250 or less that a candidate raises is 
matched by the public fund to qualify a candidate must raise at 
least 100000 across 20 states in contributions of 250 or less 
michael said simon has whittled down his loan debt which stood 
at more than 500000 at the beginning of february to about 
45000 and has some 100000 in cash on hand 
the campaign raised 932000 during february through events and 
direct mail and got 364000 in matching funds 
simon has received a total 22 million in matching funds so far

one year has passed since four 
teenagers made a suicide pact and died together in a locked garage 
here but local officials say the worst thing they could do is 
commemorate the deaths 
all psychiatrists tell us dont memorialize it in any way 
said school superintendent john habeeb it could only cause 
trauma it will be business as usual on friday 
last march 11 thomas olton 19 thomas rizzo 18 and sisters 
cheryl and lisa burress ages 17 and 16 were found dead of carbon 
monoxide poisoning in oltons idling car 
reporters descended upon the school and officials worried that 
other troubled youths seeking glorification might try to imitate 
the four 
our fear was that the blitz could trigger some students that 
were already unstable habeeb said after all its very 
romantic to get your name in the paper 
charlotte p ross president and executive director of the youth 
suicide national center in washington dc said studies in the 
past year tend to discount any copycat theory of adolescent 
suicides 
theres an enormous amount of suicidal behavior among young 
people ms ross said since bergenfield studies have cast 
shadows and a lot of doubt that suicide is like the measles you 
cant catch it 
even so bergenfield has worked hard to avoid any repeat of the 
tragedy 
in the past year bergenfield high school has given a parttime 
drug and alcohol counselor fulltime status authorities found 
traces of cocaine in the blood of all four of the dead youngsters 
and two had been drinking 
the school also hired a psychiatrist for grades 712 and hired 
two outreach workers for its community response team the response 
team comprised of mental health professionals clergy teachers 
and police officers began immediately after the suicides 
its an example of an outstanding response ms ross said 
theyve worked very hard we dont know how many suicides came 
close and were prevented 
bergenfields strategy will be part of a manual on adolescent 
suicide due for release in the spring by the federal centers for 
disease control and will play a part in guidelines being assembled 
in california for municipalities there she said 
bergenfield has done such a good job that the federal government 
denied two grant applications for the community saying other 
municipalities needed the money more habeeb said 
he said the schools programs have cost about 80000 and new 
jersey has sent a 35000 state grant for substance abuse programs 
in town 
robert j gallione jr the recently elected mayor of this 
community of 26000 residents and a job counselor at columbia 
university says the money is well spent 
the focus of the past year has been on reaching out to youths 
and identifying teenagers who feel alienated special attention is 
paid to dropouts since three of the four suicide victims had left 
school 
habeeb said bergenfields low dropout rate of 15 percent can 
lead to dropouts being stigmatized 
gallione added that a mayors advisory committee on youth gives 
teenagers a chance to suggest ideas that might not naturally occur 
to adults 
one recent suggestion was a townsponsored battle of teen rock 
bands gallione called that a good approach to disaffected youths 
who often find a safe haven in music 
while school officials work on prevention others in town want 
to forget 
four 15yearold sophomore girls who didnt want to give a 
reporter their names said the suicides are not talked about much 
anymore 
the mayor said such an attitude is not a bad thing 
there was a lot of negative focus but its been offest by 
other things we do in the community gallione said people have 
to come to see another side of us just a traditional community

an increase in the federal minimum wage from 
335 to 505 an hour was tentatively approved thursday by the 
house education and labor committee 
the original bill before the committee called for an increase of 
50 cents in 1989 40 cents in 1990 and 40 cents in 1991 to 465 
the committee adopted on a vote of 1814 an amendment by rep 
carl c perkins dky which added a 40cent increase in the 
fourth year on dec 31 1991 
the full committee was unable to take action on all the pending 
amendments and will continue debate on the bill next week 
the senate has a companion bill sponsored by edward m kennedy 
dmass chairman of the labor and human resources committee which 
would raise the minimum wage to 465 over a threeyear period 
the perkins amendment was approved essentially along party lines 
except that two democrats reps austin j murphy of pennsylvania 
and timothy j penny of minnesota joined the republicans in 
opposing the proposal 
murphy is chairman of the house labor standards subcommittee 
which had approved an increase to 465 he said that legislation 
was crafted so that it will be accepted by the full house and the 
executive branch if we accept this perkins proposal it will not 
be accepted 
rep stephen j solarz dny read from a letter written by 
labor secretary ann mclaughlin who said senior white house 
advisers would recommend to president reagan that he veto any 
legislation increasing the minimum wage 
so it doesnt matter what we do the executive will be against 
it solarz said 
the house committee also voted 2013 on an amendment by rep 
tommy f robinson dark to increase the tip credit for 
restaurant workers 
current law allows employers of workers who regularly receive 
tips such as waiters and waitresses to count the tips as earned 
wages equivalent to 40 percent of the minimum wage thus a 
restaurant owner could pay a worker 201 an hour with the 
remaining 134 40 percent of todays 335anhour minimum wage 
coming from tips 
under the robinson amendment the tip minimum would be raised to 
50 percent of the minimum thus if the minimum wage were increased 
to 505 an hour an employer could pay a 252 hourly wage with 
the other 252 coming from tips 
the biggest argument of the session came over the amendment by 
perkins who said his proposal does not go far enough but it is a 
start 
it gives the american worker some level of decency perkins 
said

the soviet union said thursday it feels free to 
keep sending military aid to the kabul government even after it 
withdraws its troops from afghanistan 
it rejected a us demand that foreign military aid to both 
sides in the afghanistan war cease simultaneously once a peace 
settlement is reached the united states aids the afghan rebels 
nikolay kozyrev a senior soviet specialist in asian affairs 
said that except for sending new troops to afghanistan the soviet 
union was not committed to halt any kind of assistance to kabul he 
noted that the two countries had contractual ties now for seven 
decades 
kozyrev introduced as an ambassadoratlarge came to geneva as 
head of a small soviet delegation assigned to follow the indirect 
peace talks between pakistan and afghanistan un undersecretary 
general diego cordovez is mediating the talks 
kozyrevs appearance at a news conference organized by the 
soviet mission to the un office in geneva marked the first time a 
soviet official took a public stand on the negotiations since the 
talks started almost six years ago 
he said the question of a cutoff of soviet aid never was a 
subject of the unsponsored peace talks he termed the us 
demand for a symmetrical cessation of military aid spelled out 
at a state department briefing last friday an attempt to 
interfere with the internal affairs of afghanistan and with the 
bilateral relationship between kabul and moscow 
kozyrev said the us demand would be tantamount to moscow 
calling for a cutoff of us military aid to pakistan 
a us mission spokesman chris henze said there would be no 
immediate comment from robert peck the assistant deputy secretary 
of state who is in geneva to follow the talks kozyrev said he was 
in touch with peck 
the chief afghan negotiator foreign minister abdul wakil said 
last week draft documents of the settlement provided for us aid 
to the islamic guerrillas to cease simultaneously with the start of 
the withdrawal of the estimated 115000 soviet troops 
the united states is the main supplier of arms to the guerrillas 
fighting the marxist kabul government with shipments reported 
worth about 700 million last year and including shoulderfired 
stinger missiles 
kozyrev told reporters that after agreement was reached on all 
main elements of the projected peace package negotiations bogged 
down because of pakistans insistence on the settlements being 
accompanied by formation of a broadbased transitional government 
in kabul 
pakistan argues that only such a government replacing the 
sovietbacked one headed by president najib would be able to 
oversee implementation of the agreements and ensure a safe return 
of more than 5 million refugees from pakistan and iran 
kozyrev sidestepped a question on whether negotiations could 
continue after next tuesdays target date set by moscow soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev has said moscow will bring home its 
troops starting may 15 provided the settlement is signed by march 
15 
pakistan which adjoins afghanistan supports the guerrillas and 
acts as their spokesman at the geneva talks 
cordovez met separately with the two delegations thursday for a 
total of five hours he said there would be no formal negotiation 
session friday but he would meet privately with the two sides 
cordovez said earlier that final agreement was not imminent 
also on thursday the 43nation un human rights commission 
adopted by a 297 vote a westernsponsored resolution expressing 
concern at what it said were continued widespread violations of 
human rights by afghan authorities despite some improvement six 
nations abstained and mozambique was absent 
the soviet union intervened militarily in neighboring 
afghanistan in late 1979 and its troops stayed on to fight 
antimarxist guerrillas

nine years ago federal health officials set nine 
goals for reducing fatalities from injuries in the united states by 
1990 thursday officials predicted at least six of those goals 
will be met 
the fatality rates from many types of injuries such as car 
accidents house fires and drownings have dropped since 1979 
when the us department of health and human services announced its 
1990 goals the centers for disease control reported thursday 
but in some cases the rates have not fallen as far as the 
government had hoped the cdc said while authorities expect to 
meet the goals on reducing deaths from car crashes childhood 
household accidents house fires and gun accidents the goals for 
reducing deaths from falls and drownings wont be met 
achieving the 1990 objectives will require the coordinated 
efforts of federal state and local agencies academic 
institutions professional associations and private entities the 
atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report 
here from the cdc report are the nations 1990 goals for 
reducing deaths from injuries and the progress being made 
reducing the nations annual motor vehicle fatality rate from 
236 such deaths per 100000 americans in 1978 to 18 per 100000 in 
1990 by 1984 the rate had fallen to 196 and the goal is 
projected to be met in part because of a reduction in 
alcoholrelated fatalities 
reducing the motor vehicle fatality rate for children under 
15 from 9 per 100000 in 1978 to 55 by 1984 the rate had fallen 
to 66 and the goal is projected to be met 
reducing the death rate from falls from 62 per 100000 in 
1978 to 20 the rate had fallen only to 51 by 1984 and the goal 
is not expected to be reached people over 65 continue to have high 
death rates from falls for example in 1984 102 such deaths per 
100000 people age 6574 and 147 per 100000 people over 84 
reducing the death rate for children under 15 in home injuries 
from 6 per 100000 in 1978 to 5 the 1984 rate was 49 already 
meeting the objective 
reducing the drowning rate from 32 per 100000 in 1978 to 
15 the rate had fallen only to 23 in 84 and the goal is not 
expected to be met 
reducing the number of deaths in residential fires from 5401 
in 1978 to 4500 the objective was reached in 1984 when 4466 
americans died in such fires 
reducing the number of deaths in firearm accidents from 1806 
in 1978 to 1700 the goal was met in 1984 when 1668 such deaths 
were reported 
reducing the suicide rate among 1524yearolds from 121 per 
100000 in 1978 to 11 the rate is going up not down it was 122 
per 100000 in 1984 up slightly from 1978 and up about 200 percent 
from 1950 the cdc noted that various suicide prevention approaches 
have been tried in communities but the effectiveness is not known 
reducing the homicide rate among black males aged 1524 from 
707 per 100000 in 1978 to 60 this goal will probably be met 
according to cdc researcher dr richard sattin the rate had fallen 
in 1984 to 615 this goal was set recognizing the high homicide 
rate among young black men sattin said noting that the national 
homicide rate in 1984 was 84 per 100000 americans

jesse jackson is the favorite son and 
frontrunner in south carolinas democratic caucuses saturday 
leaving the division of the remaining delegates among the other 
presidential candidates as the only question mark 
jackson was born and raised in south carolina one of two states 
he won in his 1984 presidential race 
jackson who plans a homecoming campaign trip friday has the 
overwhelming support of the states black voters who make up more 
than onethird of the electorate and got an average of 10 percent 
of the white vote in other southern states on super tuesday 
between a quarter and a half of south carolina democrats 
traditionally remain uncommitted at the caucus meetings to give 
themselves more maneuvering room through the nominating process 
they usually choose a candidate at the county or state convention 
that leaves few delegates for the rest of the field but in a 
tight national race in which no candidate appears to be able to 
capture the majority of delegates every one helps 
this certainly increases the importance of south carolina 
because the delegate count is so close said kevin gray state 
coordinator for jackson 
the candidates are relying on grassroots organizing telephone 
banks and direct mail to lure democrats to the caucus none is 
buying television advertisements 
tennessee sen albert gore jr who plans to campaign in the 
state on friday has the largest organization in the state and the 
most endorsements from elected officials who wield strong 
influence at the caucuses 
gore also has the momentum from his strong showing across the 
south tuesday which lessened the perception among some south 
carolinians that hes not electable 
missouri rep richard gephardt who traveled across the state 
wednesday and thursday has a skeletal organization but his few 
endorsements are the biggest former govs dick riley and robert 
mcnair and all of the south carolina democratic congressmen who 
have chosen sides 
dukakis has an even smaller local organization 
all of the competing state campaigns except gores has conceded 
that jackson will win the lions share of the 44 delegates at stake 
i dont think there is any doubt that jesse jackson will 
win said bill prince gephardts state coordinator 
house speaker robert sheheen gores state chairman said 
theres really no way of knowing whether the tennessee senator 
can upset jackson were not conceding anything to anybody 
gore who is the only candidate with an outside chance of 
upsetting jackson is promoting his strong ties to the south and a 
strong defense which plays will in the palmetto state 
gephardt is hoping to use his trade policy to gain votes in the 
state which has seen its largest industry textiles severely 
weakened by cheap foreign imports 
but most political scientists and campaign officials agree that 
because the democratic field is so large and so close together and 
because a large number of delegates probably will remain 
uncommitted the results saturday will be inconclusive 
take rileys assessment thursday for example jackson will do 
very well gore is well organized dukakis will get a piece of the 
vote and gephardt will get his share 
south carolinas democratic leaders decided against following 
the crowd on super tuesday when all of the other southern states 
held primaries 
they decided to nestle in the days of old clemson 
university political science professor steve wainscott said 
thursday

residents of this sprawling military 
base and neighboring towns mourned again thursday for victims of an 
army aviation accident this time 17 soldiers killed in a 
helicopter collision 
the members of the elite 101st airborne division died tuesday 
when helicopters on separate night training missions slammed into 
each other 
the crash was the worst in fort campbell history and the worst 
army aviation accident since 248 fort campbell soldiers died dec 
12 1985 when a chartered jet bringing them home for christmas 
from a mideast peacekeeping mission crashed in canada 
i think any soldier will tell you that when you fly as many 
hours as they do and perform the exercises they do you can expect 
things to happen said charlie c gentry a motel owner in 
clarksville tenn the closest town to fort campbell 
even so he said to me its kind of like hearing about maybe 
a real close friend i had in high school and hadnt seen for a 
while getting killed in a car wreck so even though i didnt know 
them theres more of a feeling of loss than with other news 
stories 
army crash investigators listened to air traffic control tapes 
and interviewed witnesses in an effort to learn the cause of the 
accident spokesmen said specifics would not be released until a 
full report was made probably within 90 days but said some 
details emerged from talks with air controllers and witnesses 
one of the helicopters was leading a formation of three uh60 
black hawks headed east at an altitude of about 250 feet toward the 
airfield investigators said the lead aircraft was struck 
broadside by another black hawk that was flying alone about six 
miles from the airfield the remaining two aircraft were not 
damaged and landed safely 
the formation of three helicopters was returning infantry troops 
from a livefire exercise said fort campbell spokesman maj randy 
j schoel aircraft flying over the reservation under visual flight 
rules as the four copters were are not generally tracked by 
control tower radar and are responsible for avoiding each other 
schoel said 
the pilots were wearing night vision goggles that amplify 
available light and were supposed to have been in radio contact 
with the forts control tower the army spokesman said 
generally the helicopters running lights are dimmed to the 
point where they are not visible to the naked eye but they are 
obvious to someone wearing goggles schoel said 
he added fort campbell flies every night with night vision 
goggles its as routine here as driving at night in your car 
gentry manager of the winners circle motel about 200 yards 
from the forts main gate lowered the motels american flag to 
halfstaff 
further down the commercial strip at the snow white pawn shop 
owner morrell v boyd noted some of the signs businesses were 
putting up one at an army surplus store read our prayers are 
with you fort campbell 
people are putting up signs on the marquees but it goes 
deeper than that said boyd 51 its sort of a helpless 
feeling too youre not sure what to do 
a welcome center for the families of victims was being prepared 
on the post and memorial services were scheduled for next wednesday 
at the forts chapel 
gentry said the mourning among those in the community would be 
tempered by an appreciation of the risks the servicemen undertake 
regularly 
theres a lot of loss but a lot of pride too gentry said 
i feel a lot of pride in those guys

applicants started phoning a few hours after 
china announced it would accept the peace corps for the first time 
and the agency said thursday it is eager for negotiations with the 
chinese to set the terms of the program 
though the concentration is likely to be on english teachers 
china still must decide what special skills it wants the volunteers 
to have where they will serve and how large the peace corps 
program would be 
the agency also will have to put volunteers for the program 
through a rigorous testing program that rejects four out of five 
applicants said arlen erdahl director of recruiting for the peace 
corps 
well be just as careful as we always are erdahl told a 
news conference 
the united states in a drive for better relations with china 
had been giving chinese officials information about peace corps 
programs for years and began discussions of the issue in 1984 
on wednesday foreign minister wu xueqian announced during an 
appearance at the national press club that china had agreed to 
accept volunteers and would work out the details with us 
officials 
a few hours later karl and katherine brandt of lexington sc 
heard a radio news report about it and phoned the regional peace 
corps office in atlanta to volunteer 
weve always wanted to do something like this we visited some 
peace corps people in grenada once and when we heard about china we 
decided this might be a neat idea brandt said in a telephone 
interview 
the 55yearold chemist said he and his wife a nurse have 
never lived outside the united states but wed be interested in 
going to china 
the peace corps has been sending american teachers technicians 
professionals and community workers to foreign cities and villages 
since 1961 when president kennedy started the agency to improve 
americas overseas image 
the biggest country to accept volunteers had been india which 
had peace corps programs between 1962 and 1976 but china is the 
most populated country and erdahl said americas fascination 
with that nation is likely to spur applications for the corps 
he noted however that while applicants for the peace corps are 
asked to state their preferred assignments they are not guaranteed 
being sent to a specific country 
there are currently 64 countries with peace corps programs the 
process of establishing the agencys relationship with china will 
be the same as it was for the others it could take between two 
months and two years 
this is just the starting gong said john scales the 
agencys general counsel 
after a series of meetings china will make a formal request for 
a peace corps presence a team of agency officials will visit the 
country and the two sides will hammer out an agreement on numbers 
of volunteers where they will do their work and what they will do 
erdahl and several other peace corps officials who appeared at 
the news conference suggested that they expected china to be most 
interested in peace corps english teachers the agency has become a 
specialist in teaching english as a second language and runs such 
programs in 33 countries

a special program to store grain in river 
barges in the fall of 1986 to make way for the new harvest cost 
taxpayers nearly a dollar a bushel to operate for four months 
according to the general accounting office 
overall the 62 million cost was sharply higher than the 
storage fees normally paid by the government for grain inventories 
in elevators and farm bins the program was announced in august 
1986 as one of a number of emergency measures to help relieve 
pressure on elevators getting ready for another bumper corn harvest 
the gao an investigative agency of congress said in a recent 
report to rep bill alexander dark that the agriculture 
department awarded storage contracts to a dozen grain companies a 
total of about 649 million bushels of grain 98 percent corn and 
2 percent soybeans was loaded on 1253 barges along the illinois 
mississippi missouri and ohio rivers 
all of the barge grain originated from the corn belt states of 
illinois indiana iowa michigan minnesota missouri nebraska 
ohio and wisconsin the gao said most had been in country and 
terminal elevators in those states but some had been stored by 
producers on their farms 
eventually the departments kansas city commodity office which 
handled the program disposed of most of the barge grain by trading 
it to the contractors for grain they had stored in inland 
elevators the remainder was sold redeemed by farmers or returned 
to storage elsewhere 
we estimate that the additional cost of the special barge 
storage program over and above the normal costs for shipping 
storing and disposing of the grain was about 448 million or an 
additional cost of 69 cents per bushel to store the grain for an 
average of four months the gao said 
the estimate by gao was made because the departments 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service did not 
separately accumulate total cost data for the program however 
gao said its estimates were based on reviews of contracts and other 
information provided by the agency 
the estimated cost of storing the 649 million bushels of 
grain was about 622 million or 96 cents per bushel the gao 
said this includes the additional cost of the program about 
448 million and the cost that would have been incurred in the 
normal course of storage more than 173 million 
corn market prices nationally averaged 173 per bushel when the 
program was announced and dropped to 140 in october 1986 the 
peak of the new harvest 
investigators said they estimated the departments kansas city 
commodity office paid the 12 contractors about 455 million and 
that an additional 167 million went to others for charges related 
to the bargestored grain 
the gao said the kansas city office agreed with our 
methodology and results in estimating the payments

a judge who suggested during his 
reelection campaign that his opponent should stay home with her 
young children has been turned out of office in a landslide 
state district judge john mckellips exwife and six children 
had endorsed his opponent assistant county attorney mary anne 
bramblett in tuesdays democratic primary 
ms bramblett outpolled mckellips 32412 to 10752 and she is 
assured of taking office because there is no republican on the 
november ballot 
ms bramblett a political newcomer attributed her victory to a 
negative image that may have started with mckellips bitter divorce 
in 1985 lillian mckellips sued for divorce claiming mckellips was 
having an affair with his 1984 campaign manager margaret randle 
mckellips married ms randle two months after the divorce was 
granted he gained publicity again last summer when police were 
summoned to the courthouse to quell a quarrel between him and his 
new wife 
last month lillian mckellips and the couples six children 
endorsed ms bramblett citing mckellips treatment of them a 
couple of weeks later in an address at a sheriffs deputies 
meeting mckellips questioned ms brambletts qualifications 
partly because she is a mother 
she had to take some time out for maternity leave to have two 
small children so i dont know how much time shes actually spent 
working as an attorney he told the deputies 
while attacking his opponent for taking time off to care for her 
newborns mckellips criticized working mothers by linking absent 
mothers to overcrowded prisons 
the next day the judge amended his comments saying it would 
have been more correct to have used the term parent rather than 
mother 
ms bramblett whose children are 3 and 4 years old said at the 
time everybody got the clear message that mckellips believes i 
am not qualified to be a judge because im a woman and a mother 
county judge luther jones who recruited ms bramblett to run 
said the victory was truly an epochal event in el pasos legal 
history the image of both the attorneys and the entire judiciary 
have suffered immeasurable harm during the mckellips tenure on the

a shortage of track inspectors has contributed 
to worn railroad switches in csx transportation cos 
baltimorepittsburgh division a federal agency said thursday in an 
audit prompted by a series of freight train accidents 
the federal railroad administration which is part of the 
transportation department said that track along main routes is 
generally in top condition in the division which includes the 
district of columbia and parts of maryland pennsylvania virginia 
west virginia and new york 
but the audit also found that the training equipping and 
numerical strength of the maintenance of way forces in this 
division are inadequate a factor which threatens the companys 
capacity to maintain the quality of its track over the long term 
maintenance of way employees inspect track because manpower 
levels are low the audit said the districts assigned each csx 
track inspector are too large to be covered by a single individual 
inspectors compensate by focusing their efforts on main line track 
which is almost uniformly in excellent condition 
but the tradeoff lies in cursory inspections of turnouts 
or switches that allow a train to move from one track to another 
the audit said the declining condition of these turnouts have 
been a major problem on the line 
worn turnouts or improperly performed track maintenance were 
factors in several of the csx derailments occurring in 1987 the 
audit said 
it said turnouts throughout the division were replete with 
loose adjustable rail braces missing cotter pins and other 
problems the entire gamut of defective turnout conditions 
addressed by fra track standards could be found in one form or 
another in the division it said 
csx in a statement issued from its rail transport group in 
jacksonville fla said it already had begun a retraining program 
taught in part by railroad administration instructors for track 
inspectors foremen road masters and others working on the tracks 
in addition it said it had reached an agreement in the last few 
months with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees to 
increase the number of people involved in track inspection it 
did not specify how many would be added 
the statement noted that the audit had found a wellmaintained 
signal system and had expressed no overriding concerns about 
the transportation of hazardous materials 
the audit also said the railroad administration detected an 
apparent engineering problem in several sections of csx track 
near confluence pa it added that csx already has begun to 
reconstruct or move switches in the area 
last may a csx chemical tanker train derailed in confluence 
splintering a control tower and killing its operator and forcing 
nearby residents to evacuate it was the third derailment in the 
southwest pennsylvania community in five months 
csx trains also were involved in two derailments last year in 
the washington area in june 21 cars from a 134car train 
derailed temporarily halting subway service from suburban silver 
spring md and takoma park md in september 14 cars on a csx 
train derailed in northeast washington damaging 500 feet of metro 
subway track an electrical power station and a warehouse

a move by the agriculture department to crack 
down on illegally high traces of a suspected cancercausing drug 
found in hog carcasses has eased concern in japan that pork imports 
from the united states may be tainted officials said thursday 
japan had initiated a program to hold and test all us pork 
imports which american livestock interests feared might jeopardize 
foreign sales the drug involved is sulfamethazine commonly used 
by swine producers to prevent certain kinds of disease and as a 
feed additive to promote faster growth 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said usda and japanese officials 
have agreed on testing requirements for pork shipped to japan 
crawford said japanese officials have been favorably impressed 
with us efforts initiated on march 7 to increase testing of 
pork products for sulfamethazine residues in the 100 largest us 
pork plants 
us pork produced after march 7 must carry a statement on the 
export certificate that the product originated from one of the 100 
plants undergoing increased residue testing he said japan 
will not further test these products for sulfamethazine residues 
pork exported before the new controls went into effect will be 
tested further for the drug either in japan or the united states 
he said 
i am very pleased with this agreement crawford said 
along with our increased testing it ensures the safety of us 
pork products and reaffirms the integrity of the us pork 
industry

former secretary of state henry a kissinger 
said thursday that israel should hold early elections in order to 
resolve an intolerable political problem 
in a television interview taped for broadcast this weekend on 
the syndicated one on one interview program kissinger also 
reiterated his position that israel should give jordan the occupied 
gaza strip and densely populated parts of the west bank 
gaza was under egyptian control before israel captured it in the 
1967 mideast war but kissinger said it should now be given to 
jordan he did not explain 
kissinger said israel and the united states should stay away 
from an international peace conference proposed by secretary of 
state george p shultz 
i think there should be elections in israel its desirable 
you have a prime minister and a foreign minister who are cutting 
each other up he said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the rightwing 
likud bloc and foreign minister shimon peres who leads the labor 
party have both considered moving the elections up from november 
each side is trying to line up the united states and other 
foreign countries in their support its an intolerable situation 
so the earlier they have an election and get unified the more 
important it is kissinger said 
kissinger who mediated israeli agreements with the arabs in the 
mid1970s said he would prefer that the united states help 
negotiate peace between the sides without interference from the 
other four permanent members of the un security council the 
soviet union china england and france 
id prefer shultz to do it alone he said 
all the other countries will press for israeli withdrawal to its 
1967 borders he said i think those will guarantee the 
destruction of israel kissinger said 
he said a formula must be found under which israel would give 
back some of those territories but retain sufficient lands to 
guarantee it a defensible buffer zone

a former black panther convicted of 
murdering two guards in a bloody 1971 san quentin escape attempt 
walked out of prison on bail thursday almost two years after a 
judge ordered that he get a new trial 
i feel great im just very happy johnny spain told 
reporters at the front gate of the state prison at vacaville 50 
miles east of san francisco 
i wont let anyone down who has supported me and there have 
been many who supported me he said adding he was prepared to 
deal with the challenges of living on the outside after 21 years 
behind bars 
spain was hugged and congratulated by attorneys and 
investigators who worked on his case and members of their families 
attorney dennis riordan said spain had promised to attend a play 
in san francisco on thursday night with the 10yearold daughter of 
one of his supporters riordan said spain would remain in the san 
francisco area until at least wednesday for court appearances then 
planned to visit los angeles to see his wife and children 
some 100000 of spains bail has been posted but 250000 in 
property must be guaranteed by wednesday riordan said adding that 
he anticipated no problems 
us district judge thelton henderson who had previously 
granted spain a new trial in the san quentin six case a state 
lawyers request wednesday to delay bail until the state parole 
board reconsiders his case 
spain 38 has been behind bars since december 1966 when he was 
arrested for a murder and robbery in los angeles 
he later became the only prisoner convicted of murder in a 1971 
uprising in which george jackson widely known for his book of 
prison writings soledad brother was killed along with two 
other prisoners and three guards 
authorities said spain seen running from a maximumsecurity 
unit with jackson conspired with him in an escape attempt that led 
to the killings 
henderson reversed spains convictions in 1986 saying he had 
been denied a fair trial by being required to wear heavy shackles 
for every court appearance during the five years of proceedings 
the states appeal of the ruling is to be argued monday before 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
on tuesday los angeles superior court judge kathleen parker 
ordered spain paroled immediately from the sentence he has been 
serving for the 1966 murder a sentence that had kept henderson 
from granting bail earlier 
she found that the parole board had improperly lengthened his 
sentence nearly six years by applying regulations passed in 1976 to 
disciplinary violations committed in 1970 and 1971 
riordan said spain had spent twice as long in prison as the 
average sentence for a similar crime 
lawyers said spain would be living in san francisco and working 
as an electrician while his case is on appeal hendersons order 
allows him to travel within the state and visit his wife whom he 
married while in prison and two young sons in los angeles

iran has begun constructing crude launch pads 
for silkworm missiles on the island of abu musa in the persian 
gulf potentially expanding the area within which it can menace 
shipping us military sources said thursday 
the defense officials who agreed to discuss the matter only if 
not identified stressed that american intelligence agencies so far 
had failed to detect any effort by iran to actually send silkworm 
missiles over to the small island 
iran has built similar launch pads at other sites on its main 
coastline without ever deploying any actual missiles one source 
noted 
but its still significant because it would really extend the 
coverage of these missiles if they deployed silkworms there 
another official said 
the silkworm is a chinesebuilt variant of an old russian 
missile that can be fired from mobile launchers on land against 
ships the missiles have a range of about 50 miles and while not 
particularly accurate they carry a large warhead packed with 
conventional explosives 
according to us sources iran has acquired more than 100 
silkworms and stored the majority of them at a large naval base at 
bandar abbas near the strait of hormuz the sole entrance to the 
persian gulf 
although concrete launch pads arent essential for the silkworm 
truck launchers to operate the iranians nonetheless have 
constructed such pads at several sites along the coastline 
overlooking the strait as a result american warships escorting 
tankers in and out of the gulf normally go to battle stations for 
the passage and navy jets provide air cover just in case a missile 
attack is mounted 
abu musa is a small iraniancontrolled island inside the strait 
of hormuz roughly 50 miles into the gulf and almost in the middle 
of the waterway it long has been used by iran as a base for 
gunboats that have attacked commercial shipping 
if iran were to deploy silkworms on abu musa it would be 
doubling the arc of space that it can threaten one source said 
thursday 
it definitely would extend our area of vulnerability up into 
the gulf another official agreed 
wed have to get pretty serious about watching that 
island added a third source 
all the officials stressed that construction on the island had 
begun only recently and was proceeding slowly 
but it is assessed to be silkworm firing platforms said one 
the united states has been escorting reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
in the gulf since last july kuwait a key ally of iraq in the 
iraniraq war requested the protection after iran began singling 
out its ships for attack 
the 16th convoy operation of 1988 and the 38th overall began 
tuesday night and was said to be proceeding uneventfully on 
thursday with two tankers steaming southbound from kuwait toward 
the strait of hormuz along with a navy frigate

rep larry smith on thursday introduced 
resolutions that would deny foreign aid and trade privileges to 
mexico the bahamas peru bolivia and paraguay for alleged failure 
to cooperate with us antidrug efforts 
smith chairman of the house foreign affairs committees task 
force on international narcotics control said the five countries 
were wrongly certified by president reagan on march 1 as 
cooperating with drug enforcement programs 
some of these cooperative countries have even actively 
frustrated our efforts to stop the production of drugs and their 
trafficking into the united states smith dfla told 
reporters its time the president stands up and does more than 
just saying no 
smith and reps benjamin gilman rny and dante fascell 
dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs committee said the 
purpose of the resolutions was not necessarily to cut off aid to 
the five countries but to focus public attention on the 
certification process and determine whether it can be improved 
under comprehensive antidrug legislation enacted in 1986 the 
president must certify annually that major drugproducing and 
shipment countries have fully cooperated with the united 
states or they face loss of a years worth of military and 
economic development aid and us support for international 
development bank loans 
countries that are decertified also may suffer a wide range 
of trade sanctions at the presidents discretion these include a 
50 percent boost in import tariffs abrogation of airline 
agreements loss of us sugar quotas and a halt in preferred us 
customs treatment 
reagan recently certified all the 24 major drug countries as 
fully cooperating with us antidrug efforts except for panama 
afghanistan syria and iran which were decertified and for 
lebanon laos and paraguay which were certified for national 
interests 
under the law congress has 45 business days until may 13 to 
overrule any of reagans recent aid certifications and 30 days 
until april 19 to disapprove of further trade privileges for any 
countries the president certified as fully cooperating 
smith said mexico should be penalized because it is the primary 
source of heroin and marijuana entering the united states and the 
smuggling route for onethird of the cocaine destined for us 
consumption 
he said opium production has increased at least 30 percent and 
eradication has fallen by onethird since 1984 smith said 
laundering of illicit drug profits is extensive and that mexico 
provides safe haven for hundreds of drug traffickers indicted in 
the united states 
smith criticized drug enforcement efforts by the other four 
countries especially the bahamas which he said is the major 
transit point for half the cocaine and marijuana entering the 
united states 
at a hearing that smith headed thursday assistant secretary of 
state elliott abrams said that while we believe that mexico is 
capable of even greater effort against narcotics trafficking we 
also believe that mexican cooperation is substantial and 
justifies the presidents decision to certify mexico

would be no strike for one year the average petroleum worker earns 
350 a month compared to 100 a month for other government 
employees 
saul soliz leader of the union said the nostrike condition 
was a government maneuver designed to divide the labor movement

increase by firing 1500 workers 
the government conceded that there would be some dismissals to 
finance the pay increase but said they would not exceed 500

increasing competition within the citys 
drug trade prompted a suspected dealer to lead police to a rivals 
secret stash of heroin authorities said thursday 
no arrests were made but 443 small bags of heroin were 
confiscated wednesday police said the bags were worth 20 each 
for a total street value of 9000 said detective william 
gallagher 
the tipster cooperated with police because of growing 
competition among dealers in the north camden neighborhood the 
worst drug area in the city gallagher said 
we couldnt lock him up even though we know this guy is a drug 
dealer because he didnt have any on him we got the stash said 
thank you very much and he split gallagher said 
the owner of the drugs was not at the scene when officers 
william durham and michael comuso uncovered the stash 10 feet under 
a loose brick in the archway of a vacant house gallagher said 
durham and comuso had looked for the drugs for about a week 
combing through piles of trash and vacant and abandoned houses 
which gallagher described as the favored hiding places for drugs 
the tipster decided to help the officers after his rival began 
cutting into his territory gallagher said 
theres some conflict of interest up there he said adding 
that drug dealers from colombia and the dominican republic are 
trying to take over a neighborhood where black and other hispanic 
dealers have traditionally worked 
north camden is the hot spot right now the traffic just flows 
through there especially on thursday and friday after payday he 
said 
he declined to release the name of the tipster saying such 
action might make the man a target for retaliation from his rivals 
in a way the new spirit of cooperation is an asset for law 
enforcement officials who spend hours each day patrolling the 
blighted area he said 
but i also foresee where somebodys going to get hurt up 
there he said theyll shoot you in a heartbeat

the rev jerry falwell on thursday likened 
the tv evangelism scandals with the watergate affair and said the 
cause of christ is better off because of them 
the crisis that ended the nixon administration made it much 
tougher for politicians since then falwell told the national 
association of evangelicals 
in the days ahead it is going to be tougher for national 
ministry leaders to misbehave he said not impossible but 
tougher 
falwell a fundamentalist preacher who is not a member of the 
association appeared for the first time before the group which 
has 50000 members and represents 72 denominations 
an admission of sin last month by tv preacher jimmy swaggart and 
allegations last year of sexual and financial misconduct by jim 
bakker have led to a new code of moral and financial ethics for 
religious broadcasters fallwell said 
i think the days of the rollsroyces and rolexes the days 
in which social status is gauged by financial trappings are 
over falwell said at a luncheon sponsored by the national 
religious broadcasters an affiliate of the nae 
falwell said that the swaggart controversy had had little effect 
on his own ministry and that he did not believe it had equaled the 
general impact of the bakker revelations on the religious broadcast 
industry 
it seems that all the fallout that was going to occur 
occurred last year he said at a news conference after the 
luncheon 
however he said that if similar scandals had occurred to him or 
other more conservative ministers we would be out looking for 
other employment 
id rather be dead than be immoral he said 
bakker who admitted a tryst with a church secretary and who has 
been accused of financial improprieties was expelled from the 
assemblies of god church 
swaggart who has been accused of paying a prostitute to perform 
lewd acts was suspended by the denomination and expects to return 
to the pulpit 
after bakker resigned as head of ptl falwell headed the 
ministry for several months before stepping aside 
falwell accepted an invitation to speak before the nae in 1983 
but withdrew after criticism from fellow fundamentalists the 
fundamentalist side of protestant christianity maintains a 
theological separation from the more broadly based evangelical 
organization 
falwells old time gospel hour is broadcast around the world 
on some 350 television stations he is founder of the moral 
majority movement and pastor of the 21000member thomas road 
baptist church in lynchburg va the largest in the country 
turning to politics falwell praised former religious 
broadcaster pat robertson but said he endorsed george bush for the 
presidency even though falwell had ronald reagan not to choose 
bush as his vice president 
id love to see a bushkemp ticket he said referring to new 
york congressman jack kemp 
on the other side falwell said i cant think of a single 
democrat running this year who i could hold my nose and vote for 
in a presidential preference poll conducted late wednesday some 
100 nae board members endorsed bush followed by kansas sen robert 
dole kemp and robertson among democrats they favored rep 
richard gephardt of missouri 
the lastplace finish for robertson confounded conventional 
wisdom that he would be the nearunanimous choice of evangelical 
leaders said richard cizik research director for the nae in 
washington 
but it was no surprise to those trying to gauge the support for 
robertson within the evangelical movement over the past two years 
in two previous polls its leaders also placed robertson fourth 
among the gop candidates 
they just dont consider robertson to be the most qualified 
for the job cizik said 
among democrats gephardt was slightly favored over sen albert 
gore of tennessee with massachusetts gov michael dukakis sen 
paul simon of illinois and jackson a baptist minister trailing in 
that order 
bush received 40 percent of the votes on the gop side dole got 
32 percent kemp 17 percent and robertson 12 percent 
gephardt was ranked first among democrats by 37 percent of the 
board members gore received 33 percent dukakis 16 percent simon 
11 percent and jackson 5 percent 
in two previous two polls in march and october last year dole 
was the winner with more than 40 percent of the votes followed by 
kemp bush and robertson 
although evangelicals are considered conservative and orthodox 
in their religious views they represent a broad spectrum of 
political ideology and the board members are not necessarily a 
reflection of the rank and file said cizik 
the nae conducting a series of workshops and seminars for some 
500 delegates includes denominations as diverse as reformed and 
pentecostal among its members are baptists lutherans 
presbyterians and mennonites

ash and sludge produced by gas scrubbers that 
remove sulfur dioxide at coalfired plants generally does not need 
to be regulated as hazardous waste the environmental protection 
agency said thursday 
however small quantities of waste produced in cleaning boilers 
and purifying water do meet the definitions of hazardous wastes and 
the agency said it will consider whether to bring them under 
hazardous waste regulation 
the conclusions were contained in a report to congress on power 
plant wastes required by 1980 amendments to the federal hazardous 
waste law those amendments exempted such waste from regulation 
until completion of the study epa now has until september to 
decide what wastes if any to regulate as hazardous 
the agency said it would defer studying wastes from oilfired 
plants and coal combustion outside the utility industry 
spokeswoman robin woods said the schedule for those studies had not 
been decided but the agency intended to complete them 
coal plants produce a lot of waste in 1984 about 69 million 
tons of ash and 16 million tons of sludge from smokestack gas 
scrubbers used to remove sulfur dioxide a pollutant that helps 
form acid rain epa said that in the year 2000 ash probably would 
be 120 million tons and scrubber waste 50 million tons 
utilities spend 800 million a year in disposing of the waste at 
2 to 31 a ton and the requirements for handling and disposal 
under hazardous waste regulation would increase that to 70 per ton 
or 37 billion 
ash and sludge may contain small quantities of arsenic barium 
cadmium chromium lead mercury and selenium in general these do 
not leach out of the material in landfills to the extent that would 
make them hazardous though some samples did indicate hazardous 
levels of cadmium and arsenic epa said

intravenous drug addicts appear to be spreading 
aids in the united states at a higher rate than homosexuals whose 
chances of contracting the disease could decline us surgeon 
general c everett koop said thursday 
addressing the first international conference on the global 
impact of aids koop said surveys in the united states indicate 
that male homosexuals have undergone a very serious and positive 
change in behavior to reduce their risk of contracting aids 
we might even expect a decline in the rate of aids reporting 
from this group in a year or so he told about 1000 health 
specialists from 63 countries at londons barbican center the 
threeday conference closed thursday 
by contrast koop said intravenous drug abusers have yet to 
realize they face a high risk of contracting aids from sharing 
bloodcontaminated needles 
over the years weve been singularly unsuccessful in 
penetrating the drugaddicted culture with every other public 
health message we ever had including the one that says stop 
using drugs koop added 
the us official last january predicted a rise but not an 
explosion in the number of aids cases among heterosexuals 
in an interview with the associated press earlier thursday koop 
said public health officials must find some innovative and 
creative ways of reaching drug abusers who now pose the greatest 
risk of spreading aids to the uninfected us population 
i think the major problem that we have in the states is how to 
reach the intravenous drug abuser which class seems to be the one 
that is spreading the disease most rapidly at the present time 
koop said 
according to the centers for disease control in atlanta 63 
percent of the 55167 cases of aids reported in the united states 
have been among male homosexuals or bisexuals 17 percent among 
intravenous drug abusers and 7 percent among those who fall into 
both categories 
koop said health policymakers should consider setting up a pilot 
needleexchange program to determine whether it could cut the rate 
of aids infection among drug abusers who share needles 
under needleexchange programs tried in western europe drug 
addicts can turn in used needles and syringes for free sterile 
equipment there are conflicting opinions on whether such programs 
have slowed the spread of aids 
while stressing he was not proposing such a plan but rather 
supporting those who call for it koop said drug abuse was the 
likeliest way that aquired immune deficiency syndrome could spread 
through the heterosexual population 
the genevabased world health organization and the london school 
of hygiene and tropical medicine organized the conference to assess 
the economic and social impact of the aids epidemic which has 
spread to at least 133 countries 
speakers discussed problems ranging from the aids threat to the 
mining industry of zambia to efforts to prevent the spread of 
infection in british prisons 
aids is a disease in which a virus attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact but can 
also be transmitted through transfusions of tainted blood or blood 
products aids can also be passed from mother to child at or before 
birth

secretary of state george shultz said thursday 
his plan for bringing arabs and israelis to the negotiating table 
is the only game in town and outlined details for the first 
time in public 
shultz testifying on capitol hill also indicated that the 
united states would continue to push the plan even if israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir rejects it when he holds talks in 
washington next week 
people have looked at our ideas and while nobody is saying 
yes nobody wants to say no because its the only game in town 
shultz said 
people will probably would even dodge and object and so on 
but were going to keep working and see if we cant bring something 
out of this he added 
shamir has opposed the shultz plan because it sets a timetable 
for negotiations between israel and the arabs on the future of the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
president reagan meanwhile said in an interview thursday that 
a great element of israels coalition government supports the 
peace plan and that he will try to persuade shamir to drop his 
objections to the proposal 
i believe that peace is inevitable reagan said we may 
have some differences there as to how to achieve it but i dont 
think anyone believes that we can go on just with a constant state 
of warfare and unrest in the middle east 
shultz in testimony to the house appropriations foreign 
operations subcommittee said the united states feels time is 
awasting and wants talks between israel and arab countries to 
begin by may 1 the talks would be under the auspices of the five 
permanent members of the un security council the united states 
the soviet union china england and france 
it is essential particularly from the standpoint of the arab 
side that there be an auspices for these negotiations something 
that gives them legitimacy he said 
we proposed that this conference initiate these bilateral 
negotiations that it be a body that can receive reports from the 
parties on the status of their negotiations but that the 
conference will not be able to impose solutions or veto agreements 
reached 
in what appeared a slight shift shultz did not insist as he has 
in the past that the soviets could only participate if they resumed 
the diplomatic tiesthey broke with israel in 1967 
however i have told the soviets that whether they come to 
a conference or not they cannot expect to play a genuinely 
involved role in middle east affairs until they reestablish 
official relations with israel and ease their restrictions on 
jewish emigration he said 
in the plan he presented to israeli and arab leaders last week 
shultz stipulated that all the participants must recognize un 
resolution 242 and 338 which call for israel to return lands it 
captured from the arabs in the 1967 mideast war in return the 
arab states would have to recognize the jewish states right to 
exist 
shultz did not speak directly of the three months of 
israelipalestinian clashes in which more than 80 arabs have been 
killed but he referred to it saying that peoples minds are a 
little more open now than theyve been in some time and we should 
take advantage of that 
under the plan the palestinians would be represented by a joint 
delegation with jordan shultz said 
the initial negotiations would address transitional 
arrangements for three years of palestinian selfrule he said 
the united states would present a draft proposal as a preliminary 
working paper 
such negotiations could be concluded within six months because 
much of the preparatory work has been completed he said 
the transitional arrangement could be put into place within 
three months after the end of the negotiations immediately 
following the sixmonth negotiations the sides would begin 
yearlong talks on the final status of the territories he said

republican presidential candidate bob dole jabbed 
at vice president george bush on thursday saying his rival for the 
gop nomination was hiding from america 
dole after touring a rehabilitation hospital stepped up his 
attacks on the vice president for not agreeing to oneonone 
debates before next tuesdays illinois primary 
i dont think he wants to stand up without notes and talk 
about issues dole said its not a strength of his his 
strength is to run these tv ads that distort somebodys record 
dole apparently was referring to television spots that the bush 
campaign has used to raise questions about the kansas senators 
position on taxes dole blames his campaigns failure to 
effectively counter the ads for his loss in new hampshire 
i think hes going to play it safe dole said of bush 
hes not going to debate bob dole he wouldnt dare debate bob 
dole for two hours without notes without roger ailes 
ailes is a media consultant 
at nearly every campaign stop since he arrived in illinois on 
tuesday dole has hammered away at bush and challenged him to speak 
out on the issues 
its almost impossible to separate bush from president 
reagan because hes been standing next to him for seven years 
dole said unfortunately i didnt have time to stand there i 
had to get reagans program passed 
dole also is questioning bushs electability saying he 
would be a stronger candidate for the party to field against 
democrats in november 
my view is its going to be a very tough tough race for 
george bush said dole he does not attract democrats or 
independents 
dole said he would seek out supporters of rep jack kemp now 
that the new york republican has pulled out of the presidential 
race he expects to soon receive the endorsement of rep henry 
hyde rill a key kemp backer in the state 
dole said he faces a steep hill to climb to defeat bush 
i have to do very well in this state dole said 
does that mean winning that means doing very well 
dole seemed to be backing off slightly from statements on 
wednesday that illinois was a mustwin state for his struggling 
candidacy but he dismissed questions from reporters on whether he 
was scaling down his expectations in the state 
doles first stop on thursday was to the rehabilitation 
institute of chicago where he toured the hospital and greeted 
patients many of whom were confined to wheelchairs 
the medical center is just a short distance away from another 
hospital where dole underwent surgery 40 years ago for wounds he 
suffered in world war ii 
one woman patient told dole youre not going to get 
bushwhacked in the midwest 
dole gave words of encouragement to some of the patients and 
told them how it was difficult for him to regain the use of one of 
his arms which had been paralyzed 
i dont give up easy im like everybody in this building 
dole said after his tour you wouldnt walk out of here if you 
gave up easy so im a fighter

a pact allowing japan to retrieve plutonium 
from us nuclear wastes would leave the united states without 
effective control over reprocessing of the hazardous material 
the general accounting office has concluded 
the gao the investigative arm of congress also found fault 
with the agreements provisions to guard against proliferation of 
plutonium the principal element in nuclear weapons and said it 
deprived congress of its oversight function 
opponents of the accord said they had failed to work out a 
compromise with the state department and may move to kill the 
agreement next week 
the accord signed last november gives japan advance permission 
for 30 years to recover plutonium from the fuel the united states 
supplies for its nuclear power plants after it is used 
congressional opponents wanted the united states to have the 
right to review the use of plutonium in any future japanese 
facilities on a casebycase basis and to be able to suspend 
the agreement in a terrorism threat or other national security 
situations 
the congressional foes also sought to have the agreement 
reviewed every five years 
these changes would require renegotiating the terms with japan 
which the state department declined to do said a congressional 
source speaking only on condition of anonymity 
a leading opponent sen alan cranston dcalif said it is 
extremely unfortunate the state department has rejected a 
compromise agreement it is a bad agreement it has serious flaws 
cranston chairman of the senate asia subcommittee called on 
the reagan administration to withdraw the accord otherwise he 
said it faces growing opposition in congress 
the gao report was written by milton socolar a special 
assistant to the us comptroller general and was dated feb 29 
it was obtained thursday 
the report said the agreement does not meet various requirements 
of the atomic energy act it said giving blanket approval to 
japan for reprocessing plutonium would leave the united states 
with no effective control over the life of the proposed agreement 
a us official involved in the negotiations said however the 
safeguard concepts in the pact are adequate and that the 
agreement could be suspended in the event of proliferation or a 
terrorist threat 
the official speaking only if not named said the agreement 
makes sure terrorists cannot get into the facilities 
in december the senate foreign relations committee in an 
unusual move voted 153 to return the pact to president reagan and 
asked that it be renegotiated opponents argued it sets a precedent 
to encourage potentially hazardous trade in plutonium which is a 
potent cancercausing agent 
opponents also complained the plutonium would be shipped over 
alaska and possibly other areas of the united states 
on tuesday the state department said the plutonium would be 
shipped in accordance with rigorous physical protection and 
safety requirements 
a statement issued by the nonproliferation office said planes 
carrying the plutonium soon will be able to fly nonstop from 
europe to japan taking a polar route this would avoid overflights 
of the united states canada or any other country 
the administration is therefore prepared to rule out air 
shipments of plutonium under the agreement from overflying or 
landing in the united states except in the case of aircraft 
emergency the statement said 
under the agreement japan would ship the spent nuclear fuel to 
reprocessing plants in britain or france which would separate 
plutonium from the waste the plutonium then would be shipped back 
to japan by air 
the congressional source said the statement was designed to ease 
the concerns of sen frank h murkowski ralaska but did not 
basically alter the flaws in the agreement 
also the source said richard n perle and frank gaffney 
former defense department officials wrote members of congress 
urging rejection of the agreement as seriously flawed and 
complaining that the pentagon was not permitted to play a 
meaningful role in the negotiations with japan 
fortyfive tons of plutonium could be airlifted from europe to 
japan by the year 2000 under the pact it takes 15 pounds to make a 
bomb 
congress has until april 25 to block the agreement with japan or 
it takes effect

secretary of state george p shultz on 
thursday called us foreign aid embarrassingly low compared with 
the effort made by western european countries 
he was challenging rep david r obey dwis who chaired a 
hearing at which shultz testified 
mr chairman you talked about burden sharing but if we 
compared our effort in that regard with our european friends i 
think we would see a somewhat embarrassing picture shultz said 
he was immediately supported by the member who had been 
questioning him rep john edward porter rill 
its shameful mr secretary its absolutely shameful 
porter said i certainly agree with you 
shultz was apparently referring to figures for 1986 compiled by 
the organization for economic cooperation and development which 
show that total us development aid is high 956 billion for 
1986 but low as a proportion of us wealth 
the oecd calculates that us aid amounted to 023 percent of 
the countrys total production by that measure norway was at the 
top of the list with 12 percent of its production an effort more 
than five times greater the united states was close to the bottom 
of the list only austria was lower with 021 percent 
shultz also made a comparison with the soviet union 
the fact of the matter is the soviets are spending 
considerably more than we are in what we classify as as economic 
and security assistance he said and their economy is half the 
size of ours so that our effort is relatively small 
according to the us agency for international development the 
soviets spent 368 billion on economic aid in 1986 equal to 033 
percent of their national production 
obey had begun the hearing with an explanation of why congress 
provided smaller amounts for aid than had been requested by the 
administration for countries where the united states has military 
bases 
we felt that the united states is getting the shaft from our 
allies in terms of burden sharing around the world he said 
and we feel its the obligation of our european allies to 
carry a greater share of the load in supporting common defense 
efforts so its not that we have any policy dislike for spain 
or for portugal or for greece or for any of the other countries 
involved he said 
its simply that when the us taxpayer spends 1100 on 
average to support military and foreign expenditures and the 
west german taxpayer spends 450 and the spanish taxpayer spends 
113 and the average for europe is 318 we feel those are not good 
conditions under which we ought to be making large commitments of 
expenditures he said 
obey who chairs the foreign operations subcommittee of the 
house appropriations committee also complained of administration 
proposals to lower spending on some domestic programs for education 
and lowcost housing

the corporation for public broadcasting told 
congress on thursday it needs 200 million to replace an aging 
satellite system that is due to expire in 1991 
donald ledwig cpb president told a house energy and commerce 
subcommittee that unless the satellite system is replaced the 
skies will go dark for public radio and television stations that 
rely on it to receive programming from the public broadcasting 
service 
without funding for the satellite there would be no way to 
replace it unless we pulled it out of our budget which would 
leave little money for anything else ledwig said 
cpb is asking congress to authorize 395 million for cpbs 
general operations for the year beginning oct 1 1991 the board 
also proposes its federal support be increased to 411 million in 
fiscal year 1992 and to 427 million in fiscal year 1993 the 200 
million for a new satellite system would be additional 
the reagan administration in its recent budget proposal asked 
congress to freeze cpbs funding at its current level of 214 
million for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 and did not include any 
funds for a new satellite system congress previously had 
authorized cpb to receive 228 million in 1989 and 233 in fiscal 
1990 
rep edward markey dmass chairman of the telecommunications 
subcommittee has introduced legislation that would split the 
difference between what cpb wants and what the administration is 
proposing 
some on the subcommittee however said that at a time of 
soaring budget deficits public broadcasters cannot count on 
increasing their federal support 
rep michael g oxley rohio said public broadcasters should 
consider limited advertising between programs an a way to fill 
their budget gaps 
i am troubled by the intransigence of the public 
broadcasting system on this important question oxley said 
the public broadcasting act prohibits advertising on public 
radio and tv stations but oxley said this raises constitutional 
freespeech questions

the un human rights commission accepted fidel 
castros invitation thursday to send its first delegation to cuba 
to investigate allegations of human rights abuses 
the 43nation body approved without a vote the decision drafted 
by four latin american countries to accept the invitation cuba 
extended wednesday 
plans are for a sixmember delegation including the chairman of 
the un commission to visit the caribbean island this year and 
report to the 1989 meeting 
before the decision the united states and latin american 
countries led by argentina colombia mexico and peru spent a day 
negotiating acceptable conditions for a visit 
in another action thursday the commission condemned chiles 
military government for violations including murder kidnapping and 
torture by security forces continued curbs on basic civil rights 
and intimidation by authorities 
a resolution passed 340 cited acts of extreme violence from 
all sources in chile which have exacerbated the climate of 
insecurity seven countries abstained including the united 
states japan and brazil and two did not vote 
armando valladares a former cuban political prisoner who heads 
the us delegation to the rights commission told a news 
conference the twoyear us effort to have the commission examine 
cuba had forced castros hand 
this visit has not been a voluntary gesture by cuba he 
said speaking in spanish with simultaneous translation 
a day of negotiations produced conditions and guarantees for 
an impartial visit that did not exist when cuba extended the 
invitation wednesday said valladares who was released from 22 
years in a cuban prison six years ago he called the commission 
decision a triumph for human rights 
an official of the un center for human rights kf nyamekye 
said it was understood that the six members commission chairman 
alioune sene of senegal and five others to be chosen geographically 
would meet in geneva for a week in may or june to plan their work 
cuba has been cited for such human rights violations as torture 
and mistreatment of political prisoners by the united states and 
international organizations including amnesty international 
castros government denies the charges and fought the us 
effort to put its human rights situation on the agenda of the 
commission which meets every year for six weeks debate 
intensified this year when valladares who wrote a book about 
mistreatment and torture in prison was chosen to lead the us 
delegation 
after thursdays decision the united states withdrew a 
resolution calling for the un secretarygeneral to examine the 
human rights situation in cuba and report to the commission 
valladares said the plan adopted goes far beyond what we had 
originally asked for it is very important 
a member of the cuban delegation said it would not have a 
statement thursday 
the document approved is brief and does not give conditions of 
the visit saying only that a sixmember team should visit cuba 
in order to observe the human rights situation and prepare a 
report 
sene told the organization the investigating team would have 
unrestricted access to information while in cuba 
they will visit cuba for about five days in july or august 
then reconvene in geneva in january to consider and adopt their 
report said nyamekye

dartmouth college suspended two members of 
a conservative student newspaper for two years thursday and another 
for two terms for harassing a black professor in his classroom 
a fourth student staffer for the independent dartmouth review 
was placed on disciplinary probation for one year for disorderly 
conduct 
the four white students had faced possible expulsion over a feb 
25 confrontation with music professor william cole over a review 
article criticizing his class and his teaching ability 
the article and the confrontation had drawn allegations of 
racism against the review and prompted demonstrations by black 
students at the ivy league school 
the penalties imposed by the studentfaculty dartmouth committee 
on standards take effect wednesday the end of the current academic 
term 
christopher baldwin of hinsdale ill john quilhot of fort 
wayne ind john sutter of st louis and sean nolan of lexington 
mass were charged with harassment disorderly conduct and 
invasion of privacy 
baldwin a junior who is the review editor and sutter a senior 
who is its executive editor were suspended until the fall of 1989 
or six terms 
quilhot a sophomore photographer was suspended for two terms 
nolan a freshman contributor to the paper was placed on 
probation dartmouth operates on a threeterm college year 
baldwin said the students will appeal 
i knew we were going to get a sentence like that when we 
walked into the hearing baldwin said the hearing was 
conducted in a lynchmob hysteria 
they did what was politically expedient not what was right 
he said 
the disciplinary panel found all four guilty of disorderly 
conduct for failure to leave coles classroom after being asked 
repeatedly to leave 
baldwin was guilty of harassment for initiating and persisting 
in a vexatious oral exchange with cole and sutter was guilty 
of repeated aggressive confrontational and particularly 
vexatious behavior the committee said 
cole a specialist in africanamerican music and author of books 
on jazz musicians john coltrane and miles davis sued the review 
for libel five years ago over an article questioning his competence 
and saying he looks like a used brillo pad cole later dropped 
the suit 
during nearly 16 hours of hearings last weekend the four 
students proclaimed their innocence and denied any racial 
motivation 
founded in 1980 with support from such conservatives as patrick 
buchanan and william f buckley the review repeatedly has been 
accused of insensitivity to blacks women and homosexuals 
baldwin led the group that approached cole in a recital hall 
after the professor finished a class 
baldwin said the review wanted to give cole another chance to 
respond to an article in the review several days earlier in that 
article the review printed remarks including profanities that 
cole made in a telephone interview 
witnesses who testified before the committee last weekend agreed 
that cole became agitated and yelled and cursed when the four 
approached him cole testified that he felt harassed and provoked 
and he accused the review of bigotry 
the invasion of privacy charge arose because cole was 
photographed and taperecorded without permission 
one witness luzmila johnson head of the afroamerican society 
at dartmouth testified that sutter uttered a racial slur as he 
left the recital hall sutter vehemently denied the charge 
two years ago 12 people most of them review members mounted a 
sledgehammer attack on symbolic antiapartheid shanties on the 
college green 
three of the students were suspended seven others received 
communityservice sentences including baldwin 
dartmouth has nearly 4100 undergraduates nearly 7 percent of 
them black

republican party officials said 
thursday they intend to award puerto ricos 14 gop national 
convention votes to vice president george bush and are considering 
calling off the primary to do it 
we havent canceled the primary but we are considering every

campaign manager jose dapena thompson said the reason is simple 
the nomination of george bush has been practically assured 
however the underlying issues at stake turn more on statehood 
for the us commonwealth than on presidential politics 
the republican primary is scheduled for march 20 when voters 
are to cast ballots for slates committed to bush his main rival 
sen bob dole rkan or any other republican candidate as a 
writein 
bush needs 1139 votes to win the gop presidential nomination 
his total thursday was 705 
doles campaign chairman in puerto rico alejandro cruz agreed 
with dapena thompson but he too was unsure whether it was 
possible to cancel the primary or somehow to require doles 14 
delegates to vote instead for bush 
the republican party will meet saturday to review its 
alternatives 
a democratic primary also is set for march 20 at which 51 
puerto ricos national elegates are at stake

as other americans with the exception that they cannot vote for 
president or congress and pay no federal taxes 
the popular democratic party of gov rafael hernandez colon 
favors a continuation of commonwealth or limited autonomy the 
opposition new progressive party which has strong ties with the

four presidential candidates two republicans 
and two democrats have sided with deaf students at gallaudet 
university who want a hearingimpaired person to head their school 
sen bob dole rkan was the first to support the idea with a 
letter on feb 18 before the selection of elisabeth ann zinser was 
made zinser who was named the schools president on sunday is 
not deaf and does not know sign language 
in his letter dole noted the accomplishments of gallaudet 
which is the nations only school for the deaf and asked isnt 
it time for the university to once again lead the way instead of 
following it and place a deaf individual in a position of public 
responsibility 
vice president george bushs support came next in a letter 
march 1 to the committee searching for a new school president 
as an entity funded by the federal government gallaudet has a 
responsibility to set an example and thus to appoint a president 
who is not only highly qualified but who is also deaf he wrote 
the march 6 appointment of zinser an administrator at the 
university of north carolina at greensboro set off demonstrations 
by students alumni and faculty at gallaudet that have virtually 
paralyzed the campus 
the protests drew support from two democratic presidential 
hopefuls 
democrat jesse jackson on wednesday issued a statement 
supporting the demonstrations and saying the problem is not that 
the students do not hear the problem is that the hearing world 
does not listen 
illinois sen paul simon also running for the democratic 
nomination on thursday called for zinsers resignation 
simon a longtime member of the senate labor and human resources 
subcommittee on the handicapped which has jurisdiction over 
funding for gallaudet said zinsers appointment was a slap in 
the face to the entire purpose of the university 
simon who wears two hearing aids to compensate for a hearing 
impairment cited the job listing placed by the schools 
presidential search committee which said in part 
broad and deep knowledge of deafness and the variety of issues 
important to the higher education of hearing impaired persons is 
necessary 
even if elisabeth zinser were deaf simon said the fact 
that she doesnt meet this qualification demonstrates that she is 
not the best candidate for the job

tate said more than half the campaigns 300 staffers were being 
laid off 
she declined to say who among the national staff was being let 
go saying workers were still being notified thursday evening 
it is significant it ranges from the top to the bottom in 
every department she said of the layoffs 
some of the layoffs had been planned for the period following 
super tuesday regardless of its outcome she said 
but doles campaign was reeling from its complete 17state loss 
on that day vice president bush won in 16 of the states and took a 
giant step toward the gop nomination 
you have a much different campaign staff when youre trying to 
compete in 17 states at once rather than one at a time she said 
she said the key members of doles traveling staff would be 
unaffected by the cutbacks naming press secretary mari maseng 
adviser thomas rath campaign chairman william brock and consultant 
kim wells 
she said the campaign would keep a full complement of staff 
in illinois 
the news of the cutbacks came as dole continued to campaign in 
illinois a state he said on wednesday that he had to win 
on thursday he appeared to back off on that contention saying 
instead he had to do very well in the state he dismissed 
questions from reporters on whether he was scaling down his 
expectations in the state 
at one point however he addressed the possibility of dropping 
out saying ive been in this business long enough to know that 
there comes a time you have to say well maybe it would happen

african governments more than nature now cause 
the famines that threaten millions of lives a reagan 
administration official told congress thursday 
although natural factors are still present and important in 
each of these countries manmade factors predominate and drive the 
seemingly intractable emergency situations and everescalating 
needs said charles l gladson assistant administrator for 
africa of the agency for international development 
he listed as the most obvious factors 
internal strife and civil wars 
policies that fail to give incentives to farmers to grow enough 
food 
poorly developed infrastructure such as roads and railroads 
governments incapable of coordinating relief 
gladsons testimony was prepared for a hearing by the house 
select committee on hunger and the foreign affairs subcommittee 
that deals with africa the hearing dealt with the crisis in 
angola mozambique ethiopia and sudan 
even in the best of times ethiopia cannot feed itself with 
its current policies said roy stacy deputy assistant secretary 
of state for africa 
the us government alone spent over 600 million for 
emergency aid to save lives but without incentive farming policies 
such assistance does not result in recovery and provides little 
resistance to the next drought he said 
according to the hunger committee a drought in ethiopia has 
again resulted in crop failures and a food deficit of 13 million 
metric tons with 52 million to 8 million people at risk it said 
the us government has provided more than 100 million in aid in 
the current crisis 
the administration view was endorsed by rep tony roth rwis 
ethiopia mozambique and angola is there some reason that 
mother nature has singled out these three countries by chance i 
dont think so he said 
all of these countries share one other common trait their 
disastrous agricultural yields can be directly attributed to the 
failures of collectivized farming and to a patent disegard for 
human life he said 
all three have communist governments 
he complained that a proposed resolution on famine relief 
introduced by rep tony p hall dohio and mickey leland 
dtexas contained no condemnation of the ethiopian government of 
mengistu hailemariam for withholding food as a means of combatting 
rebel forces 
he also criticized the proposed resolution for suggesting that 
the us government prevent refugees from crossing borders or going 
into relief camps 
it seems to me altogether inappropriate for it to to be a 
policy of the us government to prevent people from voting with 
their feet and escaping from a brutal dictatorship he said

two 13yearold girls were found guilty of 
involuntary manslaughter thursday in the slaying of a 12yearold 
boy who was forced to drink lighter fluid and suffocated with a 
plastic bag over his head 
police said the girls feb 8 helped two teenagers get into the 
victims apartment where the boys attacked antonio r cooley for 
not letting them use a videotape recorder 
the 15yearold boys sprayed cooley with insecticide and forced 
him to drink charcoal lighter fluid while he screamed for his life 
authorities said a deputy coroner said cooley was suffocated with 
a bag 
as judge arthur o fisher of juvenile court read the verdict in 
the nonjury trial the two girls sat almost motionless and one 
mouthed a curse the other clutched a stuffed bear and sobbed 
lightly as she was led away 
they were also found guilty of grand theft for helping steal 
cooleys stereo and videotape recorder 
the girls whose identities were not released because of their 
age were being held in a youth detention center 
the judge could order them held for a year and state officials 
then could decide whether to hold them until age 21 siad assistant 
prosecutor debra armanini no sentencing date was set 
the judge said the girls helped the two boys get into cooleys 
apartment while his father was at work knowing the boys intended 
to beat cooley and steal several electronic items 
prosecutors are seeking to have the two 15yearolds tried as 
adults on charges including aggravated murder and aggravated 
robbery 
defense attorneys argued the girls did not know cooley was to 
die but the judge said even if the girls had warned cooley as 
they testified they still were guilty for not trying to prevent 
the attack 
a 13yearold accomplice has pleaded guilty to involuntary 
manslaughter and theft and awaits sentencing the defense at the 
girls trial contended the 13yearold kept the girls in a back 
room while the older boys did the killing 
i think the verdict sends a message across this city that the 
courts are not going to permit anyone no matter what their age to 
take part in a scheme or plan to snuff out another life said 
assistant prosecutor mathias heck jr

col jeanclaude paul is a 
household name in the capital portauprince but one that few 
people are comfortable speaking out loud 
paul was indicted wednesday on drug trafficking charges in us 
district court in miami but many radio stations in the haitian 
capital chose not to broadcast the news of those that did only 
one the roman catholic station radio soleil identified paul by 
name 
were not yet going to announce the news for security 
reasons a reporter at the independent station radio metropole 
said thursday speaking on condition of anonymity weve already 
received threats well announce the news when its formally made 
public 
paul has been prominent in the impoverished caribbean nation of 
6 million since he was promote to colonel and given command of the 
700man dessalines battalion in january 1986 
the battalion quartered in a lowslung mustard colored 
building adjacent to the national palace was involved in almost 
every incident last summer in which soldiers broke up peaceful 
antigovernment demonstrations more than 30 people were killed and 
200 wounded 
opposition leaders blame the battalion for standing by idly nov 
29 while gunmen in the capital killed at least 34 people forcing 
the cancellation of what would have been haitis first free 
presidential vote in 30 years 
paul refused requests to be interviewed at that time his 
colleagues and superiors have publicly defended and shielded him 
leslie manigat was elected president jan 17 in balloting 
boycotted by the opposition and marked by widespread irregularities 
a communique three weeks ago by army chief of staff gen carl 
nicolas rebutted the socalled involvement of paul in affairs 
of drug trafficking 
col gary leon a spokesman for the military refused a request 
thursday by the associated press for biographical information on 
paul 
nevertheless a sketchy picture of paul emerged from interviews 
with acquaintances colleagues and foreign observers most of whom 
spoke on condition their names not be used 
paul was born in 1938 to a family that supported dictator 
francois papa doc duvalier 
his father was a highranking member of the tontons macoute 
private militia it was organized by duvalier to throttle political 
opposition and challenge the power of the army which launched 
several coups against duvalier after his election in 1957 
pauls brother alexandre was haitis consul general to the 
bahamas and the united states based in miami until the duvalier 
family dictatorship ended in february 1986 with the flight of 
jeanclaude duvalier to france following popular demonstrations 
as a young officer paul was a protege of francois duvaliers 
finance minister clovis desinor he rose through the ranks during 
the 1970s and served with the elite leopards counterinsurgency 
squad before taking command of the dessalines battalion 
rumors of pauls alleged involvement with cocaine trafficking 
surfaced in march 1987 when his exwife marie merielle delinois 
was arrested in miami on drug charges she pleaded innocent was 
released on 250000 bond and promptly fled 
paul and his brother antonio face three drug counts conspiracy 
to distribute distribution and attempted importation of cocaine 
into the united states they could face up to 45 years in prison 
and 375000 in fines if they are convicted ms delinois was also 
indicted 
jeanclaude pauls activity in cocaine smuggling is well 
known said one western diplomat in a recent interview he has 
a landing strip near thomozeau a village about 90 miles 
northeast of the capital near haitis border with the dominican 
republic 
raymond joseph publisher of the brooklyn nybased newspaper 
haiti observateur said the colonel has several houses in and 
around the capital in addition to a cattle ranch in thomozeau 
paul a short stocky man who customarily wears a ring bracelet 
and necklace of heavy gold lives above his salary of 1800 a 
month said joseph 
the mission of dessalines battalion is to help police provide 
order in the capital paul is seen most frequently in public 
providing security for top government officials 
the western diplomat said paul is popular with his troops and 
pays them extra from his own pocket 
he paul ignores the chain of command said the diplomat 
who added that paul incorporated about 100 tontons macoutes into 
his battalion and helped others flee haiti at the end of the 
duvalier dictatorship 
he is capable of making a coup detat the diplomat said

howard stern a radio personality known for his 
outrageous innuendolaced broadcasts is the target of a federal 
investigation begun after he bragged on the air about getting drugs 
for someone according to a published report 
the new york daily news on wednesday said it learned of the 
investigation from a letter to the newspaper from michael levine a 
drug enforcement administration agent 
levine said stern who has come under fire from the federal 
communications commission for his broadcasts bragged on his 
morning radio show monday of getting drugs for an unidentified 
guest on his cable tv special howard sterns underpants and 
negligee party shown feb 27 
maybe somebody should have warned him stern that he was 
admitting to the commission of a federal and state felony levine 
said 
the daily news citing unidentified sources said that dea 
agents had taken the unusual step of clearing the investigation 
with the us attorneys office because of sterns habit of making 
outrageous statements on radio investigators wanted to know if the 
office would press charges the newspaper said 
robert stutman head of the new york dea office said levines 
letter was written without his offices knowledge he declined 
comment on any investigation 
stern whose morning radio program is heard on wxrkfm in new 
york and on wyspfm in philadelphia could not be reached for 
comment a message left at the new york station was not immediately 
returned thursday 
sterns radio broadcasts are filled with veiled and obvious 
references to sex and other bodily functions he testified at an 
fcc hearing in april and the commission warned him to avoid 
certain sexual innuendoes and double entenderes 
the fcc said sterns broadcasts dwelt on sexual and excretory 
matters in a pandering and titillating fashion that was patently 
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards 
but because the fccs own standards for decency may have been 
unclear the commission said it was forced to limit its sanction 
against stern to a warning

a 15yearold boy who beat a classmate to 
death with a baseball bat to find out what it was like to kill 
someone was convicted of seconddegree murder thursday and 
sentenced to life in prison 
rod matthews who was 14 when he lured shaun ouillette into the 
woods with a promise of fireworks showed no emotion when the 
verdict was announced he had been expressionless throughout the 
weeklong trial sitting with his eyes downcast 
matthews will be eligible for parole in 15 years 
carrying a portrait of her son and choking back tears jeanne 
quinn the victims mother said she had hoped matthews would not 
be eligible for parole which would have been the case if he had 
been convicted of firstdegree murder 
he planned this im sorry fifteen years no im sorry 
thats wrong said mrs quinn shaun is not coming home in 15 
years is he hes not ever coming home 
the trial in this suburb 15 miles south of boston was 
highlighted by graphic descriptions of the slaying and testimony 
from two young people who described how matthews plotted the 
killing and then took them to see the bludgeoned body in the woods 
in canton 
matthews family including two sisters and a brother was 
escorted out of court by officers shielding them from journalists 
kenneth matthews the father said he felt his son belonged in a 
treatment facility rather than in prison 
matthews becomes the youngest of more than 6500 inmates in the 
states prisons possibly the youngest ever said correction 
department spokeswoman mary mcgeown 
its terrible said matthews mother janice a child 
shouldnt be persecuted and forced to go through something like 
this theyre children god only knows how much worse its going to 
make his condition 
defense attorney john philip white had argued that matthews 
should be acquitted by reason of insanity he portrayed him as a 
mentally unstable child whose pleas for help were ignored by 
teachers and friends and as someone adversely affected by taking 
the drug ritalin to control hyeractivity 
white said after the verdict that he was concerned about 
matthews safety at the adult prison at walpole and about the 
suicidal ideation he has shown 
norfolk county superior court judge roger j donahue said 
defense attorneys could appeal the verdict within 30 days donahue 
rejected a defense motion to reconsider the sentence and classify 
matthews as a juvenile 
the jurors had deliberated for nearly 10 hours over two days 
before making their decision 
norfolk county assistant district attorney peter casey called 
the decision an appropriate wellcounseled verdict 
the widely publicized case was compared to the trial of anthony 
broussard 18 sentenced to 25 years to life in 1982 in san jose 
calif for killing his girlfriend broussard took at least 13 
schoolmates to see the victims body and the movie the rivers 
edge was based on that case 
two child behavior specialists testified that matthews did not 
experience classic symptoms of psychosis and that continued use of 
ritalin could not have triggered violent behavior 
but a doctor said monday that matthews irrational conduct may 
have been exacerbated by the drug which matthews had been taking 
since the third grade 
two friends of matthews rob peterson and jonathan cash 
testified earlier this week that matthews told them of his desire 
to kill in the fall of 1986 they said two potential victims were 
mentioned and rejected before matthews decided on ouillette 
no charges were filed against peterson and cash 
matthews chose ouillette because he felt he would not be missed 
the teenagers said ouillette 14 was relatively new to canton 
his family having moved there two years before the slaying 
witnesses said matthews befriended ouillette before he lured him 
to the wooded area after school on nov 20 1986 he hit ouillette 
on the head with a baseball bat at least three times matthews 
recalled ouillette cried for help the friends testified 
matthews took peterson to see the body several hours after the 
slaying and they hid a knife matthews planned to use to cut off 
ouillettes arms and legs 
several days later peterson and cash went with matthews to see 
the body after a prethanksgiving pep rally at canton high school 
police found the body on dec 15 1986 after receiving an 
anonymous letter sent by cash 
matthews told a psychiatric counselor after the slaying that he 
first decided to kill someone after viewing the videotape faces 
of death which depicts animal and human deaths

seagram co said thursday it is buying the makers 
of tropicana orange juice in a 12 billion transaction dubbed the 
screwdriver deal 
we have already broadened our base with seagrams wine 
coolers and tropicana is another step in this direction 
chairman edgar m bronfman said in announcing the purchase of 
tropicana products from beatrice us food corp 
the deal will be financed initially with a combination of bank 
loans and shortterm borrowings said the canadian liquor and 
beverage giant 
market watchers jokingly called the sale the screwdriver 
deal in a reference to the popular cocktail made of vodka and 
orange juice 
montrealbased seagram is best known for its distilled spirits 
and wines but in recent years has moved into the manufacturing of 
wine coolers and sells cocktail mixers such as tonic seltzer and 
ginger ale under the seagrams name 
seagram is also acquiring french cognac producer martell amp co 
securities analysts said the move into the orange juice business 
was a logical step for seagram 
they understand the business and its growing unlike most of 
their liquor products said ian osler an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities in toronto 
however the new york creditrating firm standard amp poors corp 
said the pending sale had negative debt implications for both 
seagram and beatrice 
sampp said the deal would reduce seagrams dependence on distilled 
spirits but increase the companys debt load raising questions 
about seagrams ability to absorb both tropicana and martell 
tropicana with headquarters in bradenton fla had sales of 
about 750 million in its last fiscal year which ended feb 29 
said marcelline thomson a seagram spokeswoman 
seagram earned nearly 4235 billion on sales of 33 billion in 
the fiscal year ending jan 31 1987 and reported a profit of more 
than 4024 million on sales of 26 billion for the nine months 
ending oct 31 ms thomson said 
beatrice us food corp based in chicago is a division of 
beatrice co whose holdings include hunts tomato products wesson 
oil swiftekrich inc meats peter pan peanut butter and orville

gov evan mechams last chief of staff 
testified thursday that he would not have responded as the governor 
did to reports that another official threatened a former mecham 
aide who was a grand jury witness 
but richard burke a former us attorney and justice deparment 
official who was the first defense witness at mechams impeachment 
trial refused to say whether he thought the governor obstructed 
the investigation of the alleged threat 
i dont think i should comment on that burke said as 
members of the arizona senate pressed him for a legal opinion i 
think the governor would have a very different view of that than i 
would 
mecham 63 is accused of obstructing justice by telling the 
states top police official not to give the attorney general 
information about the alleged threat 
he also is accused of concealing a 350000 campaign loan and 
misusing 80000 from a state fund but the senate is hearing 
testimony on the obstruction charge first 
mecham who has not appeared at the impeachment trial since it 
began feb 29 also faces a criminal trial april 21 on felony 
charges of concealing the 350000 and a recall election may 17 
the firstterm republican is the first us governor to be 
impeached in six decades 
burke who tried to reorganize the chaotic mecham offices in the 
two months before the governors impeachment said he believed that 
the reported threat was serious and that mecham should have fired 
the accused aide lee watkins much earlier than he did 
i certainly took it as a serious threat said burke it 
wasnt a threat of tiddlywinks i think all of us assumed it was a 
crime or a potential crime or it wouldnt have been reported to 
us 
according to testimony in the impeachment trial mecham first 
was told nov 13 that watkins threatened former mecham adviser 
donna carlson saying she might go on a long boat ride if she 
talked to a grand jury investigating finances of mechams 1986 
campaign 
watkins has denied threatening ms carlson last week he refused 
to testify when called as a prosecution witness 
ralph milstead director of the department of public safety 
said he was told nov 15 by mecham to refuse any request for 
information by the attorney general he has said he did cooperate 
however 
mecham has testified in house impeachment hearings that he may 
have told milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general 
in other developments a secretary to peggy griffith the 
official who first reported the alleged death threat said that her 
boss often exaggerated things and that she questioned mrs 
griffiths version of what occurred 
but when senators asked her for examples of exaggerations the 
secretary terri elaine fields paused and said i cant even 
think of any right now 
under questioning by mecham attorney fred craft burke said the 
governor was illserved by his subordinates because they did not 
give him complete information on the alleged threat quickly enough 
but on crossexamination house prosecutor william french honed 
in on mechams exact instructions to milstead would you say 
this dont tell the attorney general anything 
no said burke 
would you say this to col milstead never dont give him 
any help 
no said burke 
burke in apparent agreement with a number of prosecution 
witnesses said political loyalty impelled the governor to ignore 
staff warnings and support watkins 
why was mr watkins not let go at an earlier date asked 
democratic sen lela alston 
burke replied that mecham ignored nearly unanimous advice from 
his staff to fire watkins 
i think the governor felt a great deal of loyalty to mr 
watkins said the witness because mr watkins hd been very 
active and supportive of his campaign 
prosecution witnesses have suggested watkins won favor by 
raising money for mechams campaign they said watkins told of 
being rewarded with a state job and intimated he had information 
which could bring down the mecham administration 
a twothirds vote in the senate is required to convict mecham on 
impeachment charges and remove him from office senators then could 
take another vote and forbid him from holding state office again

a swiss tycoon involved in a plan to build 
an iraqi oil pipeline attended an event thursday with shimon peres 
whom he allegedly tried to bribe into guaranteeing the lines 
safety 
bruce rappaport joined the foreign minister at a haifa 
university symposium on heart disease which rappaport financed he 
denied offering peres a bribe and said he would tell all at the 
appropriate time and place about the 1 billion pipeline project 
peres angrily brushed aside questions about the pipeline case 
which also has been linked to edwin meese iii the us attorney 
general 
my name is not connected with anything and i dont want you to 
connect it peres said interrupting a reporter did anyone say 
they gave me anything did anyone say they promised me anything 
please a little fairness 
rappaport told reporters israel lost 6070 million because the 
project was not built the sum it was to receive for promising not 
to bomb the line 
he said peres then prime minister gave the guarantee after 
consulting yitzhak shamir who then was foreign minister and two 
other cabinet ministers 
there was never a question of giving this sum to ministers or 
a political party and the only one who would have benefited from 
the deal would have been the israeli treasury the israeli news 
agency itim quoted rappaport as saying 
in washington independent counsel james mckay is investigating 
whether meese violated a law that prohibits payment of bribes to 
foreign officials by us companies and authorizes the attorney 
general to intervene to block them 
the investigation stems from a 1985 memo to meese from his 
longime friend e robert wallach who had been hired as legal 
counsel by rappaport to help secure us support for the pipeline 
project 
wallachs memo says payments were planned to the israeli labor 
party which peres leads in connection with the pipeline meese 
has said he does not recall reading the portion that mentioned 
payments to the party

a treaty requiring nations to prosecute or extradite 
terrorists who commit acts of violence on the high seas was signed 
by 23 countries thursday including the united states 
agreement comes more than two years after palestinian terrorists 
hijacked the italian cruise ship achille lauro and killed an 
american passenger 
representatives from 53 other nations including the soviet 
union israel egypt and libya expressed approval of the document 
the first maritime convention against terrorism 
i have a very vivid memory of the achille lauro and i can only 
feel the deepest emotion today said us ambassador maxwell 
rabb who signed for the united states this document corrects a 
tremendous void in the law of terrorism 
the treaty still must be formally ratified by the governments 
that signed 
a us government official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said he expected most of the 53 other countries would sign within a 
year he said many representatives wanted their governments to 
review the treaty before signing 
the palestine liberation organization sent observers to the 
treaty conference 
the treaty requires ratifying countries to make it a crime to 
commit violent acts against ships or the people aboard them it 
also covers oil rigs or platforms anchored to the bottom of the sea 
and the people aboard them 
the countries agree to either prosecute or extradite terrorists 
who commit violent acts at sea a country whose citizens are 
victims of an attack can seek extradition of the terrorists 
the treaty was the final document of a 10day conference of 
diplomats and international law specialists convened by the 
londonbased international maritime organization an agency of the 
united nations 
italy egypt and austria requested the convening of such a 
conference in 1986 following the achille lauro hijacking the ship 
was seized off egypt and many passengers were austrian 
the us government official said the treaty clarifies which 
countries have the criminal jurisdiction to prosecute people who 
commit acts of violence on vessels outside their territorial 
waters 
he said it fills a gap in international antiterrorist law 
in october 1985 four palestinian terrorists hijacked the 
achille lauro killing leon klinghoffer a 69yearold passenger 
from new york confined to a wheelchair at the time the united 
states accused italy of releasing mohammed abbas the accused 
mastermind of the hijacking who was later convicted in absentia by 
an italian court of the murder

a tobaccocompany representative who 
telephoned jurors during a 17 million liability suit against the 
makers of pall mall cigarettes did not break the law a district 
attorney said thursday 
were not sure of the specifics of the calls but in essence it 
was simply a case of trying to be friendly or trying to help even 
being a bit nosy frank carlton said in detailing the findings of 
a state investigation 
the investigation followed januarys trial of a suit brought 
against american brands inc by the family of nathan henry horton 
who died of lung cancer after smoking two packs a day of unfiltered 
pall malls for more than 30 years 
a mistrial was declared in the case when jurors couldnt agree 
on a verdict 
allegations of attempted jury tampering later surfaced and 
norman clark a jury consultant for the defense said he had called 
jurors at one point to inform them that the judge was sick and that 
the days session had been called off 
what occurred was improper but being improper is not a 
crime carlton said 
the truth is there is not supposed to be contact with jurors 
during trial for any reason even innocent contact can be 
misconstrued as it was in this case

iraq and iran said thursday they would 
stop rocketing each others cities but within hours both had 
launched new missile attacks 
iraq fired three longrange missiles at tehran on thursday and 
two into qom the iraqi news agency said the attacks brought to 51 
the number of missiles fired at tehran since feb 29 
irans official islamic republic news agency said iranian 
revolutionary guards fired two missiles into baghdad iran has 
reported firing 27 missiles into the iraqi capital since feb 29 
there was confusion over the timing of a possible ceasefire 
an iraqi statement broadcast over baghdad radio and monitored in 
nicosia said the bombardment of tehran and other iranian cities 
would halt by 4 pm friday if the iranians stopped firing at 
iraqs cities 
iranian prime minister hussein musavi said that iran would halt 
attacks on iraqi cities if iraq stopped attacking iranian cities 
tehran radio reported 
musavi said he was responding to a call by turkish prime 
minister turgut ozal who asked iran and iraq to stop the war of 
the cities by thursday at 5 pm 
ozal sent messages to iran and iraq on wednesday asking them to 
end the bombardments on population centers 
twenty diplomats and their families drove to turkey on wednesday 
night after evacuating tehran the independent turkish hurriyet 
news agency reported it said the group included diplomats from 
norway finland the netherlands denmark west germany and syria 
iraq claimed that tehran triggered the latest round of the war 
of the cities by hitting baghdad with two missiles feb 29 
so the last bombardment should be iraqs before the cessation 
goes into effect the statement said if the enemy iranian 
regime attacks any of our cities in retaliation for the last 
iraqi bombardment we will continue attacking 
the statement came after a meeting of top iraqi officials 
chaired by president saddam hussein 
iranian envoy mohammad jaafar mahallati told a news conference 
at the united nations that iran would honor any unconditional truce 
called for by secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar he said 
iran would not fire back if iraq got in the last shot before any 
deadline set by perez de cuellar 
we can respond to anyone but unconditionally 
unconditionally he said 
the un chief did not respond to mahallatis call sources 
close to perez de cuellar said iran also insisted he condemn iraq 
for starting the missile duel something he was unwilling to do 
irans islamic republic news agency said scores of civilians 
were killed or wounded in the latest iraqi missile attacks 
in the event of a complete halt to the air and missile attacks 
by the iraqi regime we too will stop these attacks musavi told 
the staterun radio 
but if the rulers of iraq refrain from accepting this request 
by turkey we will strengthen the intensity of our retaliatory 
measures he said in the broadcast monitored by the british 
broadcasting corp 
musavi said his nation was eager to defeat iraq on the ground 
and to end attacks on civilians 
we believe that the war must take place chivalrously on the 
battlefields and that extending the hostilities to residential 
areas to victimize women and children signifies only the impotence 
of the party that started such a crime he said 
the allswiss international committee of the red cross called 
the missile exchange a very grave violation of international 
humanitarian law a statement issued in geneva said the icrc made a 
solemn appeal to end what it called this tragic escalation 
of the war 
the official iraq news agency said a number of civilians 
were killed thursday in iranian shelling 
iran said its warplanes attacked basra and alamarah farther 
north 
cities in western or central iran reported hit by iraqi 
warplanes on thursday included isfahan hamadan arak dezful 
shustar shahre kord and burujerd a mosque and a school were hit 
in isfahan and two schools and a hospital were destroyed in 
shahrkord tehran radio said iraq reported its planes also raided 
khorramabad guilanegharb and sarepolzahab

a jury thursday convicted a man of murder 
and arson in a grisly crime spree that left five people dead a 
verdict returned one day after a second jury in the rare dual 
trial convicted a codefendant 
one jury was selected for each defendant at the trial to save 
time and to prevent the possibility of publicity from one trial 
tainting potential jurors for a second 
carl butch campbell 28 and robert ahalt 42 were accused 
of beating three people to death in a bar in 1986 during a robbery 
then killing campbell and ahalts girlfriends the next day in the 
womens homes 
one of the women who was six months pregnant was sexually 
mutilated and forced to eat glass before she and her fetus died 
the bar and the womens homes were set afire 
it was only the second time in new york legal history that two 
juries have been called on to listen to one case and give two 
verdicts 
during the trial the defendants sat at the same table but the 
two juries sat on opposite sides of the courtroom one in a 
specially built jury box 
the juries and evidence were color coded the jury considering 
ahalts case wore blue lapel tags and campbells jury wore yellow 
tags 
most testimony involved both cases but when a witness was 
providing information that involved only one defendant the other 
jury was taken from the room the defendants testified in front of 
their own jury only 
campbell convicted thursday faces a sentence of 115 years to 
life in prison ahalt could receive up to 125 years to life 
sentencing was set for april 7 
each defendant was charged with three counts of arson five of 
intentional murder five of murder during the commission of a 
felony in this case robbery and one of murder during a sexual 
assault 
campbell was acquitted of a charge of murder during a robbery at 
the home of one of the women and both murder counts in the slaying 
of the woman at the other home ahalt was acquitted of murder 
during a sexual assault 
attorneys for both men had objected to the dual juries and said 
they would appeal the verdicts 
state supreme court justice donald mark had originally said that 
the verdicts would have to be delivered at the same time 
but four hours after the ahalt jury reached its decision 
wednesday night campbells attorney waived his clients right to 
have the verdicts announced simultaneously 
killed at dicks 43 lounge were the bars 75yearold coowner 
martha gruttadauria her sisterinlaw concetta amatore also 75 
and colin tuttle 56 a patron 
the next day dorreen grachus 28 and evelyn allen 38 were 
found slain in their homes a halfmile apart grachus campbells 
girlfriend was pregnant allen ahalts girlfriend was beaten to 
death police said 
firefighters found all five bodies during fires 
the first dual trial was held in 1984 in nassau county and 
involved two young men who were drag racing and were charged with 
criminally negligent homicide when their cars slammed into another 
car killing the driver 
that case has been appealed to the states highest court 
largely because of the dual trial format said bruce whitney a 
nassau county assistant district attorney

a former minister left two telephone messages for 
his wife the night she was choked nearly to death describing his 
whereabouts in keen detail and giving times and warning her to 
lock the garage door according to tapes released thursday 
walker railey told police he found 39yearold margaret 
peggy railey unconscious on the floor of the garage at their 
lake highlands home shortly after midnight last april 22 choked 
with a cord she remains in a coma 
railey 40 senior pastor of the prominent united methodist 
church of dallas at the time of the attack claimed his family was 
the victim of a racially motivated attack after a suicide attempt 
and reported refusal to testify before a grand jury he resigned 
and moved to san francisco leaving his children ages 2 and 5 and 
wife in texas 
railey has denied attacking his wife and vows he is innocent he 
has not been charged but his lawyer said he was a prime suspect 
and police hope to have railey answer more questions 
prosecutors released the answeringmachine messages for the 
first time thursday 
if you want to go ahead and lock the garage door and ill 
park out front railey said on the tape it really doesnt 
matter to me at this point my concern is that youre safe 
one of the biggest discrepancies with the tapes is the time 
element in the first message railey told his wife he didnt have 
his watch on but thought it was about 1030 pm 
telephone company records however indicate he placed the call 
at 1204 am dallas county assistant district attorney norman 
kinne said thursday 
in the first message which lasted more than 1 minutes railey 
told his wife twice to lock the door and described his stepbystep 
trail conducting research at two southern methodist university 
libraries 
he explained that he had to leave one library when it closed and 
was on his way to another and later called to explain that he was 
on his way home 
im not calling on the private line because i know youre 
already asleep he said in the message saying he was on his way 
home but in case you get up with the kids i just wanted you to 
know that im on my way home its 1230 ill be home by about 
1245 love you dear bye bye 
after waffling on the time in his first message railey noted 
without hesitation in the second that the time was 1229 am a 
figure kinne said was confirmed to the minute by telephone company 
records 
he told police he arrived home at 1240 am and found his wife 
unconscious 
kinne initially refused to release the tapes prompting abc news 
to file suit the networks suit failed but kinne he decided to 
release the material after an appeals court ruled it was up to 
local officials to decide the issue 
the attack occurred after railey appeared at an easter service 
in a bulletproof vest claiming racially motivated death threats 
had been made against him and his family because of his procivil 
rights stands 
he produced typed letters that threatened his life but police 
traced them to a typewriter in his church the day police were 
scheduled to question him further he attempted to commit suicide 
and left a note saying demons were torturing him 
railey became less cooperative eventually appearing before a 
grand jury last july when he reportedly cited his 5th amendment 
rights against selfincrimination 43 times 
mrs raileys mother and legal guardian billie jo nicolai 
filed a civil suit accusing railey of the crime he has not yet 
responded to that lawsuit and must do so by monday 
railey moved to san francisco late last year and signed a years 
lease for an apartment with dallas psychologist lucy papillon 
that apartments telephone number is unlisted and the 
associated press could not reach him for comment thursday 
ms papillon has reportedly told grand jurors that she and 
railey were having an affair and that he was with her at her home 
during part of the evening when mrs railey was attacked 
railey gave temporary legal custody of his children to a 
minister at the church where railey served

eastern airlines inc was held in contempt of 
court thursday for taking steps to sell its eastern air shuttle to 
its parent company texas air corp for 225 million 
us district judge john h pratt ruled that the financially 
troubled miamibased airline had flouted his july 2 1987 
injunction directing eastern to maintain the status quo under its 
contract with a union that represents 12000 employees of the 
airline 
the preliminary injunction was issued in an different case last 
summer after the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers aflcio challenged easterns plans to transfer 
ground crews and baggage handlers to a new subsidiary called air 
ground services inc 
at the time pratt ruled the proposed transfer of 6000 iam 
members to the new subsidiary could not take place unless eastern 
bargained with the union 
in thursdays opinion pratt said the easterns financial 
troubles do not change the fact that it proposed a spin off of 
the air shuttle in clear violation of our july 2 1987 order 
which whatever doubts eastern had as to its meaning and 
application it made no attempt to have clarified or modified 
the judge noted that eastern announced the deal a day after it 
dropped its appeal of the preliminary injunction 
pratt scheduled a march 18 hearing to determine what sanctions 
should be imposed against the airline 
the courts order today sends a message to texas air that it 
is not above the law and it too must comply with the railway labor 
act the union said in a statement from its district 100 
headquarters in miami 
an airline spokesman robin matell said easterns view is 
that the courts ruling is incorrect and we intend to file an 
expedited appeal we are confident the court will rule in our 
favor 
pratt agreed with the unions claim that steps taken last month 
toward the sale of eastern air shuttle which operates between 
boston new york and washington to texas air amounted to a change 
in the status quo of the machinists working conditions and 
therefore violated the injunction 
the sale was announced last month pending federal aviation 
administration approval which is not expected for at least another 
month 
we find that the proposed spin off of easterns air shuttle 
operations is not fundamentally different from the proposed 
spin off of easterns fleet services employees to air ground 
services that was barred last summer the judge said 
the judge also determined that the proposed transfer to texas 
air significantly changes the working conditions of iam members 
and is therefore a major dispute under the railway labor act 
the judge accepted the unions contention that spinning off the 
air shuttle could undermine the machinists bargaining position 
with the company if less than 50 percent of the spin off companys 
employees opt to join the iam machinists who transferred to the 
new subsidiary from eastern would be without union representation 
the judge noted 
since texas air would be in control of the air shuttle 
operations including its labor policy it will control the 
hiring the judge said it can thus manipulate the composition 
of its employees and alone determine whether such employees will 
qualify for union representation

the reagan administration thursday appealed a 
federal judges order declaring unconstitutional regulations that 
would have cut off federal funding to family planning clinics that 
offer abortion counseling 
the administration filed notice it was asking the 1st us 
circuit court of appeals to overturn the march 3 ruling no date 
was set for arguments 
the ruling by us district judge walter jay skinner was 
announced the day the regulations were to take effect in response 
the administration ordered health and human services offices 
nationwide not to enforce the regulations 
the rules would have prevented federally funded family planning 
programs from providing abortion counseling abortion referrals 
and engaging in lobbying or legal action to increase availability 
of abortions 
if the clinic also performed abortions it would have to 
maintain separate facilities for those patients if it wanted to 
continue to receive federal funding under a provision of the public 
health service act of 1970 
skinner said the regulations violated a womans rights to 
privacy and to choose an abortion abortion referral and abortion 
counseling are constitutionally protected speech under the first 
amendment he said 
about 5 million low and moderateincome women receive services 
at the 4000 clinics nationwide that would have been affected by 
the regulations announced in february by hhs secretary otis r 
bowen 
federal judges in colorado and new york had issued temporary 
injunctions against the regulations but skinner was the first to 
rule on their constitutionality 
he ruled on an injunction requested by the massachusetts the 
national family planning and reproductive health association and 13 
other local and national family planning groups

diseases that now kill or cripple 
millions of children probably will be wiped out by the end of the 
century a leading american health expert said thursday 
the news on child survival is very good said dr william 
foege head of the task force for child survival and former 
director of the centers for disease control in atlanta 
by the end of the century we hope that measles will be reduced 
by 90 percent and that measle deaths which are now over 2 million 
a year will be reduced by 95 percent 
measles was just one aspect of the optimistic vision foege 
presented to some of the worlds leading experts on children 
health and third world development 
attending the meeting are barber conable president of the world 
bank james p grant director of unicef the un childrens fund 
halfdan mahler head of the world health organization leaders of 
more than a dozen other international aid agencies doctors and 
health ministers from 11 developing countries 
they will review a project that already is saving millions of 
lives and plan other efforts for the remainder of the century 
the threeday symposium at a 16thcentury former monastery on 
the shores of lake annecy is sponsored by the task force for child 
survival whose members are unicef the world health organization 
the world bank the un development program and the rockefeller 
foundation 
since the early 1980s the organizations have been working 
together on an international campaign to immunize children against 
polio diphtheria whooping cough tuberculosis and tetanus the 
project aimed particularly at developing countries has been a 
great success 
chinese officials said they believe 85 percent of chinas 110 
million children under age 7 will be vaccinated by the end of this 
year 
the number of the worlds children vaccinated against the five 
diseases has risen from 5 percent in 1974 to 50 percent today 
experts attending the conference say predict virtually every child 
in the world will be immunized by the early 1990s 
in a little over a decade a public health revolution has 
quietly taken place said dr ralph h henderson director of the 
expanded who immunization program 
he said the vaccination campaign against measles neonatal 
tetanus tuberculosis and whooping cough is saving the lives of 
more than 1 million children a year in poor countries another 
200000 children are being saved from the paralysis of polio 
henderson said 
dr ken warren of the rockefeller foundation called the project 
the single most remarkable example of international interagency 
cooperation ive ever seen 
the task force took as its model a campaign against smallpox 
begun in 1966 in october 1978 the world was declared free of the 
disease 
henderson said eradication of polio in the americas by 1990 is 
achievable and foege said experience gained in the next two years 
in the americas will allow the task force to set a reasonable 
date for eliminating polio from the world 
polio already has been overcome in the united states although 
cases sometimes are reported among immigrant groups 
a world without polio would be a fitting gift from the 20th to 
the 21st century henderson said

sen bob dole said thursday he would not drop 
out of the republican presidential race but confirmed that he had 
canceled all television advertising in advance of next tuesdays 
critical illinois primary he also ordered deep layoffs in his 
campaign staff 
even as dole issued a statement saying he was no dropout 
campaign aides said dole had discussed abandoning his presidential 
bid the kansas senators campaign was gravely weakened by vice 
president george bushs sweep of 16 primaries on super tuesday 
one aide speaking on condition of anonymity said doles 
private polls showed bush with a lead of between 15 and 20 
percentage points in illinois reflecting a significant jump for 
the vice president in the 48 hours since bushs stunning showing in 
this weeks primries 
an abc news poll released thursday night suggested bush led dole 
in illinois by a wide margin 58 percent to 31 percent 
in his statement dole did not say explicitly whether he would 
stay in the race if he lost illinois next tuesday one aide said 
i think its clear to dole that its do or die 
several campaign sources said dole met with campaign manager 
bill brock and other aides over the last few days in illinois and 
discussed the possibility of quitting the race in the wake of 
bushs commanding lead in the race for national convention 
delegates 
but dole decided to stay in 
in his statement issued in washington and illinois dole 
categorically denied rumors that he would quit 
bob doles no dropout im in this one to win he said 
in his statement dole confirmed the sweeping staff cutbacks 
but said they were sparked by the fact that the campaign no longer 
needed to run in so many states at once 
dole said no cuts were involved in states with primaries after 
next tuesday 
doles statement also confirmed he had ordered his television 
ads shut down in illinois but one source said the campaign may air 
a 30minute paid broadcast in the closing hours of the illinois 
campaign 
in the meantime dole took another shot at bush 
he said if the vice president still refuses to meet him in a 
series of oneonone debates they should agree to backtoback 
live onehour press conferences staged before the illinois primary 
the people of illinois and america have a right to see where 
george bush and bob dole stand on the issues he said in his 
statement 
bush campaigning in illinois was asked about the reports of 
dole considering withdrawal 
i just heard that i dont know anything about it he told 
reporters in champaign ill 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said the vice president was 
aware of the reports that dole was talking with aides abut whether 
to continue his campaign he said bushs reaction was well go 
about our business do our job 
earlier campaign spokeswoman dale tate said more than half the 
dole campaigns 300 staffers were being laid off many were still 
getting the word thursday evening 
dole continued campaigning thursday in illinois at one point he 
obliquely addressed the possibility of dropping out saying ive 
been in this business long enough to know that there comes a time 
you have to say well maybe it would happen 
tate declined to say who among the national staff was being let 
go 
it is significant it ranges from the top to the bottom in 
every department she said of the cutback 
some of the layoffs had been planned for the period following 
super tuesday regardless of its outcome she said she said the 
key members of doles traveling staff would be unaffected by the 
cutbacks naming press secretary mari maseng adviser thomas rath 
campaign chairman william brock and consultant kim wells 
tate said the campaign would keep a full complement of staff 
in illinois 
the developments came the same day that rep jack kemp abandoned

palestinians rioted near 
jewish enclaves and jews drove down arab streets early thursday 
firing at houses and savaging cars the army and witnesses said 
soldiers wounded three arabs 
troops shot and critically wounded two other arabs in the 
occupied gaza strip hospital officials said 
in a new leaflet issued thursday underground palestinian strike 
leaders told residents of the occupied territories to take revenge 
on jewish settlers palestinians who aid israel and those who 
sympathize with jordan 
leaflet no 10 signed by the plos united leadership of the 
uprising also ordered all arab policemen to resign and told 
palestinian merchants to boycott israeli products and reduce prices 
charged to arabs 
two alleged collaborators have been reported killed since arab 
riots began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza strip which israel 
captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war at 
least 87 palestinians have been killed by israeli gunfire or 
beatings and hundreds have been wounded 
police detained moussa and ali darwish who were free pending 
trial on charges of printing thousands of plo leaflets in east 
jerusalem israel radio reported 
jews in hebron a city of 50000 arabs with two small jewish 
enclaves said they were awakened shortly before midnight wednesday 
by arabs shouting slaughter the jews and god is great 
some settlers said they rushed into the street and fired warning 
shots because they feared attacks on their homes 
rabbi moshe levinger told the associated press the arabs ran 
down near the synagogue they wanted to enter jewish homes we 
responded by throwing stones and firing in the air if we hadnt 
stopped them there would have been a slaughter of jews men 
women and children 
noam arnon another resident of the 40family beit hadassah 
complex where levinger lives said arabs did not attack jewish 
homes 
there was no damage to jewish property he said adding that 
he believed militants from the kiryat arba settlement outside 
hebron were responsible for damaging arab property 
the area military commander also disputed levingers claim 
its important to stress that the riots were directed at the 
army and at no stage was there an intention or attempt to attack 
jewish homes the commander who did not give his name said on 
israel radio 
on may 2 1980 arab guerrillas fired on jewish settlers 
returning to beit hadassah after friday evening prayers six 
settlers were killed and 16 wounded by gunfire grenades and 
explosives in an ambush outside the building which had been 
occupied by jewish settlers from kiryat arba months earlier 
arab residents of hebron said they were awakened early thursday 
by carloads of settlers raiding their neighborhoods 
all the city was sleeping there was nobody in the streets 
said mustafa natsche the former mayor 
his cousin abdulrahman natsche said suddenly there was a 
sort of battle under the windows of my house shooting crying 
moaning the settlers demolished the cars of arabs and shot at the 
windows of homes 
an ap reporter saw seven vandalized cars including a station 
wagon with all its windows smashed and another gutted by fire the 
cars were in four divergent locations some more than a mile from 
any jewish settlement 
the owner of the burnedout car khader kafishei reported 
seeing a jew set it ablaze and pointed to bullet holes in the 
windows of his home 
arab residents showed several revolver cartridges they said were 
collected after the raids and said they turned over hundreds of 
casings to israeli authorities as evidence 
levinger claimed 500 arabs were rioting and came to within 100 
yards of jewish homes he said about 50 settlers defended the homes 
an ap reporter saw no apparent damage either to the stone facing 
of beit hadassah a former hospital or the other jewish enclave 
tel rumayda only a few hundred jews live in beit hadassah and tel 
rumayda 
army spokesmen said 20 to 30 arabs were involved in each of 
three disturbances in hebron and jewish settlers set one arab car 
ablaze soldiers wounded three palestinians in the legs when 
rioters trapped their jeep the army said 
soldiers surrounded the walled campus of hebron university 
where dozens of students barricaded themselves inside for two 
hours chanting antiisraeli slogans and waving posters demanding a 
palestinian state witnesses said the students dispersed 
peacefully 
at the beach refugee camp in the gaza strip soldiers shot and 
wounded two palestinians hospital officials said both were in 
critical condition with gunshot wounds in the chest and abdomen 
said the spokesmen at gaza citys shifa hospital

republican bob dole clobbered by vice president george bush in 
the super tuesday contests cut back staff and television 
advertising but insisted he was in this one to win despite 
polls putting him far behind in the illinois primary race bush 
said whatever happened his campaign would go about our business 
do our job 
bush meanwhile declared himself personally disturbed at the 
breaches of ethics hed seen in government and said thursday he 
would set up a white house ethics panel if elected president 
dole pulled television commercials off the air in illinois and 
laid off more than half his staff thursday and a source said his 
campaign advisers discussed whether dole should suspend campaigning 
before the illinis primary on tuesday 
an abc newswashington post poll published in fridays editions 
of the post indicated dole trailed bush in illinois 58 percent to 
31 percent 
however national campaign spokeswoman dale tate said dole 
intended to remain a candidate were not pulling the plug on the 
campaign she said 
later dole aides speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
possibility of dropping out was discussed but the kansas senator 
would keep campaigning at least through tuesdays illinois contest 
dole issued a statment thursday night denying he would withdraw 
bob dole is no dropout he said im in this one to win 
the dole developments came the same day that bushs super 
tuesday victories claimed another republican jack kemp and 
democrat gary hart was preparing to quit the democratic race 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller told reporters traveling 
with the vice president that on hearing reports about dole bushs 
reaction was well go about our business do our job 
democrat richard gephardt who ran a poor fourth among democrats 
on tuesday said michigan could decide his fate 
republican pat robertson who finished a distant third to bush 
and sen bob dole in the super tuesday contests said strange 
things happen in politics so i have no reason to get out 
however robertson campaigning in chicago said he planned to buy 
no television ads in illinois which has its primary next tuesday 
he said he expected to pick up a bit of support from 
conservatives who had backed kemp 
bush flew to illinois to press his campaign for the 82 gop 
delegates at stake in the states primary and he quickly took up a 
new issue saying he was tired of being embarrassed by scandals 
surrounding public officials though he named no names 
democrats michael dukakis jesse jackson and albert gore jr 
also campaigned in illinois for a share of the 173 delegates at 
stake in their partys primary there 
rep gephardt dmo who is focusing on michigan was joining 
the other hopefuls in chicago for a dinner and town meeting 
thursday night 
bush speaking about what he would do if elected president 
promised to create the ethics panel and also to set up a deficit 
summit with congressional leaders on day one of his 
administration 
when a congressman goes bad or someone in the executive branch 
violates the public trust it hurts bush told a governors club 
luncheon at the chicago hilton im tired of being embarrassed 
im tired of seeing our children seeing things that should 
embarrass us all people at all levels of government should come to 
serve not to profit 
clearly i have big plans he told the audience of 
republican boosters who sat silently throughout the speech 
kemp withdrew from the gop field after a string of third and 
fourthplace finishes in the early primaries and caucuses but the 
new york congressman hinted that he would be interested in the no 
2 spot on the ticket 
obviously you dont make plans to run for vice president 
kemp said at a capitol hill news conference but he called the idea 
a very flattering and awesome thought would i think about 
it the answer to that is yes 
kemp refused to endorse any of the remaining republican 
contenders theyre all reagan conservatives he said 
the embattled hart who polled no more than 5 percent of the 
vote in any of the super tuesday primaries and won no convention 
delegates planned to announce his withdrawal from the campaign at 
a news conference on friday in denver said sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the departure would mark the second time the onetime democratic 
frontrunner had quit the 1988 race hart withdrew last may after 
questions were raised about his relationship with model donna rice 
gephardt who also faired poorly on super tuesday issued an 
ultimatum to his own campaign michigan or bust 
if we dont do well here obviously we arent going to be able 
to continue in this race the missouri congressman said before a 
rally in lansing our real thrust our real force is going to be 
in michigan which has its caucus on march 26 
the gephardt campaign plans to shore up its forces in michigan 
with as many as 70 paid staffers who are scheduled to arrive by 
next week in comparison the campaign has about 20 paid staffers 
in illinois 
gephardt bristled at suggestions that his candidacy would suffer 
the same fate as kemps 
unlike jack kemp i have been in the middle of this race from 
the beginning he said i have a delegate count that is within 
striking distance of being back in the leadership 
dole who failed to capture any super tuesday states from bush 
focused on the vice presidents chances of winning in november 
against any of the democratic candidates 
my view is its going to be a very tough tough race for 
george bush dole said in chicago he does not attract 
democrats or independents 
i would be a much stronger candidate thats the message were 
going to try to make in the next couple of days he said 
gore also questioned whether his partys frontrunner 
massachusetts gov dukakis could defeat the republican nominee in 
november 
the people want a president who understands its necessary to 
fight for working men and women not a technocratic manager gore 
said as he greeted commuters at a downtown chicago mass transit 
stop for those who want another election blowout and see the 
democratic party losing 49 of 50 states vote for mike dukakis 
jackson who is expected to do well in illinois challenged 
voters in wheaton to continue his super tuesday success 
a generation must dare to hope jackson told students at 
wheaton college super tuesday has come and gone we were no 1 
or no 2 in 17 states lots of gold and silver medals the 
people responded 
jackson and dukakis were favored to pick up some of the 12 
delegates at stake in alaska which held caucuses thursday night

the stock market crash of last october 
obliterated faith in the usual economic forecasting tools leaving 
forecasters thrashing about in the debris 
theyre still at it wondering if the economic signals mean what 
they used to mean does a red light mean stop or could it 
possibly mean go 
the usual tools and instruments such as the index of leading 
economic indicators proved of little value in foretelling the 
earthquake in securities markets and so the question now is 
whether they can be relied upon at all 
immediately after the crash almost every popular forecaster went 
with his or her emotions and lowered estimates for economic 
activity it was a safe bet they reasoned because crashes always 
led to recessions 
the recession didnt come however impossible to comprehend 
then and still hard to believe socalled consumer confidence 
appeared not to be as badly damaged as they had thought people 
still bought companies still hired 
gradually the forecasters became brave again before the end of 
the year the mass of them had raised their estimates again not as 
high as before but enough to push the likelihood of recession 
further back into 1988 
they were on safe ground because such forecasts werent 
forecasts at all but recognition of what already had occurred car 
sales were strong people continued to take out credit and consumer 
confidence had resumed rising 
by january the evidence was sufficient for most of the breed to 
stick their necks out and declare that the chances of recession 
were growing remote still they said it would be a very dull 
economy in 1988 with little expansion 
no sooner had they braved the fates and showed their courage 
than they were shocked again having recovered from their own 
shock economic historians declared in retrospect that the fourth 
quarter had been stronger than realized 
now the sturdy crew of forecasters was confronted with a 
dilemma if the economy was stronger than had been realized before 
perhaps it might be stronger in the future than had been forecast 
who could be certain 
indeed nobody could be certain what could you believe if you 
couldnt believe the measurements of what had occurred in the past 
you really couldnt understand the present and that left you 
without a stick to measure the future 
in such a predicament it is a wise forecaster who uses both 
hands one to point gamely to the future and the other to wave a 
warning that if on the other hand it was a time for hedging 
the hedge was this the economy would grow but sluggishly the 
consumer would spend but cautiously couples would buy homes but 
carefully cars would sell but slowly credit would expand but 
barely 
now the hedge needs clipping 
there are signs the economy is expanding smartly as indicated 
by a surge in job creation and a jobless rate that fell in february 
to just 57 percent the lowest since july 1979 the use of credit 
is strong car sales rose so sharply in late february that even 
manufacturers and dealers were surprised 
the evidence of economic strength piling up recently makes it 
necessary for forecasters to forecast more often just to keep 
their revisions ahead of the event 
meanwhile deep in the privacy of their own minds it seems safe 
to say there is a gnawing uncertainty among economic forecasters 
regarding their powers 
among the public it seems just as safe to say there is 
conviction rather than uncertainty they are certain that the 
forecasters uncertainty is fully justified

as he stripped and cleaned the ak47 
assault rifle on his desk federal judge miguel angel izaguirre 
said he has good reason to try to stop latin american cocaine from 
reaching the streets of the united states 
in 20 years the youth that is taking all this cocaine will be 
running america and influencing latin america with the mentality 
of cokeheads he said north americas influence in this region 
is tremendous so we latin americans have to try to ensure that 
american youth does not take cocaine 
the 41yearold izaguirre is the federal judge in this caribbean 
coastal town he also is a weapons buff and student of military 
history 
men like arms are proven on the field of battle he said 
in an interview in his cramped and cluttered office that also 
contained an uzi submachine gun and this is my field of battle 
he has survived two attempts on his life he said one with an 
incendiary bomb the other a machinegun attack on his home during 
which he returned fire with his sovietmade ak47 
i love the ak he said his arsenal of weapons he 
explained is to defend myself against the medellin cartel 
the medellin cartel named for the city in colombia where it is 
based is believed responsible for more than 80 percent of the 
cocaine smuggled into the united states 
they have tried to bribe me with money women airplanes and 
yachts he said 
leaning against the wall were five segments of hollowed out 
honduran redwood ostensibly intended for assembly into rustic 
doors they are evidence from the biggest drug bust in us history 
the confiscation in november of four tons of cocaine by us 
federal agents in florida the drug shipped from the northern 
honduran coast was hidden in the hollows 
according to our information the shipment was 8000 kilos 
almost 9 tons so more than half of it got through he said 
us authorities were greatly concerned when over the past few 
years honduras became an increasingly important transshipment 
point for colombian cocaine 
izaguirre has been cited as a key man in joint ushonduran 
efforts to reduce the flow 
the judge said honduras with its long and relatively unguarded 
coast and scores of clandestine air strips provided the ideal 
midpoint for northbound shipments 
when i came here in june 1987 i found a series of cases all 
of which were being dismissed for lack of evidence other 
judges had certain fears some got sick some left he said but 
within two months he had handed down the first conviction and 
prison term for cocaine trafficking in honduran judicial history 
he has convicted 10 others on drug charges and has nearly three 
dozen suspected traffickers in jail awaiting judgment two major 
traffickers based here the colombian luis guerrero and the 
cubanamerican rafael gonzalez were extradited to the united 
states after being arraigned by izaguirre they are both serving 
terms in us prisons 
izaguirre said he has given the maximum penalty under honduran 
law to all the drug traffickers he has convicted five years in 
prison and a 5000 lempira 2500 fine he complains however 
that the law is too lenient and would like to see penalties 
increased he said the law provides the same penalties for cocaine 
trafficking as it does for marijuana trafficking 
the judge divorced four times and the father of five children 
carries his weapons with him wherever he goes 
if it befalls me to die in this post then ill die without 
the slightest fear he said

in hopes of making greeks more familiar 
with their ancestors ideas the education minister has ordered 
high school students to start taking daily classes in ancient greek 
in september 
the decision by education minister antonis tritsis was reached 
after months of public debate by scholars and educators but some 
teachers claim the language used by homer plato and the great 
greek dramatists might confuse young students and be too hard for 
them to learn 
ancient greek ideas should have a living medium in the world 
today tritsis said in an interview and i think that living 
medium is the greek people who continue to speak the same language 
as the ancient greeks 
he added that high school students 13 to 18 years old will be 
the first to take compulsory ancient greek but that eventually 
6yearolds will start learning the language through wordgames 
we want every young greek to be directly familiar with the 
great wealth of his ancestors and those ancient greek works that 
have influenced the world said tritsis an americantrained 
architect 
european literature began with homers poems about the legendary 
greek heroes of the trojan war the iliad and the odyssey 
plays by aeschylus sophocles and euripides in the 5th century 
bc are studied and performed in translation all over the world 
platos philosophic dialogues and thucydides histories contain 
ideas that shaped western thinking for centuries 
although greek classical scholars and university professors say 
they welcome tritsis project schoolteachers protest that ancient 
greek is too difficult for all but the most talented linguists 
while ancient greek shares an alphabet and a wide range of 
vocabulary with the presentday language its grammar and structure 
are much more complex 
it is a fallacy that ancient greek can be easily grasped by 
every schoolchild christos doukas who heads the athensbased 
high school teachers union said in an interview 
but tritsis said greek is a very conservative language he 
indicated it would be much less difficult for greek students to 
learn ancient greek than it would be for american high school 
students to learn old english which was spoken in england from 
around 400 to 1100 ad or even the english of chaucer and 
shakespeare 
the difference in language between shakespeares english and 
modern english or chaucer and modern english is greater than that 
between homer and heroditus and the greek spoken today he said 
despite changes in forms the vast amount of words and 
expressions are the very same language we use today 
junior high students now study ancient greek literature during 
four 45minute classes a week but they read texts that have been 
translated into modern greek 
tritsis wants students to begin reading the texts in ancient 
greek 
high school students take a twoyear basic course in ancient 
greek and read some of the original literature however they are 
not examined on the ancient greek texts tritsis wants those 
studies continued at a higher level entirely in the original greek 
the students will continue their usual studies of modern greek 
and their two classes a week of either french or english 
the teachers however argue that language lessons should focus 
on modern greek which a difficult language to master but still 
easier than ancient greek 
learning ancient greek from original texts will only confuse 
schoolchildren said doukas of the teachers union instead we 
should all spend more time and energy concentrating on the greek we 
speak today itself a rich and expressive language 
in a major reform of the greek school system in 1976 compulsory 
ancient greek was dropped from the state high school curriculum as 
a dead language irrelevant to modern educational needs 
now 15 and 16yearold students intending to go to university 
usually take a twoyear basic course in ancient greek but scholars 
say that isnt enough to keep the heritage alive 
ancient greek has to be introduced at a much earlier stage in 
a childs education when it helps to develop his imagination 
judgment and memory said constantine trypanis a former culture 
minister and retired oxford university professor of byzantine and 
modern greek studies 
the study of ancient greek language and literature in the 
original is of cardinal importance if that tradition of culture is 
to survive

economics and the irs may be undoing an idea 
hailed as a possible antidote to rising college costs tuition 
prepayment plans 
when duquesne university in pittsburgh pioneered such a plan in 
1985 it seemed a natural at a time of soaring tuitions families 
could buy higher education futures contracts the idea was that 
parents would pay a lump sum less if their child was young more 
if older and investments by the college would swell those funds 
to cover tuition costs down the road 
at duquesne for example the family of a 1yearold eligible 
for college in the year 2005 could have paid a lump sum of 8630 
last fall to cover the projected fouryear tuition of 102604 but 
a family of a 12yearold hoping to enroll at duquesne in 1994 
would have had to put up 19410 to cover the projected fouryear 
tuition of 48747 
so far so good parents purchase peace of mind at a discount 
knowing the plan guarantees four years of college as long as their 
child is accepted the school in turn gets a virtual lock on a 
future student hedging against future enrollment declines 
but it hasnt worked smoothly for duquesne or the several other 
colleges that followed its example nor for the five states that 
have adopted tuition futures plans for public colleges since 1985 
duquesne announced last week it was recommending suspension of 
its program because of higherthanexpected tuition increases and 
lowerthananticipated earnings on investments the board of 
directors is scheduled to make a final decision march 17 
similar programs at the university of detroit and canisius 
college in buffalo ny are likewise at a standstill and not 
taking new applicants 
three of the five states that enacted tuition futures plans for 
public colleges tennessee indiana and michigan are in limbo 
because the internal revenue service has yet to rule on the tax 
status of investment earnings from those plans 
wilson fadely an irs spokesman in washington refused to 
comment on when such a ruling might be handed down 
people contact me and say they are interested said lawrence 
a jegen chairman of the board setting up indianas program 
they have a thirst for a regimented investment program so they 
know that if they put their money on the table their childrens or 
grandchildrens tuition will be guaranteed 
but jergen said the plan might not be operating july 1 as 
originally hoped because of difficulties in predicting future 
tuition levels and because of the pending irs ruling 
a statesponsored program that began last august at the 
university of wyoming is going strong and has signed up 332 future 
students florida officials say they hope to start accepting 
applicants next fall 
michigan officials remain confident they will eventually get 
their program off the ground despite the questions raised by 
duquesne and despite the fact that state law forbids them from 
accepting a single student until the irs rules 
well have no problem at all paying for the program out of 
public investments said richard cole higher education adviser 
to gov james blanchard 
duquesnes heart was in the right place but it appears their 
financial brains were in the wrong place said michigan treasurer 
robert bowman they couldnt even gauge their own tuition 
but prepayment programs have been controversial from the start 
a number of colleges fairleigh dickinson university in new 
jersey for one considered and rejected the idea because of the 
builtin risks and unpredictability 
keith briscoe president of buena vista college in storm lake 
iowa called the idea a gimmick that overlooks students best 
interests because it deprives them of the chance to select a 
school freely 
the national association of independent colleges and 
universities which represents about 1000 private institutions 
has likewise criticized them as inflexible 
even backers concede they are a highrisk gamble for both 
parents and schools 
a state or college offering the plan must accurately predict 
future tuition and investment trends for years ahead or risk 
losing money honoring its tuition guarantees 
parents for their part are gambling that their child will want 
to attend a given college and will qualify for admission if for 
any reaon the child doesnt attend the school in the prepayment 
plan refunds are often limited to the amount parents actually paid 
in that means parents stand to lose tens of thousands of dollars 
in investment income 
what happened at duquesne was exactly what so many states and 
private colleges had feared all along bond markets weakened last 
year and undercut the plans investment income tuitions went up 
more than anticipated by 795 percent instead of the predicted 6 
percent 
the result was that the 622 alumni families who had signed up 
found themselves with a far more generous bargain than duquesne 
ever intended or could afford 
duquesne may be unique or it may be the likely outcome for 
many of these programs theres just not enough history to 
determine the real viability of programs like this said ron 
gambill executive director of the tennessee student assistance 
corp the agency that will administer that states program once 
the irs rules 
some like richard anderson director of the federally funded 
forum for college financing at columbia teachers college believe 
duquesnes program must have been first and last a marketing 
tool a premeditated financial giveaway aimed at attracting 
future students 
its true we wanted to offer a program that was going to be 
attractive said duquesne spokeswoman ann rago however the 
changes in the economy were drastic we never said our program was 
forever we started our program to help people specifically alumni 
families it was not just a marketing a tool

if this had been another issue liberal sen 
howard metzenbaum and conservative sen james mcclure might have 
quietly hammered out differences between their rival bills to make 
certain that plastic pistols cant get through airport metal 
detectors 
but history has taught that a gun control engagement is never 
fought with silencers even in rare instances like this one when 
rival sponsors have identical goals stopping terrorists 
especially at airports 
so once again bitter enemies of past gun control struggles are 
following the usual rules of engagement highpowered lobbying 
fullpage advertisements fundraising appeals and doomsday 
rhetoric 
sparking the latest debate is a weapon not even on the market 
red eye arms of winter park fla says it has a patent for plastic 
weapons but wont start making handguns for at least two years 
and then only for military and police use 
we would never allow anyone to build an undetectable civilian 
handgun said company vice president dwight brunoehler 
metzenbaum dohio and mcclure ridaho have vastly different 
approaches to require that the guns be made detectable both would 
ban manufacture or importation of any guns that did not meet their 
standards 
metzenbaums bill would require a minimum weight of metal to 
ensure that an alarm would be triggered at todays magnetometer 
settings its target is not only future plastic guns but pintsize 
metal pistols that are not detected today 
the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms estimates 
there are three small metal guns that could get through most 
magnetometers now used the gun owners lobby estimates there are 
countless other models 
mcclures legislation targets plastic guns only and has no 
minimum metallic requirement however it would require that guns 
be detectable by either including some metal a serial number 
engraved or stamped on metal or a substance detectable by xray 
machines used for luggage 
using todays technology mcclures bill would require more 
sensitive magnetometer settings more alarms and therefore more 
airport passenger inconvenience some say gridlock 
brunoehler of red eye arms says his firm has developed a 
computer chip for plastic guns that would make the lower settings 
unnecessary the chip would emit a signal that would make it appear 
that an enormous amount of metal was passing through the machine 
he said 
federal aviation administration spokesman fred farrar said the 
faa is aware of the chip but believes it could be disabled by 
drilling a hole in it or even placing the weapon in a microwave 
oven 
while these are the technical points for debate a congressional 
gun fight often ranges far beyond the issues at hand and this one 
is no exception 
the principal gun owners lobby the national rifle association 
told its 28 million members in a fundraising letter last year 
that metzenbaums real goal is the first federal gun ban bill in 
america 
if sen metzenbaums bill passes the next thing will be some 
government official knocking at your door to weigh your guns for 
inspection said the nra which backs the mcclure bill 
to handgun control inc the most visible lobby for pistol 
regulation the issue is what the group calls the nras extremism 
copkiller bullets mailorder handguns machine gunshas the 
nra gone off the deep end says hci ads which have different 
police chiefs using those same words 
handgun control supports metzenbaum so do a dozen law 
enforcement organizations 
both sides are simply waving flags so believers will send 
money to handgun control inc and to the national rifle 
association says john aquilino a former nra official who now 
publishes his own gun owners newsletter theyre making 
advertising agencies very wealthy its flagwaving and 
fundraising 
the latest battle reflects new political realities that surfaced 
in 1986 then the major law enforcement organizations joined 
forces with handgun control advocates to fight nrabacked 
legislation to ease many restrictions of the 1968 gun control act 
the presence of uniformed policemen lobbying their local 
lawmakers began to neutralize some of the nras seemingly 
invincible clout 
nonetheless the gun lobby attained many of its goals two years 
ago with passage of the mcclurevolkmer act which changed a number 
of provisions of the 1968 law but the invigorated gun 
controlpolice alliance was able to retain as part of that fight 
a ban on interstate sales of handguns 
now the same coalition of police and gun control advocates is 
back on the detectability question but jerald r vaughn executive 
director of the international association of chiefs of police says 
of his fellow police lobbyists were still babes in the woods 
when it comes to the political process 
yet the nra has taken an unusual turn by backing mcclures 
bill the group normally opposes any legislation that could bring 
more restrictions on firearms 
only last may nra governmental affairs director james jay baker 
told a house panel the nra believes that the only workable 
approach to the detection problem is better security at airports 
he said attempts to dictate metallic content of firearms or 
chemical composition of nonmetallic components of firearms were 
unnecessary 
their position from day one has been there shall never be any 
law on guns said nt pete shields chairman of handgun 
control inc 
all of a sudden this issue of plastic handguns has made them 
compromise this whole concept i think they have come a long way 
but i think theyre trying to address it with smoke mcclures bill 
is impractical you would bottle up the airport 
baker said in an interview the nra has moved a long way on 
this issue we decided to take the bull by the horns and deal with 
the terms as framed by the other side if theyre interested in 
detectability it can be done with no interference with existing 
firearms 
metzenbaums most prominent senate ally is strom thurmond a 
conservative south carolina republican and ranking republican on 
the judiciary committee metzenbaum and thurmond tried to win 
passage of their legislation last december but it was tabled by a 
4742 vote 
metzenbaum in an interview called mcclures bill purely 
cosmetic 
mcclure also in an interview said he rejects any arbitrary 
metallic standard and called any potential inconvenience part of 
the price you pay for having secure airports

the lincoln town car long a bestseller at ford 
motor cos lincolnmercury division continues to confound the 
skeptics 
the body style originally introduced as the 1980 lincoln 
continental town car has had a stronger increase in sales since 
1983 than have european luxury cars according to a ford analyst 
after testdriving the 1988 signature series town car i can see 
why 
the auto a big heavy monster still with the basic design it 
had in the late 1970s practically drove itself although critics 
might note that for a price of nearly 28000 the car should do a 
lot of things 
i didnt have to remember to turn on the headlights they did 
that themselves sensing when outside light was low thanks to an 
auto lamp onoff system 
the headlights also switched from low to high beams 
automatically and turned themselves off when the ignition was 
turned off i didnt have to remember to lock the doors before i 
drove off 
the car has an automatic system that locks them once ignition is 
on all doors are closed the transmission is shifted through 
reverse and someone is in the driver seat 
i didnt even have to remember to switch the rearview mirror to 
ward off headlight glare from other vehicles the test car had the 
optional for 89 automatic dim daynight mirror that flipped to 
protect driver eyes from glare every time a vehicle approached the 
rear it flipped back to normal when no vehicle was close behind 
so all i had to do was get inside start up the car shift and 
step on the gas pedal away i went along with 4100 pounds of 
sheer automotive force 
if you want that size of car and that configuration rear drive 
big weight luxury domestic there arent many choices probably 
the town car or a cadillac said ford analyst ray windecker sales 
of town cars have increased 90 percent since 1983 while sales of 
all cadillac models have fallen 8 percent 
european luxury car sales also havent risen as fast as they 
have for town cars he said citing a 39 percent boost at 
mercedesbenz and 62 percent at bmw overall the us luxury car 
market is up 35 percent from 1983 he added 
town car sales in the 1987 model year totaled 136085 up from 
119180 in the 1986 model year windecker said 
the plant producing the big cars has been on overtime nearly 
every day the demand is that great he said 
however he added sales likely will decline a bit in the current 
model year because the plant is building a newly designed lincoln 
continental and work on those models is expected to curtail some 
town car production 
town car buyers are older with median age of 60 actually 53 
percent are over age 60 forty percent of buyers are retired and 
median income is 58000 a year ford said thirtyeight percent 
are at least college grads 
besides appreciating the many automatic features on the town 
car those buyers can enjoy standard heated outside side mirrors 
and lighted thermometer that tells the outside temperature theres 
an expansive interior no complaints about a cramped back seat 
here and carpet is 30ounce cut pile 
also part of the 219inchlong vehicle is a trunk that is huge 
even with a fullsized spare tire inside the hood where the 
mighty 5liter electronic fuelinjected v8 resides juts out 
front so far i nearly hit the back of another car at a stop sign 
before i realized i wasnt in one of those down sized vehicles with 
little hoods im used to 
i did find the interior cloth upholstery navy in the test car 
showed some spills and i couldnt slide in the seat rather i had 
to lift myself and settle in 
with so much weight and such a big engine coupled with automatic 
transmission fuel economy suffers with only 17 mpg listed for 
city driving a fill up can be costly one gas station visit left 
me 20 poorer 
and the car had a somewhat mushy suspension 
consumer reports said buyer surveys showed 198385 town cars 
ranked better than average in its trouble index and average in the 
1986 model year the last year available 
the town car continues to show what a big american car can be 
and likely will be for the foreseeable future 
despite talk that its just a matter of time before large 
reardrive american cars disappear from showrooms a ford official 
says the company plans on keeping the popular town car around for 
some time

on the fringes of the multiethnic empire that the 
communists seized from the czars minorities emboldened by mikhail 
s gorbachevs reforms are clamoring for a greater say in their 
future and challenging the dictates of moscow 
in recent weeks armenians by the tens of thousands have marched 
in the streets estonians have massed at a monument in their 
capital and police have locked lithuanian activists in their homes 
to keep them from marking the brief period lithuania was an 
independent country 
in the most dramatic incident some members of two neighboring 
nationalities in the southern caucasus republics have directed 
their hostility not at moscow but at each other 
a rancorous territorial dispute has caused bloodshed injuries 
and deaths involving the armenians and neighboring azeris and some 
fearful azeris natives of the azerbaijan republic have fled their 
homes 
the violence and the palpable swelling of nationalist feelings 
on the soviet periphery pose one of the greatest problems yet for 
general secretary gorbachevs kremlin which is trying to enact 
nationwide standards of discipline and efficiency but also to 
decentralize economic control 
events have also poignantly shown how much the soviet union far 
from being an ethnic melting pot is still the uneasy 
conglomeration of disparate peoples that was dubbed by one 
disapproving 19thcentury visitor to russia adolphe de custine as 
a prison of nations 
in the 70 years of soviet power the moscowbased communist 
party and government have viciously fought centrifugal forces they 
feared might split the country into its ethnic components and the 
current party program adopted in 1986 under gorbachev speaks of a 
single soviet people 
but the soviet union extends from central europe to the far east 
and is peopled by more than 100 ethnic strains and speaking 120 
different languages or dialects they range from the dominant 
russians who make up more than 40 percent of the population of 
2845 million to the aleuts a far northern tribe with fewer than 
500 members 
gorbachev has called the formulation of a comprehensive policy 
to ensure national unity while granting each ethnic group its own 
cultural and linguistic rights the most vital fundamental issue 
of our society 
the unique feature of our culture is that it is 
multiethnic gorbachev said in february nationalism in any 
form is blind attempts at selfisolation lead down a spiritual 
blind alley 
underlining the importance of working out a new policy on 
nationalities gorbachev said the central committee the communist 
partys policymaking body would hold a special plenary session to 
discuss the matter 
the day gorbachev made those remarks feb 18 demonstrations 
began in yerevan the armenian capital to protest the central 
committees refusal to permit the joining of the nagornokarabakh 
region part of azerbaijan since 1923 despite its largely armenian 
population to armenia itself 
the protests swelled with some witnesses claiming that more 
than 1 million people had taken to yerevans streets whatever the 
size the rallies were the largest unsanctioned gatherings in 
soviet history 
some in the crowd proclaimed that the future of the contested 
region that is smaller than the state of delaware will demonstrate 
how gorbachevs entire national reform program is to proceed 
karabakh is a test of perestroika gorbachevs reforms 
declared some of the banners carried by chanting and singing 
armenians 
although in theory and under the 1977 constitution all of the 
countrys nationalities are equal the russians and their slavic 
cousins the ukrainians and byelorussians have a firm hold on the 
actual levers of power 
the ruling politburo shows clearly the extent of slavic 
domination a dozen of its members including gorbachev are slavs 
while only one is not foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze a 
georgian 
despite official rhetoric lauding the equality of nations 
russian preeminence is even enshrined in the soviet national 
anthem whose first stanza begins an unbreakable union of free 
republics has been forged forever by great russia 
the 15 constituent soviet republics have been tightly controlled 
by moscow over the years but gorbachevs drive for greater citizen 
participation plus his campaign for glasnost or openness 
have stirred both hopes and doubts about how far moscow will allow 
ethnic minorities to go 
at the same time gorbachev has ignored the penchant of his 
predecessor leonid i brezhnev to let local elites run the 
economic and social affairs of their republics providing they 
adhered to the dictates of moscow 
it was the replacement by gorbachev of kazakhstans ethnic 
kazakh party chief by a russian that sparked two days of rioting in 
the central asian city of alma ata on dec 1718 1986 in which 
two people were killed and 200 injured 
the recent outbursts involving armenians and azeris may 
strengthen the hand of kremlin conservatives who think gorbachevs 
reforms undermine the traditional submission of distant 
nationalities to the central russian power structure 
the more candid exploration of the legacy of dictator josef v 
stalin promoted by orbachev has also brought calls from baltic 
activists to extend glasnost to cover the forced incorporation of 
latvia lithuania and estonia into the soviet union in 1940 
we want to raise the consciousness of people so they remember 
they have the right to be free said the lithuanian activist 
jadvyga beliauskiene last month as police prevented activists from 
publicly marking the 70th anniversary feb 17 of lithuanias 
declaration of independence 
a group of estonians gathered in tallinn on feb 26 the 70th 
anniversary of estonias declaration of independence from soviet 
russia dissident sources in moscow said 2500 to 3000 people 
attended and official media confirmed the rally took place 
the contested region in azerbaijan shows in microcosm the 
problems faced by the kremlin on a national scale in formulating a 
nationalities policy that takes all pieces of the countrys human 
mosaic into account 
the small region is more than threequarters armenian but has 
residents of 48 other groups

campeau corp is renewing its attempt to block 
federated department stores incs poison pill takeover 
defense contending the plan wrongly denies federated shareholders 
the chance to choose between rival buyout offers 
campeau which is competing with rh macy amp co inc to acquire 
federated filed a brief tuesday in federal court to revive its 
request for an injunction against the plan 
the torontobased company called the rights plan a show 
stopper that would block campeaus 618 billion offer for 
federated 
the plan makes a hostile takeover attempt more expensive by 
allowing federated shareholders to buy more of the companys stock 
at a heavy discount 
campeau suspended its attack on the poison pill after the 
company appeared to be close to an acquisition agreement with 
federated in late february however when the federated board met 
to consider accepting campeaus offer on feb 29 it also began 
reviewing the macy bid 
macy which last week signed a 61 billion definitive buyout 
agreement with federated on tuesday began a tender offer for 
federateds common stock under the offer macy will pay 7450 per 
share in cash for approximately 80 percent of federateds stock 
macy plans to swap shares in a new company macysfederated inc 
for the remaining 20 percent of federateds shares 
analysts have valued the macy bid at 61 billion 
campeau is offering 75 in cash per share for 80 percent of 
federateds stock and 44 in cash per share for the remaining 20 
percent the campeau bid which has an aggregate value of 68 per 
share totals 618 billion 
macy also went to federal court tuesday seeking an injunction 
against the campeau bid macy contended the campeau offer which 
was amended from an earlier 68ashare outright cash bid actually 
was a new offer and under federal law must remain open past its 
march 15 scheduled expiration 
if the macy request is granted it effectively would put the 
campeau offer on a more equal footing with the macy bid which is 
scheduled to expire april 4 by reducing pressure on federated 
shareholders to make a choice 
under federal law a new offer would have to remain open for at 
least 20 business days after publication or submission to 
stockholders 
campeaus bid was announced march 2 if it is considered a new 
offer it could not legally expire on march 15 as scheduled 
federated the nations fifthlargest retailer owns department 
stores including bloomingdales lazarus richs abraham amp straus 
bullocks and burdines 
macy holdings include nearly 100 department and specialty stores 
and campeau a real estate developer owns allied stores corp

united artists communications inc and united 
cable television corp have agreed to combine their operations into 
a 38 billion concern that would rank as one of nations biggest 
cable companies 
the transaction disclosed wednesday and approved by the 
directors of both denverbased companies would create united 
artists entertainment co which would have interests in both cable 
television and motion picture theaters 
the two companies had agreed on an allstock merger shortly 
before the october stock market crash but canceled the deal soon 
after citing disagreement over the terms and uncertain market 
conditions 
they announced in january that they had resumed their 
discussions 
the new deal is subject to approval of the companies 
shareholders and federal regulators and favorable tax rulings 
among other conditions the companies said they said they hoped to 
complete the deal later this year

287 a share to 3262 in overthecounter trading united 
artists rose 225 a share to 2975 
the new company would have about 23 million cable subscribers 
by the end of the year said stewart d blair chairman and chief 
executive of united artists 
that would place the new concern behind only the two industry 
leaders in terms of subscribers telecommunications inc and 
american television and communications inc according to paul 
kagan associates a media research and investment concern in 
carmel calif 
telecommunications which also is based in denver currently 
owns 65 percent of united artists and 237 percent of united cable

the cash portion of the offer would be available on up to 49 
percent of united cables 464 million fully diluted shares 
william j elsner senior vice president and chief financial 
officer at united cable said the october agreement had been 
criticized for failing to include a cash alternative 
sharon armbrust a senior analyst for paul kagan associates

billion

several major newspapers are hoping that putting 
an island of advertising in their sea of stock tables will help 
attract more national advertisers to the medium 
the first ad buyer to participate in the unusual effort is 
national car rental system inc 
the minneapolisbased company said wednesday it would spend 2 
million through the end of the year to put quarterpage ads in what 
is being called a new island position on the first page of the 
stock table sections of 16 newspapers in the nations 20 biggest 
markets 
the ads which will be surrounded on four sides by stock 
quotations will appear a minimum of 26 times starting march 17 in 
each newspaper according to lewis carbone a national marketing 
executive 
a committee of the national advertising bureau a trade 
organization came up with the idea for the unusual ad position 
and along with nationals ad agency chiatday inc persuaded the 
16 newspapers to sell it 
michael davies head of the newspaper bureau panel and editor 
and publisher of the hartford courant said the committee looked at 
a dozen proposals for displaying advertising more distinctively 
before deciding on this approach 
he said the committee wanted to find a way to help an ad message 
stand out without disrupting normal reading patterns 
putting an ad in the stock tables seemed appropriate he said 
because people usually look for individual stock prices rather than 
reading through the entire section this doesnt interrupt the 
flow of reading a page he said 
but some big newspapers turned down the idea 
the new york times rejected it because it would make it too 
hard for the reader to get through the stock tables according to 
spokeswoman nancy nielsen 
the wall street journal also balked bernard t flanagan vice 
president for marketing said the placement would be an 
inconvenience to the reader in a sense we want to make it as 
easy as we can for readers to look up their stock quotes he said 
flanagan said the ad placement also takes prestige away from 
the page 
newspapers have seen their share of national advertising 
spending decline steadily in recent years as national advertisers 
turned to television 
newspapers took in 159 percent of total national ad spending in 
1950 but fell to below 6 percent in 1986 
last year national advertisers spent 35 billion in 
newspapers or about 58 percent of their total spending of 606 
billion according to an estimate by the ad agency mccannerickson 
inc 
but robert zach media director for chiatday said the rising 
cost of television time is making advertisers more receptive to 
alternative ways to reach customers 
davies said he expected other advertisers would take an interest 
in the new ad position and that other newspapers would embrace the 
idea 
the 16 newspapers that have sold the space to national include 
the atlanta journal and constitution chicago suntimes dallas 
morning news detroit free press hartford courant houston 
chronicle los angeles times miami herald minneapolis star and 
tribune phoenix gazette rocky mountain news san francisco

home mortgage rates fell at the quickest pace 
since 1986 early this year partly because of the broad decline in 
interest rates in the wake of the october stock market crash 
according to the government 
the stock market collapse also played a role in boosting net 
deposits at the nations savings institutions during january for 
the fourth straight month the federal home loan bank board 
reported wednesday 
effective rates on typical 30year fixedrate mortgages for 
singlefamily homes dropped to 105 percent in early february from 
1097 percent in early january rates on the most popular type of 
adjustable rate mortgages those with caps on how much the rate can 
change fell to 874 percent from 898 percent over the same period 
the decline in commitment rates is consistent with the 
softening of mortgage demand that generally occurs during the 
winter months said james barth the bank boards chief economist 
however the recent declines were the sharpest since 
1986and appear to have reflected mainly large deposit 
flowsafter the stock market collapseand an acrosstheboard 
decline in interest rates he said 
mortgage lending by sampls in january declined to the lowest level 
since february 1985 savings institutions lent 131 billion in 
mortgages down more than the usual seasonal dropoff from 217 
billion in december 
contributing to the reduced lending volume was a lingering 
skittishness on the part of potential home buyers following the 
oct 19 collapse in stock prices barth said in a statement 
the spread between fixedrate and adjustablerate mortgages 
narrowed to 176 percent the smallest difference since last 
spring the proportion of mortgages being closed with adjustable 
rates edged down from 65 percent in december to 63 percent a month 
later 
but the popularity of adjustablerate loans remains far higher 
than last spring when they represented 20 to 30 percent of the 
market 
a separate survey of mortgage rates by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp indicated 30year fixedrate mortgages averaged 
985 percent last friday down slightly from 987 percent a week 
earlier and sharply lower than 1061 percent on jan 1 this survey 
does not include addon fees known as points which are included 
in the bank boards averages 
the bank board also said net new deposits at the nations 3135 
federally insured sampls increased by 56 billion in january 
following a 26 billion increase in december that compared with 
net withdrawals of 21 billion in january a year ago 
barth said deposits normally increase from december to january 
but he added nearly half of the most recent improvement 
represented nonseasonal factors undoubtedly the precipitous 
decline in the stock market remains one of these factors 
nervous investors seeking a safe haven for their money 
increased deposits by 62 billion in october and 32 billion in 
november 
the last four months represent a sharp reversal of the trend in 
recent years which has been described as a slowmotion run on 
thrift institutions there were net withdrawals of 33 billion in 
1986 and 137 billion in the first nine months of 1987

the securities and exchange commission says 
new yorks antitakeover law is an unconstitutional impediment to 
interstate commerce 
the sec also contended wednesday that the statute conflicts with 
the williams act the 1968 federal law regulating corporate 
takeovers 
the agency made its arguments in a friendofthecourt brief 
filed in a suit brought by salant acquisition corp against 
manhattan industries inc one of the nations biggest makers of 
mens shirts and sportswear 
proliferation of state antitakeover laws since the supreme 
court upheld indianas takeover statute last year has heightened 
the issue of whether the federal or state governments should take 
the lead in regulating corporate takeovers 
the new york law prohibits a bidder who acquires more than 20 
percent of a companys stock from completing a takeover or other 
major business transaciton with the company for five years unless 
the bidder gets approval from the targets board of directors 
the statute gives corporate management virtual veto power over 
whether the company will be acquired sec general counsel daniel 
l goelzer wrote in the brief 
the law effectively preempts the williams act he argued 
goelzer said the structure and the legislative history of the 
williams act make it clear that congress believed thatit 
should be the shareholders the owners of the corporation who 
make the decision not the management 
the sec which regulates the nations securities markets is 
intervening in the case in us district court in manhattan on the 
side of salant 
salant a unit of salant corp another major apparel maker 
began a 95 million hostile takeover attempt of manhattan 
industries in february 
manhattan industries had sought to block the 16ashare buyout 
offer salant launched on feb 2 us district judge louis l 
stanton last week denied manhattan industries request for a court 
order blocking the tender offer but did not rule on salants 
constitutional challenge 
manhattan industries said wednesday it had entered into 
negotiations about a possible merger with salant 
the sec took a similar position when the supreme court 
considered a challenge to indianas antitakeover law last year 
but the court upheld the law 
in another current battle the sec has indicated it was 
considering whether to file briefs in suits challenging the newly 
enacted delaware antitakeover law which is structured somewhat 
similarly to new yorks law

matsushita electric industrial co ltd says 
it may export to japan some of the approximately 1 million 
largescreen color television picture tubes it will make each year 
in this western ohio city 
the 160 million matsushita plant is to open in spring 1989 with 
240 people and production of 400000 tubes company officials said 
wednesday 
that will expand to about 400 jobs once full production is 
reached in two or three years said fumio kanazwa president of the 
subsidiary matsushita electronics corp 
the company announced it planned to build a plant in troy last 
december but disclosed no details until wednesday 
kanazawa declined to specify under what conditions matsushita 
would export tubes to japan where matsushita already makes some 
largescreen tubes but said it would not depend just on the 
yendollar exchange rate 
the plant will make 29 and 33inch tubes although it could be 
reconfigured to produce smaller picture tubes said yasuhiko 
yamaguchi who will be president of american matsushita electronics 
corp 
production at troy will represent slightly more than 10 percent 
of the total picture tube production by matsushita which had total 
1987 revenue of more than 36 billion 
matsushita which makes panasonic quasar technics and national 
brand consumer electronics began producing televisions in the 
united states with acquisition of the quasar plant from motorola in 
1974 spokesman justin camerlengo said 
matsushita has been buying about onethird of its picture tubes 
in the united states he said 
honda of america on monday became the first japanese automaker 
to export to japan when it shipped off 540 accords made at its 
marysville plant 
honda the fourthlargest automaker in the united states plans 
to export 4000 accords to japan this year and 50000 usbuilt 
cars to japan annually by 1991

officers of usg corp are urging the building 
materials companys shareholders to reject a 19 billion hostile 
takeover offer as inadequate and coercive and say the company 
might sell a major stake to a third party 
usg chairman robert j day wrote shareholders wednesday that 
they should reject the unsolicited 42ashare tender offer by 
desert partners lp a group led by texas oilmen jack e brown and 
cyril wagner jr 
usg also disclosed in a securities and exchange commission 
filing that it may sell a substantial stake in usg to a third 
unidentified company 
placing a big block of shares in friendly hands a maneuver 
known as the white squire takeover defense would make it more 
difficult if not impossible for desert partners to acquire control 
of the company 
desert partners on march 1 launched a tender offer of 42 in 
cash for each of 215 million shares of usg stock the group also 
offered to acquire the balance of usgs 508 million outstanding 
shares with securities it valued at 42 a share desert partners 
already owns about 99 percent of usg stock 
day questioned the value of securities portion of desert 
partners offer saying it consisted of junk bonds and warrants 
purportedly worth 42 per share 
paul colitti a usg spokesman said the company believed the 
42pershare cash portion of the offer also did not reflect usgs 
true value 
usg stock fell 162 to 3650 a share wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange indicating investor doubts about the 
seriousness of desert partners offer 
desert partners responded to usgs decision late wednesday with 
a letter to the companys board saying it was prepared to negotiate 
its tender offer 
desert partners also chastised usg for considering selling a 
chunk of the company to a third party in what the texas group 
called an attempt to block its takeover bid 
we are certain that your stockholders would much prefer your 
entering into prompt goodfaith negotiations with us rather than 
your continuing to devote effort and expense to defensive tactics 
that can only erode the value of usg shares desert partners said 
in its letter 
colitti said usgs discussions with another party did not 
necessarily mean a deal was imminent 
desert partners bought its usg shares last year for about 4430 
a share in a previous takeover attempt that fizzled when the texas 
group was unable to arrange the necessary financing 
desert partners also is seeking shareholder purchase rights that 
take effect friday and that were triggered by the tender offer 
the purchase rights part of usgs poisonpill takeover 
defense would allow all shareholders except desert partners to buy 
additional new usg stock making completion of a takeover 
prohibitively expensive 
desert partners has filed a lawsuit in us district court in 
chicago challenging the legality of the poison pill and has said it 
will seek to elect six directors to usgs 15member board at the 
companys annual meeting in may 
usg based in chicago is a leading producer of gypsum and 
building materials with about 100 plants nationwide

below the 155 percent in january

services were among others with substantial increases

the list of american hightechnology goods 
china is allowed to buy will start expanding again because the 
reagan administration has determined the chinese are not selling 
silkworm missiles to iran 
china also says it wants a commodity the united states is 
sending to 64 other countries peace corps volunteers 
under an agreement announced wednesday at the conclusion of a 
threeday visit by chinese foreign minister wu xueqian the united 
states will lift a fivemonth suspension on liberalization of 
hightech products china is permitted to buy from american 
companies 
the restriction was imposed in october to protest what the 
united states said was sale of chinese silkworm missiles used by 
iran to attack neutral shipping in the persian gulf 
during his visit wu continued to deny that such sales were ever 
made directly by china without commenting on that assertion the 
administration said it was satisfied with what the chinese are 
doing now 
we are encouraged by chinese statements and actions regarding 
irans acquisition of chinese antiship missiles silkworms 
state department spokesman charles e redman said 
we have therefore decided to resume the export control 
liberalization process for china he said 
this means experts from the state commerce and defense 
departments will resume reviewing the list of hightechnology 
products now banned for sale to china to see if any items can be 
removed sales of hightechnology products cleared for chinese 
purchase before last october have been continuing 
among the technologies that could be cleared for export to china 
are computers electronic components communications gear and 
metallurgical processes 
the decision removed an irritant in the relationship clearly 
they werent happy about it but we werent happy about the 
silkworms said a reagan administration official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
wu also assured the united states that china would go along with 
a united nations resolution banning all arms sales to iran the 
us official said according to us estimates china sold nearly 
1 billion worth of arms to iran in 1987 
wu said at a national press club luncheon on wednesday that us 
officials showed how upset they were about the silkworms by raising 
the issue 20 times during the three days of talks 
he once again denied china ever sold weapons to iran but when 
asked if chinese weapons were getting to iran through other 
countries he said we have no idea 
he gave an upbeat assessment of relations and called for more 
trade and more peopletopeople contacts between chinese and 
americans then he revealed that after years of us requests 
china had agreed in principle to accept peace corps volunteers 
since the program began in 1961 under president kennedy many 
nations feelings about peace corps projects have reflected their 
overall view of relations with the united states 
in india for example the largest country to have had peace 
corps volunteers the welcome mat was put out in 1962 when ties 
were strong and was withdrawn in 1976 when relations soured there 
are now peace corps volunteers in 64 countries 
the program in china is likely to concentrate on english 
teaching but further discussions will be needed to determine how 
large the peace corps contingent will be and what it will do 
it will be good news for our country and i believe for the 
chinese people if the peace corps can send its volunteers to the 
most populous nation on earth said sen christopher dodd 
dconn who served as a volunteer in the dominican republic in the 
1960s we could learn much about each other 
rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on asia called the peace corps agreement a 
potentially important step 
i feel confident that these ambassadors for the american way 
of life will have a positive impact upon ties between the largest 
nation in the east and the largest nation in the west solarz 
said 
amid the good feeling they said was generated during the wu 
visit us officials had little comment on the issue of tibet 
where chinese authorities are clashing with groups seeking tibetan 
independence 
redman the state department spokesman said secretary of state 
george p shultz raised the issue of human rights in tibet but 
provided no details 
in his press club remarks wu denounced a proposal by the dalai 
lama the religious leader of tibetan buddhists who is living in 
exile in india the dalai lamas proposal includes a withdrawal of 
chinese troops from tibet 
wu said of the dalai lama he is an exile who attacks and 
smears the peoples republic of china

a fouryear dispute over allegations the army 
was fraudulently overcharged for helicopter spare parts has been 
resolved with bell helicopter textron inc agreeing to pay the 
government about 88 million the army said today 
the settlement one of the largest ever in a defense contracting 
case grew out of findings by pentagon auditors of numerous 
accounting and inventory irregularities at the fort worth texas 
company pentagon sources said wednesday night 
maj phil soucy an army spokesman today confirmed a settlement 
had been reached and was scheduled to be signed on friday a 
company statement said we believe a settlement is in the 
offing 
the army is fully satisfied with this settlement and believes 
it has recovered every dime out of this that we can get said 
soucy 
the pentagon sources said that in reaching the settlement 
federal prosecutors had agreed to drop any potential criminal or 
civil charges and that bell helicopter would not acknowledge any 
wrongdoing 
soucy agreed there would be no further prosecution in the case 
but said the government had always hoped to strike a reasonable 
settlement rather than go to trial because of the cases complexity 
this was a very complex case that turned on a bad accounting 
system at bell helicopter that was used in connection with 
contracts worth billions of dollars the spokesman said 
reached late wednesday carl harris a bell helicopter 
spokesman read from a prepared statement which acknowledged there 
had been settlement discussions 
we believe a settlement is in the offing the statement 
said we are hopeful it will be soon however we are not able to 
comment until a final agreement is reached the terms that are 
currently under discussion will not have a material effect on bell 
helicopter textron in 1988 
according to soucy the settlement will require bell helicopter 
to pay 69 million directly to the us treasury within the next 30 
days the company also will have to allow the army to assume 
possession of any or all of a spare parts inventory valued at about 
11 million 
in addition bell will forego claims to about 6 million worth 
of interest on contract progress payments withheld by the army and 
about 15 million in legal fees offsetting that will be a 11 
million payment by the army to bell to cover a separate contract 
that got sidelined in the dispute 
when a number of smaller provisions are added in the final 
value of this settlement is roughly 88 million soucy said 
the spokesman said most of the overcharges came as a result of 
an accounting problem that dealt with the handling of contracts 
between 1983 and 1985 during the period bell switched to a 
computerized accounting and inventory system that had the effect 
among other things of accelerating the companys requests for army 
progress payments for work performed 
bell agreed to implement a new accounting system that met the 
armys approval in october 1985 
the defense contract audit agency had originally identified 
about 107 million in overcharges by bell soucy said subsequent 
investigation uncovered a number of overlapping amounts and 
duplication in the books 
the overcharges never amounted to 107 million soucy said but 
he declined to estimate how much they did total 
soucy said the company had also agreed to implement a business 
ethics program for its employees and to acknowledge our right to 
audit their books and documents 
bell helicopter is a wholly owned subsidiary of textron inc a 
conglomerate based in providence ri in fiscal 1987 the parent 
company ranked as the pentagons 18th largest contractor with 
155 billion in defense work 
bell helicopter holds contracts from the army for such major 
helicopter programs as the ah1 cobra attack helicopter the uh1 
iroquois utility helicopter and the oh58d kiowa light helicopter 
a house committee is conducting its own investigation of the 
case

early contract talks between chrysler corp and 
the united auto workers union could help the company and its 
workers heal their recentlybattered relationship a labor expert 
said 
the fact that both sides appear to be pushing for it reflects 
a desire for some stability said harley shaiken a labor and 
technology expert at the university of california at san diego 
the uaws 140member national chrysler bargaining council 
representing 71700 workers at 49 local unions was to meet here 
today to decide whether to start talks as soon as next month 
uaw president owen bieber in detroit to attend a conference on 
aging work forces said he would urge the council to agree to early 
talks but he declined to comment on possible establishment of an 
earlier strike deadline to accompany early talks 
chryslers threeyear contract expires sept 14 talks usually 
begin in midsummer but chrysler asked to start negotiations after 
its failed attempt to sell its 28000worker acustar inc parts 
subsidiary 
the no 3 automaker last week canceled plans to sell acustar 
because of uaw opposition including threatened plantbyplant 
strikes that could have crippled production chrysler instead 
decided to sell or close four acustar plants within 18 months 
in response to the acustar proposal workers also stopped 
participating in unionmanagement programs critical to improving 
productivity and quality and have not returned because of 
unresolved conflicts with the company uaw leaders said 
uaw vice president marc stepp wanted the council to agree to 
early talks which local union leaders said wednesday could help 
prevent plant closures and movement of work by chrysler to outside 
companies or countries 
im positive our membership would be 100 percent in favor of 
that as long as were talking about jobs they would be more than 
willing said local 1264 official fred obrien at chryslers key 
sterling heights stamping plant 
shaiken said an early settlement also would help chrysler and 
its workers put the acustar conflict behind them and basically 
settle into a pattern for the next few years 
a key issue in the decision was whether chrysler also would 
accept an early strike deadline or insist on a target deadline 
without giving the union the right to strike if no settlement is 
reached 
uaw spokesman peter laarman said the union preferred to 
actually start the clock rather than simply set an artificial 
bargaining deadline 
chrysler chief negotiator anthony st john told the detroit news 
on tuesday that the company did not want an early strike deadline 
but the company would not comment wednesday 
chrysler eventually is expected to agree to the pattern contract 
established last fall at ford motor co and general motors corp 
that includes job protection not included in chryslers present 
contract 
the gm and ford contracts forbid layoffs except when production 
falls because of slow sales make it harder for the companies to 
move production outside the company or country and forbid plant 
closings that were not announced before talks started 
obrien said going to the table early would limit the time 
chrysler has to announce further plant closings and make it easier 
for the union to battle the possible closings of the four acustar 
plants 
chrysler buys the largest percentage of outside parts of any big 
three maker 70 percent compared with 30 percent at gm and about 
50 percent at ford and obrien said workers want to prevent 
further outsourcing 
stepp said he also wants the ford profitsharing formula in the 
next contract ford workers tuesday received profitsharing checks 
averaging more than 3700 from fords industryrecord 1987 profits 
of 46 billion 
chrysler has no profitsharing plan

united auto workers union members in 
kenosha wis have rented a billboard in this detroit enclave to 
ask chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca to keep their plant open 
and save their jobs 
chrysler has announced it will close the former american motors 
corp car assembly plant in kenosha at the end of the 1988 model 
year eliminating 5500 jobs chrysler acquired the plant when it 
bought amc last year 
the billboard located along interstate 75 in hamtramck says 
iacocca keep your word to kenosha uaw local 72 kenosha 
the uaw and wisconsin officials contend chrysler promised to 
modernize the plant and keep it open for five years of making dodge 
omni and plymouth horizon subcompacts chrysler denies it gave any 
guarantees 
we hope this will generate interest and motivate iacocca to 
change his mind said rudy kuzel spokesman for local 72 
the local paid 4200 for one months rent on the sign which is 
a few blocks from chrysler headquarters in highland park 
we will not crawl off in a corner kuzel said wednesday 
they want us to lie down play dead and wait to see how we are 
going to be buried 
top chrysler and uaw leaders met in milwaukee on wednesday to 
discuss the kenosha plant and benefits for workers should it close 
unlike other chrysler workers those at kenosha and other former 
amc plants arent covered by the supplemental unemployment benefits 
provision of the chrysleruaw contract

a federal appeals court today lifted a stay that 
had prevented the arbitrageur accused of threatening to kill ivan 
boesky from leaving federal detention and moving into a private 
psychiatric hospital 
the 2nd us court of appeals denied the governments motion for 
a continuation of a stay the effect is to allow john mulheren to 
be moved to the private hospital 
us district judge whitman knapp had ruled wednesday that a 
threehour examination by a courtappointed psychiatrist indicated 
that mulheren presented no threat to either himself or the 
community and released him from the metropolitan correctional 
center 
but assistant us attorney robert gage said he opposed 
releasing mulheren to the private hospital and obtained a ruling 
from the 2nd us court of appeals staying the matter until todays 
ruling 
the government had argued that the private facility the carrier 
foundation in montgomery township nj was not secure enough to 
house mulheren the senior partner at jamie securities co 
however knapp said hes no danger at the moment and if hes 
kept under proper surveillance theres no reason to believe he will 
become dangerous 
mulheren carrying a loaded assault rifle was arrested feb 18 
by the police outside his rumson nj home 
he is being held on a criminal complaint that he threatened to 
kill admitted insidertrader boesky and michael davidoff boeskys 
former head trader the men have reportedly implicated mulheren in 
possible securities law violations 
mulherens lawyers argue that he is a manic depressive who had 
failed to take his lithium a drug used to control impulses the 
day of his arrest 
knapp said he could not explain mulherens actions but agreed 
with the psychiatrist that they were an aberration 
one of his defense lawyers peter bennett said wednesday that 
mulheren had not been getting the drug properly while in federal 
custody

lossplagued lorimar telepictures 
corp which earlier this week said it was discussing a merger with 
warner communications inc said today it has received an 
unsolicited 7803 million takeover bid from investor marvin davis 
the 17ashare price being offered by davis is in the middle of 
the 14 to 20 range that analysts have said lorimar should be able 
to fetch and was seen as triggering a bidding war for lorimar 
lorimar stock jumped 137 a share to 1575 in early trading 
after announcement of the offer from davis the company has 459 
million shares outstanding 
it hasnt been disclosed what sort of terms are being discussed 
in talks between lorimar and new yorkbased warner those talks 
which began last weekend have been described by both sides as 
preliminary 
davis has been seeking to get back into the entertainment 
business since selling 20th century fox film corp to media magnate 
rupert murdoch in 1985 for 575 million davis had owned fox for 
four years but the company was beset by persistent losses 
last year he made an unsuccessful 3219 million bid for the 
906 percent he didnt already own of texasbased spectradyne inc 
the nations largest supplier of cable television and payperview 
movies for hotels 
in a brief announcement lorimar noted that davis offer was 
subject to a number of conditions and said it would bear davis 
letter in mind 
lorimar is a leading producer of original television 
programming but in recent years it has been troubled as its 
ambitious plans to expand into other areas disintegrated and 
sometimes caused the company to incur losses or heavy costs that 
depressed earnings 
for the first nine months of its current fiscal year lorimar 
posted a loss of 826 million on revenue of 6168 million the 
deficit included 45 million in writedowns on five movies and 22 
million in reserves for possible future losses in its homevideo 
unit 
management of both the movie and homevideo units have been 
replaced 
for fiscal 1987 ended last march 31 the company lost 586 
million mostly because of restructuring costs on revenue of 
7662 million

four disgruntled shareholders filed a 
classaction lawsuit against lorimar telepictures corp alleging 
the company overstated its income and net worth causing investors 
to pay more for stock 
the federal suit filed wednesday also alleges that lorimar 
misled investors to believe that problems in the companys 
videocassette division were cleared up and would cause no further 
financial problems the suit said 
lorimar spokeswoman sue binford said there would be no comment 
because company officials have not yet seen the suit 
last june lorimar reported in a letter to shareholders that the 
company had suffered substantial losses of 315 million but said 
the problems in the videocassette division were resolved the suit 
alleged 
however a recent company announcement indicated that additional 
problems in the videocassette division could cost another 22 
million the suit said 
the suit which asks for general damages seeks to represent an 
estimated hundreds of thousands of shareholders who traded on 30 
million shares between aug 14 1986 and feb 12 of this year 
the plaintiffs all from westchester county ny are 
identified as ted streit eli berman shirley sichel and louis 
haber they bought lorimar stock between september 1987 and 
december 1987 
earlier this week lorimar said it is discussing the possibility 
of being acquired by warner communications inc that information 
sent the firms stock price up 250 a share to 15 
and lorimar said today it has received an unsolicited 7803 
million takeover bid from investor marvin davis 
the culver citybased company was formed in february 1986 by the 
stockswap combination of lorimar inc best known as the producer 
of dallas and knots landing and new yorkbased 
telepictures corp which made most of its revenue from animated 
shows and other programs such as peoples court 
the company is producing 12 hours of primetime shows for the

getting more house for the money has been the 
perennial goal of young couples and many of them may have achieved 
it in a relatively unpublicized way 
the statistical evidence of the phenomenon is overwhelming and 
visual proof also is available from a stroll through certain 
neighborhoods in almost every city and town in the nation 
firsthome buyers have used the technique so have homeowners 
who found moveup houses priced beyond reach and so also have 
thousands of people who discovered that their own hands were the 
most useful tools ever made 
what all these people have done is enlarge existing homes to 
meet their needs rather than purchase larger homes in so doing 
some have saved more money than they ever could have accumulated in 
a savings account 
in many instances additions exceed the original 
statistics add documentation in 1977 additions and alterations 
amounted to 142 billion nationwide in 1987 the total exceeded 
40 billion in 1977 major replacement expenditures ran 57 
billion but triple that in 1987 
between 1980 and 1986 according to the national association of 
home builders remodeling activity increased 117 percent and often 
became the major occupation of companies that once considered 
themselves newhome builders 
one of the major factors in such activity is the soaring price 
of land especially as a percentage of the total price 
land accounted for only 11 percent of the total cost of a 
singlefamily home in 1949 but those were the good old days by 
1969 the percentage had jumped to 21 and by 1986 to 25 
meanwhile the relative cost of labor and materials has been 
shrinking from 69 percent in 1949 to 55 percent in 1969 to 47 
percent in 1986 
land costs therefore are something to be avoided by 
budgetconscious homebuyers inevitably the latest prices for land 
are included in the pricing of new homes since builders must cover 
their costs or go broke 
it isnt quite the same in an established neighborhood where 
new buyers sometimes find sellers arent quite as sensitive to the 
prices of lots and smart buyers know that a small house at a low 
price can be doubled in size 
existing homeowners seeking larger homes are also recognizing 
the same factors its an old story after weeks of examining 
prices of newer houses in which latest land prices are

japans unadjusted trade surplus with the united 
states fell 144 percent in february as imports from the united 
states reached record levels the finance ministry said thursday 
the politically sensitive surplus was squeezed by the strong 
japanese yen which makes it cheap for the japanese to buy 
foreignmade goods and inhibits sales of japanese goods abroad 
the japaneseus surplus fell to 340 billion from 397 
billion in february 1987 unadjusted for seasonal fluctuations 
exports to the united states rose 97 percent to 681 billion 
while imports from the united states soared by 519 percent to 
341 billion 
the imports from the united states broke the previous onemonth 
record of 312 billion set in june 1986 
japans overall trade surplus declined 265 percent in february 
as imports of foreign goods set another record the ministry said 
the overall surplus fell to 524 billion from 713 billion in 
february 1987 the 10th consecutive month of yeartoyear declines 
the february surplus was up from 307 billion in january but 
the ministry said the scope of trade usually dwindles in january 
because of japans long new year holidays 
imports shot up 480 percent from a year ago to a record 150 
billion in february while exports rose 172 percent to 202 
billion the previous high for imports was 148 billion in 
december 1987 
imports of us aircraft in the month nearly tripled to 478 
million 
the ministry said the aircraft purchases were a special factor 
in february but over the last several months export growth has 
been held back and imports have been encouraged by the yens sharp 
rise against the us dollar the dollar was trading at 128 yen in 
february compared with 152 yen a year earlier 
meanwhile machinery imports from the united states in february 
grew by 779 percent to 126 billion and motor vehicle imports 
rose 916 percent to 156 million 
japanese motor vehicle exports to the united states fell 54 
percent to 171 billion 
japan ran a february trade surplus of 194 billion with the 
european economic community up by 4 million from a year earlier 
because of large oil imports japans deficit in trade with the 
middle east rose to 120 billion from 844 million in february 
1987

the retailers fullyear sales totaled 256 billion up from

from the sale of dayton hudsons b dalton booksellers chain 
excluding that gain dayton hudsons earnings rose 11 percent in 
the latest quarter 
dayton hudsons fourthquarter figures reflect some positive

sluggish sales analysts said consumers were bored by the fall and 
winter fashions in most stores 
for the full year charming shoppes said it earned 426 
million up 5 percent from 405 million in 1986 sales totaled

more than 24 million jobs are expected to be 
created in the united states this year fewer than in 1987 but 
still a very healthy number a business research company said 
thursday 
manufacturers and companies with fewer than 20 employees will 
again be leaders in creating jobs according to dun amp bradstreet 
corp which announced the results of its annual survey of 
employment expectations at 5000 companies 
last year the us economy created about 3 million jobs the 
labor department announced last week that the nations civilian 
unemployment rate fell to 57 percent in february its lowest point 
since 1979 
dun amp bradstreet has predicted in a separate report that the 
jobless rate will average 57 percent this year down from an 
average of 62 percent last year the new jobs will be filled by 
new entrants to the labor force 
the goodsproducing sector aided by a cheaper dollar is likely 
to produce more than 610000 jobs this year the most since 1979 
dun amp bradstreet said 
in contrast the goodsproducing sector lost 180000 jobs in 
1986 and then added 210000 last year as it began to recover the 
company said 
this represents a significant departure from the pattern in 
recent years when job growth was driven largely by the services 
sector joseph w duncan the chief economist said in a news 
release 
the hot spot so to speak in 1988 is going to be the 
industrial midwest reid gearhart a dun amp bradstreet analyst 
said in an interview 
companies with fewer than 20 employees are expected to generate 
35 percent of the new jobs in 1988 even though they make up less 
than 19 percent of total employment the company said 
similarly it said companies with fewer than 100 employees are 
likely to generate just over half of the new jobs in spite of 
making up only a third of the employment 
companies with over 25000 employees are likely to lag again in 
1988 contributing slightly less than 7 percent of new jobs in 
spite of making up 20 percent of employment dun amp bradstreet said 
just over 32 percent of manufacturers in the survey said they 
expected to increase employment the highest of any sector the 
corresponding figures in other sectors were 128 percent in 
agriculture 278 percent in mining 313 percent in construction 
275 percent in transportation and public utilities 301 percent 
in wholesale and retail trade 257 percent in finance insurance 
and real estate 315 percent in services and 255 percent in 
government

grain and soybean futures closed moderately lower 
thursday on the chicago board of trade as traders showed little 
buying interest 
of overriding concern was an expectation that a march 31 
government report on spring plantings will show a broad increase in 
crop acreage said ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
other maret pressures include the large soybean crop now being 
harvested in south america an increase in world vegetableoil 
production and the lackluster prospects for new grain export sales 
to the soviet union in the near term mao said 
its a combination of all that in the atmosphere of a market 
thats been kind of on the defensive and its just feeding on 
itself temporarily mao said 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 291 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 1 cents lower with march at 197 a bushel oats were 3 cents 
to 5 cents lower with march at 181 a bushel soybeans were 4

italian investor carlo de benedetti 
who is vying for control of belgiums biggest holding company 
thursday called for an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of 
societe generale de belgique sa 
de benedetti said he would ask the meeting to consider himself 
and two of his belgian allies andre leysen of gevaert nv and 
pierre scohier of copeba sa as company directors 
de benedetti and an array of belgian and international partners 
claim to control over 47 percent of the companys 282 million 
shares 
a francobelgian alliance is fighting de benedettis bid to get 
control of societe generale and claims a majority stake of 52 
percent 
the group formed around belgiums biggest insurer group ag and 
the french investment firm companie financiere de suez has also 
said it would like a shareholders meeting to discuss the companys 
future but has not called for a specific date 
in addition it stressed it is willing to talk with de 
benedetti but only on the condition that the italian admits he 
does not have control of the company 
while the uncertainty on the corporate battle continued suez 
president renaud de la geniere said the fight could take months 
perhaps but i hope i will not take years 
de la geniere had talks with caretaker prime minister wilfried 
martens on the takeover bid but no details were available 
in a statement released by his french investment company cerus 
sa de benedetti said the shareholders meeting should discuss how 
many directors should run the company which controls a third of 
the belgian economy 
any shareholder with at least 20 percent of the share capital is 
able to convene such a meeting according to belgian commercial law 
the stakes each side holds could change dramatically since a 
brussels court approved a capital increase of 12 million shares for 
societe generale both camps claim they are entitled to the new 
stock a higher court still has to rule on the increase 
to sidestep the issue de benedetti announced a request would be 
made at the meeting that the company not make use of its recent 
capital increase 
leysen said de la geniere had made similar suggestions earlier 
and said the two sides might agree to annul the capital increase 
the shares were issued by societe generale immediately after it 
was aware of de benedettis intentions which it considers hostile 
the increase would dilute the stakes each side currently holds 
de benedetti wants to turn the 166yearold company into a 
holding company for enterprises across europe anticipating 1992 
when the movement of goods capital and people should be free 
throughout the 12nation european economic community 
the alliance fighting de benedetti wants the company to remained 
focused in belgium

after almost 70 years of tallying 
livestock sales at the historic pens of the fort worth stockyards 
the livestock market news service said its reports are headed for 
their last roundup 
government officials have issued daily or weekly reports on 
sales at the pens since around 1920 but said wednesday that so few 
cattle and hogs are sold in the city still nicknamed cowtown that 
regular sales reports will be halted march 31 
the oldest cattle pens in fort worth date to 1887 but as urban 
growth has swallowed the stockyards cattle raisers have turned 
away from the maze of traffic lights and freeways to competing 
auctions in small towns said rick wahrmund statewide director of 
the livestock market news service 
ronnie steen who has been reporting stockyard sales since 1976 
said sales have dropped to between 200 and 300 cattle a week for 
months from an average of about 5000 weekly in 1976 daily 
auctions have long since been replaced with a weekly cattle auction 
on mondays 
we dont have enough cattle to know what the market is 
steen said sales volumes of at least 500 are needed to establish 
clear market trends for farmers ranchers and others who use the 
information 
the us department of agriculture began issuing daily livestock 
reports from the fort worth stockyards around 1920 when annual 
sales regularly topped 6 million cattle 1 million hogs and 400000 
sheep

retailing giant gbinnobm sa one of 
belgiums biggest companies proclaimed a poison pill takeover 
defense thursday to thwart potentially hostile acquirers 
the company said it issued new bonds with warrants to five 
friendly companies which if fully exercised would create 61 
million new shares inflating the total shares outstanding by 
nearly 20 percent to 371 million shares this would make it 
difficult for a hostile bidder to buy the retailer 
its stock value soared 51 percent last week on rumors that a 
takeover bid might be imminent 
since belgium does not have any disclosure rules for investors 
in publicly traded companies it was not clear whether a takeover 
might be planned 
the company said it knew of no parties interested in acquiring 
it but undertook the takeover defense in the interest of 
protecting shareholder value and supporting management policies it 
said the unusual movement of the shares in recent days had 
created uncertainty 
the move by gbinnobm came against a background of sudden 
management uncertainty caused by a hostile takeover fight 
surrounding belgiums biggest company societe generale de belgique

canadian liquor giant seagram co ltd proposed 
the ultimate in mixed drinks thursday announcing it will buy 
orange juice producer tropicana products inc for 12 billion to 
expand seagrams share of the beverage market 
the canadian liquorandbeverage giants acquisition of 
tropicana from beatrice us food corp marks a diversification 
and an expansion of seagrams product line seagram chairman 
edgar m bronfman said in a statement 
securities analysts said the move into the orange juice business 
was a logical step for seagram which has limited growth potential 
through its liquor products 
the purchase made throught the companys us subsidiary 
joseph e seagram amp sons inc will be financed initially with a 
combination of bank loans and shortterm borrowings seagram said 
montrealbased seagram best known for its distilled spirits and

coolers and sells cocktail mixers such as tonic seltzer and ginger 
ale under the seagrams name 
seagram is also in the process of acquiring french cognac 
producer martell amp co in a deal valued at 930 million 
we have already broadened our base with seagrams wine 
coolers and tropicana is another step in this direction bronfman

tropicana with headquarters in bradenton fla is a wellknown 
fruit juice and beverage manufacturer and distributor it had sales 
of about 750 million in its last fiscal year which ended feb 29 
said marcelline thomson a seagram spokeswoman in new york 
tropicana is a leading producer of both readytoserve orange 
juice and frozen concentrate 
its a good fit said robert s reitzes who tracks seagram 
for the investment firm mabon nugent amp co in new york it makes 
sense in their business 
ian osler an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
toronto agreed saying orange juice is not that different from 
seagrams current businesses 
they understand the business and its growing unlike most of 
their liquor products osler said 
reitzes said it was possible seagram would use the tropicana 
name to introduce new products 
seagram had net income of nearly 4235 billion on sales of 33 
billion in the fiscal year ending jan 31 1987 and reported a 
profit of more than 4024 million on sales of 26 billion for the 
nine months ending oct 31 ms thomson said 
beatrice us food corp based in chicago is a division of 
closelyheld beatrice co which put itself up for sale last 
september 
beatrice chairman donald kelly had hoped to sell the company as 
a whole but could not find a buyer at his asking price reportedly 
45 billion 
beatrice spokesman charles long said the company also is 
considering selling its hunts tomato products and wesson oils 
lines 
beatrice also owns the meat company swiftekrich inc peter pan 
peanut butter and orville redenbacher popcorn 
the companys predecessor beatrice cos was taken private in

american federation of radio and television artists came late 
wednesday actors guild spokesman mark locher said thursday 
in 1987 actors were paid about 400 million for radio and 
television commercials according to advertisers the unions said 
the members earned 520 million 
its our breadandbutter contract said locher it 
certainly means survival to most actors between jobs 
if actors strike it will be the second labor action by a 
hollywood talent union this month the writers guild of america 
struck studios and producers on sunday 
in new york chief advertising group negotiator john mcguinn 
warned thursday that a strike could last as long as six months and 
urged advertisers to resist signing any interim agreements with the 
unions mcguinn made his comments at a television advertising 
seminar 
talks between sagaftra and the joint policy committee of the 
american association of advertising agencies and the association of 
national advertisers have been held in manhattan the two 
management agencies represent 400 advertisers and about 300 
agencies spokeswoman dorothy forget said 
negotiations for a new threeyear contract began january 11 
with the old contract expiring on feb 6 the joint union 
membership voted 93 percent for a strike authorization on march 2 
and talks broke off on march 7 
the joint sagaftra membership is more than 100000 the unions 
negotiate jointly on the issue of commercials 
advertising negotiator mcguinn and guild national executive 
secretary ken orsatti the chief bargaining agent for the actors 
both cited the matter of residuals from commercials shown on cable 
television as one unresolved point 
actors currently receive no residuals from cable television 
showings of their commercials after they have earned their first 
1000 in payments from showings on regular primetime television 
orsatti noted that virtually all commercials chosen for cable 
television have met the 1000 requirement 
orsatti also said advertisers want to take away the 10yearold 
cost of living clause in the commercial contract he said a cost of 
living raise has been the only kind of increase actors have had in 
the last two contracts 
deteriorating viewership of network television over the past six 
years has kept other commercial residual increases in check 
orsatti said 
management has used the argument that the erosion in the 
network area was caused by cable orsatti said but they are 
unwilling to consider any formula which restructures cable payments 
so that the performer has an opportunity to somewhat make up for 
those dollars lost on the network side 
orsatti said the union wants to negotiate actors payments for 
commercials shown on cable tv based on subscribers wit an actor 
receiving a oneday session fee of 333 for the first 20 million 
subscribers and another session fee for each additional 30 million 
subscribers thereafter 
mcguinn said the advertisers offered to pay one session fee for 
13 weeks of cable use regardless of any previous use of the 
commercial on broadcast newtorks he said the unions proposal 
would be too costly 
orsatti said several formulas have been discussed

union members on thursday accused eastern 
airlines parent company of trying to financially cripple the air 
carrier to win wage concessions 
the primary focus of our new management seems to have strayed 
from safety to cutting operating costs eastern pilot john 
knudson told a rally of 1500 union members and supporters 
union representatives said frank lorenzo chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp has stripped eastern of valuable assets and 
has hired merrill lynch to amass a 200 million strike fund 
under lorenzo eastern management also has asked pilots to fly 
in unsafe conditions and has harassed flight attendants union 
officials said 
a threeyear contract with the airlines 12000 members of the 
machinists union expired at the end of december negotiations have 
failed to produce a new agreement and the issues are now in federal 
mediation 
lorenzo purchased the miamibased airline in 1986 giant texas 
air also owns continental airlines people express new york air 
and other aviation subsidiaries 
these management practices of frank lorenzo are in direct 
contrast to the policies of the other six major carriers and they 
will spread like a cancer to the rest of the industry if they are 
ignored now knudson said 
paula musto a spokeswoman for eastern said the rally was a 
union attempt to gain public support during contract negotiations 
we feel that its public grandstanding while were in the 
midst of contract negotiations with our largest union ms musto 
said 
protesters who rallied a block from the philadelphia offices of 
eastern and merrill lynch said they did not want boycotts of 
either company but wanted to raise public awareness about what they 
called unionbusting practices 
demonstrations will be scheduled in other cities including 
houston denver and los angeles said joseph b uehlein an aflcio 
official who is coordinating a national campaign against lorenzo 
and merrill lynch 
eastern has sold the airlines most valuable assets such as 
widebody planes and its computerized reservation system to 
subsidiaries for less than market value uehlein and other union 
officials said 
in complaining about the airlines safety concerns knudson who 
has been with eastern for 21 years said he was grounded for six 
days in september 1987 after refusing to fly a plane with a broken 
altitude alert 
the warning device which tells pilots when they have strayed 
from a set altitude is required on all civil passenger planes he 
said knudson said he was reinstated when eastern failed to show 
sufficient cause for his grounding 
knudson also said his copilot had been asked to fly more than 
the 30 hours allowed during a sevenday period 
nancy tauss a flight attendant and vice president of the 
transport workers union said eastern management had searched 
flight attendants and fired others for technicalities 
our people go to work each day not knowing if theyre going to 
be fired she said 
ms musto said work rules ignored for years were being 
enforced recently 
of easterns 32000 employees 7000 belong to the transport 
workers union and 3600 belong to the air line pilots association 
union officials said their contracts expire later this year 
eastern lost 182 million on total revenue of 44 billion in 
1987 and has lost 500 million since airline deregulation in 1978

gold and platinum futures prices made strong gains thursday 
partly in response to a rise in the price of crude oil to 16 a 
barrel for the first time this month analysts said 
on other markets stockindex futures fell sharply grain and 
soybean prices retreated broadly and livestock and meat futures 
were mixed 
the sharp increase in energy futures prices on a rumored 
production cut by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
had inflationary implications that supported precious metals 
futures analysts said 
theres a view in the market that inflations going to be 
picking up toward the end of the year and that inflation is going 
to be more of a concern than recession at year end said fred 
demler metals economist for drexel burnham lambert inc in new 
york 
in addition talk of physical tightness developing in the cash 
platinum market after two quarters of price weakness helped spur 
buying of platinum futures and some of that buying interest 
spilled over into the gold market demler said 
demler said the gold and platinum markets were oversold and due 
for an upside correction to bring futures prices more in line with 
reality 
silver futures declined slightly 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 7 to 840 
higher with the contract for delivery in april at 44450 a troy 
ounce silver was 33 cents to 37 cents lower with march at 6265 
a troy ounce 
platinum settled 1680 to 1850 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with april at 49810 
the rumors of opec production cuts that fueled the jump in 
energy futures on the new york mercantile exchange were later 
denied but oil prices fell only slightly from their highs of the 
day 
market players still expect opec nations to take measures aimed 
at boosting prices said bob baker an analyst for prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 51 cents 
higher with april at 16 a barrel heating oil was 72 cent to 107 
cents higher with april at 4393 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 66 cent to 114 cents higher at 4514 cents a gallon 
inflationary fears also contributed to a sharp drop in 
stockindex futures on the chicago mercantile exchange analysts 
said 
the chicago mercantile exchanges contract for march delivery of 
the standard amp poors 500 index settled 675 points lower at 
26290 nearly a full point below the spot index 
grain and soybean futures closed broadly lower on the chicago 
board of trade with little buying interest in the face of bearish 
fundamentals 
traders expect a march 31 government report on spring plantings 
will show a general increase in crop acreage said ted mao grain 
specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc 
other market pressures include the large soybean crop now being 
harvested in south america an increase in world vegetableoil 
production and the lackluster prospects for new grain export sales 
to the soviet union in the near term mao said 
wheat settled 4 cents to 9 cents lower with march at 290 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with march at 197 a

a powerful house committee chairman told the 
secretary of energy thursday the reagan administrations plan to 
sell the naval petroleum reserves in california and wyoming 
doesnt look good 
privatization means let somebody have it so they can make some 
money rep jamie whitten dmiss told secretary john 
herrington after recounting how he stopped the sale of the elk 
hills oil reserve in california as a young member of congress in 
1943 
i have a long memory said whitten who is chairman of the 
appropriations committee and as such a member of the subcommittee 
on energy and water development before which herrington appeared 
according to his account the potential 1943 buyer would have taken 
oil from the field for immediate use and repaid the navy at such a 
slow rate that it would have taken 450 years to square accounts 
though still called naval petroleum reserves the two oil fields 
have been controlled by the energy department in commercial 
production since the mid1970s 
whittens objections were seconded by the ranking republican on 
the subcommittee rep john t myers of indiana who said ive 
never understood why you wanted to sell that and pump in new oil 
into storage in the strategic petroleum reserve in lousiana and 
texas 
the elk hills field 22 percent owned by chevron corp and the 
rest by the government is not a reserve its a cash cow being 
milked for money by a revenuehungry congress herrington said 
we had no business selling oil from there elk hills at 8 
and 10 a barrel in the price collapse of 1986 said herrington 
but the department did not have authority to suspend production as 
a private owner would have done he said 
the administrations budget request assumes that sale of the two 
oil fields will bring in 35 billion over the next two fiscal 
years the departments consultants said proceeds could be 43 
billion and herrington told the subcommittee the amount could be 
as high as 7 billion if congress allows the sale 
youre going to have to get 3 million barrels a day or 4 
million barrels a day into the economy on an asap basis and you 
cant do that at elk hills said herrington 
thus he said it makes sense to sell the naval reserves and use 
the money to buy oil for the louisianatexas stockpile because elk 
hills can produce only about 115000 barrels a day and the teapot 
dome reserve in wyoming can produce only about 3000 barrels a day 
the salt domes of the gulf coast now hold 540 million barrels of 
crude oil roughly the equivalent of 90 days of imports and can 
pump oil to refineries at the rate of 35 million barrels a day 
if the sale goes through the department proposes to use the 
money to increase additions to the strategic reserve from 50000 
barrels a day to 100000 barrels a day
