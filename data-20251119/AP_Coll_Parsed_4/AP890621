more than 7 million in proceeds from the sale of 
foreclosed homes may be missing from the department of housing and 
urban and developments regional office here federal auditors say 
however huds regional chief said the files that will account 
for the money are simply in storage and are being recovered 
the denver hud office is a major focus of a nationwide inquiry of 
wrongdoing at hud during the reagan administration under 
thensecretary samuel pierce 
the agency has been rocked by allegations that money to 
rehabilitate rundown housing for the poor and elderly was handed 
out to developers who hired highpriced consultants with ties to the 
republican party or the administration 
in addition an escrow agent in maryland has said she embezzled 
5 million in money due the government from the sale of foreclosed 
property and gave most of the proceeds to the poor investigators 
have dubbed mary louise harrell robin hud 
an auditors report released tuesday raised the possibility that 
the denver office may not have received 7279136 
federal auditors have given the office eight days to come up with 
the missing records on 173 foreclosed homes sold in the past five 
years or face sanctions 
hud regional officials knew the files were missing as early as 
feb 9 according to the report by the hud inspector generals 
office the report indicates the investigation into singlefamily 
home sales handled by the office began in january 
the report said 471 home sales were chosen by auditors for 
review but records on 173 couldnt be found 
according to the report documentation that proceeds were 
transferred to hud bank accounts was lacking for many other sales 
isaiah ike kelley acting hud administrator in denver said 
the files which have been missing since february are stored in 
agencys archives 
kelley said the audit covered home sales from 1984 to 1988 
i dont know what happened back then but i can tell you that 
as acting administrator i will make sure the regional inspector 
general obtains those files immediately said kelley who took 
over in april 
earlier this month a hud accountant in denver douglas turner 
was suspended on suspicion of diverting 1 million to his own 
account 
the auditors report accused regional officials of lax 
recordkeeping 
auditors complained they found active and inactive files together 
and that boxes of records were allowed to sit open at the regional 
office for indefinite periods before being put in storage 
the report also criticized the practice of not requiring private 
agents who sell foreclosed properties for hud to confirm that 
proceeds were deposited in hud bank accounts normally when a hud 
home is sold the proceeds are wired immediately to the agencys 
washington office 
of the 256 sales packages examined 145 did not have wire 
transfer confirmations the report said

judgeships tuesday in an election ordered by a federal judge who 
said mississippis judicial districts discriminated against blacks 
one other black candidate was narrowly leading one was trailing 
and two others lost election bids two blacks were unopposed as a 
result of the court order that forced the redrawing of judicial 
districts prior to the election mississippi had four black judges 
also on the ballot were three proposed constitutional amendments 
to repeal outdated and unused provisions one would eliminate the 
poll tax adopted to discourage black voting but struck down by the 
us supreme court in 1966 
the four blacks among mississippis 78 judges are supreme court 
justice reuben anderson circuit judges fred l banks jr and lillie 
blackmonsanders and chancery judge isaac byrd 
each was appointed to fill a vacancy but anderson went on to win 
a full eightyear term in 1986 byrd did not seek election this 
year the two others sought regular terms tuesday 
with 79 of 85 precincts reporting tuesday night blackmonsanders 
trailed republican challenger richard watson by 8265 votes to 
10917 banks and one other black democrat isadore w patrick of 
vicksburg were unopposed in the general election 
the two black winners were pat wise a democrat who defeated 
republican billy w keyes for an open hinds county chancery judges 
post by 5942 votes to 1638 and denise sweet owens also democrat 
who defeated republican george m arthur in another open family

incumbent circuit judge gray evans in the fourth district 395 votes 
to 348

incumbent circuit judge howard q davis jr in the fourth district 
4046 votes to 2063 
another black candidate harold brittain also a democrat ran 
fourth in a fourway race for two judgeship posts in the 20 circuit 
court district the winners were incumbents robert l goza a 
democrat and alfred nichols a republican 
in 1987 us district judge william h barbour jr ruled that 
the states judicial districts discriminated against blacks the 
ruling the first to apply the 1965 voting rights act to judicial 
elections was upheld on appeal 
barbour ordered some districts redrawn to create minority 
subdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity to 
elect black judges 
the ruling and appeals put judicial elections in the state on 
hold until this year when all 69 circuit court and chancery court 
judgeships are being filled no supreme court judgeships are on the

the senate foreign relations committee 
postponed action on three of president bushs ambassadorial nominees 
tuesday after democrats complained their only visible qualifications 
are large gop contributions 
sen paul sarbanes dmd initiated the delay when he complained 
that us ambassadors should have at least some qualifications for 
the job 
the senate is set to close down for the independence day recess 
so sarbanes request for a oneweek delay effectively stops until 
mid july at the earliest any action on the nominations to fill 
ambassadorships in spain australia and new zealand 
in the past weve had to hold our noses and let similar 
nominees with political connections go through sarbanes said but 
eventually someone ought to say stop 
if its going to be a bidding war at least we should put it 
up for public bids so the money goes to the us treasury 
sarbanes said 
sarbanes targeted three they are 
joseph zappala a florida land developer and national 
cochairman of bushs fund raising committee who has been nominated 
to be us ambassador to spain sarbanes said he contributed 
126000 to the bush campaign 
marvin sembler a florida shopping center tycoon who has been 
named to be ambassador to australia sarbanes said sembler was a 
127000 bush contributor 
della newman a seattle wash residential real estate broker 
who has been nominated to be ambassador to new zealand she is a 
longtime personal friend of bush and was chairman of the washington 
state bush for president committee sarbanes said she had no 
apparent qualifications except her personal and political ties 
there seems to be a 100000 threshhold for ambassadorships 
sarbanes said 
sarbanes did reluctantly permit the committee to approve the 
nomination of c howard wilkins jr a 115000 contributor to the 
bush campaign wilkins has been named to be ambassador to the 
netherlands and with the committees action an ambassador will be 
in place when bush visits the country next month 
the full senate later approved the wilkins nomination on a voice 
vote 
sen connie mack rfla defended the records of the two 
floridians on sarbanes list saying to imply they are not capable 
is a disservice 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said what were doing is 
delaying the appropriate representation this country should have 
overseas 
and sen richard lugar rind said the overall composition of 
bushs ambassadorial nominees to date is no different than the 
choices of the reagan administrations twothirds foreign service 
professionals and one third political appointees 
these nominees are friends of the president a part of the 
organization of his coming to the presidency lugar said they 
share his ethos his idealism and they will be so perceived in the 
nations to which they are being sent 
sarbanes said he has no objection to political nominees as such 
as long as they can claim some qualifications for the posts to which 
they are named he noted he did not object to bushs nomination of 
former republican gov robert d orr of indiana to be ambassador to 
singapore 
he said orr had demonstrated his capabilities during his eight 
years service as governor beginning in 1980 
the committee did vote to recommend the senate confirm orr and a 
list of other nominees 
they are 
thomas niles named to be us representative to the european 
community 
morton i abramowitz to be ambassador to turkey 
edward n ney to be ambassador to canada 
richard h solomon to be assistant secretary of state for east 
asian and pacific affairs 
melvyn levitsky to be assistant secretary of state for 
international narcotics matters 
jewel s lafontant to be ambassadoratlarge for refugee 
affairs 
e patrick coady to be us executive director for the 
international bank for reconstruction and development 
mark l edelman to be deputy administrator of the agency for 
international development

the government says romania has nearly 
completed construction of a 6foot barbed wire fence along its 
border with hungary but cast doubt on a foreign press report that a 
brick wall is being built 
the times of london on monday reported that bucharest is building 
a wall along its border with hungary and yugoslavia to prevent 
defections 
hungarys official mti news agency said tuesday that its border 
guards had reported no signs of wall construction 
nevertheless a 2meter wire fence is being set up on the 
romanian side of the border which has been completed along 90 
percent of the border length the agency said 
since it appears to be an ordinary wire fence the hungarian 
border guards suppose that no electricity will be led into it the 
agency said it added that the fence is about 80 feet inside 
romanian territory 
the latest works indicate that ditches have been dug on both 
sides of the fence to prevent breakthroughs by cars mti said 
romanias border with hungary extends 275 miles 
an estimated 30000 romanians most of them ethnic hungarians 
have fled to hungary in the past few years seeking refuge from 
chronic hardships under the regime of president nicolae ceausescu 
ethnic hungarians also claim discriminatory policies toward 
minorities in romania 
during the first five months of this year 3231 romanians 
crossed ilegally into hungary deputy interior minister zoltan gal 
said last week 
he said the cabinet would soon discuss plans to open three 
refugees camps in eastern hungary to cope with the influx

after years of crusades to stop poachers from 
destroying the african elephant conservationists are reaping 
success with a series of national bans on ivory imports 
its been a real snowball effect said jorgen thomsen senior 
program officer for elephant conservation at the world wildlife fund 
since june 4 the united states japan the 12nation european 
economic community switzerland and canada have imposed bans on 
imported ivory the eec japan and the united states buy up to 75 
percent of the ivory on world markets 
hong kong the worlds major ivory dealer has announced a 
moratorium on raw ivory imports 
the 102nation convention on international trade in endangered 
species will consider a worldwide ban at a geneva meeting in october 
the conservationists sweeping success follows june 1 appeals by 
the world wildlife fund and wildlife conservation international the 
two groups said poachers were wiping out the elephant populations in 
africa faster than had been thought and the pachyderms could be 
extinct within 15 years 
but conservationists now fear that prospects of a worldwide ban 
could lead poachers to a frenzy of elephant killings unless interim 
measures are taken immediately 
an elephant holocaust across africa is likely unless consumer 
countries take immediate action the world wildlife fund said 
france on june 4 began the string of national actions against 
importing ivory and it was followed the next day by the united 
states 
penalties vary for violations in the united states the maximum 
is a year in jail and a 100000 fine 
president bush in announcing the us decision said we do 
this out of mounting concern for the rapid decline of the wild 
elephant one of natures most majestic creatures 
if their populations continue to diminish at current rates the 
wild elephant will soon be lost from this earth 
japan and hong kong are considered critical to any effective 
reduction in ivory demand japan is the largest importer accounting 
for 40 percent of the world market and hong kong is heavily 
involved in making ivory carvings for export 
the real victory is japan thomsen said hong kongs action 
was very much to save face because its two biggest customers 
japan and the united states had outlawed imports 
this proves that we have taken more responsibility as consumer 
countries he said we may have prevented a catastrophe credit 
should also be placed with the african countries who previously had 
opposed a ban but now realize the crisis situation 
hong kong began enforcing its crackdown quickly on sunday it 
seized 448 tusks and other ivory products worth an estimated 26 
million that officials said were to to have been smuggled to japan 
several african countries recently reversed their stands and took 
steps to protect their elephants last month kenya followed 
neighboring tanzania and somalia and called for a worldwide ban 
delegates at an organization of african unity conference that 
ended saturday recommended establishing a marketing cartel to ensure 
that money from the worldwide ivory trade benefits the continent 
conservationists estimate african elephant populations have 
dropped from 15 million in 1978 to between 400000 and 700000 
today 
they say ivory exports have increased from 300 tons a year in the 
1950s to more than 800 tons annually in this decade and prices are 
running at a record 91 per pound 
an aerial survey last year found about 20000 elephants in kenya 
fifteen years ago it had 121000 the number of elephants in 
tanzania has fallen to 80000 from 300000 in 1979 according to 
government officials 
conservationists say the elephant populations in most other 
african countries have suffered similar fates but zimbabwe 
botswana and south africa are the exceptions because of controls 
zimbabwe has annual elephant kills and a thriving legal trade in 
elephant products in the last 12 months it earned about 600000 in 
legal ivory sales 
poachers have killed most of the big male elephants in some 
countries and now their targets are females and young beasts 
according to a conservationists report released this month 
the result is that three times as many elephants must be killed 
to provide the same amount of ivory as 10 years ago 
the annual ivory haul must be reduced to at least a tenth of 
its present volume to enable populations to recover the report 
says the recovery of herds and family structure will take 20 
years or more if all poaching were stopped 
japan hong kong and other countries with thriving ivory 
industries and markets would be badly hurt if supplies are reduced 
to that level 
tamotsu ishibashi chairman of the tokyo ivory and craft 
cooperative association said even the current ban will have 
devastating effects on japans traditional ivorycarving industry 
he said some 25000 craftsman in about 80 workshops produce 138 
million worth of ivory products every year 
the majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of 
carving ivory from generation to generation and the new restriction 
certainly will affect them severely he said

swedes may not learn the name or see the 
face of the man accused of killing prime minister olof palme if they 
read only their national newspapers 
carl gustaf christer pettersson who is on trial for the 1986 
shooting is known in sweden only as the 42yearold 
under swedish press law the identity of a criminal suspect is 
never published unless he is convicted and sentenced and even then 
it must clearly be in the public interest 
the regulations are meant to protect the innocent and a 
newspaper and its senior editor can be fined for violating them 
but the palme murder trial has put the regulations under a 
strain and several provincial papers are disregarding them 
christer pettersson is a historic person whether guilty or 
not said per ahlstrom editor of nya norrland a daily with a 
circulation of 20000 in the northern town of harnosand 
i find that there is evident public interest that the name of 
the person accused of the murder becomes public knowledge he said 
international news agencies and foreign newspapers published 
petterssons identity and his police mug shot when he was charged in 
december 
swedish papers ran into difficulty when pettersson known as 
the 41yearold at the time had a birthday in april for a few 
weeks he was referred to as the 42yearold former 41yearold 
about 20 newspapers have flouted the regulations arguing it was 
ridiculous to try to hide his identity when foreign newspapers 
reporting the trial were available at major newsstands in sweden 
other ironies also have become evident 
under swedish freedom of information laws petterssons name was 
available after prosecutors filed the indictment last month anyone 
who calls the stockholm district court can ask the court clerk to 
read it over the telephone 
papers that have refrained from identifying pettersson have at 
the same time published every detail of his life including his 
police record the location of his home and interviews with former 
girlfriends 
kevin boyle director of the londonbased article 19 which 
monitors press freedom in 50 countries said the swedish regulations 
are highly exceptional if not unique 
it is remarkable in that it contradicts the openness of 
information in so many other areas where sweden leads the world 
boyle said in an interview 
he said the restrictions do not violate international law but 
they could inhibit the search for witnesses 
because of high public interest in the palme case the court let 
swedish radio broadcast the trial with a onesecond delay to allow a 
technician to cover petterssons name with an electronic beep 
the technician missed the beat the first time petterssons name 
was mentioned however 
the broadcasts have been debated heatedly 
professor carl magnus elwing of the university of lund said they 
have turned the trial into marketplace theater and diminished 
the stature of the court i would have acted forcefully to stop 
it elwing said 
some critics said testimony heard on the radio could influence 
subsequent witnesses 
presiding judge carlanton spak ruled the broadcasts were in line 
with the law and would be stopped only if they disturbed the trial 
itself 
since then most of the witnesses many of whom have criminal 
records have demanded that the broadcast be halted for their 
testimony and the court has complied 
press ombudsman torsten cars who is employed by the newspaper 
industry said the caution regarding petterssons name goes beyond 
the requirements of press ethics 
it would not change much if the name were printed considering 
all the descriptions of his life that already have been published 
he said and there are thousands of christer petterssons in 
sweden publishing the picture is more serious 
among those publishing the name is the newspaper arbetet in 
malmo a city across the oregrund straits from denmark where such 
restrictions do not apply 
arbetet was convicted of libel in 1987 and ordered to pay 27000 
in compensation to the 33yearold a suspect who earlier was 
detained and released without charges

a 19thcentury painting set in ancient rome of a 
young woman about to bathe has been sold at auction for 153450 
nearly 20000 times its 1956 purchase price of 8 
it certainly does reflect an extraordinary change in taste but 
that isnt unique in art said sothebys simon taylor after the 
sale tuesday of diadumene by sir edward poynter 
the auction house had expected more because of the vogue for 
onceneglected victorian works it had estimated the painting would 
fetch up to 232500 
poynter in 1885 had painted the young woman nude but he added 
diaphanous drapery after it was exhibited at the royal academy of 
arts and provoked letters from shocked viewers 
one letter to the press signed british matron said the 
writer had barred her daughters from going to the the exhibition 
another letter said the painting would produce a burning sense of 
shame in any modest woman on the arm of father brother or 
lover 
poynter was known for such paintings but his most famous work 
reproduced in the tens of thousands in its day was faithful unto 
death it depicted a roman sentry staying at his post during the

a heartbroken husband shot and killed his 
estranged wife tuesday in their divorce attorneys office then 
turned the gun on himself as the couples two young girls sat in the 
waiting room 
jose luis martinez 38 shot his wife josephine also 38 four 
times in the head with a 32caliber revolver threatened to shoot 
the attorney then shot himself in the head according to police and 
the attorneys secretary 
mrs martinez was declared dead at jamaica hospital 
martinez was in extremely poor condition at the same hospital and 
will likely be declared brain dead after tests are completed 
wednesday said administrative nursing supervisor robert stewart 
the couple who had been married since 1973 had come to the 
office of john j napolitano in queens on tuesday afternoon for an 
initial consultation about a divorce according to napolitanos 
secretary susan dasaro 
they went into the attorneys office and closed the door leaving 
their 8yearold and 6yearold girls in the reception area the 
father told them to wait out here dasaro said 
she said she no longer loved him he said he loved her a great 
deal napolitano said afterward 
napolitano said he served the divorce summons on martinez and 
told him to get an attorney 
then he stood up put his right hand behind his back and pulled 
out a gun napolitano said she sat down she pleaded for her 
life 
he put the gun identified by police as a 32caliber against 
her left temple and fired once 
napolitano said martinez then alternated between firing 
additional shots into mrs martinez and threatening him shoving the 
gun against napolitanos chest head and mouth 
he then said he was going to kill me and kill himself 
napolitano 58 said after about five minutes martinez put the gun 
to his face and shot himself 
we heard the gunshots and at first we didnt know what it was 
since the office is located near a busy intersection dasaro said 
after the third one that i heard we realized that it was coming 
from the office 
we ran out and we dragged the little girls out 
dasaro said they waited outside the office on the street about 10 
minutes before napolitano emerged 
i thought john was dead too she said then he came out and 
he just shook his head 
the girls did not witness the murder she said but were 
crying hysterically one saw the bodies being carried out 
a 12yearold son was not at the office at the time said officer 
hugh barry a police spokesman the children will probably be turned 
over to child welfare workers he said

nbc completed a 52week sweep of nielsen ratings 
despite cbs broadcast of the final game of the detroit pistons 
sweep of the los angeles lakers for the nba championship 
abcs roseanne was the no 1 show last week but nbc had an 
average primetime rating of 116 cbs had 102 and abc 92 
the last time nbc lost a week was to cbs the week of the seventh 
game of last years national basketball association championship 
when the lakers beat the pistons this year game four ranked fourth 
in the ac nielsen co primetime ratings with a 174 rating and 
31 share 
nbcs average rating for the 52 weeks was 144 cbs and abc tied 
with 116 
the top 10 shows during the past year were roseanne abc 
the cosby show nbc a different world nbc cheers nbc 
golden girls nbc 60 minutes cbs empty nest nbc dear 
john nbc whos the boss abc and murder she wrote cbs 
nbc has had eight of the top 10 shows 10 times during the past 
year cosby was first in the nielsens for 16 of the 52 weeks 
but ranked second behind roseanne for the year and third 
behind roseanne and cheers last week cosby had a lower 
rating and higher share because it is on at 8 pm edt when there 
are fewer people watching tv than at 9 pm when roseanne is on 
the rating is a percentage of the estimated 904 million homes in 
the united states that have televisions the share is a percentage 
of sets in use a show can have a lower rating and higher share than 
another show by getting a larger percentage of a smaller available 
audience 
nbc said another reason cosby fell behind roseanne for 
the year was because the newer abc show did not have to factor in a 
summer of reruns 
the top 10 shows last week were roseanne abc cheers 
nbc the cosby show nbc detroit pistons vs los angeles

hispanics flooded into california florida and 
texas and accounted for about onefourth of the nations total 
population growth in the first half of this decade the census 
bureau reports 
those states and new york each now have more than 1 million 
hispanics the bureau said in its first detailed analysis of 
minority populations since the 1980 census 
sixteen states led by new york had more than 1 million blacks 
as of 1985 while california had the most hispanics and other 
minorities the study found 
blacks comprise the nations largest minority at 289 million 
the study reported new york had the largest black population at 27 
million followed by california with 21 million blacks 
but the black population of california was growing faster adding 
243000 between 1980 and 1985 compared to a 219000 increase for 
the empire state 
the nations hispanic population jumped from 143 million in 1980 
to 175 million in 1985 through a combination of high birth rates 
and international migration although they were only 63 percent of 
the us population in 1980 hispanics made up about onefourth of 
the 12 million national population increase during the next 
halfdecade the report said 
california has the largest hispanic population the report 
showed at 59 million onethird of all hispanics in the nation 
texas was second at 37 million followed by new york at 19 
million and florida with 11 million 
california added 13 million hispanics between 1980 and 1985 
while texas gained 700000 florida new york and illinois also 
added more than 100000 hispanics each 
among states with a million or more blacks the fastest growth 
rate for that group 16 percent was posted by florida 
mississippi had the largest proportion of blacks in its 
population 36 percent the report found followed by south 
carolina 31 percent and louisiana 30 percent 
during the first half of this decade only west virginia and the 
district of columbia had a decline in black population 
more than four out of five blacks reside in metropolitan areas 
the bureau found and the shift continued to be in favor of cities 
with blacks migrating out of rural southern regions and into urban 
areas 
the report added that four metropolitan areas have more than 1 
million black residents new york 32 million chicago 16 
million los angeles 12 million and philadelphia 11 million 
almost 90 percent of all hispanics live in metropolitan areas 
with more than half in seven metro areas the study found los 
angeles 36 million new york 23 million miami 815000 san 
francisco 775000 chicago 757000 houston 595000 and san 
antonio 568000 
the nation also included 73 million other minorities a category 
that includes asians pacific islanders american indians eskimos 
and aleuts this group jumped 19 million over five years largely a 
result of international migration 
with 23 million california was the leader in this category 
followed by hawaii 692000 and new york 516000 
texas virginia and new jersey had the fastest growing 
populations in this group however texas other races increased 67

democrats are failing to capitalize on family 
issues such as child care at the polls because they are afraid to 
take on the tax consequences of programs that voters say they 
support a party consultant says 
but a republican strategist warned womens groups that even 
though child care has emerged as an important campaign issue in 
recent years there are a lot of folks who just dont care about 
the issue 
celinda lake a democratic expert on electing women candidates 
and vince breglio a former campaign strategist for senate 
republicans before becoming president bushs chief pollster for the 
1988 campaign appeared on a panel at a meeting held by child care 
advocates tuesday 
panelist ethel klein an associate professor of political science 
at columbia university said a february poll by louis harris amp 
associates showed 87 percent approval for a joint government and 
private effort to meet child care needs she said 55 percent of 
those responding to a cbs news poll in february said the federal 
government had a responsibility to help parents pay for child care 
if they couldnt afford it 
breglio however said the most recent white house polls show 
that bushs child care program built around a tax credit has about 
5 percent to 6 percent more support than congressional legislation 
calling for direct government financing 
ms lake told the group that family issues ought to work very 
well for democrats they are policy issues where people want 
spending and they want it now not later they want government 
involvement 
we as democrats have not drawn strong enough political lines on 
this issue the consultant said democrats have tended to talk 
about small cost and all this has done is lose the punch of 
these issues because we have been afraid to take on the tax 
consequences the regulatory consequences of these programs and in 
fact voters think these issues are going to take big programs 
breglio said such family issues as child care first surfaced in 
political campaigns in 1986 
i had candidates who were beaten on those kinds of issues he 
said they were beaten because with my stupid advice they talked 
about national themes and ideology well national themes and 
ideology didnt sell in 1986 concern over nuclear waste and child 
care did we were wrong they were right and we lost many senate 
seats 
however he cautioned the group there are a lot of folks out 
there who feel strongly about it but i must tell you this there 
are a lot of folks who just dont care 
both consultants agreed that family issues will have significant 
impact in next years congressional elections 
i dont believe serious political candidates in 1990 can avoid 
discussing the issue of child care breglio said i dont 
believe they can avoid discussing the issue of longterm health 
care however he said he did not believe parental leave would be 
an issue 
ms lake predicted all three would be major issues particularly 
if congress passes child care and parental leave legislation and 
bush vetoes it on top of his veto of the recent bill raising the 
minimum wage 
breglio said bush is doing pretty well with women voters but 
if there is a whole series of vetoes on legislation that is of 
particular importance to women that could be a different ballgame 
the panel was sponsored by the child care action campaign a 
coalition seeking a national system of child care combining public 
and private resources the great american family tour a nonprofit 
nonpartisan organization dealing with family policy issues headed 
by rep patricia schroeder dcolo and lifetime television a 
venture of hearstabcviacom entertainment services 
which produce a documentary entitled hush little baby the 
challenge of child care

the phrase doggie do has a different 
meaning for two sisters who make it their livelihood 
diane fenger and arlene steinle train canine coiffeurs to handle 
everything from american kennel club show styles to the occasional 
doggie dye job 
the words dog groomer are taboo at their tara lara academy of 
k9 hair design because the sisters believe thats like saying the 
cordon bleu turns out cooks 
we arent teaching basic dog grooming said fenger who 
founded the school 20 years ago with her sister we are teaching 
allbreed styling including show work 
fenger a former hairdresser traded permanents for pooches in 
1968 the academy highlighted in the sisters book the standard 
book of dog grooming draws students from around the country the 
school isnt cheap 795 for a fourweek groomers assistant course 
up to 2995 for a 16week master course 
students scrub dogs in tubs cut their hair and dry it with a 
blow dryer or a heated cage dryer the finishing touch includes 
ribbons scarves or bells fenger said she also teaches students how 
to handle the dogs including touching the animals in specific

government handouts have come a long way since the 
federal government doled out surplus cheese in massachusetts 
theyre giving away toilets 
this summer the massachusetts water resources authority hoping 
to promote an ethic of water conservation is handing out 2500 
lowflow toilets to communities for public use 
the municipal toilet replacement program is designed with the 
hope that after residents try the toilets at their town hall or 
public library they will buy one for their home said jeffrey 
lissack a spokesman for the program the toilets cost the authority 
350000 
the authority needs to save water to continue adequately 
supplying water to 25 million people in the boston area 
toilets consume an average of 38 percent of household water 
conventional toilets use 35 gallons to 7 gallons per flush the 
model being given away uses 16 gallons or less 
starting march 2 the state will require that all new toilets use 
no more than 16 gallons of water per flush which is expected to 
save more than 3 million gallons of water daily

oliver l norths sentencing is postponed while 
the judge considers defense charges that one of the irancontra 
jurors who convicted the former white house aide deliberately lied 
during jury selection 
us district judge gerhard a gesell postponed fridays 
scheduled sentencing after norths lawyers produced evidence that 
juror tara king failed to disclose that a brother had been convicted 
of armed robbery and that two others had arrest records 
the defense also alleged that ms kings statements to reporters 
after the verdict that she used marijuana and cocaine before the 
trial suggests she was under the influence of drugs during the trial 
ms king told interviewers that she did not use drugs during her 
jury service 
the judge on tuesday postponed sentencing until july 5 and 
scheduled a june 28 hearing on defense allegations that ms king 
intentionally withheld the information when she filled out a 
questionnaire given to prospective jurors 
the questionnaire asked if any member of her family had ever been 
a party or witness to a civil or criminal court proceeding or had 
been under investigation by law enforcement authorities 
the 35yearold office worker answered the question in the 
negative 
this apparently intentional misstatement raises serious 
questions as to juror bias and impartiality norths lawyers said 
in pleadings that were unsealed tuesday by the judge 
gesell might be forced to grant a mistrial if the defense can 
prove that it learned after the verdict that ms king deliberately 
withheld information to get on the jury 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh in other pleadings ordered 
unsealed said north and his lawyers must prove that they learned 
about ms kings misstatements after the verdict 
otherwise his motion constitutes an impermissible attempt to 
sandbag the judicial process walsh said quoting from a 1982 
appellate court decision 
gesell gave norths lawyers until friday to state the precise 
date and time when counsel first learned each fact 
walsh also argued that ms king may have inadvertently answered 
the question incorrectly noting that she is nearly 17 years younger 
than the brother convicted of armed robbery in 1987 
walsh said it was possible that any knowledge she did have 
simply did not come to mind at the time she completed the jury 
questionnaire particularly since ms king has 14 brothers and 
sisters 
during the trial the defense did not seek to replace two jurors 
with alternates following media reports that they had failed to 
disclose involvements in lawsuits arising from traffic accidents 
walsh also contended there was no evidence that ms king was 
biased against north 
if king developed any prejudice from her brothers trouble 
with law enforcement it would likely be directed against the 
prosecution not defendants walsh said 
north 45 a retired marine lieutenant colonel faces a possible 
10year sentence 
the jury convicted north of aiding and abetting the obstruction 
of a congressional inquiry into the iranconta affair destroying or 
altering official documents and accepting an illegal gratuity the 
installation of a security fence outside his home by arms dealer 
richard v secord 
north was acquitted of nine other charges

exxon corp and other big oil companies say 
theyll spend 250 million over five years to sharpen their ability 
to combat massive oil spills and the bush administration is 
stepping up surveillance of the alaska oil system 
the major oil companies in their first comprehensive step to 
improve contingency planning for big spills said tuesday they will 
create a nationwide network of response teams capable of handling an 
accident as large as the exxon valdez disaster anywhere on us 
coastal waters 
the plan is voluntary which environmental groups and some 
members of congress said minimizes its importance and underscores 
the need for federal legislation to require better response 
capabilities 
when it comes to the protection of our fragile environment 
good faith simply is not good enough said sen joseph i 
lieberman dconn he said he will introduce legislation thursday to 
increase oil companies financial liability for oil spills 
transportation secretary samuel skinner meanwhile said the 
government will begin a comprehensive safety inspection of the 
800mile alaska pipeline later this month two years earlier than 
scheduled as a precautionary measure 
the exxon valdez oil spill has taught us a valuable lesson the 
need to avoid complacency when it comes to protecting our 
environment skinner said 
on capitol hill on tuesday a senate committee approved a bill 
providing a range of spillprevention actions including randam 
alcohol testing of oil tanker crews 
the bill backed by sen ted stevens ralaska would open 
highway driving records of merchant mariners to the coast guard 
provide for alcohol testing of people in safetysensitive jobs on 
tankers and improve radar systems to aid in tracking ships through 
potentially hazardous areas 
richard m morrow chairman of the american petroleum institute 
which sponsored development of the industrys new spillresponse 
plan said it is not designed to head off legislation to force more 
responsibility on the companies 
we want to move forward regardless of what congress does he 
told a news conference 
the industry plan includes measures aimed at preventing future 
disasters and establishing clearer lines of government authority for 
reacting to tanker accidents 
allen e murray chairman of mobil corp and head of a special 
task force that produced the plans after two months of study said 
the industry hopes to have the new system in full operation within a 
year 
environmental groups generally welcomed the program but said they 
want to see it implemented before assessing its longterm importance 
its a good step said gaylord nelson counsel to the 
wilderness society a washingtonbased environmental group 
theyre finally recognizing that the country is aroused and 
outraged and theyre responding because they have to 
a key to success of the new system murray said is giving the 
coast guard full responsibility for deciding when industry cleanup 
crews will be called into action current lines of authority between 
state and federal agencies are unclear he said 
somebody has to be able to be in charge and not have to make a 
conference call and we think that should be the coast guard 
murray said 
the coast guard said tuesday it needs time to study the plan 
before commenting 
the plan will cost more than 250 million over the first five 
years adding onetwentieth of 1 cent a year to the oil companies 
cost of making a gallon of gasoline said morrow 
murray said the added expense will not be tacked onto gas prices 
at the pump 
its a cost of doing business for the industry well absorb 
it he said 
the plan will 
establish a petroleum industry response organization 
headquartered in washington dc and regional response centers 
in new york norfolk va new orleans long beach calif and 
seattle 
each center will be staffed around the clock by trained cleanup 
specialists and will be equipped to handle a 30000ton oil spill 
about the same as the valdez spill 
set up staging areas at 19 sites nationwide where response 
equipment such as oil skimmer boats and chemical dispersants will 
be stored 
spend 30 million to 35 million over five years on industry 
research programs to study the effects of oil spills on the 
environment ways of minimizing the effects on shorelines and 
techniques for recovering oil from the water

conviction by an allwhite jury provoked cries of racism by his 
attorneys was put to death in mississippis gas chamber early 
wednesday 
edwards 36 convicted of murdering a convenience store clerk 
during a 1980 crime spree lost two appeals just hours before the 
execution he was pronounced dead at 1215 am at the mississippi 
state penitentiary here 
the supreme court by a 72 vote had denied edwards request for 
a stay tuesday 
earlier tuesday the supreme court halted the execution of a 
missouri man convicted of killing an elderly couple shortly after 
that a federal judge in st louis granted a stay of execution for 
his accomplice 
leonard laws 39 and george gilmore 42 had been scheduled to 
die early wednesday morning 
the high courts ruling in the mississippi case was followed two 
hours later by a statement from gov ray mabus saying he refused to 
grant clemency for edwards 
i have reviewed the facts in the case of leo edwards and i 
will not stand in the way of the courts justice the governor 
said 
the facts are that leo edwards is a mass murderer who killed in 
cold blood he tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the 
courts and discrimination had no bearing on his case 
this is not casual justice leo edwards sentence is a result 
of his own crime and his fate now rests in gods hands the 
governor said 
edwards 36 of new orleans was convicted on april 1 1981 in 
the death of jackson convenience store clerk linzy don dixon during 
a robbery the robbery and killing were committed after edwards 
escaped from a louisiana prison

edwards was within less than 14 hours of a trip to the gas 
chamber on oct 25 1988 when the us supreme court stopped the 
scheduled execution

a handful of nuts a day may keep the heart 
attack away according to a group of california researchers 
a sixyear study of diet and fatal coronary heart disease among 
34000 california members of the seventhday adventists church found 
that nuts were the only food item listed with a statistically 
significant protection against heart attack death 
compared to a person who never ate nuts a person who ate them 
at least once a day had only 47 percent of the risk of fatal heart 
attack said dr gary e fraser coauthor of a study presented 
tuesday at the 2nd international conference of preventive cardiology 
making this even more significant is that a year ago we looked 
at nonfatal heart attacks and got findings that were extremely 
similar said fraser nuts seem to reduce the risk of both fatal 
and nonfatal heart disease 
the researcher cautioned that the study is from only one 
population group and should be interpreted as an interesting but 
still somewhat preliminary finding until other studies are done 
fraser said the data was collected through questionnaires mailed 
between 1976 and 1982 in a followup study the researchers found 
there had been 260 fatal heart attacks among those surveyed earlier 
the scientists then compared answers on the dietary questionnaires 
to determine what foods if any tended to suggest protection 
against heart disease 
significant protective relationships were seen with consumption 
of whole wheat bread nuts and citrus fruits the report said but 
in a further refinement of the data fraser said nuts appeared to be 
the major common food that protected against heart disease 
it was fairly consistent across the sexes by the age groups 
by smokers and nonsmokers and all of the major risk factors he 
said 
a resurvey of part of the study group determined that peanuts 
were the most commonly consumed nut chosen by about 60 percent of 
those questioned 
fraser said the questions dealt only with the frequency of nut 
consumption and found that the more often nuts were eaten the 
greater the protection those who ate nuts at least once a day did 
best 
as to quantity fraser said a handful of nuts or something 
like that was probably typical 
fraser said it is not now known what in nuts can provide 
protection from heart attack but he speculated that it could be the 
types of vegetable fats 
they are relatively fatty as vegetable foods go but they have 
much more polyunsaturated fat than most of the fatty foods one would 
eat he said other studies have shown that polyunsaturated fats 
tend to be less likely to cause coronary disease than saturated 
fats the type that is commonly in meats 
coauthors of the loma linda university study were dr joan 
sabate and dr david kissinger

a bill endorsed by the house ways and means 
committee tries to draw a distinction between careless taxpayers and 
those who are out to beat the system 
taxpayers also would face less chance of being penalized two or 
more times for the same mistake under the measure passed by a voice 
vote tuesday 
the bill would revamp the system of nearly 150 civil tax 
penalties that may be imposed by the internal revenue service and 
is intended to be part of the committees share of deficit reduction 
for the budget year that begins oct 1 
rep jj pickle dtexas chairman of the committees oversight 
panel and chief author of the overhaul said public hearings showed 
the current penalty structure is a confusing morass of complex 
overlapping penalties that are often unduly harsh or just plain 
irrational 
just 35 years ago the irs had only 13 penalties to enforce the 
growth is partly due to congress use of penalties to raise revenue 
authorities say 
in 1988 the irs assessed 26 million penalties totaling nearly 6 
billion 
the irs supports overhauling the penalty structure the rewriting 
is based on the notion that penalties should be used only to 
encourage compliance not to raise money 
an example of the changes present law imposes a 5 percent 
penalty for underpayment of tax the bill would raise that generally 
to 20 percent 
most of the changes involve penalties on banks and other payers 
that fail to file reports on interest and dividends paid and on 
employers that miss the deadline for turning over withheld taxes to 
the internal revenue service 
in most cases the revised penalties would be graduated so that 
the longer the delay in paying or filing and the more blatant the 
mistake the higher the penalty 
for example the penalty for failing to file an information 
return with the irs such as a form 1099 statement on which a bank 
reports interest paid to a depositor now is 50 for each failure 
to file the maximum is 100000 a year the bill would vary that 
from 15 for a few days tardiness a maximum of 75000 a year to 
50 per failure to a maximum of 250000

americans japanese and west europeans have 
been boosting their consumption and investment in the future during 
the 1980s but third world countries have lagged in both according 
to the world bank 
the average japanese for example used 5269 worth of goods in 
1980 and 6206 in 1987 the average for the 12 countries of the 
european economic community rose from 6127 to 6922 in the 
united states consumption rose to an average 8957 from 7609 
investment rose too that is the building of new factories and 
machinery that create more production and jobs for the future 
americans on average invested the least of the three and much of 
the money was borrowed abroad but there was an average rise from 
1918 to 2373 the european rise was smaller from 2338 to 
2432 japans increase was greater from 2994 to 3801 
no figures are given for the soviet union the central 
intelligence agency which publishes some percentages found soviet 
consumption growing slowly and even declining a bit between 1985 and 
1986 
the world bank figures appeared in the 19881989 edition of its 
world tables a 650page volume that consists largely of 
statistics the bank uses the value of the dollar in 1980 as a 
measuring stick 
the figures show that people in some third world countries 
despite low incomes and mounting debt generally managed to keep 
their consumption fairly steady though at levels that reflect deep 
poverty compared with industrial countries the average consumption 
in third world countries rose slightly from 451 in 1980 to 483 in 
1987 
behind the averages lie wide variations the value of goods 
consumed by the average chinese increased by more than half between 
1979 and 1987 but in 1987 they were still worth only 217 
in nigeria the most populous country of africa there was a 
decline from a peak of 821 in 1982 to 621 in 1987 average incomes 
of people in many poor african countries have been going down since 
they became independent of european colonial powers during the 1960s 
and 1970s consumption in those african countries rose between 1980 
and 1987 but only to an average 206 a year from 174 
there also were declines in latin america though not as great on 
average as in africa 
an ominous figure was one for lowincome africans where 
investment declined from an average of only 67 in 1974 to 38 in 
1987 that means fewer schools roads clinics factories and other 
installations are being built that could improve living standards 
and incomes for the next generation

i always knew i could dance she says i always believed in 
myself that i could do it 
now 18 and shy no longer sandra was selected by a white house 
commission as one of americas 20 most promising young artists she 
and 140 other high school seniors across the country traveled to 
washington as this years presidential scholars for their academic 
and artistic excellence 
sandra who lives with her mother in brooklyn ny will be 
graduated next tuesday from julia richman high school in manhattan 
where she took her first dance lessons four years ago in the 
schools talent unlimited arts program she will enter sarah 
lawrence college on a scholarship this fall 
greeting the presidential scholars on the white house south lawn 
the president said tuesday they were some of the best and 
brightest students in american education and had an obligation to 
help others 
while already youve done much i know you will do more and 
not for yourselves alone but for nation and neighbors bush said 
the definition of a successful life must include serving 
others that goes double for americas best he told them

activities ending today sandra who specializes in modern dance 
performed a solo she choreographed with her high school teacher 
paul thompson 
in a backstage interview before the show thompson said that as a 
freshman in his dance class sandra was so shy she couldnt even

special spirit this fire this spark he said i knew it would 
come out so i didnt push her although she was very very shy she

sister in 1986 
my family has never seen me dance she said my mother 
doesnt like it because she says you cant earn a good living at

natural talent her growth in the last four years has been 
phenomenal he said

an antismoking group says its survey of 27000 
airline passengers proves the public supports a smoking ban on short 
flights but the tobacco industry says the survey is unscientific 
the american association of respiratory care says 517 percent of 
smokers agree that the current smoking ban on flights of two hours 
or less should be made permanent the support among nonsmokers is 
911 percent the group said tuesday 
the association announced the results of its survey conducted by 
volunteers at 66 airports in 33 cities during the last week of 
april at a news conference tuesday with several house members who 
support antismoking legislation 
the airline smoking law will remain in effect until april 1990 
unless congress makes it permanent 
rep dick durbin dill said the associations survey which 
shows 84 percent overall approval of the antismoking law is solid 
evidence of the laws support and effectiveness 
even most smokers realize this law has helped improve the 
health and safety of everyone who flies said durbin 
but the tobacco institute in a news release said the poll was 
inconsistent with other data on the issue it accused the 
respiratory care association of conducting unscientific polls that 
generate selfserving questionable data 
the institute said professional polls taken when airlines were 
required to have smoking and nonsmoking areas on all flights showed 
87 percent support for that policy 
the respiratory association gave no margin of error for its poll 
but said it took steps to ensure that polltakers did not identify 
themselves as being from an antismoking group 
it said support for the smoking ban has risen 30 percent since 
the organization conducted a similar poll in 1987 
durbin said his antismoking measure would be attached to the 
transportation appropriation bill and include two amendments one 
would impose a smoking ban on all us flights if it fails the 
other would make the twohourflight ban permanent 
a house aviation subcommittee plans a hearing thursday on 
durbins measure and three other bills that would take various steps 
against smoking on airliners

taxpayers nationwide will foot the bill if a 
new york utility is granted deductions for its losses on the 
shoreham nuclear power plant a pennsylvania congressman contends 
taxpayers from alaska to florida will suffer because the 
plants owner has been granted a 28 billion tax break rep don 
ritter rpa said tuesday in denouncing plans to close the long 
island reactor 
ritter is pushing legislation to block the estimated 28 billion 
writeoff for the long island lighting co 
the internal revenue service in april approved the tax deduction 
for losses sustained as a result of scrapping the plant 
ritters measure would change the tax code to bar deductions for 
losses on the abandonment of a fully licensed nuclear plant the 
bill was referred to the house ways and means committee where 
senior new york democratic reps charles rangel and thomas downey 
could be expected to block it 
brad johnson new york gov mario cuomos washington lobbyist 
said tuesday he takes the challenge seriously but does not think the 
bill has much chance of passing 
it would be analogous to a new yorker introducing legislation 
to reopen a plant in california after ratepayers had voted to close 
it johnson added this would be a gross misuse of congressional 
power 
under a plan negotiated by cuomo and lilco shoreham would be 
sold to new york state for a symbolic dollar in exchange for a 
series of rate hikes shorehams license would be transferred to the 
long island power authority which would contract with the new york 
power authority to decommission the 55 billion plant

a narrow subcommittee vote to accept defense 
secretary dick cheneys 69 billion military purchasing budget shows 
congress is mindful of budget constraints says house armed services 
committee chairman les aspin 
would you have thought that you could have gotten the 
procurement subcommittee to vote for this a gleeful aspin 
dwis said tuesday after the procurement and military nuclear 
systems subcommittee approved his amendment by a vote of 109 
aspin who chairs both the subcommittee and the full armed 
services panel had urged his colleagues to accept cheneys 
procurement budget as is to prevent addons totaling 72 billion 
i think its a remarkable testimony to the fact that people do 
realize the budget squeeze issue said aspin 
the full house armed services committees will vote on the 
amendment next week aspin declined to give odds on the decision but 
indicated that the final vote will be close 
while the budget may not be perfect its a darn good product 
especially given the 39 days dick cheney had to put it together 
aspin told the panel 
the chairman and two other democrats ike skelton of missouri 
and richard ray of georgia joined seven of the panels eight 
republicans in approving the measure 
rep robert w davis of ohio was the lone gop member to vote 
against the plan which basically removes the right of members to 
rewrite the 300 billion fiscal 1990 budget to restore local 
projects canceled by cheney 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman said he was pleased with the vote 
but some democratic members complained that the measure amounted 
to an abdication of the subcommittees authority 
a yes vote would be abrogating ourselves out of business 
said rep frank mccloskey dind 
i think im giving up my rights if i have to vote for something 
that i can only change on the floor added rep norman sisisky 
dva 
some members have pressed for restoring the navy f14d tomcat 
fighter and marine v22 osprey which cheney canceled if restored 
the f14d would add 366 million and the v22 700 million 
other possible addons include 55 million in new equipment for 
the navy p3 antisubmarine aircraft 436 million for air force 
c130s and 240 million for heavy trucks made in oshkosh wis 
aspin said after the vote that lobbying was fierce on both sides 
with president bush and the northrop corp pushing for adoption of 
the cheney budget northrop which manufactures the b2 stealth 
bomber fears losing funds for its program to support other military 
projects 
lobbying against the plan were grumman corp builder of the

former speaker jim wright has yet to resign 
from the house but already is toying with the idea of a comeback 
saying he would consider accepting an absolutely genuine draft of 
a bipartisan nature 
i am not sure that i should consider it even then but i do 
very earnestly appreciate it the texas democrat said tuesday in a 
statement 
wright who stepped down as speaker amid an ethics investigation 
has said he will resign from the house this month but has not said 
precisely when he was replaced as speaker on may 31 by rep thomas 
s foley dwash 
over the weekend wright reportedly met in his hometown of fort 
worth with supporters who urged him to run for reelection to the 
seat in a move to gain political vindication 
naturally i am touched by the warm and gracious spirit of the 
request coming as it apparently does from a variety of different 
sources wright said i have not encouraged it the only way 
that i could even consider it at all would be if it were an 
absolutely genuine draft of a bipartisan nature 
it is impossible to forecast what the ethics committee might do 
if wright resigned and then won reelection to the house panel 
attorney mark davis said tuesday night 
wright was investigated over alleged improprieties in a book deal 
and other matters touching on his personal finances the ethics 
panel would be free to reopen the probe that drove wright from the 
speakers chair 
meanwhile texas republican chairman fred meyer said there was no 
way that wright could gain bipartisan support for reelection in 
my opinion jim wright said that he was going to resign and the 
people who elected him expect him to do that and not run 
again meyer said 
various texas politicians have been eyeing wrights seat but he 
is believed to remain highly popular in his district where some 
voters appear to believe he was treated too harshly and potential 
candidates have been reluctant to surface until he is out of the 
picture 
foley said tuesday he thought wright would be reelected if the 
former speaker ran again 
and i think that would demonstrate the strong support that 
continues to exist in his congressional district and i think the 
former speaker is very proud of that and has a right to be 
proud foley said 
its never bad for the party to have constituents expressing 
support he added 
another texas democrat rep charles stenholm said that the 
reality is that the former speaker resigned from the speakership 
and has announced that he intends to resign from the congress of 
the united states 
he added thats what the speaker has stated in a very 
emotional way to the house and to all of us who have had the 
privilege of serving with him now to find this new scenario is 
quite a shock but it is very constitutionally possible that this 
could play

president bush rattles off his address as 
pennsylvania avenue 1600 but dont count on finding him there 
if you visit the nations capital this summer 
from memorial day to labor day bush will have spent more days 
away from the white house than in it 
if bush were required to report to congress on what he did over 
the summer it would fill a substantial volume 
between lengthy trips to europe bush has been bounding about the 
country giving a string of often disjointed speeches and conducting 
the nations business on the road 
some critics have questioned whether bush in his multitudinous 
travels has been logging useful mileage or merely spinning the 
adminstrations wheels 
in the three weeks since he returned from a fournation weeklong 
trip to europe centered on a nato meeting in brussels bush 
made a 4000mile 30hour round trip to yellowstone national 
park wyomings grand tetons and lincoln neb nominally to tout 
his environmental programs however bushs lateday visit to 
yellowstone consisted of a tour of an area damaged by last years 
forest fires and was unrelated to the chief topic of the day the 
white houses new cleanair legislation 
visited a federal law enforcement training center at glynco 
ga to talk about his anticrime package the speech spotlighted a 
plan whose details had been announced several weeks before 
flew by helicopter to the philadelphia suburbs where he gave a 
high school graduation speech and shook hands with all 331 graduates 
in addition bush planned to travel today to richmond va where 
he was to speak at a motor coach exhibit at the virginia state 
fairgrounds and attend a republican fundraiser 
on thursday he travels to new york both for a fundraiser and 
to unveil details of a youth service program 
he caps next week with a visit to his family home in 
kennebunkport for a fiveday fourth of july holiday then goes to 
europe for the sevennation economic summit and side visits to 
poland hungary and the netherlands 
in august he plans a 2week vacation in kennebunkport and hes 
been spending most weeekends not otherwise accounted for at the 
presidential retreat in camp david md 
bush has been doing some business as he moves around the country 
he vetoed the minium wage bill aboard air force one as he 
traveled from montana to nebraska last week in georgia he signed a 
routine message formally transmitting his crime package to congress 
usually this would entail nothing more than a quick flourish 
of the pen and then sending an aide on a 10minute car ride up from 
pennsylvania avenue 1600 on up to capitol hill he told his 
lawenforcement audience 
but when it comes to fighting crime you deserve more than just 
business as usual 
however even in talking about crime a favored subject bush 
seemed to be sending a mixed message 
after a tough speech in which bush declared lets put the 
handcuffs on the criminals not on the criminal justice system he 
was asked by a border patrol rookie for some words of wisdom when 
we enter the field 
bush youll find that you and your colleagues will be severely 
impacted by the battle against narcotics word of wisdom would be 
an individual should be treated with respect and given his rights 
or her rights even though the evidence looks overwhelming i 
think we have to be tolerant 
the press contingent following bush as he hops from city to city 
has grown increasingly more sparse 
for the trip to philadelphia the white house canceled travel 
arrangements for the regular white house press corps beyond taking 
a small pool it cited lack of interest among news organizations 
im not going to be a policeman or try to guide your coverage 
habits its as simple as that fumed presidential press secretary

attorney general dick thornburghs plan to 
place the nations elite corps of organized crimefighting 
prosecutors under control of us attorneys is coming under fire 
from former leaders of the unit 
its impractical it just wont work philadelphia attorney 
peter f vaira said tuesday at a hearing of the house subcommittee 
on criminal justice 
under thornburghs plan prosecutors who are members of the 
20yearold organized crime strike force would no longer report to 
the justice departments criminal division instead they would be 
controlled by the politically appointed us attorneys in the cities 
were they are based 
thornburgh says the idea would end turf battles between the 
strike force and the us attorneys his critics say the elite 
force which has chalked up impressive victories in the war against 
the mob would soon vanish 
i guarantee you three years from now it will take the fbi to 
find the strike forces said vaira a former strike force chief in 
chicago and phildelphia who also was us attorney in philadelphia 
and briefly headed the presidents commission on organized crime 
edward a mcdonald former head of the strike force in brooklyn 
was sharply critical of what thornburgh and his aides call 
euphemistically the merger of the strike force i like to call it 
the destruction or the abolition of the strike force 
the plan already has sent strike force attorneys in new york 
hunting for new jobs he said adding that the departure of highly 
experienced prosecutors is likely to grow worse 
lawmakers are considering a move to bar thornburgh from 
implementing the plan until oct 1 as part of a stopgap spending 
bill likely to go to president bush and gain his signature but the 
move could go forward after that 
former new england strike force chief jeremiah t osullivan 
testified that strike force attorneys often are paid 7000 to 
10000 less than us attorneys even though they usually have more 
experience 
because of salary adjustments thornburghs plan would cost 
100000 in each city where the strike force is located osullivan 
testified 
youd be looking at an increase of 1 million right off the 
bat nationwide he said 
after all these victories i think it is fair to ask what is 
broke that needs fixing said subcommittee chairman charles 
schumer dny he said however that he would keep an open mind on 
the issue 
edward sg dennis head of the criminal division of the justice 
department told the panel that thornburghs concern for the fight 
against organized crime is second to none 
thornburgh feels strongly enough about this proposal that he is 
willing to take the heat and the controversy that this proposal 
stimulates dennis said he said the idea of merging the strike 
forces in each city with the us attorneys office was one that 
would promote even more harmony between the two groups of 
prosecutors and end turf fights 
dennis took issue with claims that the plan would mean the end of 
the strike force saying its members would not be reassigned to work 
on cases not involving organized crime 
he said turf fighting between strike force attorneys and the us 
attorneys offices has at times cut into time that should be spent on 
fighting mobsters 
the question is are we going to spend 30 percent of our time 
arguing whose case this is or are we going to make the case 
dennis said

a government proposal aimed at helping women 
minimize the risk of toxic shock syndrome is too confusing a 
consumer group says because it would allow tampon boxes to show two 
types of absorbency ratings 
the food and drug administrations revised plan would require 
manufacturers to display one of six new standardized absorbency 
rating terms ranging from low to high however they also could 
continue using traditional designations like regular and super 
this whole range system isnt as informative and clear as it 
could be said patti goldman of the public citizen health research 
group 
the proposal is an improvement over fdas earlier plan to use an 
absorbency scale of letters from a to f but theres still 
potential for confusion to have the old terms appear nearby she 
said 
the fda said tuesday it revised its earlier proposal in response 
to about 275 comments from consumers consumer groups and 
manufacturers many of whom complained that it was too confusing 
the labeling is designed to help women select the lowest 
absorbency tampon they need to reduce the risk of toxic shock 
syndrome which has been associated with tampon use toxic shock 
syndrome is rare but sometimes fatal 
under the new plan tampon absorbency would be rated as low 
medium mediumhigh high very high and highest according to the 
number of grams the tampon was designed to absorb 
tampon boxes also would have to carry labels advising women to 
select the lowest absorbency needed to minimize risk of toxic shock 
syndrome regulations have required this warning since 1982 but 
allow it to appear on a package insert 
package inserts also must list toxic shock syndromes symptoms 
sudden fever vomiting diarrhea fainting or nearly fainting when 
standing up dizziness and a sunburnlike rash 
the fda has been trying since 1981 to convince manufacturers to 
voluntarily label their products with a standardized absorbency 
rating so women could compare brandtobrand the agency gave up 
that route in 1984 and began regulatory efforts 
the fda invited public comments on the new proposal until aug 11

authorities took extra precautions against 
potential sabotage by workers at the rancho seco nuclear power 
station near sacramento calif after city residents voted to close 
the troubled plant officials disclosed 
the only incident since the june 6 vote was resolved safely but 
federal regulators said tuesday theyre keeping a close eye on plant 
conditions as the sacramento municipal utility district gradually 
switches off the reactor with a shrinking work force 
its not what youd call an unsafe situation but the unusual 
circumstances of the plant shutdown have prompted extra caution 
said thomas murley director of the nuclear regulatory commissions 
office of reactor regulation 
the vote marked the first time citizens have decided to close an 
operating reactor but analysts say it seems unlikely the move will 
trigger other closures soon still the shutdown is a blow to an 
industry already hampered by widespread public concerns about the 
safety and reliability of nuclear power 
rancho seco has a spotty record producing less than 40 percent 
of the electricity that would have resulted from unfailing 
yearround operation far below the industry average the utility 
district had to double its rates over the past four years to pay for 
plant improvements that cost more than the reactor itself 
murley said plant executives gave him explicit assurances that 
the shutdown would go smoothly and he said that so far there was no 
evidence to the contrary 
its a very tough period because all the good people will be 
looking for other jobs murley said adding that there also was a 
danger of bad reactions by plant workers to being forced out of 
the 15yearold nuclear station 
the utility districts senior nuclear executive joseph firlit 
has resigned and about 1000 regular plant workers were expected to 
leave by months end 
the nrc which is responsible for ensuring safety at the nations 
110 nuclear reactors boosted its usual complement of three resident 
inspectors at rancho seco by three or four for several days before 
and after the election greg cook a spokesman at the commisions 
regional office in walnut creek calif said tuesday 
cook said extra security inspectors also were sent to the site to 
provide aroundtheclock surveillance the nrc has returned to 
normal levels of supervision at the plant he said 
the utility increased its security at the site but has since 
trimmed it back said spokesman bert heffner he said he was not 
sure of all the reasons for the added protection but that a rush of 
news reporters to the plant was one 
edward smeloff a member of the utility districts board said in 
an interview that utility security personnel were added as a general 
precaution against possible worker backlash and because of a a 
specific incident with one disgruntled employee 
an offduty reactor operator angered at the prospect of losing 
his job telephoned the plant the day after the election to say he 
would not shut it down if so ordered said smeloff 
heffner said the incident did not constitute a threat to 
security but the workers access to the plant was suspended he 
said no decision has been made on possible disciplinary action 
against the man whose name was not disclosed 
dean kunihiro an official at the nrcs walnut creek office said 
that while its kind of business as usual again at rancho seco 
the commission is still watchful because a serious accident 
involving radioactive release is still possible even though the 
reactor is no longer sustaining a chain reaction 
the plant owner is planning to remove the fuel rods from the 
reactor vessel in august but has not yet decided whether it will 
continue with the lengthy process of dismantling the plant or try to 
sell it to another potential operator

a chinese governmentsponsored art show was 
launched for yearlong showings in the united states on schedule and 
without incident but also without official chinese representation 
wang yani a 14yearold prodigy who has made 10000 
brushandink paintings since she was 3 years old was the 
undisputed star at the preview of her exhibition of 69 colorful 
pictures 
in a demonstration lasting barely an hour she created a 70th 
painting dashing barefoot brush in hand from end to end of a 3by 
6foot parchment laid on a floor 
her works show monkeys birds and other beasts displaying human 
emotions and expressions while cavorting through exquisitely drawn 
foliage and mountains of yanis rugged native guangxi province in 
south china far from the turmoil of beijing and shanghai 
chinas ministry of culture is listed as sponsor of the 
exhibition but no one from the chinese embassy appeared at tuesdays 
event maybe because they were too busy said milo beach 
director of the smithsonian insitutions sackler gallery for asian 
art 
at the very hour of the preview congress members critical of 
chinas violent crackdown against the prodemocracy movement rallied 
at the nearby us capitol grounds then went to the chinese embassy 
to protest killings violence and arrests in what they described as 
a confrontational meeting with ambassador han xu 
the day after demonstrators were shot down in beijings tiananmen 
square the us national academy of sciences suspended official 
scientific exchanges with the chinese academy in protest but no 
moves have been reported to suspend cultural exchanges 
wang yanis works have been shown in japan and europe and the 
us exhibition was first proposed four years ago said marc wilson 
director of the nelsonatkins museum in kansas city mo which took 
the lead in organizing it it is scheduled to move there dec 16 and 
on to san franciscos asian art museum next march 
pictures for the exhibit were sent here months ago and there was 
no thought of changing plans only hope that yani would appear 
sackler officials said she flew here with her father via beijing 
last weekend and plans to return next week said susan bliss 
spokeswoman for the us governmentsupported gallery we see this 
is a cultural event and apparently not a problem she said 
the exhibitions official catalog however treats yani as a 
symbol of the liberalization in china that is now under threat it 
says the cultural revolution during the last decade of mao zedongs 
rule ruthlessly suppressed many of chinas greatest artists and 
artistic traditions in the name of revolutionary culture 
public recognition and appreciation of wang yanis remarkable 
talent may only have been possible because of the gradual loosening 
of government controls over art that followed maos death it 
adds the paintings of a child who knew nothing of politics 
offered a fresh vision that many artists sought in their own work 
this is reflected in the title of the exhibition yani the 
brush of innocence

a district of columbia government office 
violated city purchasing laws in a joint personnel project with the 
virgin islands government according to a draft report on a probe 
into the project 
the washington post reported today the preliminary report showed 
that the office of personnel project cost the city at least 
258645 or nearly twice as much as the 144786 in reimbursement 
now being sought by the city 
it appears to the committee that this project was a rogue 
operation that operated outside the normal lines of authority and 
outside the safeguards for the expenditure of public funds said 
the draft report on the district councils investigation 
a federal grand jury is investigating the project in which the 
district helped revamp the island governments personnel system and 
draft new laws 
virgin islands gov alexander a farrelly and district mayor 
marion barry conceived the project which was jointly supervised by 
former district personnel director theodore e thornton sr and 
charles lewis a former aide to farrelly lewis later was convicted 
on drug charges in the virgin islands 
inspector james richard of the us interior deparment has said 
some dc officials used the project as an excuse to party in st 
thomas at public expense 
the draft report said thornton failed to get a written agreement 
from the virgin islands government covering the projects 
activities and that costs were allowed to escalate despite 
indications of serious administrative and financial problems 
the report cited testimony by oscar mays chief of budget and 
financial management for the office of personnel that he was 
ordered by a superior to ignore purchasing requirements in hiring 
two consultants

the battle over president bushs choice of 
donald p gregg as ambassador to south korea moves to the full 
senate after a favorable committee vote reflecting sharp 
disagreement on whether he lied about playing a role in the 
irancontra affair 
gregg has repeatedly denied under oath that he was involved in 
oliver norths secret operation to resupply the nicaraguan contra 
rebels while serving as national security adviser to thenvice 
president george bush 
sen alan cranston dcalif who spearheaded the lengthy probe 
by the foreign relations committees democratic majority into 
greggs alleged links to the operation said he had not decided how 
hard to press the matter on the senate floor 
but greggs nomination appeared to have been given a solid boost 
by the decision of three committee democrats to join nine 
republicans in recommending approval the committee voted 127 on 
tuesday to send the nomination to the senate floor 
the senate is not likely to act before it returns from its 
independence day recess on july 10 
sen mitch mcconnell rky who at one point organized a gop 
boycott of a panel meeting in order to force action on greggs 
nomination called the panels decision a very big victory 
particularly because of cranstons very large expenditure of 
energy and political capital 
picking up three democrats is very helpful in assuring 
greggs eventual confirmation mcconnell said 
earlier mcconnell told the committee the president of the 
united states is loyal but he is not foolish if he had determined 
that gregg was not truthful he would not have submitted this 
nomination 
democrats voting to recommend confirmation of gregg were chairman 
claiborne pell dri and sens charles robb of virginia and terry 
sanford of north carolina 
in explaining his vote pell said he concluded that mr gregg 
and the president should be given the benefit of the doubt despite 
the excellent arguments made by cranston 
robb said he closely examined the evidence and found greggs 
explanations to be as reasonable and believable as i think we 
could expect under the circumstances 
gregg is a retired career veteran of the central intelligence 
committee who served as cia station chief in seoul sen paul simon 
dill said he voted against the nomination not because he believed 
gregg lacked credibility but because he is concerned that his cia 
background will make him a political target in south korea 
addressing the committee moments before the vote cranston said 
the nomination should be rejected on the grounds of both 
credibility and judgment 
we are being asked to reward a man many of us do not believe 
has been straight with us while under oath cranston said we 
are being asked to promote a man to a crucial diplomatic post whose 
judgment by his own admission has been so flawed that he twice 
offered to resign from thenvice president bushs staff 
cranston denied he was making a purely partisan effort to harm 
bush as mcconnell and some other republicans have charged 
he said he remains highly skeptical that gregg was never told by 
his close friend and former cia colleague felix rodriguez that 
rodriguez was recruited by north to help resupply the contras with 
military aid at a time when congress had forbidden such activities 
during two separate appearances before the committee both times 
under oath gregg said he was unaware that rodriguez was doing 
anything more than helping the government of el salvador put down 
the leftwing insurgency against it the mission for which he was 
sent to central america 
cranston made clear he does not believe greggs story that 
although rodriguez told him some of the details of the contra 
resupply mission in august 1986 he did not put the pieces together 
until the following december 
our hearings revealed documents making clear that rodriguez and 
north were working together in an illegal contra resupply scheme 
months earlier from january 1985 the same week gregg introduced 
rodriguez to bush cranston said 
i recognize how difficult it is for some senators to state the 
conclusion most of us share mr gregg has not been straight with 
us cranston said the implications for mr gregg and for the 
president are not pleasant 
the panel also postponed action on three other nominations after 
democrats complained that the nominees only visible qualifications 
were large gop contributions 
sen paul sarbanes dmd initiated the delay when he complained 
that us ambassadors should have at least some qualifications 
the three include 
</TEXT>

joseph zappala a florida land developer and national 
cochairman of bushs fund raising committee who has been nominated 
to be us ambassador to spain sarbanes said he contributed

named to be ambassador to australia sarbanes said sembler was a

della newman a seattle wash residential real estate broker 
who has been nominated to be ambassador to new zealand she is a 
longtime personal friend of bush and was chairman of the washington

apparent qualifications except her personal and political ties

an irate william hurt refused to answer questions 
after the actor accused his former lovers lawyer of insulting him 
and his 6yearold son during a courtroom shouting match 
after the exchange sandra jennings testified that the 
39yearold oscarwinning actor introduced her to several people as 
his wife hurt testified monday and tuesday that he never did so 
ms jennings trying to prove that their threeyear relationship 
constituted a commonlaw marriage is suing for half of what hurt 
earned during the time they lived together 
the trial was scheduled to resume this afternoon 
the confrontation tuesday arose while plaintiff attorney a 
richard golub questioned hurt about his relationship with jennings 
the mother of the actors son alexander 
golub exasperated by hurts answers and by frequent objections 
by defense lawyer martin shelton complained to state justice 
jacqueline silbermann that shelton was interrupting my rhythm and 
rhythm is everything 
as golub tried to resume questioning after a spate of sheltons 
objections hurt who had been combative and evasive in 1 days of 
testimony quipped to the lawyer get your rhythm right 
golub replied you had yours right pal when you had alex 
didnt you 
hurt asked the judge you can permit that 
the judge hearing the case without a jury said objection 
sustained and told golub to stick to the issues golub tried to 
resume questioning 
im blocked hurt told the lawyer what you just said is an 
insult to me you understand ok i cant hear anything else 
the judge ordered a 10minute recess 
jennings a 32yearold former ballerina testified that hurt 
introduced her as his wife to people they met in beaufort sc 
where he was shooting the big chill in late 1982 she

helping them find a place to live

federal police have arrested a former national 
security agent and onetime movie actor on suspicion he was the 
triggerman in the 1984 murder of leading newspaper columnist manuel 
buendia authorities said 
the mexico city attorney generals office identified the suspect 
as juan rafael mora avila 36 a member of a prominent family of 
politicians from the neighboring state of puebla 
jose antonio zorrilla perez former director of a nowdissolved 
equivalent of the fbi was arrested june 13 in mexico city for 
allegedly masterminding the murder and is awaiting trial on charges 
of homicide 
buendia whose frontpage column in the newspaper excelsior 
exposed wrongdoing in high places was shot to death on may 30 
1984 at the entrance of a parking garage after leaving his office 
the attorney generals office says it has evidence zorrilla 47 
ordered the killing of buendia whom he had known for 15 years when 
he learned the columnist planned to expose his links to prominent 
drug traffickers 
the office said mora was arrested tuesday and booked on 
suspicion of being one of the material authors in the slaying of 
buendia a police source who insisted on anonymity said 
authorities had evidence indicating mora was the triggerman 
under mexican law mora must be arraigned within 24 hours or the 
case will be thrown out for lack of evidence 
the attorney generals office said mora when questioned by a 
city prosecutor denied he had anything to do with the shooting 
saying when i arrived he buendia was already dead

actor in at least four horror and crime movies he is still a member 
anda the national actors association 
zorrilla was director of the federal security administration from

shot conducted the preliminary investigation in the case he has 
also been indicted on charges of obstructing justice and abuse of

warner communications says paramounts 
multibilliondollar attempt to buy time inc violates the 1984 cable 
act and federal communications commission rules 
but lawyers for paramount communications which launched a 107 
billion hostile tender offer for time after time announced a 
proposed 18 billion merger with warner told the fcc on tuesday it 
should set aside its previous ruling allowing time to transfer 
control of its cable tv systems to timewarner 
paramount said time had misrepresented to its stockholders the 
nature of the transfer and that time had written to state attorneys 
general asking them to oppose paramounts proposal without notifying 
paramount of the letters 
these actions raise questions about times character 
qualifications paramount said asking the fcc to set aside its 
approval of the license transfers pending an investigation 
the filings were the latest round of highstakes corporate 
manuevering in which the three parties are trying to create the 
worlds largest entertainment and media conglomerate 
after the timewarner merger was announced in march paramount 
weighed in with its hostile takeover offer but time fired back 
friday with a 126 billion offer to buy warner 
besides the tussle over transfer of cable licenses the battle is 
expected to be waged in court in delaware where all three companies 
are incorporated 
paramount earlier this month asked the fcc for permission to give 
control of time to former defense secretary donald rumsfeld pending 
fcc approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and 
licenses held by times 82percentowned subsidiary american 
television and communications corp 
art harding a lawyer for warner said tuesday that paramounts 
request would violate the recent cable act because rumsfeld hasnt 
gotten consent from any of these cities for the transfers 
harding echoing assertions time made against paramount in a june 
13 fcc filing said paramounts plan would undermine the delicate 
balance established in the 1984 cable act for regulation of cable 
systems by local authorities 
warner asked the fcc late monday to deny the application made by 
paramount and its subsidiary kds acquisition corp for expedited 
consent to transfer control of time to rumsfeld and then to 
paramount 
warner said paramounts plan called for an unprecedented 
extension to the cable tv industry of fcc rules that cover hostile 
tender offers for broadcast licenses it said the fcc can allow 
transfer of a broadcaster even before it decides the receiving party 
is qualified to hold broadcast licenses but cable franchises must 
be transferred by local authorities and the fcc has no say

a technician who apparently contracted a 
rare form of herpes from a laboratory monkeys bite has died and 21 
coworkers are at significant risk of infection officials say 
the technician whose name was withheld was infected with herpes 
b virus also known as monkey herpes it attacks the brain and 
nervous system and kills more than 70 percent of people who catch 
it scientists say 
the 23yearold victim an employee of international research and 
development corp in mattawan about 10 miles west of kalamazoo 
died tuesday afternoon at bronson methodist hospital said hospital 
spokesman bill russell 
authorities have tested 110 people who worked at the lab or had 
contact with the victim said dr william hall of the state 
department of public health he said 21 employees have significant 
risk of catching the disease because monkeys have bitten or 
scratched them 
james webb a spokesman for the company said the bite was not 
immediately reported 
we are deeply saddened by the loss of an employee from the 
extremely rare b virus and are further saddened that this unreported 
incident did not allow preventive measures to be taken that could 
have spared his life he said 
webb said guidelines for handling such bites and scratches are 
established by the us centers for disease control 
the disease is common among old world monkeys which can spread 
it through bites or scratches when it is in the active phase 
test results are pending on the 21 people who will require 
retesting in three to four weeks because of the diseases incubation 
period hall said 
there have been 30 cases of monkey herpes among humans reported 
in the united states since 1932 said hall only one of those cases 
was spread by humantohuman contact

pat swindall eight months ago a congressman and 
one day ago a senate hopeful now stands convicted of lying to a 
grand jury investigating a drugrelated money laundering sting 
obviously im very disappointed said the 38yearold 
conservative republican who lost reelection in november following 
his perjury indictment 
he was convicted tuesday of all nine counts and faces a possible 
10 months to five years in prison and 250000 fine on each count 
sentencing was scheduled for aug 25 
probation is not an option under new federal sentencing 
guidelines which swindall supported as a congressman 
swindall who spent two terms representing atlantas eastern 
suburbs had hoped for an acquittal and a 1990 race against sen sam 
nunn dga now barring a victory on appeal he will go to prison 
after his aug 25 sentencing 
swindall sat impassively in the federal courtroom as the jury 
announced its verdict on the 22nd day of his trial his wife kim 
rested her hand on his back 
i could have understood one or two counts but i just dont 
understand this he told companions as he headed to a probation 
office 
later he told reporters he would appeal 
this process is not over he said well be trying this 
case again and i hope not in atlanta 
swindalls attorneys asked before and during the trial for his 
case to be moved because of pretrial publicity 
he said he had gotten involved in something i never should have 
gotten involved in but ive said i had been 100 percent truthful 
before the grand jury that hasnt changed 
swindall who went to congress in 1984 was defeated in november 
by democrat ben jones a former tv actor in the dukes of 
hazzard while under the cloud of the perjury indictment 
swindall was accused of lying to a federal grand jury in his feb 
2 1988 testimony concerning his monthlong 1987 negotiations with 
an undercover internal revenue service agent and with a swindall 
supporter later convicted of money laundering the irs agent was 
posing as a drugmoney launderer 
the government said swindall was seeking 850000 to complete 
construction on his luxurious suburban home the money was to be 
funneled to swindall through a mortgage company created by his 
friend and political supporter charles lechasney authorities said 
swindall had been accused of 10 counts that said he made 20 false 
statements to the grand jury the judge dropped one count and the 
jurors tuesday found 18 to be willful lies 
specifically they found that he lied when he said he didnt 
recall being told the money included narcotics dollars when he said 
he never agreed to accept the money and when he said a 150000 
check he received but later returned had nothing to do with the 
deal 
to me this is among the most important if not the most 
important case weve handled said us attorney robert barr he 
noted that swindall as a congressman not only swore to uphold the 
laws but helped make them 
even people at that high level of public life must be held 
accountable for their misdeeds barr said 
swindall a lawyer said the trial included at least two very 
reversible errors which he hopes will win him a new trial 
freemans dismissal of the testimony of rep barney frank dmass 
that house members have an overwhelming workload and a prosecutors 
remark concerning the possible motivation of defendants to testify 
during criminal trials 
swindall did not testify in his own defense 
neither area however directly addressed the bulk of the case 
hours of secretly taperecorded conversations between swindall 
lechasney and irs undercover agent michael mullaney 
in those tapes heard by the jury swindall was told the money he 
was seeking certainly included drug money was told he would be 
part of an operation to wash cash and proposed that a mortgage 
company be set up as a buffer to funnel him the money the deal 
eventually collapsed 
swindall said he is considering a number of different career 
options one of those ive got to put into the blend is a prison 
ministry 
i will go where god sends me god doesnt make mistakes 
the lanky boyishlooking swindall won his house seat in a 1984 
upset in his two terms he staunchly voted with the reagan right

the government today said exports rose slightly in 
may while imports soared a situation reflecting chinas recent 
economic and political turmoil 
according to customs authorities china exported 443 billion of 
goods in may up 08 percent over the same month in 1988 
imports were up 211 percent to 531 billion in the same period 
the official xinhua news agency reported today 
the customs figures showed exports for the first five months of 
the year were up 47 percent to 18 billion while imports jumped 
244 percent to 2267 billion a trade imbalance of 46 billion 
that was 38 billion more than the first five months of 1988 
the report did not cite reasons for the worsening trade situation 
however the nation is suffering from increasingly serious 
shortages of raw materials and energy and has had to divert some 
important export items such as coal and oil to the domestic market 
while importing more raw materials for its processing industries 
politically beijing was hit in may by the prodemocracy student 
demonstrations that disrupted some factory production and distracted 
the national leadership 
the trade situation is expected to worsen in june when the 
military killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in beijing triggering 
unrest throughout the nation

of the hill and takes his place amid machinery idled by a wildcat 
strike 
when his neighbor junie dials tries to reach the same island 
creek corp mine at the start of his evening shift he gets no 
further than the pickets and retreats to buddys carryout in nearby 
accoville 
its a script they expect to follow as long as wildcat strikes in 
10 states continue against coal companies including the island 
creek mine here in southern west virginia about 50 miles south of 
charleston

had no trouble with the strikers after telling them he is a 
supervisor beyond that he has been instructed not to talk 
i cant even tell you my name is ronnie gibson he said in 
the quiet office of the island creek mine 
at accoville where he grew up with gibson dials looks 
exasperated when he leans on buddys shining lunch counter

today dials said referring to a federal judge i was tickled 
to death about it i thought they were going to let me go back to 
work

police today arrested at least 170 
hippies who they said tried to enter the grounds of the 
4000yearold stonehenge monument before dawn to celebrate the 
summer solstice 
six people managed to scale a fence on the perimeter of the famed 
archaeological site before they were detained and one of them 
shouted to reporters free the stones free the people 
wiltshire police said they had warned about 300 people gathered 
on a highway near the monument to disperse or face arrest for 
breaking a ban on processions within a 4mile radius of stonehenge 
the police numbering about 800 later moved in on the crowd 
making arrests on the highway and in and around amesbury a village 
2 miles from stonehenge 
stonehenge is a mysterious double circle of gigantic standing 
stones set in salisbury plain about 80 miles southwest of london it 
is thought to have been a center for prechristian and astronomical 
worship because the sun rises over a particular stone 
most arrests were made for breaches of the public order act 
banning processions within the exclusion zone police said 
violators faced a maximum threemonth prison sentence 
police denied access to modernday druid sun worshipers who in 
previous years have celebrated the summer solstice the longest day 
of the year in the northern hemisphere with a ritual sunrise 
ceremony at stonehenge 
about a dozen youths who evaded roadblocks and tried to reach the 
site under cover of darkness were arrested as they crossed fields 
police closed all roads to the public and dozens of officers 
protected by visors patrolled on horses 
our aim was to avoid confrontation and violence and we have 
achieved that said wiltshire deputy police superintendent allan 
elliott our second aim was to make sure an illegal festival was 
not established and that also has been achieved the runup to the 
solstice was very quiet this year 
about 2000 of the hippies gathered for a music festival on 
specially allocated farmland in somerset 40 miles away 
in the past the hippies have held loosely organized music 
festivals at stonehenge coinciding with the solstice when the sun 
reaches its greatest distance from the equator 
the festivals held since the early 1970s have been banned 
since 1985 because of complaints of drugtaking and property damage

a black man who insisted he was unjustly 
convicted by an allwhite jury was executed in the gas chamber early 
today for a fiveday robbery spree in which three people were slain 
leo edwards jr 36 of new orleans appeared to gasp for breath 
and shrug his shoulders several times as the cyanide gas swirled 
around him 
he was declared dead at 1215 am minutes after being strapped 
into a chair in the gas chamber 
edwards was the fourth person executed at the state penitentiary 
at parchman and the 113th in the nation since the us supreme court 
reinstated the death penalty in 1976 
edwards was executed for the june 14 1980 shooting death of 
jackson convenience store clerk linzy don dixon the robbery netted 
111 and came during a spree in hinds and madison counties in which 
two other people were killed and two were wounded 
also participating in the spree was mike white who escaped with 
edwards from the louisiana state penitentiary at angola 
white is serving two life terms after pleading guilty to murder 
in the death of dixon and a bar owner 
defense attorneys protested that prosecutors deliberately 
excluded blacks from the jury denying edwards a fair trial 
on tuesday the us supreme court voted 72 against a stay and 
gov ray mabus rejected edwards plea for clemency 
i will not stand in the way of the courts justice leo 
edwards is a mass murderer who killed in cold blood mabus said 
he tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the courts and 
discrimination had no bearing in his case 
leo edwards sentence is a result of his own crime and his 
fate now rests in gods hands the governor said 
but in a newspaper interview published tuesday edwards 
maintained his innocence and insisted he did not receive a fair 
trial even though four different appeals courts rejected arguments 
that prosecutors deliberately excluded blacks from the jury 
you know how i felt when i saw the allwhite jury edwards 
was quoted as saying i said im dead

a 3monthold boy with severe burns was the first 
beneficiary of dennis genzs decision to donate 4 square feet of his 
excess skin to a hospital burn unit 
genz diet recently allowed him to shed 170 pounds but left him 
with a large flap of skin on his abdomen which was removed 
surgically monday 
there have been rare cases where parents have donated skin for 
their children betty perls education director for the regional 
organ bank of illinois said tuesday but none of us have ever 
heard of a case like this 
the 5foot11 genz weighed 430 pounds last august when he began a 
highprotein weightloss regimen last week he weighed in at 260 
he said the operation removed 19 pounds of skin and adjoining 
tissue 
some of the skin went to dexter moore a 3monthold victim of a 
fire in indiana 
when the infant was admitted he was suffering from smoke 
inhalation and burns to his face head and arms it was a 
lifethreatening situation said john easton spokesman at the 
university of chicago medical center 
now said easton hes doing well 
more lives are saved by skin transplants than any other donated 
organ said dr lawrence gottlieb professor of surgery and director 
of the hospitals burn unit 
most donated skin comes from cadavers ms perls said 
donated skin is used as a kind of living bandage while the 
patient regenerates his own skin ms perls said then the borrowed 
tissue is shed 
because its use is temporary skin used for burn patients need 
not be a perfect match like that used for skin grafts or other organ 
transplants ms perls said 
genz a 43yearold equipment coordinator for the emergency 
department at sherman hospital in elgin said the idea for donating 
the skin came while he was eating lunch with some nurses 
we were joking that it was too bad i couldnt donate the 
skin he said 
then one of the nurses said why not he recalled tuesday 
from his hospital bed where he was recovering from mondays surgery 
the decision left me with a good feeling genz said adding 
he was feeling fine despite kind of a big scar

harcourt brace jovanovich trying to keep 
its head above 26 billion in debt has gone fishing for a new 
owner for shamu the killer whale and its sea world theme parks 
the orlandobased publishing and entertainment giant also put up 
for sale two other central florida attractions boardwalk amp baseball 
and cypress gardens plus all land holdings estimates of the worth 
of the package ranged from 15 billion to 25 billion 
we know most every employee in the parks hbjs longtime 
chairman william jovanovich told reporters tuesday and it hurts 
a little bit to think that youre going to say goodbye to part of 
your family but were not going to do it unless its done rightly 
financial analysts say the sale of the parks will help beef up a 
balance sheet weakened by huge debts acquired to repel an unfriendly 
takeover attempt by british publisher robert maxwell to counter 
maxwells unsolicited bid of 2 billion in may 1987 harcourt 
adopted a takeover defense that weighed it down with in debt 
hbj is about 26 billion in debt and has a deficit of 15 
billion in stockholder equity so this is a positive development 
for the company said robert dunlap of brown brothers harriman amp 
co in new york 
harcourt was the secondmost active issue on the new york stock 
exchange on tuesday following the morning announcement with 375 
million shares changing hands the stock rose 375 to close tuesday 
at 13875 
during the past two years harcourt has disposed of 
trademagazine and schoolsupply interests streamlined its theme 
parks division and reshuffled its publishing operations all of 
which included huge reductions in personnel 
but that wasnt enough according to some analysts who had 
foreseen the sale of an entire operating division as the only way to 
pay off the debt 
the first love of this company is publishing said elizabeth 
bramwell of the brokerage gabelli amp co in new york they 
shouldnt have been doing all these other things 
the marine parks are in orlando san diego san antonio and 
aurora ohio near cleveland shamu is the stage name given to the 
performing whales at the parks the land for sale is about 1000 
acres in florida and san antonio 
hbj the nations largest textbook publisher lost 1265 
million or 204 a share last year compared with a 1987 profit of 
644 million or 134 a share

the state is looking for ways to keep its 
high school achievement tests under wraps after it was forced to 
cancel an exam when the answers were published in the new york post 
the newspaper saying it was showing that illicitly obtained 
tests were widely available published the answer sheet to a 
chemistry test tuesday the day it was to be given to an estimated 
80000 students across the state 
officials probing the theft of the test results have found the 
exams were widely available to students in new york city said 
education commissioner thomas sobol tests in biology math french 
and global studies also were reported to be available he said 
we are considering several measures which will improve our 
security in the future sobol said 
thomas gilles a spokesman for the state attorney general said 
the office was investigating reports the tests and results were 
being sold for 2000 although some tests were available for as 
little as 5 or 10 the night before the exam 
the regents tests given in 17 subjects over a oneweek period in 
late june are taken by high school students and generally account 
for a portion of a students grade 
after the post published the chemistry answers they were quickly 
distributed through copy and fax machines across the state forcing 
only the second cancelation in the tests history 
jerry nachman editor of the post said it took a reporter 15 
minutes to find a copy of a test after he was assigned to check 
reports they were stolen 
he said the test results were published on the front page as a 
service to students who were planning to take the exam legitimately 
when there was so much cheating going on 
their inability to recognize the ingenuity of teenagers 
coupled with the proliferation of photocopiers and fax machines was 
silly nachman said 
sobol said the department believed it could contain the damage to 
new york city and that the tests could have been given elsewhere in 
the state on tuesday but several hours after the newspaper was 
published it became clear this was impossible he said 
the education department is considering suing the post for the 
cost of preparing and giving a replacement test said sobols 
spokeswoman linda fisher she estimated those costs at 250000 
if they want to sue us fine nachman said i think the 
discovery will be very revealing to us and all our colleagues in the 
press 
in plattsburgh near the canadian border plattsburgh high school 
junior katie king said she was relieved but the cancellation left a 
nagging doubt 
in a way im curious what i would have gotten on the regents 
in a way im kind of disappointed she said

authorities detained burmas main 
opposition leader aung san suu kyi while she was laying wreaths 
today to honor demonstrators killed a year ago by the military 
official sources said 
she and the 15 followers rounded up with her were released after 
an hourlong interrogation said the sources who asked for 
anonymity 
witnesses said aung san suu kyi and the others were taken away in 
open military trucks to a government office near where the ceremony 
took place 
no official statement has been made about the incident at 
myeinigon four miles north of downtown rangoon 
aung san suu kyi the daughter of deceased national hero gen 
aung san held a religious ceremony with her followers at a branch 
office of her national league for democracy and then walked to the 
spot where several demonstrators were shot by police last june 21 
several hundred people were present at the wreathlaying when 
authorities moved in 
in recent months aung san suu kyi has been harassed on occasion 
but generally been given considerable leeway by the military 
government to campaign throughout the country 
aung san suu kyi a charismatic 44yearold political neophyte 
is widely regarded as the most powerful opposition figure in burma 
and her party appears to have the biggest backing among the 200odd 
parties that have mushroomed 
she returned to rangoon from london her home for many years to 
look after her ailing mother in april 1988 and became embroiled in 
the political turmoil sweeping burma 
she became one of the main leaders of a prodemocracy uprising 
that seemed on the verge of toppling 26 years of authoritarian rule 
through massive street demonstrations 
but last september gen saw maung and a group of military 
officers brutally crushed the studentled protests and clamped 
martial law on the country 
the new leaders allowed the formation of opposition political 
parties and have promised free general elections next year but 
opponents like aung san suu kyi have remained skeptical about the 
balloting 
aung san suu kyi joined with two popular leaders retired brig 
gen aung gyi and onetime defense minister tin oo to form the league 
of which she is general secretary and tin oo president aung gyi 
later left the group claiming the league was being infiltrated by 
communists

traffic jams started at dawn today in london as 
commuters contended with oneday strikes by rail bus and subway 
workers over pay and working conditions 
by 6 am the traffic buildup was what it is usually like at 8 
am said a scotland yard spokesman many city parking lots were 
full by 630 am 
perhaps because of the early start the automobile association 
reported the usual jams on the sixlane m25 motorway that circles 
the city were no worse than usual 
the strike by 75000 railroad workers was the first national rail 
strike since 1982 
london had the worst problems because of a strike called tuesday 
night by 18500 bus workers to coincide with the strike by the 
capitals 10500 subway workers the subway strike was the seventh 
unofficial 24hour walkout in 11 weeks in london 
londons red doubledecker buses and sprawling subway network 
carry more than 3 million passengers daily while british rail 
carries 2 million passengers a day 
i saw a car with three bikes on the roof two in the back and 
five people in the car i guess they just drive as far as they can 
and get on their bikes said patrick gilligan of london bicycle co 
barclays bank and the midland bank hired buses and organized 
pickup points to get their employees to work some companies hired 
taxis or booked hotel rooms in central london 
the chances of getting a hotel room near the financial 
district now are very very slim said stephen kaye managing 
director of room center uk a hotel booking agency 
the royal mail warned of delays in first and secondclass mail 
and all time off for london police was suspended 
the independent a london daily ran a frontpage cartoon today 
showing a man holding a briefcase and addressing his tearful family 
im just going to work i may be gone some time 
at gatwick airport british airways chartered 27 buses to help 
make up for the lack of rail service which normally carries about 
24000 airline passengers and employees daily 
no serious traffic congestion was reported glasgow britains 
secondlargest city where subway service was not affected 
police in liverpool reported no unusual problems 
 
in parliament on tuesday prime minister margaret thatcher 
condemned the strikers for a typically selfish policy to put 
themselves first deliberately causing massive inconvenience to 
those who have to work 
earlier the court of appeal refused a request by british rail to 
block the planned walkout 
union members voted 29675 to 20704 to strike over british 
rails proposed 7 percent wage increase and plans to abolish 
national wage bargaining 
british rail which says the strike will cost it 155 million 
offered to return to the negotiating table and urged staff to ignore 
the strike call 
when subway workers decided tuesday to go ahead with their 
stoppage over pay and work conditions delegates representing bus 
workers in the transport and general workers union decided on a 
24hour strike to demand a 14 percent pay rise 
they rejected an offer of 8 percent to 9 percent which london 
buses said was roughly in line with inflation now 83 percent 
annually the company said a bus driver operating without a 
conductor earns 340 a week 
the dispute between london underground and workers on the 
248station subway involves trains now operated only by drivers 
drivers want a 99 weekly increase to operate without a guard 
management is offering 46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation 
but is tying the raise to increased productivity

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev told the 
chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff today that his visit was 
evidence the superpowers are viewing each other more as partners 
than adversaries 
gorbachev met adm william j crowe in a kremlin office on the 
last day of a 10day visit in which crowe viewed military exercises 
in byelorussia looked at a soviet nuclear submarine and traveled 
widely in the soviet union 
the very fact that you have visited the soviet union and have 
visited military facilities and units demonstrates that we are 
moving from the notion of enemies to the notion of partners 
gorbachev told crowe in the presence of a handful of reporters 
i believe that in the plans made by the joint chiefs of staff 
we are still considered to be adversaries but the process is going 
along new lines and this is extremely significant the president 
said 
crowe accompanied by us ambassador jack matlock then met with 
gorbachev his military adviser marshal sergei f akhromeyev and 
military chief of staff mikhail a moiseyev for about an hour 
obviously there still are differences in our points of view 
especially on arms control crowe said at a news conference later 
but he added the atmosphere for discussing them has improved 
markedly 
i believe we now have an environment in which we can talk 
candidly ask the kinds of questions that are important we can talk 
without rancor or emotion he said 
crowes visit followed a trip by akhromeyev to the united states 
he is to leave moscow early thursday 
the visit came as the united states and soviet union resumed 
talks in geneva on reducing their arsenals of strategic nuclear 
missiles negotiations that were stalled by disagreements and the 
change of us administrations 
the two sides also are engaged in negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear weapons chemical weapons and conventional forces in europe 
crowe spent much of his visit assessing changes in soviet 
military policy under gorbachev the policy is based on the concept 
of reasonable sufficiency that the country only needs enough 
soldiers and military hardware to defend itself 
gorbachev has said the nation needs to redirect resources from 
the military to satisfy pentup domestic demand for food and 
consumer goods 
crowe told a moscow military academy last week that the soviet 
union still has overwhelming numbers and that he assumes it 
might attack 
but he also said the soviet union must be given time to make good 
on promises to cut the size of its armed forces by 500000 soldiers 
take 500 nuclear weapons out of eastern europe and withdraw tanks 
and artillery 
there is change afoot in this country politically and 
militarily crow said today adding that he found gorbachev very 
impressive 
crowe said gorbachevs plan to withdraw 500 tactical nuclear 
weapons from eastern europe and president bushs proposals on 
reducing conventional forces made him optimistic about superpower 
arms talks 
we now believe there are some positive offers some 
constructive offers on the table that both sides are serious and 
sincere and that we can now continue the process of negotiations and 
some optimism crowe said 
but he said that it is dangerous for arms control negotiators to 
be rushed by a desire on both sides for disarmament

brewery employees drove a jittery vietnam 
veteran over the edge by making sudden loud noises so they could 
watch him throw himself to the floor a panel ruled in awarding him 
86000 in workers compensation 
this is a case where the human insensitivity often witnessed in 
the childrens schoolyard has reappeared in the adult workplace 
two administrative law judges wrote in a decision in favor of john 
e beverly 42 of waterloo 
such callous behavior is not merely reprehensible but a 
disgrace 
coworkers at miller brewing co learned he had been diagnosed as 
suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder including an 
exaggerated startle reaction and preyed upon this startle 
reaction apparently for amusement or perhaps outright cruelty 
said judges randall r kaiser and nancy l schneiders 
from 1981 to 1983 coworkers dropped tables broke beer bottles 
dropped heavy equipment from forklifts popped empty milk cartons 
and paper cups and set off fireworks 
beverly responded with a flash of fear and an increased heart 
rate and jumped or threw himself to the floor 
a rocket set off in the lunchroom in beverlys direction so 
unnerved him that he was hospitalized for seven months for 
psychiatric treatment the judges said last week 
beverly who left his job as a production worker in 1983 and 
never returned suffers chronic anxiety distrust of other people 
depression anxiety attacks and nightmares the judges found 
miller and its insurance companies said the harassment or 
horseplay was not directed at beverly or if it was it was not 
unusual stress they also said his posttraumatic stress disorder 
resulted from combat not what occurred at work 
but the judges ruled that the campaign of terror and 
harassment was outoftheordinary stress and noted that six 
psychiatrists and six psychologist found that beverlys current 
problems resulted from harassment 
his lawyer arthur heitzer said tuesday that beverly had not 
worked since leaving miller 
the brewer and its insurers have three weeks to appeal 
miller spokesman peter acly said the company was reviewing the 
decision

the us justice department has sued a suburb for 
denying a zoning permit for a home for retarded adults 
the lawsuit filed tuesday was the first brought by the federal 
government alleging housing discrimination against the handicapped 
under the fair housig amendments act that went into effect march 12 
the department said 
the department contends the chicago heights city council denied 
the request in may because of neighbors opposition based on fears 
and prejudices concerning the mentally retarded 
the council in the suburb of 32000 people denied a specialuse 
permit for construction of a home for 15 adults in a neighborhood of 
singlefamily and twofamily homes 
chicago heights police commissioner john gliottoni one of the 
five council members said the council followed recommendations of 
the citys zoning board and its planning commission as it almost 
always does 
they are the sounding boards gliottoni said they listen 
to all the people who are for it and all the people who are against 
it we as council members have no input whatsoever 
james p turner acting assistant attorney general in charge of 
the justice departments civil rights division said the case 
signals our determination to make sure that the handicapped enjoy 
the full benefits of the protections the act gives them 
under the new fair housing act stereotypes and baseless fears 
concerning the handicapped cannot be used to block the development 
of group homes turner said in the statement from washington 
the lawsuit asks the federal court in chicago to bar chicago 
heights from interfering with construction of the home and to assess 
unspecified damages and a penalty 
turner defended the concept of group homes which have 
encountered opposition from prospective neighbors and delaying 
tactics around the country 
studies have shown that these facilities are better for 
residents than the outofsight outofmind institutions of the 
past and that they have no adverse effects on the neighborhood

aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
called for scaling back the yearly purchases of tridents in light of 
ussoviet arms control advances

amendment requiring the navy to study whether one trident a year is 
necessary said perry pockros an aide to rep sam gejdenson dconn 
earlier the subcommittee rejected 76 an amendment to eliminate 
a guided missile destroyer requested by cheney and use the money for 
an attack sub according to david boomer an aide to rep john

front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
a spokesman for the lebanese civil defense said rescuers 
evacuated eight wounded guerrillas from the targeted site wooded 
hills of naameh overlooking the mediterranean the spokesman refused

all planes returned safely and the targets were damaged the 
israeli army said in an announcement from jerusalem it made no 
mention of casualties 
it was israels ninth air attack into lebanon this year and the 
second in a week 
on friday israeli warplanes raided south lebanons rashidiyeh 
palestinian refugee camp police said two children were wounded in 
the attack 
by police count nine people have been killed and 60 wounded in 
the previous eight israeli air strikes which began jan 11 
jibrils group is headquartered in the syrian capital damascus 
and maintains bases in a chain of tunnels across the naameh hills 
a police spokesman said four warplanes blasted the hilltop 
positions in six runs spaced over one hour thick palls of dust and 
smoke billowed from the stricken targets 
druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist party 
militia also has bases in the hills and his militiaman blocked all 
roads leading to naameh firing ak47 assault rifles into the air to 
prevent reporters from passing checkpoints to the stricken area

the navy will search the ocean floor more than 
three miles down for the 800pound cargo door that ripped from a 
united airlines jet on feb 24 and sent nine people to their deaths 
according to a news report 
the navy operation about 85 miles southwest of honolulu is 
scheduled for october abc reported tuesday 
a row of seats was sucked through the hole on the new 
zealandbound flight when the fuselage tore open the pilots managed 
to get the crippled boeing 747 back to honolulu for a landing that 
saved the 345 people still aboard 
the national transporation safety board which requested the 
search the federal aviation administration united and boeing co 
have agreed to share the estimated 300000 cost of recovering the 
door abc said 
at this time we intend to pursue getting it ntsb spokesman 
ted lopatkiewicz told the honolulu advertiser 
united spokesman rob doughty told the advertiser the airline is 
willing to pay its 70000 share and had been in contact with the 
safety agency 
david jimenez a boeing spokesman said tuesday i think were 
proceeding to recover the door but he said he did not know any 
details of the plan or how the navy would do it 
ntsb investigators have said the door would help determine what 
caused the plane to pop open at 22000 feet ripping a 10by20foot 
hole in the fuselage 
in april a threeday hearing on the accident failed to produce 
conclusive evidence of the cause united executives said then they 
wanted to see the door recovered 
negotiations were reported to be under way at that time on 
whether to retrieve the door and how the costs would be divided 
military radar had tracked an object believed to be the cargo 
door falling into the ocean at a point where the water is 16800 
feet deep 
soon after the mishap undersea experts said the navy is probably 
the only agency with equipment capable of handling the recovery of 
the door 
a search would probably involve use of a sonar sled and a 
remotecontrolled vehicle with a camera paul wolcott a research 
submarine pilot at the hawaii undersea research lab at the 
university of hawaii said earlier this year 
the vehicle could probably hook a line to the door to lift it to 
the surface he said 
the least likely possibility because of the tremendous cost up 
to 40000 a day would be the navys sea cliff one of the worlds 
few manned research submarines capable of reaching that depth 
wolcott said

a witness testified he was told that movie 
producer robert evans and a drug dealer paid for the cotton club 
murder evans lawyer called the accusation an outrageous lie 
evans producer of such films as chinatown and marathon 
man has not been charged in the case 
william rider former security chief for hustler magazine 
publisher larry flynt testified tuesday that defendant william 
molony mentzer told him about the 1983 slaying of new york 
theatrical producer roy radin who had been working with evans to 
finance the film the cotton club 
mentzer admitted he was one of the killers and named alex lamota 
marti as another rider testified at a preliminary hearing on murder 
charges against mentzer marti and a third defendant karen delayne 
greenberger 
did mr mentzer indicate to you that anyone else was involved 
in the killing of mr radin asked deputy district attorney david 
conn 
yes said rider adding after prodding from conn mrs 
greenberger and robert evans 
did he say what their involvement was asked conn 
yes essentially that they paid for the contract rider said 
rider said mentzer had mentioned two reasons why evans the 
former chief of production at paramount pictures and mrs 
greenberger a reputed drug dealer would have wanted radin killed 
one variation was that mr radin was killed because of the 
stealing of mrs greenbergers drugs rider said and the other 
version was mr radin tried to cut mrs greenberger out of the movie 
deal 
the cotton club was being financed in a deal between radin 
and evans when radin disappeared his body was found a month later 
in a dry river bed he had been shot repeatedly in the head 
anybody who makes a statement that evans is involved in this 
case is telling an outrageous lie its absolutely untrue said 
evans attorney robert shapiro if the state believed it was 
true hed be a defendant not a witness 
evans was called as a witness but declined to testify on grounds 
his answers might tend to incriminate him 
the hearing before municipal judge patti jo mckay is to determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence for those charged to stand 
trial 
radin an obese cocainesniffing impresario from new yorks long 
island appeared on his way to hollywood success in 1983 raising 
35 million to finance the cotton club a movie about a famous 
harlem nightspot 
he was killed before the deal was completed and others 
including evans ultimately produced the film

the superpowers held their first full meeting in 
the latest round of talks on cutting longrange nuclear arms but 
chances of a breakthrough looked slim after both sides refused to 
budge on major issues 
the bush administration was expected to propose verification 
measures aimed at speeding progress on a treaty with the soviet 
union 
it was not clear when or in what detail the us side would 
present its proposals both sides were observing an official news 
blackout in geneva on the substance of the talks 
on tuesday soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said a pact to 
cut each sides longrange nuclear forces is part of the next 
phase in disarmament 
the basis for this already exists and the oustanding questions 
are not insurmountable as far as we are concerned if the two parties 
make the necessary efforts gorbachev said in a message carried by 
the official tass news agency 
the two new chief arms negotiators richard burt and yuri 
nazarkin led their delegations in the first full meeting of the 
11th round of talks a 2hour session at the us mission talks 
began in march 1985 
the negotiations are on the strategic arms reduction treaty 
intended to cut longrange nuclear forces and space and defense 
issues the talks are aimed at reducing us and soviet longrange 
bombers missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent 
this round due to last about six weeks began monday with a 
meeting of the two delegation heads 
both burt and nazarkin made plain that their public positions 
remain unchanged on several major issues including mobile nuclear 
missiles 
on tuesday president bush suggested he might back away from us 
insistence on banning these weapons if congress approves a plan for 
upgrading us strategic forces according to congressional leaders 
who met with him 
the plan would include funding for both the 10warhead mx and the 
singlewarhead midgetman missiles 
two other disputes center on us plans for spacebased missile 
defenses and whether to include longrange sealaunched cruise 
missiles in start 
under a us anticheating plan outlined by bush on monday both 
sides would begin tackling the tricky problem of verification early 
by testing monitoring procedures during the talks rather than 
waiting until the treaty is completed 
the washington post quoted an unidentified official in washington 
as saying such trial inspections would involve roundtheclock 
monitoring of some ballistic missile factories and onsite checks of 
missile warheads the proposal also was reported to include a ban on

banning travel by us military close to the east german border 
area being absent without leave and failing to obey regulations

he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist

an audit of the federal housing administration is 
expected to show that its main mortgage insurance fund has been 
suffering losses at a rate that could run it dry in five months the 
new york times said today 
the newspaper citing government investigators and private 
auditors said the findings will be contained in the first full 
audit of the 55yearold agency which insures 275 billion worth of 
us home mortgages 
it cited agency officials as saying the fha was down to a 
fivemonth reserve 28 billion to cover holders of defaulted 
mortgages 
when the reserve runs out the treasury must pick up the payments 
the main fund is the mutual mortgage insurance fund which covers 
55 million mortgages of up to 101000 each on singlefamily homes 
the insurance is financed largely by premiums paid by home buyers 
claims on the fund amounted to 29 billion in 1986 44 billion 
in 1988 and will hit an estimated 66 billion this year according 
to budget documents cited by the times 
it said that a general accounting office report last month put 
fhas losses for the year ending september 1988 at 452 million and 
that preliminary figures for the following six months indicated an 
additional 150 million in losses 
economic downturns particularly in the oil industry in the 
southwest plus fraud mismanagement and a sluggish housing market 
contributed to the agencys problems the times said 
senior officials of the fhas parent organization the department 
of housing and urban development speaking anonymously said the two 
consecutive years of losses did not pose a serious threat the times 
said 
but a private auditor said he was less optimistic particularly 
if there were a recession

prime minister yitzhak shamir who has been 
denounced as a traitor by ultranationalist jewish settlers urged 
israelis not to battle among themselves over how to end the 
palestinian uprising 
shamir also endorsed a proposal to include jewish settlers in 
army defense units in the occupied lands despite a recent rise in 
settler attacks on palestinians 
in the west bank city of nablus meanwhile assailants shot and 
killed taxi driver hassan sharoub a 47yearold palestinian who was 
suspected of cooperating with israel radio reports and arab 
journalists said 
an army official confirmed a fatal shooting in nablus and said 
the circumstances were under investigation 
sharoubs death brought to 527 the number of palestinians killed 
in the 18month uprising against israeli rule in the west bank and 
occupied gaza strip the figure includes 64 suspected collaborators 
twentythree israelis also have died 
israeli newspapers reported today that defense minister yitzhak 
rabin has asked israeli experts to examine the legality of using 
harsher measures against palestinians 
rabin reportedly wants to deport palestinians within a week after 
such an order has been issued deportees now can appeal the order 
and the legal procedure can take months 
rabin also wants to scrap the possibility of appealing 
armyordered house demolitions the davar newspaper reported 
the army sometimes destroys or seals the homes of palestinians 
suspected of attacks on israelis the united states has condemned 
the practice saying it denies suspects due process of law because 
the army usually acts before a suspect has been tried 
shamir has come under growing pressure from the extreme right to 
use harsher measures to quell the uprising his critics also argue 
that his peace plan based on elections in the occupied lands will 
pave the way for a palestinian state 
on tuesday settlers shouted down shamir as he spoke at the 
funeral of a usborn west bank settler allegedly slain by 
palestinians 
shamir said on israel radio today that disagreements over 
government policies must not degenerate into domestic strife we 
must do everything to make sure such a war never happens this is 
the most dangerous thing shamir said 
i would suggest to everyone to lower the profile of our 
internal debates because if the profile rises you can slide into 
irresponsible actions he added 
shamirs rival in the likud bloc ultranationalist industry 
minister ariel sharon was met by thunderous applause during 
tuesdays funeral sharon has engineered a showdown with shamir over 
the peace plan at a likud convention next month 
a poll published by the yediot ahronot daily wednesday indicated 
shamir had the support of 55 percent of the 2600 members of the 
partys central committee twentyone percent opposed it and 24 
percent were undecided the poll said 
in an apparent bid to appease the settlers shamir said he backed 
a proposal to include them in regional defense units we can 
definitely take this path he said 
in the past settlers doing army reserve duty were barred from 
serving near their hometowns most israeli men serve in the reserves 
for up to two months a year until age 54 
shamir also criticized an attack tuesday in which a 23yearold 
jewish settler fired at a group of palestinians standing at an 
intersection near tel aviv two arabs were wounded one of them 
seriously 
israel radio said the assailant who staged the shooting after 
attending the funeral of the slain settler has a police record 
we must prevent such actions they only strengthen the other 
side the extremists among the arabs shamir said

a jewish leader said today he has received new 
assurances that a roman catholic convent on the grounds of the 
auschwitz death camp will be finally be moved ending a 5yearold 
dispute 
ernst ludwig ehrlich european director of bnai brith said in 
a telephone interview that he was confident that the convent would 
be located after a conversation with cardinal franciszek macharski 
archbishop of cracow poland whose diocese includes auschwitz 
under the terms of a 1987 geneva declaration signed by 18 
catholic and jewish leaders macharski is charged with arranging the 
transfer of the convent founded in 1984 
jews have protested the convent located in a former storehouse 
on the auschwitz camp perimeter as a christian symbol that intrudes 
on the place that was one of hitlers busiest extermination camps 
nazi germany killed 6 million jews during world war ii 
the geneva declaration recognized the special significance of 
auschwitz in the holocaust and called for the transfer of the 
convents 14 carmelite nuns within two years 
when the deadline passed on feb 22 there were renewed calls for 
removal of the convent 
there also was considerable opposition among polands catholics 
but ehrlich a cosigner of the declaration said that in a june 7 
letter macharski said this opposition was fading construction of a 
convent 500 yards from the camp would most probably begin early 
next year the letter said 
the letter makes plain that all preconditions exist now for the 
implementation of the accord ehrlich said i never doubted that 
macharski would stick to the accord but it is a pity that all this 
could not be done already two years ago 
macharski said in the letter that jewish impatience is 
completely understandable but that protests only provoke adverse 
reactions from the population and strengthen it in the blind defense 
of the nuns 
it would be sad if this would create a gulf between between 
catholics and jews in poland he wrote

shanghai authorities today publicly executed three 
men convicted of setting a train on fire during prodemocracy 
protests and more people were sentenced to die in another city for 
their roles in the protests 
the executions were the first announced since the june 34 
military crackdown that crushed the studentled movement the three 
died one day after shanghais highest court rejected their appeals 
and just two weeks after their alleged crimes were committed 
the men were shot to death in front of a crowd said a spokesman 
at the shanghai foreign affairs office he said he did not know 
other details and refused to give his name 
death sentences in china usually are carried out by a bullet to 
the back of the head there is no record of a death sentence in 
communist china being overturned on appeal although they sometimes 
are commuted to life in prison 
the united states and other western governments had appealed for 
clemency for the three and for eight people in beijing also given 
death sentences in connection with the protests 
but shanghai radio in announcing the courts rejection of the 
appeal said there are no legal reasons for mitigating the 
punishment of xu guoming bian hanwu and yan xuerong 
xu and yan who are workers and bian who is unemployed set 
fire to a train june 6 after it ran through a barricade set up by 
protesters and killed six people the three were convicted thursday 
in the northeastern city of jinan 45 people accused of taking 
part in protests were convicted in a mass trial before a crowd of 
about 10000 beijing radio reported 
the report said some of the 45 were sentenced to death others 
received death sentences with a twoyear reprieve at the end of two 
years the sentences could be reduced to life in prison for good 
behavior 
others were given life in prison or lesser terms according to the 
report monitored by the british broadcasting corp it did not give 
a breakdown but said those given death were convicted of seriously 
endangering public order 
an editor at the jinan daily contacted by telephone said 17 of 
the 45 were sentenced to death he said he did not know if the 
figure included those given twoyear reprieves he said the trial 
was held tuesday and no executions had been carried out 
the stiff sentences came one day after chinas supreme court 
ordered lower courts to deal swiftly and severely with people 
accused of taking part in the protests which the party is 
condemning as counterrevolutionary rebellion 
in other developments the government today ordered colleges to 
set up new political education programs so students will learn to 
love socialism and love the army and accept official 
condemnation of the protests 
new arrests were reported raising the total reported nationwide 
to more than 1600 since june 4 when the army killed hundreds of 
unarmed civilians in beijing in crushing the studentled movement 
for a freer less corrupt society 
authorities at beijing airport arrested four people who were 
involved in the protests and trying to flee the beijing daily said 
it said two were women trying to board a parisbound plane under 
false names it did not detail their alleged crimes 
british prime minister margaret thatcher today condemned the 
executions as totally out of proportion to the crime and said 
she and australian prime minister bob hawke discussed steps against 
china during a meeting in london 
asked if they planned diplomatic or other reprisals against 
china mrs thatcher said without elaboration that this had been 
discussed 
president bush on tuesday ordered that us government officials 
suspend all highlevel contacts with chinese officials washington 
also said it would seek to postpone consideration of new loans to 
china by international organizations in order to protest the 
harshness of the crackdown 
in hebei province south of beijing officials said they arrested 
44 ruffians who took part in protests in the capital among them 
were two members of the united association of beijing universities 
the independent student union that led seven weeks of prodemocracy 
protests 
shanghai officials said 65 people had surrendered there 
including 42 leaders of independent student unions and other illegal 
groups it said they repented and some after seeing the light 
informed on others 
the state education commission sent a notice to all provincial 
and local governments ordering them to arrange political 
ideological education for college students especially those 
graduating this year 
the order published in the communist party newspaper peoples 
daily says the main weapon in such classes should be a june 9 
speech by senior leader deng xiaoping that claimed the students were 
used by antiparty plotters who sought to establish a westernstyle 
democracy in china 
deng said in the speech that the greatest mistake of his 10 years 
in power was a failure of political education of both the students 
and the public 
the recent counterrevolutionary rebellion was a very good 
lesson the state education commission said

charter planes flew hundreds of weary 
tourists home today after they were plucked from a soviet ocean 
liner that had crashed into an iceberg cutting short a pleasure 
cruise to the land of the midnight sun 
workers plugged the holes on the 630foot cruise ship maxim gorky 
and the vessel steamed toward the island of spitsbergen today 
escorted by two other soviet vessels the soviet news agency tass 
said 
maritime experts said the ocean liner on a cruise to see the 
24hour summer light in the arctic was moving too fast when it 
struck the ice in the norwegian sea 300 miles east of northern 
greenland and 180 miles west of spitsbergen no one was seriously 
injured 
norwegian helicopters flew the aged and most infirm to safety 
but some passengers spent up to seven hours huddled under blankets 
in lifeboats until they were picked up others waited on ice floes 
for west german passenger giesela rillinger it was six hours 
of nothing but ice floes and the sky if a storm had come up it 
would have been all over for us six hours of facing death 
the norwegian coast guard ship senja evacuated 660 passengers 
all but about a dozen west germans and 193 maxim gorky crew 
members to longyearbyen norways administrative center on 
spitzbergen island from where the tourists were flown to 
dusseldorf west germany 
capt marat s galimov and 192 other soviet crew members remained 
on the maxim gorky said sigurd kleiven captain of the senja 
kleiven said it was galimovs first voyage in the area 
tour leader winfried prinz said he was standing on the bridge 
next to galimov when the ship struck the iceberg 
it happened very fast prinz told a reporter in dusseldorf 
we went into the ice field without warning and unexpectedly 
something nobody had counted on the ship was cruising at normal 
speed about 18 knots so it wasnt exactly slow as the collision 
shook the ship prinz said 
kleiven said the liner was moving at 184 knots when it hit the 
ice tearing a gash 20 feet long and four to six inches wide in the 
bow 
i would hardly have sailed faster than two to three knots in 
such iceclogged water kleiven told reporters on board his coast 
guard vessel 
there was fog in the area and it seems to me as if the maxim 
gorky may have sped too fast straight into the ice kleiven said 
but experienced norwegian sailors agreed the maxim gorky had 
sailed too fast in an area often clogged with ice 
not even the coast guard vessels sail faster than three to five 
knots in such waters guttorm jacobsen a skipper who has sailed 
the arctic for 40 years told the verdens gang newspaper the 
maxim gorky must have been too eager to keep its schedule 
the newspaper quoted other experts as saying that even if the 
captain had seen the ice from a distance of 10 miles it would have 
taken his ship up to 45 minutes to stop from a speed of 18 knots 
the soviet embassy in oslo said the ship today was moving at 45 
knots toward spitzbergen where it would receive emergency repairs 
it was accompanied by a soviet tugboat and a freighter 
the ship set out june 11 from bremerhaven west germany sailed 
to iceland and encountered its difficulties while sailing around the 
spitsbergen archipelago on its way to norway 
maxim gorky had about 952 people aboard when it struck the ice 
early tuesday while most passengers were partying in a shipboard 
nightclub 
the luxury liner was built in 1969 in west germany and sold to 
the soviets in 1974

a leftwing alliance has emerged as power 
broker in efforts to build a coalition government but greeks girded 
for a political crisis and new elections 
the alleged involvement of leaders of premier andreas 
papandreous panhellenic socialist party in financial scandals was 
blamed for its defeat in sundays election 
the conservative new democracy party which finished first today 
sought partners in an interim coalition government dedicated to 
investigating the scandals and prosecuting those reponsible but the 
alliance of two communist parties has rejected a new democracy offer 
the alliance also refuses to cooperate with papandreou making 
the possibility of new elections likely and paralyzing parliament 
which cannot order an inquiry if the political parties cannot form a 
government 
judicial investigators today asked parliament to lift the 
immunity of two former ministers in the defeated socialist 
government former deputy premier agamemnon koutsogiorgas and 
former public order minister george petsos so they can be 
prosecuted on bribery charges 
under the constitution ministers only can be prosecuted for 
criminal offenses committed while in office if parliament lifts 
their immunity 
under existing judicial regulations the evidence against the two 
ministers remains secret until presented to parliament 
the new parliament is to convene july 3 there is doubt whether 
it will do so because of the inability of constantine mitsotakis 
new democracy which won 144 of 300 seats in parliament to form a 
majority government on monday mitsotakis was given three days to 
build a coaltiion 
papandreous party came second with 125 seats and the communist 
alliance which won 29 seats has become a kingmaker in coalition 
talks the communist alliance also has pushed for investigation of 
the financial scandals and has refused to join a coalition with 
papandreous party unless he and other party leaders it maintains 
are tainted by scandal resign 
koutsogiorgas has been accused of allegedly receiving 2 million 
from george koskotas the owner of the bank of crete koskotas is 
now under arrest in the united states pending the hearing of an 
extradition request by the greek government 
koutsogiorgas was dropped from the socialist partys list of 
candidates following testimony in march by yannis mantzouranis that 
koutsogiorgas received the money for helping pass a bank secrecy law 
that blocked investigators from checking into the troubled bank of 
crete

florida lawmakers passed a bill making 
gun owners subject to prison terms if their firearms are used by 
children to shoot someone 
the legislature acted after accidental shootings killed three 
children since june 5 
we have experienced too many tragedies and its time to put an 
end to them said rep harry jennings a retired army colonel who 
has pushed the proposal for two years 
the senate passed the gunsafety bill 266 and the house approved 
it 7139 on tuesday gov bob martinez who was persuaded last week 
to include the bill in this weeks special session was expected to 
sign the measure 
under the bill gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons in 
their homes could be charged with a felony carrying up to five years 
in prison and a 5000 fine if children 15 years and younger hurt 
someone with the firearms 
if the child displays the gun in public the gun owner could be 
charged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a 
500 fine 
exemptions are provided for hunting and target shooting 
accidents shootings involving stolen guns and the guns of law 
enforcement officers or military personnel the law also provides a 
sevenday delay before parents of a wounded child can be arrested on 
the felony charge 
jennings the bills sponsor described it as one of the most 
important pieces of legislation that we have addressed in years in 
this legislature 
his legislation gained national attention after three florida 
children were killed and four wounded in seven accidents earlier 
this month 
the bill requires gunshop owners to post a sign explaining the 
law and to hand out a written warning to customers the measure also 
directs the state department of education to prepare a gunsafety 
education program that lawmakers can consider next year 
a lobbyist for the national rifle association said the bill was 
acceptable 
my job was to try to help produce a bill that had the potential 
to do some good and not just run willynilly damaging additional 
lives said nra lobbyist marion hammer 
rep dick locke led the opponents in the house which had 
approved a similar version during the regular session that ended 
june 3 
this bill does not make common sense locke said you cant 
put mama and daddy in jail the kids in a foster home the court 
system is full the fails are full 
other opponents contended that more children are hurt and killed 
in accidents involving cars pools fires and household poisons than 
guns 
accidental gunshots are the fifthleading cause of death of us 
children under age 14 and florida has one of the three highest 
rates of accidental shootings in the country according to sen 
jeanne malchon who proposed similar legislation two years ago 
last year 441 florida children were injured or killed by guns 
and another 3110 were victims of crimes involving firearms

the utility that operates the rancho 
seco nuclear plant is taking bids for a takeover of the power 
station that voters decided to close 
the 32 decision tuesday by the sacramento municipal utility 
district to take bids over the next 10 days angered many of the 
activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant which 
has a history of operating problems 
the board majority argued that the june 6 ballot measure in which 
the electorate decided to close the plant doesnt forbid someone 
else from runnning it 
the sale of rancho seco would save the community the 200 million 
to 300 million cost of shutting it down said joseph buonaiuto 
board president 
voters earlier this month decided in a nonbinding referendum to 
close the plant agreeing with opponents arguments that it is 
unsafe and uneconomical and a majority of the utility board agreed

february to recall their envoys from iran in retaliation for a death 
sentence issued by khomeini against british author salman rushdie 
for allegedly blaspheming islam in his novel the satanic verses 
france and west germany decided last week to send back their 
ambassadors to iran after the death june 3 of khomeini 86 several 
european countries have already sent back their envoys

the reagan administration today opposed a bill 
aimed at denying exxon corp a tax deduction for costs of cleaning 
up the alaska oil spill 
the bill would violate the fundamental principle of business 
taxation that a taxpayers ordinary and necessary business expenses 
may be deducted in computing net income kenneth w gideon 
assistant treasury secretary for tax policy told the senate finance 
committee 
sen harry reid dnev sponsor of the bill said i do not 
want to tell my constituents that the american people owe exxon the 
biggest polluter in history millions of dollars in a tax rebate in 
return for destroying the environment and raising prices at the gas 
pumps 
waving a handful of exxon credit cards that irate customers had 
mailed him in protest reid added 
given the companys dismal cleanup performance and the 
resultant permanent scar that now defaces alaskas beauty it is 
incomprehensible that exxon should be able to claim its cleanup 
costs estimated at 500 million as an ordinary and necessary 
cost of doing business 
some 10 million gallons of crude oil were spilled into alaskas 
prince william sound on march 24 when the tanker exxon valdez ran 
aground 
a large share of exxons cleanup costs apparently are covered by 
insurance under present law any uninsured share could be deducted 
from taxable income as a cost of doing business because the top 
corporate tax rate is 34 percent the effect would be for the 
federal treasury to pay 34 percent of the uninsured expenses 
reids bill which also would apply to any future chemical spill 
would prohibit such a deduction unless the federal government 
certified that the cleanup had been conducted in accordance with the 
law 
sen ted stevens ralaska who said he supports the concept of 
reids bill pointed out that existing environmental laws contain no 
objective standards for determining whether a cleanup was proper 
paul r huard vice president of the national association of 
manufacturers which opposes the bill said the legislation likely 
would discourage corporate efforts to clean up spills 
because the sanctions are so draconian a likely response 
is that taxpayers involved in oil spills or hazardous substance 
dischages will undertake very little cleanup activity on their own 
initiative and instead will choose to protect the deductibility of 
their expenditures by awaiting specific directions from the 
applicable government agency huard said 
the bill was supported by clifton e curtis executive director 
of the oceanic society an environmental group he said the 
legislation should be made tougher by denying tax deductions to 
spillers for oil or hazardous spillrelated expenses without regard 
to adequacy of cleanup 
such an approach would send a message that would foster 
stronger preventive measures by industry curtis said 
rep william o lipinski dill who has introduced a companion 
bill to reids in the house said exxons cleanup expenses should 
not be taxdeductible because oil and toxic spill cleanup is not 
ordinary and is not a necessary business expense

the utility that operates the rancho 
seco nuclear plant is taking bids for a takeover of the power 
station that voters decided to close 
the 32 decision tuesday by the sacramento municipal utility 
district to take bids over the next 10 days angered many of the 
activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant which 
has a history of operating problems 
the board majority argued that the june 6 ballot measure in which 
the electorate decided to close the plant doesnt forbid someone 
else from runnning it 
the sale of rancho seco would save the community the 200 million 
to 300 million cost of shutting it down said joseph buonaiuto 
board president 
voters earlier this month decided in a nonbinding referendum to 
close the plant agreeing with opponents arguments that it is 
unsafe and uneconomical and a majority of the utility board agreed 
to abide by the outcome 
the plant was taken out of service june 7 and so far about 400 
contract workers have lost their jobs 
the vote marked the first time citizens have decided to close an 
operating reactor 
sacramentans for safe energy an antirancho seco group has said 
it will sue to stop the transfer of rancho seco to businesses that 
might continue to operate it 
we will wait and see what happens in the 10day period said

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the country 
june 17 
the journal new ulm minn on the minimum wage bill veto 
it certainly could have come as no surprise to anyone the veto 
by president bush of the bill raising the minimum wage 
president bush repeatedly had made it clear that he would not 
sign legislation increasing the minimum wage beyond 425 per hour 
he also insisted that the increase be accompanied by a subminimum 
training wage that employers could pay to all newly employed workers 
for as long as six months 
the president maintained that to go any higher on the minimum 
wage would cause an unacceptable loss of jobs and add to 
inflationary pressure 
unless congress and bush can come to some agreement the end 
result will be that there will be no increase of any kind in the 
minimum wage this year the working poor will be denied any 
increase at all because some people want to score a political 
point noted senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
no doubt his political opponents will portray the president as 
being insensitive to the needs of the working poor because of the 
veto we dont think the american people will buy such propaganda 
however 
the president had no choice but to disapprove the minimum wage 
bill he had made his position clear and had to stick with it

the providence ri sunday journal on the us miliary space 
program 
with little fanfare another competitor in the space payload 
business entered or rather reentered the list against nasa 
this past week 
it was the department of defense and its new titan 4 rocket 
provides the military with a payload capacity even larger than that 
of the famous shuttle 
the morning liftoff of this 204foot workhorse was an encouraging 
success it not only lifted a substantial payload thought to be a 
new early warning satellite off cape canaveral but removed a huge 
worry from the pentagons shoulders 
the explosion of the challenger three years ago threw the 
military space program into disarray this titan launch represents 
the pentagons desire to reduce its dependency on a single type of

spartanburg sc heraldjournal on firearms and children 
the lesson is abundantly obvious any adult who keeps a firearm 
of any kind handy in a home where there are children even if 
theyre just frequent visitors should be sure to keep the weapon 
safely away from the reach of little ones 
everybody in the family should be carefully taught about handling 
pistols or rifles and about proper use of them 
young people see so much gunplay on television nowadays that it 
becomes rather routine and mundane in their minds when weapons are 
around children should be taught about the dangers guns pose in 
careless or untrained hands adults also stand constant reminding 
themselves 
a state legislator from sarasota fla reintroduced a bill that 
was killed in 1988 and died in committee this year to make the owner 
of a gun liable when the weapon is left within the reach of a child 
who shoots someone 
any rational person can imagine the horror facing parents whose 
children become cold statistics because of a combination of 
youthfulness guns and adult irresponsibility owners of weapons 
that kill should bear some of the burden

the army has a proposal to make it all right to murder those 
decreed to be terrorists others led by our current president 
george the kind and gentle spy and his drug czar want the right to 
open fire on anyone decreed to be a drug trafficker 
we elect a government to govern not to run around killing people 
without trial ceremony or second thought 
besides murder is wrong just as wrong for a bunch of 
proactive pinheads who claim truth and justice is on their side 
as it is for you and me 
it is especially wrong for a country like ours that claims to be 
above official murder one that believes in trials and freedom and

the hemet calif news on the minimum wage bill veto 
president bushs veto of the minimumwage increase which the 
house failed to override accomplished two things 
first it prevented congressional demagogues from destroying 
hundreds of thousands of jobs for poor people in the name of 
compassion but more important it showed the bush is willing to 
unleash one of his offices most powerful weapons 
was this particular veto justified absolutely by hiking the 
minimum wage more than onethird to 455 an hour the 
congressional bill would have effectively prevented employers from 
hiring many firsttime or poorlyprepared workers instead of 
lowpaying jobs many lowskilled youths from the inner cities would 
have found themselves with no jobs at all 
his own proposal would have raised the minimum wage from the 
current 335 per hour to 425 but would have allowed employers to 
pay a lower amount during a workers first six months on the job 
the congressional bill would have restricted the training wage to a 
mere 60 days 
predictably the unions allies on capitol hill are denouncing 
bushs veto as antiworker but if the president wants to do good 
rather than just look good holding firm on such issues is the best 
course for him to take

farmington nm daily times on the tax increase proposal 
democrats in the us house of representatives are determined to 
increase the federal tax burden on americans 
a house ways and means committee subcommittee approved a measure 
last week that would raise the tax that finances unemployment 
insurance 
the additional tax would cost employers 4 per worker annually 
beginning in 1992 and is expected to add 106 billion to federal 
coffers during the next five years 
people are getting disgusted with national leaders who think they 
were elected to devise more ways to spend the publics money 
most of us are looking for elected officials to come up with ways 
to reduce the tax burden on individual americans and private 
businesses 
the more congress taxes the more congress spends thats why our 
national debt is expected to reach 28 trillion this summer

the peninsula daily news port angeles wash on el salvador 
on the last day of a threeday swing through central america 
vice president dan quayle asked salvadoran rightists not to do 
anything of an embarrassing nature 
by that the vice president meant for members of the rightist 
arena party in san salvador to abstain from political torture and 
killing give newly elected president alfredo cristiani a chance to 
try his moderate approach quayle advised 
the us assessment of conflicts in el salvador and other parts 
of central america has never been what people familiar with the 
region would call clearheaded but quayles remarks suggest a 
complete break with reality 
cristiani a millionaire businessman handpicked by the extreme 
right is a moderate only in his approach to the us officials who 
have a say in sustaining us support for the salvadoran military 
he is just a new articulate front man for the same old rightist 
coalition of military leaders wealthy businessmen and landowners 
 
the same rightwing forces responsible for the campaign of terror 
in the early 1980s came back to power with the election of 
cristiani expect the same murderous tactics this is all the arena 
crowd knows 
it is a tragedy for the salvadoran people who suffered terribly 
through 10 long years of civil war 
their return also amounts to a defeat of us policies aimed at 
cultivating a moderate centrist government in el salvador that 
could end the war and move the country toward democratic reform 
that is hard to swallow no question but ignoring it as quayle 
and other us policy makers seem to be doing will not make it 
easier

the arizona daily star tucson ariz on chinese dissidents 
while ambassador james lilley has said the united states doesnt 
want to inflame the situation by posturing the state department was 
nevertheless straightforwardly vocal in flatly stating its 
intention to protect chinese dissidents fang lizhi and li shuxian 
the united states must not waver in its commitment to this 
couple even if it means letting them stay indefinitely at the us 
embassy in beijing 
the importance of that commitment exists on two levels one 
personal the other symbolic 
with several executions already ordered by chinese officials 
fang is in grave personal danger since the crime he is accused 
of is comparable to treason on a broader scale since fang and his 
wife are aligned with the aspirations of the student democracy 
movement us treatment of them will also inevitably symbolize its 
regard for the movement as well as its commitment to the ideals of 
free expression and democracy 
author orville schell wrote for the new york times deng 
xiaoping and li peng have begun searching for ways to divert 
attention from the carnage they wrought in tiananmen square on june 
3 he was referring to their singling out of fang as an 
archenemy of the nation 
since that piece was written the government has moved on adding 
two western journalists as still more diversions still more objects 
of contempt 
it is a familiar maneuver for chinese officials now associated 
press reporter john pomfret and voice of americas beijing bureau 
chief alan pessin have been expelled pomfret who speaks chinese 
and who had done much reporting among student demonstrators was an 
obvious target as was pessin whose organizations broadcasts have 
tried to counter the chinese governments shameful rewriting of 
recent history 
it is vital that the united states make known through both words 
and deeds that it deplores the mass arrests the planned 
executions the attempt to rewrite history the intention to arrest 
dissident fang lizhi and the expulsion of journalists

the registerherald beckley wva on chinese dissidents 
chinese dissident fang lizhi is not the first to seek refuge in 
an american embassy nor is it likely he will be the last 
fang is holed up in the us embassy in beijing china has issued 
official proclamations to stop fang at all borders and all points of 
transportation out of the country but the dissident need not take 
another step 
the bush administration has three options but only one choice 
under no circumstance should fang be handed over to the 
authorities who want fangs hide for his role in the demonstrations 
that led to the violent showdown two weeks ago 
to spirit fang out of the country would serve only to provoke the 
chinese government provoked enough already because we are giving 
fang sanctuary 
the only choice is to house fang indefinitely inside the embassy 
that would be a form of passive resistance to chinas latest 
outrage 
but in making that choice america would be wise to be prepared 
for further outrages

the milwaukee journal on a healthy start program for infants 
children deserve the best possible start in life that means 
their mothers must have adequate prenatal care a relative luxury 
for the thousands of wisconsin women not fortunate enough to be 
covered by insurance yet not needy enough to qualify for medicaid 
it is for these women and their infants less than a year old 
that wisconsins healthy start program was designed 
now legislators seem inclined to expand healthy start to include 
women whose family incomes are higher than current ceilings set by 
the state thats not just a compassionate gesture in the long run 
it would prove costeffective too 
healthy start pays all prenatal doctor bills whatever 
prescription costs the woman incurs during pregnancy and all 
expenses associated with labor and delivery in addition the 
program covers the costs of the mothers medical care for 60 days 
after delivery and the infants for a full year 
obviously a baby who is immunized and whose growth and 
development are tracked by a doctor will have an edge over one 
lacking such attention 
the benefits of prenatal care may seem murkier but are no less 
compelling the longer a woman delays prenatal visits to a doctor 
the more likely she is to bear a child needing medical attention 
because of prematurity low birth weight or some other complication 
experts calculate that every 1 spent on prenatal care saves 338 
that would otherwise have to be spent later on a youngster born with 
problems

the indianapolis star on the lottery and political contributions 
youd think that after devoting that much time and attention to 
the lottery state lawmakers would have gotten it right if they 
had there wouldnt be any wrangling about what they meant and what 
they didnt mean 
under dispute is a provision in the lottery statute governing 
political contributions it prohibits the lottery commission from 
entering into a contract with a person who contributed within the 
past three years to a candidate for a statewide office 
in addition individual vendors and service contractors may not 
contribute to a candidate for three years 
if the legislature had stated its intentions precisely clearly 
and unambiguously there would be no confusion no need for the 
governor to ask the attorney general for a ruling no need for the 
attorney general to make one and no bickering about the nature and 
content of the ruling

in an unprecedented move house republicans 
today asked the ethics committee to investigate gop rep donald e 
lukens of ohio convicted last month of charges stemming from his 
sexual relationship with a 16yearold girl 
the house republican conference the organization of all gop 
house members took the action in a closeddoor meeting at the 
behest of its top leadership according to a statement issued by 
minority leader robert michel rill 
such a request virtually ensures that the ethics panel will open 
a formal investigation of lukens who was convicted may 30 in 
franklin county ohio of contributing to the unruliness or 
delinquency of a minor he is appealing 
michel said the move reflects our total commitment to standards 
of behavior for members of congress which reflect honorably on the 
institution and the nation house republicans will not accept 
anything less 
he said the gop will live up to its constitutional obligation to 
police its own members no matter how distasteful or painful 
despite michels comments the move was seen as a preemptive 
strike by republicans and an effort to keep democrats on the 
defensive on the ethics issue which the gop has said will be its 
main emphasis this year the ethics committee likely would have 
investigated lukens anyway 
lukens spokesman william jarrell said congressman lukens 
welcomes a full and open investigation that may once and for all 
bring forth the truth about this entire episode in fact this will 
probably assist in our appeals 
jarrell said lukens was hampered in court because he was not 
permitted to cast doubt on the motives and credibility of the girl 
and her mother who were lukens accusers now well be able to 
bring forth the background and the motives of the two he said 
the jury found lukens guilty of the misdemeanor charge based on 
its conclusion that he had sex with the girl at his columbus 
apartment last november such a conviction does not automatically 
deny lukens the right to serve in congress or seek reelection 
the resolution asking for an investigation of lukens requests 
that the ethics panel formally called the committee on standards of 
official conduct determine whether rep donald e buz lukens 
failed to conduct himself at all times in a manner which reflects 
creditably on the house of representatives 
the source who spoke only on condition of anonymity said the 
resolution was passed by a show of hands on a substantial 
majority 
in presenting the resolution michel said it was unprecedented 
for the conference to call for an ethics probe of one of its own 
members 
and another member of the gop leadership rep robert walker of 
pennsylvania suggested democrats might do well to turn the ethics 
spotlight on their own bad apples 
we have taken that step of asking for an investigation 
walker said i think its an appropriate kind of step to suggest 
that the other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of 
tough thing that is involved in what our conference did today 
the document notes that house members in order to perform 
their constitutional duties must conduct themselves with 
integrity and that house rules require conduct which will not 
bring disrepute on the institution 
lukens 58 and divorced has said he planned to fight the 
conviction and remain in congress in the meantime i refuse to 
allow the lies and deceit of one delinquent individual to ruin me i 
am now fighting for my life he said in a statement following his 
conviction 
lukens said in that statement that his accuser had fantasies of 
getting even with the establishment 
but the court refused to allow him to bring up evidence he wanted 
to present to raise doubts about her reliability the conservative 
lawmaker said 
since the conviction ohio state gop chairman robert bennett has 
said lukens will not be on the partys ticket in 1990 based on 
opposition from local party officials 
lukens republican house colleagues also have distanced 
themselves from him his conviction has harmed their cause at a time 
when they have been seeking to use the ethics issue against 
democrats 
lukens is currently in the second term of his second stint in 
congress he also was in congress for two terms from 1967 to 1971

an anticipated supreme court showdown over 
state child pornography laws fizzled today when the justices in 
splintered voting sent a massachusetts case back to that states 
courts 
the court told the massachusetts supreme judicial court to decide 
whether a sinceamended state law can be used to prosecute douglas 
oakes 40 of holden mass for soliciting a child to pose in 
a state of nudity for pornographic purposes 
todays ruling is a setback for oakes who had been freed from 
any criminal liability by the states highest court 
oakes was criminally convicted in worcester county prosecutors 
said that in 1984 he induced his 14yearold stepdaughter to pose 
for photographs while clothed only in bikini underpants and a scarf 
police were contacted after the girls mother discovered the 
photos 
oakes was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was paroled after 
two years 
the states highest court threw out oakes conviction and 
dismissed the criminal indictment against him the state court said 
the 1982 law under which oakes was prosecuted was too broad and 
criminalized conduct that virtually every person would regard as 
lawful 
for example the state court said in its ruling the law 
makes a criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of his 
or her naked 1yearold running on a beach or romping in a wading 
pool 
the law later was amended to add a lascivious intent 
requirement 
todays decision was accompanied by three written opinions but no 
majority opinion attracting at least five justices 
four of the courts members led by justice sandra day oconnor 
said the issue of whether the original massachusetts law was 
overbroad became moot when it was amended 
two justices antonin scalia and harry a blackmun voted to 
reverse the massachusetts court and rule that oakes prosecution was 
constitutional 
perhaps i am wrong in my estimation of how frequently the 
posings prohibited by the old law are done for artistic purposes 
or for family photographs or in some other legitimate and 
constitutionally protected context i have not envisioned scalia 
wrote in an opinion joined by blackmun 
we can deal with such a situation in the unlikely event some

the supreme court today limited the power of 
states to outlaw the desecration or destruction of the american flag 
the justices voting 54 threw out the conviction of a protester 
sentenced to a year in jail and fined 2000 for burning the flag in 
texas 
in another case the court limited states power to punish the 
news media for printing truthful legally obtained information it 
threw out a 97500 award against a newspaper won by a rape victim 
whose name it published 
the court said a flagburning at a demonstration in dallas during 
the 1984 republican national convention was a form of expression 
protected by the constitutions guarantee of freedom of speech 
justice william j brennan writing for the court said if 
there is a bedrock principle underlying the 1st amendment it is 
that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea 
simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or 
disagreeable 
we do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration for 
in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem 
represents 
joining brennan were justices thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
the dissenters were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor and john paul stevens 
rehnquist in an opinion joined by white and oconnor said the 
flag is a unique national symbol and deserves unique protection 
the government may conscript men into the armed forces where 
they must fight and perhaps die for the flag rehnquist said 
but because of todays ruling the government may not prohibit 
the public burning of the banner under which they fight 
todays ruling might permit states to outlaw flag burning in some 
cases for example a flag burning that led to a riot could still be 
illegal brennan said texas already has a law banning conduct that 
leads to breaches of the peace and that is not affected by todays 
ruling 
but brennan said it violates constitutional freespeech 
guarantees to ban flag burning at political rallies or protests 
merely because the destruction of the flag offends some people or 
because the state wishes to preserve the flag as a symbol of 
national unity 
during the height of us involvement in the fighting in vietnam 
draftcard burning and falgburning were common forms of protest 
in a separate dissenting opinion stevens said sanctioning the 
public desecration of the flag will tarnsh its value both for 
those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who 
desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it 
in an unusual move both stevens and brennan read extensively 
from their opinions in the crowded courtroom today normally 
justices only give brief summations of opinions at most when the 
rulings are announced 
at the center of todays case is gregory joey johnson of new 
york city a member of the revolutionary communist youth brigade 
he was arrested in dallas in 1984 following a protest that ended 
in front of city hall with demonstrators pouring lighter fluid on 
and igniting an american flag authorities said was taken from a pole 
outside a bank building the protesters chanted america the red 
white and blue we spit on you 
police said the demonstrators also overturned potted plants and 
spraypainted buildings during a destructive march through the city 
but the only crminal charge was against johnson for violating a 
state law that forbids the desecration of a venerated object if 
that is likely to cause serious offense 
police officers who arrested johnson said they were seriously 
offended by the flag burning also an employee of the us army 
corps of engineers said he was so upset that he collected the 
charred fragments of the flag and later buried them in his backyard 
johnson denied he actually doused or ignited the flag but said 
he approved the action and gave speeches during the rally he said 
he was singled out for prosecution because dallas police knew he was 
a member of the revolutionary communist youth brigade 
johnsons jury conviction was overturned by the texas court of 
criminal appeals which said the flag burning was a form of symbolic 
speech protected by the constitution 
the appeals court did not overturn the law itself leaving open 
the possibility that flag burning in some cases would not be a form 
of speech and could be prosecuted 
many states and the federal government have laws against 
desecrating the flag but their enforcement is spotty 
the supreme court in 1943 ruled that the government may not 
compel citizens to salute the flag the justices in 1974 threw out 
the conviction of a college student who taped a peace symbol onto a 
flag 
but the high court previously had not ruled on whether outlawing 
the desecration or destruction of the flag violates the constitution 
civil libertarians and some famous artists rallied to johnsons 
support while not backing his political views they said laws like 
the one in texas could permit prosecutors arbitrarily to decide what 
is permissible dissent some said for example the law could be 
used to outlaw the burning of a flag in a movie about antiwar 
protests 
veterans groups and conservative organizations that supported the 
texas law said the government should be allowed to ban destructive 
conduct that threatens the flag as a symbol of national unity 
in the newspaper case the court voted 63 to throw out the award 
won by a rape victim from a florida weekly newspaper saying it 
violated freepress rights protected by the constitutions first 
amendment 
in other action the court 
ruled that a federal law allowing public scrutiny of 
governmental advisory groups does not apply to the american bar 
associations role in picking federal judges 
voting 80 the justices allowed the abas deliberations to 
remain largely secret 
sent back to massachusetts courts a case involving state child 
pornography laws 
the court told the states supreme judicial court to decide 
whether a sinceamended state law can be used to prosecute douglas 
oakes 40 of holden mass for soliciting a child to pose in 
a state of nudity for pornographic purposes 
the ruling is a setback for oakes who had been freed from any 
criminal liability by the states highest court 
the flagburning case is texas vs johnson 88155

the supreme court ruled today that a federal 
law allowing public scrutiny of governmental advisory groups does 
not apply to the american bar associations role in picking federal 
judges 
voting 80 the justices allowed the abas deliberations to 
remain largely secret 
justice william j brennan in his opinion for the court said 
congress did not intend the abas confidential relationship with the 
justice department in selecting judges to be made public when it 
passed a law covering adivisory committees 
tipping the balance in favor of confidentiality brennan said is 
the risk that public disclosure of aba deliberations would infringe 
improperly on the presidents power to nominate federal judges 
but brennan stopped short of declaring that the constitutional 
doctrine of separation of powers between congress and the president 
guarantees the confidentiality of the deliberations 
todays ruling upheld a federal judges decision last year 
barring application of the federal advisory committee act to the 
abas standing committee on the federal judiciary 
the aba the nations largest lawyers organization has for some 
40 years played a key role in advising presidents on nominees to the 
federal bench 
the justice department asks the abas judiciary committee for 
confidential evaluations of possible judicial nominees the panel is 
the only nongovernment group that routinely is told of potential 
nominees before the names are made public 
aba evaluations are made public after a nomination is submitted 
to the senate although the substance of the deliberations 
generally remains secret 
the aba after interviewing lawyers judges professors and the 
nominee rates potential nominees as exceptionally well qualified 
well qualified qualified or not qualified the aba is not required 
to reveal who was interviewed or any specifics of the process 
a controversy over the abas role was ignited when the aba panel 
was divided over former president ronald reagans nomination of 
robert h bork to the supreme court in 1987 
republicans on the senate judiciary committee accused aba 
committee members of being politicallly motivated in questioning 
borks fitness to be a justice 
the senate defeated borks nomination after a long bittr fight 
in which opponents said he was too rigidly conservative 
the conservative washington legal foundation and public citizen 
a liberal publicinterest organization joined forces in seeking to 
compel the aba committee to reveal its deliberations 
the former reagan administration opposed the move the justice 
department last year said the federal advisory committee act is 
aimed at special groups and the aba panel does not fit into that 
category 
justice antonin scalia did not take part in todays ruling 
the cases are public citizen vs justice department 88429 and 
washington legal foundation vs justice department 88494

the supreme court in a case stemming from 
publication of a rape victims name today limited the power of 
states to punish the news media for reporting truthful lawfully 
obtained information 
by a 63 vote the court threw out a 97500 award against a 
florida weekly newspaper won by a rape victim whose identify was 
included in a published report about the crime 
the justices said the award violates freepress rights protected 
by the constitutions first amendment 
florida law makes it a crime to print publish or broadcast 
the names of victims of sexual offenses 
our holding today is limited justice thurgood marshall wrote 
for the court 
we do not hold that truthful publication is automatically 
constitutionally protected or that there is no zone of privacy 
within which the state may protect the individual from intrusion by 
the press he said 
the decision also did not preclude the possibility of a state 
punishing publication of a sex offense victims name marshall said 
we hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful 
information which it has lawfully obtained punishment may lawfully 
be imposed if at all only when narrowly tailored to a state 
interest of the highest order 
that interest was not present in the florida case marshall said 
the florida star a newspaper that primarily serves the black 
community in jacksonville could have been put out of business if 
forced to pay the award its lawyers had told the justices 
the star obtained the rape victims name identified in court 
documents only by the initials bjf from a report posted in the 
sheriffs department press room in the fall of 1983 
most news organizations including the florida star have 
policies against publication of rape victims names but publication 
of bjfs name occurred erroneously the newpapers lawyers said 
the victim sued the sheriff and the newspaper she won 2500 
from the sheriff and 97500 from the paper 
in tallahassee fla mitch franks an assistant deputy state 
attorney general said the attorney generals office will review the 
decision when it is received and then make appropriate 
recommendations to state lawmakers and prosecutors he said he was 
uncertain of the impact of the decision without seeing the full 
opinion 
we would urge in the interest of protecting the victims of 
crime that the news media continue to adhere to their policy of not 
publishing the names of rape victims he said 
the publisher and editor of the star were both out of the office 
this morning and unavailable for comment said a newsroom employee 
in reversing the award the high court noted its past decisions 
on the tension between the right which the first amendment accords 
a free press and the protection which various statutes and 
commonlaw doctrines accord to personal privacy 
the court in 1975 barred states from imposing sanctions for the 
publication of truthful information contained in official court 
records open to public inspection 
the information in that case also was a rape victims name 
a 1977 decision struck down a state law that barred the news 
media from publishing the name or photograph of an 11yearold boy 
in connection with a juvenile court proceeding reporters had 
attended 
and in 1979 the court invalidated a state law that made it a 
crime for newspapers to publish withut written approval of a 
juvenile court the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender 
even if that information were obtained lawfully 
in todays decision marshall noted that the florida law does not 
make it a crime for a private citizen to maliciously spread word of 
the identity of a rape victim the law only targets such 
identifications by an instrument of mass communication 
when a state attempts the extraordinary measure of punishing 
truthful publication in the name of privacy it must demonstrate its 
commitment to advancing this interest by applying its prohibition 
evenhandedly to the smalltime disseminator as well as the media 
giant marshall wrote 
he added without more careful and inclusive precautions 
against alternative forms of dissemination we cannot conclude that 
floridas selective ban on publication by the mass media 
satisfactorily accomplishes its stated purpose 
the state law served as the basis of bfjs negligence lawsuit 
marshalls opinion was joined by justices william j brennan 
harry a blackmun john paul stevens and anthony m kennedy justice 
antonin scalia concurred in the result 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor and byron r white dissented 
writing for the three white said i would find a place to draw 
the line higher on the hillside a spot high enough to protect 
bjfs desire for privacy and peace of mind in the wake of a 
horrible personal tragedy 
he added there is no public interest in publishing the names 
addresses and phone numbers of persons who are the victims of crime 
and no public interest in immunizing the press from liability in 
the rare cases where a states efforts to protect a victims privacy 
have failed 
the case is the florida star vs bjf 87329

senior leader deng xiaoping of china said the 
united states used troops to quell student demonstrations during the 
1960s and should not criticize china for its crackdown on 
dissidents a hong kong newspaper reported 
the englishlanguage south china morning post on tuesday 
published the full speech deng delivered to senior military 
officials on june 9 five days after the army entered beijing to put 
down the prodemocracy movement 
portions of the speech which were broadcast on national chinese 
television had been reported previously the newspaper did not say 
how it obtained the full text of the speech 
deng noted that washington has criticized china for suppressing 
students but said the united states also mobilized troops against 
student rioters in the 1960s and 1970s 
they were suppressing students and the people but we are 
quelling counterrevolutionary riots what qualifications do they 
have to criticize us he said 
in his speech deng said the prodemocracy protesters hoped to 
topple the chinese communist party and to overthrow the socialist 
order of course these slogans are just a front their goal is 
to establish a totally westernized bourgeois republic 
deng said that in the course of quelling the rebellion many 
people died 
china has maintained that less than 300 people died about half 
of them soldiers western intelligence sources and chinese students 
have estimated that up to 3000 may have been killed in the june 34 
incident 
no matter how heavy our losses and in spite of the change of 
generations this army of ours is forever an army under the 
leadership of the party forever the defender of the country 
forever the defender of socialism forever the defender of public 
interest deng said 
he indicated in the speech that the studentled protest movement 
which lasted seven weeks was inevitable 
this storm was bound to come sooner or later we are 
fortunate that it has come about now mainly because we have a large 
group of senior comrades who are still alive they have experienced 
many storms and they know the cause of effects of things the 
84yearold leader said 
deng stressed that the basic concept of reform and openness for 
the past 10 years is correct and indicated that china wants to 
maintain economic ties to the rest of the world without reform 
and openness how could we have what we have today 
he said the results of the economic reforms that began in 1979 
should be carefully assessed we must persist in the coordination 
between a planned economy and a market economy there cannot be any 
change in this policy what is important is that we should never 
change china into a closed country 
he urged more investment in china even if it involves heavy 
debts 
however less than two weeks after dengs speech japanese 
foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka said it will put a halt to all 
economic aid negotiations with china japan supplies 80 percent of 
the international credit china receives 
on tuesday washington announced it was tightening diplomatic and 
financial pressure on china including postponing new loans

vietnam on wednesday turned over the 
remains of 28 people believed to be american servicemen and it 
plans to give us officials another 16 sets of remains 
maj dan trout a us military spokesman said a 21member us 
military team received the remains at a ceremony at hanois 
international airport he said it was learned that 16 other sets 
would be turned over to the united states but no date has been set 
wednesdays release was the 10th since august 1987 when a senior 
delegation to hanoi obtained promises from the vietnamese to step up 
efforts to resolve the issue of americans missing in action 
vietnam has repeatedly said it hopes to establish diplomatic and 
economic ties with the united states the unresolved mia issue as 
well as vietnams occupation of cambodia have been major barriers 
to this 
hanoi has promised to pull all its troops out of cambodia by the 
end of september and has dramatically improved cooperation on the 
mia issue us military teams have been allowed into the vietnamese 
countryside in joint mia searches and the number of turnovers of 
remains has increased 
in a recent interview with the associated press in hanoi foreign 
minister nguyen co thach said it was conceivable that 
usvietnamese links could be forged in 1990 
trout said the 28 remains were delivered in wooden boxes 
inspected by a us forensic expert and then transferred to aluminum 
caskets an honor guard saluted as american flags were placed on 
each casket the caskets were loaded onto a c141 transport 
aircraft which flew them to hawaii for identification at a us 
military laboratory 
since august 1987 212 sets of remains have been turned over and 
56 have been identified as americans 
the defense department says 2353 americans are still listed as 
missing in action from the indochina war 
some americans believe vietnam is also holding living americans 
but hanoi has denied this 
the united states in the past accused vietnam of releasing 
remains at politically oportune moments hanoi in turn has accused 
washington of using the mia issue to punish vietnam by linking its 
resolution to economic aid and establishment of diplomatic ties

south africas governing party leader fw de 
klerk began a european tour wednesday the highestranking south 
african to visit since president pw botha came in 1984 
forty members of the opposition labor party signed a motion in 
the house of commons urging prime minister margaret thatcher not to 
see de klerk who is expected to become south africas president in 
september 
they described the visit as unwelcome untimely and damaging to 
the prospects of dismantling apartheid in south africa and 
establishing peace in southern africa 
de klerk became head of the national party in february shortly 
after botha suffered a stroke 
botha the head of government since 1978 has indicated he will 
step down as president after parliamentary elections in september 
the national party which is virtually certain to win the polls 
designated de klerk as bothas successor 
de klerk said at heathrow airport he looked forward to meeting 
mrs thatcher the wests most outspoken opponent of imposing tough 
sanctions on south africa 
this year after visiting two of south africas neighboring black 
states zimbabwe and malawi mrs thatcher pledged to increase 
contact with south african leaders she said that is the best way of 
pressing for an end to apartheid and the release of black leader 
nelson mandela 
asked if he thought mrs thatcher could help end south africas 
isolation de klerk said i dont want to comment on her specific 
role 
she has always taken a principled stand from her viewpoint and 
we dont want to misuse her in any sense of the word whatsoever 
de klerk added 
basically the state of relations between britain and south 
africa has always been good and we hope that it will remain so and 
obviously we hope that it will improve 
de klerk also will go to west germany italy portugal and 
switzerland 
he will meet west german chancellor helmut kohl in bonn on 
thursday and then return to london for talks with mrs thatcher on 
friday 
de klerk is the highestranking south african official to visit 
britain since botha came five years ago during that visit botha 
declared that apartheid is dead 
he returned home to install a new constitution that ensured 
continued rule by the white minority 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services

us and soviet arms delegates on wednesday held 
the first full meeting in a new round of negotiations to cut each 
sides longrange nuclear arsenals by up to half 
the bush administration was expected to propose verification 
measures aimed at speeding progress on a treaty with the soviet 
union but it was not clear when or in what detail the us side 
presented its proposals both sides were observing an official news 
blackout in geneva on the substance of the talks 
soviet spokesman alexander melnik suggested it was too early to 
say where the round is headed 
bush on monday proposed that the united states and soviet union 
should begin testing verification procedures during negotiations on 
reducing longrange nuclear forces rather than waiting until a pact 
is completed 
the new chief soviet arms negotiator yuri nazarkin said he 
would wait for formal submission of the proposal before commenting 
on tuesday soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said a treaty 
reducing each sides longrange or strategic forces is part of 
the next phase in disarmament 
the basis for this already exists and the oustanding questions 
are not insurmountable as far as we are concerned if the two 
parties make the necessary efforts gorbachev said 
nazarkin and the new us chief envoy richard burt led their 
delegations in the first plenary session of the 11th round of talks 
a 2hour session at the us mission the strategic arms reduction 
talks began in march 1985 
no date was announced for the next session 
the round due to last about six weeks began monday with a 
meeting of the two delegation heads 
rapid progress in the talks appears unlikely since both sides 
have opposing positions on at least three major issues the us 
plan for spacebased missile defenses the longrange sealaunched 
cruise missiles and the mobile intercontinental missiles 
along with efforts on an arms treaty negotiations are also 
resuming on space and defense 
the soviets want to link agreements in the two areas but 
washington has refused 
under the bush plan both sides would begin tackling the tricky 
problem of verification early by testing onsite monitoring 
procedures during the talks rather than after the treaty is 
finished 
the talks aim at a treaty reducing us and soviet longrange 
bombers missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 to 50 percent 
many parts of the draft text have been agreed including lower 
ceilings of 6000 nuclear warheads and 1600 delivery vehicles 
missiles and bombers for each side

communist china has always had difficulty 
persuading its students and scholars to return home from abroad to 
an uncertain economic academic or personal future 
now after the suppression of the prodemocracy movement it may 
be impossible 
the result could be a continuing and damaging brain drain for a 
nation whose leaders have been trying to bring it fully up to modern 
standards 
since the june 34 military crackdown in beijing the major host 
countries for chinese students have announced that chinese may 
extend their stays 
the united states home to half of the 80000 chinese studying 
abroad says they can stay at least another year canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney told the nations 4000 chinese students 
they can stay until the situation in their country stabilizes 
britain is extending visas for its 3500 chinese students as are 
new zealand west germany japan and france australia says nearly 
all of the 10000 students there have inquired about prolonging 
their stay 
i would say that all of them will stay if possible said tian 
kun a former university of maryland student who returned to china 
after obtaining us citizenship 
before june most gave up their motherland because of economic 
reasons chinese scientists or engineers who could command high 
salaries in the united states had little incentive to return to 
china for jobs that pay less than 200 yuan 54 a month 
the newspaper economic information recently acknowledged many 
stay away because of a lack of suitable jobs in china and a rigid 
seniority system that stifles their talents many also fear they 
never will be permitted to go abroad again it said 
many fear the more threatening prospect of being drawn into the 
vortex of political repression thousands of chinese abroad marched 
in demonstrations or expressed sympathy for the democratic goals of 
the students in tiananmen square many face certain repercussions 
from political indoctrination to jail if they return 
if china becomes a democratic country i will go back said 
qian songnian a physicist at dartmouth college but in this 
situation certainly not 
the chinese government which began sending students abroad a 
decade ago under senior leader deng xiaopings opendoor policy has 
generally shrugged off the braindrain problem 
the government says about 90 percent of the 35000 statefunded 
students aboard will come home many have little choice the united 
states and other countries have ensured that students do not 
overstay their visas and students usually are forced to leave their 
families behind in china 
the government has far less control over private students 
usually younger and more independent who receive scholarships or 
financial support from overseas relatives 
many private students will try to transfer to canadian schools 
after their american visas expire miss tian said they will 
think of everything they can to avoid coming back 
china so far has shown no signs of stopping its foreign studies 
programs partly because the children of senior leaders are among 
the beneficiaries senior leader deng and communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang are two of the many officials whose children 
have studied abroad 
china however has tried to tighten controls by limiting 
scholarships to older postgraduate students with greater job and 
family ties at home last year universities sent only 600 students 
abroad while 4000 went from research centers and institutes

president bush will veto major childcare 
legislation being advanced by senate democrats and a republican if 
it reaches the white house in its present form the administration 
said today 
a letter from the office of management and budget distributed on 
capitol hill said the multibilliondollar package before the senate 
violates all of the presidents principles 
the letter said the revised measure before the senate was an 
improvement over the original bill but remained fundamentally 
flawed it said the measure would restrict parental choice in 
child care provide assistance only to families who pay for child 
care and discriminate against lowincome parents who have other 
family members care for their children 
the white house is backing an alternative republican package the 
omb letter said that if the plan favored by the senates democratic 
leadership were presented to the president his senior advisers 
would recommend that he veto it 
the statement was distributed as senate gop leaders sought 
support for the alternative debate on the issue continued in the 
senate today but no votes were scheduled until thursday 
the criticisms in the omb letter were similar to those raised by 
many republicans during the senates five days of debate on the 
issue the points prompted sen orrin hatch a utah republican who 
cosponsored the democratic bill to lash out at his gop colleagues 
im ashamed when i hear some of the arguments that ive heard 
on this floor hatch said tuesday accusing critics of spreading 
misinformation and disinformation and distortions 
i have no respect for people who distort the facts hatch 
said we have an obligation to tell the truth and let the chips 
fall as they may 
hatch who has been critical of the bush administrations 
competing child care proposal said he believed provisions of the 
presidents taxcredit package could be merged with the revised act 
for better child care sponsored by hatch and sen christopher dodd 
dconn 
this should not be a partisan political issue hatch said 
were willing to do what it takes to get a child care bill and we 
dont care who gets the credit for it 
republican leader bob dole had planned to offer a white 
housebacked alternative to the abc plan on tuesday but held off as 
the gop leadership sought support from southern democrats 
it relies almost exclusively on tax credits including an 
expansion of the existing earned income tax credit for lowincome 
families with children under the age of 5 like the doddhatch 
proposal the dole alternative would provide upfront money to 
families that otherwise could not take advantage of the existing 
dependent care tax credit because of low income 
dole also called for a 400 million block grant program states 
could use to fund programs designed to improve the quality and 
quantity of child care and borrowing a proposal from sen william 
armstrong rcolo dole proposed exempting child care earnings from 
the outside income limitations faced by social security recipients 
dole and other republicans have touched on their plan during the 
four days of senate debate democrats joined by the gops hatch 
have called it inadequate while offering to merge its tax credit 
provisions with the direct subsidies provided to parents and child 
care providers under the abc plan 
benefits under bushs plan would be available mainly to those 
making under 10000 a year the democratic subsidies would be 
available according to formulas determined at the state level 
an aide to senate majority leader george mitchell predicted 
doles effort to substitute his proposal for the doddhatch measure 
would fail senator mitchell has proven in the past that he knows 
how to count the aide said 
mitchell unable to reach agreement with republicans on a 
timetable to bring the issue to a final vote warned he would delay 
a twoweek senate recess due to begin next week if debate and 
amendments prevented a final vote by friday 
this is a very important matter mitchell said were going 
to stay as long as it takes 
with dole holding his plan the highlight of tuesdays debate was 
hatchs angry criticism of fellow republicans and conservatives 
waving a copy of a circular distributed at a republican caucus 
that attacked the doddhatch bill hatch said he did not mind 
arguments over honest disagreements but added i mind people who 
try to win their case with falsehoods he said the letter was on 
paper without a letterhead i do not know who prepared this piece 
of junk 
as revised the abc bill would authorize 175 billion for child 
care programs in fiscal 1990 with 70 percent of the money going to 
lowincome parents to help them pay for child care the remaining 
funds would go to states for programs to improve the quality and 
quantity of available child care

the supreme court in a partial victory for the 
internal revenue service in its legal battles with the church of 
scientology today made it easier for the government to conduct 
taxfraud investigations 
the justices ruled 80 that judges privately may examine 
communications between lawyers and clients to determine whether such 
information should be turned over to the government 
but the justices in a victory for the scientologists also 
upheld a ruling that permits judges to prevent information sought by 
the irs from being turned over to other government agencies 
the vote on that issue was 44 but the breakdown in line with 
supreme court tradition on tie votes was not disclosed 
justice william j brennan did not take part in the case 
the government which has had numerous legal battles with the 
scientologists began an investigation in 1984 of the tax returns of 
the churchs founder l ron hubbard he died on jan 24 1986 
the irs said it suspected that millions of dollars in church 
funds were transferred to hubbard in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
in a scheme to protect the churchs taxexempt status and avoid 
paying taxes on the money 
the irs issued a summons in october 1984 for 13 confidential 
documents held by a california state court in connection with a 
private lawsuit involving the church 
a federal judge ruled that five of the documents should be turned 
over to the irs but only on condition the irs not disclose the 
contents to any other government agency except in connection with a 
criminal tax prosecution 
that part of the judges ruling was upheld by todays tie supreme 
court vote 
the judge also blocked the irs from obtaining the other eight 
documents particularly taped conversations of confidential 
lawyerclient communications 
the san franciscobased 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld 
all of the judges ruling in 1986 
the appeals court said the government is not entitled to see 
attorneyclient communications unless it can produce independent 
evidence that the lawyer is taking part in a fraud 
the supreme court today unanimously overruled the appeals court 
on that point 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said the 
lawyerclient tapes may be examined by the trial judge in the 
privacy of his office to determine whether there is evidence of 
fraud 
the case is us vs zolin 8840

authorities on wednesday refused to 
allow 40 christian youths and newspaper reporters to attend a 
festival in north korea saying their participation would harm 
national interests 
the refusal confirmed an earlier ban on south koreans taking part 
in the 13th world festival of youth and students scheduled july 18 
the pyongyang gathering is not in conformity with the 
governments basic unification policy and is detrimental to our 
national interest national unification minister lee hongkoo told 
reporters 
he added however that seoul will continue to encourage contacts 
with north korea that do not harm south korean interests 
lee said senior government officials turned down the requests 
from 40 christian youths and journalists 
the decision came after authorities denied entry visas to three 
festival delegates who wanted to travel to seoul 
delegates from belgium jamaica and uruguay were refused entry 
visas by the south korean consulate in hong kong and were not 
allowed to board a korean air plane delegation leader theo celens 
said by telephone from hong kong 
celens a belgian representing the viennabased international 
union of socialist youth said his delegation wanted to urge seoul 
to let south koreans join the festival 
our intention was to have a neutral contact he said adding 
the festival committee did not want only radical south koreans but 
a balanced delegation 
north korea has invited about 500 south korean students and 
dissidents to join in the sports cultural and political event 
attended mainly by students from third world and communist nations 
seoul accuses pyongyang of using the festival to dramatize its 
demand for the withdrawal of us troops based in south korea under 
a mutual defense treaty 
the festivals organizing committee said wednesday the south 
koreans could attend as observers if their government was concerned 
about the festivals political nature according to the official 
north korean central news agency monitored in tokyo 
we have given assurances that we would not do anything that may 
impose a political burden on the south korean youth and students 
participating in the festival and that we had no intention to use 
them politically it quoted the committee as saying

the nations mayors today adopted a 
statement deploring recent supreme court decisions that they say 
weaken affirmative action 
the us conference of mayors also called for higher federal 
taxes and a ban on possession of semiautomatic weapons 
before wrapping up their annual conference the mayors also 
settled an unprecedented contested race for the conferences future 
leadership choosing democrat ray flynn of boston over republican 
william althaus of york pa 
the mayors overwhelmingly voted down an effort by some florida 
mayors to soften the language of their resolution on 
antidiscrimination in employment 
mayor cecil bradbury of pinellas park fla argued that whites 
have been victims of discrimination through efforts aimed at 
encouraging minority employment 
but the mayors sided with republican william hudnut of 
indianapolis who argued that without affirmative action the good 
ol boy network will favor whites 
the mayors said recent supreme court decisions are making it 
more difficult to ensure equal opportunities in employment for all 
americans 
among the other statements the mayors called for higher federal 
taxes to cut the deficit and allow more urban aid and urged a ban 
on possession of militarytype semiautomatic assault weapons 
the fiveday meeting of mayors from around the nation neared an 
end one day after the session erupted into partisan namecalling 
with new yorks ed koch launching a bitter tirade against the 
republican national chairman 
flynn was elected chairman of the organizations advisory 
committee an unglamorous title but a job that puts him in line to 
be president of the conference in 1991 
the vote was cast largely along party lines 6735 although 
houstons kathy whitmire a democrat and incoming president of the 
group sided with the republican 
flynn said the issue was whether the mayors wanted an outspoken 
critic of president bush who would challenge republican policies 
whitmire from bushs texas has said she is optimistic about the 
new administration 
i dont think this is time for mayors to sit back and just go 
along to say everythings all right in our cities everything is 
not all right in our cities flynn said 
the contest for advisory committee chairman was thrown to the 
full conference when two democrats sided with the republicans and 
deadlocked a nominating committee that for 57 years has settled such 
matters in private 
the meeting where partisanship is often submerged in discussions 
of common urban needs saw party bickering flare when lee atwater 
the gop national chairman spoke monday 
even some republicans complained about his blunt partisan speech 
including atwaters statement that he was targeting kochs 
reelection race 
arriving tuesday koch denounced atwater as amoral and a 
pathological liar he said atwater bore responsibility for the 
republican memo that attacked house speaker tom foley with 
homosexual innuendo and had lied in denying it 
he may be the best hired gun in the world but he carries with 
him all of the things that america hates which is lowlevel 
disgusting tactics vile things koch said of atwater 
democratic national chairman ron brown who previously called for 
atwaters resignation also addressed the group tuesday and laced 
his speech with blasts at atwater brown accused his republican 
counterpart of having taken politics to the lowest level of my 
lifetime 
thanks to the lee atwaters of the world national politics is 
looking more and more like the coastline of valdez alaska brown 
said make no mistake they want the political oil spill of 
negative campaigning to spread across america 
in washington rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman said we assume 
ed koch has said all these things because hes in a heated race for 
mayor she had no comment on browns remarks 
the partisanship combined with the unusual leadership race 
dominated discussions among the mayors 
indianapolis republican mayor william hudnut who on tuesday had 
said he was embarrassed and disappointed by atwaters remarks 
criticized brown on wednesday 
i just think politicizing the meeting is wrong and ron was as 
guilty as lee was hudnut said 
he noted that many mayors are elected in races where no party 
affiliation is listed and said the conference shouldnt invite 
national party chairmen again 
we work very hard not to be partisan in this organization 
added althaus who was working to avoid a partyline vote in his own 
race since democratic mayors outnumber republicans 
the race was for the job of chairman of the conferences advisory 
committee it carries an unglamorous title but the job is third on 
the groups leadership ladder and means the winner will be scheduled 
to assume the post of president of the conference and leading 
spokesman for the nations mayors in 1991 
the race had partisan dimensions because a victory by althaus 
would mean the conference would have two consecutive republican 
leaders for the first time ever 
republican mayor bob isaac of colorado springs colo has the 
job and is scheduled to be president in 1990 following democrat 
kathryn whitmire of houston who was to assume the presidency today 
after a year as vice president 
the mayors were ending their meeting having barely mentioned the 
scandals involving the department of housing and urban development 
which is beset by allegations of influence peddling and disclosures 
of embezzlement 
we cant let the republicans turn housing programs for the poor 
into subsidy programs for wealthy republican consultants brown 
said in one of the few public airings of the issue this week

four people including a fatherdaughter team of 
lawyers ran a babyselling scheme that bilked 100 couples of 
500000 authorities charged 
only 50 couples got babies state attorney general robert abrams 
said tuesday some others who had paid up to 16000 got neither a 
child nor a refund after being told the mother miscarried or changed 
her mind he said 
authorities said the brokers actually were selling the babies to 
the highest bidder doing business in such places as the parking lot 
of an international house of pancakes 
the mothers mostly unwed teenagers from rural areas were lured 
through ads in the star a supermarket tabloid and offered help 
with adoption counseling free medical care and financial support 
the adoptive couples were middleclass people from urban areas in 
21 states and canada 
seymour fenichel and his daughter deborah fenichel greenspan 
both lawyers and harriet and lawrence lauer all of new york city 
were indicted on 144 counts 
the four pleaded innocent tuesday to charges of grand larceny 
conspiracy fraud perjury filing false documents and making false 
statements by illegally operating child haven of northeastern 
pennsylvania a private adoption agency 
abrams said neither the mothers who gave up their children nor 
the adoptive parents face charges officials also said it was 
unlikely the mothers would try to get the children back 
partly because the four defendants used a legitimate social 
worker to process the adoption cases through the courts the 
attorney general said he felt the children were in good hands and 
the adoptions were not reversible 
the lauers attorney harvey baum said our clients 
involvement with adoption agencies have sprung from their own 
experiences in overcoming great obstacles in obtaining their own 
children in adoption 
their actions were always generated from good intentions and to 
help others who had the same problems they had he said 
mrs lauer wrote an article for good housekeeping magazine in 
1979 about getting her younger daughter through a classified ad 
fenichel was released on 100000 bail his daughter on 2500 
the lauers were released and given two weeks to raise 10000 bail 
the most serious charge carries a maximum of seven years in 
prison and a 5000 fine or double the amount illegally gained 
abrams said he would seek restitution for the couples

the government today said the 
15weekold guerrilla siege of jalalabad had ended with a government 
victory and that troops were pushing the insurgents toward pakistan 
guerrilla leaders denied that the bloodiest battle in the 
decadelong war was over 
there was no way to independently verify either claim 
jalalabad the capital of nangahar province and once the 
countrys fifthlargest city came under rocket and artillery 
bombardment march 7 three weeks after soviet troops left 
afghanistan and ended their nineyear intervention 
we have conquered jalalabad from the opponents said foreign 
ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani quoting the provinces 
military commander gen asif delawar 
in pakistan where the insurgents are based guerrilla spokesman 
azim nasserzia of the moderate national islamic front of 
afghanistan said of the government claim its certainly not 
true 
abdul rahim a spokesman for the more fundamentalist 
jamiatiislami added the siege is not over but if theyre 
talking about opening part of the jalalabad highway that may be 
true he also spoke from pakistan 
he was referring to the battles for control of the key supply 
route between pakistan and kabul the capital government forces 
have succeeded in pushing through any number of supply and weapons 
convoys but the guerrillas have periodically regained control and 
sealed off the road 
an editor for the afghan news agency an organ of hardline 
guerrilla leader gulbaddin hekmatyar called the report 
propaganda he did not want to be quoted by name 
amani said government forces had pushed the guerrillas about 15 
miles east the governments mopping up operations are still 
continuing every day we are able to destroy deserted rebel posts 
bunkers and their other hideouts he said 
day by day the number of attacks on jalalabad is decreasing 
rapidly the foreign ministry spokesman said more and more 
people are coming to their fields to work this is a definite sign 
that things are getting better and normal there 
however he added government troops still need time to clear the 
area 
there may still exist isolated rebel positions on the outskirts 
of the city he said our military aim is to push the rebels 
further toward the frontier and we are succeeding 
jalalabad which had a population of 64600 is 75 miles east of 
kabul and 45 miles west of pakistan 
when the siege began guerrilla leaders predicted the city would 
fall in three days giving them a base for an interim government and 
paving the way for the final drive to kabul 
the rebels captured several key outposts in the early fighting 
but they failed to unite into a cohesive force capable of mounting a 
sustained attack 
the guerrillas have been fighting to topple the sovietbacked 
government since it seized power in an april 1978 coup more than 
13 million afghans have died in the fighting 
also today foreign minister abdul wakil said the us state 
department should send a representative to kabul to negotiate the 
release of a captured american photographer 
the government initially did not name the photographer 
identifying him only as a us journalist rebel sources in pakistan 
identified him as tony obrien a freelancer from santa fe nm on 
an assignment for timelife inc 
the government later acknowledged today on staterun radio kabul 
that it was obrien who was being held 
radio kabul said obrien was captured june 8 on the outskirts of 
kabul rebel sources in pakistan however claimed the arrest was 
made june 14 it was not possible to clarify the discrepency 
the government accused the photographer of illegally entering the 
country without a visa and being in company of armed guerrillas 
at least three western journalists and two foreign aid workers 
have been captured while traveling with rebels during the war all 
were released unharmed obrien is the first american captured

suburban chicago heights violated an 
antidiscrimination law when its city council blocked construction 
of a home for mentally retarded adults the us justice department 
alleges in a lawsuit 
it is the first lawsuit brought by the department alleging 
housing discrimination against the handicapped under the fair 
housing amendments act that took effect march 12 the agency said in 
a news release 
at issue is a may 1 vote by the city council in the southern 
suburb of 32000 people denying a specialuse permit for 
construction of a home for 15 mentally retarded adults in a 
neighborhood of singlefamily and twofamily homes the department 
said 
the complaint filed tuesday in federal court in chicago 
contends the council denied the request because of neighbors 
opposition based on fears and prejudices the statement said 
under the new fair housing act stereotypes and baseless fears 
concerning the handicapped cannot be used to block the development 
of group homes said james p turner acting assistant attorney 
general in charge of of the civil rights division in the statement 
issued in washington 
studies have shown that these facilities are better for 
residents than the outofsight outofmind institutions of the 
past and that they have no adverse effects on the neighborhood 
turner said 
james creswell corporation counsel for chicago heights did not 
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the lawsuit 
chicago heights police commissioner john gliottoni one of the 
five council members would not comment on the merits of the case 
because of the lawsuit 
but he said the council followed the lead of the citys zoning 
board and its plan commission in the decision 
they are the sounding boards gliottoni said of the two 
panels they listen to all the people who are for it and all the 
people who are against it we as council members have no input 
whatsoever 
he said both groups denied zoning approval and the council 
followed those recommendations as it does more than 99 percent of 
the time 
the justice department statement said the building permit was 
sought by rfms inc a galesburg company that specializes in 
developing homes for the retarded there was no answer at a 
telephone number listed for rfms

the supreme court by a 54 vote today gave 
railroads greater leeway to sell off rail lines without first 
entering into collective bargaining about a sales effects 
the court resolving one of the most critical issues facing the 
nations railroad industry said the pittsburgh amp lake erie 
railroad or pample may sell its 182 miles of rail line in eastern 
ohio and western pennsylvania without first negotiating with its 
employees unions 
interpreting the railway labor act a federal law governing the 
railroad and airline industries the court said the pample was not 
obligated to bargain over the effects of the sale including lost 
jobs 
the pample having lost 60 million in the five previous years 
announced in 1987 that it had agreed to sell its trackage and other 
assets for about 70 million to a newly formed subsidiary of the 
chicago west pullman transportation corp 
the subsidary intended to operate the railroad as the pample had 
except that it would not assume the pamples union contracts and would 
lay off about 500 of the railroads 750 employees 
when the unions were notified of the sale they challenged it as 
a violation of the railway labor act the interstate commerce 
commission however approved the sale 
a federal trial judge and the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that the pample was legally obligated to negotiate with its 
unions about the sales effects on the workforce 
today the supreme court said the lower courts were wrong 
after the sale was postponed the pample sought a new purchaser 
todays decision also makes that pursuit easier 
writing for the high court justice byron r white said the pample 
was not obligated to postpone its sale of the trackage beyond the 
time the sale was approved by the commission and was scheduled to be 
consummated 
he added to the extent that the unions demands could be 
satisfied only by the assent of the buyers they sought to change or 
dictate the terms of the sale and in effect challenged the decision 
to sell itself 
at that time pample was under no obligation to bargain about the 
terms it had already negotiated white wrote 
white was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and harry a blackmun dissented 
but by a unanimous vote the court left unresolved and sent back 
to the 3rd circuit court for further study the related issue of 
what authority federal courts have to block strikes in such cases 
the cases are pittsburgh amp lake erie railroad vs railway labor 
executives association 871859 and pample vs rlea 871888

two of six black candidates won judgeships 
in elections ordered by a judge who said mississippis judicial 
districts discriminated against blacks 
mississippi now has five blacks among its 78 judges a gain of 
one after tuesdays elections one incumbent lost 
in spite of some black leaders allegations that there is no 
more discrimination in mississippi these election results are clear 
indication that discrimination is alive and well in mississippi and 
will probably be around for some time to come said attorney 
carrol rhodes 
rhodes was one of the lawyers who represented blacks in a 1986 
federal lawsuit that resulted in the redrawing of judicial districts 
in mississippi 
voting patterns along racial lines if it has been changing 
its becoming more pronounced he said it just shows that we 
have a lot more work to do 
mississippians on tuesday also finally removed from the state 
constitution an unenforcable poll tax that was enacted years ago to 
keep blacks from voting but was struck down by the us supreme 
court in 1966 
with 98 percent of the vote in unofficial returns had 99648 
voting for repeal of the tax and 72844 against repeal 
the states four black judges are supreme court justice reuben 
anderson circuit judges fred l banks jr and lillie 
blackmonsanders and chancery judge isaac byrd 
each was appointed to fill a vacancy but anderson went on to win 
a full eightyear term in 1986 he was not up for election tuesday 
byrd did not seek election banks was unopposed and blackmonsanders 
was challenged 
blackmonsanders lost to republican challenger richard watson 
12878 votes to 9600 one other black democrat isadore w patrick 
of vicksburg was unopposed in the general election 
the two black winners in contested races were pat wise a 
democrat who defeated republican billy w keyes for an open hinds 
county chancery judges post 5942 votes to 1638 and denise sweet 
owens also a democrat who defeated republican george m arthur in 
another open family court post 4628 votes to 1259 
black candidates solomon curtis osborne clell g ward and harold 
brittain all lost to incumbents 
i am disappointed with the situation as it now exists outside 
of jackson said former state sen henry kirksey of jackson one 
of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that resulted in the redistricting 
jackson is the county seat of hinds county and the state capital 
kirksey said the voting vindicated his complaints about the 
redrawing of some of the districts he also said there wasnt enough 
time to persuade black voters to cast ballots only for black 
candidates 
us district judge william h barbour jr ruled in 1987 that 
mississippis judicial districts discriminated against blacks the 
ruling the first to apply the 1965 voting rights act to judicial 
elections was upheld on appeal

subdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity to 
elect black judges 
sixteen elections were contested tuesday those elected will take

three parents withdrew their children 
from a daycare program after the children saw nude photographs at a 
museum exhibit during a field trip 
victoria mcdowell said she took the children ages 39 last week 
to where the boys are an exhibit at the childrens museum at 
sunrise but was surprised to find photographs of naked men and 
women 
j hornor davis the museums executive director said hundreds 
of children had toured the exhibit in school groups without 
complaint we dont feel the current exhibit is in any way 
pornographic or gratuitous he said 
we went in to the room to the right and there scattered in 
among the artwork were some black and white photos of naked men 
said mcdowell 
i told the kids we must be in the wrong section so we went to 
the other side and there were some photos from the rainbow family 
festival of naked men and women standing in front of tents and on 
creek banks mcdowell said i took the kids upstairs and it was 
the same up there 
mcdowell said three parents withdrew their children when she told

a federal judge today refused to accept a 
guilty plea from a company indicted for water pollution demanding 
pennwalt corp send its top man rather than the three executives 
it flew in from philadelphia 
the case involved a 1985 spill into tacomas hylebos waterway in 
which at least 75000 gallons of a cancercausing chemical escaped 
from a ruptured 180000gallon storage tank that had been poorly 
maintained 
an undetermined amount of the chemical reached the waterway in an 
overflow last year 
in a plea bargain pennwalt agreed to pay 11 million for the 
spills 
before i accept this plan the top officer of your company will 
be here not a division the top man us district judge jack 
tanner told pennwalt senior vice president marty schwartzberg 
in addition to schwartzberg pennwalt sent a senior vice 
president for legal matters and president of the companys inorganic 
chemical division 
tanner had told attorneys in may that he would not accept the 
plea unless a pennwalt executive was present but he didnt specify 
which executive 
assistant us attorney david marshall told the judge that he was 
satisfied that schwartzberg and another of the executives are very 
high in this company and should be able to answer any questions the 
court has 
pennwalt lawyer tom kelly argued it was very unusual to compel 
executives to appear in such cases usually a company pleads 
through its attorneys 
people in this company have had deterrence imprinted on their 
memory through this investigation kelly said there will be 
deterrence here your honor 
tanner however cited statistics indicating washington ranks 
second in the country in the number of such reported pollution 
violations 
apparently deterrence is not being very effective he said 
the judge rescheduled the plea hearing for july 19

the photograph of german women staring 
longingly at a pile of sausages in a store window captures the 
essence of the aerial foodline provided by the western allies 40 
years ago in defiance of the soviet blockade of berlin 
the photo belongs to an exhibit that opened wednesday at the air 
and space museum to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the berlin 
airlift mounted at the height of the cold war by the united states 
england and france 
the airlift guaranteed the liberty and survival of the free 
part of berlin said west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher who opened the exhibit 
known by welcoming berliners as the raisin bombers the 
planes of the airlift kept alive the western occupied sectors of the 
city during a 15month siege directed by soviet leader josef stalin 
more than 277000 flights carried 23 million tons of supplies to 
west berlin by sept 30 1949 when the soviets gave up and reopened 
roads rails and waterways some 78 aircrew members were killed in 
crashes and other incidents 
while the airlift kept the city going rations were meager 
robert kimener a retired navy captain who spoke at the opening 
of the exhibit said he was astonished to learn that each family got 
only 25 pounds of coal for the winter 
kimener a pilot in a small naval air contingent that flew in the 
airlift said he visited a family in january 1949 whose berlin 
apartment seemed colder inside than the winter weather outside even 
though he wore his flight jacket 
the average daily ration of food consisted of 352 ounces 
including 15 ounces of meat 
we blockaded berliners arent starving but were always 
hungry an unidentified survivor is quoted as saying in the 
catalogue which describes the 60 photographs and airplane models 
shown in the exhibit 
heroes of the airlift known affectionately by air crews as 
operation vittles include the socalled chocolate pilot an 
american who dropped chocolates in handkerchief parachutes to 
children of the blockaded city in christmas 1948 
soviet forces acting on a plan of stalin to force the western 
allies out of the city halted all ground transportation into west 
berlin on june 24 1948 and cut off berliners from food fuel and 
other supplies 
within two days us forces started an airlift that grew to a 
nonstop series of cargoplane takeoffs and landings every 90 seconds 
at berlins three airports 
one photograph shows berlins socalled rubble women hauling 
debris from world war ii destruction to build makeshift runways and 
increase available landing strips 
the supplies including coal milk and other rations moved 
though narrow air corridors from west germany over the 
sovietoccupied east zone that has become communistcontrolled east 
germany 
so tight were the flying schedules that planes failing to find 
their landing strip immediately had to return to west germany fully 
laden and try again later 
included in the exhibit are cartons and cans of shortening 
coffee and powdered hot chocolate some marked as gifts from the 
people of the united states 
former pilot kimener said air crews were in competion to carry 
the most cargo and make the most flights 
fatigue was our constant companion said kimener who 
recounted that a soviet plane once shot at his aircraft and that 
soviet decoy beacons lured at least one american plane to 
destruction

a us serviceman who once had been 
described as a model soldier pleaded guilty wednesday to charges he 
gave defense secrets to east germany 
spec 4 michael a peri changed his earlier plea of innocent just 
as his courtmartial began said army spokesman maj samuel taylor 
peri 21 of laguna niguel calif could be sentenced to life in 
prison on the espionage charge 
the charges were filed against peri after he disappeared from the 
11th armored cavalry regiment in fulda in february 
at the time military officials said they were baffled because 
peri had a reputation as model soldier and at one point had been 
recommended for a soldier of the month award for his superior 
performance peri returned voluntarily 11 days later 
he was charged on march 16 with espionage officials said he had 
given communist east germany secrets on us plans for the defense 
of west germany 
peri dressed in a us army uniform walked with his head bowed 
into the fulda us army community center where the courtmartial 
began he was not handcuffed but was escorted by military police 
taylor said military officials had not expected peri to change 
his plea 
peri also pleaded guilty to charges of being absent without leave 
and entering a restricted area near the east german border without 
permission 
the prosecution agreed to drop charges of larceny against peri 
after he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of wrongful 
appropriation of a portable computer and a military vehicle he 
used during his absence taylor said 
peri stationed in west germany since march 1988 had worked as 
an electronics warfare signal specialist 
after his return us military officials said the east germans 
themselves notified american authorities that peri had made contact 
with them 
the 11th armored cavalry regiment in fulda peris home unit 
comes under control of the us armys 5th corps the cavalry unit 
is responsible for frontline defense along west germanys border 
with east germany 
the courtmartial judge col craig c jacobson ordered the 
public out of the courtroom while specifics of the secret 
information peri allegedly gave to the east germans were discussed 
a board of military officers will be selected thursday to hear 
testimony that will help determine the length of peris sentence

chinese students in the united states urged the 
bush administration wednesday to step up economic pressure on the 
beijing government and announced plans to assemble in washington 
next month to write a constitution for a free china 
the only language the chinese government can listen to is 
economic sanctions said ding xueliang 36 a sociologist and 
graduate student at harvard university 
at a news conference at constitution hall ding and a dozen other 
chinese student organizers unveiled the formation of an umbrella 
group the alliance of chinese patriots to represent their 
prodemocracy colleagues in the united states they also disclosed 
new tactics to get news into china of the governments brutal 
crackdown on the movement 
the information effort according to zhang ya qin a student at 
george washington university will include random mailings from 
cities around the world and the transmission of newspaper and 
magazine photos and articles to 1000 fax receivers throughout 
china the students also intend to begin publishing in new york 
their own bimonthly magazine called china archives 
as for the argument that a suspension of trade and development 
assistance would only weaken western influence and deprive the 
chinese people ding asked how can you imagine that a government 
which kills its own people would use foreign currency to benefit its 
people 
president bush froze us military sales to china in the wake of 
the bloody june 4 attack against student demonstrators in beijing 
and elsewhere and on tuesday he took steps to block at least 14 
billion worth of international development loans china still 
retains mostfavorednation trade status with the united states 
however and calls have escalated in congress for him to take 
sterner measures 
speaking just hours after shanghai authorities executed three 
protestors ding and his colleagues said thousands of chinese 
students in the united states already have signed a declaration of 
principles calling for a constitutional convention in exile the 
us immigration and naturalization service said recently there are 
73000 chinese with active us student visas 
ye ning a student at american university said a 
constitutional convention can be the banner of the chinese people in 
their fight for freedom the government is now trying to put the 
genie back into the bottle and it will find that very difficult 
no date has been fixed for the gathering to be attended 
principally by chinese law students but it will occur sometime next 
month said ding weve received strong moral support from 
congress and legal scholars in the united states he said we 
believe in the united states we have learned from your 
constitution 
the declaration circulated by the group says as the world 
watches we the chinese people are today engaged in an epic 
struggle to cast off the chains that have bound us for two 
generations the present system has been tried in china and has 
failed it has produced hunger where there should be plenty 
corruption where there should be integrity servitude where there 
should be freedom 
it listed these principles that guide our struggle for 
freedom 
1 every individual is born with equal and inalienable human 
rights 
2 the basic right of every individual is the right to be free 
the right to plan and live his or her own life this right entails 
all other rights including the rights of speech press assembly 
association religion property and privacy 
3 to secure these rights individuals create government to 
which they give only as much power as is necessary to secure their 
rights 
4 a government is legitimate only if it rests on the consent of 
the governed 
5 the people retain the right to deny legitimacy to their 
government by withdrawing their consent

a rightwing party and communistdominated 
alliance on wednesday discussed forming a coalition government aimed 
at cleaning up alleged corruption under the rule of defeated premier 
andreas papandreou 
the consultations began as judicial investigators named two of 
papandreous former cabinet ministers in a bribery inquiry and asked 
parliament to lift immunity so that they can be prosecuted the two 
ministers named are former deputy premier agamemnon koutsogiorgas 
and public order minister george petsos 
at the same time koutsogiorgas wife aliki was among three 
people charged with involvement in the alleged payment of a 2 
million bribe to koutsogiorgas 
the reports of bribery and corruption involving leaders in 
papandreous panhellenic socialist party led to its defeat in 
sundays parliamentary election 
conservative leader constantine mitsotakis and harilaos florakis 
the leader of a communistdominated alliance said the prosecution 
of those involved in the scandals dominated their talks 
we remained absolutely agreed on one thing the issue of 
catharsis and the scandals must not be written off said florakis 
whose alliance holds a decisive hand in forming a coalition 
government 
the dominant issue now is catharsis and political developments 
must be oriented toward this objective mitsotakis said 
latest election results announced wednesday gave mitsotakis new 
democracy party 145 seats in the 300member parliament six seats 
short of the required majority papandreou who has led greece since 
1981 won 125 seats florakis alliance took 29 seats 
the postelection posturing has taken on new significance in the 
light of the corruption inquiry 
under the greek constitution only the present or subsequent 
parliament has the power to lift the ministers parliamentary 
immunity and prosecute them if no new government is formed and a 
new election is called those elected parliamentarians would be 
unable to prosecute them 
mrs koutsogiorgas was charged with opening a joint swiss bank 
account with her husband where a bribe was deposited the indictment 
said the 2 million was a bribe to koutsogiorgas who was also 
justice minister for approving a banking law that helped hide 
irregularities in the bank of crete 
also charged were bank owner george koskotas and kosotos lawyer 
yannis mantzouranis 
mantzouranis who also was the secretary of papandreous council 
of ministers was charged with arranging the bribe and with keeping 
an unspecified amount of the 2 million 
koskotas was charged with embezzling the 2 million and with 
bribing koutsogiorgas he is in prison in the united states awaiting 
the hearing of an extradition demand by the greek government 
no date was announced for a judicial hearing against those 
charged 
in the parliamentary request the magistrates accused 
koutsogiorgas of accepting bribes while in office and petsos with 
accepting gifts 
parliament speaker yannis alevras said the evidence against the 
two ministers would be kept secret until its presentation to the 
first session of the new parliament scheduled for july 3 
consultations to form a coalition government are expected to 
continue until next week each of the three party leaders is given 
given three days to try to accomplish this with mistotakis having 
the first go

an indiana air national guard pilot 
killed during an emergency landing after he blacked out would have 
been grounded if officials had known he had high blood pressure a 
national guard bureau report says 
first lt david e kruse had lied to flight surgeons concealing 
his medical problems for years so he could fly f4e phantom 
fighters assigned to the 122nd tactical fighter wing at baer field 
said the report released tuesday in washington 
had the military medical staff been aware of the extent of 
kruses civilian medical problems he could never have been 
medically qualified for flying duty investigators said 
medical report forms indicate kruse hid his blood pressure 
problems from military doctors even though he had been a patient at 
the hypertension research center at indiana university medical 
center 
kruse fainted after shoveling snow dec 27 1988 and his doctor 
advised him to tell a flight surgeon about the blackouts the report 
said 
adj gen jack k elrod of the indiana national guard has ordered 
flight surgeons to review the medical records of all flying 
personnel 
kruse 26 of fort wayne blacked out about 10 minutes after 
declaring an emergency and smoke in the cockpit during a feb 10 
night training flight he was about eight miles from the runway when 
he lost consciousness 
maj wilburt j elliott 39 the weapons systems officer took 
control from the jets rear seat and landed however the plane 
swerved off the runway damaging the nose gear and activating an 
automatic ejection system 
an autopsy by allen county coroner philip e oshaughnessy found 
kruse suffered a broken neck back and legs and internal bleeding 
all of which were enough to kill him 
the autopsy showed no signs of smoke inhalation 
we dont know why he passed out said chief deputy coroner 
robert cummins he was ejected and then thats when he suffered 
the injuries naturally 
cummins who stressed he is not a doctor said kruse could have 
passed out for any number of reasons theres so many things that 
could have caused that something wrong with the plane the oxygen 
in the plane but certainly the high blood pressure may have been 
a factor he said 
elliott who also was ejected suffered minor injuries 
the report concluded the emergency kruse reported involved a 
hydraulic problem that corrected itself before he blacked out the 
cause of the cockpit smoke was not given

two of every five american women giving birth 
to their first children werent married when they became pregnant 
the census bureau said wednesday a rise over the past two decades 
the bureau also found a jump in the birth rate among women in 
their 30s noted that a majority of the women having a baby in the 
year ending in june 1988 were in the work force and said minorities 
tend to have higher birth rates 
in all the bureau said the national fertility rate was 697 
births per 1000 women aged 18 to 44 in that year those are 
considered the prime childbearing ages 
fertility rates have remained at about 70 births per 1000 women 
during this decade and the figure for 1988 is not considered 
significantly different from the 71 recorded the year before 
but changes have occurred among the women becoming mothers in 
america 
for women aged 15 to 29 the bureau found 40 percent of their 
firstborn children from 1985 to 1988 were conceived out of 
marriage up from just over 30 percent when the measure was first 
taken from 1970 to 1974 
the 40 percent of new mothers who conceived out of wedlock 
included 117 percent who got married before the child was born and 
283 percent who were still unmarried when the baby arrived 
the major change was among that second group the women who were 
still unmarried when the baby arrived they increased from 179 
percent of all firsttime mothers in the early 1970s to the 283 
percent recorded in 1985 to 1988 
this shift may reflect the opinion of some women that they may 
be better off in the long run by relying more on the support of 
their parents and relatives for financial and emotional assistance 
than by entering a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solely 
to prevent an outofwedlock birth bureau analyst amara bachu 
said in the report 
at the same time that the share of unwedmothers was rising the 
percentage of women conceiving while single and then getting married 
before the arrival of the baby dropped from 149 percent to 117 
percent of first mothers 
the share of unwed first mothers varied sharply by race the 
study also found 
among black women 746 percent of first births to women aged 15 
to 29 occurred out of wedlock from 1985 to 1988 up from 541 
percent for 1970 to 1974 
for hispanic women the rate was 306 percent up from 267 
percent earlier and white women had 196 percent outofwedlock 
births up from 115 percent 
the new report also confirmed the widely reported trend of women 
postponing births as they pursue education and careers 
the increases in childbearing among women over 30 suggest 
that childless women now more than in the past are deliberately 
postponing their childbearing to older ages the report said 
for women aged 30 to 34 the 1988 fertility rate was 816 births 
per 1000 women up from 60 in 1980 and 564 in 1976 a similar 
though smaller increase was reported for women 35 to 39 
the bureau also asked women about their plans for families and 
noted that among childless wives aged 25 to 29 85 percent still 
expect to have a child at some point thats up from 75 percent who 
expected a future birth in this age group in 1975 
still the study concluded the question remains how strong is 
the commitment to childbearing after remaining married and childless 
for several years 
for women aged 18 to 44 the study reported that 509 percent of 
women giving birth in 1988 were in the work force up from 508 
percent a year earlier and just 38 percent in 1980 
labor force participation among women with newborn children is 
appreciably higher for collegeeducated women that for women with 
less education the report found 
among new mothers with college degrees nearly 60 percent were in 
the labor force compared with 49 percent of high school grads and 
34 percent who had not finished high school 
by race 59 percent of black mothers were in the labor force 
compared with 50 percent of whites and 37 percent among hispanics

the nations economy continues to grow but 
there are ebbing rates of expansion in some regions the federal 
reserve said wednesday in a report that suggests the central bank 
need not push up interest rates 
the survey of economic conditions around the country indicated 
that growth is slowing and inflationary pressures have eased in 
response to an antiinflation campaign launched by the fed in march 
1988 
thats what the central bank sought to produce from its 
15monthlong effort to curb inflation by pushing up interest rates 
to cool off the economy earlier this month the fed eased up 
slightly and made a small move to loosen its grip on credit in the 
belief that the slowing economy would help tame price increases 
consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 67 percent during the 
first five months of 1989 up from price increases of 44 percent 
during 1987 and 1988 but many analysts believe that inflation may 
begin to level off and decline later this year 
the survey based on comments submitted by the feds 12 regional 
banks painted a picture of an economy in which slower growth could 
help ease upward pressure on prices caused by tight labor markets 
and strained factories 
economic activity for most of the nation continues to advance 
but a number of federal reserve districts note ebbing rates of 
expansion the survey said 
with some exceptions wage and price pressures are not 
accelerating some districts said their respondents had not been 
able to pass their input costs increases through to their 
customers 
the economic survey known as the tan book will be used when fed 
policymakers meet july 56 to decide future monetary strategy the 
central bank tries to control inflation through its decision on how 
much money it makes available to the banking system 
economist cynthia latta of data resources inc in lexington 
mass said the survey suggests the fed may have more luck with a 
soft landing than a lot of people think in a soft landing growth 
slows enough to restrain inflation without toppling the country into 
a recession 
i would think that they fed officials will pat themselves on 
the back for a job well done up to this point but theres nothing 
in here that tells them they need to loosen aggressively ms 
latta said of the survey it just says expansion is ebbing which 
is what the fed wants 
the survey reported that while auto sales have dipped retail 
sales generally are positive 
manufacturing growth is leveling off real estate markets are 
sluggish and agriculture is benefiting from recent rains that have 
helped alleviate drought conditions in some areas the survey said

attempt to kill italys most celebrated mafia fighter when they 
discovered a bomb near his villa news reports said 
security forces assigned to protect judge giovanni falcone 
reportedly found 44 pounds of plastic explosives stuffed inside a 
waterproof bag 
the guards part of a 24hour security detail noticed the bag on 
a sunbathing platform at the edge of the sea about 20 yards from 
the villa the bag was the type used by divers to store their gear 
experts blew up the bomb 
the italian news agencies ansa and agi quoted explosives experts 
who examined the bomb as saying it was clearly meant to kill the 
judge or his family who frequently went for swims in the morning 
news agencies said investigators theorized that the potential 
assassins had set up a surveillance base either in one of the nearby 
villas or in a boat offshore they theorized the bomb would have 
been set off when falcone went down the walk leading to the sea 
when the bomb was discovered falcone was about to leave the 
villa for a morning workout at a health club his guards rushed him 
instead to his heavily guarded office in palermos palace of 
justice it was not reported whether other members of his family 
were home at the time 
falcones investigations of the mafia have led to hundreds of 
convictions he reportedly receives frequent threats and his 
security precautions are among the tightest in italy 
for his summer stay at the villa guards have been stationed 
along the road that runs above the villa and police motor launches 
periodically patrol offshore 
mafia members who turned informants have reportedly said that 
falcone is the top target of the organization

firefighters laboring in 100degreeplus heat today contained a 
desert wildfire near the grotesquely shaped trees of californias 
joshua tree monument in florida rain helped crews battling a blaze 
in the dry everglades 
the 935acre blaze in the desert raged within 1000 feet of homes 
and was the largest of four fires that burned 1500 acres in 
southern california before being contained 
a predicted high of 118 degrees brittle vegetation and 
capricious winds were expected to keep 375 firefighters on the fire 
lines all day 
one firefighter suffered burns on the face said state forestry 
department spokeswoman deborah mcclellan 
the fire burned away from the joshua tree monument a rugged area 
named for the trees with daggershaped leaves and branches like 
upraised arms the joshua tree is common to the southwest 
the fire started tuesday prompting authorities to order the 
evacuation of 85 homes as flames bore down on a neighborhood in the 
city of joshua tree but the fire was stopped short of the houses 
and most people had returned by late in the day 
the residents had cleared the brush around their homes and if 
it hadnt been for that clearance the homes would definitely have 
burned said mcclellan 
one outbuilding was destroyed in the sparsely populated area 110 
miles east of los angeles 
in florida rain brought firefighters closer to putting out a 
wildfire that has scorched 43700 acres of the everglades nearly 
400 firefighters from at least seven states battled the blaze which 
has been fed by wind and dry grass 
if things work like theyre working now id say two to three 
days information officer sam logan said tuesday if all of a 
sudden it dries up and we get some crazy winds it could do 
something else 
the area is so dry that alligators have abandoned secluded 
marshes in the arthur r marshall loxahatchee national wildlife 
refuge floridas largest for a canal on its rim as a result the 
refuge has been closed to boaters and fishermen 
in california a 175acre brush fire in the hills above san 
clemente was contained at 8 am and firefighters earlier doused a 
300acre blaze in the newbury park area of ventura county and a 
115acre fire in san bernardino countys devore area

the united states deeply regrets chinas 
execution of three men in the crackdown on prodemocracy forces but 
the administration is not considering additional sanctions against 
beijing secretary of state james a baker iii said today 
there is an important relationship which we should seek to 
preserve if we possibly can baker told reporters that is a 
consideration that must be taken on board when we consider what 
specific actions should be taken 
baker spoke with reporters outside the white house as he 
accompanied visiting west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher to a luncheon 
we deeply regret the fact that these executions have gone 
forward notwithstanding appeals from the united states appeals 
from the federal republic of germany and perhaps other countries 
for clemency baker said 
asked whether the united states would impose additional sanctions 
in retaliation for the executions in shanghai he said the united 
states is not contemplating any additional action at this time 
baker said president bush believes that sanctions already in 
place are the proper response to the bloody crackdown in china and 
the arrests of more than 1600 prodemocracy demonstrators eight 
protesters in beijing also have been condemned to die 
tightening diplomatic and financial pressure on china bush took 
steps tuesday to block at least 14 billion in development loans 
while he said china is gripped by an atmosphere of suspicion and 
reprisal 
hours after the us actions were announced chinese authorities 
in shanghai ignored the international pleas for clemency and shot to 
death the three men who had been convicted of setting a train on 
fire they were the first reported executions since the crackdown 
began 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged today that 
china has not been influenced by the united states or other nations 
the weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of 
china and it does not appear to have made much difference he 
said adding that history has shown that they generally are not 
that responsive to outside kinds of pleas 
fitzwater said the united states could not afford to turn its 
back on china even though it deplores what is happening there 
everyone has to recognize first of all that this is a country 
of a billion people a sizeable portion of the worlds population 
that cannot be closeted off and ignored he said 
moreover he said china plays an important role in regional 
conflicts such as afghanistan cambodia and the iraniraq war and 
also is a nuclear power that possesses ballistic missiles 
its important that we have some perspective in viewing the 
overall longterm relationship with china and that we believe we 
have tried to strike the right balance fitzwater said 
genscher at a picturetaking session with the president was 
asked his reaction to the executions 
we are condemning the brutal genscher began his comment 
was interrupted by a white house aide who shouted an order that 
ended the photo session bush made no comment 
on bushs orders the united states will try to postpone 
consideration of new loans to china by international financial 
institutions 
one administration source said the action could freeze 14 
billion over the next six months from the world bank and 
international development bank other estimates indicated the figure 
could be even higher 
bush also curtailed contacts by us officials with their chinese 
counterparts ordering a suspension of all highlevel exchanges of 
government officials with beijing 
while not affecting embassytoembassy contacts it will force 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher to scrap a trip to china next 
month baker said 
this action is being taken in response to the wave of violence 
and reprisals by the chinese authorities against those who have 
called for democracy white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said 
the us hopes that the current tragedy in china can be brought 
to a peaceful end and that dialogue will replace the atmosphere of 
suspicion and reprisal fitzwater said china is an important 
state with which we hope to continue productive relations 
the latest action follows earlier orders for a freeze on military 
sales to china and a suspension of contacts by military leaders 
with the repression in china bush has been prodded by 
conservative and liberal members of congress alike to take tougher 
action such as withdrawing mostfavorednation trading privileges 
from beijing 
the administration has argued that china is impervious to 
pressure from the united states and bush has said he wants to 
refrain from commercial sanctions that would hurt the chinese people 
congressional del walter fauntroy ddc said at a house 
banking subcommittee hearing prior to bushs action that china has 
47 billion in loans pending or in the pipeline at the world 
bank and 11 billion being processed by the asian development bank 
the white house statement said bushs action was aimed at new loans 
to china so it was unclear how much money was involved

eighteen chinese refugees who arrived 
in the philippines by boat have asked for asylum in taiwan because 
they are afraid to return to their homeland officials said 
wednesday 
immigration chief miriam defensor santiago said the 16 men and 
two women would be turned over to the un high commissioner for 
refugees to determine whether they can be classified as political 
refugees 
ms santiago said the group mostly fishermen left the southern 
chinese province of guangdong on april 29 and reached the northern 
philippines on may 3 a month before chinese troops dispersed 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing they were brought to manila 
june 13 ms santiago said 
they apparently left china because they anticipated that 
trouble was brewing that there was going to be political 
commotion in the next few months ms santiago said 
and at the same time they left because of a desire to enhance 
their economic status she added according to the affidavits 
taken they do not wish to return to mainland china they are afraid 
that they will be punished or killed by authorities in the mainland 
they wish to go to taiwan because they think that there are better 
job prospects there 
seven of the 18 refugees went before reporters at ms santiagos 
office the others were being held at the headquarters of the 
philippine army 
when reporters asked why the refugees were afraid to return home 
one of them lim niet nee replied because we will be killed 
we want to go to taiwan or any other place other than china 
lim said through an interpreter 
karola paul deputy representative of the un high commissioner 
for refugees said un officials would interview the group and 
consult with un officials before deciding whether to certify them 
as political refugees 
in taiwan liao chenghao deputy director of the government 
information office said the nationalist government would not accept 
the 18 chinese until they are confirmed to be political refugees and 
not just people looking for a better life 
ms paul said the un high commissioner for refugees advised its 
regional offices on june 12 to expect a possible exodus of chinese 
refugees from the mainland following the june 34 crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing

a medicine commonly used to control epilepsy in 
pregnant women appears to cause minor birth defects and retardation 
raising a dilemma about how to prevent seizures that can also harm 
the unborn a study concludes 
other epilepsy drugs have already been linked with birth defects 
now researchers say that one called tegretol or carbamazepine should 
be added to the list 
the drugs manufacturer questioned the way the study was 
conducted and its conclusion 
physicians who treat women with seizures are in a very 
difficult position said ronald v lacro a coauthor of the 
study this is the drug of choice because it seemed to be safe we 
cant say that anymore 
the study found evidence that women who took tegretol during 
pregnancy were more likely to produce babies with delayed 
development and mental retardation they were also more likely to 
have unusual facial formations including upward slanting eyes 
long upper lips and short noses and incomplete development of the 
fingernails 
cibageigy the company that makes tegretol said the latest 
study is a reminder that the risks and benefits of anticonvulsant 
drugs need to be weighed carefully but that the medicine should 
still be considered for epileptic women who want to have children 
we feel that our past data show that tegretol is a good option 
for epileptic women we still feel that way said spokeswoman 
cathy kernen 
the study was directed by dr kenneth lyons jones of the 
university of californiasan diego it was published in thursdays 
new england journal of medicine 
studies have found that severe epileptic seizures during 
pregnancy can temporarily interrupt the flow of blood to the fetus 
causing brain damage however epileptic women have an increased 
risk of producing babies with minor birth defects even if they 
dont have seizures during their pregnancies 
counseling has to start before pregnancy for these women 
said lacro a pediatrician at childrens hospital in boston if 
the woman has severe enough seizures and needs the medicine then by 
all means you have to give it but there is no completely safe 
therapy other than being off medications 
the researchers first identified the pattern of birth defects in 
eight children who had been exposed to the drug before birth they 
confirmed it by evaluating an additional 48 children whose mothers 
had taken the medicine 
they found that 11 percent of those exposed had facial 
abnormalities 26 percent had incomplete finger nails and 20 percent 
were slow to develop 
only one of the youngsters with delayed development was old 
enough to take an intelligence test that child aged 6 had an iq 
of 65 
in a statement cibageigy criticized the study for serious 
methodological problems it noted that the doctors used women who 
did not have epilepsy in a comparison group the higher risk of 
birth defects among the children of the epileptic women might have 
resulted from the epilepsy not the medications it said 
lacro said i think that what we are seeing is due to the drug 
if the changes that we saw were due to seizures alone then we would 
see the same pattern of malformations for all kinds of seizure 
drugs i think the defects are drug specific but i cant prove 
that

nervous about falling under chinese control 
residents of hong kong are applying for temporary visas to the 
united states at an accelerating rate 
but most of those wanting to move permanently from the worlds 
thirdlargest financial trading center are looking to other 
countries 
last year applications for nonimmigrant or temporary visas 
to visit the united states averaged 650 a day since chinese troops 
fired on prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square june 34 
the daily total has risen above 1000 the state department said 
wednesday 
there were no figures available on permanent immigration but a 
department official said other countries were preferred because us 
law restricts entry to aliens with close family ties to americans 
occupations in demand here or other specific qualifications other 
countries are more lenient 
telephone calls for information to the us consulate in hong 
kong have increased but most hong kong residents are well aware of 
the us rules the official said 
britains 99year lease on hong kong expires in 1997 under terms 
worked out with the chinese in 1984 the agreement specifies that 
hong kong would retain its status as an intenrational financial 
center 
the us consulate reported to the state department that 
residents were nervous about coming under prc peoples republic 
of china sovereignty and they have responded with an unprecedented 
demand for foreign visas said an official declining to be quoted 
by name were not getting the bulk of them 
last year congress reserved 4800 visas for wealthy immigrants 
from hong kong

a young mans suicide in despair over 
his homosexuality has led to a college scholarship in his memory 
and changed his mothers fundamentalist views 
the 500 scholarship in memory of bobby griffith will be offered 
beginning next year in contra costa county site of an acrimonious 
struggle between fundamentalists and homosexuals it is intended to 
encourage and give a sense of caring to gay students facing 
prejudice and hostility according to the organization that created 
the gift 
what we are saying to gay students is there is a gay 
community out there and we care about you said rob birle an 
antioch high school teacher and chairman of the contra costa county 
chapter of the bay area network of gay and lesbian educators 
the scholarship funded by donations will be open to 
heterosexual students though preference will be given to 
homosexuals 
i dont know why nobody ever thought of this before birle 
said there are scholarships for italians catholics hispanics 
and every other kind of minority so why not for homosexuals 
birle said he could find no similar scholarships around the 
country and the california teachers association said it never heard 
of one either 
so far 21 of the countys 23 high schools have agreed to include 
the scholarship in the list they offer students 
opposition is expected from the anaheimbased stop homosexual 
advocacy in education group which for more than a year has actively 
opposed school programs in contra costa that portray homosexuality 
positively 
but the anaheim groups activities and bobbys death prompted 
his mother mary griffith to give her blessing when birle asked if 
she would support the scholarship 
i really believed god would come to bobbys rescue and when he 
didnt i had to rethink everything she said monday 
mrs griffith was initially horrified by her sons homosexuality 
which she learned of when he was 16 within a year of his death 
mrs griffith quit her church she now is president of the diablo 
valley chapter of parents and friends of lesbians and gays 
depressed over his family and friends disapproval bobby 
griffith dropped out of high school two months before he was to 
graduate in 1981 he killed himself aug 27 1983 in portland ore

heathrow airport authorities are withdrawing 180 
press passes to improve security in the wake of the bombing of pan 
am flight 103 in december 
as of july 31 reporters photographers and camera crews will be 
barred from large areas of the airport where they had traditionally 
been permitted access 
heathrow airport ltd the airport authority said access 
generally will be restricted to essential personnel 
the reason for the withdrawals is that fewer numbers means 
fewer people that have to be searched questioned or monitored 
and greater attention can be focused on those who are airside 
said airport spokesman garry may it is not a review of media 
passes but a review of all passes 
may said the restrictions had nothing to do with stories 
questioning airport security written by reporters who had gotten 
jobs as aircraft cleaners after only minimal security checks 
nothing could be further from the truth the question is only 
one of security it has nothing whatsoever to do with press 
activities at this airport before lockerbie or after lockerbie he 
said 
a bomb hidden inside a radiocassette player exploded over 
scotland killing all 259 aboard and 11 residents of lockerbie

the world bank suspended new loans to china two 
weeks ago after the bloody crackdown on demonstrators by chinese 
troops though the bank is still paying out money on previous loans 
a spokesman said wednesday 
president bush promised on tuesday that the us government would 
use its voting power in the world bank and other international 
lending institutions to try to prevent new loans to china 
frank vogl chief spokesman for the bank said that new loans 
were suspended on june 8 and all but one of the banks eight staff 
members were pulled out of beijing although some have returned 
sheldon rappaport the banks financial spokesman estimated that 
on march 31 about 44 billion worth of approved loans to china had 
not yet been disbursed 
bank president barber conable a former new york congressman 
decided on june 8 shortly after the chinese crackdown not to 
submit new loans for final approval to the 22member board of 
executive directors which meets every week in closeddoor session 
representing 151 member governments 
as the biggest shareholder the us government has just over 18 
percent of the voting power and strong influence over many other 
members 
shahid burki a pakistani who heads the banks china desk is due 
back at the banks washington headquarters from beijing on monday 
with a report for conable and the board 
if economic chaos or some other reason was preventing a loan 
for irrigation from being properly spent for example we would not 
want to keep putting out the money vogl said in an interview 
the bank lends 2 billion to 25 billion a year to china the 
thirdlargest borrower after india and mexico 
pastor sison spokesman on asia calculated that 780 million 
worth of new lending for china was due for approval by the board 
before the banks fiscal year ends june 30 
the bank is planning to lend 20 billion to 21 billion this year 
to over 100 third world countries the usual rush is on to complete 
this program by the end of the fiscal year and the board has 
scheduled three meetings next week 
sison said it would be hard to transfer to other borrowers the 
amounts designated for china 
a spokesman at the international monetary fund the banks sister 
organization said it has no loans pending or being disbursed to 
china china does get loans from the asian development bank an

redfaced legislators met in an 
emergency special session wednesday to repass hundreds of spending 
bills that were ruled invalid because the legislature violated a 
requirement in the states constitution 
virtually all state spending will halt july 1 when arkansas 
fiscal biennium begins unless the legislators approve nearly 300 
appropriations bills all over again 
i am embarrassed veteran state rep jodie mahony said of the 
procedural snafu during the regular session which ended in april 
but it is an honest mistake 
the special session convened late tuesday one day after a 
specially appointed arkansas supreme court ruled that the general 
appropriation act did not pass with a threefourths majority as 
required by the states 115yearold constitution 
since the general appropriation act must be passed before any 
other spending bills may be enacted the ruling meant the state had 
not authorized a spending blueprint 
the fact that our state constitution is an amalgamation of 
anachronisms is no justification to ignore it arkansas gazette 
columnist john brummett wrote wednesday 
during the regular legislative session the general appropriation 
bill got a 6522 vote in the 100member house and a 259 vote in 
the 35member senate where 27 votes equals threefourths 
the house and later a senate rules committee decided that the 
general appropriation bill fell under the category of just 
debts which the constitution says is exempt from the 
threequarters rule 
a little rock attorney sam perroni then filed a friendly 
lawsuit challenging the general appropriation acts validity 
when a pulaski county chancellor rejected the just debts 
argument in ruling the appropriation act invalid the issue went to 
the state supreme court however the seven justices recused 
themselves citing a possible conflict of interest because the 
legislature appropriates funds for the high court 
a special sevenmember supreme court was appointed that also 
rejected the just debts argument so on monday night gov bill 
clintons staff began rounding up lawmakers to return to little rock 
the only legislators missing from the special session were a 
house member who was sick and another who was out of the country 
the constitution requires that all special sessions meet for at 
least three days and clinton said he hoped lawmakers could wrap up 
things thursday or friday 
to show his desire for nononsense action clinton decided 
against an opening speech for the session which is costing 
taxpayers an estimated 20000 a day 
i want to do it as quickly as possible keep it to this agenda 
and finish the governor said 
once in session lawmakers hastily assigned bill numbers and gave 
the familiar items two readings dispatching them to the joint 
budget committee where the panels cochairman rep john e 
miller pressured colleagues to grind out all spending bills in a 
twohour sitting 
understand this is a rehash the same thing and all of us 
know what we have done miller said were showing were not 
derelict in our duties 
its just unfortunate we are not as good constitutional lawyers 
as the supreme court said rep mike wilson a lawyer but i 
know there was a general good faith belief that it was properly 
passed 
the court ruling also invalidated an unpopular 119 million 
10year settlement of state liability in desegregation lawsuits 
surrounding schools in little rocks pulaski county the settlement 
passed by a narrow margin the first time around and opponents say 
they wont let it pass again 
sen stanley russ a member of the joint budget committee which 
recommended the settlement bill for passage wednesday predicted the 
bill would pass the senate but die in the house

the fbi is making violent crime a nationwide 
investigative priority to counter a 40 percent increase in such 
offenses in the 1980s director william s sessions said wednesday 
sessions told reporters that violent crime will rank with foreign 
counterintelligence terrorism drugs organized crime and white 
collar crime as major priorities of the fbi 
with the acknowledged 40 percent increase in violent crime the 
american public is understandably outraged by the growing disregard 
for human life by criminals sessions said 
while state and local police still have jurisdiction to 
investigate the vast majority of violent crimes sessions said the 
fbi can expand its role in this area 
for example recently enacted legislation gives the fbi expanded 
jurisdiction to investigate the killings of all state and local law 
police officers the fbi also has new jurisdiction under the drug 
law passed by congress last year to investigate murders related to 
drug trafficking 
in the past violent crime did not receive as i believe the 
kind of emphasis is should receive sessions said 
the new priority status of violent crimes will be certain to 
get the attention of sacs special agents in charge out there in 
the field who are allocating resources to the particular 
responsibilities sessions said 
the amount of time agents have spent investigating violent crime 
has dropped because of the other priorities that we have 
established i anticipate this will hold the line in any reduction 
in those numbers sessions said 
president bush has asked congress to appropriate 195 million to 
hire 300 new fbi agents as part of his anticrime package if 
approved we expect to apply those resources directly to the 
violent crime problem sessions said 
sessions meanwhile declined to say he was strongly confident 
that the fbi would find those responsible for the march 10 bombing 
of a van in san diego driven by the wife of the capital of the uss 
vincennes 
i cant express with strong confidence we will solve that 
particular crime but i hope we will be able to do it sessions 
said 
the blast did not injure sharon rogers the wife of capt will 
rogers iii whose ship mistakenly shot down an iranian jetliner in 
the persian gulf last summer 
by contrast sessions said he remained confident that 
investigators would solve the dec 29 bombing of pan am flight 103 
over scotland that killed all 259 persons 
the bombing is believed to be in retaliation for the us downing 
of the iranian jetliner that was carrying 290 people 
sessions meanwhile acknowledged there may have been a lapse 
in communications when attorney general dick thornburgh was not 
notified that fbi agents planned to interview rep william h gray 
iii dpa on memorial day 
the memorial day visit resulted in stories that the fbi was 
investigating an allegation of payroll padding on grays 
congressional staff the justice department has since said gray is 
not a target of the investigation but is cooperating 
last week thornburghs chief spokesman david runkel said that 
the attorney general should have been informed in advance of the fbi 
interview 
sessions said it is one of those things of which thornburgh 
should have been aware to me its very important that he be aware 
of those things that are problematic sessions said 
we try to have keep him informed sessions said i have no 
rationale or excuse to make in that connection 
but the director said i dont think there was a breakdown in 
communications i think there may have been a lapse there may have 
been some circumstances where communication was not fully conveyed

opponents of steel import restraints told 
president bush on wednesday that he should not feel bound by a 
campaign pledge to renew the trade barriers 
winston churchill used to say id rather be right than be 
consistent and i reminded the president of that sen phil 
gramm rtexas told reporters after the meeting at the white house 
regarding the import curbs that expire sept 30 
bush met privately with lawmakers who favor extending the trade 
program and with gramm and others who are urging it be dropped 
bush tipped his hand in no direction whatsoever said sen 
jay rockefeller dwva chairman of the senate steel caucus 
the reagan administration negotiated fiveyear 
productbyproduct voluntary restraint agreements in 1984 with 
japan south korea the european community brazil and other nations 
to limit the flow of foreign steel into the united states 
three days before last novembers election bush wrote a letter 
to sen john heinz rpa pledging to renew the program in some 
form but with the steel industry newly profitable opponents of the 
curbs say they can make a case for bush to end the barriers or at 
least narrow their scope 
wed like to think his normal inclination would be on the side 
of fewer barriers sen bob packwood rore told reporters after 
the meeting what hes going to do with that statement that he 
made in pennsylvania toward the end of the campaign i dont know 
but i suppose i could live with a compromise 
everything is different than it was in 1984 gramm said 
the industry is operating at 96 percent of capacity steel prices 
are rising very rapidly now especially for the smaller fabricators 
who do not have longterm agreements with the domestic steel 
industry the steel industry is profitable 
advocates of continuing the program argue that steel price hikes 
have been caused not by import barriers but by strong worldwide 
demand and shifting exchange rates 
the trade conditions that spawned the restraint program still 
exist rockefeller said 
america is playing by the right rules and everybody else is 
playing by protectionism and we get hurt rockefeller said 
he said the program must be extended so the steel industry can 
complete about another 10 billion of modernization that they have 
to complete in order to be competitive with the rest of world which 
is already subsidizing and dumping in united states 
the administration has not said when a decision will be made but 
heinz said he expected something in the next several weeks heinz 
and rockefeller said they attended the meeting on behalf of steel 
companies and steelworkers pressing for a fiveyear renewal of the 
program

environmentalists and 61 members of congress 
said wednesday that the us department of interior should sue exxon 
corp for damage caused to public land as a result of the exxon 
valdez oil spill 
rep robert g torricelli dnj led the delegation in its 
request that litigation be initiated against the companies 
responsible for the march 24 oil spill in alaskas prince william 
sound the largest oil spill in history 
my interest is not simple vengeance it is rather providing the 
only genuine incentive that will ever prevent the repetition of the 
valdez tragedy torricelli said at a news conference 
if the message to international oil companies is that 11 
million gallons of oil can destroy hundreds of miles of pristine 
shore and thousands of birds and animals and cost no more than a few 
months operating profit then we have no guarantees for the 
future torricelli said 
torricellis letter addressed to secretary of the interior 
manuel lujan jr asks that department the department of justice 
and other federal agencies to pursue legal action against exxon and 
the alyeska pipeline service 
a dozen environmental groups including the natural resources 
defense council the sierra club the wilderness society and the 
national wildlife federation sought the same action in a separate 
letter to president bush 
this is a key issue to determine if the federal government is 
at all serious about the environment said michael mcclosky 
chairman of the sierra club the guilty party should bear these 
costs not the government 
also wednesday sen harry reid dnev pleaded for a law that 
would deny exxon a tax writeoff for expenses of cleaning up the 
spill 
reid is chief sponsor of a bill that would prohibit exxon from 
deducting costs of cleaning up the spill unless the federal 
government certified the clean up meets standards of the clean water 
act or other federal laws

israeli warplanes destroyed the 
headquarters of a dissident palestinian guerrilla faction wednesday 
and the guerrillas reported one fighter killed and six wounded 
palls of dust and smoke billowed from the oak woods around 
naameh 10 miles south of beirut as guerrillas opened up with 
antiaircraft guns on fighterbombers that dived from clear skies 
the jets released scarlet balloons to deflect heatseeking 
missiles 
guerrillas launched one sa7 but the sovietmade projectile 
missed its target 
police said four warplanes struck two positions of the popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command in the bluffs 
of naameh 
a police spokesman said eight guerrillas were wounded 
a statement from the guerrillas headquarters in damascus 
reported one guerrilla killed and six wounded 
it said the raid lasted 105 minutes during which nine formations 
of usbuilt f4 phantom and skyhawk bombers dropped more than 100 
rockets 
the statement said guerrillas prevented several attempts to land 
airborne and seaborne commandos in the area where they maintain 
bases in a chain of tunnels across the naameh hills 
israeli gunboats were cruising the mediterranean and two 
helicopter gunships hovered over the beaches but reporters saw no 
attempt to land troops 
in jerusalem the israeli army said its planes returned safely 
from an attack on targets that served as the headquarters for 
ahmed jibril 
it was the third air raid on lebanon this week and the ninth this 
year 
on friday israeli warplanes bombed south lebanons rashidiyeh 
refugee camp wounding two children 
by police count nine people have been killed and 60 wounded in

liberation of palestine said its naameh base was hit but gave no 
details of damage or casualties 
habashs organization the secondlargest of the nine plo 
factions after arafats fatah pledged in a statement to continue 
the painful raids against the zionist enemy

monastery but the tunnel was not affected 
the base is only 500 yards east of the highway linking beirut 
with south lebanon 
panicking motorists deserted their vehicles and ran for cover in 
banana groves swimmers hurried to a nearby motel 
but naameh residents accustomed to israeli attacks climbed to 
rooftops to watch the planes 
lebanese militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatt blocked roads 
and fired automatic rifles in the air to keep reporters and 
photographers from stricken targets 
the naameh bluffs were the scene of a ninehour confrontation 
between jibrils fighters and israeli air naval and ground forces 
dec 9 eight guerrillas and an israeli officer were killed 
jibril said after that battle the helicopterborne paratroopers

an ultraright party that made a 
strong showing in voting for the european parliament is aiming for 
the federal parliament aided by millions of dollars in government 
campaign funds 
the republicans headed by a former waffen ss soldier have 
tapped an ultraconservative vein with strong nationalistic appeals 
and demands to virtually bury the nazi past 
the republicans won 71 percent of the vote and six seats in 
sundays balloting for the european parliament it was their first 
nationwide test 
the party has automatically improved its chances for the next 
elections said west german pollster wolfgang g gibowski 
nothing succeeds like success 
gibowskia a director of the independent forschungsgruppe wahlen 
polling organization of mannheim added a party that shows at the 
first shot it can get more than 5 percent of the vote will no longer 
be subject to doubts among voters about whether theyre wasting 
their ballot by voting for it 
five percent of the vote is the minimum needed for a party to 
gain seats in the bonn parliament and many people are predicting 
the republicans will succeed during national voting in december 1990 
the republicans will receive 82 million in campaign funds 
allotted by the government to various political parties 
founded in 1983 the republicans came to prominence in city 
elections in january in west berlin gaining 75 percent of the vote 
and 11 seats in the city legislature they ran on a platform to rid 
the city of foreign workers 
later the republicans picked up support in the few races where 
they fielded candidates in municipal elections in hesse state 
franz schoenhuber the former ss soldier who heads the 
republicans told thousands of cheering supporters in february that 
young germans should be absolved of guilt for the holocaust 
todays young generation of germans is no more guilty for 
auschwitz than the sons and daughters of americans who committed 
genocide at hiroshima and nagasaki schoenhuber said 
schoenhuber who claims the party has 16000 members has also 
railed against the common market as a threat to west german national 
interests and made strong lawandorder appeals that reportedly have 
gained support among police groups 
there have been clashes between leftwing demonstrators and 
police guarding republican rallies 
some critics accuse the republicans of having neonazi 
tendencies federal officials have refused to call them rightwing 
extremists which include various neonazi groups 
heinz galinski the leader of west germanys jewish community 
predicts the republicans will win 5 percent of the vote next year 
and sit in parliament 
the success of the republicans is not temporary galinski a 
76yearold survivor of auschwitz told the associated press we 
must figure in the future on having a further increase in the 
radical rightwing 
since sundays voting for the european parliament one main issue 
has been whether chancellor helmut kohls conservative christian 
democrats would form a coalition with the republicans to stay in 
power following the 1990 voting 
kohl rejects the idea schoenhuber denies he wants to work with 
kohls party but says he has had contacts in that direction from the 
chrisitan democratic partys more conservative bavarian sister 
party the christian social union 
were in the happy position of being the courted bride and not 
the flirtatious bridegroom schoenhuber said monday in summing up 
his view of where the party stands 
republican leaders also have announced they plan to move the 
party headquarters from munich to bonn to increase their profile 
while saying they will run in numerous state and local races before 
the 1990 national voting 
among the leftist politicians worried by the republicans high 
profile is gerhard schroeder head of the opposition social 
democratic party in the lower saxony state parliament 
he blamed kohls party for reviving hopes for the reunification 
of west germany and east germany especially during the recent visit 
of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that according to 
schroeder fueled the republicans own strident demands for 
reunification 
that is an appeal to national feelings that has nothing to do 
with reality schroeder said thats a chance for the 
republicans they thrive on that hope 
schroeder has called for a united front involving political 
parties churches and labor unions to carry out a campaign to halt 
the republicans he wants to target young people in particular to 
educate them about the ultraright

a nuclear submarine that snagged a 
towing cable and dragged a tugboat under killing a deckhand had 
failed to detect the 97ton vessel by sonar a federal investigator 
says 
the analysis by national transportation safety board investigator 
donald tyrell is based on interviews with the crew of the uss 
houston after the accident june 14 
tyrell in an interview in wednesdays long beach presstelegram 
said the tugs engine noises may have been masked by the sounds of 
larger ships in the area or the sub may have been in a spot where 
it couldnt pick up the tugs sounds 
requests for navy comment were referred to lt sonja hedley at 
the subs home port in san diego and she wasnt immediately 
available 
according to tyrell the 360foot sub was relying on passive 
sonar which allows tracking of vessels by engine and other noises 
this is normal for military subs tyrell said noting that active 
sonar which emits pings that bounce back and locate vessels 
more accurately give away a subs position 
the houston snagged the submerged cable linking the 73foot tug 
to two barges two crewmen swam to safety in the earlymorning fog 
but a deckhand was lost 
shortly before the accident the sub had helped in filming of the 
movie the hunt for red october

nearly a decade after the first of the child 
murder victims was found lawyers for wayne williams are headed 
back to court to try to show that the ku klux klan not williams 
was responsible for the deaths 
from july 1979 to may 1981 29 poor generally streetwise young 
blacks were found killed in and around atlanta one other is missing 
williams now 30 was convicted in 1982 of two of the deaths and 
is serving two life sentences authorities attributed 22 other 
killings to him the other cases remain classified as unsolved 
new york civil rights lawyer william kuntsler said he and others 
working on williams case will meet tuesday in atlanta to organize 
what he called the final thrust of their appeal and to request a 
new evidentiary hearing 
weve been collecting more and more information all of which 
points to waynes innocence he said wednesday from his new york 
office 
the prosecution has contended since williams was convicted that 
the evidence points to him and to nobody else but doubt has 
remained in the minds of many including the parents of some 
victims over whether williams was behind all of the killings or 
acted alone 
the georgia supreme court unanimously rejected an initial appeal 
of williams conviction in 1983 and later voted 61 not to 
reconsider 
in november 1985 kuntsler and others on the defense team 
appealed in butts county superior court in jackson where williams 
is imprisoned claiming authorities withheld vital information from 
the defense that might have exonerated the former freelance 
photographer and music promoter 
since then the case has remained dormant while defense attorneys 
sought information to support their contention 
what we have put together is the fact that there was a meeting 
in the governors office in which it was decided that they could not 
charge a white klan member without causing a race riot kuntsler 
contended wayne became the fall guy everything we have sustains 
that 
george busbee was governor at the time his secretary said he 
could not immediately comment wednesday because he was in meetings 
kuntsler said investigators have amassed more than 300 pages of 
new evidence that points away from williams 
we have as much as were going to get he said were going 
to reopen this case and get wayne out of there and go after the 
klan 
among evidence withheld he contends are wiretap recordings in 
which klan members admit that they did it and they boasted about 
it 
lewis slaton district attorney for fulton county where most of 
the killings took place said he was aware of nothing new in the 
case and added that the move appears to be a continuation of the 
appeal previously filed 
williams was convicted largely on the basis of fibers found on 
the victims that could be traced to the williams household carpet 
williams bedspread his dog and other sources 
prosecution witnesses testified that the odds of random 
duplication of that combination of fibers were 150 million to one 
joseph drolet of the fulton county district attorneys office 
who prosecuted the case said fiber evidence linked williams to 
about 20 of the cases and the same fiber combination has not been 
found on a murder victim since williams was arrested some victims 
were found in rivers or on river banks and were washed clean of 
evidence he said

president bush in a clarion call to community 
service urged young americans on wednesday to help rescue millions 
of homeless poor and other needy people who are free falling 
through society 
i need your help america needs your help bush told more 
than 3000 teenagers and children on the white house lawn 
it is a time of need for millions of americans said bush 
too many people are free falling through society with no prospect 
of landing on their feet 
no one young old white brown or black should be 
permitted to go through life unclaimed said bush you must show 
us how to reclaim these lives 
he made his appeal as part of his youth engaged in service yes 
to america drive to muster support for community service 
in new york on thursday he will unveil details of a wider 
national service initiative to encourage volunteers of all ages 
all backgrounds all abilities bush said 
aides said bush would urge virtually every institution in society 
to give a new push to volunteerism 
but on this steamy morning he aimed his message at the young 
from 5 to 25 saying all had something to give 
bush invoked the image of the bell in the church steeple that in 
a simpler time summoned neighbors to help 
when people heard that bell they didnt stop to ask why it was 
ringing they just came on horseback or foot by buggy or 
bicycle honking the horn of a model t they just came said the 
president whatever the problem whoever was in need of help they 
were ready 
the bells have been silent too long he said let them ring 
in your hearts and across the land 
commit yourselves listen to the bells make it your mission to 
make a difference in somebody elses life he said 
all of you have something to offer kids from tough 
neighborhoods kids from broken homes kids who have grown up on 
food stamps and handmedowns you each have a gift that america 
needs he said 
his remarks hit a receptive chord in the audience invited from 
boy scout troops church groups schools and other organizations 
already engaged in service 
hes preaching to the converted in my case said alexandra 
warren 19 of new hope pa who is spending this summer as a 
volunteer for common cause before her junior year at haverford 
college service is part of the quaker ethos at haverford she 
said 
shaka brown 12 a boy scout from washington dc said i 
just helped somebody a little while ago a young lady lost her 
nametag he helped her find it on the soggy and packed white house 
lawn 
as presidents in time of war called for young people to defend 
america bush said he was urging them to fight poverty homelessness 
and other ills 
he told congress in february he will seek 100 million over four 
years to endow a yes foundation to provide matching grants for 
community service projects 
bush said young people could find meaning and adventure in 
community service 
he listed sad statistics about americas youth 1700 drop out 
of school 4000 run away from home and 2700 become pregnant daily 
but he insisted youre not the problem you are the solution 
you dont need to be bribed with incentives and threatened with 
penalties to get engaged in community service he said service 
is its own reward satisfaction guaranteed 
he wants to save money said june shih 17 of st agnes 
school in alexandria va where the girls are required to perform 
40 hours of community service before senior year 
its good the 1000 points of light and everything said 
shih a red cross volunteer americas in the red he has to find 
some way to help the lessfortunate without straining the budget

namibias administrator wednesday 
refused to dismiss paramilitary policemen who have been accused of 
intimidating civilians and jeopardizing independence elections in 
the territory 
south african administrator louis pienaar told a news conference 
he will allow members of the recently disbanded koevoet 
counterinsurgency unit to remain in the regular police force 
members of koevoet which means crowbar in afrikaans wore 
military uniforms and traveled the bush in armored personnel 
carriers they are known for often brutal tactics against supporters 
and guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization which 
has fought 23 years to end south african rule of namibia 
koevoet was made up mostly of black namibians led by white south 
africans 
pretoria which has ruled namibia for 74 years has agreed to a 
yearlong transition to independence supervised by more than 4000 
un monitors 
both the united nations and southwest africa peoples 
organization accuse exkoevoet members of continuing to harass 
civilians since their january integration into the regular police 
force 
their activities appear to have createad an atmosphere of fear 
and intimidation among much of the population in the northern 
region martti ahtisaari the un special representative to 
namibia said in a june 9 letter to pienaar 
in my opinion they are unfit for continued service in the 
police during the transition period in view of the need to ensure 
the necessary conditions for free and fair elecations the letter 
said 
pienaar said he has reports guerrillas are storing arms caches in 
northern namibia and he cannot afford to reduce the police strength 
we feel obliged to maintain a state of alertness commensurate 
with a potential threat to the security of the region he said 
i reject the possibility that men should be removed from the 
police just because they have been members of the counterinsurgency 
unit 
he emphasized he would dismiss individuals found guilty of 
misconduct 
ahtisaari and pienaar met wednesday to discuss the intimidation 
charges and plan more talks officials said 
in other developments un officials said 5621 namibian exiles 
have been flown home since they began a repatriation campaign 10 
days ago the un has registered more than 41000 namibian refugees 
at camps in neighboring angola zambia and botswana and wants to 
bring back 1000 a day for six weeks 
south africa agreed to grant namibia independence in exchange for 
the withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops helping angolas government 
fight usbacked rebels

rebel leader jonas savimbi said 
wednesday an african summit aimed at resolving the angolan civil war 
will fail unless direct talks begin between the rebels and the 
government 
but he told a news conference at his bush camp that never in 14 
years of war have we come so close to peace 
angolas official news agency announced wednesday the government 
released 700 rebel prisoners the dispatch said the prisoners were 
released june 2 and reported the prisoners had renounced the rebel 
movement and accepted the governments offer of clemency 
the announcement came on the eve of a meeting of african leaders 
in gbadolite zaire the meeting could clear the way for direct 
peace talks between angolas marxist government and the rebel 
national union for the total independence of angola 
savimbi said his delegation in zaire was willing to be flexible 
about procedures leading to elections and formation of a national 
unity government 
but he said the rebels would reject any amnesty or clemency for 
the guerrillas 
our army 75000 men in the field will not accept amnesty 
clemency or integration into the ruling popular movement for the 
liberation of angola savimbi said that wording has a political 
context that means the rebel army is considered criminal our army 
was not defeated and is not going to be defeated 
savimbi said he has agreed to stay out of the negotiations and 
will not demand a role in any transitional government but he said 
he would remain the head of his party he also wants to participate 
in free elections he anticipates within two years of a formal 
ceasefire 
he dismissed reports he might go into exile saying he would 
remain in angola after a ceasefire but not necessarily in his 
southeastern stronghold of jamba 
angolas government has rejected elections insisting on 
maintaining oneparty rule and offering some rebels positions in the 
administration 
the angolan news service angop said wednesday that president jose 
eduardo dos santos has a peace plan calling for savimbi to go 
abroad recognize the legitimacy of the government and for the rebel 
movement to be integrated into the oneparty state savimbi 
vehemently vetoed all these proposals at his news conference 
savimbi said the angolan government was under pressure because 
within six months half of the 50000 cuban soldiers who have 
supported it will have left angola under a usmediated southern 
african peace agreement reached in december 
the cubans have agreed to a gradual withdrawal to be completed 
by july 1991 but savimbi said the soviet union and the united 
states have promised to help the cubans leave quickly if the 
peace talks lead to formation of a transitional unity government 
before then 
the usbacked rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war to 
force the cuban and sovietassisted government to share power since 
shortly after angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
savimbi praised zairean president mobutu sese seko for organizing

the bush administration on wednesday raised the 
prospect that a childcare package being pushed by the senates 
democratic leadership would be vetoed and republicans sought support 
for an alternative the white house supports 
the specter of a veto was raised in an administration policy 
statement distributed on capitol hill as the senate debated the 
issue for a fifth day at the white house however a spokesman said 
president bush still hoped to reach agreement with congress on a 
plan 
in the threepage policy statement the administration said the 
childcare package being advocated by democratic leaders with the 
help of one leading gop senator orrin hatch of utah is 
fundamentally flawed and that if it reached the white house bushs 
senior advisers would recommend that he veto it 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater was less direct when asked 
whether bush would veto the legislation if it clears congress as it 
stands now 
fitzwater said the administration believed its tax credit 
proposal was the best approach to helping lowincome parents pay for 
child care but was willing to talk about alternatives and how this 
could be approved 
the legislation before the senate is a revised version of the act 
for better child care sponsored by hatch and sen christopher dodd 
dconn it authorizes 175 billion to be spent on child care in 
fiscal 1990 through subsidies to parents and states to help pay for 
child care and expand its availability 
states would be required to give 70 percent of the money directly 
to lowincome families for child care expenses with the rest used 
to fund and administer state programs designed to improve the 
quality and quantity of child care 
tacked on to the measure is a package of tax credits designed to 
help parents offset the costs of child care and health insurance 
those credits endorsed by the senate finance committee are similar 
to the credits at the heart of the alternative package being offered 
by senate republican leader bob dole of kansas with the support of 
the white house 
but dole and other gop lawmakers have virtually ignored the 
taxcredit provisions of the revised doddhatch plan and focused 
their attacks on the subsidy provisions of the measure which they 
contend give too much control of the money to state governments and 
not enough to parents 
the alternative republican plan includes an expansion of the 
existing earnedincome tax credit for parents with children under 
age 5 and a proposal to provide money up front to lowincome 
families who cannot take advantage of the dependentcare credit 
because their incomes are so low they do not pay taxes 
the senate is scheduled to vote thursday on whether to kill the 
democratic leadership plan in favor of the gop approach 
republicans have been lobbying southern democrats in hope of 
winning enough support for their package but the democratic 
leadership says it has the votes to quash the gop effort

interrogated for about an hour and then released they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
no official statement was made about the incident at myeinigon 
four miles north of downtown rangoon 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said the incident would be a grave blow to hopes that next years 
election will be free and fair 
boucher said the administration has noted with concern the 
burmese governments restrictions on political activity including a 
ban on gatherings of five or more people prohibition of opposition 
publications and harassment and arrest of opposition party leaders

office of her national league for democracy and then walked to the 
spot where several demonstrators were shot by police last june 21 
several hundred people were present at the wreathlaying when 
authorities moved in 
witnesses said aung san suu kyi and the others were taken away in 
open military trucks to a government office near where the ceremony 
took place 
in recent months aung san suu kyi has been harassed on occasion 
but generally been given considerable leeway by the military 
government to campaign throughout the country 
she returned to rangoon from london her home for many years to 
look after her ailing mother in april 1988 and became embroiled in 
political turmoil sweeping burma at the time 
she became one of the main leaders of a prodemocracy uprising 
that seemed on the verge of toppling 26 years of authoritarian rule 
through massive street demonstrations 
but in september gen saw maung and a group of military officers 
brutally crushed the studentled protests and clamped martial law on 
the country 
the new leaders allowed the formation of opposition political 
parties and have promised free general elections next year 
aung san suu kyi joined with two popular leaders retired brig 
gen aung gyi and former defense minister tin oo to form the 
national league for democracy aung gyi later left the group 
claiming the league was being infiltrated by communists

britons walked cycled hitchhiked shared cars or 
simply stayed home wednesday as a oneday strike idled the national 
railroads and londons buses and subways 
it was believed to be the first triplebarreled transport action 
since the 1926 general strike according to british rail and london 
underground 
careful planning and bright skies made it less nightmarish than 
commuters expected however 
london hotels were full of employees spending the night in the 
city to beat the strike many companies hired fleets of buses and 
thames river passenger ferries reported business was booming 
some judges at the old bailey central criminal court spent the 
night in their offices and hundreds of judges lawyers and jurors 
walked or cycled enabling 17 of the 19 courtrooms to function 
normally an early shortage of stenographers forced some judges to 
take their own notes as hearings got under way 
senior prosecutor john bevan cycled for several miles through 
slowmoving traffic carrying his gown in a bag on his back and he 
said he wouldnt like to repeat the experience 
my nerves are shattered he said it really is a most 
dangerous occupation 
i saw a car with three bikes on the roof two in the back and 
five people in the car i guess they just drive as far as they can 
and get on their bikes said patrick gilligan of london bicycle co 
forewarned by police to drive only if necessary motorists set 
out two or three hours early traffic was in fact quieter than 
normal on most of the motorway routes around london said the 
automobile association 
manchester liverpool edinburgh and glasgow also reported 
earlier rush hours with traffic little worse than normal 
it looks as if motorists have been sensible going in earlier 
and carsharing said the aa in glasgow 
london parking garages were packed and police refused to ease 
parking restrictions saying it would encourage more people to drive 
into the capital however free parking was set aside for buses 
bringing in commuters 
evangelist billy graham also laid on extra free parking at 
crystal palace in south london where he was preaching wednesday 
night 
overcoming traditional english reserve many suburbanites shared 
cars or were seen hitchhiking to work 
travelers using londons heathrow and gatwick airports were urged 
to use buses rather than taxis gatwicks express train to central 
london was idled as was the subway line to heathrow 
on strike were 75000 rail workers 18500 operators of londons 
red doubledecker buses and 10500 subway workers leaving only some 
private suburban bus routes operating in london 
it was the seventh subway strike in london in 11 weeks but only 
the first by rail workers since 1982 londons buses and subway 
system carry more than 3 million passengers a day and british rails 
national network carries 2 million daily 
the rail unions are rejecting stateowned british rails offer of 
a 7 percent wage increase and their tempers have been inflamed by 
the employers unsuccessful attempts to block the strike in the 
courts 
the national union of railwaymen says it scrupulously followed 
prime minister margaret thatchers unioncurbing laws which require 
unions to poll their members secretly and obtain a 55 percent 
majority for a walkout 
the bus workers have rejected an increase of 8 percent or 9 
percent and want 14 percent the subway workers want a 99 weekly 
increase to operate without a guard management is offering 46 plus 
14 days extra annual vacation but is tying the raise to increased 
productivity 
mrs thatcher displaying her deep dislike for the unions that 
dominated british life until her conservative party took office in 
1979 on tuesday denounced the railway workers as typically 
selfish deliberately causing massive inconvenience to those who 
have to work 
the transport strikes coupled with a surge in inflation to 83 
percent and interest rates at 14 percent have taken some of the 
shine off britains economic recovery under mrs thatcher and are 
seen as one of the reasons for the rout of the tories in last weeks 
elections to the european parliament

joseph a bevilacqua whose lifelong 
friendships with reputed mobsters tarnished and eventually ended his 
career as rhode islands top legislator and top judge died 
wednesday he was 70 
bevilacqua died at brigham and womens hospital in boston no 
further information was immediately available said hospital 
spokeswoman brenda buratti 
he had been hospitalized several times during the last few months 
in providence most recently in early may for a heart attack he was 
taken to brigham and womens on may 30 when he complained of 
problems with his medication relatives said 
bevilacqua was elected to the rhode island house in 1954 and 
maintained a successful criminal law practice while he rose through 
the ranks to become majority leader in 1966 and speaker in 1969 
questions about his ties to criminals came into the open when the 
general assembly elected him chief justice of the state supreme 
court in 1976 
among them were allegations that bevilacqua had harbored a 
fugitive from a 1963 department store robbery and accepted 2000 of 
the loot from him the fugitive robert northrop later recanted his 
story 
thenattorney general julius michaelson investigated the matter 
in 1977 but concluded there was no prosecutable case 
at about the same time a letter surfaced in which bevilacqua 
told the state parole board in 1973 that raymond ls patriarca the 
late new england organizedcrime boss was a person of integrity 
and in my opinion good moral character 
the commission on judicial tenure and discipline took no action 
after it investigated the letter and bevilacquas officiating at the 
the wedding of patriarcas chauffeur six months after becoming chief 
justice the chauffeur joseph a badway was under indictment for 
fraud at the time 
the series of events that finally brought bevilacqua down began 
at the end of 1984 with a providence journalbulletin story 
alleging that state police and the newspapers reporters had 
observed bevilacqua repeatedly visiting the homes of underworld 
figures 
the state police subsequently alleged that bevilacqua had also 
visited a smithfield motel owned by men linked to gambling and 
drugs for trysts with his secretary and another woman to whom he 
was not married 
the judicial commission launched a new investigation hiring 
former us supreme court justice arthur j goldberg as special 
counsel and censured bevilacqua for associating with criminals 
bevilacqua agreed to take an unpaid fourmonth leave of absence in 
1985 
when the general assembly convened the next year it launched 
impeachment proceedings two weeks after the house judiciary 
committee began public hearings on the matter bevilacqua resigned 
in february 1987 us attorney lincoln c almond confirmed that 
bevilacquas personal finances were under investigation 
at the time bevilacqua stepped down the impeachment hearings had 
begun to focus on his personal finances which he handled in cash 
and through third parties 
he is survived by his wife two sons and daughter 
funeral plans were incomplete

edwards is a mass murderer who killed in cold blood mabus said 
he tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the courts and 
discrimination had no bearing in his case

execution on procedural grounds 
dixon who also was black was killed during a fiveday robbery 
spree by edwards and codefendant mike white that left three people

the nations mayors called for higher 
federal taxes and tougher gun laws wednesday but their 
nearunanimity on issues was shattered by a partisan leadership 
battle 
bostons democratic mayor ray flynn a vocal critic of the bush 
administration was elected to a top post of the us conference of 
mayors after the groups only floor fight of their fiveday meeting 
it came at the end of a conference where partisanship flared into 
the open in contrast to recent previous gatherings where mayors did 
their best to blur party distinctions 
flynns contest against republican mayor william althaus of york 
pa was unprecedented in the groups 57year history which usually 
decides on its leadership in private 
flynns election was for the unglamorous title of chairman of the 
conferences advisory committee but it is coveted because it is 
third on the groups leadership ladder and means flynn will become 
conference president and leading spokesman for the nations mayors 
in 1991 if he remains mayor of boston 
the vote for flynn was decided largely along party lines 6735 
but the groups incoming president democratic mayor kathryn 
whitmire of houston voted for the republican whitmire has spoken 
with optimism and conciliation toward the bush administration like 
bush she is from texas and she faces a tough reelection race this 
year 
flynn said at issue in the dispute was whether mayors were 
willing to be aggressive in criticizing bush administration urban 
policies 
i dont think this is the time for mayors to sit back and just 
go along to say everythings all right in our cities flynn said 
everything is not all right in our cities the federal 
government has walked away from our cities 
flynn said he would decide next year whether to run for governor 
of massachusetts 
among the more than 50 policy statements approved by the full 
conference was one calling on the administration and congress to 
raise federal taxes to reduce the deficit and to finance greater 
spending on urban problems 
the mayors approved a resolution calling for an outright ban on 
possession as well as manufacture and sale of militarytype 
semiautomatic assault weapons that goes far beyond bushs ban on 
the importation of foreignmade assault weapons and would if law 
render illegal thousands of such weapons now owned by americans 
the mayors policy statements become the new policies that will 
guide the conferences lobbying efforts in congress 
the only real policy debate came on a resolution saying the 
mayors deplore recent supreme court decisions which they say 
weaken affirmative action programs making it more difficult to 
ensure equal opportunities in employment for all americans 
the mayors overwhelmingly voted down an effort by some florida 
mayors to soften the language of their resolution on 
antidiscrimination in employment mayor cecil bradbury of pinellas 
park fla argued that whites have been victims of reverse 
discrimination 
other resolutions called for tougher action against drugs 
poverty homelessness and aids but in an earlier committee mayors 
deleted a proposal offered by flynn to encourage free distribution 
of needles to drug adicts to reduce the spread of aids

the supreme court gave the news media added 
protection wednesday ruling that a florida newspaper doesnt have 
to pay 97500 to a rape victim whose name it published 
the court by a 63 vote limited states power to punish the 
reporting of truthful information that is lawfully obtained the 
three dissenting justices criticized the court in a strongly worded 
opinion for hampering efforts to protect the privacy of sexcrime 
victims 
florida law makes it a crime to print publish or broadcast 
the names of victims of sexual crime 
the florida star a weekly newspaper in jacksonville published a 
rape victims name in its oct 29 1983 police report 
the name had been obtained from a report posted apparently by 
mistake in the press room of the duval county sheriffs department 
most news organizations including the florida star have 
policies against publication of rape victims names the name of the 
woman identified in court records as bjf was published 
inadvertently the newpapers lawyers said 
relying on the state law the rape victim sued and won the 
97500 award which threatened to put the 18000circulation paper 
out of business her suit also named the sheriffs department as a 
defendant but she was paid 2500 in a pretrial settlement 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said the award 
violated freepress rights protected by the constitutions first 
amendment 
however the ruling did not preclude the possibility that states 
may punish those who publish the name of a sexcrime victim 
we do not hold that truthful publication is automatically 
constitutionally protected or that there is no zone of privacy 
within which the state may protect the individual from intrusion by 
the press marshall wrote 
we hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful 
information which it has lawfully obtained punishment may lawfully 
be imposed if at all only when narrowly tailored to a state 
interest of the highest order 
that interest was not present in the florida case marshall said 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor and byron r white dissented 
i would find a place to draw the line higher on the hillside a 
spot high enough to protect bjfs desire for privacy and peace of 
mind in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy said white 
writing for the three 
there is no public interest in publishing the names addresses 
and phone numbers of persons who are the victims of crime and no 
public interest in immunizing the press from liability in the rare 
cases where a states efforts to protect a victims privacy have 
failed he said 
white noted that the womans name was published a week after the 
assault before her assailant had been arrested 
as a result bjf received harassing phone calls required 
mental health counseling was forced to move from her home and was 
even threatened with being raped again he said 
eric o simpson publisher of the florida star said he was 
pleased with wednesdays decision 
we were being denied to publish the truth simpson said it 
constituted prior restraint 
simpson said that if the award had been upheld it might have led 
to laws restricting the reporting of names of victims of other types 
of crimes 
a person being raped is no worse than a person being killed 
he said 
marshalls opinion noted past high court decisions on the 
conflict between truthful reporting and stateprotected privacy 
interests 
the court in 1975 barred states from imposing sanctions for the 
publication of truthful information a rape victims name 
contained in official court records open to public inspection 
a 1977 decision struck down a state law that barred the news 
media from publishing the name or photograph of an 11yearold boy 
in connection with a juvenile court proceeding reporters had 
attended 
and in 1979 the court invalidated a state law that made it a 
crime for newspapers to publish without written approval of a 
juvenile court the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender 
even if that information were obtained lawfully 
marshalls opinion was joined by justices william j brennan 
harry a blackmun john paul stevens and anthony m kennedy justice 
antonin scalia concurred in the result

western nations on wednesday condemned chinas execution of three 
men involved in prodemocracy unrest and some said they may impose 
punitive sanctions on beijing 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain said she was 
utterly appalled by the executions the punishment is totally 
out of proportion to the crime she said 
the men were convicted of setting fire to a train on june 6 in 
shanghai after it ran through a barricade set up by protesters 
killing six people that protest came three days after chinese 
soldiers cleared central beijing of prodemocracy demonstrators and 
supporters 
eight other protesters previously had been sentenced to death in 
beijing and up to 17 more were condemned to death wednesday 
mrs thatcher said she and prime minister bob hawke of australia 
were discussing possible sanctions against china she would not 
elaborate 
britain already has canceled all ministerial visits and like 
australia protested the chinese crackdown on the studentled 
movement 
president bush said tuesday he would try to block 14 billion in 
development loans to china he also canceled all highlevel 
contacts including a july trip to china by commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher 
chinese students in the united states held a news conference in 
washington on wednesday to urge the administration to step up 
economic pressure on beijing 
the only language the chinese government can listen to is 
economic sanctions said ding xueliang 36 a sociologist and 
graduate student at harvard university 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said the united states 
deeply regretted the executions but planned no further sanctions 
there is an important relationship which we should seek to 
preserve if we possibly can he said 
french foreign minister roland dumas denounced the executions in 
a speech before the national assembly in paris 
what is happening in china is atrocious dumas said the 
totalitarian machine in all its horror is rolling it turns what 
should be judicial decisions into veritable murders 
he added in the name of the president i reiterate here 
frances appeal to the chinese authorities to show clemency and 
renounce executions and repression 
the west german government was deeply upset and renewed its 
appeal for clemency for the others sentenced to death said hans 
klein chancelor helmut kohls spokesman 
he said the executions represented a dangerous return to the 
times of humandegrading totalitarianism in the years before 1978 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar was very 
saddened by the executions and has appealed for clemency for 
others according to his spokeswoman nadia younes 
the dutch government said it was seized by disgust 
this new sad fact can only lead to a further cooling of 
relations the foreign ministry said 
a ministry spokesman said the executions were expected to be 
discussed at next weeks european economic community summit meeting 
in madrid spain 
the belgian government said it had learned with a great shock 
of the executions a foreign ministry spokesman said the government 
deplored that china had ignored the numerous appeals for clemency 
prime minister brian mulroney of canada said i think its a 
most deplorable situation a most regrettable turn of events 
the world apeared powerless to persuade china to change its 
tactics in crushing the prodemocracy movement mulroney said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater agreed 
the weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of 
china and it does not appear to have made much difference he 
said history has shown that they generally are not that 
responsive to outside kinds of pleas

the nation soon may face a shortage of 
electricity a senior energy department official said wednesday in 
comments reflecting a bush administration campaign to convince the 
public of a need for more nuclear power plants 
the demand for electricity in the united states is growing 
beyond our ability to provide additional generating capacity said 
john c tuck the undersecretary of energy 
he noted that electricity accounts for 37 percent of total us 
energy use 
tuck said it was inescapable that many more power plants will 
be needed if the economy is to continue to grow at a reasonable 
rate adding that utilities have balked at such construction because 
of the high cost and lack of public support no new nuclear plants 
have been ordered in the united states since 1978 
considering all these factors it is apparent that the nation 
may have an electricity shortage on its hands in the nottoodistant 
future tuck said in remarks to an industrysponsored symposium on 
nuclear reactors and us energy security 
tuck cited the case of long islands shoreham nuclear power 
station which new york state is planning to dismantle even though 
it recently gained a license to operate the energy department is 
trying to block the move arguing that shoreham is needed as a 
regional energy source and a national symbol of nuclear powers 
future 
tuck said the energy department is eager to complete research and 
development on several new types of nuclear reactors designed to be 
safer and more reliable than the lightwater reactors that have been 
used in this country since the 1950s 
we at the energy department believe that nuclear energy led by 
a new generation of advanced reactors will have a role in averting 
a possible electricity shortage he said 
tuck said a greater reliance on nuclear power also would help 
limit the nations dependence on foreign oil although this is 
disputed by many private analysts they note that while nuclear 
powers only nonmilitary role is to generate electricity oilfired 
plant produce only about 5 percent of the nations electricity 
about twothirds of the oil is used in cars and other vehicles 
nuclear power plants generate about 20 percent of the electricity 
supply

norwegians involved in the rescue of hundreds 
of passengers from a soviet liner said on wednesday that it was 
going too fast for safety when it rammed into an iceberg and took on 
water in arctic seas 
the head of the medical team aboard a norwegian rescue ship said 
some of the soviet crew were drunk at the time others involved in 
the rescue contradicted him 
ships and helicopters took the 575 passengers all but a dozen 
west germans to shelter on spitzbergen island they were flown 
wednesday to dusseldorf west germany cutting short their pleasure 
cruise to the land of the midnight sun 
about half the 378 soviet crewmen stayed on board to nurse the 
maxim gorky to harbor 
the disabled 25000ton vessel was limping under its own power in 
the norwegian sea toward spitzbergen about 180 miles east of the 
accident norwegian defense officials said 
dr mads gilbert aboard the coast guard cutter senja when it 
broke through thick ice to rescue the people said our impression 
was that some of the crew were intoxicated 
we were suprised at the extent of intoxication gilbert told 
state radio he said many crew members were too drunk to help 
operate pumps 12 hours after the accident 
rescued passengers some of whom spent seven hours in lifeboats 
at nearfreezing temperatures said they had been offered whiskey 
and vodka during the ordeal to ward off the cold 
the german passengers had nothing but praise for the soviet 
crew and said nothing about drunken crewmen said spitzbergen gov 
leif eldring who met arriving passengers early wednesday 
if the crew had been drunk the maxim gorky would have sunk 
said a soviet embassy official in oslo speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
maritime experts said the ship was moving at 21 mph when it 
struck the ice much faster than it should have sailed in 
treacherous waters 
i would hardly have sailed faster than two to three knots in 
such iceclogged water said sigurd kleiven captain of the senja 
guttorm jacobsen a skipper who has sailed the arctic for 40 
years told the verdens gang newspaper agreed saying the maxim 
gorky must have been too eager to keep its schedule 
the collision tore a gash 20 feet long and four to six inches 
wide in the bow the ship took on 18000 tons of water and was 
listing badly when the passengers scrambled into lifeboats 
for west german passenger giesela rillinger it was six hours 
of nothing but ice floes and the sky if a storm had come up it 
would have been all over for us six hours of facing death 
passenger maria sontheimer 71 also interviewed in dusseldorf 
said most people were seasick and the waves bounced us against 
each other 
some left the rafts and climbed onto ice floes for fear of being 
crushed between drifting blocks of ice 
we stood on the ice and all around us it cracked and crashed 
together one had that feeling that if you turned around those 
standing behind you would disappear said lutheran minister horst 
drosihn 
the nrk report said a lifeboat with 50 elderly passengers got 
stuck as it was being lowered into the water and dangled for four 
hours halfway down maxim gorkys side 
the soviet news agency tass said sailors plugged the holes in the 
bow it would receive emergency repairs on spitzbergen tass said

the american medical association for the first 
time in its history endorsed wednesday the concept of federally 
mandated employerprovided health insurance 
under a proposal passed by delegates at the amas annual 
policymaking convention the nations largest organization of 
doctors agreed to press for legislation calling for a phasedin 
requirement that employers limited initially to larger employers 
provide healthinsurance coverage within the private sector for all 
fulltime employees with coverage expanding over several years 
in addition the delegates recommended a program of diminishing 
tax credits or other incentives to avoid adverse effects on 
employers 
the policy adopted by the 433 members of the house of delegates 
calls for the ama to work with business groups to develop the 
approaches that are best suited to the needs of small employers 
such legislation would help the nations 37 million uninsured and 
also would allow doctors to recover fees lost under the medicaid 
program an ama spokesman said 
small businesses have lobbied heavily against proposals calling 
for any type of federally mandated employerprovided insurance and 
an industry spokeswoman said they would do the same with measures 
like that endorsed by the ama 
marcia bradford spokeswoman for national small business united 
a washington dc lobbying organization representing about 50000 
small businesses said that while the amas desire to include small 
businesses in developing national legislation is a step in the right 
direction theres still a fundamental question of government 
mandates that were opposed to 
the amas action is part of the organizations effort to combat 
moves to nationalize the us health care system a group of 
physicians started such an effort this year seeking adoption of a 
system similar to canadas in which individuals and employers are 
taxed to pay for health coverage for all 
the amas board of trustees strongly opposes the canadian system 
in which all responsibility for health care payment is placed on 
the government 
the ama also opposes a move led by sen edward kennedy dmass 
to force employers to provide a specific package of healthinsurance 
benefits for employees said dr wayne bradley the amas assistant 
executive vice president 
that plan with no gradual phasein might cause an employer 
not to hire an extra person or it might cause a business to go 
broke bradley said 
the ama favors less drastic reforms and advocates the principle 
that employees be covered by health insurance in the workplace he 
said its a major national problem 
bradley said it was the first time the ama had endorsed the 
concept of federally mandated employerprovided health insurance 
in other action wednesday the delegates elected the first female 
phsyician to the amas board of trustees its governing body 
nancy dickey of richmond texas thanked the delegates for the 
history you have just made women have been appointed in the 
past by other board members to student and resident trustee 
positions but dickey is the first to be elected a regular trustee 
by the full delegation 
dr alan nelson a salt lake city internist and presidentelect 
for the past year was named president of the ama nelson takes over 
the oneyear post from dr james davis a durham nc surgeon dr 
c john tupper an internist from davis calif was elected

israeli politicians said in a stormy parliament 
debate wednesday that vigilante action by jewish settlers could push 
the country to the brink of civil war 
legislators were divided about how to curb governmentarmed 
jewish settlers living in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
arab assailants in the west bank town of nablus shot and killed 
47yearold taxi driver hassan sharoub on wednesday he was 
suspected of cooperating with israeli authorities israeli radio 
reports and arab journalists said the army said it was 
investigating 
in the gaza strip 12 palestinians were wounded in confrontations 
with israeli troops wednesday arab reports said the army confirmed 
one of the wounded in gaza and said three other palestinians were 
wounded in clashes in the west bank 
sharoubs death brings to 527 the toll of palestinians killed in 
their 18month rebellion against israeli occupation among the dead 
are 64 suspected collaborators twentythree israelis also have died 
israeli leaders raised the specter of civil warfare after jewish 
settlers angered at the weekend killing of a usborn settler 
went on rampages after his funeral tuesday 
three palestinian shepherds have been detained for the killing of 
frederick steven rosenfeld 48 who was stabbed saturday as he hiked 
around arab villages near his west bank settlement of ariel 
settlers at rosenfelds funeral shouted down prime minister 
yitzhak shamir calling him a traitor and accusing him of failing to 
protect jews living in the territories 
after the funeral one settler pumped submachine gunfire at arabs 
waiting for rides near tel aviv wounding two at least four other 
palestinians were injured when their cars were hit by stones thrown 
by jewish protesters 
earlier fistfights erupted at the burial service when settlers 
attacked a leftwing activist and then struck soldiers who rescued 
the man 
israeli officials say they fear the settlers increasingly could 
direct their violence at israeli soldiers or jewish political rivals 
shamir on wednesday urged israelis not to battle among themselves 
we must do everything to make sure such a war never happens 
shamir said on israel radio this is the most dangerous thing 
i would suggest to everyone to lower the profile of our 
internal debates he said 
the debate in the knesset israels parliament left legislators 
divided over whether the army should take harsher action to crush 
the palestinian revolt or to restrict settlers 
yossi sarid of the leftleaning citizens rights movement said if 
only a small number of settlers are violent as the government 
suggests they should be jailed 
but rafael eitan a former army chief of staff from the 
rightwing tsomet party said it was the governments failure to 
curb arab violence that prompted settlers actions 
in a situation where the government is not capable of 
maintaining the security of its citizens hotheads are always liable 
to stand up and take the law into their own hands he said 
legislators joined in condemning the violence 
eitan said the incidents must shock us all into seeing what can 
happen in the future 
sarid said all is ready for a civil war there are enough 
weapons to prove people are ready to kill innocent civilians

a black priest who plans to start a separate 
africanamerican catholic congregation said wednesday he is not 
defying roman catholic tenets despite warnings from church leaders 
while the establishment of this congregation does not enjoy the 
endorsement or authority of his eminence james cardinal hickey we 
see ourselves as being obedient to the law of god and following the 
dictates of our consciences said the rev george a stallings jr 
stallings 41 said he plans to create the imani temple 
africanamerican catholic congregation in washington because the 
roman catholic church has failed to meet the spiritual and cultural 
demands of its black parishioners 
however the priest said his move is not intended to be a 
departure from catholicism 
he said his church would adopt a zairian liturgy and would 
combine readings from the works of noted black writers and 
philosophers such as martin luther king jr and malcolm x with 
traditional scripture passages 
imani means faith in swahili 
cardinal hickey of washington and a prominent black church leader 
both condemned stallings actions 
in spite of his claims to the contrary father stallings 
action is a serious step towards separating himself from the roman 
catholic church hickey said in a statement this situation has 
more to do with the needs and expectations of father stallings than 
with broader questions about the adequacy of catholic ministry 
within the black community 
bishop john ricard chairman of the committee for black catholics 
of the national conference of catholic bishops also expressed 
criticism in a statement issued by hickeys office 
although i acknowledge that we as africanamerican catholics 
still find it necessary to struggle for full inclusion in the 
catholic church the founding of the imani temple is a regressive 
step ricard said 
hickey also said that stallings former catholic parishioners 
should not support his efforts and that doing so would leave them in 
an ambiguous position with the roman catholic church 
stallings said of his own situation i cannot be excommunicated 
from my faith when i lay down i have to answer not to an 
institution but to the man that woke me up 
of the nations 300 bishops 13 are black while there are about 
1100 predominantly black parishes nationwide there are just 200 
black priests 
hickey noted that stallings made his announcement even though the 
bishops in their national conference committed themselves only 
last sunday to stronger efforts to support the black catholic 
community 
but stallings said those efforts fall short of black 
parishioners needs

chinas execution of three people wednesday for 
burning a train during a prodemocracy protest flouted worldwide 
calls for mercy in the governments crackdown on political dissent 
the death sentences announced on radio and television were 
carried out in shanghai where the arson incident occurred june 6 
the executions came a day after president bush appealed for 
clemency and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged 
that china had turned its back on the pleas 
the weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of 
china and it does not appear to have made much difference he 
said history has shown that they generally are not that 
responsive to outside kinds of pleas 
so far 28 people have been condemned to death the three who 
were executed the 17 who were sentenced on wednesday after a public 
trial in shandong province and eight others in beijing who were 
previously sentenced to death 
their crimes ranged from rumormongering to beating soldiers 
and burning vehicles 
the three executed were convicted of setting fire to a train 
after it smashed through a barricade set up by demonstrators 
killing six people the three then beat firefighters who tried to 
douse the blaze according to the shanghai peoples intermediate 
court 
bush on tuesday suspended highlevel uschinese contacts and 
moved to block 14 billion in development loans to protest the 
crackdown france and the netherlands already had frozen relations 
and japan has suspended new development loans 
the government depends heavily on foreign investment for capital 
and technology and has stressed during the past two weeks that 
things are back to normal in china 
china did not immediately respond to the us moves but the 
staterun xinhua news agency said wednesday the united states was 
interfering in chinas affairs and that there would be no mercy 
the 11 thugs have been sentenced to death according to chinas 
criminal law because they committed heinous crimes of beating 
smashing looting and burning xinhua before the additional 
sentences were announced 
other nations had joined the united states in urging clemency 
and some denounced china following the executions 
what is happening in china is atrocious foreign minister 
roland dumas of france told the national assembly in paris the 
totalitarian machine in all its horror is rolling 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain said in london that 
she and prime minister bob hawke of australia were discussing steps 
against the chinese government the punishment is totally out of 
proportion to the crime she said 
in the hague the dutch government said it was seized by 
disgust this new sad fact can only lead to a further cooling 
of relations said a statement issued by the foreign ministry 
china began its crackdown on the prodemocracy movement on june 3 
and has said the matter is a domestic affair 
premier li peng said monday the government would spare no effort 
in tracking down protest organizers 
the approach is not new in a 1987 speech senior leader deng 
xiaoping said that after widespread arrests of prodemocracy 
protesters 10 years ago china suffered no discredit and that 
on the contrary the prestige of the country is steadily growing 
fitzwater said the united states could not afford to turn its 
back on china even though it deplored the crackdown 
everyone has to recognize first of all that this is a country 
of a billion people a sizeable portion of the worlds population 
that cannot be closeted off and ignored he said 
china imposes the death penalty for certain violent and economic 
crimes but also for some political offenses and often for crimes 
involving foreigners 
in april a court in shanghai sentenced a man to death after he 
was convicted of robbing the us consulate in that city over a 
period of 14 months of about 8900 
the human rights group amnesty international said in 1985 that 
10000 people had been executed in china since a nationwide 
crackdown on crime two years earlier chinese officials do not 
release figures on executions

iran and the soviet union ended nearly a decade of 
icy relations wednesday when irans parliament speaker invited 
mikhail s gorbachev to visit iran and the two leaders agreed on 
wide economic cooperation 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani told the soviet president that 
iranians hold him in high esteem and look forward to meeting him 
the official tass news agency reported 
it said gorbachev thanked rafsanjani for the invitation and said 
frequent highlevel contacts are appropraite as relations warm no 
date was set 
only a handful of third world leaders have visited tehran since 
the 1979 islamic revolution transformed the iranian capital into a 
city known for mobs of religious fanatics shouting death to 
america death to russia 
rafsanjani and gorbachev have been meeting in the kremlin over 
two days with a number of their colleagues tass said they will sign 
several agreements before rafsanjani leaves moscow 
among them are a promise to be good neighbors on their 1550mile 
border and an agreement on joint projects in 15 areas of the 
economy including nuclear energy gas processing and space 
the level of relations which may extend to putting an iranian on 
board a soviet spaceship marks a dramatic turnaround earlier this 
decade the soviet union was supplying weapons for iraq to fight 
iran and ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis fundamentalist regime was 
banning irans communist party 
in contrast tass quoted rafsanjani as saying wednesday i have 
been in moscow less than 24 hours yet already i feel almost at 
home 
tehran television said rafsanjani is extending his visit beyond 
the planned thursday departure 
it was rafsanjani who suggested a joint sovietiranian space 
voyage and gorbachev ordered his deputies to begin planning details 
rafsanjani emphasized that it was khomeini himself who in 
february several months before his death on june 3 called for 
better relations with the soviet union tass noted that gorbachev 
and khomeini exchanged messages in february and since then their 
foreign ministers have met four times 
we should admit that in the past we had periods where our 
border turned into a blank wall gorbachev said at a kremlin 
banquet for rafsanjani it is good that those times apparently 
have passed 
moscow had hoped the revolution that ousted the late shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi a longtime us ally would give it a toehold 
in the nation on its southern border instead iranian 
fundamentalists chose an independent path and held moscow in disdain 
now tass said rail links will be restored and another rail line 
constructed 
with ties to the west strained tehran is looking to the soviet 
bloc for help in rebuilding iran after its eightyear war with iraq 
which halted with a ceasefire in august 
iranian officials said last month they hoped to sign an arms deal 
with moscow but tass said nothing on the subject

the civil aviation authority wednesday lifted its 
grounding order on 12 boeing 737400 planes operated by british 
airlines provided modifications are made to the engines 
the planes were grounded nine days ago after two incidents in 
which 737400s were forced to make emergency landings because fan 
blades broke in their cfm 563c engines 
the engines are manufactured by cfm international a joint 
venture between snecma of france and general electric of the united 
states 
britains aviation authority imposed power cuts of 1500 pounds 
of thrust on the cfm 563c engines effectively converting them to a 
previous generation of that make 
the planes will be allowed a maximum thrust of 22000 pounds the 
same as the previous cfm 563b which had 6 million hours of 
reliable service 
airlines were also ordered to replace the engines fan blades and 
discs regular visual inspections of fan blades and the front face 
of the engine discs will also be required a spokesman for the 
british authority said 
airlines were already making the modifications and some 737400s 
might be back in operation on thursday he said 
demonstrations wednesday by the engine manufacturer showed that 
fan fatigue occurred near the peak in the engines thrust the 
spokesman said 
it has now been found that running it at that higher speed 
particularly at the rate of climb has induced something that will 
need further investigation he said 
the grounding order was made after fan blades broke on a danair 
plane at gatwick airport on june 9 and on a british midland airways 
aircraft at heathrow airport on june 11 
fan blade problems were also thought to have contributed to the 
engine failure that led to the january crash of a british midland 
737400 near east midlands airport in leicestershire killing 47 
the us federal aviation adminstration rejected the british 
authoritys grounding request and cleared 737400s to fly with the 
lower engine thrust and new blades and discs 
in addition to british midland and danair 737400s are operated 
by novair air europe and air ukleisure

engineer found the body inside the wheel well in the right hand main 
undercarriage after the plane landed at londons gatwick airport

are in touch with the russian embassy hasegawa said 
sussex police said they believe the man was crushed when the 
undercarriage was raised after take off 
there are no suspicious circumstances and from documentation

a judge temporarily restored driving 
privileges wednesday to a married teenager whose license was 
suspended under a law aimed at curbing a high rate of school 
dropouts 
kanawha county circuit judge paul zakaib jr set aside michael 
means license suspension for 30 days to allow attorneys to file 
briefs in the case 
means 17 of charleston who dropped out of the ninth grade last 
year appealed a department of motor vehicles decision to suspend 
his license under a firstofitskind law aimed at reducing the 
states dropout rate now about 17 percent 
under education reform law passed by the legislature last summer 
students under 18 who miss more than 10 consecutive days of school 
or have 15 unexcused absences must give up their driving privileges 
means attorney christopher butch argued that the law was in 
conflict with another state law permitting students to drop out of 
school at age 16 the law he said was condemning means and his 
family to poverty because he was unable to earn the money he needed 
to support his family without a drivers license 
the law is not only draconian its unreasonable in this 
case butch told the court wednesday 
means 16yearold wife tonya who is expecting a child in 
august said the state was preventing her husband from caring for 
her and their unborn child her license also was suspended because 
she is a dropout 
we have the same responsibilities as anyone over 18 she 
said he has a house to pay for and has to earn money to care for 
me and the baby 
means said despite the judges decision he still felt the state 
was trying to force him to return to school 
i think theyre trying to pressure me to force me to enroll in 
a high school equivalency program i dont like being forced to do 
anything he said 
zakaib said means could retain his driving privileges permanently 
if he enrolls in an equivalency course and makes satisfactory 
progress 
deputy attorney general bruce wilson who represents the 
department of motor vehicles said he was satisfied with the 
progress of the case 
i was just worried that this would drag on through the courts 
until he turned 18 wilson said i think this allows for a 
quick resolution 
butch left the court room immediately after the judge stayed the 
suspension and was unavailable for comment 
wilson argued that revoking the decision to suspend means 
license would send the wrong message to teenagers in similar 
situations 
it will encourage those people who want to avoid their 
responsibility to the state and to themselves wilson said 
he argued that statistics show dropouts are less likely to be 
able to obtain jobs paying above the minimum wage 
maybe an education some training would help these people 
break this cycle a cycle of poverty and lowered ambitions 
therese wilson director of the office of support services for 
the state department of education testified that after the law went 
into effect 1800 dropouts returned to school in the fall and 50 
percent were still attending school in march 
the states recent dropout rate of around 17 percent is 
equivalent to 5000 students wilson said the state expected to 
reduce the rate this year by 1000 students as a direct result of 
the new law she said 
several states including wisconsin and texas where gov bill 
clements signed a dropout bill into law friday have passed similar 
legislation and others are considering such laws

the united states does not plan further 
sanctions to punish china for executing three people and hopes to 
preserve relations with beijing if we possibly can secretary of 
state james a baker iii said wednesday

executions which were carried out in shanghai over pleas for 
clemency by the united states and other western nations

one day after adopting new sanctions and asking china to spare 
the lives of demonstrators sentenced to death the united states 
muted its reaction to the executions state department spokesman 
richard boucher said there was no plan to register a protest or to 
call in a chinese diplomat 
president bush brushed aside reporters questions about the 
matter 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said sanctions and pleas 
for leniency have not swayed chinese leaders 
its hard to suggest that there has been very much impact 
fitzwater said 
the weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of 
china and it does not appear to have made much difference he said 
history has shown that they generally are not that responsive to 
outside kinds of pleas 
fitzwater joined baker in emphasizing that the united states must 
continue to do business with china despite international outrage 
over the countrys bloody crackdown and suppression of prodemocracy 
forces 
this is a country of a billion people and is a sizable portion 
of the world population that cannot be closeted off and ignored 
fitzwater said 
on capitol hill however senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said that in view of the executions and other barbaric 
acts the president must and should consider taking further steps 
particularly with respect to trade 
there are times when what american stands for and believes in 
is more important than an economic benefit to be derived from a 
trade relationship mitchell said 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate appropriations 
foreign operations subcommittee said he told chinese ambassador han 
xu that economic sanctions are certain to be imposed if executions 
continue 
much that has been built up in the last 10 years could be 
destroyed leahy said 
he said han replied that actions by his government are internal 
matters and that he hoped the administration would be careful in 
not taking steps that would sever a relationship carefully nurtured 
over a decade 
after prodding from congress the white house announced tuesday 
it was ending all highlevel official contacts with beijing and 
attempting to postpone new loans from international banks a step 
that could affect at least 14 billion for beijing 
the world bank chief source of aid to third world countries 
said it already had suspended new loans to china as of june 8 just 
days after chinese troops killed hundreds perhaps thousands of 
demonstrators in beijing 
shanghai authorities executed three men who were convicted of 
setting fire to a train after it crashed through a barricade erected 
by prodemocracy demonstrators and killed six people 
baker said the united states is not contemplating any 
additional action at this time against beijing 
there is an important relationship here which we should seek to 
preserve if we possibly can baker said that is a consideration 
that must be taken on board 
baker commented to reporters outside the white house as he 
escorted visiting west german foreign minister hans 
dietrichgenscher to a luncheon 
genscher had been asked his reaction during a picturetaking 
session with bush and began to reply that we are condemning the 
brutal his comment was cut off by a white house aide who 
shouted an order for the photo session to end 
later genscher told a news conference that he and bush 
discussed with great concern the developments in the peoples 
republic of china i said that we condemn the brutality that is 
expressed in the death sentences and their execution 
fitzwater discussing the us approach to chinas crackdown 
said its important that we have some perspective in viewing the 
overall longterm relationship with china and that we believe we 
have tried to strike the right balance 
we feel were walking a line there in a sense but we think 
theres been no question about how the us feels he said no 
one around the world can have any doubt about the us outrage at 
this entire process

congressional leaders wednesday urged president 
bush to consider curbing trade with china in an effort to end the 
executions of prodemocracy demonstrators 
the president must and should consider taking further steps 
particularly with respect to trade senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine told the senate calling the executions 
barbaric acts 
i say that in full awareness that we benefit from trade with 
china mitchell said but there are times when what america 
stands for and believes in is more important than an economic 
benefit to be derived from a trade relationship 
three men were executed in shanghai on wednesday and as many as 
17 other people have been sentenced to death for their roles in the 
studentled protests earlier this month 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the sentate appropriations 
foreign operations subcommittee said he told chinese ambassador han 
xu in an hourlong conversation wednesday that economic sanctions 
were certain if repression and executions continue 
much that has been built up in the last 10 years could be 
destroyed leahy said if the repression and executions continue 
much longer the break will be irreparable 
han leahy said replied with the official line stating that 
actions taken by his government are internal matters 
meanwhile sen william cohen rmaine introduced legislation to 
make it easier for chinese students and scholars in the united 
states to apply for asylum 
he said the purpose of the legislation was to provide a safe 
haven for students who fear persecution if they return and to signal 
the chinese government that its repressive campaign will mean the 
loss of thousands of its best and brightest students 
cohen said his bill would go beyond the step taken by president 
bush of authorizing a special immigration status permitting chinese 
students to remain through june 5 1990 
an alternative bill was introduced by sens herb kohl dwis 
and alan cranston dcalif to permit chinese students to renew 
their visas and apply for permanent residence in the united states 
there are more than 40000 chinese students attending american 
colleges and universities

a few major cable television operators are now 
the godfathers of the industry exacting tribute from startup 
companies and withholding programming from rural viewers a senate 
panel was told wednesday 
an increasingly prosperous cable industry has raised prices and 
stiffarmed microwave and home satellite dish companies that need 
programming while growing into a cable cosa nostra that can do 
as it pleases without fear of regulation or competition sen albert 
gore dtenn said 
since 1986 when a 1984 law deregulating cable was fully in 
place only about six new cable program networks have been 
successful and they all are at least partially owned by major cable 
system operators gore said at a senate communications subcommittee 
hearing on ownership of the cable tv industry 
in the wake of deregulation we have witnessed an extraordinary 
concentration of control and integration by cable operators and 
program services manifesting itself in blatantly anticompetitive 
behavior towards those who would compete with existing cable 
operators for the right to distribute services gore said 
in the case of satellite dish owners for example program 
services have consistently refused to deal with distributors unless 
they are cable operators shutting out almost all competition for a 
market that ironically cable itself has largely refused to 
serve added gore who has introduced legislation that would 
reregulate cable allow telephone companies to compete in cable and 
require cable operators to provide access for all program services 
and delivery technologies 
wednesdays was the second in a series of three hearings on media 
ownership that have featured a virtual whos who of television 
industry executives 
the hearings were spurred by increasing complaints to congress of 
price hikes and poor service and of quickbuck buying and 
selling of cable systems the horizontal concentration of a few 
companies has turned cable into a major tv force that enters more 
than half the nations living rooms 
at least a dozen bills are pending in congress to reregulate 
cable prices try to induce competition or to slow the shift of tv 
sports to pay television 
james mooney president of the national cable television 
association testified that there was great sensitivity in his 
industry to complaints but that cable has changed television for the 
better as it loosened the stranglehold of abc cbs and nbc and 
offered far more and better programming 
cable industry investment in new programming socalled vertical 
integration has spurred the cable boom and has not impeded the 
development of competing technologies or program services mooney 
said 
but preston padden president of the association of independent 
television stations said that when nbc launched its new consumer 
news and business channel earlier this year nbc reportedly paid the 
nations largest cable system operator telecommunications inc 
an estimated 20 million to buy or lease tempo television a 
cable service whose apparent assets would appear to have been 
negligible 
that transaction has all the appearances of the payment of 
tribute for access through tcis concentrated monopoly subscriber 
base padden said 
gore called it a shakedown by a godfatherlike cable 
cosa nostra in which any new programming source first must get 
approval from a halfdozen major cable operators before it can even 
think of proceeding 
gore subcommittee chairman sen daniel inouye dhawaii and 
sens larry pressler rsd and conrad burns rmont expressed 
concern that their largely rural constituencies were being 
shortchanged by the cable industrys apparent reluctance to sell 
programs to microwave cable and home satellite dish users

the environmental protection agency on 
wednesday declared that sodium sulfate which accounts for about 
half of the hazardous chemical releases by industry nationwide 
isnt a toxic substance at all 
sodium sulfate is a widely used agent and byproduct in a variety 
of processes including the production of paper glass and detergents 
the chemical industry had petitioned the epa to reclassify sodium 
sulfate arguing that there is no evidence the chemical poses a 
significant health threat 
the action by the epa had been expected the agency staff had 
earlier recommended that sodium sulfate be reclassified as being 
nontoxic due to an apparent absence of significant toxicity 
concerns about the chemical 
robert j israel epa petitions coordinator said the 
reclassification was taken after the agency concluded that sodium 
sulfate did not meet the health and environmental toxicity 
criteria required by the law 
the chemical is widely used in industry and accounted for nearly 
54 percent of all the toxic chemicals releases into the air water 
and soil during 1987 according to an epa report eaerlier this week 
on releases by industry of 328 toxic chemicals 
the agency said that more than 12 billion pounds of sodium 
sulfate were releases by industrial plants most of it into surface 
water during 1987 
the absence of sodium sulfate from the epa toxic chemical list 
will result in significant changes in the national profile on toxic 
releases agency officials said 
for example the largest volume of sodium sulfate releases 
occurred in california including 53 billion pounds from one plant 
causing that state to lead every other state in toxic industrial 
chemical releases for 1987 without sodium sulfate california would 
have ranked ninth the epa said 
overall 225 billion pounds of toxic releases were reported for 
1987 according to the epa report but that volume is more than cut 
in half without sodium sulfate 
water discharges were the most common form of toxic chemical 
releases in 1987 largedly because threefourths of all relases of 
sodium sulfate were into surface water without sodium sulfate 
water releases would have ranked last

william hurt referred to his lover as his wife 
when she was pregnant with their child according to a doctors wife 
who testified wednesday that she recognized the actors voice from 
the movie body heat 
shirley credle of beaufort sc wife of dr bernard credle an 
obstetrician said hurt called their house sometime after he arrived 
in the state in late october 1982 to film the big chill 
hurt was referring to dancer sandra jennings 32 who was then 
about eight months pregnant with hurts son alexander devon hurt 
now 6 
jennings claims a commonlaw marriage exists between her and hurt 
under south carolina statutes she says she now wants a divorce 
and up to half of everything he has earned in the past 6 years 
jennings lawyer a richard golub estimates hurts worth at 10 
million 
mrs credle said she did not recognize hurts voice until he 
identified himself but then she remembered his voice from the movie 
body heat 
is this mrs doctor mrs credle quoted hurt as asking she 
said she told him she was and hurt said can i speak to the doctor 
about my wife 
she said she never met hurt or jennings 
jennings claim is based on four weeks she spent with hurt in 
beaufort from dec 9 1982 to jan 10 1983 while he was filming 
the big chill 
hurt reportedly learned he was divorced from actress mary beth 
hurt on dec 9 1982 after seven years of marriage jennings argues 
that from that day on a commonlaw marriage has existed between her 
and hurt although there was never a formal ceremony 
new york where the two lived most of the time does not 
recognize commonlaw marriages 
golub said mrs credles testimony proved hurt and jennings were 
living as husband and wife in south carolina but since mrs credle 
could not say for certain that the call came after dec 9 1982 the 
value of her testimony is questionable 
state supreme court justice jacqueline silbermann who is hearing 
the trial without a jury must decide whether a commonlaw marriage 
exists the judge has indicated that jennings will have a hard time 
proving her case 
jennings was on the stand part of wednesdays court session for 
crossexamination and hurts lawyer martin shelton showed that 
her testimony was sometimes inconsistent with earlier sworn 
statements 
for example she once said hurt had her sign a prenuptial 
agreement on dec 3 1982 in which she forfeited any claims to his 
money she later testified she had learned they signed the agreement 
around christmas that year 
hurt testified no agreement was ever signed 
in a sworn affidavit jennings said hurt told her it would be 
unseemly for them to have a civil marriage ceremony with her being 
nine months pregnant and everybody thinking they were already 
married 
in court wednesday she testified that hurt had never said 
anything about a civil ceremony being unseemly the trial is 
scheduled to resume thursday

a justice department spokesman said wednesday 
that president bush is expected to nominate robert b fiske jr who 
has come under fire from some conservatives to be deputy attorney 
general 
consultation with senators opposed to fiske has delayed the 
formal nomination said david runkel chief spokesman for attorney 
general dick thornburgh runkel added that it is our expectation 
that mr fiske will be nominated and confirmed by the senate 
runkel said thornburgh spoke with a number of republican senators 
who signed a letter last week urging bush not to nominate fiske he 
declined to identify those speaking with thornburgh 
the letter was signed by 14 senators including sen strom 
thurmond rsc the ranking gop member of the senate judiciary 
committee 
it charged that fiske acted improperly when he chaired the 
american bar associations judicial screening panel by giving names 
of prospective nominees to liberal organizations which then used the 
information to mobilize opposition to the candidates 
the aba has said that the names were given to the organizations 
as part of an effort to determine if the candidates had a history of 
bias against women and minorities 
asked why bush has not sent fiskes name to the senate runkel 
said there have been questions raised by members of the senate 
concerning the abas role in the evaluating the professional 
qualificiations of judicial candidates 
some discussions have been going on regarding fiskes role at 
the aba runkel said 
the justice department has said that fiske a partner in a large 
new york law firm and who was once us attorney there would not be 
involved in picking judges for the federal bench 
despite the conservative opposition bush has indicated he 
planned to nominate fiske at a gathering of us attorneys friday 
at the white house bush said a number of key officeholders in his 
administration had been us attorneys 
we hope to see yet another bob fiske of new york joining 
our ranks here soon bush said without elaborating

hundreds of civil rights veterans and 
movement newcomers gathered outside a onceburned rural church 
wednesday to honor three young men who died 25 years ago in the 
struggle to register black voters 
we deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago said 
secretary of state dick molpus a philadelphia native we wish we 
could bring them back every decent person in philadelphia and 
neshoba county feels that way 
the event held on the grounds of the methodist church where 
james chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner had been the 
night they were killed by ku klux klansmen showed that 
mississippi and america are far different places than they were 25 
years ago gov ray mabus said 
more than 1000 people sat in folding chairs placed in the 
reddish dust on the church grounds with the hot june sun bearing 
down on the nearly threehour ceremony 
attending the ecumenical service at mount zion methodist church 
were relatives of the three slain men and 470 people from 
philadelphia pa and new york whose philadelphia to philadelphia 
project bus caravan arrived tuesday in nearby meridian 
this is a bittersweet moment for me said rita schwerner 
bender schwerners widow sad because it recalls personal pain 
but good because i have the opprtunity after all this time to 
say hello again to many people whose kindess and courage were beyond 
explaining 
the church has special significance for the civil rights struggle 
in mississippi because it is where chaney goodman and schwerner had 
gone to investigate a fire the day they were killed by ku klux 
klansmen 
the service was part of a daylong series of activities in rural 
eastern mississippi on wednesdays 25th anniversary of the murders 
a couple of hours before the service about 200 people crowded 
into tiny okatibbee baptist cemetery near meridian where chaney was 
buried 
schwerner and goodman were white civil rights volunteers from the 
new york city area chaney was a young black man from meridian 
they were murdered by white racists in neighboring neshoba 
county the slayings and attempted coverup by neshoba county 
officials outraged the nation 
it also was a dramatic and tragic beginning to the socalled 
mississippi freedom summer project which brought young people 
from the north pouring into the state 
an fbi investigation revealed goodman schwerner and chaney were 
killed by members of the klan their bodies were buried in an 
earthen dam near philadelphia 40 miles north of meridian 
molpus said state officials hoped to use the event to show the 
world there have been many positive changes in mississippi since the 
bloody summer of 1964 
we intend to send a message to the nation that the only thing 
burning in mississippi today is a desire for a better life for all 
our people molpus said in an oblique reference to the movie 
mississippi burning 
mississippi did not bring murder charges in the case however 19 
mississipians most from the meridian and philadelphia areas were 
prosecuted under federal statutes for violating the victims civil 
rights 
seven men eventually were convicted and an eighth pleaded guilty 
their prison sentences ranged from three to 10 years prison but the 
most any ever served was six years

president carlos andres perez on 
wednesday told delegations from 127 nations that the economic 
totalitarianism of the developed world is crushing an increasingly 
restive third world 
perez in a welcoming speech to the un group of 77 praised the 
us brady plan as an important initiative for relieving the burden 
of a 13 trillion debt on the third world 
but we impatiently wait for the concrete gains in light of 
our urgent situation said perez 
perezs efforts to impose austerity measures in his country 
backed by international creditors prompted riots in february that 
killed about 300 people 
similar riots were reported in may in argentina another large 
contributor to latin americas 401 billion foreign debt 
perez said 40 countries in the underdeveloped world with a 
combined population of more than 800 million faced severe 
financial problems because of the debt he said that since 1982 
those countries signed up to 90 restructuring agreements with banks 
but the banks never agreed to interest rates at or below market 
rates 
when we speak of that economic totalitarianism that is forced 
on us we refer to insensitive attempts to relegate our economic 
and social development to immediate needs of fiscal balance in order 
to assure the payment of the debt perez said 
the plan proposed by us treasury secretary nicholas brady on 
march 10 encourages banks to forgive a substantial portion of their 
loans to heavily indebted countries in return for guarantees that 
the rest will be paid the international monetary fund and the world 
bank would furnish the guarantees 
the brady plan also calls for economic reforms in debtor 
countries in order to receive the benefits of reductions in the debt 
perez said developed countries call for belttightening for the 
poor when they lived beyond their means at the expense of the rest 
of the world 
he castigated the industrialized nations for basing their growth 
on the destruction of the environment along with an immoral export 
of toxic wastes to the third world 
perez made calls to the group of 77 to renew the commitment to 
economic cooperation within the underdeveloped world saying such 
efforts had flagged under the strain of the debt crisis 
the group a nonaligned organization within the un system was 
formed 25 years ago to give underdeveloped nations a forum to push 
for changes in the international economy 
originally comprised of 77 member nations the group officially 
admitted mongolia as its 128th member wednesday 
the group meeting until friday is expected to call for a better 
economic conditions in the light of the increasing impoverishment of 
the underdeveloped world and increased economic cooperation between 
the underdeveloped nations said muchkund dubey permanent secretary 
of economic affairs of the indian foreign ministry

activists who fought a clash between patriotism 
and creativity stemming from an art students floor display of the 
us flag hailed wednesdays us supreme court decision clearing a 
flagburning protester 
some illinois lawmakers however said theyll fight on for a law 
to punish improper displays of the flag 
the high court voting 54 threw out the conviction of a 
protester sentenced to a year in jail and fined 2000 for burning 
the flag in texas 
the court said the flagburning at a demonstration in dallas 
during the 1984 republican national convention was a form of 
expression protected by the constitutions guarantee of freedom of 
speech 
one illinois activist said the ruling will discourage passage of 
illinois proposals to prohibit displaying the flag on the floor but 
a sponsor of such a proposal says the texas case may have little 
relevance to illinois legislation 
hopefully it the ruling will have some impact on the broader 
questions of censorship so prevalent today said rich hutchinson 
a member of the nomandatory patriotism organizing committee in 
chicago 
no doubt the reactionaries are not all going to go home he 
added i think people really need to continue this fight 
the committee was formed in support of scott tyler a student at 
the school of the art institute of chicago who provoked angry 
protests by displaying a us flag in a work that critics said 
invited desecration by encouraging viewers to trample old glory 
tyler 24 was less optimistic about the impact of the supreme 
court ruling 
all these laws are going to pass in chicago they already 
have tyler said referring to an ordinance enacted the day the

house republicans seeking to keep the ethics 
high ground against the democrats took the unprecedented step 
wednesday of triggering an investigation of one of their own rep 
donald e lukens of ohio 
the action on lukens who was convicted last month on charges 
involving sex with a 16yearold girl came on a show of hands in a 
closeddoor meeting of the republican conference the organization 
of all gop house members 
minority leader robert michel rill sought in a statement to 
portray the move as part of a republican total commitment to 
standards of behavior for members of congress which reflect 
honorably on the institution and the nation 
however house speaker thomas s foley dwash said the 
republicans seemed to be trying to score a political point 
apparently at the expense of one of their own members he said any 
gop attempt to make ethics a partisan issue was absolute nonsense 
and the public knows it 
the house ethic committee formally the committee on standards of 
official conduct had been expected to investigate lukens anyway if 
the committee finds him to have violated house rules it could 
recommend penalties ranging from a reprimand to expulsion 
republicans have set ethics reform in the house among their top 
priorities for the 101st congress and their political operatives 
hope to capitalize in the next elections by pointing to the 
resignations of democratic house speaker jim wright of texas and 
whip tony coelho of california in the face of ethics allegations 
but lukens conviction on may 30 in franklin county ohio of 
contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a minor has been 
an embarrassment to his own party a jury found lukens guilty of the 
misdemeanor charge based on its conclusion that he had sex with the 
girl at his columbus apartment last november lukens 58 and 
divorced is appealing the conviction 
one member of the gop leadership rep robert walker of 
pennsylvania sought to use wednesdays move to turn up the heat on 
democrats suggesting they might do well to put the ethics spotlight 
on their own bad apples 
we have taken that step of asking for an investigation 
walker said i think its an appropriate kind of step to suggest 
that the other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of 
tough thing that is involved in what our conference did today 
newly elected democratic caucus chairman steny hoyer of maryland 
retorted when told of walkers comment im sure democrats are 
prepared to kick out their own members who are convicted of sexually 
abusing children 
although lukens has announced he will seek reelection ohio 
state gop chairman robert bennett has said he will not be on the 
partys ticket in 1990 and the senior member of the states gop 
house delegation rep chalmers wylie has said lukens should do 
the gentlemanly thing and resign 
lukens has vowed to fight and his spokesman said wednesdays 
action was welcome because an ethics probe could once and for all 
bring forth the truth about this entire episode 
the spokesman william jarrell said lukens was hampered in court 
because he was not permitted to cast doubt on the motives and 
credibility of the girl and her mother who were lukens accusers 
now well be able to bring forth the background and the motives 
he said 
meanwhile lukens learned wednesday that a polyp removed from his 
colon was benign spokesman jarrell said lukens was in good health 
and the throat cancer diagnosed in 1984 remains in remission 
in presenting the republican resolution michel said it was 
unprecedented for the conference to call for an ethics probe of one 
of its own members 
the document asks the ethics panel to determine whether rep 
donald e buz lukens failed to conduct himself at all times in a 
manner which reflects creditably on the house of representatives 
it notes that house members in order to perform their 
constitutional duties must conduct themselves with integrity and 
that house rules require conduct which will not bring disrepute on 
the institution 
michel said the gop will live up to its constitutional obligation 
to police its own members no matter how distasteful or painful

president bush continuing to trumpet his 
theme of volunteerism called wednesday for more americans to donate 
time to help protect national parks and other natural resources 
it is time to renew our commitments both to nature and to our 
fellow man bush said at a convention of recreational vehicle 
owners he spoke to a crowd of several thousand people 
bush offering no new specifics outlined to the family motor 
coach association the environmental proposals he has submitted to 
congress 
we need to get the word out that our national parks and other 
federal land management agencies depend on volunteers bush said 
this is just the kind of voluntary local effort it will take to 
bring us into a better partnership with nature 
after speaking at a muddy fairgrounds the president addressed a 
crowd of some 2000 republicans at a 100aplate unity banquet 
praising republican marshall coleman for his gubernatorial primary 
victory bush jokingly offered coleman some free advice 
dont film your tv ads riding around in a tank said bush 
referring to an ad made by democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis that bush frequently made fun of during his election 
campaign last year 
the president said virginia would be a battleground between the 
parties in the 1990s and called coleman a trailblazer 
coleman won a hardfought gop primary last week by defeating 
former sen paul trible and rep stan paris he will face democratic 
lt gov douglas wilder in november 
bush called the gop primary a rough and tumble competition 
but said now that the dust has settled we are all still 
republicans 
we will take our republican message a message of hope and 
opportunity to the black and other minority voters of virginia 
bush said in comments apparently designed to undercut support for 
wilder who could become the nations first elected black governor 
in his speech to the motor coach group bush sought support for 
his environmental proposals to increase federal spending on 
recreational land acquisition by 200 million in 27 states and for 
a like amount in new funding for wetlands acquisition 
on another program bush said his administration would identify 
by the end of the week 25 new backcountry byways for federal 
protection to add to the existing 43 national forest scenic byways 
i want to preserve those picturesque roads that offer power 
views of the nations natural splendor bush said

a commuter is suing the new jersey highway 
authority for 2035 because its discount tokens were always sold 
out and when he did manage to buy some they sold him a slug 
if youve got a mule the only way you can get it to do 
something is to get its attention first paul schlichtman said 
wednesday im filing the suit to get their attention then im 
going to get them to do something give me the money they owe me 
five times last week he tried to buy rolls of tokens for the 
garden state parkway at the essex toll plaza and every time he was 
told they were sold out he said a roll of 40 tokens costs 10 a 
savings of 4 beginning next month 10 will buy only 30 tokens 
the 35 cents demanded in the suit is for a slug schlichtman says 
the highway authority sold him in a roll of tokens he was able to 
buy a toll collector refused to reimburse him for the slug he said 
schlichtmans says his case is solid he collected receipts every 
time he was told there were no tokens and he has the names of the 
toll booth employees 
schlichtman a south orange resident who works in new york city 
said he spends about 1000 a year on highway tolls 
toll booths are a major part of my life he said i spend 
more time sitting at toll booths than i do with any other part of my 
day theyre ridiculous and obnoxious 
highway authority spokesman dennis ingoglia said the agency would 
not comment on the case because it was in litigation 
but he said motorists who are sold slugs can either mail the 
slugs to the highway authority for a refund or get a refund at a 
toll plaza administration building toll collectors are not 
permitted to make refunds he said

the government wednesday closed five 
stock brokerages caught in the biggest scandal in the brazilian 
markets history 
among the houses liquidated was capitanea distribuidora owned by 
elmo camoes who monday quit as president of the central bank 
brazils equivalent to the us federal reserve 
camoes owns 99 percent of the brokerage which was caught short 
in the unprecedented scandal allegedly caused by the speculation of 
a single investor multimillionaire businessman naji nahas 
the liquidations signed by acting bank president wadico bucchi 
also included the brokerages ney carvalho celton titular and beta 
the five houses ran up a debt equivalent to 64 million 
nahas 42 the no 1 investor in brazils 30 billion stock 
market bounced checks worth 31 million to several brokerages used 
to purchase stock futures said the brazilian securities commission 
nahas had borrowed heavily to invest in bluechip stocks taking 
advantage of a rule that allowed him to pay five days later said 
the commission which is the rough equivalent to the us securities 
and exchange commission 
meanwhile he pumped up the stocks price by buying large amounts 
of common stock meaning the shares he received later were worth 
more when banks restricted credit for that type of operation 
nahas checks to several brokerages were returned for lack of funds 
a judge in sao paulo the nations financial center on tuesday 
rejected a request by a prosecutor for the arrest of nahas ruling 
there was not enough evidence to show he was responsible for stock 
manipulation but the justice ministry has barred nahas from leaving 
the country 
there are nine stock exchanges in brazil and nahas had been 
playing principally on the rio market rio and sao paulo are the 
principal exchanges 
the monday after the scandal broke on june 9th the commission 
declared a oneday stock market holiday to prevent panic among 
investors but the government refused to bail out the brokerages or 
the rio exchange 
on saturday rio de janeiro stock exchange president sergio 
barcellos announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence

commission

that saw share prices plunge by more than 34 percent the rio stock 
exchange rose 105 percent and the sao paulo exchanges closed up

a privately financed group studying 
preparations for the nicaraguan election questioned wednesday 
whether the council appointed by the sandinista government to 
oversee the campaign and balloting will be fair 
the bipartisan commission on free and fair elections said the 
appointment of mariano faillos a member of the ruling party as 
president of the supreme electoral council raises questions about 
the independence of the fivemember panel 
in addition the group said it would have improved the 
composition of the body if both of the two members representing 
the political opposition had been drawn from nicaraguas group of 
14 opposition parties 
instead president daniel ortega nominated and the nicaraguan 
national assembly appointed aman sandino a member of the democratic 
conservative party to one of the two slots 
leaders of the group of 14 do not recognize the democratic 
conservatives as an opposition party but consider them allied with 
the governing sandinistas 
nevertheless the commission said sandino is considered a 
dissident in his own party and some say this proves sandinos 
sufficient independence from the sandinistas 
given these perspectives it is uncertain at this point whether 
the five appointments are balanced and fair the commission said 
curtin winsor jr cochairman of the commission who was 
ambassador to costa rica during the reagan administration said the 
commission hopes to meet with the electoral council soon and has 
applied for visas to enter nicaragua sometime this summer 
on june 12 the state department accused nicaragua of trying to 
restrict foreign monitoring of the balloting by requiring americans 
for the first time to acquire entry visas as of july 1 
the commission released letters it has written to president bush 
and secretary of state james a baker iii asking for an opportunity 
to brief them on its work 
former sen gaylord nelson dwis the other cochairman of the 
commission said the group would request a meeting with ortega and 
had begun efforts to meet with other central american presidents 
nelson said a number of trips to nicaragua were planned 
beginning in late july or early august and continuing through the 
elections that are to be held in february under an agreement between 
ortega and the governments of costa rica el salvador guatemala and 
honduras 
margarita suarez press officer for the nicaraguan embassy said 
she assumed the visas would be granted but the official position 
is that the only people who will be allowed to be observers are 
those that have been invited to be observers by the government 
there is really no restrictions on the visas unless someone is 
really undesirable ms suarez said there is no new 
qualification that people must go through simply because they are 
americans 
ms suarez said the embassy had not yet received a copy of the 
commissions report 
the commission said its proposals were but the minimal 
requirements for a free and fair electoral campaign and election 
they are consistent with central american practices and are by 
no means ideal standards or an attempt to impose us practices on 
nicaragua the panel said 
the commission which held hearings here may 911 is sponsored 
by the conservative world freedom foundation 
the group said that international observers press and 
broadcast media must have the right to travel throughout the country 
during the campaign to monitor the electoral process 
it said polling must be permitted there must be reasonable 
opposition access to press radio and television and laws giving 
the government censorship and control over media outlets must be 
suspended during the campaign 
it proposed that nicaragua which has no voter registration 
system establish one by the beginning of the campaign on sept 1 
although few countries in latin america allow absentee voting 
the commission said a significant number of nicaraguans now live 
abroad in exile and fairness calls for some form of participation 
by these people in deciding their homelands future

after years of touring the world winning rave 
reviews in dozens of languages and being the first major american 
ballet company to tour the soviet union the dance theater of harlem 
opened its 20th anniversary season wednesday night with a 
performance of giselle 
arthur mitchell executive director and cofounder of the 
company spoke before the start of the perfomance thanking the city 
center audience for its support and the city of new york for a 25 
million grant that will be used to renovate the harlem facility and 
other properties 
the fact that we have survived and gotten here in 20 years is a 
miracle mitchell said 
dancerchoreographeractordesigner geoffrey holder and his wife 
the dancer carmen delavallade congratulated mitchell and the 
company during opening ceremonies to celebrate the anniversary 
holder said the company was an inspired idea and that 
mitchell had a lot of courage 
arthur is a gem cutter said miss delavallade he went into 
a harlem garage with all these wonderful jewels and formed a crown 
and placed it in harlem 
two decades ago the talented and brash principal dancer from the 
new york city ballet sliced through the racial barriers that had 
kept blacks from succeeding in classical ballet and founded the 
vibrant and youthful company mitchell who retired from the city 
ballet in 1970 has led the troupe to international renown but has 
kept its roots firmly planted in harlem 
the original dance school remains in the primarily black uptown 
manhattan neighborhood and many of this seasons new york 
performances will be held in aaron davis hall at city college 
the dance theater of harlem prides itself on preserving american 
dance repertory and does an excellent job of presenting works that 
otherwise would disappear because they are not performed the 
company also demonstrates a variety of styles and moods from the 
classical swan lake to the neoclassical serenade to the 
contemporary and ethnic dougla to the folk ballet john henry 
last year the troupe captivated audiences in the soviet union 
with its magical retelling of john taras stunning firebird set 
to the original igor stravinsky score 
the companys giselle which had its new york premiere in 
1984 after a london debut is a departure from the traditional work 
set in austria this giselle takes place in louisiana in the 
years following the civil war it is as creole as crawfish and 
gumbo and just as luscious with its mossy sets and pastel costumes 
frederic franklin who danced with the ballet russe de monte 
carlo from the 1930s50s staged the ballet for the company without 
departing too much from the choreography by jean coralli and jules 
perrot 
the lithe virginia johnson the companys prima ballerina danced 
the title role of the young woman who dies of unrequited love she 
was partnered with eddie j shellman who is paired with her in many 
of the companys works shellman whose barrel turns and leaps have 
made him a standout in the troupe portrayed the callous suitor 
albert 
miss johnson displayed a wonderful technical astuteness en 
pointe and judy tyrus who will dance the lead on june 25 was 
perky and refreshing in her pas de deux with augustus van heerden 
during its new york run through july 2 the dance theater of 
harlem will perform works from its repertoire including 
balanchines allegro brillante mitchells holberg suite and 
glen tetleys voluntaries the company also will premiere works

the military has agreed to participate 
in talks toward ending the political crisis involving defense forces 
chief gen manuel antonio noriega the government said wednesday 
the military will be included in the government delegation 
foreign minister jorge ritter said in a letter to jorge baena 
soares secretarygeneral of the organization of american states 
the talks among the government military and opposition were 
proposed last week by an oas mission which has made two trips to 
panama since the government annulled a may election that foreign 
observers said the opposition won handily the government had 
insisted that noriega the countrys de facto leader was not 
negotiable but wednesdays foreign ministry statement which 
included excerpts from ritters letter made no mention of noriega 
ritters letter was apparently an effort to circumvent a deadlock 
caused by noriega insistence the military had nothing to do with 
politics noriega had said talks to resolve the crisis should be 
between the government and the opposition 
acting president manuel solis palmas government reiterates its 
decision to take part in a dialogue between panamanians to try 
overcome the grave problems confronting the nation ritters 
letter said 
the government will be represented by the executive branch 
which includes the defense forces it added 
in the letter ritter indicated the oas should help draw up an 
agenda for the talks on the basis of a concensus among those 
taking part to serve as a basis for discussion of the panamanian 
nations problems 
opposition groups demanding that noriega step down said last week 
they were willing to take part in the talks 
noriega was indicted in 1988 by federal grand juries in florida 
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering efforts by the 
united states to oust him including economic sanctions against 
panama have failed 
noriega had the legislature which he controlled fire president 
eric arturo delvalle in february 1988 a day after delvalle tried to 
fire noriega the legislature then named education minister solis 
palma acting president but the us has insisted on recognizing 
delvalle as panamas legitimate president 
the crisis deepened when the government claimed its candidate 
carlos duque of the national liberation coalition won the 
presidential election may 7 
opposition groups and foreign observers including several from 
the united states said there was widespread fraud in the election 
and that the opposition candidate guillermo andara of the 
democratic civilian alliance won by a 3to1 margin 
as the crisis grew a governmentcontrolled election board 
annulled the election the government had planned to install the new 
president on sept 1 
the oas called in to try solve the crisis sent a delegation of 
top diplomats late in may then a second one last week to try and 
get the government the military and the opposition to negotiate 
the delegation headed by baena soares included foreign 
ministers diego cordovez of ecuador mario palencia of guatemala and

chinese students across the nation have sent a 
letter to congress urging stricter sanctions against their homeland 
and to express their impatience with the bush administrations 
response to the beijing killings 
what bothers me is not what is being done but what is being 
said said pei min xin a graduate student at harvard university 
who helped draft the letter 
secretary of state james a baker says we should treat this 
relationship as a very important one to preserve but for all 
intents and purposes the relationship is dead and gone he said 
wednesday 
the letter cosigned by chinese student organizations from 68 
american universities including harvard and yale university 
bushs alma mater and scotlands university of edinburgh says 
economic and diplomatic sanctions against the hardline chinese 
government can be as effective as us sanctions were against 
polands communist regime 
congress should now take the lead in promoting universal 
respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
by themselves imposing sanctions against the goverment of deng 
xiaoping and by urging americas allies to do the same the letter 
said 
the organizations that signed it represent more than 7000 
chinese students said pei who tuesday appeared before us houses 
subcommittee on international banking and outlined the letters 
proposed economic sanctions 
pei a 31yearold political science student said the united 
states relationship with china is outdated despite bushs personal 
interest in the country where he formerly served as ambassador 
the relationship was built on a common fear of the soviet 
union said pei the threat from the soviet union has diminished 
a great deal toward the west and the united states and has 
disappeared against china 
the letter calls for the following steps if the chinese 
government does not cease and desist from further atrocities 
the removal of chinas most favored nation trade status 
freezing all credit to china from the world bank the 
international monetary fund and the asian development bank 
reimposing restrictions on exports to china regulated by the 
commerce department 
these sanctions must remain in place until martial law is 
lifted and all reprisals against the leaders and supporters of the 
prodemocracy moveent are terminated the letter said 
if china continues to arrest the demonstrators and does not 
commute the death sentences imposed on some the chinese students 
propose 
the us ambassador to the united nations should call for 
emergency sessions of the un security council and general assembly 
ending all credit guarantees against china 
suspension of the procession of chinas application to 
membership in the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
intertional trade body 
on wednesday the chinese government executed three men for their 
roles in the studentled protests that ended when the army moved 
against students and supporters in beijing on june 34 killing up 
to 3000 people according to some estimates

republican sen phil gramm plans to welcome 
super collider managers to texas the day before the house votes on 
building the particle accelerator and an upset democrat from the 
state charged wednesday that could jeopardize asyet unvoted funds 
for the 44 billion project 
it will be hurtful to us for members of congress to be reading 
gramm is gloating over the collider at the same time we are trying 
against a lot of odds to protect the gains we have made so far on 
this project said rep john bryant 
this is a time in which we need to be careful and humble 
rather than to be seen as bragging 
gramm spokesman larry neal said tuesdays ribboncutting at the 
energy departments new super collider offices in desoto a dallas 
suburb is intended to generate local support 
fully 50 percent of the gains that texas has made on the ssc 
are directly attributed to the senator neal said 
congressman bryants history on the collider is one of 
refusing to become involved of offering no support and of finally 
whining at length when he was required to take some action while 
gramm is at least 
the house appropriations committee on tuesday voted 200 million 
for the project in the new budget 110 million of which is the 
first substantial slice of construction money 
bryant said there may be an attempt to strike the 200 million in 
floor debate next wednesday the day after the ribbon cutting in 
desoto there is substantial opposition to the project in the house 
from members who believe its vast cost will starve other equally 
worthy scientific research 
we are certainly a long ways from being out of the woods on 
this project bryant said gramms zeal for getting headlines 
for himself could endanger a critical texas project 
henry gandy director of the texas office of statefederal 
relations said i dont think it will affect the vote in the 
house 
rep joe barton a republican whose district includes the super 
collider site called gramms visit appropriate the complaints a 
tempest in a teapot

federal investigators have asked the navy to 
retrieve a cargo door that tore off a boeing 747 jet over the 
pacific ocean nearly four months ago sending nine passengers to 
their deaths 
the door is believed to be resting on the ocean floor more than 
three miles underwater and about 85 miles southwest of honolulu 
united and boeing which would share in the cost said they support 
the recovery effort 
the national transportation safety board asked the navy to search 
for the door ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said tuesday the navy 
said wednesday it has not received a formal request 
united has encouraged the ntsb to look for the door said 
spokesman rob doughty 
were glad theyve made that decision doughty said it may 
answer some questions that may be lingering 
doughty said he didnt know when the search would be made but 
abc said tuesday its scheduled for october 
ntsb investigators have said retrieving the door would help 
determine what caused it to pop open at an altitude of 22000 feet 
on feb 24 ripping a 10by20foot hole in the fuselage but 
recovering it is not considered essential lopatkiewicz said 
the jumbo jet was flying from honolulu to auckland new zealand 
when the accident occurred the pilots managed to return to honolulu 
with the 345 people still aboard

american and soviet mountaineers who plan to climb 
mount everest to promote peace and environmentalism met their 
chinese counterparts wednesday and tried to sidestep questions 
about chinas troubles 
we dont know a lot about politics but i think we all know a 
little bit about mountain climbing jim whittaker leader of the 
mount everest earth day 20 international peace climb told a news 
conference at the seattletacoma international airport 
we come here for the peace of the world chinese delegation 
leader liu da yi said through an interpreter we hope to have good 
cooperation 
chinese mountaineers in the 30member climbing team were delayed 
more than a week in reaching the united states for practice climbing 
on mount rainier because of restrictions on travel in china 
following the military crackdown there 
the team comprised of 10 citizens of each country plans to head 
for mount rainier on saturday after planning sessions and a 
fundraising reception 
whittaker said the team will train at least through tuesday at a 
base camp and a highlevel camp that have been established on the 
14410foot peak 60 miles southeast of seattle 
the climb next year is intended to show that people from the 
three nations can work together to reach the highest point on earth 
said whittaker who in 1963 became the first american to stand atop 
everest he said its the first time mountaineers from the three 
countries have joined in a major climb 
we will stand on the summit of everest three people one from 
each country with our arms around each other because we are 
brothers not only under one sun but brothers as mountain 
climbers he said 
the group will try to get as many climbers as possible to the 
summit of the 29028foot himalayan mountain he added 
the mountaineers hope to get the first team onto the peak on 
april 22 the 20th anniversary of earth day whittaker said 
the expedition plans to pack its own trash down the mountain and 
bring out as much trash from previous climbs as possible greenpeace 
and other environmental groups have volunteered to help remove 
waste whittaker said 
the climbers plan to approach the mountains north side through 
china and tibet the cost of the expedition was put at 1 million 
and whittaker said additional sponsors were being sought 
pressed about the turmoil in china whittaker said he welcomed 
the publicity it drew to the expedition 
wed like the events of the past few weeks to focus on this 
group of citizens that are working together for a common goal of 
peace and the human environment he said 
i think there is even more reason for this group to be 
together we had no idea that those problems would occur 
but whittaker said the expedition is even more important for 
the citizens of this world when we rope up on that mountain we 
are trusting our lives to each other i think we have to do that as 
countries 
the chinese delegation leader said the chinese recognize the 
american and soviet climbers are more experienced we will be the 
pupils 
soviet leader vladimir shatayev said he was eager to get back to 
mountain climbing were happy our chinese friends have come to 
climb he said through an interpreter

exxon corp and other big oil companies say 
theyll spend 250 million over five years to sharpen their ability 
to combat massive oil spills and the bush administration is 
stepping up surveillance of the alaska oil system 
the major oil companies in their first comprehensive step to 
improve contingency planning for big spills said tuesday they will 
create a nationwide network of response teams capable of handling an 
accident as large as the exxon valdez disaster anywhere on us 
coastal waters 
the plan is voluntary which environmental groups and some 
members of congress said minimizes its importance and underscores 
the need for federal legislation to require better response 
capabilities 
when it comes to the protection of our fragile environment 
good faith simply is not good enough said sen joseph i 
lieberman dconn he said he will introduce legislation thursday to

a handful of nuts a day may keep the heart 
attack away according to a group of california researchers 
a sixyear study of diet and fatal coronary heart disease among 
34000 california members of the seventhday adventists church found 
that nuts were the only food item listed with a statistically 
significant protection against heart attack death 
compared to a person who never ate nuts a person who ate them 
at least once a day had only 47 percent of the risk of fatal heart 
attack said dr gary e fraser coauthor of a study presented 
tuesday at the 2nd international conference of preventive cardiology 
making this even more significant is that a year ago we looked 
at nonfatal heart attacks and got findings that were extremely 
similar said fraser nuts seem to reduce the risk of both fatal 
and nonfatal heart disease

along louisianas marshy coast its always been 
hard to tell where the land ends and the water begins but the line 
is changing about an acre of rich marshland sinks under water every 
15 minutes and the problem isnt confined to louisiana as reported 
in the first story of a twopart series disappearing wetlands 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from california to the rocky coast of maine 
whats left of the nations wetlands and barrier islands is 
disappearing nowhere is it going faster than in louisiana where 30 
to 50 square miles of marshy coastline wash away every year 
shrimp fishermen pull trawls over the port eads schoolyard where 
clive duet 73 used to play water 4 feet deep covers the 160acre 
farm near galliano where joe billiot 51 lived as a child 
a 200yearold oak tree stands dying on land near theriot bought 
in 1840 by the greatgrandfather of marvin marmande jr salt water 
once more than a quartermile off has eaten away the marshes and 
now soaks the trees roots 
louisiana with 40 percent of the nations remaining coastal 
wetlands suffers 80 percent of the annual loss its fragile marshes 
are the nurturing grounds for a yearly seafood harvest worth almost 
1 billion the habitat for 40 percent of the countrys furbearing 
animals and the wintering home for nearly 5 million migratory birds 
about half of louisanas marshes have disappeared since world war 
ii wiped out by such natural forces as hurricanes and by levees and 
dams 
in alaska the nations worst oil spill has devastated long 
stretches of coastline but the alaskan wetlands however damaged 
remain eventually they will renew themselves the louisiana 
marshes are gone quietly without drama without nightly newscasts 
without crowds of volunteers 
robert e stewart jr director of the national wetlands research 
center in slidell an arm of the us fish and wildlife service 
said people in europe when ive had the occasion to speak over 
there have said the united states is the most developed the most 
forwardlooking the brightest country in the world how could you 
let this happen 
the simple truth is that we didnt know 40 years ago that it 
was going to happen a lot of the things that started this occurred 
40 years ago and we didnt have the ability to forecast the 
effects 
dave carney a biologist with the army corps of engineers said 
it was only recently that the corps began considering the 
environment as important as flood control and navigation 
in addition carney said it wasnt until 1969 that the 
national environmental policy act imposed a system for rigorous 
environmental examination of federal projects and activities 
many decisions were made long before that tremendous 
investments the whole mississippi river tributaries project all of 
the oil and gas exploration and investment that are now regulated 
were not regulated to that degree back in the 1940s and 1950s when 
these things started popping 
im not saying all of those decisions are irreversible but 
many of them are irreversible commitments of resources and 
decisions made in louisiana before the implications were ever 
imagined 
the scope of the problem is enormous for one thing louisianas 
400milelong coast translates to almost 7000 miles of shore when 
the dips juts and loops of bays inlets and peninsulas are 
included for another the biblical separation of earth and water 
never quite took hold in coastal louisiana and solid objects tend 
to sink in the marshes that merge with the gulf of mexico 
i cannot find any coastal marsh loss rate higher than that of 
louisiana anywhere stewart said but he also emphasized the 
problem was not confined to louisiana 
the united states has lost about 54 percent of its wetlands 
since settlement he said there have also been great losses in 
the dakotas california has lost 90 percent of its wetlands 
you see the same thing in texas mobile bay tampa bay go 
around the florida coast and you see the same thing the florida 
everglades are undergoing tremendous change largely because of 
human impact 
georgia and the carolinas the same sort of thing but to a 
lesser degree its really a more stable coastline so you dont 
have the subsidence you have here you have losses in chesapeake 
bay the net is a loss in all of those areas 
the decisions that affected louisiana were made with clear logic 
and compelling motives but no consideration of longrange harm 
a strong young nation tamed its biggest river system with dams 
and levees first making it a reliable transportation artery then 
keeping it from overflowing nobody pondered how the marshes would 
live without replenishment from siltladen fresh water 
a vigorous oil industry moved into louisianas marshes and the 
gulf of mexico 50 years ago dredging canals to get drilling rigs to 
the oil and to lay pipe to offshore fields nobody considered the 
effects of saltwater canals through freshwater marshes 
and when 27 sets of locks and dams were built on the mississippi 
and the missouri and a giant irrigation project was built far to the 
north in the dakota badlands nobody thought of the louisiana 
marshes 
each one of these dams is a sediment trap stewart said 
they have reduced the sediment substantially in a freeflowing 
system there was up to 500 million tons a year 
it took 700 years for mississippi river sediment to build the 
marshes of the current delta 
it took 22 years from 1956 to 1978 for half of those marshes 
more than 1000 square miles to disappear 
we took a very dynamic system and made it stable stewart 
said and there were some totally unforeseen consequences 
natural forces were at work too spongy soil compresses under 
its own weight salt water levels are rising slowly and hurricanes 
can wipe out miles of marshes in a day 
you take one like betsy in 1965 and it just rolls the marsh up 
like a rug stewart said 
hurricanes pile up walls of water in front of them those tidal 
surges used to dissipate over miles of marshes now they funnel 
through canals and navigation channels spreading salt water miles 
inland killing vegetation and carving up the wetlands 
environmentalists blame big oil and the corps of engineers 
it comes with the territory carney said of the criticism 
in a way the buck does stop here people can study it talk about 
it but eventually anything that is going to be done will be done by 
the state and the corps of engineers in some cooperative way 
h leighton steward chairman chief executive officer and 
president of louisiana land and exploration co says the oil 
industry has been unfairly targeted 
llampe which owns more than 600000 acres of marshland the 
largest private holding of coastal wetlands in the united states 
makes most of its money from oil and gas on its land but also 
leases tracts for hunting and trapping 
steward estimated that hunting for petroleum in the marshes and 
dredging canals to reach oil and gas deposits caused about 10 
percent of the loss 
the remaining 90 percent has been due to natural forces 
exacerbated by the trapping of the mississippi in its current 
channel steward said 
we dont claim we are absolutely guiltless steward said 
because when you build a canal through wetlands you are going to 
chew up a certain amount of wetlands

to marvin marmande jr the dying oak is a 
symbol 
it was a beautiful fullgrown tree when my greatgrandfather 
first saw it 140 years ago i remember when i was 7 or 8 years old 
having picnics with my mama and the family here and the branches 
spread way over there marmande 31 said sweeping his arm toward 
a point 30 feet away 
now its dying its roots are in salt water 
the plight of the 200yearold live oak mirrors whats happening 
to all marshland in coastal louisiana erosion and subsidence claim 
3050 square miles of wetland each year 
our way of life is going with it marmande said there used 
to be 70 families making a living on this land this was all 
farmland sugar cane and potatoes mostly and cattle 
this land used to support seven families just for trapping 
muskrat otter mink now theres just one we used to catch worlds 
of crawfish here but its salt water now 
the marmande land is on a finger of high ground built by 700 
years of spring floods on the mississippi river the fresh water 
marshes that surrounded the peninsula were nourished by bayous and 
streams running from the river to the gulf of mexico 
the river is trapped by levees now and the bayous and streams no 
longer carry fresh water to the marshes 
the 8milelong marmande peninsula about a halfmile wide at its 
landward base ends at a 60acre plateau that stands a dizzying 7 
feet above sea level really high ground in these parts 
you cant get there except by boat marmande said the 
roads under water in a couple of spots used to be 3 or 4 feet 
above sea level 
much of the damage has been done by the houma navigation canal a 
straightshot channel dredged 30 years ago to provide quicker access 
to the gulf of mexico some of the salt water comes up through cades 
lake and minors canal 
marmande believes in levees and pumps to isolate the sources of 
salt water and hold back erosion 
look at what theyve done in holland theyve reclaimed land 
from the sea he said 
he points to a neighbors land where a distinct line shows the 
intrusion of salt water a vigorous green stand of cypress on one 
side of the line naked brown stumps on the other side 
he built his own levee and put in his own pumps marmande 
said but you cant get permits to do that anymore we cant even 
get permits to raise a levee thats been there 14 years and its 
sinking 
i consider it my obligation to try to do something about it 
maybe we can never put it back the way it was but we can stop it 
from getting worse

addie authement tied his squarebowed 
work boat to a piling 150 yards out from the shore of lake boudreaux 
me and my boy stuck this piling here on dry ground when he was 
about 15 years old hes 34 now and theres about 5 feet of water 
here we trawl for shrimp all around that piling authement said 
the piling is painted red a red reflector is fixed to its top 
it used to mark the entrance to a narrow channel that authement and 
his brother dug to get their pirogues to the lake 
it was just wide enough to pushpole our pirogues a 
littlebitty canal not even a canal a ditch he said 
it became a canal about 20 years ago when terrebonne parish 
widened it to about 10 feet installed a pumping station and began 
using it to drain rain water flooding into lake boudreaux 
the canal is 2030 feet wide now and getting wider its banks 
crumbling with every storm wind 
salt water from the gulf of mexico killed groves of tall cypress 
trees and old oaks leaving stark dead stumps salt water also 
killed the marsh grass that fed muskrat and nutria 
a dank salt water bay covers land that was a garden patch when 
authements son was born 
whod have told me 30 years ago that id be catching crabs 
there some day id have told them they were lying authement 
said the son of a gun stinks too 
much of the land loss became inevitable 50 years ago when the 
corps of engineers completed flood control projects on the 
mississippi river levees trapped the river robbing the marshes of 
fresh water and silt and the spongy wetlands began contracting and 
sinking beneath the water 
that used to be a big coteau real high ground he said 
pointing to an oak stump jutting out of the water its trunk about 4 
feet in diameter i used to shoot squirrels there 
authement and his wife celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary 
in april in the early years of their marriage they shelled shrimp 
for 12 cents an hour shucked oysters for 50 cents a gallon fished 
and sold sundried shrimp 
it was hard but it was a good life he said 
he blames the houma navigation canal for most of the problems 
dredged to provide straightline access from houma shipyards to 
oilfields in the gulf the canal also gives salt water access to the 
marshes 
forty years for all of this to go from fresh water to salt i 
dont believe we have 30 years left unless somebody does 
something authement said

it took 700 years for the mississippi river to 
build the marshes near its mouth but half of them have disappeared 
in the last 30 years is there any way to stop the loss any way to 
restore whats gone this second segment in a series disappearing 
wetlands considers what can be done 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the mississippi river built louisianas 
wetlands and only the mississippi can restore them 
louisiana loses an acre of its productive wetlands every 15 
minutes at that rate washington dc would be swallowed up in 
about 14 months 
an estimated 10 percent to 20 percent of louisianas loss is due 
to exploration drilling and production of oil and gas in the 
marshes and offshore the main reason for the rest of the loss is 
that man in taming the mississippi with dams and levees cut off 
the supply of fresh water and silt that kept the wetlands green and 
growing 
any plans for rebuilding marshes involve getting mississippi 
river water back where it used to flow naturally but that calls for 
bigticket items the army corps of engineers is committed to 
spending 130 million for just three freshwater diversion projects 
one under construction at caernarvon about 15 miles downriver from 
new orleans the others in final planning stages 
this is an impoverished state with no money to spare its 
teachers are among the nations lowest paid its police and fire 
departments are cut back to the bone its roads are crumbling and 
its universities are underfunded unemployment is at 117 percent 
the cheaper less dramatic route would be to save whats left if 
possible or delay its loss there are plenty of proposals from 
planting trees to tearing down the levees 
the us soil conservation service is testing marsh grass and 
mangroves to find the toughest strains to help defeat wave action 
and tie down fragile soil 
state and federal agencies are issuing fewer permits for wetlands 
activities 
some ideas seem too small to have any impact bill good and vance 
edwards spread discarded christmas trees in shallow coastal waters 
henry j rodriguez jr plants trees on marshland hummocks roland 
thomas sets out sprigs of marsh grass piles of old christmas trees 
might trap sediment and slow erosion restoring and protecting the 
marsh roots from new vegetation might also hold sediment 
usually thinking big is the way to go but we may have to 
think small on this problem said dave carney of the army corps of 
engineers the first biologist to be named manager of a wetlands 
restoration project by the corps 
louisiana land and exploration co thinks small in a big way 
400 watercontrol weirs on the 600000plus acres it owns in the 
coastal marshes the land the largest private holding of coastal 
wetlands in the country is dotted with llampes oil wells 
starting in 1956 long before the plight of the wetlands was 
obvious llampe began building weirs across inlets and bayous that ebb 
and flow with the tides the low dams their tops below water level 
are designed to break the force of waves on their way in and slow 
their retreat until they have dropped their load of sediment 
the weirs effects have never been scientifically measured but 
comparisons with unprotected marshes show they work asserts h 
leighton steward chief executive officer and president of llampe 
if there are two little natural channels going back into the 
marsh both about 30 feet wide and you put a little weir on one and 
not on the other we can see that after a time one is still 30 feet 
wide and the other has eroded on back into the marshes steward 
said 
we have areas where we have the weirs in place and another 
land owner maybe a mile over has never had them and our guys can 
demonstrate that our land is in better shape than theirs is he 
said 
dag nummendal of louisiana state universitys geology department 
believes such efforts are a losing fight and the focus should be on 
cutting losses rather than spending billions of dollars trying to 
win 
he advocates a retreat from everything south of highway 90 the 
old eastwest route along a natural ridge from new orleans down 
through morgan city then up to lafayette and westward to lake 
charles 
the louisiana geological survey estimates highway 90 will be an 
oceanfront road by 2083 if nothing is done to reverse coastal 
erosion 
nummendal recommends a rearguard action of weirs pumps and dams 
anything to slow the creeping sea while the residents of three 
dozen coastal communities head for higher ground over the next 50 
years 
thats ludicrous thats too ridiculous even to consider 
said marvin marmande jr a houma businessman and farmer to leave 
would mean abandoning land his frenchborn greatgrandfather bought 
in 1840 i would be abandoning everything my father my 
grandfather and my greatgrandfather worked for if i left 
carney and his fellow project manager at the corps of engineers 
jay warren say rudimentary studies have looked at turning the river 
loose below new orleans 
one proposal involved dredging a new navigation channel to 
connect with the mississippi river gulf outlet canal tearing down 
levees and taking ship traffic out of the mississippi 
essentially it would abandon navigation in the mississippi 
river channel let the channel silt up to whatever depth it wanted 
to about 17 feet and put a lock in the river warren said 
the gulf outlet canal is an underused backdoor path from the gulf 
of mexico to new orleans deemed an economic godsend when it was 
dredged through the marshes 30 years ago a major source of flooding 
in hurricane betsy in 1965 it introduced salt water into previously 
fresh marshes in st bernard parish helping to accelerate the death 
of miles of cypress swamps 
manny fernandez spokesman for gov buddy roemer on environmental 
matters said letting the mississippi go wild below new orleans was 
not realistic 
there are tremendous downsides to that fernandez said no 
1 is the cost no 2 is that youre going through a tremendous 
amount of wetlands doing that excavation of a new channel 
growing up in st bernard parish and seeing the tremendous loss 
and devastation from the gulf outlet i dont believe we ought to be 
looking at dredging another channel to solve environmental 
problems 
carney favors building big sluices to let controlled amounts of 
river water flow through the levees and dump replenishing sediment 
through the marshes the freshwater diversion project at caernarvon 
when completed in two years will dump 8000 cubic feet of water 
into the marshes each second 
fernandez said he and the head of the state department of 
environmental quality paul templet believe freshwater and sediment 
diversion structures hold the answer to restoring the marshes 
paul templet has said we may need as many as 20 of these 
structures rather than the one being built and the two or three 
being contemplated fernandez said it will take that many to 
get the silt back in the marshes

chains of islands are strung like beads along 
americas coasts a barrier that absorbs the force of storms and 
shields the mainland 
but the islands are disappearing at least 50 barrier islands off 
louisiana have washed away over 30 years exposing delicate marshes 
and wetlands to direct assault by the gulf of mexico 
barrier islands are like your skin the first line of defense 
against infection said robert e stewart jr director of the 
national wetlands research center a branch of the us fish and 
wildlife service 
however he said it would be enormously expensive to restore 
them 
something can be done but it would be very very expensive 
echoed jay warren a project engineer with the army corps of 
engineers not only would you have to restore them but then you 
have to maintain them 
we had a study just last year that looked at barrier island 
maintenance as a way to protect marsh behind the barrier islands and 
also as a means to reduce storm surge and hurricane damage inland 
even picking up those benefits the cost was just prohibitive 
almost 2700 miles of barrier islands protect the coasts of 18 
states along the atlantic and the gulf of mexico and all of the 
islands are threatened the west coast has fewer barrier islands 
but they are also eroding and drifting inland 
fire island a sliver of sand and expensive cottages just east of 
new yorks long island is losing beaches on both the seaward and 
landward sides despite groins and jetties built to save them a 
million cubic yards of sand shift along the coasts of both cape 
hatteras and cape cod each year 
texas galveston island has been protected by seawalls since a 
hurricane killed 6000 people in 1900 but its beach eroded after 
the wall was built the sort of tradeoff made wherever man has 
moved onto the islands 
seawalls jetties groins and rocks all produce the same result 
they direct wave action elsewhere and the beaches wash away 
andy valence is mayor of grand isle louisianas only developed 
barrier island a 2000foot section of its beach is under a state 
of emergency as gulf waters lap at a motels pilings and close in on 
state highway 1 the only route onto the island valence wants to 
build protective rock jetties and estimates the project will cost 
about 422000 
robert jones parish engineer and civil defense director for 
nearby terrebonne parish predicted the project would cost 10 times 
that much and would fail unless the rocks were given a sound 
foundation and provisions were made to get fresh sand to the beach 
unless its done right those rocks are just going to eat 
themselves into the sand and disappear he said 
jones has earned his air of authority five years ago he defied 
conventional advice and saved the eastern tip of isle derniere 
where pounding waves were threatening to cut off twothirds of a 
mile 
isle derniere french for last island is the largest of 
louisianas barrier islands at 1800 acres jones repairs have 
withstood eight hurricanes absorbing the force of tidal surges that 
otherwise would have hit coastal communities unchecked 
jones used all natural materials near the area being washed over 
by waves he found deposits of especially coarse sand his crews 
scooped that sand into a protective dune that topped out at 8 feet 
above sea level then filled the holes with the finer sand off the 
gulf floor 
next he hired students to plant seagrass to anchor the sand 
the key to keeping what youve got pumped up on the island is 
vegetation he said 
in the first year of its existence it faced three hurricane 
surges and it was completely overtopped by hurricane juan jones 
said we had a number of hurricanes every year since then 
hurricane gilbert last fall even though it hit 500 miles 
away sent a storm surge here that overtopped every levee in 
southern terrebonne parish the vegetation held up fine 
jones said the best way to save the barrier islands would be to 
put 10 million in trust for 10 islands then use the interest each 
year to restore one at the end of 10 years youd go back and 
start over again he said 
you cant think of it as a oneshot civil engineering problem 
that was my major problem to begin with jones said im used to 
putting something up in concrete and five years later having it look 
the same way 
the first time i went out there after a hurricane i was very 
disappointed the geologists were ecstatic that it survived as well 
as it did

pete kowanko plays the latest in a long line 
of television heroes on the run in his role as the title character 
in the nbc sunday movie the gifted one 
kowanko plays michael grant a man of special mystical powers 
pursued by dr boardman john rhysdavies an opportunistic 
scientist who can hardly wait to experiment on grant to see what 
makes him tick 
michael grants mind uses the full potential that mans capable 
of said kowanko hes gifted he can direct the electrical 
power of his body like a laser to heal he can place himself in 
synch with any living thing or lock into someone elses subconscious 
that gift can also be painful he has an acute sense of right 
and wrong he doesnt want to take advantage of it in a dark way 
nor does he want to be exploited by the military or anyone else 
the chase story is a favorite television premise the most 
popular was the fugitive which ran on abc in 196367 and 
starred david janssen as a man wrongly accused of killing his wife 
and was pursued by law enforcement authorities while searching for 
her killer 
in the immortal on abc during 197071 the lead character 
was a man immune to disease who was on the run because a ruthless 
billionaire wanted his special antibodies the shortlived hot 
pursuit on nbc in 1984 focused on a young couple fleeing a false 
charge of murder and a space alien and his son were chased by 
government scientists in abcs starman in 198687 
the form even inspired a cbs sitcom parody in 196667 run 
buddy run in which a hapless man was on the run from gangsters 
in the gifted one as in the fugitive the hero is on a 
quest of his own while being pursued hes looking for his real 
mother after learning he is not the son of the couple who raised 
him hes running from the people who want to exploit his powers 
the gifted one is not as mystical as kung fu about a 
eurasian monk wandering the old west while being pursued by agents 
of the chinese imperial family and american bounty hunters but 
like kung fu the gifted one features flashbacks to the 
heros childhood 
the movie was to have been the pilot for a possible series but 
the show is not on nbcs fall schedule 
i thought wed get picked up for a series right away kowanko 
said i still think we have a chance for a backup order i think 
its a good alternative its not a cop show its a fantasy he has 
powers but hes not a super human being hes not a space alien 
kowankos own background sounds like the concept for a series 
about a man on the move 
he was born in australia but was raised in california and 
minnesota after his parents divorced he returned to australia at 15 
to mine sapphires with his stepfather he worked in construction 
was a deck hand on a mississippi river towboat waited tables and 
was a ski bum in colorado when he was discovered and asked to 
audition for a commercial 
i was an adventurous soul he said i worked on the 
mississippi river during my huck finn fantasy i worked from st 
paul minn to ste genevieve mo all 27 locks and dams pushing 
15 barges my job as deck hand was to take the barges apart because 
only half could go through the locks at a time 
he went to new york in 1980 and was signed to a development deal 
by abc later he was in the nbc series for love and honor he 
played willie wolf in the movie patty about the kidnaping of 
patricia hearst by the symbionese liberation army 
in the last five years he has moved back and forth between here 
and australia where he and his mother own a fruit farm and vineyard 
in the outback along the tropic of capricorn

americans are turning against marijuana and 
greater sexual freedom large majorities of them also favor stronger 
family ties more emphasis on hard work and less on money 
they especially trust organized religion and twothirds are 
members of a church or synagogue but half think religion is losing 
influence on american life while a third think its increasing 
most think a person can be a good christian or jew without 
attending religious services but 42 percent do so each week a 
third say they have experienced a powerful religious insight or 
awakening 
and most teenagers affirm belief in angels 
these are among the varied facets of faith turned up in recent 
gallup organization polls and summarized by its princeton religious 
research center in its monthly emerging trends 
most of the surveys were among a representative 1200 or more 
with a margin for error of less than 4 percent either way 
one of the most unusual and consistent findings in this age of 
technocracy is that one of every three americans say they have had a 
mystical experience that is a momemt of sudden religious insight 
or awakening 
the center says this is one of the least explored yet one of 
the most fascinating aspects of the spiritual life of americans 
sometimes described as an otherworldy feeling or union with god or 
a universal spirit 
the gallup poll first began exploring the topic in 1962 finding 
that 20 percent then reported such experiences by 1976 the 
proportion had risen to 31 percent and has ranged above that since 
33 percent in 1988 
such an experience often appears to have a profound effect on 
the outlook and direction of a persons life the report says 
adding that the experiences are more often gradual than sudden 
one of the most interesting aspects of these phenomena is that 
they happen to the nonchurched and the nonreligious as well as to 
persons who say religion plays an important role in their 
lives 
on the drugs and sex issues the trend is definitely down during 
the past 10 years public acceptance of marijuana has plunged from 
20 percent in 1978 to 13 percent in 1981 to only 8 percent today 
in the same period overall public demand for greater sexual 
freedom fell from 29 percent in 1978 to 25 percent in 1981 to 22 
percent today with the sharpest downturn among young adults 
although they still are more likely to espouse it 
support for stronger family ties now 94 percent has remained 
close to that throughout the decade so has the support for less 
emphasis on money now 67 percent and for working hard now 70 
percent 
organized religion has for years been rated the most trusted 
institution although the military momentarily surpassed it in 1986 
and still ranks close to it 
the supreme court is close behind with television organized 
labor and big business at the bottom of the list 
the 65 percent reporting church or synagogue membership is the 
lowest ever recorded down from 69 percent the year before the 
record high was 76 percent in 1947 attendance now 42 percent hit 
its high in 1955 at 49 percent 
seventysix percent of americans say one can be a good christian 
or jew and not attend religious services a proportion that has 
changed little for the last three decades 
among us college students about half of those who have heard 
of the new age movement have an unfavorable view of it and only 
14 percent favorable it is a modern optimistic mix of eastern and 
western spiritual ideas 
more teens than ever believe in angels 74 percent of them up 
from 64 percent in 1978 at the same time 29 percent of them say 
they believe in witchcraft up slightly from 25 percent in 1978 
while a majority of teenagers more than 70 percent approve of 
interfaith marriages the proportion has dropped slightly since 
1977 but approval of interracial marragies has jumped from 52 
percent in 1977 to 65 percent now 
concerning church switchers the biggest mobility seems to be 
among methodists only a third raised as methodists still identify 
with that church a tenth raised as roman catholic no longer claim 
it 
the findings indicated more stability among other denominations 
with baptists losing some and presbyterians gaining some and most 
other mainline denominations mostly holding their own

one day this summer the government is going to 
create a giant corporation that will become the biggest business in 
history and the smart money men are watching closely too closely 
for comfort according to some of the people involved in the savings 
and loan bailout 
the new organization will be called the resolution trust corp 
created to handle liquidation of fallen savings and loans and the 
sale of shaky ones under the bill now inching toward congressional 
approval 
there are people out there waiting to pick the resolution trust 
corps pocket before it has its pants on said rep elizabeth j 
patterson dsc 
they will be very deep pockets 
rep henry b gonzalez dtex chairman of the house banking 
committee said the rtc will be responsible for handling more than 
400 billion in real estate and other assets of insolvent savings 
and loans 
under the bailout bill that is to be put into its final shape 
over the next month or so by house and senate negotiators it will 
have a highprofile board of overseers including secretary of the 
treasury nicholas f brady attorney general dick thornburgh and 
chairman alan greenspan of the federal reserve board brady is to 
appoint a chief executive to run the rtc 
asking three of the busiest individuals in government to 
oversee the disposition of hundreds of billions of dollars in real 
estate and other assets is foolish said sen john f kerry 
dmass who wanted a bigger and in his view stronger supervisory 
board the potential for scandal is tremendous 
the bill provides that the federal deposit insurance corp will 
take over the insurance role of the bankrupt savings and loan 
insurance fund and will assume control of insolvent sampls the 
resolution trust corp will be responsible for selling off assets to 
liquidate them with proceeds to help pay for the bailout 
l william seidman chairman of the fdic said liquidating and 
selling sampls is going to be a very unpleasant task costing 
jobs money and guaranteeing lawsuits 
there will be more opportunity for mischief than i would like 
to see seidman said 
neither version of the sampl bill spells out roles very clearly 
seidman said he assumes his fdic will play a part in the liquidation 
operation it has some experience in the field after selling off 9 
billion in assets of failed commercial banks 
kerry said those sales led to 21000 claims and lawsuits on 
transactions that will be dwarfed by rtc operations 
the numbers point to the challenge of finding lawyers 
accountants and appraisers who know the field and are not already 
tied up in sampl cases hiring a boss will present the same problem 
kerry said it will have to be an individual of unquestioned 
integrity with extensive business experience who does not hold a 
position that would present a conflict of interest 
while there is no real blueprint for the operation who does 
what is far from clear seidman said congress has set some 
guidelines 
the senate bill forbids real estate sales at bargain basement 
prices to avoid undercutting markets that already are weak but the 
rtc is supposed to dispose of assets as quickly as possible at the 
best price it can get and holding property off the market would 
create uncertainty that could be just as bad for depressed real 
estate prices the house added a requirement that lowincome housing 
groups get first refusal on the sale of residential property 
as the housesenate conference on the savings and loan bill 
begins work some members still are worried about the corporation 
they are creating 
many of us believe that the resolution trust corp is the 
achilles heel of this bill rep patterson said 
congressional qualms are heightened by the industry talk about 
the bonanza ahead potentially a diamond mine of opportunity 
according to nations building news 
the name of the rtc game will be sales at discounts that 
publication said in its june 5 edition cited by kerry in the 
senate for savvy buyers rtcs regional and local offerings could 
provide years of tempting deals and profits 
the national thrift amp mortgage news advertised an even more 
specialized newsletter resolution trust reporter to begin 
publication on sept 11 reporting on rtc operations it said will 
affect every real estate market developer appraiser and lender in 
the country 
who is going to cash in when the resolution trust corp opens 
its doors that publication asked how about you

american employers in increasing numbers are 
offering workers a taxsaving arrangement called a dependent care 
reimbursement account 
for twoincome couples and single parents this program serves 
much the same function as the traditional tax credit available to 
workers who have dependentcare expenses necessary for them to do 
their jobs 
but the reimbursement account differs in several important ways 
from the tax credit if you have a choice between the two you cant 
pick both financial advisers say you might well come out ahead 
with the reimbursement account 
in a typical case reimbursement accounts are offered to 
employees with children up to the age of 13 or with older 
stayathome dependents who need care 
employees who enroll in the plan figure their expected costs for 
each year and then request that a proportionate sum be withheld 
from their regular paychecks the money withheld is subtracted from 
their taxable income 
after you pay your dependentcare expenses you submit copies of 
your bills or canceled checks to your employer who then reimburses 
you from the money in your account 
if this strikes you as a bit unwieldy youre by no means alone 
you might be put off further by the warning that you need to 
figure your contributions to the account carefully the rules state 
that any unused money in your account at yearend cant be reclaimed 
its gone 
so why go to all the trouble why not just save up your canceled 
checks and take a dependentcare tax credit each year 
well because it might save you some money says the accounting 
firm of coopers amp lybrand for almost everyone the reimbursement 
account will be the better choice 
with such an account people in the upper tax brackets can save 
28 percent or 33 percent on each dependentcare dollar up to 5000 
a year the firm points out 
that compares with a 20 percent tax credit for upperincome 
workers on a maximum of 2400 for one dependent or 4800 for two 
or more 
furthermore you dont pay social security tax at a rate of 751 
percent on the money that goes into your reimbursement account the 
childcare credit has no effect on your social security tax 
in lower income brackets the childcare credit offers a savings 
of up to 30 percent however says coopers amp lybrand most lower 
income people will find this is more than offset by the reduced 
social security and income taxes and possibly by a higher earned 
income credit 
all in all not bad more options for many people in an era when 
tax breaks are disappearing fast 
but theres a catch it is very likely that fewer people much 
fewer one might speculate will take advantage of any writeoffs 
for dependent care in 1989 than have done so in years past 
starting this year whether you use a reimbursement plan or claim 
a dependentcare credit you must specify the social security number 
or taxpayer identification number of the care provider 
this gives the irs a means of checking whether all the money 
claimed as childcare expenses is reported as taxable income by the 
person or organization receiving the payments 
it also defines more clearly cases where you are legally required 
to pay such things as social security tax and unemployment insurance 
for anyone who earns 50 or more working in your home in any 
calendar quarter 
that pretty well puts all dependentcare tax breaks out of reach 
for anybody who doesnt play the game strictly by the book

three months have passed and the sea still 
coughs up dead birds with every change of the tide 
three months have passed and an army of workers 9000 strong has 
yet to completely clean even one heavily oiled beach 
three months have passed and the biggest oil spill in us 
history gets bigger every day spreading its slime farther across 
alaskas wild southern coast pushing its poison deeper and higher 
along the food chain 
we keep hoping for some kind of closure some sign that this is 
all the damage we have and we can deal with it says anne 
castellina superintendent of kenai fjords national park but we 
cant the oil disappears one day when the waves clean a beach only 
to wash up on another beach the next day 
prince william sounds bountiful waters and mountainous islands 
were the first to be fouled after the tanker exxon valdez rammed a 
reef march 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons of north slope 
crude oil 
but the damage didnt stop there streamers of oil and tar balls 
leaked out between the sounds barrier islands and were pushed by 
gulf of alaska currents to beaches 450 miles away 
oil now has tainted more than 700 miles of shoreline from the 
glaciercarved cliffs of kenai fjords to the clamoring bird 
rookeries of katmai national park from lonely cook inlet beaches to 
the mouths of kodiak island salmon streams 
cleanup workers have found the oilsoaked bodies of about 26000 
sea birds 784 sea otters and 57 bald eagles the spreading oil has 
other victims fishermen and other coastal residents who make their 
living from the ocean cringe each week at news of more beaches 
polluted and more fishing grounds closed 
the wreck of the exxon valdez created an environmental 
catastrophe that unfolds in one little tragedy after another 
a wildlife official filming damage on a beach sets a video 
cassette down on a black rock and the rock crawls away it turns 
out to be an oilsmeared duck 
a burly fisherman breaks into tears as he describes steering his 
boat through the slick no water lapping no birds crying just the 
sickening silence of oil slipping past the hull 
at a bird rescue center in seward some of the patients are 
failing they have been washed clean but not before swallowing 
fatal doses of oil they dont cry out instinct tells them not to 
advertise their distress to predators they just get real quiet 
sit in a corner and die says rescue coordinator jay holcomb 
like a candy bar in the hands of a 2yearold crude oil from the 
exxon valdez has gotten onto everything 
rainbow sheens on the water stream from suffocating mats of black 
goop on beaches wind and waves whip oil into a sticky froth that 
workers call chocolate mousse tar balls bob in the surf 
washing ashore to melt in the sun and sink into the sand oil 
splatters driftwood logs high above the tide line and sinks as much 
as 3 feet into gravel beaches undulating blobs of oil hang below 
the waters surface ready to foul fishermens nets 
at first exxon boldly promised to clean it all up 
were going to pick up one way or the other all the oil 
thats out there exxon spokesman don cornett told reporters one 
week after the exxon valdez ran aground 
the promise didnt keep for long 
exxon was too slow and the spill was too big for booms to contain 
the oil immediately after the accident and the company missed its 
chance during the first few days to burn off large quantities of oil 
or disperse it with chemicals some oil was skimmed up but for the 
most part exxon had to wait for oil to wash up on shore where the 
goo could be scraped wiped or flushed painstakingly from rocks and 
gravel 
by may 1 the cleanitall promise had been modified exxon 
proposed to clean 364 miles of coastline by midseptember noting 
that it might have to leave 191 additional miles of lightly oiled 
shore to be washed by nature 
the coast guard approved exxons plan but even the limited 
cleanup may prove beyond the companys capability despite an 
investment of more than 200 million to date 
the cleanup effort now includes more than 9000 workers 800 
boats 45 oil skimmers and 60 airplanes and helicopters hundreds 
of workers clad in rain slickers and hard hats crowd into coves that 
in most years might see a few fishermen or recreational boaters if 
anyone at all 
barges nose up to shore carrying generators and boilers to heat 
the water sprayed from hoses on the beach skimmers just offshore 
pick up oil as it flushes off the beach while yet more vessels tend 
containment booms to keep the washedoff oil from spreading 
where there isnt enough machinery workers hit the beaches with 
shovels absorbent pads and plastic bags scooping and scraping and 
wiping by hand 
it has become pretty laborintensive says exxon spokesman 
amos plante 
the coast guard which is overseeing exxons cleanup effort has 
signed off on about 50 miles of shoreline along prince william 
sound but that doesnt mean a beach is clean it just means exxon 
can move on even the most intensive scrubbing cannot touch oil 
imbedded deep within a beach 
the word clean is now taboo on official forms used to track 
exxons efforts workers dont clean beaches anymore they treat 
them 
the difference is more than semantics as a visit to a prince 
william sound beach with a state environmental official shows 
this says steve provant as he kicks an oily rock is a 
treated beach 
provant the onscene cleanup coordinator for the alaska 
department of environmental conservation is standing on a green 
island beach known to officials as gr1a the coast guard signed off 
on this beach may 29 declaring that exxon crews had completed 
removal of gross contamination provant saw it back then and it 
looked pretty good he says 
but now the oil is back globs of mousse litter the cobbled 
beach rainwater beads up on the rocks as it would on the waxed hood 
of a car provant digs into the sand and his hand comes up greasy 
brown 
if you dig you find oil down quite a ways provant says 
you can see how much oil has been washed back in or has percolated 
up from below were really not through with this beach 
provants agency hounds exxon suggesting ways the cleanup could 
run more efficiently exxon state and federal officials spend hours 
each day arguing over how deeply to clean particular beaches or 
whether cleaning them will do more harm than good 
everybody wants a clean beach us included says exxons 
plante the definition of clean is subject to interpretation what 
were obviously going to do is work as hard to do the best job we 
can we may have some disagreements over whether its sufficiently 
clean

while the arguments rage onshore the death toll mounts at sea 
stymied by vast distances and stormy weather bird rescuers have 
been able to capture clean and release only about 500 sea birds 
for every surviving bird more than 50 dead ones lie in freezer vans 
more than 26000 in all and thats just a fraction of total 
mortality some biologists say that for every dead bird collected 
perhaps 100 have died unnoticed 
sea otters appear to be the hardesthit marine mammal the 784 
dead sea otters collected so far represent about onetenth of prince 
william sounds total population harbor seals may be suffering 
too but few carcasses have been found dead seals sink like lead 
balloons explains state marine biologist kathy frost 
the oils lethal reach extends down the food chain on some 
beaches mats of oil have wiped out all life suffocating intertidal 
creatures such as limpets mussels crabs and starfish 
and the oil reaches upward to the tops of tall shoreside spruce 
trees where bald eagles roost oiled sea birds have become a fatal 
attraction for scavenging eagles killing 57 of the birds of prey 
biologists have collected lifeless eggs from 30 abandoned eagle 
nests in the spill area 
hungry brown bears on the shores of katmai national park have 
feasted on oily bird carcasses until they could eat no more digging 
holes in the sand to cache the leftovers 
bears are hardy creatures but biologists have radiocollared 30 
of them to study their reaction to swallowing so much oil we 
havent determined what effect it has on them but i can imagine 
what it would do to me says katmai national park superintendent 
ray bane 
at the very top of the food chain are the humans who live close 
to nature in coastal villages when aleut natives complained that 
the oil spill kept them from gathering food through fishing and 
sealhunting exxon flew in cases of beef chicken and diced ham it 
gave the villagers stomachaches 
many commercial fishermen have been idled by the spill though 
some have landed jobs with exxon leasing their boats at rates of 
3400 a day and more 
most of the salmon and halibut swimming beneath the oil appear to 
be surviving but fisheries worth more than 110 million have been 
canceled or postponed by alaska officials worried that surface oil 
might taint fish as they are hauled from the water in fishermens 
nets 
as spring turns to summer even exxon officials are starting to 
waver on the question of finishing the cleanup by midseptember a 
deadline long dismissed as unrealistic by some state and federal 
officials 
its always a hope says exxons plante but its tougher 
to predict whether well do it by then thats our plan weve 
always said we will not leave it uncleaned and if that means coming 
back so be it 
the sooner the better for all concerned particularly for 120 
frisky sea otters now swimming restlessly in floating pens theyve 
beaten the odds thanks to rescuers at an otter hospital in seward 
the animals are clean healthy and ready to return to the wild 
but they must stay put biologists say because the wild is not 
ready for them

the rhetoric surrounding the nations 
worst oil spill sometimes has grown as muddled as the north slope 
crude fouling alaskas southern coast 
just how bad is the spill how is the cleanup going heres a 
look at three months of changing pronouncements promises and 
predictions offered by exxon and other officials 
march 24 the exxon valdez rams a reef spilling nearly 11 
million gallons of oil 
march 25 state environmental officials call the initial 
response by exxon and alyeska pipeline service co inadequate and 
unacceptable alyeska spokesman chuck odonnel says i think our 
people did an excellent job the slick covers 28 square miles 
march 30 were going to pick up one way or the other all 
the oil thats out there exxon spokesman don cornett tells 
reporters in valdez 
march 31 the slick now covers 600 square miles absolutely 
not it has not gotten away from us cornett says we are making 
good progress on this cleanup 
april 18 oil has killed at least 1850 birds and 328 sea 
otters the slick has spread over 3000 square miles exxon chairman 
lg rawl says hes confident most beaches will be clean by 
midseptember 
now im not going to tell you that if you go up there a year 
from now you wont find some black places on some rocks but were 
going to make every effort to get it off rawl says 
may 2 in alaska exxon officials say they now plan to leave 
nearly 200 miles of oiled coastline to be cleaned by nature in 
houston exxon president william d stevens says i believe we in 
exxon have shown our commitment and our determination to deal 
responsibly with the spill and all its effects 
oil shows up in katmai national park 300 miles from where the 
tanker grounded 
may 5 exxon spokesman joe tucker says cleanup is progressing 
on schedule oil is sighted 450 miles from where the tanker 
grounded 
may 9 coast guard vice adm clyde robbins says exxon is as 
concerned with public relations as with cleaning up oil they have 
sent pr people into the field instead of operators he says 
may 10 exxon president stevens tells a congressional committee 
the company fully expects to clean up by midseptember the 
wildlife death toll climbs to 9900 birds and 613 sea otters 
may 24 i dont think that we would portray to you that were 
going to take every stain out of all the rocks that are out there 
says exxon official otto harrison in valdez nor do i want to 
portray to you that i think thats necessary to be environmentally 
clean 
june 1 coast guard commandant adm paul yost says he sees 
progress but predicts that exxon almost certainly will miss its 
midseptember deadline i think there was too much optimism he 
says i think reality has set in 
june 14 exxon officials hedge on their september deadline 
its always a hope says exxon spokesman amos plante in seward 
but its tougher to predict whether well do it by then thats 
our plan weve always said we will not leave it uncleaned and if 
that means coming back so be it

alaskas sense of betrayal by big oil is 
leading to stronger regulation of the states most profitable 
industry in the long wake of the exxon valdez oil spill 
it was 12 years ago this week that oil began flowing through the 
800mile transalaska pipeline since then the state has used its 
oil wealth to build roads and schools boost its economy and keep 
its taxes low 
but in the 12 weeks since the spill fouled prince william sound 
alaskans have expressed anger over the industrys broken promise 
that it could protect the environment from such a disaster 
now that weve seen the down side were going to be much more 
cautious about our relationship with the industry said state 
senate president tim kelly a longtime industry supporter 
the message i get from my constituents is the states going to 
have to be more vigilant in its own regulation of the industry and 
we cant depend on the industry or other government entities to do 
that for us kelly said 
state legislators last month passed an initial package of bills 
aimed at preventing future spills and narrowly approved a measure to 
cut an oilindustry tax break the change will cost the oil 
companies operating on alaskas north slope an estimated 2 billion 
over the next 20 years 
bill webb head of an anchoragebased group that represents 
oilsupport businesses is one of the few industry officials who has 
spoken publicly against what they see as political overreaction 
i guess im shocked confused and extremely concerned about 
where the states relationship with its biggest industry is and 
where its heading webb said last week this is the worst ive 
ever seen it 
the tax changes and additional restrictions on the industry sent 
an antidevelopment message about alaska to the lower 48 webb 
asserted 
ive never seen any state thats turned and tried to do damage 
to their industry like alaska has tried to do now webb said 
can you imagine michigan trying to do to the auto industry what 
were trying to do to oil 
kelly said he has seen no signs that alaskas prodevelopment 
image has been tarnished by its recent actions against big oil 
theyre not happy but i think that were playing under a 
different set of rules he said as the new rules are understood 
and stability again returns to the alaska economy i think theyre 
going to work out 
there may be some shortrange exploration and production 
losses but in the long range the fact remains that the industry has 
to go where the oil is the oil doesnt go to them 
republican kelly voted to maintain the oil tax break but he has 
helped lead the postspill campaign for more regulation 
he and other legislators acknowledge that industry state and 
federal officials became complacent about the risks involved in 
transporting oil across alaska 
i think after a decade of no serious and major accidents that 
we assumed that was the norm the anchorage lawmaker said there 
was a tendency of urbanarea legislators to accept at face value 
what the industry told us because a lot of us felt what was good 
for the oil industry was good for alaska 
money helped lawmakers forget the states watchdog role said 
sen pat pourchot an anchorage democrat 
when everybodys making money and everybodys feeling good 
about the economy its natural to think of yourself in partnership 
with the industry youre making money theyre making money its 
sort of a we kind of thing pourchot said 
many recall 1981 as a watershed year for the legislature a year 
in which oil and development concerns began to outweigh 
environmental concerns the republicanled senate especially became 
dominated by industry defenders 
the legislature like the state was infused with new alaskans 
many of whom had benefitted financially from the oil boom and wanted 
to see it last pourchot said 
the whole view of boom boom boom and growth sort of swept the 
state at that point he said 
in 1981 the legislature restructured the way state oil taxes are 
calculated and passed the tax break that remained untouched until 
this year proponents of the changes said the cost to the state 
would be negligible 
in fact it was a billiondollarplus loss to the state after 
just five years said rep sam cotten speaker of the democraticled 
house 
although alaska has spent and saved billions of oil dollars some 
argue that its primary failure in the past decade was not getting 
more money from its oil to secure the states future when the 
pipeline runs dry 
sen jay kerttula a democrat who has served in the legislature 
since 1960 said lawmakers lost sight of their role as stewards of 
the oil for future generations 
the wrinkles were out of the bellies of alaskans they were 
sitting there watching tv and not paying attention to their public 
ownership responsibilities he said we werent paying attention 
to the bottom line 
throughout the past decade developmentoriented legislators 
opposed increased funding for the department of environmental 
conservation at times the agency was given additional 
responsibilities without additional funding 
when commissioner dennis kelso took over the department two years 
ago its employees were working a fourday week because of budget 
cuts he estimated then that the agency was 10 million short of the 
budget it needed to meet the minimum requirements of state and 
federal laws 
but kelso insists the cuts did not create the conditions that led 
to the valdez spill and the slow cleanup he blames exxon and 
alyeska pipeline service co the consortium of oil companies that 
runs the pipeline for failing to follow their own policies and the 
stateapproved spillcleanup plan 
next year when most legislators face reelection and a new 
governor will be elected oil industry influence will be a major 
campaign issue cotten says 
but kerttula doubts concern over big oils influence will last 
long in a state that gets 85 percent of its revenues from the oil 
industry 
the industry always wins he said theyve got very strong 
economic clout and theyre very firmly in control

chris campabello once made 10 an hour as a 
clerk in a prudhoe bay oilfield camp now she is working for free 
helping to rescue sea otters caught in the nations biggest oil 
spill 
each day from 6 am to noon she cracks clams and slices fish to 
feed ailing otters each day she feels a little better about 
herself and a little worse about big oil 
i used to believe in the oil companies it was my job and i 
didnt want things to go badly for them she says ive changed 
a lot 
so have many alaskans in the last three months 
the wreck of the exxon valdez unleashed a flood of emotion across 
the nation as people mourned a pristine environments lost innocence 
and voiced anger at those who let it happen for many alaskans the 
anger and grief were compounded by the sense of personal 
responsibility that comes from living in a state heavily dependent 
on oil money 
the relationship of alaskans and oil development has always 
been one of uncomfortable resignation says richard gist a 
community psychologist from overland park kan who helped alaska 
officials respond to the disaster 
while some have likened the spill to a death in the family gist 
says its more like a messy divorce in the end youre always 
telling yourself that you should have known better that you 
shouldnt have trusted the other so much he says 
exxon accepted the blame for the accident but many alaskans 
couldnt help but internalize the guilt gist says 
intellectually folks know better but emotionally lots of people 
feel it they say i must have sold out 
a good way to heal such emotional wounds gist says is to regain 
control by doing something anything to set things right many 
alaskans are following that advice 
cleanup officials and environmental groups have been flooded with 
calls from alaskans wanting to know what they can do to help otter 
and bird rescue centers have more volunteers than they can use 
when the spill hit i got really upset says campabello 29 
who is camping in a tenttrailer while volunteering at the seward 
otter rescue center i felt it was really important not to sit 
back and not do anything 
reaction to the spill has evolved since march 24 the anger has 
turned more to soulsearching i think says dan henry a 
schoolteacher in the southeastern alaska town of haines 
exxon and tanker capt joseph hazelwood are easy to blame 
but we are all to blame henry says the people who are outraged 
are the very same people who moved to alaska because they loved the 
pristine environment and then supported the oil industry they love 
the world around them but they brought their selfishness up with 
them 
he admits he was among them each year eagerly collecting his 
dividend check from the alaska permanent fund a state savings 
account fueled by oil revenues last year the fund distributed 826 
to every alaskan 
my dividend check is blood money henry says i cannot hold 
it in good conscience to accept that money anymore he plans to 
send this years check to an environmental group and is urging 
others to do the same 
gist says volunteering or getting politically active is valuable 
even if it accomplishes nothing but peace of mind the key is doing 
something that gives hope 
henry tells of some school kids in homer who seemed to know that 
without being told as adults frantically built log booms to guard 
the kenai peninsula town from drifting oil the children were on the 
beach scratching messages in the sand they wrote things like 
ocean we love you and were sorry mr sea 
they called them prayers to the ocean and when one of the 
children returned later to the beach she ran to the same spot the 
tide of course had wiped the beach clean but the little girl was 
not disappointed 
look she said the ocean got our prayers

james fenimore cooper would be alive 
today at least in hearts and minds if mark twain hadnt hammered a 
stake through the heart of natty bumppo 
coopers demise as the quintessential author of the american 
frontier stems from a quirky essay written 44 years after his death 
dan porter director of the new york state historical association 
said 
mark twains literary offenses of fenimore cooper put 
deerslayer leatherstocking and nattys other incarnations out to 
pasture somewhere on the prairie of forgotten adventure tales natty 
bumppo was the frontiersman who appeared in coopers stories found 
in the the leatherstocking tales including the last of the 
mohicans the pathfinder the deerslayer and others 
mark really did him in porter said 
the historical association is celebrating the 200th anniversary 
of coopers birth this summer porter hopes to shepherd 150000 
visitors to cooperstowns fenimore house and the farmers museum 
both devoted to pioneer life 
even so that turnout will be just half the average summer gate 
for the other game in town the baseball hall of fame which 
celebrated its 50th anniversary this year 
porter wants cooperstown pilgrims to know that cooper put the 
town on the map a decade before reputed baseball inventor abner 
doubleday created the sport in cooperstown 
unlike twain who remains popular cooper has been relegated to 
the status of having written adventure books for kids and shoved on 
the shelves of schoolchildren who would be just as happy to shove 
him back said cooper aficionado hugh macdougall 
even without twain the wordiness and sermonizing of the last 
of the mohicans and the deerslayer probably would have eroded 
coopers popularity cooper had no editor so his books were printed 
the way he wrote them he considered revising a chore 
twains scorecard credits cooper with 114 literary offenses in 
just twothirds of a page readers couldnt tell coopers living 
characters from his corpses and neither showed sufficient excuse 
for being there twain wrote 
coopers characters also made the most of dialogue wrote twain 
complaining that a cooper characters mouth was a rollingmill 
and busied itself all day long in turning 4foot pigs of thought 
into 30foot bars of conversational railroad iron 
cooper characterizations may leave something to be desired 
his greatgreatgrandson henry sf cooper jr said but he did 
create one wellrounded and extraordinary character with deerslayer 
he has the same strength and immortality as sherlock holmes 
early americas most popular writer cooper was the first to 
break the snob barrier and gain acclaim in europe 
in europe his characters came to represent the typical american 
of the last century said macdougall who has written a guidebook 
coopers otsego county to local sites important to the 
authors works cooper drew on the cooperstown wilderness for many 
of his settings 
cooper was the first novelist of the american frontier the first 
to write sea novels and the first american author to earn his living 
solely as a man of letters 
his vivid descriptions of landscapes inspired the artworks of his 
friends thomas cole and samuel morse and other hudson river school 
painters nineteenth century travel books lifted entire cooper 
passages to describe the american frontier 
his place in american literature is unassailable said henry 
cooper who writes on space issues for the new yorker he really 
put the american novel on the map he created the tradition of the 
lonely hero which transcends the western novel you can find it in 
the novels of theodore dreiser and others 
europeans remain fascinated by coopers writing a german film 
crew shot a documentary about cooper last year and many europeans 
visit fenimore house each year porter said 
the harder critics knock him the more he stands like one of 
those clown balloons with a weight in the bottom that keeps popping 
back henry cooper said 
born sept 15 1789 in burlington nj cooper was an infant 
when his father moved the family to otsego lake called glimmerglass 
in coopers novels a land speculator william cooper had picked up 
100000 acres there in a bankruptcy sale founding the village that 
bears his name 
before he started writing in 1819 cooper was kicked out of yale 
college because of his pranks went to sea as a common sailor and 
served in the navy 
his sailing years were grist for such forgotten sea novels as 
the pilot and the red rover works that influenced herman 
melville and joseph conrad 
besides the five leatherstocking novels works of social 
criticism were among coopers 50 books including a novel about 
totalitarianism predating george orwells 1984 by more than a 
century 
william eastman director of the state university of new york 
press which is publishing cooper works that have been out of print 
for decades thinks the new cooper editions will take the bite out 
of twains essay 
his earlier manuscripts and books were so corrupt full of 
typos and errors that people sometimes didnt know what he was 
writing about eastman said all those funny things twain wrote 
about were caused by typos those things are no longer relevant with 
these new editions 
were going back to his original manuscripts and correcting the 
errors said james beard a cooper specialist at clark university 
in worcester mass who is working on the new editions each time 
they were reprinted they made new errors 
bypassed by railroads and canals cooperstown retains many of its 
19th century landmarks businesses along the villages narrow 
streets also help remind visitors of coopers legacy glimmerglass 
restaurant mohican motel leatherstocking travel 
cooper lived most of his life in cooperstown and is buried in his 
familys private cemetery there 100 miles northeast of twains 
grave in elmira cooper died in 1851 
otsego lake has largely escaped the 20th century as well with 
no large industries and much of the lakeshore acreage owned by large 
landowners the lake remains pristine compared to those in the 
adirondacks to the north credited as the first conservation writer 
cooper urged preservation of natural resources in many of his books 
would cooper be pleased at the condition of his lake compared 
with other lakes today yes compared with the lake he remembers 
probably no said biologist bill harman harman heads oneonta 
state colleges biological field station on otsego lake 
cooper became irascible and wrote little in his last years 
instead suing critics for libel and neighbors for trespassing it 
would have been time better spent writing porter said 
cooper never endeared himself to his public in the way that 
turned alcott hawthorne and thoreau into tourism industries in new 
england he said 
new york has not treated its literary lights well not as well 
as new england has porter said had cooper been less of a 
curmudgeon and more in tune with public relations his fate would 
have been better today

she held her own against a bombastic education 
secretary and turned her huge union into a force for school 
improvement challenges almost equal to her growing up poor and 
black in the segregated south 
now the 2millionmember national education association must 
choose a successor to mary hatwood futrell the voice of the 
teachers union for six years and some say the best spokesman it 
ever had 
the nea should light a candle to mary the organization owes 
her a great deal says ernest boyer president of the 
princetonbased carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
futrell is credited with shifting the neas focus from 
selfprotection to a more professional concern for better education 
under her leadership union delegates approved a carnegie plan for a 
national board to set standards and certify teachers 
the union started spending its own money on curriculum 
innovations and a foundation for education improvement that makes 
grants for dropout and illiteracy prevention programs it also 
cooperated with administrators and principals on a joint guide to 
teacher evaluation 
nea is still a union committed to collective bargaining and 
opposed in principle to merit pay plans supported by many outside 
the teaching field but its recent activities have gone a long way 
toward eroding the obstructionist image that made it such an easy 
target in the early 1980s 
some conservative educators believe futrell has made only 
marginal progress her organization under her leadership has moved 
from the middle ages to the mid18th century and thats quite a lot 
to accomplish in six years on the other hand that still leaves 
them in the mid18th century says chester finn who was an 
assistant education secretary in the reagan administration 
futrell while admitting she would have liked to move faster on 
some issues such as child care and school restructuring defends the 
neas pace we would be the first to admit that our efforts are 
just the beginning she said whats important is that were 
taking the steps weve said we know we must change and lets try it 
incrementally at first 
nevertheless when she presides over her final convention next 
weekend futrell says she will tell the 8000odd delegates that 
you have to do more you have to be bold and you have to take more 
risks what weve done is good but its not enough 
the farflung union has had a reputation not entirely 
undeserved for cumbersome bureaucracy and resistance to change 
former president reagan and former education secretary william 
bennett hammered at those flaws in repeated attacks on nea using it 
as a symbol of all that was wrong with american education 
bennett denounced the nea as intransigent and said its repeated 
calls for more education spending revealed a cashregister 
mentality 
futrell gave as good as she got pointing out that demands for 
higher pentagon spending never inspired that type of rhetoric from 
the reagan administration but out in the field she found teachers 
in despair 
the depression was so heavy she recalled in an interview 
youd go in and it was like you were there as a missionary to try 
to boost the morale of the school month after month after month 
the years under administration fire turned out to have some 
positive effects there was a backlash of sympathy for teachers and 
a new unity within the nea there was also a key decision by futrell 
about three years ago to take the offense to move ahead with an nea 
agenda rather than keep responding to attacks 
futrell says now that had she known what her first three years 
would be like she would not have wanted the job but relying on 
the survival skills she learned as a child she proved a match for 
both reagan and bennett when you live with adversity you 
force yourself to stand up she said you force yourself to 
persevere you force yourself to see positive things 
futrell was raised in lynchburg va by a mother who had dreamed 
of becoming a nurse but was forced by the deaths of her parents and 
later her husband to work as a maid and shortorder cook futrell 
was not yet 5 when her father died 
her mother supported two daughters and two foster daughters on 
15 a week sometimes working 18 hours a day but always found time 
to attend pta meetings she brought home books her employers had 
discarded held weekly spelling bees at home and punished mary when 
her grades were not satisfactory 
as a little girl futrell wrote in an autobiographical essay her 
clothes sometimes had more holes than fabric and she once had to go 
to school without shoes at 8 she started helping her mother dust 
church pews and office desks by 12 she worked fulltime during the 
summer when she graduated from her segregated high school her 
teachers raised scholarship money through local churches to enable 
her to go to college she honored them by becoming a teacher 
herself a business teacher in alexandria va 
moving from state chapter president to national 
secretarytreasurer to nea president futrell emerged as a 
charismatic leader so respected by her members that a room will be 
set aside for tributes to her at the nea convention next weekend 
her achievements win praise even from albert shanker her 
counterpart at the rival american federation of teachers he took 
her to lunch this month for the first time in six years to tell 
her what a great job i think shes done according to shanker 
the people before her were not willing to take the risks or do the 
hard work when she did she got results 
futrell says shell stay active in international education when 
she steps down from her nea post this summer she also wants to 
spend more time with her family and may pursue a graduate degree 
the men vying for her title are keith geiger currently vice 
president of the nea and john wilson a member of the executive 
committee the outcome is expected to hinge on lastminute 
campaigning at the convention 
there are those who think it is impossible for nea to be at once 
an aggressive union and a respected professional association but 
futrell says she has spent six years balancing those roles 
forging a marriage that will last for a very long time without 
sacrificing the integrity of either 
chances are excellent that whether geiger or wilson is elected 
her legacy will endure its all been part of her plan one of the 
reasons she moved more slowly than she would have liked taking the 
time to educate and persuade and convert her members to each new 
idea 
i wanted to make sure that when i walk away on aug 31 that 
change is in place that the changes weve made will have roots 
says futrell if you agitate people and encourage them to be part 
of it then they have ownership and they will implement those 
changes when youre long gone

when mary hatwood futrell became president of 
the national education association she often found herself 
overshadowed by albert shanker the longtime president of the rival 
american federation of teachers 
i would make a statement and it was like you made a statement 
half an hour later shanker would come back and say the same thing 
and people acted like he was a guru she said he is the aft it 
is like a cult 
futrell says she learned not to compete with shanker a 
philosopher and provocateur with a knack for grabbing headlines and 
instead to talk and react from a teachers perspective now a lot 
of those people have come to respect and appreciate me she said 
the aft which claims about 700000 members to the neas 2 
million embraced the education reform movement from the start 
while the lumbering nea edged onto the bandwagon late and largely 
due to prodding by futrell 
the two union leaders had some really bad clashes at the 
beginning futrell said shanker the aft president since 1974 
now calls them the usual clashes of two rival organizations trying 
to pick up members 
now futrell says we get along fine both insist the other

the house ways and means committee has voted in 
favor of making permanent a system of us trade preferences for 
caribbean nations and to extend the program to textiles 
the liberalization of the reaganera caribbean basin initiative 
also would establish a guaranteed minimum floor for us imports of 
sugar from the region at present quota levels 
some committee members expressed concern tuesday that the bill 
could work to the disadvantage of australia and other 
sugarexporting nations rep sam gibbons dfla chairman of the 
ways and means trade subcommittee said nothing in the measure would 
alter present sugar quotas from countries outside the caribbean 
since the caribbean basin initiative was enacted in 1983 to help 
lift the economy of the region it has allowed dutyfree import of a 
variety of caribbean exports but it specifically exempts several 
major categories especially textiles 
the caribbean basin initiative expansion approved by the 
committee removes the exception for textiles and apparel it would 
permit dutyfree imports of fabric and clothing made from materials 
deemed to be in short supply in the united states and of textiles 
from usmade and cut fabrics that are sewn in the caribbean 
the new legislation would mean us buyers would no longer have 
to pay an 81 percent tariff on clothes imported from the caribbean 
rep ed jenkins dga sought unsuccessfully to eliminate from 
the bill most of the concessions toward caribbean apparel this 
bill is a direct attack on the textile workers he said 
jenkins amendment would have required that any increase in 
caribbean textiles be offset by reductions in imports allowed from 
asia

abc radio network officials say a special program 
on abortion hosted by barbara walters will run today even though 
national advertisers refused to buy time on the program 
the 54minute special airs starting at 206 pm edt on about 144 
radio stations across the country abc said 
lou severine senior vice president of sales for the network 
said tuesday that he was able to find only one buyer abcs 
2020 television show which also features ms walters for one 
minute of the six minutes that were allocated for national ads 
he said advertisers are scared to death of the abortion topic 
they just dont want to be involved with any controversy 
but philip giordano senior vice president at the radio network 
said the program was so important to the networks objectives of 
providing timely programs on compelling topics that abc was prepared 
to absorb all of the costs of producing the show the costs can run 
to 12000 he said 
it is the latest example of advertisers backing way from programs 
that have either offended or risk offending individuals or groups 
who have become increasingly vocal in complaining about 
controversial subjects on radio and tv 
the nbc television network for instance had to cut prices to 
find buyers for ad time on the madefortv movie roe vs wade 
which ran last month and dealt with the case that led to the supreme 
courts 1973 decision that legalized abortion 
advertisers have backed out of shows such as nbcs saturday 
night live and the fox television networks married with 
children after individuals or groups complained that they were 
offended by sexual references or profanity in the shows 
the abc television network cancelled two realitybased shows 
earlier this year because no advertisers signed up 
but jim farley executive producer of todays radio special on 
abortion said no one has called for a boycott because of the topic 
this is different this is the news it will be a 
straightforward fair and balanced discussion of the issues 
farley said 
the show will feature ms walters as moderator of a panel that 
will include two people from each side of the abortion question 
listeners can call in with comments 
severine would not identify any of the national sponsors refusing 
to buy time he said the unfilled national ad time will be used for 
public service announcements such as antidrug or anticrime 
messages 
the time was being offered at a rate of 6000 per minute he 
said no effort was made to reduce the price to attract sponsors 
it was never really the money severine said 
giordano said stations in 21 of the nations 25 biggest radio 
markets have agreed to carry the special which should attract an 
audience of 11 million adults 
he said there were some local stations that were reluctant about 
carrying the program because of the topic and others didnt like 
giving up midday programming time although they get to sell eight 
minutes of local ad time in the show 
one of the stations planning to carry it is koa in denver whose 
manager of operations larry crandall applauded abcs efforts and 
said his station plans its own twohour discussion on the issue 
moderated by a prominent psychologist immediately after the abc 
special 
he said koa expects to fill its ad time on the special with 
previouslypurchased advertising commitments 
the show is the first in what abc radio says will be a series of 
american agenda radio specials hosted by abcs top tv news figures 
including abc anchorman peter jennings and newsman ted koppel 
im certain that as we continue this series that it will get 
wider acceptance giordano said the next program is tentatively 
set for august and will deal with juvenile crime

mccaw cellular communications inc said it was 
disappointed that the lin broadcasting corp board rejected as 
inadequate its 585 billion takeover bid but said it is willing to 
discuss the offer 
we remain confident that our 120pershare price is full and 
fair wayne m perry mccaws vice chairman said in a letter 
tuesday to donald a pels chairman and president of lin 
broadcasting of new york 
the deal would be the biggest to date in the emerging cellular 
telephone business and would extend mccaws reach as the industry 
leader 
cellular franchises have become increasingly lucrative as 
improvements in technology have boosted customer demand for mobile 
phones 
lin which has interests in cellular telephones television and 
publishing said in disclosing its boards decision tuesday that it 
was exploring alternatives including staying independent 
recapitalizing or selling itself to other potential buyers 
mccaws perry noting lins apparent willingness to talk to 
potential suitors said he hoped lin would make available to mccaw 
any nonpublic information that it shares with others 
as we have previously stated we are genuinely ready and 
willing to meet with you to discuss our offer he wrote 
in national overthecounter trading lin rose 262 a share to 
12562 on tuesday while mccaw rose 75 cents a share to 4150 
analysts said they suspected kirkland washbased mccaw would 
eventually sweeten its bid 
mccaw wants lin badly and will make counteroffers said 
kenneth leon a telecommunications analyst for the investment firm 
bear stearns amp co 
among those rumored to be interested in lin have been the 
regional bell telephone companies although some analysts have said 
it is unlikely any one of them could afford the earnings dilution 
that would result from buying lin 
for any one bell company to buy all of lin would be 
considerable dilution and these companies have promised 6 percent to 
7 percent to 8 percent earnings growth said geoffrey johnson 
telecomunications analyst for argus research 
a bid for lin could drag down earnings for years as the debt 
associated with making the acquisition would have to be repaid he 
said 
if a bell company were to get involved with lin johnson said it 
was more likely that the bell company would buy a partial stake in 
lin 
lin said its board decided unanimously that the unsolicited offer 
from mccaw was inadequate and not in the best interests of the 
company or its stockholders 
in an effort to increase share value lin said the company 
intends to pursue its previously announced plan to spin off its 
seven tv broadcasting stations into a new subsidiary 
it also said it was studying steps to make sure its shareholders 
would realize the extra value that would be created if lin prevails 
in its legal fight with metromedia inc over the right to buy 
metromedias interests in cellular systems in philadelphia and new 
york 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission lin said 
some industry analysts have estimated a victory for lin in that case 
would boost its stock value by 40 a share 
lin also said in the sec filing that it had contacted potential 
buyers and had met with them it did not identify any of the 
potential buyers but said they included some that have initiated 
preliminary contacts in the past 
bear stearns leon said lin and its financial advisers had done 
a brilliant job of getting investors excited and confusing them on 
what they are offering in the latest filings 
there is very slim chance that anyone would top mccaw he 
said 
analysts have valued mccaws bid at as much as 290 per potential 
cellular phone customer or twice the 145 per potential customer 
price that british telecommunications plc agreed to pay earlier this 
year for a 20 percent stake in mccaw 
mccaw and british telecom announced separately tuesday that they 
had concluded the deal under which a british telecom subsidiary paid 
137 billion for the stake in mccaw 
lins interests include cellular systems serving new york los 
angeles philadelphia dallas and houston its seven tv stations are 
networkaffiliates and it owns a specialty publishing house that 
provides hardcover tourist guides often available in hotel rooms 
mccaw has major cellular franchises serving customers in seattle 
san francisco miami denver minneapolis and portland ore

alfred checchi who expects to meet this week 
with transportation secretary samuel skinner about his proposed 4 
billion acquisition of northwest airlines says fears about debt in 
the deal are almost laughable 
the amount of debt in this proposal is not the least bit 
excessive checchi said tuesday the hardest part of my day was 
turning down all the banks that want to be part of this credit 
checchis investment group wings holdings inc signed a deal 
monday to acquire northwest parent nwa inc for 121 a share in 
cash the financing includes 700 million in equity and 335 
billion borrowed from a syndicate of commercial banks 
skinner wrote a letter may 15 to nwa chairman steven rothmeier 
saying the department was concerned about any acquisition that would 
have a substantial adverse impact on the companys financial 
structure checchi said he expects to meet with skinner today or 
thursday in washington dc 
to complete a transaction by the sept 18 deadline imposed by 
nwa wings needs a license from the transportation department which 
will examine the financial package to determine whether the group is 
financially fit to safely operate the nations fourthlargest 
airline 
similar reviews have ranged in length from two months for an 
extensive fitness check last year of eastern and continental 
airlines to a sixmonth examination of trans world airlines that 
ended earlier this year a department spokesman said 
people who are sophisticated in the area of corporate finance 
theyre going to find that its almost laughable that people are 
bringing this up as a concern checchi said but certainly its 
understandable 
but concern about debt in the checchi deal prompted standard amp 
poors corp to annouce tuesday that the buyout would likely result 
in a lower rating on nwas senior debt 
the acquisition would raise total debt at nwa to 37 billion 
from 945 million second only to texas air corp among airlines 
standard amp poors said the added annual interest expense of about 
300 million would consume most pretax earnings and almost cut 
operating cash flow in half the creditrating agency said 
it also said nwas weakened financial strength would make the 
carriers plans for fleet modernization more expensive under the los 
angeles investor 
checchi said standard amp poors has not seen the details of his 
groups deal whats more important he said is that bankers are 
lining up to get a piece of it 
despite skepticism guy cook president of the machinists union 
district lodge 143 emerged tuesday from a meeting with checchi 
confident that the airline could carry through its plan to double in 
size in the next five years 
i think its probable at this point that we can establish 
that said cook who heads a 20000member union the airlines 
largest 
not as confident were leaders of the 5000member northwest 
pilots union who also met with checchi on tuesday 
basically he said he feels that debt is his expertise and he 
only talked about it in general terms said jim halvorson a 
spokesman for the air line pilots association unit he said all 
the things youd expect him to say he told us not to worry 
the pilots who have an open contract and have threatened to 
strike if they dont receive competitive wages and job security 
have said checchis deal would add debt that would be troublesome in 
an economic downturn and possibly lead to layoffs 
but checchi said his groups financing package is strong enough 
to carry the company through a recession as severe as the 198081 
downturn 
i would not enter any kind of transaction where the downside 
was not provided for he said 
checchi promised to provide pilots with details of his financing 
package later in the week halvorson said 
halvorson said checchi made a friendly gesture by saying he would 
consider giving northwest employees a stake in the company 
checchi 41 said the concept proved popular at other companies 
where he has worked including marriott corp but he said he wont 
discuss the measure until the pilots settle on a contract because it 
may be viewed as an attempt at gaining employee concessions 
cheechi said he hopes to close the deal within about four weeks 
after the 121ashare tender offer is launched friday

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo spoke with 
confidence about eastern airlines future as he personally assured 
new pilots of a deep commitment to see the carrier succeed despite 
a crippling 3monthold strike 
every day that goes by you see more and more realization of 
what were doing lorenzo told reporters tuesday following 
graduation ceremonies for a group of eastern recruits 
an airline can be rebuilt particularly an airline like 
eastern because of the tremendous strengths and the tremendous 
assets that the company has ive been very encouraged by what ive 
seen 
while eastern a unit of texas air is selling assets to reduce 
its debt lorenzo said the carrier is moving ahead with rebuilding 
and has begun discussions with aircraft manufacturers on buying new 
aircraft for the 1990s 
lorenzo said he thought the federal bankruptcy court overseeing 
easterns reorganization will approve the airlines plan to rebuild 
at twothirds its prestrike size 
he called the plan very very reasonable a much more 
practical solution than the unions call for a new owner or the 
leanings of some creditors toward complete liquidation 
you do have creditors who are frustrated and theyd like to get 
their money lorenzo said we intend to make sure the company 
honors its contracts and provides the creditors what theyre due 
he called the unionbacked buyout effort by chicago commodities 
trader joseph ritchie a joke and said there were no legitimate 
buyers for eastern as a whole 
eastern has been overwhelmed by the interest in most of these 
assets its offering for sale but he declined to discuss pending 
transactions 
earlier lorenzo eastern president phil bakes and other 
executives were all smiles as they handed out diplomas and 
congratulations to 18 eastern pilot recruits who completed training 
we are very very committed to the success of eastern 
airlines lorenzo told them 
company spokesman robin matell said eastern has graduated 108 new 
pilots since it began seeking recruits about a month after the 
strike began march 4 he said there were 259 pilots who crossed the 
picket lines not including 17 more veteran pilots who have told the 
company in the past week that they wish to return to work there are 
527 recruits in training he said 
matell said eastern is well on track toward having enough pilots 
to carry out the airlines planned schedule expansion this summer 
a spokesman for the air line pilots association disputed that 
claim 
were not contradicting the statement in itself said the 
spokesman who asked not to be identified but by numbers and by 
their own information they are going to be able to fly the first 
days of the schedule but theyre not going to be able to continue 
to fly it due to lack of pilots 
eastern also announced tuesday it will lease an a300 airbus jet 
to viasa venezuelan international airways for 14 million over 
four months 
its consistent with our announced business plan to make 18 
billion in assets transactions and use more than 900 million to pay 
down debt matell said 
eastern is about 25 billion in debt earlier this month its 
northeastern shuttle service was handed over to new york developer 
donald trump for 365 million 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days 
after its pilots and flight attendants unions joined a machinists 
union strike that crippled the airline 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland in new york must approve 
any asset sales he approved the shuttle deal and the 2775 million 
sale last week of 15 planes and six aircraft engines to a company 
that buys and resells airplane equipment 
eastern last week announced a deal to sell eight philadelphia 
airport gates 16 jets and other assets to midway airlines for 
2065 million lifland must approve that transaction and eastern 
unions say they will challenge it

yutaka nakamura a daiwa bank trader said the currency stayed 
just below 145 yen most of the day

the yen as it rose against the major european currencies nakamura

the bank of japan sold an estimated 200 million in efforts to 
curb the us currencys rise but it did not have much impact on

highest level in almost two years it then lost 625 yen on friday 
meanwhile the nikkei lost more than 1100 points during the week

some of most economically depressed rural areas 
of the country may be left out of a key part of legislation promoted 
by the chairman of the senate agriculture committee say officials 
of local development commissions 
the bill sponsored by sen patrick leahy dvt would provide 
300 million to start a revolvng loan fund but requires local 
matching funds for communities to receive any of the money 
its ok to an extent but when you get into the hardest hit 
rural areas the reason theres no economic development there in the 
first place is because they cant afford it vernon d martin 
executive director of the planning and development commission in 
brunswick ga said tuesday 
george alford executive director of the alabamatombigbee 
regional commission in camden ala said he is disappointed the 
bill does not link the local match requirement to each communitys 
ability to pay 
alford said his agency cant use existing federal economic 
development revolving loan funds because most of the communities the 
agency serves dont have the resources for the local match 
the only exception to the matching fund requirement would be for 
communities with per capita income that is less than 70 percent of 
the national average then only a 50 percent local match would be 
required 
kaye braaten of the national association of counties said her 
group is happy the bill requires applicants for revolving loans to 
notify county governments and work with state regional and local 
governments in investment strategies 
but she said her organization is disappointed that there is 
little funding for infrastructure 
this is clearly the no 1 need in rural counties she said 
adding that her group hopes more money will be forthcoming to 
rebuild rural roads and bridges 
martin alford and braaten were among dozens of local economic 
development officials from across the country at a news conference 
arranged by leahy to tout the bill he calls landmark legislation 
other key provisions of the bill would set up satellite 
educational and health communication systems and provide funds for 
improving drinking water 
despite their complaints about the local match requirements both 
martin and alford said leahys legislation would provide a needed 
shot in the arm to rural america 
they said they hope to persuade the house or the housesenate 
conference committee that will work out final details of the bill to 
ease the local match requirements for distressed rural areas 
leahy said he expects the measure to be approved by the full 
senate next month and would like to see it used as a model for the 
house 
rep glenn english dokla whose house agriculture subcommittee 
on conservation credit and rural development is working on its own 
bill said he had seen a version of the leahy measure 
there are some good points about that legislation and i think 
it is fine as far as it goes english said i dont think 
legislation drawn up by any one house is going to be the best 
approach to all the problems in rural america 
englishs subcommittee is half through a lengthy series of 
hearings in washington and will hold more in august in five regions 
of the country 
he said legislation will be crafted after all the witnesses have 
spoken probably early fall 
he said a bill could be passed by the house by december but his 
goal is sometime this session which doesnt end until december 1990

a united auto workers dissident group lost 
a third key battle at the unions constitutional convention but 
despite the outcome the groups leader says he is happy with the 
way it went 
about 2000 delegates to the uaws constitutional convention 
turned back an attempt tuesday by the new directions movement to 
limit japanesestyle labormanagement programs on factory floors 
the decision came on two showofhands votes in which no more 
than 20 percent of the delegates supported the new directions effort 
today delegates are scheduled elect top national and regional 
officers uaw president owen bieber faces no opposition to a third 
threeyear term the convention also will elect two vice presidents 
to replace retiring vice presidents donald ephlin and marc stepp 
later bieber will assign the vice presidents to head the unions 
various departments including one for each of the big three 
automakers and another with administrative responsibility for 
agricultural implement and aerospace workers covered by the union 
despite the overwhelming loss tuesday new directions leader 
jerry tucker of st louis said he was happy with his troops and 
their reception 
i think it was a good debate he said debate on the floor 
today was healthy 
tucker held out the possibility that there would be more from new 
directions forces especially next year when the uaw plots its 
strategies for negotiations with the big three automakers contracts 
between the uaw and general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp expire sept 14 1990 
tucker said he was pleased with the way bieber handled the 
debate which sometimes got a little rowdy and hoped that delegates 
would take the new directions message back to their locals 
the rank and file will ultimately find ways to express 
themselves he said 
the loss tuesday was the third by new directions forces since the 
convention opened sunday it winds up friday 
during the first two days of the convention new directions 
backers failed in an attempt to require rankandfile referendum 
voting for top national officers instead of a vote by convention 
delegates and lost a credentials fight for seating some delegations 
members of the movement made a loud entrance to the convention 
hall tuesday about 250 delegates and alternates paraded in carrying 
signs and shouting what do we need new directions when do we 
want it right now 
bieber ignored the parade as it passed in front of the stage 
delegate tony torres of local 653 in pontiac mich stood on a 
chair in front of bieber waved a new directions placard and 
shouted we dont have to go to china injustice is right here 
tucker watched the demonstration from the stage when asked how 
it made him feel he said bigger

l william seidman who would become the new 
deposit insurance czar under legislation moving through congress is 
conferring with the bush administration about an idea that would 
enhance his power over the savings and loan bailout 
under the plan seidman chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp would have greater authority than originally 
envisioned by the administration within the resolution trust corp 
a new agency being created to oversee the closing or sale of 
insolvent thrift institutions and of real estate repossessed by the 
sampls 
under bills passed by the house and senate the rtc will be run 
by a board headed by the treasury secretary it would have an 
oversight staff headed by an executive director but as the 
administration envisions the structure most of the work would be 
contracted out presumably to the fdic 
according to an industry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity seidman wants the fdic to report directly to the rtc 
oversight board rather than through a staff working for the board 
ultimate authority would still rest with the rtc board but 
without the separate staff there would be less opportunity for 
administration secondguessing of seidmans agency also the fdic 
not the rtc board in practice would choose which private firms are 
hired for the lucrative job of assisting the government in the huge 
undertaking 
seidman in a telephone interview tuesday declined to say his 
agency is advocating the idea but he described it as worth 
exploring and feasible 
its not our idea it came from a suggestion that the gao the 
congressional general accounting office made we have been talking 
to treasury about it he said 
the rtc under legislation that passed the house last week and 
the senate in april will have the mammoth task of spending 50 
billion in new bailout funds and of handling 300 billion to 500 
billion of bad loans and property that would make it if it were 
private the largest corporation in the united states 
the legislation does not spell out how the rtc will be structured 
beyond the composition of its board and the fact that it must hire a 
chief executive officer it does not define the relationship between 
the fdic and rtc 
however seidman has said he does not want his agency to get 
expanded responsibility without added authority to control the 
conditions and terms under which it does the additional work 
seidman said if the fdic were not given the added authority and 
were simply a contractor of the rtc it would want to pick and 
choose what sampl liquidation work it wanted 
assistant treasury secretary david w mullins said the 
administration has planned all along for the fdic to take the lead 
role in disposing of failed sampls at issue he said is the vigor of 
administration oversight 
no one likes the idea of a fulltime person overseeing them 
but our view is were required to have oversight he said the 
fdic wants as much independence as it can get but theres a 
limit as to what can be done on that

salaried employees of large us 
companies are paying a bigger share of their medical expenses than 
they did five years ago according to a soontobereleased study of 
employee benefits 
the same workers face a wider array of employersponsored savings 
plans and are increasingly being asked to take a more active role 
in designing their own benefits packages 
there is a desire among employers to involve employees more in 
all aspects of benefits said howard levin a partner in hewitt 
associates the suburban chicago consulting firm that conducted the 
survey of 227 major employers 
theres a sense that when employees participate they get 
involved more and have a greater appreciation for their benefits 
levin said tuesday in a telephone interview from his lincolnshire 
office 
the study will be released publicly early next month said hewitt 
spokeswoman jean campbell 
medical plans are paying more catastrophicillness costs but 
employees are paying a larger share of other medical expenses 
researchers discovered 
hewitt found that just 29 percent of the survey respondents 
medical plans covered 100 percent of hospital room and board 
charges compared with 53 percent in 1984 
the more typical practice is for the plan to cover 80 percent of 
hospital charges and require employees to pay 20 percent up to a 
specified maximum usually 2000 or less the plan then kicks in 
and pays 100 percent 
employers also are trying to better manage medical costs by 
encouraging employees to seek second surgical opinions and have 
medical tests done on an outpatient basis 
in 1984 hewitt found that 62 percent of companies surveyed 
offered the same medical coverage for surgery whether or not the 
employee got a second opinion in 1988 only 29 percent of the 
respondents offered the same coverage regardless of whether a second 
opinion was obtained 
costsharing causes people to be more careful consumers of 
healthcare services levin said the employee who has to pay 
for part of any service they use is going to use more discretion 
the survey revealed a dramatic increase from 56 percent in 1984 
to 82 percent in 1988 in the prevalence of employersponsored 
401k plans these optional savings plans usually supplement 
traditional pension plans and offer tax benefits superior to 
individual retirement accounts 
among retirement savings plans the survey found a trend toward 
more investment options such as company stock stockmarket mutual 
funds and guaranteedincome instruments 
levin said retirement savings options have grown in response to 
the changing demographics of the work force which was once composed 
mainly of married men with families but now includes large numbers 
of both sexes married and single some with children some without 
we have a work force with a much broader diversity of needs 
he said some have high retirementincome needs some have 
lowretirement income needs 
in addition to providing a new way for employees to set aside 
money for retirement a 401k plan takes some of the pressure off 
of employers to funnel more dollars into the pension plan no doubt 
about it levin said

a wildcat strike inflamed by two 
shootings spread to more than 35000 miners in appalachia and the 
midwest by today after thousands of miners in illinois kentucky and 
ohio joined the work stoppage 
at least 40 illinois mines reported a total of more than 8000 
miners who failed to show up for work and hundreds more joined the 
walkout in ohio and western kentucky but employees at four small 
kentucky mines returned to work at midnight tuesday after the 
release of three jailed union leaders 
meantime csx transportation inc reported that the railroads 
coal loadings were down about 1000 cars per day because of the 
strike putting 300 workers at least temporarily off the job 
if the strike continues and spreads the jobs of as many as 
2500 employees could be affected said john w snow president 
and chief executive officer of csx transportation headquartered in 
jacksonville fla 
csx spokeswoman suzanne walston estimated the miners strike has 
reduced by by 15 percent the number of cars loaded daily by the 
company 
some union and industry officials had predicted an end to the 
walkouts with the release of the union leaders jailed in virginia 
for their actions in a strike against the lebanon vabased 
pittston coal group inc 
the three were released monday night on tuesday they promised a 
federal judge they would abide by his order banning sitdown 
demonstrations to block coal trucks at pittston plants 
but today more than 200 cars and pickups drove up and down the 
roads in front of the entrances to the plants continuing a convoy 
tactic that resulting in the ticketing of 22 people tuesday for 
impeding traffic 
nearly 1700 united mine workers members walked off their 
pittston jobs in virginia and west virginia on april 5 after working 
more than 14 months without a contract the strike spread to 
pittstons kentucky operations monday idling 200 more umw members 
pittston had dropped out of the bituminous coal operators 
association to negotiate independently 
the unauthorized walkouts began june 12 after a umw rally in 
charleston to protest pittstons action and to protest the fines and 
jail terms assessed union members in virginia 
shootings were reported tuesday in alabama and west virginia 
in sumiton ala assistant police chief steve jacks said a coal 
truck was hit by five bullets he said the driver whom he refused 
to identify was not struck by any of the 22caliber rounds but 
did complain of grittiness in his eyes possibly caused from the 
broken windshield the truck belongs to black and gold trucking an 
independent sumiton company 
jacks said the shooting was strikerelated and police were 
investigating but no arrests had been made 
at this time we are working closely with some union people to 
try to get some tempers down jacks said i think we are making 
some gain and can come to a neutral standoff 
in west virginia where almost twothirds of the wildcat strikers 
are located strikerelated gunshots were reported in mingo county 
but no arrests were made and no one was reported injured 
wildcat strikers also headed to southwest virginia coal fields to 
try to slow pittston coal shipments 
theyve just got the place saturated with people its pretty 
well blocked up said virginia state police lt cf eaton 
one of the freed union leaders marty hudson field commander 
said hes optimistic miners can beat pittston hudson said the 
wildcat strikers fear a pittston victory could set a precedent 
they see what pittston is doing as a threat to their unions 
hudson said if pittston is successful it will directly affect 
their lives 
a union official in illinois said the release of the union 
leaders may help take the steam out of the strike in his state 
thats real helpful to me said kerry emmons the president 
of umw local 1791 which represents 655 wildcat strikers that is 
a step in the right direction in getting my people to work 
wildcat strikes also were being conducted in pennsylvania 
indiana missouri and tennessee

its own 107 billion offer for time a leading magazine publisher 
and cable operator 
time has rejected paramounts bid 
in trading today on the new york stock exchange time was up 3 a 
share to 15550 time had fallen more than 18 a share over the 
past three trading days since it launched its bid for warner and 
rejected paramounts offer 
warner was down 12 cents a share at 5937 at midday while 
paramount was down 75 cents a share at 5862 
in a revision of an earlier suit filed in delaware chancery 
court paramount asked for an order voiding the time tender offer 
and merger agreement with warner 
it also asks for nullification of any vote to elect directors at 
times annual meeting which is scheduled for june 30 among the 
directors up for election are times chairman and chief executive 
j richard munro and its president nicholas j nicholas jr 
time said paramounts allegations in the new complaint were 
without merit and said the amended complaint appears to be 
designed to provide copy for the press rather than to make a case 
before a court 
time stock which was trading at 126 before paramount announced 
its bid june 6 has climbed as high as 18275 during the past two 
weeks 
peter appert an analyst with cj lawrence morgan grenfell 
inc said times stock price could turn around again if the market 
perceives that the advantage in the struggle for time was shifting 
toward paramount 
time stock has fallen because investors believe the odds are 
greater or improving that time is going to succeed with its bid for 
warner and that paramounts bid for time will fail appert said 
but appert said the market had no concrete information or 
developments to support its speculation and it was still widely 
expected that courts in delaware where all three companies are 
incorporated ultimately would decide the outcome of the takeover 
fight 
paramount has bid 175 a share for time which rejected the offer 
and said it would continue to pursue a merger with warner on 
friday time announced it was revising its earlier stockswap merger 
agreement with warner and was launching a 70ashare tender offer 
for the company 
time contends the paramount offer is uncertain because it is 
dependent on obtaining financing and because paramount must obtain 
regulatory approval before it can acquire the franchises to about 
800 cable television systems time owns 
appert said the takeover fight could turn on whether time in 
agreeing to the merger with warner in march effectively put itself 
up for sale if the courts decide that is the case time directors 
could be forced to seek the highest price for the companys stock 
and the paramount bid might then succeed 
wall street in depressing times stock is betting the courts 
will side with time and allow the directors to pursue an acquisition 
of warner 
meanwhile in filings with the federal communications commission 
tuesday warner charged that paramounts bid for time violates the 
1984 cable act and fcc rules and paramount told the commission it 
should set aside a ruling allowing time to transfer control of its 
cable tv systems to timewarner 
paramount said time had misrepresented to its stockholders the 
nature of the transfer and that time had written to state attorneys 
general asking them to oppose paramounts proposal without notifying 
paramount of the letters 
these actions raise questions about times character 
qualifications paramount said asking the fcc to set aside its 
approval of the license transfers pending an investigation 
paramount earlier this month asked the fcc for permission to give 
control of time to former defense secretary donald rumsfeld pending 
fcc approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and 
licenses held by times subsidiary american television and 
communications corp 
art harding a lawyer for warner said tuesday paramounts 
request would violate the recent cable act because rumsfeld hasnt 
gotten consent from any of these cities for the transfers 
harding echoing assertions time made against paramount in a june 
13 fcc filing said paramounts plan would undermine the delicate 
balance established in the 1984 cable act for regulation of cable 
systems by local authorities 
warner asked the fcc late monday to deny the application made by 
paramount and its subsidiary kds acquisition corp for expedited 
consent to transfer control of time to rumsfeld and then to 
paramount 
in a separate development warner cancelled the june 23 
shareholders meeting it had scheduled for a vote on the original 
merger plan with time 
time earlier had rescheduled its june 23 shareholders meeting 
until june 30 and said it would deal with election of directers and 
nothing related to the merger with warner

japanese businessmen cautiously are returning to 
china hoping to resume the business that they long have conducted 
in that market while remaining wary of another outbreak of unrest 
foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka has criticized businessmen for 
returning too quickly saying they invited charges that they are 
trying to make money like a thief at a fire but the government 
has not formally asked firms to refrain from business 
japan has been more cautious in its criticism of china than the 
united states which is pushing for the suspension of all new world 
bank loans to protest the chinese governments bloody suppression of 
prodemocracy demonstrations two weeks ago 
for the time being the japanese government is not considering 
sanctions but is continuing to gather information chief cabinet 
secretary masajuro shiokawa told a news conference wednesday 
nevertheless on tuesday foreign ministry officials said 
negotiations on a new fiveyear 56 billion loan package to china 
were not being conducted but japan would decide whether to resume 
talks after watching the situation in china 
sanctions by japan could be more serious than sanctions by the 
united states because japans trade with china is larger 193 
billion last year and because japan provides 80 percent of chinas 
foreign loans 
prime minister sousuke uno has expressed regret at the chinese 
crackdown but so far has stressed maintaining good longterm ties 
with china he and other officials have cited japans preworld war 
ii invasion of china as a major reason for reluctance to criticize 
the chinese government 
the governments cautious attitude has been criticized as too 
weak by some of the japanese press and some business leaders 
but many businessmen want the government to help smooth 
resumption of business they fear that us economic sanctions could 
harm the general business environment and the suspension of world 
bank loans could hurt chinas ability to conduct trade with japan 
if the united states cut trade ties with china some japanese 
companies might take up the slack said jan vandenberg an 
economist at merrill lynch securities in tokyo however its 
unlikely they would take up the slack in us direct investment in 
china us sanctions would be a disincentive for anyone else to 
invest she said 
the chinese government has been trying to woo foreign businessmen 
back with reassurances that its economic opendoor policy remains 
intact some traders say china even has speeded up the normally 
glacial paperwork required to do business 
japanese traders view these assurances with skepticism but like 
many americans are trying to maintain business ties while carefully 
watching the situation said hiroaki kasahara general manager of 
the china department at marubeni corporation 
major trading houses have sent limited numbers of staff back to 
china to carry out existing contracts and monitor the situation 
said a trader who declined to be named 
trading houses said that even at the height of the unrest 
shipments in and out of china did not stop although there were some 
slowdowns production at a number of jointventure factories far 
from beijing and shanghai were undisturbed by events in the capital 
japanese banks and securities houses do not plan to send staff 
back to china for now while a number of manufacturers plan to 
proceed with plans for joint ventures japan broadcasting 
corporation reported 
kumagai gumi a major construction company said it has not 
resumed work on a 51story beijing building stopped during the 
unrest 
were not sure yet if there are workers and materials 
available said makoto sasaki a company spokesman none of the 
company employees who were evacuated have returned to beijing and it 
is unclear if they will he said 
but yokogawa electric company a major electrical machinery 
manufacturer said its joint venture factory in xian resumed 
production last week following a temporary shutdown during the 
unrest 
half of the japanese chinabased staff have returned to china and 
the company hopes to send the rest back later said tatsuya ando of 
yokogawas public relations office 
we have a very long history in china and we are not 
considering fundamentally rethinking our plans in china just because 
of recent events ando said

grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly 
mixed wednesday on the chicago board of trade with rainy weather 
helping to buoy up wheat prices and depress the corn and soybean 
markets 
rain is slowing the winter wheat harvest in the southeast but 
aiding newly planted corn and soybeans in the midwest scattered 
showers were expected to spread eastward from western iowa over the 
next couple days ending about a week of dry weather in the corn 
belt 
wheat prices fell early in the session on rumors of a possible 
embargo on grain to china but closed higher after us officials 
said they did not plan to cut off grain sales to china to protest 
the executions of prodemocracy dissidents 
but experts said recent chinese purchases of us wheat have 
probably eliminated any immediate need 
i think they can hold back and stay off the market for a few 
months said susan leighty a grainmarket analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 399 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 2 cents lower with july at 265 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 
5 cents lower with july at 163 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with july at 739 a bushel

a georgia frozen food company known mainly 
for its chicken and barbecue is selling its new japanese food in a 
crowded market japan 
but the overseas competition doesnt worry ramph food enterprises 
inc which is exploiting its products cost advantages to carve a 
niche in the market 
its cheaper to produce in america said don hall president 
of savannahbased ramph food our labor is cheaper our costs of 
goods are cheaper and even if you add in the shipping charges its 
still cheaper 
since halls company was established in 1981 it has produced 
chicken and dumplings chicken pot pies pork barbecue and such 
frozen rice dishes such as seafood and catfish gumbos 
in 1987 ramph joined nitto food products ltd a leading japanese 
food manufacturer and nozaki america inc a japanese trading 
company in forming georgia pro foods inc 
nitto sent hideo saga a consultant for a japanese company with 
which ramph markets the usmade frozen dinners to savannah to 
develop test products including beefrice a popular japanese 
dish of rice beef and vegetables 
halls 50 employees ship 80000 pounds of cooked beef a month to 
japan the maximum allowed under a governmentset quota the beef 
cooked and packed in sixpound pouches is used in various nitto 
products 
pro foods also ships 40000 pounds of frozen beefrice a month 
packed in plastic pouches that can be heated in boiling water or 
microwave ovens 
to assure the authenticity of the dish the rice is steamed in a 
japanese rice cooker resembling a large safe complete with a wheel 
to bolt it shut another japanese machine keeps the beef slices to a 
thickness of between 15 and 25 millimeters a tolerance specified 
by nitto 
a third japanese machine known as a nitrogen tunnel cools the 
beefrice pouches to minus10 degrees fahrenheit the blast of 
nitrogen keeps the rice from clumping when heated and served 
we send it to small restaurants and cafeterias the people in 
the back know it was made in savannah ga but not the customers 
said saga 
saga who spent six years developing frozen and canned foods in 
nittos yamagata headquarters has been assigned permanently to 
savannah he is one of two japanese quality control consultants at 
pro foods nitto sends a new assistant every three months 
japanese consumers eat rice about three times a day but have to 
pay about five times more than their american counterparts said 
saga to protect growers the japanese government bars imports of 
cheaper foreign rice but permits foods containing rice 
beef the secondmost popular meat in japan after fish must be 
imported because the japanese cannot produce enough to meet demand 
said hall as a result the wholesale price of beef is 8 to 12 a 
pound in japan compared to about 350 a pound for prime filet 
mignon at american grocery stores he said 
saga is developing additional products for pro foods to export 
his countrymen like italian food but probably would not enjoy chili 
and tacos he said 
saga also doesnt see a future for halls catfish gumbo because 
in japanese mythology catfish are thought to cause earthquakes 
there are many catfish in japan but they are never eaten 
saga said 
hall believes there are many untapped opportunities for small 
companies such as ramph that want to sell to the japanese but the 
firms will have to supply products that meet their needs and 
specifications 
the future is in small ventures hall said there are 124 
million japanese living in an area the size of california they all 
eat they all sleep and they all drink the items that can be 
manufactured here to japanese specifications are just unlimited

ah robins co and american home products corp 
announced wednesday that they have moved back to dec 31 the 
deadline for american home products to buy the richmondbased 
pharmaceutical company 
under the orginal purchase agreement american home products 
could terminate the purchase and withdraw from the chapter 11 
reorganization of robins if all appeals of the plan were not cleared 
up by july 26 american home products is purchasing robins through a 
700 million stock swap 
last week the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond 
affirmed a lower court ruling approving the reorganization plan 
part of the plan includes a 25 billion trust fund to pay off the 
claims of nearly 200000 women who claimed physical injury from the 
use of the robins dalkon shield intrauterine birth control device 
both american home products chairman john r stafford and e 
claiborne robins jr president and chief executive officer of the 
pharmaceutical company said the extension of the termination date 
would allow sufficient time for any appeals of the appeals court 
decision 
we would like to get on with the completion of our acquisition 
of ah robins stafford said we believe doing so promptly 
would be in the best interests of all concerned if no appeals of 
the orders are taken to the supreme court our present 
anticipation is that the transaction will be complete early in the 
fourth quarter of this year 
robins sought federal bankruptcy protection in 1985 in the wake 
of mounting claims from the use of the dalkon shield marketed by 
the company in the mid1970s women who used the iud said they 
suffered injuries ranging from internal bleeding to sterility 
after three years of hearings the reorganization plan was 
approved by federal district judge robert r merhige jr and later 
by robins creditors that approval was challenged by attorneys 
representing some of the claimants who argued votes from women who 
claimed the greatest injury should be given a greater weight than 
other claimants

hooker corp an australian property developer and retailing 
concern hopes it can quickly accomplish a plan to sell stakes in 
its american stores and sell shopping malls it owns in the united 
states a hooker executive said wednesday 
j frank haasbeek president of lj hooker corp the 
atlantabased holding company for hookers us operations said 
hooker wants to act swiftly in arranging the sales which are aimed 
at lightening the companys debt load 
we would like to accomplish a lot in the next three to six 
months haasbeek said in an interview 
hooker announced earlier this week that it is seeking joint 
venture partners to invest in its bonwit teller department store 
chain b altman stores sakowitz and parisian stores 
the merksamer jewelers chain which is 80 percent owned by 
hooker has been put on the sale block by hooker and the other 
owners 
hooker also said it will divest its forest fair mall in 
cincinnati richland fashion mall in columbia sc and thornton 
town center outside denver in addition partners are being sought 
to invest in malls hooker plans to build in cary nc tampa fla 
and atlanta 
a 20story office tower hooker has under construction in midtown 
atlanta called 10 peachtree also will be sold 
haasbeek declined to identify parties that have expressed 
interest in investing in hookers department stores or buying the 
shopping malls 
he said the malls have attracted many potential purchasers and 
hooker is negotiating with a north american builder about making an 
investment in the sites on which hooker plans to construct new 
shopping malls 
announcement of the planned sales followed word from sydney 
australiabased hooker in late may that it intended to sell 750 
million of holdings in the united states and australia to raise 
badly needed cash 
much of hookers financial difficulty stems from three years of 
rapid expansion in us retailing and real estate development a 
recent slowdown in us retail sales a sharp rise in australian 
interest rates and tightened credit 
since 1986 hooker has acquired bonwit teller and b altman 
department stores located in the northeast and florida 80 percent 
of sakowitz a small chain of department stores based in houston a 
majority interest in parisian a chain operating in the south based 
in birmingham ala and 80 percent of merksamer jewelers a string 
of jewellery stores with headquarters in sacramento calif 
at a meeting in sydney on wednesday hooker asked about 40 
creditor banks to support a fourmonth moratorium on principal 
payments on its loans hooker would pay only interest during the 
period 
the lenders were asked to decide by friday whether they would 
agree to the temporary reprieve for hooker 
after wednesdays meeting richard grellman of the accounting 
firm peat marwick hungerfords an adviser to hooker said there is 
a general level of support for the moratorium proposal among 
hookers creditors 
if the creditors go along with a postponement in principal 
payments hooker will draw up a restructuring plan within three 
months for approval by the lenders 
grellman said hookers directors remain in charge of running 
operations and all hookers businesses continue to be operated as 
usual

would wound the freewheeling british colony that becomes part of 
communist china eight years from now 
chan predicted any wounds would heal but admitted uncertainty 
about what looms ahead 
those were very sad events indeed chan told reporters in new 
york during a visit that followed the chinese governments crackdown 
on a prodemocracy movement it is time to be humble about our 
lack of knowledge about what is going on in china 
for the frenetic territory of free enterprise that sits like a 
fragile egg along the southern chinese frontier the bloodletting 
fractured a veneer of confidence that china will permit hong kong to 
maintain its way of life for 50 years after the 1997 takeover as 
promised under a historic sinobritish pact 
the june 34 killings and their aftermath devastated prices in 
the hong kong stock market weakened property values led to record 
requests for emigration visas and drained bank vaults as many 
depositors spirited their money abroad fearing more turmoil 
even hong kong optimists began to quietly question whether 
britain made a grave mistake five years ago by agreeing to surrender 
the colony a vestige of the opium war days that has since blossomed 
into one of the most fabulously successful industrial and financial 
centers of asia 
for chan a 46yearold nativeborn hong kong chinese who speaks 
flawless britishaccented english the beijing crackdown and its 
impact on the colony have presented the greatest challenge of his 
career and personal life 
chan must try to convince americans and other foreigners with 
billions of dollars invested in hong kong that their money and 
property not only are safe but will grow in value in the 
pretakeover years and beyond 
he also must try to persuade hong kongs 6 million people to 
hope to trust that china will honor its pledge to basically leave 
them alone after the scarlet hammer amp sickle flag replaces britains 
union jack on july 1 1997 the official termination of british 
authority under their joint declaration 
what gives the sinobritish agreement its teeth is that its a 
binding agreement chan said during his trip earlier this month to 
washington and new york where he expounded on the virtues of hong 
kongs economy to lawmakers and business groups and rejected 
suggestions that the territory is doomed 
china has an excellent track record of honoring its 
international commitments he said even in the dark days of the 
cultural revolution the chinese honored their agreements they kept 
hong kong supplied with food and water 
in his view china not only will protect hong kongs way of life 
but will continue exhorting its entrepreneurs to share their 
expertise with the rest of the country 
chan is a senior native hong kong member of the british 
administration and has been a career colonial official for the past 
25 years with posts that have ranged from government spokesman to 
the governors private secretary 
perhaps for that reason chan has no choice but to put the best 
face on a potentially explosive problem and has gone out of his way 
to show he wants to stay in hong kong whether he really believes in 
its future or not 
he was deeply involved in the negotiations that climaxed with the 
sinobritish agreement in 1984 and is a member of the sinobritish 
land commission a body established under the agreement to oversee 
the sale and allocation of property in the years up to 1997 
in march 1987 he became deputy chief secretary and was 
responsible for formulating constitutional reforms aimed at giving 
hong kong a democratically elected government prior to the chinese 
takeover he became trade and industry secretary this past march 
his responsibilities now include hong kongs international 
trading relations and its involvement in world commercial 
organizations such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
unlike his british colleagues however chan does not have a 
british passport or right of residence in britain he grew up and 
went to school in hong kong he lives there with his wife and two 
children he just purchased an apartment in hong kong and said he 
does not keep any overseas bank accounts 
my family and i remain committed to hong kong he said i 
was born here my father was born here 
hong kong he said is not china it is not going to be run by 
china it will be run by hong kong people under the agreement 
nonetheless events in china over the past few weeks have jolted 
many other hong kong people into concluding that the beijing 
government has no regard for international opinion when confronted 
with a threat to its political supremacy in their view if hong 
kong eventually is seen by the chinese communist party as a 
destabilizing influence on the rest of the country it would use 
whatever means necessary to fortify itself at hong kongs expense 
this scenario strikes the deepest fear into the hong kong 
government because it raises the possibility of chaos many hong 
kong residents are refugees of past chinese political convulsions 
and now have no place to go britain has made no special 
arrangements to accept them 
for that reason chan and other members of hong kongs colonial 
administration recently began to press london to reconsider its 
immigration policy concerning hong kong residents 
britain has a moral obligation to the people of hong kong 
chan said they want to acquire an insurance policy a home of 
last resort if things really turn bad 
the lukewarm response of the british thus far chan said 
indicates this is not an easy matter for them 
chan admitted he is not a trained sinologist and the stunning 
crackdown on political dissidents in china took him by surprise 
nonetheless chan said if it had to happen he was grateful it 
happened in 1989 not 1996 
one of the silver linings on this dark cloud is that its given 
hong kong people a hard shock like an injection an immunization 
against the next rude shock he said 
as for his own future under the chinese communist umbrella chan 
smiled philosophically 
if i do well in the next eight years he said maybe ill 
get a promotion

a former new york federal reserve bank board 
member pleaded guilty wednesday to illegally passing on confidential 
interest rate data in the first insider trading case involving 
government securities 
in a plea agreement robert a rough 50 pleaded guilty to a 
single bank fraud charge and the government in exchange dropped two 
insider trading charges and four related counts 
rough admitted leaking confidential data while he served as a new 
york fed board member from 1982 to 1984 to a securities firm that 
made about 50 million from the information 
as part of the plea deal prosecutors also agreed to recommend a 
prison term of under one year for the former banker rough faces a 
maximum five years in jail and 10000 fine sentencing is set for 
aug 18 
roughs attorney michael himmel said his client had sent 
letters of apology to the new york fed and federal reserve bank in 
washington 
to me its certainly a step in the right direction an example 
of contrition himmel said 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise called the apologies a 
good step 
rough admitted giving a livingston brokerage confidential data 
about the discount rate set by the fed in washington the new york 
fed and 11 sister regional banks make regular recommendations to the 
fed on the rate which has a powerful bearing on government 
securities 
rough sat on the new york feds board as president of the 
national bank of sussex county in branchville he admitted leaking 
recommendations as well as advance word of a change in the feds 
discount rate 
the allegations surfaced during the 1987 trial of a gilbert c 
schulman president of the brokerage firm of bevill bresler amp 
schulman inc he and three other bevill bresler officials were 
imprisoned for the firms 144 million collapse in 1985 
rough admitted that he passed on the data to schulman a longtime 
friend and business associate and other principals 
the government said the information allowed the firm to make an 
estimated 50 million in profits and avoid losses in exchange 
rough allegedly received 47000 in interest deferred loans 
after the charges were disclosed the fed tightened its 
procedures regarding the discount rate 
himmel said roughs disclosures were not done out of any 
motivation for greed or to line his pockets and blamed pumping 
and prodding by gilbert schulman 
he claimed rough probably would have received the loans from 
bevill bresler regardless of whether he provided the information 
schulman had agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of rough 
himmel said rough a former chairman of the new jersey bankers 
association admitted the facts outlined in those charges even 
though he was not required to plead guilty to them 
in pretrial arguments himmel argued the discount rate data had 
no inherent material value and was not comparable to information 
about stocks but debevoise disagreed ruling that insider trading 
laws could apply to roughs case 
the insider trading charges would have carried a fine of 100000 
per count

when ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
triumphantly led iran through a revolution a decade ago oil output 
tumbled world prices soared and shock waves hurt the us economy 
but analysts say that with the spiritual leaders death earlier this 
month history wont repeat itself 
its business as usual said peter gignoux director of the 
international energy department at shearson lehman hutton brokerage 
in london 
fergus macleod analyst at londons barclays de zoete wedd said 
in the shortterm the impact will be extremely limited 
with the quick transfer of power to president ere 
have so far been no reports of instability that would threaten the 
flow of crude from one ali khamenei thof the worlds major producing nations 
there doesnt appear to be any civil disruptions which could 
unsettle the oil sector said paul mlotok head of energy research 
at morgan stanley amp co in new york 
the 1979 revolution which brought khomeini to power and ended 
the reign of shah mohammad reza pahlavi was marked by unrest in the 
oilfields and a sharp drop in production world oil prices soared 
roiling the economies of the united states and other indus recently that 
iran could produce 35 million 
barrels a day without any problem 
we want to keep onshore and offshore production capacity for 
the next five years at a level of 4 million barrels a day he said 
repairing its damaged industry would boost the slumping economy 
iran earned an estimated 9 billion last year from oil revenues 
compared with 236 billion in 1977 
with increased production and higher prices 1989 earnings should 
climb to about 12 billion analysts predict

the resignation of federal reserve board member h robert heller 
sparked strong rallies in the gold silver and platinum markets 
wednesday amid uncertainty about his departures impact on interest 
rates and inflation 
on other markets copper futures plummeted cotton and heating 
oil surged pork bellies plunged and grains and soybeans were mixed 
gold futures prices rose 610 to 690 on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in august at 37570 a troy 
ounce silver settled 47 cents to 51 cents higher with july at 
5298 a troy ounce 
platinum finished 690 to 770 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with july at 50180 a troy ounce the 
contracts first close above 500 since june 8 
the news that heller was leaving the fed to join the creditcard 
company visa international triggered heavy buying during the last 10 
minutes of trading on all the preciousmetals markets which benefit 
from inflation worries 
the federal reserves attempts to fight inflation by raising 
interest rates have generally been seen as effective the propects 
of a change in the boards composition sent a buying panic through 
the preciousmetals markets which were already trading higher in 
reaction to a continued weakening of the dollars value against 
other major currencies 
hellers resignation while not likely to change the feds 
course adds to the murkiness of recent economic indicators 
there are a lot of crosscurrents out there and people are very 
uncertain about what is being said by the markets said sharon 
ziemian a preciousmetals analyst with citibank in new york 
analyst nina lipton of the platinum guild international a 
platinum trade association said platinums close above 500 an 
ounce signaled a real turning point for all the precious metals 
which had been trending lower since late last year 
but stephen platt of dean witter reynolds inc in chicago saw no 
such signs in the gold market 
the market is not showing any sort of independent strength 
he said 
copper futures plummeted on the commodity exchange following news 
that the canadian copper refiner noranda minerals had reached a new 
labor agreement with workers 
major us copper producers are also negotiating new labor 
contracts and the noranda settlement might portend easier going for 
those talks platt said 
copper settled 62 cents to 8 cents lower with june at 1077 a 
pound 
some cotton futures soared the 2 centsapound daily limit on the 
new york cotton exchange amid fears that persistent rain in the 
southeast was hampering planting and care of the crop 
cotton settled 93 cent to 2 cents higher with july at 6880 
cents a pound 
heating oil futures skyrocketed on the new york merc partly on a 
weekly american petroleum institute report that showed us stocks 
of petroleum distillates had dropped by 16 million barrels last 
week 
heating oil settled 183 cents to 229 cents higher with july at 
4798 cents a gallon west texas intermediate crude oil was 39 cents 
to 45 cents higher with august at 1931 a barrel unleaded gasoline 
was 07 cent lower to 106 cents higher with july at 5910 cents a 
gallon 
frozen pork belly futures fell sharply on the chicago mercantile 
exchange in line with weaker cash prices which helped to drag down 
the related livestock markets 
frozen pork bellies settled 60 cent to 98 cent lower with july 
at 3352 cents a pound hogs were 12 cent lower to 17 cent higher 
with july at 4907 cents a pound live cattle were 20 cent to 60 
cent lower with august at 7012 cents a pound feeder cattle were 
42 cent lower to 10 cent higher with august at 81 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago 
board of trade with rainy weather helping to support wheat prices 
and depress the corn and soybean markets 
wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher with july at 399 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with july at 265 a

the champagne and string quartet are gone from 
the busy terminal at laguardia airport and even donald trump cant 
master the weather to make the flights run on time for his newly 
acquired northeast shuttle airline 
but passengers say they like the service and the trump shuttle 
meets their needs as business travelers for them the frills are 
secondary 
the billionaire developer launched his new airline two weeks ago 
with a blitz of trademark trump glitz soon after a federal 
bankruptcy judge approved his 365 million purchase of the new 
yorkwashingtonboston shuttle from strikebound eastern airlines 
pan am corp which operates a rival shuttle and gained a big 
chunk of business from eastern concedes that curiosity about 
trumps new service has robbed it of some passengers at least for 
a while 
pan ams share of the shuttle market has definitely come down 
as we expected said pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon that share 
was around 75 percent two weeks ago but has slipped since trumps 
startup to 65 percent to 70 percent she estimated 
but trump shuttle president bruce nobles claims a bigger share 
for the new service around 45 percent to 55 percent 
im very pleased with the way the operation is running he 
said wednesday nobles added that he has been disappointed by the 
recent run of unseasonably stormy weather in the northeast which 
has caused many delays and cancellations 
on wednesday the trump shuttle terminal at new yorks laguardia 
airport was back to normal the red and white balloons 
mozartplaying string quartet and buffet tables laden with champagne 
and finger food present for its inaugural day were gone although 
new fresh plants and big red ts remained as permanent touches 
thunderstorms in the northeast snarled the shuttles hourly 
schedule and shattered trumps advertised claim for getting the 
flights off precisely on time the red neon advisory warned of 
runway delays of up to 90 minutes 
passengers on the 7 am edt flight from washingtons national 
airport to laguardia didnt arrive until 1040 am after a detour 
to albany ny for refueling some of the travelers arriving at 
laguardia were exasperated but conceded that the weather is beyond 
even trumps control 
i dont know how eastern would have handled it said a young 
woman traveling on business to mt kisco ny 
on tuesday with good weather flights were running closer to 
schedule although still not always exactly on the hour as promised 
by trump 
the 740 am new yorktowashington run left only five minutes 
late and arrived 10 minutes early while the 5 pm washingtonnew 
york flight left only a few minutes late and arrived on time at 6 
pm 
the service was fine its like any other airline one young 
businessman said wednesday it didnt seem any different to me it 
got me here thats the main thing 
trump has promised his shuttle will be a diamond service but 
a number of passengers indicated they cared more about 
transportation than about trumps planned refurbishing of the jets 
in burgundy and saddlebrown tones with chrome and maple wood veneer 
accents 
on the outside only four of trump shuttles fleet of 21 boeing 
727s have been repainted in the new color scheme white fuselage 
with red black and gold stripes the word trump above the 
stripes and a red t on the tail except for a trump hastily 
painted in red on the rest of the planes they still sport the 
familiar eastern silver and blue 
the food is pretty much the same too on a recent morning flight 
the offering was a bagel a dollop of cream cheese a few grapes a 
strawberry halffrozen orange juice that had to be eaten with a 
spoon and coffee served in paper cups 
evening fare consisted of three pieces of barbecued chicken 
breast corntomato salad and a slice of rye bread in a plastic box 
along with free beer wine and soft drinks 
most of the 1000 or so trump employees were formerly with 
eastern and many of them are enthusiastic and visibly happy to be 
working again after more than three months on the picket line 
its a world of difference said first officer bill bowen an 
18year eastern pilot comparing the two airlines better working 
conditions more flexible management 
a young woman selling tickets at laguardia also a former eastern 
employee said donald trump is a perfectionist and now we get 
our paychecks on time

the government locked the doors of the guardian 
bank of hempstead wednesday morning and federal investigators said 
they would seek evidence of criminal behavior in the banks failure 
while fbi agents executed search warrants to look for evidence of 
fraud 80 staffers from the federal deposit insurance corp began 
the work of liquidating the bank and preparing checks for federally 
insured depositors federal authorities said 
in a related action the government national mortgage association 
ousted new york guardian mortgagee corp from gnmas program of 
mortgagebacked securities 
louis gasper executive vice president of gnma said his agency 
declared the new york guardian in default and took over its 
multibilliondollar portfolio because investors were not being fully 
paid 
gasper said beginning next month investors will be paid in full 
and on time and those shortchanged in the past would be reimbursed 
we believe there will be substantial losses that the government 
will have to make up here and we will do so promptly he said 
us attorney andrew maloney said investigators obtained search 
warrants based on allegations of selfdealing and misuse of bank 
resources they cited transactions made by louis b bernstein 
president of new york guardian and the largest shareholder of 
guardian bank 
maloney said that among the allegations was that bernstein was 
involved in a sham divestiture in which 54 million was improperly 
transferred from new york guardian to mebco bank of geneva the 
swiss bank than lent 5 million to lbb co a company owned by 
bernstein and lbb bought new york guardian and another guardian 
bank subsidiary guardian diversified services inc for 1 million 
alan whitney spokesman for the fdic said an announcement would 
be made in a few days about when checks covering insured deposits 
would be issued to the banks 12000 depositors 
all deposits are insured by the government up to 100000 
customers with accounts of more than 100000 will receive 100000 
and a certificate for the balance that represents a claim against 
whatever assets remain after the bank liquidation whitney said 
the bank was declared insolvent by dean s marriott senior 
deputy comptroller of the office of the comptroller of the currency 
guardian bank came under the scrutiny of the comptrollers office 
in 1984 because of what the government described as deteriorating 
asset quality poor earnings and declining capital 
despite prodding to correct the problems the losses continued 
and the bank went under with assets of 420 million and deposits of 
390 million maloney said 
guardian bank was founded in 1973 as vanguard national bank a 
minorityowned company other stockholders took control in a proxy 
fight in 1976 and in 1979 bernstein bought the bank merged it with 
his mortgage company and changed its name

the leader of a united auto workers union 
dissident group lost a bid wednesday to stay on the unions 
international executive board and the man who defeated him said the 
dissident movement is dying 
jerry tucker director of the st louisbased uaw region 5 lost 
a reelection bid to roy wyse a member of local 249 in kansas city 
mo in sometimesnoisy regional caucus balloting wyse received 
438351 votes and tucker got 233627 
tucker who became a regional director last year in a federally 
supervised election said he had not decided whether to go to court 
to challenge the convention delegate elections that led to 
wednesdays vote 
wyse said delegates from the eightstate region saw through the 
new directions movement they saw they had questions but no answers 
i think its the beginning of the end for the new directions 
movement 
the blow was the latest tuckers forces have received at the 
convention which concluded friday delegates rejected three new 
directionsbacked resolutions at no time did new directions get 
more than an estimated 20 percent in the showofhands votes 
uaw president owen bieber who ran the region 5 caucus and the 
tuckerwyse election said afterward that he was happy with the 
results 
there was a possibility that new directions forces could attempt

time incs cable television arm said wednesday 
that local opposition is growing to paramount communications incs 
plans for acquiring times cable franchises as part of its hostile 
107 billion offer for the media giant 
american television and communications corp which is 82 percent 
owned by time has said paramounts acquisition of time would be 
illegal because the change in control would place atc in violation 
of many of its cable franchise agreements 
it said officials from the states of kansas and hawaii and 16 
cities including denver and charlotte nc have complained to 
federal officials that paramounts takeover plan would abrogate the 
local right of prior approval for cable franchise ownership in their 
areas 
atc said indianapolis mayor william hudnut iii for instance 
told the federal communications commission in a letter that the 
paramounts takeover plan is fundamentally at odds with atcs 
franchise and local laws as well as federal laws on cable regulation 
it said emanuel cleaver ii the mayor pro tem of kansas city 
told the fcc in another letter this intended action by paramount 
unquestionably will violate the express terms of our cable 
television franchise 
atc also said that paramount has indicated in a court filing in 
connecticut where atc is based that it will be unable to meet the 
july 5 deadline it set in its 175ashare tender offer for time 
time had said in rejecting paramounts offer last week that the 
bid was highly conditional and subject to delays 
asked for a response paramount said it intends to extend the 
expiration date of its tender offer until after delaware chancery 
court issues a decision in a suit paramount filed wednesday against 
time both companies are incorporated in delaware 
on the issue of the cable franchises paramount said it expects 
to get cable franchise approval where required by state and local 
law in an orderly and expeditious way 
atc based in stamford conn is the nations secondlargest 
cable operator with about 41 million subscribers
