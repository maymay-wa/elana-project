a state judge on thursday refused to block 
ted bundys fourth date with the electric chair next week 
the 42yearold former law student convicted of three murders and 
suspected of dozens more is scheduled to die at 7 am tuesday at 
the florida state prison floridas supreme court is scheduled to 
hear the case friday 
its time were approaching the 11th anniverary of the 
death of kimberly leach and ted bundy is still alive said state 
attorney jerry blair who prosecuted bundy for the 1978 murder of 
the 12yearold girl bundys last victim 
circuit judge john peach denied bundys claims in an appeal filed 
in this city where bundy abducted the girl 
i think we should have won but well win because his claims 
are valid james coleman one of bundys attorneys 
carolyn snurkowski with the attorney generals office agreed 
with the judges ruling i think he bundy has exhausted the 
final claims that he wants to raise she said 
the appeal was based on three issues bundys competence at the 
time he rejected a plea bargain that would have kept him from the 
electric chair continuing appeals in a separate case in which bundy 
was convicted of murdering two florida state university sorority 
sisters and claims that the trial judge received material from the 
prosecution that the defense didnt know about 
peach heard the arguments after judge wallace m jopling 
disqualified himself at the request of the defense 
jopling had presided over bundys trial in the leach case the 
attorneys said jopling had held conversations with the prosecutors 
and reviewed a psychiatric report on bundy before it was introduced 
into evidence 
gov bob martinez who signed the death warrant for bundy in the 
leach murder said wednesday he will not delay the execution even 
though a lawyer for bundy said he could cooperate with investigators 
on unsolved cases 
bundy whose case was depicted in the television miniseries the 
deliberate stranger has also been sentenced to death for fatally 
bludgeoning the two sorority women in 1978 
before his capture in florida he was on the fbis mostwanted 
list as a suspect in as many as 36 sexrelated murders or 
disappearances of young women in the northwest 
bundy has been granted a stay three times before the last was in 
1986 six hours before his scheduled execution 
a bundy attorney diana weiner on wednesday said bundy was 
committed to revealing all he knew about unsolved murders she 
didnt specify which cases 
ted bundy feels morally compelled as he faces death to do the 
right thing in terms of resolving any investigations she said 
adding that his execution would effectively cripple law 
enforcement agencies around the country 
martinez disagreed but said he would make bundy available to any 
law agency in the next few days i know that he has basically lied 
through this entire process and why anyone would believe he would 
tell the truth now is beyond me he said 
the governor signed the death warrant on tuesday minutes after 
the us supreme court declined to hear arguments on setting aside 
bundys death sentence 
bundy agreed to an interview with utah detectives investigating 
the deaths or disappearances of five women in 1974 and 1975 when 
bundy was a student at the university of utah law school salt lake 
county deputies reported 
bundy and his attorneys agreed to a twohour conference at noon 
sunday

tulips are popping up in normandy hedgehogs are 
skipping hibernation in britain muscovites are abandoning their fur 
hats and swiss ski resort operators are complaining 
europe is in the midst of a mild spell that not only is throwing 
some seasonal clocks out of whack but could cause serious economic 
problems for businesses and farms 
skiing is impossible but the ice rink is open and guests can 
play cards said a spokesman for the tourist office at san 
bernadino on the southern side of the swiss alps 
hedgehogs are not hibernating they are running about the 
roads and being knocked down said sue stocker who runs a 
wildlife hospital at aylesbury north of london we have more than 
100 hedgehog patients more than twice the usual number 
lyman king who raises ponies in st aubin du thenney west of 
paris predicted that animals are probably going to cycle into 
their spring heat and spring functions earlier than normal that 
could spell trouble if we get a late cold watch the birds around 
your house theyll be doing things they dont do until march or 
april 
indeed a confused blackbird in cheltenham england set up 
housekeeping in a christmas tree on the balcony of a department 
store 
it is raising three chicks two months before normal nesting 
time said assistant store manager adam hands 
in normally glacial moscow the temperature this week was 34 
degrees turning the soviet capitals sidewalks into a slippery 
obstacle course of halfmelted ice many russians left their shapka 
fur hats at home and donned stocking caps something they dont 
usually do until march or april 
accompanying the warm spell is a winter drought 
the french weather service says the drought is the worst since 
1976 that means low water tables for next spring and summer 
in the french alps not a snowflake has fallen since dec 20 in 
the southern alps only eight of 40 resorts remain open 
in central england the nottingham wildlife trust called out the 
fire brigade to fill water holes in blidworth woods where toads 
were arriving to spawn two months early but the ponds and lakes are 
dry 
lack of snow means fewer skiers and fewer skiers means fewer 
hotel rooms rented fewer meals consumed in restaurants and fewer 
parkas and gloves purchased 
resort operators in the piedmont region of italy estimate their 
losses at 120 million due to lack of snow and skiers officials 
there say they will ask for disaster relief 
the absence of a solid freeze in many areas will mean poorer soil 
conditions freezing breaks up and aerates the soil 
winter wheat and winter barley have started greening in some 
countries 
the sap is running in the trees said normandy farmer pierre 
gontier and its been so warm the slugs are coming out and eating 
the grain shoots 
bruno pusterla of the italian agriculture confederation said 
if it does not snow and a lot within this month we will have no 
water to submerge 370000 acres of rice 
high temperatures are going to cost the dutch government an 
estimated 80 million in lost revenues from natural gas used for 
heating said a spokesman for dutch gasunie the countrys gas 
monopoly 
all of this is being caused by a highpressure system that has 
remained stationary over europe pulling warmer air up from northern 
africa 
for the greeks the warm wave isnt unusual january always 
brings 15 sunny days known since antiquity as the alcyonides the 
twoweek spell of warm windless weather was welcomed by the 
ancients but is cursed by todays athenians the mixture of still 
weather and high temperatures now means smog 
only normally sunny portugal seems to have escaped the mild wave 
motorists en route to the city of guarda which housed king 
sancho is court in the 11th century told police of encountering 
freezing fog icy roads and 26 degree temperatures

george bushs choice to be budget director shut 
the door on the prospect of tax increases to balance the budget a 
week after he suggested a number of revenue raisers 
richard darman nominated by bush to be director of the office of 
managment and budget insisted during five hours of testimony 
thursday that bush was not wavering in his readmylips stand 
against tax increases 
darman who served as a white house aide and deputy treasury 
secretary during the reagan administration was questioned at length 
about such things as higher gasoline taxes boosts in levies on 
cigarettes and alcohol taxing employeeprovided fringe benefits and 
taxing a larger proportion of social security benefits for 
highincome beneficiaries 
in written responses provided to the senate governmental affairs 
committee last week darman had suggested these various proposals 
which would raise billions of dollars in new revenues could be 
described as user fees or benefit reductions rather than 
taxes 
democrats seized on darmans written response as the first signal 
that the new administration might be receptive to revenue increases 
many democrats in congress believe bush will eventually be forced to 
propose higher taxes to pay for the increases in education day care 
and the environment which he is expected to seek 
darman said thursday however 
the president meant no new taxes as it would ordinarily be 
understood by ordinary americans i think the burden of that is the 
duck test if it looks like a duck its a duck 
darman who repeatedly used the fowl analogy during the hearing 
was presented by sen john glenn dohio the committee chairman 
with a mock trophy featuring three rubber ducks and the label if 
it quacks its a tax 
sen carl levin dmich said he believed darman had left bush 
with some wiggle room room on the tax issue despite darmans 
protestations that bushs feet were set in concrete 
there will not be any new taxes in the bush budget as defined 
by a reasonable observer darman told reporters during a break in 
the hearing 
however darman did carve out some exceptions that he said would 
not qualify as a tax in part because the revenues raised would be 
relatively small 
one of those items requiring state and local government workers 
to pay for medicare coverage would bring in an additional 2 
billion next year that idea was in reagans final budget and bush 
has supported it in the past darman said 
darman also indicated that another reagan budget proposal to 
raise 1 billion in new revenues by imposing a variety of user fees 
such as a required 25 boat decal and higher charges to veterans 
taking out home loans could also show up when bush submits his own 
budget plan 
those were among the few hints he revealed about what might be in 
bushs budget plan which will go to congress after bush addresses a 
joint session on the deficit issue a speech expected to take place 
feb 9 
the senate governmental affairs committee had high praise for 
darmans skills as a political strategist and members said they 
especially liked darmans appeal for a greater amount of cooperation 
with the democraticcontrolled congress 
glenn predicted that darmans nomination would clear the panel on 
monday and be easily approved by the full senate later in the week

only the threepiece suits jewels furs and 
high heels suggested that this was anything different from a line of 
people appealing traffic tickets or social security decisions 
but the folks who gathered in a convention center holding room 
had come from around the country to participate in george bushs 
inauguration as americas 41st president only to find that their 
tickets were missing 
its been tense said volunteer elizabeth barton as she 
sifted through a stack of yellow special assistance forms marked 
resolved 
no one has actually come across the table and grabbed anyone 
but people have cried and people have shouted theyve stomped on 
their coats they say but i know some heavy people here or im a 
doctor 
there was a multitude of horror stories in the error 
resolution area on thursday and tom keller had one of them 
a young republican from arlington va keller said his inaugural 
ball tickets were delivered to someone else when he wasnt home 
we think it was a maintenance man who was walking out of 
another apartment he said he signed for them and took them 
my dates on hold i dont know if shes gone out and spent a lot of 
money on a dress 
jeanine heitman of west palm beach fla ordered and paid for 
two ball tickets but when she went to pick them up there was only 
one 
lynn remeika of bladensburg md paid for two ball tickets with 
a check her bank said had cleared but when she went to pick them 
up there were none 
at least one couple departed for washington a day too early 
their tickets are in oklahoma said volunteer ann green 
behind the scenes 14 operators tapped into 14 computers to track 
not only inaugural ticket orders but federal express deliveries as 
well 
volunteers periodically emerged from the computer room with news 
ranging from you should get your ticket to credit was refused 
on the date received and no tickets are available then there was 
the somewhat ominous they want to see you back there just come 
with me 
kathy dalton of birmingham mich ordered and paid for four ball 
tickets but received only two im sure theyll straighten it 
out she said calmly asked about her equanimity she replied 
if it was tomorrow at 6 pm id be going crazy 
but not all was graciousness and patience 
john e davis a volunteer who was director of error resolution 
for president reagans 1985 inauguration said more than 500 people 
a day had been taken care of one way or another since the 
process began on monday he said many of their problems involved 
late orders or illegitimate invitations and had nothing to do with 
the inaugural committee 
its much better this year davis said in 1981 there were 
thousands of errors in 1985 there were hundreds and in 1989 there 
were dozens

in the blink of an eye in a ceremony as old as 
the republic ronald reagan is transformed from mr president the 
most powerful man in the world to mr citizen 
he will keep the title as an honorific all the presidents do 
but the mantle of office falls away completely he becomes nothing 
exofficio he casts no votes he has no say and his counsel if 
it is sought at all is sought as a courtesy 
he becomes a member of a most exclusive club that of 
expresidents which will number more than three on inauguration day 
for the first time since 1861 the others are reagans immediate 
predecessors richard nixon jimmy carter and gerald ford 
ronald reagan has joked about what he will do immediately 
as soon as i get home to california he said i plan to 
lean back kick up my feet and take a long nap 
that wont be so different from other recent presidents 
harry truman took the train home to independence and said the 
first thing he did was to carry the luggage into the attic the next 
morning he was up at 730 having slept unusually late and walked 
into his front yard to get the paper 
my return to ordinary citizenship began a new life filled with 
new meaning he said afterward after all the crowds and furor 
the whole business did not seem so easy were the people going to 
let me become a private citizen or was i still going to have to 
live up to the title of mr president that the people insisted on 
using 
truman was blessed with living in less dangerous times at first 
his only added security was the fence that the secret service had 
put up around the house at 219 north delaware and a former highway 
patrolman who doubled as chauffeur and bodyguard he took his 
morning walks down to the town square often unnoticed if you wanted 
to talk to him you had to do it at 120 paces a minute but you 
could do it only in his later years were laws passed that beefed up 
his protection at government expense 
dwight d eisenhower who hated top hats had dictated the 
wearing of homburgs at his own inauguration john f kennedy aware 
of that mischievously ruled that top hats be worn at his 
swearingin and eisenhower as the outgoing president was forced to 
comply 
no wonder he told reporters as he was driven out of washington 
that it was wonderful to shed the burdens of the presidency he and 
mamie were driven in a fourcar convoy to their farm in gettysburg 
pa the next day he attended a dinner thrown in his honor by the 
townsfolk and a couple of days later he was in albany ga shooting 
quail 
the latter was in the tradition set by theodore roosevelt who 
went on an african safari after leaving the jungles of washington 
ford didnt bother to go home he stayed long enough to hear 
jimmy carters inaugural address got his helicopter pilot to make 
one last swing over the white house and the capitol flew to 
california and before the day was out was hitting golf balls off a 
practice tee 
the next day he was arnold palmers partner in the bing crosby 
proam tournament at pebble beach ford told reporters he thought he 
had prepared himself well for the swift switch in power we 
certainly took the attitude that our time had ended and president 
carters time had begun ford said 
but he wiped away a tear or two at the airport saying i dont 
deny i got a little sentimental but i tried not to expose it to 
keep it within myself 
carters leavetaking and nixons for different reasons were 
the most traumatic 
carter had stayed up all night handling final details of a 
complicated deal worked out with iran to gain freedom for 52 
american hostages who had been held hostage for 444 days he 
catnapped on the oval office couch and left for the reagan 
swearingin only at the last minute 
en route to the capitol carter got word the iranians had agreed 
but the first planeload did not take off from tehran until five 
minutes into the reagan presidency 
the 39th president flew to georgia in air force one and to plains 
in a helicopter at 430 am the next day he boarded the same 
aircraft for germany to greet the returning hostages carter flew 
back home after a few hours on the ground 
nixon too had a fitful last night in the white house on aug 
8 1974 he had told the nation that because the watergate scandal 
had eroded his political muscle i shall resign the presidency 
effective at noon tomorrow 
afterward his family consoled him and nixon went to bed with the 
sound of protesters outside chanting what his daughter described as 
their sick message in the morning he had corned beef hash and 
poached eggs alone in the lincoln sitting room signed a message of 
resignation addressed to the secretary of state and said a tearful 
goodbye to his administration 
this was the nightmare end of a long dream he wrote later 
i had come so far from the little house in yorba linda calif to 
this great house in washington 
he too flew back home on air force one to years of 
selfimposed exile before he ventured forth again 
there was no talk there were no tears left nixon said of 
seeing the white house retreating in the distance he leaned his 
head back against the seat and closed his eyes then heard his wife 
saying to no one in particular its so sad its so sad

entertainer wayne newton says a public survey 
satisfied him that his reputation has been restored since he won a 
multimillion dollar libel lawsuit against nbc 
this was not a matter of money this was a matter of 
vindication of my name newton said thursday after filing papers 
in federal court to collect a 6 million libel award against nbc 
over a 1980 broadcast linking him to an organized crime figure 
a federal jury in las vegas awarded a record 223 million to 
newton in 1986 but a judge reduced it to 53 million and last 
month ordered him to accept the lower sum or face proving his case 
again in a new trial this time in los angeles 
newtons lawyer morton galane said that with interest the 53 
million award now equals 6 million 
galane said a survey conducted for newton satisfied him that his 
image had been restored and that the public understood he had won 
his case 
nbc said it would appeal the network said that a trial in los 
angeles would be less likely to produce the results seen in las 
vegas

thursday at the us district court building the only thing that 
has interrupted my schedule is this grand jury appearance 
kenneth mundy barrys attorney said he has received assurances 
that barry is not a target of the probe no federal official could 
be reached to comment on mundys claim

the grand jury but had earlier said that investigators are 
gathering information on whether barry thwarted a police drug 
investigation and are also looking into the possible misuse of 
government funds

grueling process but neither he nor the mayor would offer any 
details about what barry had been asked on his way into the jury 
room barry had said im not in trouble

make an undercover drug purchase from a former city employee

also acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the

interior secretary donald p hodel in his last 
full day on the job on thursday lowered the rates oil companies pay 
for drilling on federal land and recommended opening the vast alaska 
wildlife refuge to oil exploration 
the moves are aimed at boosting the nations sagging oil 
production spokesmen for the interior department said in telephone 
interviews thursday 
hodels decision to cut the rental fees for drilling on federal 
land by up to twothirds could cost taxpayers an estimated 35 
million annually the new york times reported in its thursday 
editions 
rental rates which now range from 2 to 3 will be lowered to 1 
per acre when the action published in thursdays federal register 
takes effect march 1 
this is aimed at lessening the so called regulatory or 
antiproductive red tape in hopes that it would be more viable for 
domestic concerns to explore and develop new domestic energy 
sources said timothy lock a spokesman for the bureau of land 
management 
about 70 million acres of federal land are currently leased by 
oil companies but about half of them are already rented at the 1 
per acre rate said marta witt a spokeswoman for blm 
in the second move hodel recommended that congress allow native 
alaska corporations to trade ownership of land they hold for mineral 
rights to thousands of acres in the federal arctic national wildlife 
refuge interior department spokesman tom wilson said 
the right to allow such exchanges rests with congress 
the federal land would remain us government property with the 
indian eskimo and aleut corporations taking over rights to what oil 
analysts project as massive oil deposits below the prudhoe bay 
region 
this is supposedly one of the richest potential spots for oil 
left in the united states off or on shore said wilson the 
geology is such that oil people feel that it has greater potential 
than any place they can think of remaining in this country 
the american petroleum institute announced on wednesday that 
energy use in this country rose to record levels in 1988 while us 
imports jumped 9 percent to the highest levels in nine years at the 
same time api reported that domestic oil production slumped to 81 
million barrels a day last year down 3 percent from 1987 
lock speaking of the decrease in rental rates said this 
action is consistent with other steps the department has taken over 
the past two years when oil prices bottomed out and us production 
began to dwindle to the point of serious concerns to the point of 
even national security impact

the leading opposition parties of panama say 
they will present a single candidate in the may 7 presidential 
elections against a ticket backed by military strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
ricardo arias calderon leader of the christian democrat party 
said the names of the presidential and two vice presidential 
candiates will be announced today 
arias calderon said thursday that the decision to oppose the 
government with a single candidate gives the elections the 
character of a yesno referendum on noriega chief of panamas 
defense forces 
it does not matter who the government candidate is he will be 
transparent and the people will see noriega through him arias 
calderon said 
president ricardo delvalle tried to fire noriega who was 
indicted last year by a us federal grand jury on drug charges but 
was deposed by the noriegacontrolled national assembly and replaced 
by manuel solis palma 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as leader and has 
pressured noriega to step down and return the country to civilian 
rule it has imposed economic sanctions that include withholding 
payments to the country for panama canal operations 
arias calderon said the oppositions presidential candidate will 
come from the authentic panamanian party and the two vice 
presidential candidates from the christian democrats and the liberal

george bush is riding into the white house on a 
flood tide of inaugural revelry by republican partisans who are 
drinking dancing and spending big bucks with such abandon that one 
peevish democrat called it a corporate pigout 
a solemn pause in the virtually nonstop partying came today with 
an expected 300000 spectators due at the west front of the capitol 
to watch bush take the presidential oath his only constitutional 
duty of the day 
then after the traditional inaugural parade down pennsylvania 
avenue the merrymaking will resume with the new chief executive and 
his vice president dan quayle visiting 60000 gop faithful at no 
fewer than 11 inaugural balls around town that promise to rock until 
the wee hours saturday 
celebrants are paying 175 a ticket for blacktie balls at such 
locales as the national air and space museum where texans will kick 
up their booted heels while young people will be admitted to two 
casualdress dances at 30 a head 
except for a speech before a youth forum thursday morning bush 
relinquished the social spotlight for the rest of the day to quayle 
the indiana senator was the feature attraction at a vice 
presidential reception at the national museum of american history 
and at a dinnerdance of 2300 fellow hoosiers in a hotel ballroom 
not to be outdone by the hundreds of glitzy republican bashes 
everywhere they looked democrats held a majority party party in 
a small ballroom in a downtown hotel and assured everyone that they 
werent sulking 
were not wallflowers said rep beryl anthony dark 
were power brokers 
but rep pat schroeder dcolo couldnt resist taking a swipe 
at the opposition she said the republican frolicking looks like a 
corporate pigout with enough lear jets parked at national 
airport to outfit an air force 
a lot of minks are going to give their lives for this 
weekend she said 
while the democrats settled for country singer jerry jeff walker 
a deejay and a bad ronald reagan imitator at their party 12000 
republicans crowded into the cavernous washington convention center 
for a twohour nationally televised inaugural gala thursday night 
that was packed with such show business celebrities as frank 
sinatra bob hope julio iglesias nell carter and country music 
stars randy travis and loretta lynn 
seated in a special box with family and friends bush clapped his 
hands to a footstomping song by the oak ridge boys bounced a 
grandchild on his knee and joined quayle and the blacktie audience 
in singing the starspangled banner 
the entertainers tossed verbal bouquets at bush from the stage 
muscleman arnold schwarzenegger dubbing himself conan the 
republican said it was a time for new beginnings and for 
americans to follow bushs leadership toward a kinder gentler 
nation 
comedian bob hope recalled that an earlier president had called 
his job a splendid misery and told bush that americans were 
praying that it will be nothing but splendid for you after a 
rousing song and dance routine nell carter offered to serve bush as 
an ambassador 
at the end of the show the presidentelect mounted the stage and 
promised that ill work my hardest i will do my best and with 
the help of the american people i believe we can get the job done 
as if to respond to protesters who tried to disrupt the gala and 
a lavish 1500aplate dinner at union station the previous night 
bush said it was proper that we salute the stability and 
continuity of the american system 
outside the convention center three dozen gay and lesbian rights 
demonstrators shouted at the gala guests arriving in stretch 
limousines its all a sham its all a lie you dance while we 
die the protesters chanted 
tickets to the soldout gala ranged as high as 25000 for 
eightseat boxes in front of the stage those proceeds plus 
49 million from sales of tv commercials yielded about 9 million 
in gross revenues to help defray the record 25 million in costs for 
four days of privately financed inaugural festivities

elizabeth dole came closer to becoming the top 
woman in the bush administration after promising senators she would 
implement a growth plus policy as labor secretary but avoiding 
specific answers on the minimum wage and job protection for new 
mothers 
the senate labor committee on thursday unanimously approved her 
nomination after a 2hour hearing in which mrs dole outlined a 
policy to provide workers with the jobs and skills of the future 
while the former transportation secretary and wife of senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan credited the past six years of 
uninterrupted economic growth for reducing the nations jobless rate 
to a 14year low she said that is not enough for the future 
the mission of the labor department must be to coordinate a 
strategy of growth plus growth plus policies to help those for 
whom the jobs of the future are now out of reach because of a skills 
gap family pressures or lack of supportive policies she said 
citing an aging labor force growing at a rate of only 1 percent a 
year with a shrinking supply of teenage workers mrs dole said the 
future offers unprecedented opportunities and challenges 
we have within our reach the fulfillment of a longawaited 
dream that every american who wants a job can have a job she 
said 
but to do it she said will require a coordinated effort by 
government business union education and community leaders to 
wipe out illiteracy and enhance skills through basic education 
training and retraining 
mrs dole 52 was picked by bush on christmas eve to be the only 
woman in his cabinet a role she also held in president reagans 
administration as transportation secretary from 1983 until october 
1987 
both she and labor secretary william brock resigned from the 
cabinet then to help her husbands campaign against bush for the gop 
presidential nomination reagan then tapped ann mclaughlin for the 
labor post where she filled a like role as the only woman in his 
cabinet the last 13 months of his administration 
the committees chairman sen edward m kennedy dmass said 
he expects mrs doles formal nomination which will be submitted by 
bush just after his inauguration today to be voted on by the full 
senate next week aides said senate leaders were looking at jan 25 
as a possible date 
during her hearing thursday mrs dole successfully ducked 
several questions on the social legislative initiatives democrats 
are likely to use to test bushs promise of a kinder and gentler 
america 
i share your concern and look forward to working with you on 
that issue was her answer to a wide variety of questions from 
senators trying to pin her down on the minimum wage parental 
leaves child care health insurance and pension issues 
but she indicated she would follow the lead of her predecessor in 
encouraging progressive workfamily policies on the part of 
businesses and unions rather than mandating solutions to the 
lowest common denominator

john tower fails to meet the ethical standards 
george bush envisioned for his administration says a leading 
conservative who wants to testify against the former senators 
confirmation as secretary of defense 
president bush had indicated one thing he was going to do was 
raise the standards of the people he would be appointing paul 
weyrich said thursday the only area where he distanced himself 
from reagan was that whole question selecting tower sends the wrong 
signal 
weyrich said he wrote sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee on dec 23 and requested a chance 
to appear at towers confirmation hearings scheduled to begin jan 
25 
a spokesman for nunn said a decision has not been made on the 
request 
the 63yearold tower who served as chairman of the armed 
services committee was named to become secretary of defense 
selected after a lengthy background check that pushed the texans 
private life into the forefront 
there was a bitter divorce in which towers exwife charged 
marital misconduct and tales of drinking and womanizing 
questions also arose about the propriety of naming a someone to head 
the pentagon who had worked as a consultant to many defense 
companies 
weyrich chairman of the conservative coalitions for america 
think tank also expressed reservations about towers defense 
record citing his position on the strategic defense initiative 
commonly known as star wars and military reform 
he considers sdi a bargaining chip we dont weyrich said 
hes not in favor of military reform we think military reform is 
necessary particularly in this year of budget crunch 
we wonder how he can possibly carry this stuff out in the 
position of secretary of defense he said 
weyrich refused to provide specifics of his complaints saying he 
would save them for his testimony the conservative official has 
spoken informally to members of nunns staff about his request for 
time but received no indication when the committee might decide 
despite his arguments weyrich believes that tower will win 
confirmation 
hes a member of the club the club always protects its own 
he said

a federal judge is blocking the white house 
from destroying national security council computer information that 
investigators found useful in unraveling the irancontra affair 
us district judge barrington parker issued a temporary 
restraining order thursday protecting information generated on the 
professional office system or profs the system put in operation 
in 1985 is used by nsc personnel and white house staff to 
communicate on an internal electronic mail network 
former national security adviser john poindexter and fired nsc 
aide oliver north used the system frequently from it congressional 
and criminal investigators retrieved messages in reconstructing the 
irancontra affair 
assistant attorney general john bolton argued at a hearing that 
stopping the housecleaning process of getting rid of information 
would impair operations of the incoming bush administration 
but parker said the decision to block the destruction was 
maintenance of the status quo and questioned whether harm would be 
done by keeping information in the system intact 
parker issued the restraining order at the request of the 
national security archive a private repository of government 
information and a division of the american civil liberties union a 
hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction will be held 
wednesday before us district judge charles richey 
the groups sued president reagan presidentelect george bush and 
the archivist of the united states saying in a statement they are 
trying to prevent the destruction of historically significant 
white house computer tapes during the last three years of the 
reagan administration 
the information in the system is contained on magnetic tapes 
which we were told the white house destroys from time to time 
attorney kate martin said at a hearing where parker granted the 
restraining order 
the irancontra affair illustrated the importance of 
information stored in the profs system scott armstrong founder 
of the national security archive a nonprofit group said in an 
affidavit despite repeated attempts by nsc staff to shred the 
paper record and delete the computer record the profs backup system 
on magnetic tape allowed investigators to reconstruct much of the 
irancontrarelated activity 
the computer tapes are the only existing record of many 
important communications within the white house and specifically 
within the national security council at the close of the reagan 
administration ms martin said in a memorandum filed in federal 
court 
bolton chief of the justice departments civil division said 
however the destruction is not some sinister conspiracy 
the archivist has given approval to erase these systems and 
none of the information has any relevance or anything to do 
with the irancontra affair said bolton 
bolton compared the system to an electronic mail setup in place 
at the justice department in which people can play back their 
messages when they return to the office rather than having to play 
telephone tag 
guidance issued by the archives and white house counsel instructs 
profs users to print out in paper form any significant profs 
messages for the permanent files and only those paper records are 
considered presidential records and permanently preserved

inaugural gala guests who waited patiently in 
furs and jewels to endure scrupulous security checks were confronted 
with protesters audibly upset with the impending presidency of 
george bush 
its all a sham its all a lie you dance while we die 
screamed three dozen gay and lesbian rights demonstrators outside 
the convention center gala thursday night 
the reason were here is that 32 million is being spent on the 
inauguration said robert bray of washington a spokesman for the 
demonstrators we want to call attention to the fact that theres 
a huge problem george bush must face he has been handed this legacy 
by former president reagan and he has to handle it 
the protesters complied with police requests to keep their circle 
moving and to leave part of the sidewalk open for passersby but 
they declined to turn down their megaphone and police did not 
pursue their request for a quieter demonstration 
several of the blacktie clad guests expressed annoyance with the 
protesters who shouted money for aids not for inaugurals and 
bush quayle you cant hide we charge you with genocide 
i think they like trying to rain on somebody elses parade 
said doug richardson who works with the transition for 
transportation secretarydesignate samuel skinner 
i dont think its appropriate at all said tom aubrey of the 
american bankers association one of 12000 guests at the nationally 
televised gala starring frank sinatra chuck yeager loretta lynn 
and randy travis among others i dont think a celebratory 
evening is the time or place for this kind of demonstration 
the protests this week have been peaceful which was the plan set 
by the counterinaugural coalition for a peoples agenda the 
coalition which has some 80 member groups ranging from the gray 
panthers to the committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador agreed in advance not to stage civil disobedience 
and there was no disobedience among the guests at thursday 
nights gala who waited calmly sometimes jammed together to be 
screened by metal detectors and to have their handbags and cameras 
scrutinized by uniformed secret service officers 
back home they may be treated with kid gloves but at the gala 
everyone got checked including entertainer bob hope 
itll be a privilege to see george bush said mrs paul 
harrington of rochester ny who was near the end of the line as 
it wrapped around the convention center id wait all week 
linda skladany of danville va said the waiting added to the 
festivity of the occasion 
it kind of gets your adrenalin going said mrs skladany who 
lost a special election for a congressional seat last july its 
like going to the super bowl 
sally campbell of slidell la said she appreciated the tight 
security we dont want anyone to hurt our new president 
the secret service agents took only a few seconds to check 
through most of the handbags they were small but they regularly 
examined cameras by taking off the lens caps and looking through 
guests routinely emptied their pockets to keep the magnetometers 
from sounding out came the keys off came heavy bracelets a few 
women doffed huge stoneencrusted belts 
one man whose attempt to walk through the magnetometer set off 
the alarm dumped a pile of belongings including a dozen rolls of 
film even more batteries a camera and a pipe he then was cleared 
to enter 
secret service agents said they found nothing abnormal except 
some of the purses themselves 
trying to figure out how to get them open was tough one

more than 100 aftershocks reverberated 
through the los angeles area thursday echoing a 50 quake coastal 
quake that shattered shop windows and merchandise but left local 
residents generally unfazed 
the 1054 pm wednesday quake centered eight miles off the 
malibu coast in santa monica bay caused three minor injuries and 
briefly knocked out power to 100000 people 
the number of aftershocks recorded at the california institute of 
technology was between 100 and 200 but that was not terribly 
unusual hall daily a spokesman for caltech said late thursday 
most were too small to measure said lucile jones seismologist 
at the california institute of technology in pasadena 
but two aftershocks one at 202 pm and the other at 209 pm 
tentatively measured 37 and 35 on the richter scale respectively 
they were the largest of as many as 200 aftershocks said caltech 
spokesman hall daily 
the quake shattered windows at the natural progression surf shop 
deanes sportswear super care drugs and bay cities beauty supply 
near the malibu civic center rocks slid down the twisting malibu 
canyon road and blew out some car tires 
theres a million bottles on the ground of dye and hair color 
bottles theyre broken and stained the rugs its a big mess we 
cant even open said beauty shop worker becky granados 
our front window exploded and a lot of the surfboards fell 
over but they were not injured said surf shop employee grady 
hinsche 
tiles fell off the law school building at pepperdine university 
and the bar at alices restaurant on the malibu pier was littered 
with broken bottles 
as businesses cleaned up life returned to southern california 
normal in this celebrity enclave 30 miles southwest of los angeles 
home of sylvester stallone johnny carson dustin hoffman and others 
beachgoers tanned on the sands enjoying near80 degree 
temperatures and a few surfers paddled in the calm waters 
the quake which measured 50 on the richter scale at caltech 
shook downtown los angeles skyscrapers and was felt 60 miles away in 
riverside countythe temblor struck with the same magnitude of a 50 
earthquake on dec 3 that was centered beneath downtown pasadena 
the strongest recent earthquake was the deadly whittier narrows 
quake of oct 1 1987 which measured 59 on the richter scale that 
quake and its 53magnitude aftershock on oct 4 killed eight 
people injured more than 200 others and caused 358 million in 
damage 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale can cause considerable 
damage

differences in the brain structure of male 
and female rats allow the males to learn to navigate a maze more 
quickly but females are less fooled by changes in landmarks a 
researcher says 
it doesnt suggest that males or females are better at solving 
spatial tasks psychologist christina williams of barnard college 
of columbia university in new york city said thursday it merely 
means they go about it in different ways 
williams and warren h meck another columbia researcher also 
found that brain structure can be altered in a way that seems to 
improve memory by giving rats choline a b vitamin rich in foods 
common in traditional japanese diets 
williams speaking at the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science said she believed there 
were similarities between rats brains and human brains but said 
she could draw no conclusions about human behavior from the maze 
studies 
i have no data on humans she said 
male and female rat brains are different because male brains are 
exposed to testosterone and related male sex hormones early in the 
animals life williams said 
she has found that female rats exposed to testosterone develop 
malelike brains and males deprived of the hormone develop 
femalelike brains 
it has been known that hormones govern the number of cells in the 
brain where cells move as the brain develops and the strength of 
connections between the cells the researchers said 
in the dietary study rats given choline early in their 
development can remember more and remember it longer meck said 
some foods are especially rich in choline especially soybeans 
rice seaweed and raw fish he noted 
but meck said there have been no studies yet to determine whether 
the cholinerich diet of the japanese might improve their memories 
and cautioned that people should not begin consuming such foods to 
try to improve their memories 
the researchers also noted that choline and hormones affect the 
brain only early in its development and would have no impact on 
adult rat or human brains the hormones alter rat brains immediately 
after birth and human brains before birth 
in addition some choline supplements available in health food 
stores also contain fats that could counteract any possible effect 
of choline meck said 
williams said her studies of navigation were intended to 
determine how differences in behavior are related to differences in 
brain structure 
males find food in the maze by learning about the geometric 
properties of the maze and the room theyre in angles and 
distances williams said but females do more 
female brains not only store information about these geometric 
relationships but they also store information about landmarks the 
experimenter the lack of cages on the left side of the room or a 
large plate glass window in the room she said 
thus if shapes and distances are changed males will have 
difficulties females on the other hand can rely on the landmarks 
to orient themselves 
the reason males learn to get through the maze more quickly may 
be that they have less to learn about the room williams said 
females are storing more stimuli she said 
learning and practice williams said can easily compensate for 
any sex differences that may be due to differences in brain 
structure

new genetic findings will let doctors diagnose 
elephant mans disease before symptoms appear and help 
scientists find the gene that causes the disease which afflicts at 
least 100000 americans experts say 
the findings will also permit prenatal diagnosis they said 
thursday 
early diagnosis will allow doctors to act early to reduce the 
severity of the disease which causes tumors to grow anywhere in the 
nervous system and can lead to severe disfigurement deafness 
blindness brain cancers and spinal deformity 
some 40 percent to 60 percent of patients also suffer learning 
disabilities 
the findings are going to usher in a new era in us being able 
to provide services of various types for people with this 
disorder said allan rubenstein medical director of the national 
neurofibromatosis foundation 
the disease formally called neurofibromatosis 1 strikes in 
about one in every 4000 live births 
about half the new cases of the disease result from inheriting 
the neurofibromatosis gene while the other half occur 
spontaneously diagnostic testing based on the new research will 
work only in people with a family history of the disease 
finding the gene would allow testing of other people as well 
said francis collins of the university of michigan and once 
researchers isolate the gene and analyze its workings they should 
get hints about how to counter its effects on the body which could 
lead to better treatments he said 
the research is reported in the january issue of the american 
journal of human genetics by an international consortium of 
researchers led by collins bernd seizinger of harvard medical 
school and bruce ponder of royal marsden hospital in england 
the scientists followed up on the 1987 discovery that the gene 
causing the disorder lay somewhere within a portion of chromosome 
17 one of the 23 versions of the threadlike structures that carry 
human hereditary information 
their new work narrows the possible location of the gene to about 
5 percent of the chromosome they found genetic signposts called 
markers that lie close to the gene on each side 
since the markers tend to be inherited along with the gene 
people who have them are highly likely to carry the gene as well 
the markers will be useful for early or prenatal diagnosis in an 
estimated 80 percent to 90 percent of families that have had a case 
of neurofibromatosis said rubenstein 
diagnosis is now based on symptoms suggestive early signs of the 
disease are often noticed shortly after birth but in about a 
quarter of cases a diagnosis cannot be confirmed until adolescence 
when other symptoms appear said rubenstein 
in addition he said perhaps about 10 percent of the nations at 
least 100000 neurofibromatosis cases lack classical symptoms so 
that no definite diagnosis can be made that poses a problem as a 
person approaches childbearing years and wants to know if he or she 
carries the faulty gene which could be passed to a child 
rubenstein said 
by diagnosing neurofibromatosis before symptoms appear doctors 
will know who should be followed closely with physical examinations 
looking for problems that can be treated before they cause serious 
trouble said john carey associate professor of pediatrics at the 
university of utah 
while prenatal diagnosis raises the possibility of an abortion 
that decision is complicated by the fact that most people with 
neurofibromatosis live a normal life without serious medical 
problems carey said 
rubenstein said about half of people with the disease have minor 
skin lesions and learning disabilities but no major medical 
problems another quarter have significant but correctable medical 
problems and the balance have severe and untreatable medical 
problems 
the disease gained its nickname from a disfigured 19th century 
englishman who was exhibited at side shows as the elephant man but 
since then researchers have determined he actually had a different 
disease

jc combs isnt your typical university 
music professor not when he performs concerts with pizza pans and 
velcro and writes compositions like pizza hut 234 
but the 48yearold wichita state professor with a reputation as 
a nontraditional composer and percussionist says hes not trying 
to be strange 
we just enjoy doing experimental theater with percussion he 
said luckily theres an audience for it 
on sunday combs will stage a concert titled now that was 
definitely different a percussion concert featuring rock drums 
pizza pans and velcro 
the concert isnt the first such event he has helped put on 
during his 19 years at wichita state he was involved in war 
games a piece written by a colleague for performance by 
professional wrestlers and a percussion orchestra that was made into 
an awardwinning video by a nebraska educational television station 
combs and his colleagues also did a concert with pinball machines 
and percussion 
the latest concert will open with edgard varese in the gobi 
desert a piece performed by six percussionists on a variety of 
drums body slapping sometimes called hamboning chanting 
fireworks and velcro tap dancing also are featured 
a combs composition called pizza hut 234 will have several 
percussion students portraying pizza parlor workers who discover the 
different tones of their pizza boxes pans and cooking utensils a

rosanne ponchick teanecks most famous 
teatotaling teacher was falling way short of her goal to collect 1 
million tea tags 
but wednesday 13 crates of unused tea tags were carted into ms 
ponchicks secondgrade classroom at longfellow school the crates 
courtesy of tetley inc contained 1 million tags 
now ms ponchicks students will have to count them which was 
the original reason for the collection she said thursday 
it all started when a child asked me what a million was she 
said i tried to figure out how to show what it looked like i 
came up with tea tags 
ms ponchick said she started collecting the tags about 10 years 
ago but got serious in the past year 
media coverage of her collection helped swell the number past 
200000 last fall including 300 different varieties from around the 
world 
what ms ponchick and her students learned was the difficulty of 
collecting a million of anything let alone counting that far she 
said 
in shelton conn tetley president hank mcinerney got wind of 
the project and directed that the 1 million tags still on rolls in 
a warehouse in williamsport pa be sent to the school 
the tags have already given the students an important geography 
lesson ms ponchick said now they must get the counting right

researchers reported today they have the first 
evidence directly linking smoking and heart disease but tobacco 
industry officials rejected the claim saying the illness can be 
tied to a number of causes 
the studys authors say smokers were three times more likely than 
nonsmokers to have angina or chest pains and painless periods of 
inadequate blood flow to the heart 
an editorial accompanying the research in the journal of the 
american medical association said the study was the longsought 
smoking gun showing a link between smoking and heart ailments 
gary miller a spokesman for the tobacco industrys 
washingtonbased tobacco institute disputed that saying this is 
not really enough evidence to make such a claim 
miller noted the study involved only two dozen smokers fortyone 
nonsmokers also participated 
the study based at brigham and womens hospital in boston was 
conducted by attaching a monitor to patients hearts the patients 
all of whom had been diagnosed as having heart disease wore the 
monitors for 24 hours while they went about their daily routines 
in tests from october 1984 to december 1987 the monitors showed 
975 ischemic episodes or periods of inadequate blood flow 8 
percent of which were accompanied by chest pains the report said 
the median number of episodes over 24 hours was three for smokers 
one for nonsmokers 
dr andrew selwyn a coauthor of the report and a harvard 
medical school associate professor said ischemic episodes damage 
the heart temporarily and can lead to heart attacks 
but the shortterm effects are reversible and very treatable 
the cardiologist said thats what makes it useful to show the 
study to patients and say look you havent damaged your heart 
yet so stop smoking now he said 
this is a solid piece of evidence you can show patients before 
they actually have a heart attack selwyn said i hope its 
ammunition that doctors use to show patients as often as possible 
the tobacco institute spokesman however said anything can 
cause these ischemic episodes caffeine excitement can cause them 
the study showed that the episodes lasted longer among smokers 
whose median episode lasted 24 minutes compared with 2 minutes for 
nonsmokers 
both frequency and duration increased as the number of cigarettes 
increased the study said 
the more they smoke in general the more ischemia they have and 
the greater their risk of heart attack and death selwyn said 
the accompanying editorial said research on smoking and heart 
disease until now has been based on indirect evidence 
what had been lacking was direct evidence a smoking gun 
linking the two wrote dr peter f cohn of the health sciences 
center of the state university of new york at stony brook

federal health authorities are allowing the use 
of a rat virus as part of an experimental treatment of humans for 
melanoma a devastating and often fatal skin cancer 
the decision thursday by the national institutes of health and 
the food and drug administration represents the first approval of a 
therapy using foreign genes transferred into human patients 
the subjects in the experimental treatment will be 10 patients in 
advanced stages of melanoma 
the study is aimed at increasing an understanding of a promising 
new cancer treatment called tumorinfiltrating lymphocyte therapy 
or til that was pioneered by dr steven a rosenberg a national 
cancer institute researcher who will supervise the experiment 
in til therapy tumorfighting white blood cells the body 
develops in small numbers are removed from melanoma tumors allowed 
to grow in large numbers in the laboratory and then are reinjected 
into the patient along with interleukin2 a protein that promotes 
white blood cell growth 
rosenberg published a paper last month in the new england journal 
of medicine in which he reported that of the melanoma patients who 
had not previously been treated with interleukin2 60 percent 
experienced at least a 50 percent reduction in tumor tissue after 
til therapy the study involved 20 patients 
to understand why til therapy works for some but not others 
rosenberg wants to trace the white blood cells after they are 
returned to the patient in order to do this the researcher wants 
to mark the cells with a bacterial gene that produces a resistance 
to neomycin an antibiotic in this way cells from the patients 
tumors or blood stream could be identified and movement of the cells 
into the tumors could be monitored 
but in order to get the gene of the bacteria into the white blood 
cells rosenberg proposed to use a mouse leukemia retrovirus it was 
the use of this virus that triggered seven months of hearings before 
various committees of the nih fda and congress 
rosenberg said the virus is crippled and harmless to humans but 
it retains it ability to carry a gene from one cell into another 
cell 
this has probably been the most carefully reviewed clinical 
protocol ever said every one has examined the safety issues and 
all have decided that the risks are minimal 
he said the plan called for using the virus to carry the 
neomycinresistant gene from the bacteria into the til cell once 
this is done the altered til cells are injected into the patients 
where it is believed they would migrate naturally to the tumor sites 
later biopsies would be made of the tumors and the removed cells 
would be exposed to lethal doses of neomycin cells that had been 
genetically manipulated would not die because they carry the 
neomycinresistant gene in this way rosenberg said the researchers 
would be able to determine the movement of the til cells into the 
tumor 
if the experiment proves successful rosenberg said researchers 
could then use genetically manipulated til cells to carrying other 
cancerfighting genes to the tumors in this way boosting the bodys 
own immune system to fight the cancer 
rosenberg said the clinical experiment could begin within a few 
days and preliminary results should be known within three months

california researchers using a type of electron 
microscope were able to create a direct visual image of the dna 
molecule an accomplishment they say will enable scientists to speed 
up efforts to map the human genetic code 
the image collected by the microscope shows the double helix coil 
that is the molecule of dna or deoxyribonucleic acid magnified one 
million times a report on the study was published today in science 
the journal of the american association for the advancement of 
science 
rod balhorn a biologist at the lawrence livermore national 
laboratory said thursday the development is a major advance in the 
study of genetics because scientists for the first time will be able 
to actually see extremely small molecules that perform key functions 
in the cell 
this is a major new tool that will enable us to actually 
visualize molecules and atoms something that has not been possible 
before he said in a telephone interview 
balhorn said the image enables scientists to clearly see the 
major and minor grooves between strands of the helix coil and to 
pick out specific protein pairs within the helix 
the dna molecule is made up of paired proteins whose sequence 
determines the genetic traits of a cells in effect dna forms the 
biological blueprint for an organism 
dna has been imaged with scanning tunneling microscopes before 
but only after the molecule had been shadowed with metal 
balhorn said the new imaging system may enable scientists to 
speed up their attempt to map the human genetic code by one 
thousandfold he said current cumbersome techniques would require 
more than 20 years mapping the human genetic code or genome would 
enable scientists to determine the precise location and function of 
each human gene 
he cautioned however that it may take biologists time to 
develop the new technique to its full potential 
to make the dna image researchers placed a drop of solution 
containing dna from thymus gland cells of a calf on a graphite chip 
and then placed the specimen in the scanning tunneling microscope 
the sensor of the microscope is a sharptipped needle that can be 
passed within the width of an atom over the specimen as it passes 
a current of electrons leaps across the gap a phenomenon known as 
tunneling while the tip moves the electrons scan the shape of 
the specimen and this motion causes the tip to moves slightly this 
motion is interpreted by a computer to create a threedimensional 
image 
in addition to balhorn coauthors of the study were thomas p 
beebe jr troy e wilson and wigbert j siekhaus of lawrence 
livermore national laboratory in livermore cal and d frank 
ogletree miquel b salmeron and joseph e katz of lawrence berkeley

already badly congested capital during the morning rush hour 
a scotland yard spokeswoman said the bridge would be inspected 
today during low tide to assess the damage and decide whether it 
could reopen 
the tug touchstone was negotiating the river with two barges 
when it struck the northeast corner of the center arch said the 
spokeswoman who in accordance with british practice declined to be

concern with public relations is causing the 
fish and wildlife service to concentrate on rescuing the more 
visible and popular endangered species rather than those in the 
nearest danger a government study says 
the general accounting office in a study of the endangered 
species act 15 years after its passage said thursday an 
overwhelming majority of the hundreds of fragile varieties of 
wildlife protected by the law either show no signs of recovery or 
are sliding closer to extinction 
the congressional agency criticized the fish and wildlife service 
for concentrating on highprofile species such as the bald eagle 
and aleutian canada goose over those that are more seriously 
threatened 
fish and wildlife service officials told gao investigators that 
the desire for a positive public view of the program is 
motivating its actions said the report 
instead of giving priority to the most endangered species and 
to those actions needed to prevent extinctions in the foreseeable 
future as required by its guidelines fws instead is concentrating 
recovery funds on species with high public appeal and those 
approaching recovery the study said 
rep gerry e studds dmass who requested the study said the 
agencys conclusions reinforce my own view that a more serious and 
professional approach to protecting endangered species is required 
if the goals of federal law are to be met 
studds is chairman of the house merchant marine and fisheries 
subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation 
elizabeth lipscomb a spokeswoman for the fish and wildlife 
service which has jurisdiction over the vast majority of the 
threatened and endangered species listed defended the agencys 
programs and practices 
we feel that its important to devote resources to species that 
the public is concerned about high visibility species like the bald 
eagle she said that doesnt necessarily mean were not 
spending money on other species were spending money on a lot of 
obscure species that people dont know about 
the gao study said of the 493 species protected under the 
endangered species act of 1973 five have been declared recovered 
while six have become extinct 
the review also concluded that while 75 of the species have 
improved 165 have declined 12 are extinct but not yet official 
declared so and 179 have shown no change the status of the 
remaining 51 of the species was not known 
the fish and wildlife service had drafted by september 1987 
recovery plans for 56 percent of the species and had plans underway 
for another 18 percent the gao said but many of the tasks outlined 
in the plans to save the species have not been started 
in 16 recovery plans analyzed by gao investigators nearly half 
of the tasks have not been undertaken even though the plans were 
approved on an average of more than four years ago 
the gao report said 12 species are extinct but have yet to be 
declared so they are mariana mallard mariana fruit bat palos 
verdes blue butterfly scioto madtom bachmans warbler giant 
anole tuberculedblossom mussel turgidblossom mussel 
yellowblossom mussel dusky seaside sparrow ivorybilled woodpecker 
and eastern cougar 
five species have been declared recovered but the protections of 
the endangered species act seem to account only for the recovery of 
the american alligator gao said the recovery of the brown pelican 
in the southeastern united states seems to be attributed to the 
nationwide ban on ddt while the recovery of the palau dove 
palau fantail and palau owl simply stems from the discovery of more 
birds

a new process of baking bread without wheat can help 
feed the hungry in developing countries the un food and 
agriculture organization says 
baking bread with rice cassava maize barley millet or sorghum 
will give impoverished farmers new cash crops and provide an 
alternative to countries that cannot grow wheat or afford to import 
it the agency said thursday 
you can imagine what this will mean to countries like nigeria 
that banned imports of wheat several years ago for financial 
reasons said fao spokesman richard lydiker 
agency officials said the new method will not eliminate the need 
for food aid in countries that cant produce enough food or are 
struck by natural calamities such as flood or drought 
we are saying that other countries have the resources to be 
selfsufficient in this major food item and that this can help 
them said christian h bontefriedheim an assistant general 
director of the agency 
morton satin the official credited with developing the process 
said fao already is discussing it with sudan and nigeria he said 
countries such as cuba also have expressed interest 
fao gave reporters samples of the various breads baked with the 
new process the slices were tasty varied in color from white to 
the color of rye and had a texture similar to italian wheat bread 
agency officials said by baking the new breads developing 
countries can open new markets for local crops while reducing their 
dependence on food imports 
according to fao statistics the consumption of wheat in 
developing countries has increased steadily the past 40 years while 
consumption of local crops has declined 
the situation is complicated because wheat is often sold to 
developing countries at belowmarket prices or sent as food aid 
said satin who also is chief of faos food and agriculture 
industries service 
as a result the cost of wheat can be low and create a hurdle to 
agricultural development by discouraging domestic production of 
other foods crops that once produced excellent yields are being 
relegated to the role of subsistence crops 
bontefriedheim said the process also is seen as a way to stop 
the exodus of people from the rural areas to the cities in the 
developing world 
wheat can easily be made into bread because it has a major 
protein complex called vital wheat gluten that traps the gas 
necessary for bread 
the other grains lack that protein however satin discovered a 
mixture of water and flour made from one of those grains could be 
boiled to produce a thick gel that can trap the gases that gel is 
then mixed with more of the flour to produce a batter for bread

lackner of woodland hills calif and his company acris 
associates 
the action had been expected since jan 10 when the pentagon 
announced that lackner parkin and several other companies and 
individuals were being considered for suspension as a result of a 
federal indictment 
the indictment alleges that teledyne electronics and its 
employees paid parkin to obtain details about a navy radar contract 
worth more than 100 million parkin then paid lackner who in turn 
gave bribes to stuart berlin a navy contracting officer the

next week for crimes against humanity a court official said 
imre fintawas the first person to be charged by the government 
with war crimes he will be tried wednesday in a toronto court said

finta 77 a former restaurant owner in toronto was a captain in 
the hungarian mounted police during the war ms dayton said 
thursday 
he is accused of kidnapping and confining 8615 jews in the 
germanoccupied city of szeged in 1944 for transport out of the 
country causing the deaths of many in crowded trains 
finta faces four war crimes counts and four counts of crimes 
against humanity under war crimes legislation passed in 1987 
some of the testimony in the case will be taken from witnesses in 
hungary and israel because many of them are too old and frail to

a judge so overcome with emotion he had to leave 
the bench sided with the mother of a 12yearold cancer victim 
denying the fathers request for risky surgery that may not prolong 
the boys life 
this ruling cannot be read as a condemnation of one parent over 
the other cook county judge thomas j obrien said thursday 
the evidence was overwhelming that both are loving parents 
saying the boy is tragically too young to die obrien choked 
up after delivering his ruling and rushed from the bench to his 
chambers he returned soon afterward 
the ruling gives miriam soloveichik the authority to determine 
her sons medical treatment in accordance with doctors 
recommendations 
doctors at rush presbyterianst lukes medical center where 
yisroel soloveichik has been hospitalized since being diagnosed with 
brainstem cancer two years ago said he probably has less than two 
months to live 
moshe soloveichik 39 the boys father and an orthodox jewish 
rabbi had sought a surgical procedure to help drain fluid from the 
childs brain to relieve pressure 
the boy father felt surgery would prolong the boys life 
without exposing him to any prolonged suffering said howard 
london soloveichiks attorney 
doctors however said surgery could be risky and may not prolong 
his life 
soloveichik was very disappointed by the ruling but had not 
decided whether to appeal london said 
there are few winners in a case like this this is a genuine 
tragedy if there ever was one said christopher cohen the 
mothers attorney 
the only winner if there is one is the boy in that he will 
be allowed to die in comfortable surroundings 
the boy is on a respirator and fed intravenously he is unable to 
communicate or hear 
obriens ruling specifies that life support systems now in use 
are not to be withdrawn 
neither of the parents suggested withdrawing any existing 
lifesupport procedures this is not what is colloquially called a 
pulltheplug case cohen said 
there are no reported cases in the united states exactly like 
this with parents suing each other over medical treatment for a 
terminally ill child he added in a telephone interview after the 
ruling 
the chicago couple who have four other children and are still 
living together filed lawsuits against each other last week 
the father asked the court to give him sole custody of the boy so 
he could approve the surgery doctors at rush opposed it so 
soloveichik proposed having it performed at another hospital 
in her lawsuit mrs soloveichik sought to prohibit the surgery 
and keep the boy at rush 
the judge ruled in her favor against a transfer 
catherine ryan an attorney for the hospital called the ruling 
very thoughtful very caring and correct

uzi baram a top labor party official who 
opposed the centerleft partys coalition with the rightwing likud 
bloc has resigned from his party post labor officials said 
barams resignation as party secretarygeneral submitted 
thursday deepened a split in labor ranks and opened the way for a 
possible challenge to the leadership of longtime party head shimon 
peres 
baram strongly opposed peres decision last month to form a 
coalition with prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud insisting the 
leftleaning party should work in opposition to the government 
the daily jerusalem post said earlier this week that baram 
reflects the view of the very sizable minority in the party that 
labor has submerged its principles by becoming a junior partner in 
the government peres is finance minister in the new government 
some labor members have expressed dismay with the coalition 
agreement banning contacts with the palestine liberation 
organization the united states opened a dialogue with the plo last 
month after yasser arafat said he recognized the existence of israel 
and renounced terrorism 
the plo is viewed in israel as a terrorist group but some 
prominent labor doves including baram have said israel should 
recognize the political changes in the middle east since arafats 
recent statements and try to push forward the peace process 
baram the chief administrator of labor since 1984 had announced 
his intention to leave at a news conference shortly after the 
coalition government was formed 
the party said today it had scheduled a meeting of its 
1300member central council for feb 2 to elect a replacement for 
baram 
any challenge to peres leaderhip is not likely to emerge in the 
election for secretarygeneral however peres is supporting 
parliament member micha harish who announced earlier this week he 
also had the support of baram 
several potential candidates for the post dropped out to make way 
for harish parliament member ora namir from the most liberal wing 
of the party said earlier this week she was still deciding whether 
to contest for the post

two sisters separated since the russian 
revolution of 1917 reunited in a montreal airport and a relative 
said the look on their faces was worth a million dollars 
yetta izenwasser 93 said the reunion thursday with her 
82yearold sister from the soviet union leya lavit was among the 
happiest days in her life 
im so glad i lived long enough to see my sister again said 
mrs izenwasser seated in a wheelchair at the dorval airport 
terminal after 72 years i thought i would never see her again 
mrs izenwassers daughter ruth eisenberg said her mother was 
so nervous before driving to the airport that she needed medication 
to calm her 
and when they finally met ms eisenberg recounted they didnt 
say a word to each other but the expression on their faces was 
worth a million dollars 
mrs lavit of minsk received a visa this year from the soviet 
government to visit north america said her son mike lavit who 
lives in chicago and accompanied his mother to montreal 
mrs lavit who arrived in chicago on nov 13 flies back to 
minsk on feb 11 
she prepared for a long time what she would say and do but when 
she tried talking to her sister she started crying and couldnt 
talk mike lavit said a few hours later ms eisenberg said her 
mother and aunt were talking up a storm at her home in suburban 
laval 
she was astonished to hear that mrs lavit remembered mrs 
izenwassers old boyfriend in russia mrs lavit was only 10 years 
old when the czarist regime in russia fell during the march 1917 
revolution and her sister left for the united states

they came to look for landmines laid two 
decades ago but they found haunting reminders of slain friends and 
friendly encounters with old enemies 
bill johnson a 41yearold sign maker from manchester conn 
was among the six former us marines who returned to vietnam this 
week on a 10day goodwill tour 
he wept as he walked through cam lo and remembered the men he 
knew who died here in 1968 he was part of the 11th engineers a 
marine battalion that swept the highways of viet cong mines and 
planted their own to protect us bases 
he remembers narrowly missing a trip to cam lo 
fortunately for me we had gone on a detail to do some work and 
something fell on my foot and broke my toe said johnson 
it forced him to stay in the rear base at dong ha another 
sergeant took over for him as the marines swept highway 9 westward 
to cam lo where they stayed overnight 
that night a north vietnamese battalion attacked cam lo the 
first rocketpropelled grenades hit the squads truck around which 
the men were sleeping some died in the fire 
the string of us bases from which these marines operated was 
just below the former demilitarized zone that divided the warring 
north and south at the 17th parallel but the former marines five 
of them members of that battalion never got as far as the dmz until 
this week 
ever think youd be standing here asked nate genna a 
41yearold maintenance worker from boston 
no way brother replied gene spanos 39 a police lieutenant 
in rosemont ill as the two crossed the ben hai bridge that had 
divided the country until it was reunified in 1975 when the north 
won the war 
they were escorted by col ho minh thanh who during the war had 
tried to kill the marines by planting land mines on the highways 
they traveled 
he put them in we took them out said johnson he was 
putting in the mines at night that we were taking out in the morning 
in the road that was his speciality he said he was good at it 
were glad we were good at our work or we wouldnt be meeting each 
other today 
both the american people and the vietnamese people dont like 
war said thanh now we talk we dont want to fight each other 
again we want to be friends not enemies 
i dont feel any bitterness said johnson some veterans 
may probably some families who lost a son if you look at the 
reality these people were hurting as bad as we were i hope nobody 
back in the states looks negatively on our visit here 
at the government guesthouse in dong ha where the marines stayed 
children waited at the gate each day to cheer them as they left and 
as they returned 
and when the marines got out of their van and began retracing 
their steps northward reminiscing scores of children followed 
behind almost as if they were leading a parade 
mike wallace a 41yearold farmer from langdon kan brought 
with him a photo of a vietnamese woman and her infant son he had 
taken 20 years ago while building a road to con thien 
wallace had asked col thanh if the woman was still around 
sure enough thanh knew her well and led wallace and the other 
marines to her thatchedroof hut in chau hau village just off the 
dirt road 
there to his surprise and delight he was reunited with hoan thi 
chit 56 and her son now 25 they smiled and posed for pictures 
the son put his arm around wallaces waist 
but there was a bigger surprise as they left col thanh told 
him mrs chit had been his top viet cong agent 
the vietnamese colonel and the exmarine both laughed

the government today put the finishing touches on a 
budget proposal that includes the largest spending increase in eight 
years and more than 30 billion for defense 
under the finance ministrys proposal released thursday japan 
also would lead the world in aid to developing nations 
the proposal would raise total government spending by 66 percent 
to 46993 billion up from 441 billion in the initial budget for 
fiscal 1988 the largest rise since a 99 percent increase in 
fiscal 1981 
defense spending would rise to 3028 billion up 52 percent 
from the previous fiscal year but still below 1 percent of the 
estimated 1989 gross national product of 303 trillion 
defense spending in the current fiscal year amounted to 2878 
billion slightly more than 1 percent of japans projected gross 
national product the spending level ended japans 11year policy of 
limiting defense spending to less than 1 percent of the total value 
of the nations goods and services 
military spending is a sensitive issue in japan the constitution 
renounces war and use of force to settle international disputes the 
annual increase in japans defense spending has remained the same 
the last two years 
japan has been raising its defense spending under a program aimed 
at giving it the capability to repulse smallscale limited 
aggression in the case of a larger attack it would rely on help 
from the united states under their mutual defense treaty 
the united states has been urging japan to build up its defenses 
more quickly particularly its ability to protect vital sea lanes 
japan instead has assumed a greater share of the cost of 
maintaining us bases on its soil by 1990 it will pay more than 
half the budget proposal calls for a 16 percent increase over the 
previous year 109 billion 
japan also has sought to boost its aid to developing nations 
in formulating the draft budget the ministry paid close 
attention to the relationship between the growth rate of japans 
overseas development assistance and its defense spending a senior 
finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity 
japans total proposed spending on aid to developing countries is 
expected to reach 10 billion in fiscal 1988 and hit 11 billion in 
fiscal 1989 he said 
according to estimates by the organization for economic 
cooperation and development both figures put japan ahead of the 
united states as the largest donor of aid to developing countries 
the foreign ministry is expected to lobby for greater aid in budget 
negotiations beginning today the official said 
after negotiations with its agencies the government is expected 
to adopt a budget proposal based on the finance ministrys draft on 
tuesday the budget usually is passed by parliament in february the 
fiscal year begins april 1 
due to differing fiscal years and accounting techniques it is 
difficult to draw direct comparisons between foreign aid budgets 
the 145 billion us foreign aid proposal for the fiscal year 
starting oct 1 includes military aid 
japans aid budget includes no military expenditures 
in 1987 japan spent 745 billion in development assistance up 
323 percent from a year earlier and was second to the united 
states which extended 878 billion in such assistance 
measured against the size of its economy japans aid is not 
outstandingly generous this year it will be about 03 percent of 
the gross national product higher than the us rate of 023 
percent but below the average of 036 percent among major western 
donor nations

himself while in police custody in el dorado county in april 1987

admitted taking part in an armored car robbery will never be allowed 
to return to the college where even lying is punishable by 
expulsion a spokesman said 
right now theyre simply on administrative leave vmi

resign if they came back they would be dismissed by the honor 
court 
the 150yearold college reknowned for its strict discipline 
convenes an honor court that has just one sanction expulsion for 
any student found to have lied cheated or stolen

weights and appeared to be good cadets 
for the most part everyones shocked said gray riddick a 
junior i knew one of them smals personally he didnt seem like 
a person who would be a robber id say hes kind of quiet but he 
seemed nice he just seemed normal to me 
i knew jasinski quite well said david martin a senior he 
was a model student his appearance was excellent he was one of the 
friendliest guys youd ever meet 
neither student was involved much in extracurricular affairs 
joynes said 
smals was a good student a sophomore studying english on a navy 
scholarship he said he characterized jasinski as a cstudent who 
was a fifthyear senior studying mechanical engineering 
joynes said that about four or five of the schools 1300 male 
students are thrown out for honor code violations each year most 
are caught lying about such things as where they were at a certain 
time he said 
stealing is rare joynes said i doubt weve had one of 
those in 10 years

an iranian spiritual leader called for an 
end to battles in lebanon between rival shiite moslem militiamen 
backed by iran and syria saying the fighting is sinful irans 
official news agency said today 
the call from the ayatollah hussein ali montazeri designated 
successor to iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini came as 
police said the rival militias skirmished briefly in south beiruts 
slums wounding three people 
the syrianbacked amal militia and the proiranian hezbollah or 
party of god clashed with rocketpropelled grenades and machine 
guns for two hours thursday night in the haret hreik bourj 
elbarajneh and hajjaj districts police said 
the casualties raised the overall toll to 168 killed and 318 
wounded since dec 31 when the two militias began fighting in 
beirut and southern lebanon 
the two factions have been locked in a power struggle for control 
of lebanons 1 million shiites the countrys largest single sect 
since april more than 500 people have been killed and 1500 wounded 
in that period 
montazeri said the lebanese clashes are clearly haram sin and 
against divine sharia islamic law according to islamic republic 
news agency monitored in nicosia cyprus 
montazeri said it was logically and religiously incumbent on 
any faction and power that believes in islam and jihad holy war in 
the path of god to try to put out the flame of this bloody 
fighting 
most of the casualties since dec 31 have been in southern 
lebanon near israels selfproclaimed security zone a strip of 
land north of the border israel established the zone in 1985 after 
withdrawing the bulk of its troops from lebanon following a

the communist party daily pravda today paid tribute 
to ronald reagan saying he conducted the presidency his best 
role with a mixture of ideology and realism that led to 
substantive improvements in sovietus relations 
correspondent gennady vasiliev wrote that the man who in 1983 
called the soviet union an evil empire was according to all 
external indications leaving office as a completely successful 
political figure 
pravdas article provided graphic evidence of the changes that 
have taken place in the soviet unions official view of reagan as 
his administration and the kremlin under president mikhail s 
gorbachev moved toward arms control agreements and a lessening of 
tensions 
vasiliev wrote that reagan had not managed to reduce the size of 
government that he increased the federal deficit and spent more 
than 2 trillion on the military while failing to gain military 
superiority over the soviet union 
but he credited reagan with lowering inflation and unemployment 
and setting the united states on one of its most prolonged periods 
of economic growth 
one paradoxes of the reagan administration was improved relations 
with the soviet union despite the presidents tough anticommunist 
stand pravda said 
as reagans term progressed it became all the more clear that 
reagan was somewhat more of a realist than could be judged from his 
speeches especially of the first years of his presidency the 
article said 
reagan gradually replaced the ideologues he brought with him to 
washington in 1981 with pragmatists including secretary of state 
george shultz it said 
reagan and shultz showed realism the ability to reject 
habitual stereotypes in the name of movement toward agreement it 
said 
reagan vasiliev wrote according to the general view was not 
distinguished by the strong intellect of roosevelt the broad 
education of kennedy or even carters capacity for work 
but his opponents time and again underestimated him and reagan 
was leaving office a popular and successful president he wrote 
during his years as an actor reagan did not get many leading 
roles and often played the second or third part in his movies 
vasiliev said 
however he got the countrys leading political role and now 
summing up the results of his eightyear presidency i would like to 
ask wasnt this ronald reagans best role

the state supreme court is questioning 
evidence in the murders of a schoolteacher and her two children 
which turned up during the trial of her principal but was withheld 
until two years after his conviction 
the court on thursday ordered dauphin county court here to hold a 
hearing on the evidence involving former principal jay c smith who 
faces the electric chair for the 1979 slayings of teacher susan 
reinert and her two children 
the highly publicized case inspired the bestseller echoes in 
the darkness and a television miniseries of the same name 
now we have an opportunity in court under oath to find out 
what the history is of this thing said smiths attorney william 
costopoulos this opens the door 
costopoulos said the handling of the evidence represented a 
coverup and asked the court to overturn the conviction on the basis 
of prosecutorial miconduct 
prosecutors allege the material was planted by someone who wanted 
to help smith 
in its 81 vote the supreme court ordered the county court to 
try to determine whether the evidence was real how it got into a 
state police evidence drawer whether it was withheld and whether 
smith received a fair trial because he wasnt told about it 
the evidence consists of two adhesive strips containing quartz 
particles reportedly removed from mrs reinerts feet during an 
autopsy 
the attorney generals office said the evidence was found in the 
state police drawer during the last week of smiths 1986 trial but 
smith and costopoulos werent told about it until last summer 
smith claims the evidence was withheld because it would have 
supported his contention that mrs reinert was slain at the new 
jersey shore by another teacher who was her lover william bradfield 
quartz is found in beach sand and its presence on the body could 
indicate she had been at the shore the weekend she died 
bradfield was also convicted of the murders he is serving a life 
prison term 
besides the courts investigation state police and dauphin 
county district attorney richard lewis are investigating the origins 
of the adhesive strips 
still pending before the supreme court is an appeal of smiths 
conviction on other grounds 
mrs reinert a teacher at merion high school outside 
philadelphia was found in the trunk of her car in the parking lot 
of a suburban harrisburg hotel the bodies of her children karen 
11 and michael 10 were never found

the main plutoniumhandling operation at the 
troubled rocky flats nuclear weapons plant will be restarted in 
stages within 45 days the department of energy announced 
the federal agency on thursday gave rockwell international which 
operates the government permission for the restart officials said 
approval came after department officials verified that the agency 
and rockwell had complied with a schedule for improvements of 
equipment and procedures 
building 771 which was shut down last fall after three people 
were exposed to plutonium is the main structure for processing the 
plutonium used to manufacture triggers for nuclear weapons at the 
plant near here 
two rockwell employees and an energy department inspector 
inadvertently walked into a restricted area in the building where 
the potential for airborne radioactive contamination existed sept 
29 the building was shut down oct 8 for an investigation and 
improvements officials said although the actual exposure for the 
trio was below federal limits 
the restart will occur over the next 30 to 45 days the 
department said 
while the building was shut down the energy department conducted 
a semiannual inventory of nuclear materials and reviewed 
contamination controls monitoring programs and work practices and 
46 other actions were taken to improve safety and operations 
we used that time very constructively to fix a lot of things 
to clean the building lower background radiation levels 
rockwell spokesman dennis hurtt said 
bruce twining of the energy department said the federal agency 
and private contractor learned a lot from the episode and it will 
enable us to make continuous progress in the future on 
environmental safety and health issues as well as maintain our 
production commitments 
plutonium a poisonous and highly radioactive artificially formed 
substance is used in the triggers of nuclear weapons it is 
fissionable and has a halflife of 24000 years which means it 
loses onehalf its radioactivity in 240 centuries 
the plutonium processing and trigger assembly are done at rocky 
flats but the assembly of the actual nuclear bombs is done 
elsewhere in the nations nuclear weapons complex other parts of 
the system including the savannah river plant near aiken sc and 
the feed materials production center have experienced environmental 
or safety problems 
rocky flats was targeted by a recent congressional study for 
eventual shutdown with transfer of its operations elsewhere 
officials say if that does occur it would take many years to 
accomplish and then clean up the site

vietnam said today that talks with china on peace 
in wartorn cambodia occurred in a friendly atmosphere and 
announced the foreign ministers of the two countries would meet soon 
a vietnamese spokesman said first deputy foreign minister dinh 
nho liem returned to vietnam today after five days of negotiations 
in beijing 
the visit which both sides initially tried to keep secret was 
the first of a highranking vietnamese official to china in nine 
years 
liem discussed vietnams 10year occupation of cambodia with 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen and vice foreign minister liu 
shuqing 
they also discussed normalization of relations between the two 
countries and other issues of concern said a statement from a 
vietnamese spokesman relations between the two socialist countries 
have been hostile since vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 to 
drive the prochinese khmer rouge from power 
the exchange of views between the two sides was useful and took 
place in a frank and friendly atmosphere the vietnamese spokesman 
said speaking on condition of anonymity the two sides reached a 
number of agreements the remaining questions will be discussed 
later 
the statement said vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach 
will be meeting soon with qian it did not give a specific date 
the vietnamese embassy refused to elaborate on what agreements 
had been reached and the chinese foreign ministry declined to 
comment on the alleged meeting and results of the talks 
the vietnamese spokesman said china and vietnam discussed the 
international aspects of the conflict in cambodia 
china has previously said it would not begin talks with vietnam 
until hanoi moves to end its occupation of cambodia 
but last week a top cambodian resistance official said china at 
the request of the soviet union had agreed to talk to vietnam on 
the condition that moscow opens direct talks with cambodian 
resistance leader grince norodom sihanouk 
in the 1960s and mid70s china provided major assistance for 
north vietnams war against the united states and south vietnam 
but chinas relations with vietnam have been cold since late 1978 
when vietnam toppled the khmer rouge in cambodia the ultraradical 
khmer rouge had ruled cambodia since 1975 in a bloody reign that 
left at least one million dead 
beijing attacked vietnam in early 1979 to punish it for its 
invasion of cambodia talks between the two countries were cut off 
in december 1979 
beijing now arms guerrillas opposing vietnams occupation of 
cambodia one of the guerrilla groups is the khmer rouge 
on jan 7 china said a vietnamese proposal to withdraw all of 
its troops from cambodia by september was a step forward 
previously vietnam facing serious economic problems at home had 
set a target of 1990 for leaving cambodia 
but vietnam still insists on measures to prevent the khmer rouge 
from returning to power chinahhas refused to exclude the khmer 
rouge from a future cambodian government but has said it is willing 
to reduce its assistance to the khmer rouge and other guerrillas 
forces as vietnam pulls out 
vietnam claims it has made partial troop withdrawals each year 
since 1982 but china says vietnam actually has only rotated forces 
in and out 
vietnam says it has about 50000 troops in cambodia western 
diplomats in beijing say the actual number is far larger

at least one in five american men has had one 
or more homosexual experiences and at least 33 percent have such 
sexual contacts regularly a national research council study says 
published today in the magazine science the study suggests that 
the number of american men who have had at least one homosexual 
experience is lower than the estimates compiled some 40 years ago by 
famed sex researcher alfred kinsey 
but charles f turner an nrc scientist and coauthor of the new 
study said the current estimates are the lowest possible numbers 
he said there are still not enough data to establish a true number 
which in all likelihood would be higher 
all of the estimates that we have made are lowerbound 
estimates turner said thursday in a telephone interview these 
numbers are best treated as a minimum were not saying what the 
true number is but only that this is the best that can be done in 
terms of setting a lower bound 
he said the uncertainty is the result of the assumed tendency of 
surveyed men to be untruthful about homosexual experiences 
because of what we know about the history of societal 
oppression of gay men there is very considerable reason to believe 
that a number of men will conceal experiences that they have had 
turner said 
he said more research is needed in part to assess the progress 
of the epidemic of aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
homosexual males are a major risk group for the fatal disease an 
nrc study on this issue will be released next month said turner 
who is director for the nrc committee on aids research 
estimates in the current study include 
a minimum of 203 percent of american males who were 21 years or 
older in 1970 had a samegender sex experience to orgasm at some 
point in their lives 
a minimum of 67 percent had such sexual experiences after the 
age of 20 
in frequency of such experiences after the age of 20 the study 
estimated a minimum percentage of 18 for rarely 19 for 
occasionally and 14 percent for fairly often this puts a 
total of 33 percent in the two most frequent categories of contact 
turner said one problem with trying to determine the number of 
homosexual men in society is defining precisely what a gay man is 
many more men have had a single homosexual encounter than are 
habitually and preferentially homosexual he said 
kinsey who conducted sex research from 1938 to 1949 recognized 
the problem of defining homosexuality and developed a sixpoint 
scale based on the frequency of homosexual contacts the kinsey 
study found that at least 37 percent of the population have had some 
homosexual experience and that at least 10 percent of the male 
population was more or less exclusively homosexual for three 
years between the ages 16 to 55 
turner said the new study cannot be simplistically compared 
to the kinsey studies 
he said a population analysis also suggests that the 33 percent 
of adult male population with the most frequent homosexual contact 
could not be exclusively homosexual a term used by kinsey 
most of the men included in our 33 percent estimate could not 
be classified as exclusively homosexual throughout their lives 
because a large percentage of them were married at some point in 
their life turner said 
the new estimates are derived from an analysis of data collected 
from 3018 adults in 1970 by the kinsey institute for sex research 
in indiana along with some data from a 1988 survey by the national 
opinion research center 
coauthors on the report with turner were robert e fay an nrc 
consultant albert d klassen of the university of north dakota and 
john h gagnon of the state university of new york at stony brook 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

between 100 and 200 aftershocks have 
rattled the los angeles area since a mild earthquake sent quivers 
through the region earlier this week seismologists say 
however hall daily a spokesman for the california institute of 
technology said thursday that the number of aftershocks was not 
terribly unusual 
many aftershocks were too small to measure said cal tech 
seismologist lucile jones but two of the larger ones thursday 
afternoon were strong enough to be felt in several areas including 
downtown los angeles 
the two shocks one at 202 pm and the other at 209 pm 
tentatively measured 37 and 35 on the richter scale of ground 
motion and were the largest daily said the main quake wednesday 
measured 50 on the richter scale 
there has been a sharp increase in the number of earthquakes in 
southern california during the past few months but one expert said 
that was no cause for alarm 
douglas givens of the us geological survey said about 60 quakes 
per month about triple the average have struck the area since 
september most of them too small to feel 
its very difficult to say whether this particular increase is 
significant or not givens said from a statistical point of 
view a good bet would mean that a significant event would not 
follow 
wednesdays quake centered eight miles off the malibu coast in 
santa monica bay caused five minor injuries and briefly knocked out 
power to 100000 people 
it was the third quake in less than three months to strike the 
los angeles area with more than a 40magnitude a quake in 
huntington beach measured 47 in november a pasadenacentered quake 
in december also measured 50 
the strongest recent shaker was the deadly whittier narrows quake 
of oct 1 1987 which measured 59 on the richter scale that quake 
and its 53magnitude aftershock on oct 4 killed eight people 
injured more than 200 and caused 358 million in damage

children have borne the brunt of the 198889 
influenza season so far but federal fluwatchers say its too early 
to tell what the impact will be on older people for whom the 
illness can be dangerous 
type b influenza one of the three major families of flu 
viruses has now been reported in 23 states from california to new 
york the us centers for disease control reported thursday 
influenza b has predominated with most reported illnesses 
occurring among children the atlantabased agency said in its 
weekly report 
elderly people and those with certain medical problems are most 
likely to suffer serious complications and even death from flu 
the impact that this years influenza b activity will have on 
older persons and persons at high risk is unknown the cdc 
said 
however each type b flu epidemic since 1979 has caused higher 
than expected levels of death the report noted thus efforts to 
immunize highrisk persons in all age groups should continue even as 
outbreaks begin 
of the laboratoryconfirmed flu cases reported to the cdc this 
winter 81 percent have been type b flu and four fullblown flu 
outbreaks have so far been linked to type b in elementary schools 
in ohio nebraska california and the state of washington 
in contrast the two other major types which researchers know as 
ah1n1 and ah3n2 have been reported in 11 and four states 
respectively with only one outbreak between them an ah1n1 
outbreak at a college in wisconsin last month 
the recommended us flu vaccine for the winter of 198889 
contains protection against all three major flu types specifically 
against a type b strain known as the victoria flu type ah3n2 
sichuan flu and type ah1n1 taiwan flu those were seen late last 
winter and were considered by health officials to be most likely to 
spread this winter 
cdc researchers dont yet know specifically what kind of type b 
flu is hitting the united states this winter said dr robert 
cannon a cdc flu specialist 
since it is hitting hard among children we assume that its 
closely related enough to a strain from recent winters that older 
adults have seen it before and therefore may have some immunity 
to it he said 
the 23 states which have so far reported type b flu to the cdc 
are new york west virginia ohio kentucky tennessee georgia 
florida mississippi louisiana texas oklahoma missouri iowa 
michigan wisconsin nebraska new mexico arizona utah idaho

fire damage at yellowstone national park 
last summer was not as bad as most people think the parks chief 
scientist said in a defense of the let it burn policy 
the longterm effects will favor not only existing wildlife 
but wildlife diversity john varley said thursday as the american 
association for the advancement of science ended its annual meeting 
varley and other researchers said last summers conflagration was 
part of a natural cycle and caused less damage than many people 
believed 
we expect to see regeneration beginning next spring and 
vegetation will flourish in three to five years he said wildlife 
losses were light varley added and included only 250 of 32000 
summering elk and nine of 2700 bison 
people grew up with smokey bear and bambi and believe all fire 
is bad varley said but there is recognition among the agencies 
and scientific community that fire is as important as soil sunlight 
and water in maintaining our favorite park landscapes 
biologist william romme of fort lewis college in durango colo 
reconstructed a history of fires since 1685 in a large part of the 
park and concluded the 1988 blazes were a nearly natural event in 
the ecological history of yellowstone 
since the national park service abandoned total fire suppression 
in 1976 it combats humancaused fires but only those lightning 
blazes that threaten human life homes and villages special natural 
features or threatened or endangered species 
varney said he favored continuation of that policy as well as 
setting small intentional or prescribed fires to prevent fuel 
buildup near park entrances and villages 
varley said the fires that raged for two months last summer 
affected 138 million acres or 115 percent of the 12millionacre 
yellowstone ecosystem which includes surrounding national forest 
land 
of the 22millionacre park itself flames affected 995000 
acres or 46 percent he said 
the perception that half of yellowstone was devastated is far 
from the truth varley said 
soil scientists and plant ecologists tell us well over 99 
percent of the fires burned to only light or moderate intensity 
damaging the uppermost inch of soil and leaving roots and bulbs 
unharmed he said

died after a call for emergency medical aid apparently was not 
followed up officials say 
john patterson was pronounced dead thursday after arriving at 
greater southeast community hospital in full cardiac arrest 
officials with the district of columbias fire and ambulance 
services said an unidentified relative drove patterson about five 
blocks from this home to a fire station where an ambulance crew 
provided first aid 
officials said a preliminary investigation indicated that a call 
was made from the patterson home to the 911 emergency number seeking 
help however they said medical technicians were not aware of the 
emergency until the relative asked for help in person 
the districts fire department has been plagued in recent years 
by problems involving ambulance service including slow response 
times dispatching errors and poor training 
following repeated problems the ambulance service was removed 
from fire department administrative control last february although 
it still relies on the departments communications center and other 
facilities alfred became fire chief in december

israeli authorities closed all 1200 schools in 
the west bank today in a move to halt growing protests in the 
occupied territory where two suspected collaborators reportedly 
were shot to death 
the indefinite suspension of classes for 300000 palestinian 
youngsters came little more than a month after schools were reopened 
after a 10month closure also aimed at halting the palestinian 
uprising 
after schools began reopening in december israeli authorities 
warned they would be shut again if they became staging areas for 
antiisraeli protests in the past week 89 schools were ordered 
closed for limited periods 
a spokesman for the military government of the west bank said 
government officials met with parents students and local leaders in 
the past few days to warn them that continued violence would lead to 
another blanket closure 
the closure is to prevent clashes and minimize the number of 
casualties among students the spokeswoman said reading from a 
statement 
palestinian human rights groups have contended that school 
closures are illegal under local and international law including 
the 1949 geneva convention which protects civilians under military 
occupation 
in the west bank merchants shuttered their shops for a third 
straight day today to protest an upsurge in palestinian deaths 
blamed on tougher army policies that allow troops to open fire more 
freely 
defense minister yitzhak rabin detailing some of the new 
regulations said troops now are allowed to fire plastic bullets at 
palestinians erecting roadblocks or fleeing a protest israel radio 
said 
rabin also outlined a peace plan that proposes elections and some 
form of autonomy for the occupied lands in exchange for a ceasefire 
in the 13month palestinian uprising 
a foreign ministry spokesman said today that the proposal 
reflected rabins personal opinion and not government policy the 
government peace plan is still being prepared said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in the occupied gaza strip today two palestinian teenagers were 
reported wounded by gunfire in the jabaliya refugee camp 
the army said it was checking the reported injuries it confirmed 
the death of a suspected collaborator in the west bank village of 
atil and said it was checking whether a second alleged collaborator 
died of earlier injuries 
the victim in atil ahmed jeredat 36 was killed thursday night 
when he was shot in the eye arab reporters said they said soldiers 
immediately imposed a curfew on the village 
jeredat owned a store that sold forms to the military government 
that palestinians need to travel overseas 
after the slaying troops raided atil and ordered males ages 12 
to 40 to report to the village school for questioning the reports 
said three residents were arrested 
a second suspected collaborator mohammed irut 18 died today at 
ramallah hospital hospital officials said irut was shot in the 
head jan 12 in the west bank city of nablus 
more than a dozen palestinians suspected of cooperating with 
israel have been killed since december 1987 such attacks have been 
ordered in leaflets distributed by proplo uprising leaders 
since the uprising began 365 palestinians have been killed in 
the uprising fifteen israelis also have died in the unrest

government workers armed with electric cattle 
prods and tear gas beat and shocked members of the official 
communist youth league who were holding a special street sale of 
scarce items it was alleged today 
news of the incident in the city of chengdu first appeared in an 
article today in the official china youth news 
a league official yang ling told the associated press by 
telephone from chengdu that one of the victims had an electric prod 
applied to his head and cannot speak clearly or raise one arm 
ms yang said the attack occurred dec 30 and led to a sitin 
demonstration by youth league members at chengdu city offices 
chengdu is the capital of sichuan province 
the china youth news story was unusual because chinese papers 
rarely run indepth accounts of official brutality an article 
earlier this week in the peoples daily acknowledged that torture 
and forced confessions do occur but unlike todays report it gave 
no details 
the article was an indication china is facing serious problems of 
public order resulting from its current economic difficulties 
a price reform program along with official corruption has 
resulted in chinas highest inflation since the communist revolution 
in 1949 inflation was officially 19 percent last year but its 
actual level could be twice that 
the league has demanded legal action be taken against the 
government workers who allegedly participated in the attack the 
case is under investigation 
the china youth news article said officials from a city 
inspection team responsible for overseeing economic activity in 
chengdu joined in the attack 
the report based on six eyewitness accounts said 40 members of 
the team wielding electric prods handcuffs and tear gas burst 
into the crowd shortly after 11 am and stopped a special sale of 
300 hardtoget products including poultry fish soy sauce and 
spirits 
the sale was organized by the youth league of the chinese 
communist party league members in the citys commerce department 
informed the city government of the sale but had yet to receive 
permission to put it on the report said 
ms yang said league members had assumed the government would 
approve the sale since it was designed to help the people 
according to the report soon after the sale began the inspection 
bureau ordered it halted 
members of the inspection team arrived on the scene and 
violently suppressed the sale the paper said 
four league members were arrested they were released later that 
day after a highranking communist party official intervened the 
report said

if those holding nine americans hostage in 
lebanon ever want to send a signal to the us government this is 
an opportunity let those people go a former captive said eight 
years to the day after he was released by iran 
the release of those hostages would be a magnificent signal 
would be something that i think would trigger all manner of things 
here in this new administration said l bruce laingen who was in 
charge of the us embassy in tehran when it was stormed on nov 3 
1979 
laingen recalled during an interview on abcs good morning 
america the release of himself and 51 other american hostages on 
ronald reagans inauguration day in 1980 after 444 days of captivity 
but he said today is not the day to remember us its a day 
to remember nine americans who are denied their freedom in beirut 
he noted that terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press has been a captive almost four years far 
longer than any of us he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
and i would say this morning to those who hold them and to 
those governments who can influence them if they ever wanted to 
send a signal to this government at a time of change in the middle 
east this is an opportunity let those people go 
laingen said incoming president bush is not going to make 
concessions to terrorists but george bush like all of us today i 
think are open to change in the middle east 
president reagan said thursday he was frustrated over his 
inability to free the american hostages we dont know where they 
are he said but officials were continuing to explore quietly 
and privately how to win their freedom

the giant cake that air force stewards served 
george p shultz on his last official flight bore the message 
stenciled in ice cream thanks for the memory 
over 6 years of traveling 880941 miles with the secretary of 
state to 74 countries stewards staff and the regulars in the press 
corps came to know him a little bit better than most people 
they will retain memorable experiences of visits to the kremlin 
to the taj mahal the holy city of jerusalem the colorful capital 
of soviet georgia tbilisi 
they found him to be a cautious man but not without emotion he 
made himself accessible to the media on almost every flight and 
broke precedent by putting his remarks on the record 
they saw shultz fail to entice palestinian arabs into 
negotiations with israel or even to talk to him a memorable 
portrait was shultz standing alone in a moonlit courtyard in east 
jerusalem waiting in vain for a dozen palestinians who dared not 
risk the disfavor of the palestine liberation organization by 
accepting his invitiation 
shultz was willing to risk being stood up in public in the 
interest of promoting mideast peace talks it was a risk of 
embarrassment that not many secretaries of state would have taken 
shultz made five trips to the middle east in 1988 alone each 
time warning israel and the arabs that the status quo was dangerous 
each time he was rebuffed but his spirits were not dampened i 
think there is a lot of possibility there and to a certain extent 
the groundwork is work that we did he said on his last trip to 
vienna last sunday 
still israel remains besieged in a hostile arab world while the 
west bank and gaza seethe with palestinian unrest the proliferation 
of ballistic missiles in the region and suspicions that iraq libya 
and syria either have or are capable of producing chemical or 
biological weapons compound the dangers 
shultz had other failures too the agreement he worked out with 
lebanon and israel in 1983 fell apart under syrian pressure he 
objected to secret us arms sales to iran in 1985 but was unable 
to deter president reagan and the national security council some 
critics said shultz did not fight hard enough especially since the 
missile deliveries undercut his campaign against terrorism or that 
he should have resigned in protest when he lost out 
his successes outnumbered the setbacks though 
despite the irancontra scandal shultz managed to carry the 
banner against terrorism to new heights alerting initially bemused 
western leaders to the danger and he championed human rights 
shultz took time on his trips to moscow to meet with jews and 
other dissidents he attended a passover seder in the us embassy 
and saw to it that leading refuseniks were invited 
gradually under a modern soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the doors swung open jewish emigration is at a nineyear high more 
than 600 political prisoners have been released more than 100 
divided families have been permitted to reunite 
i think the things i feel the best about had to do with the 
area of human rights shultz said on the flight to vienna and 
the one incident that always sticks with me is the day i had a phone 
call from ida nudel saying im home i still tingle a little as i 
think about it 
the longtime jewish refusenik was issued an exit permit for 
israel under us pressure and had called shultz from jerusalem 
after her arrival 
apart from human rights his most lasting achievement was to 
recognize the change in moscow after gorbachevs ascent to power in 
april 1985 and to play a leading role within the reagan 
administration in responding to soviet arms control overtures 
shultz worked out a close relationship with eduard a 
shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister in 31 meetings they made 
arrangements for five superpower summit meetings and worked out ways 
to reduce regional tensions the soviet red army is withdrawing from 
afghanistan cuban troops are leaving angola and the vietnamese are 
pulling out of cambodia 
shultzs impact on us foreign policy depends partly on how much 
the bush administration follows the pattern or changes it james a 
baker iii shultzs designated successor voiced reservations at his 
senate confirmation hearing to a human rights conference in moscow 
and said negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear weapons would be 
delayed to review the bidding 
but as presidentelect bush himself has said the genie is out 
of the bottle ussoviet relations are in a new phase and for 
that shultz is as responsible as anyone

communist north korea and apologized for past crimes an 
allusion to its brutal colonization of the korean peninsula earlier

however he said it was not certain if a meeting would occur 
between government officials and the fourmember north korean 
delegation 
a policy statement released by the northeast asia division also 
said the government and people of japan are profoundly aware that 
past actions by japan have inflicted great suffering on the peoples 
of nearby lands

what happened and our determination that it shall never happen 
again

world war ii it was divided into the communist north and capitalist 
south in 1945

which denounced japans attitude toward pyongyang the capital of 
north korea and demanded an apology for past crimes 
japan has no intention of supporting the perpetuation of 
division desired by neither north nor south the japanese 
statement said 
japan does not maintain hostile policy toward north korea and 
we recognize that it will be appropriate for us to move 
positively toward improved relations between japan and north korea 
north and south korea have recently exchanged a flurry of 
proposals heralding the first major peace offensive aimed at 
officially ending four decades of confrontation that included the 
195053 korean war

israeli and egyptian negotiators are moving 
toward an agreement under which egypt would regain control of the 
disputed border strip of taba a popular winter resort officials 
said today 
the israeli foreign ministry said in a statement the first round 
of talks which concluded today were intensive and 
constructive the talks are to resume in the next for days the 
statement said 
ministry spokesman alon liel told israel radio an agreement was 
emerging in which israeli tourists would be allowed to visit taba 
without a special permit or entry taxes if the 250acre strip were 
returned to egyptian sovereignty 
israel has controlled the tiny red sea resort since the 1967 
middle east war and an israeliowned 41 million hotel complex 
there has become a favorite winter vacation spot 
egypt has demanded return of the land and the dispute has been a 
sore point between the nations for the past six years 
it began when israel refused to hand over taba in 1982 when it 
left the sinai peninsula under terms of the usbrokered 
israeliegypt peace treaty 
the issue went to international arbitration and in september a 
fivemember panel in geneva awarded the border pillar closest to the 
resort to egypt but the tribunal said it had no power to decide the 
final border demarcation line 
the current talks are aimed at defining the border if egypt 
prevails the hotel will be in its territory 
other issues include entry procedures for israelis and foreign 
tourists and a plan for egypt to purchase the hotel 
israel has demanded that its citizens have reasonable access to 
the site 
a sixmember us team headed by state department legal adviser 
abraham sofaer has been mediating at the talks 
nabil el arabi head of the egyptian delegation told reporters 
on thursday we would like israeli tourists to come here not only 
by the tens of thousands but by the tens and hundreds of thousands

least a month to recuperate from a stroke and doctors are likely to 
tell him next week whether he can return to work or should retire 
newspapers reported today 
botha on thursday named constitutional development minister chris 
heunis the seniorranking cabinet member as acting president 
neither botha nor other government leaders has indicated how long 
heunis will serve as acting president 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper said botha 73 would 
need at least a month to recuperate its report was based on 
comments from an unidentified government source and an unidentified 
neurosurgeon 
the star the countrys largest daily said without citing 
sources that doctors will probably decide by next week whether 
botha will be fit enough to resume office or whether he should 
retire 
bothas office did not comment on the reports but issued a 
statement from doctors saying his left arm and leg which were 
weakend by the stroke had improved markedly 
the president received several visitors today and was in a 
cheerful mood his office said 
botha in charge of south africas government since 1978 has 
refused to comment on his possible retirement 
heunis and other cabinet members met today with the namibian 
cabinet in cape town south africa which has ruled namibia for 74 
years is to begin implementing independence in the territory in 
april leading to elections in november heunis said in a statement 
that the talks were frank and took place in a spirit of mutual 
understanding 
he said discussions focused on how the transitional government 
will be phased out prior to the elections the multiracial cabinet 
is made up of namibians but they are under louis pienaar a south 
african who serves as administrator general 
heunis 61 was acting president for several days last year while 
botha visited europe 
if botha does not resume his duties the cabinet would elect a 
new president 
he suffered the stroke at his home wednesday and was taken to a 
military hospital in the cape town suburb of wynberg 
doctors said thursday that his left arm and left leg were 
weakened by the stroke but his facial muscles and speaking ability 
were not affected 
in his cabinet post heunis has been assigned the task of 
developing a constitutional format that would give blacks limited 
power in the whiterun government 
most prominent black leaders have refused to negotiate with 
heunis 
there had been reports in recent months that botha planned to 
replace heunis because of his inability to persuade black leaders to 
participate in negotiations 
also heunis only barely won reelection to parliament in 1987 
when he was challenged by denis worrall who quit as south africas 
ambassador to britain to run as an independent 
those mentioned as presidential contenders include foreign 
minister pik botha who is not related to the president national 
education minister fw de klerk and defense minister magnus malan 
as prime minister and later as president botha pushed through 
the first significant racial reforms undertaken during the national 
partys 40year rule such as legalization of black trade unions and 
abolition of pass laws that restricted blacks movements 
but he has refused to discuss the possibility of a oneperson 
onevote system in south africa where the 5 million whites control 
the government and economy and the 26 million blacks have no say in 
national affairs

president reagans farewell from office today produced 
celebrations by nicaraguas sandinista government a gift horse from 
canada and thanks from british prime minister margaret thatcher to a 
true and perfect gentleman 
in the soviet union the communist party daily pravda published a 
lengthy article titled reagans best role that credited reagan 
with becoming more of a realist than an ideologue as his term 
progressed 
correspondent gennady vasiliev noted that reagan according to 
the general view was not distinguished by the strong intellect of 
roosevelt the broad education of kennedy or even carters capacity 
for work 
but his opponents time and again underestimated him vasiliev 
said and reagan was leaving office a popular and successful 
president 
the japan times hailed reagan as the man of the decade and 
an australian newspaper called him a hard act to follow 
in the netherlands the rotterdam newspaper algemeen dagblad said 
the united states found a muchwanted anchor in reagans 
straightforwardly conservative ideology of patriotism military 
might and economic recovery 
in managua however the leftist nicaraguan government planned 
parties and parades to usher out reagan whose administration 
financed antigovernment rebels since 1981 and in jordan plo 
official khaled alhassan called reagan an illiterate who knew 
nothing about international problems 
the workers will show their ingenuity to mock imperialism and 
the reactionaries in this country the state voice of nicaragua 
said thursday 
the nicaraguan government said it hoped normal relations with the 
united states could be restored after george bush took office 
alhassan agreed saying bush knows a lot a knowlegeable man 
with consultants is more useful than an illiterate with 
consultants 
in yugoslavia the leading daily politika said today that 
reagan will be remembered as an unmatched political seducer 
whose rhetoric bush will never be able to match 
west berlins mayor eberhard diepgen sent reagan a letter of 
thanks for his demand that the berlin wall be torn down 
your impressive words during the event of the 750th anniversary 
of berlin before the brandenburg gate when you so forcefully 
demanded overcoming the division and tearing down the wall remain a 
special memory for berliners the letter said 
while bush takes over the reins of power reagan plans to saddle 
a gift from the royal canadian mounted police 
reagan put the cart before the horse wednesday when he announced 
the gift would be sent to his ranch near santa barbara calif 
canada delayed confirming it until late thursday possibly because 
of a us law preventing presidents from accepting gifts while in 
office 
in france the daily liberation devoted its entire front page to 
a photo taken from the rear of reagan and his wife nancy riding 
off on their horses so long reagan read the caption 
in london mrs thatcher bestowed verbal bouquets on reagan in a 
note made public one day before bushs inauguration 
you have been a great president one of the greatest because 
you stood for all that is best in america she said 
your beliefs your convictions your faith shone through 
everything you did and your unassuming courtesy was the hallmark of 
the true and perfect gentleman you have been an example and an 
inspiration to us all 
in sydney the daily telegraph gave reagan a similar sendoff 
his personal optimism ushered in a new era he gave america a 
new sense of dignity and was an effective moraleboosting 
cheerleader 
history will be kind to mr reagan he will be a hard act to 
follow 
in tokyo the japan times said reagan reigned over a fabulously 
lucky time for the industrialized world 
the englishlanguage daily also credited reagan for reviving 
americas morale after the disasters of watergate vietnam two 
oil crises and the humiliation of the iran hostage affair as a 
result we think that mr reagan should be named man of the 
decade 
israel and arab commentators appeared to agree the change was 
israels loss and the arabs gain 
president hosni mubarak of egypt said he believed bush 
understands the palestinian problem and has good intentions 
the english language jerusalem post said bush has never had an 
emotional proisrael record like his predecessor who has spoken of 
israel with great warmth 
pope john paul ii sent his greetings to george bush and expressed 
hopes the new president would spare no efforts in building world 
peace 
on the occasion of your inauguration as president of the united 
states i wish to renew my greetings and prayerful best wishes to 
you and your family and to all the american people said a

eric mokoto 47 was taken to a hospital in klerksdorp 90 miles 
southwest of johannesburg after his sister julia ramonyadiwa 
returned home last weekend and found him alone in the room the

investigators are focusing on revenge as the 
most obvious motive for the stabbing death of oregons top prison 
official who was attacked outside his office authorities said 
his position as corrections chief obviously brings forward 
revenge as a primary motive marion county district attorney dale 
penn said thursday 
corrections director michael francke 42 who was found dead 
outside his office building early wednesday had received death 
threats penn said 
for anyone whos a prosecutor a judge or working in 
corrections there are threats penn said obviously that has 
to be a priority motive at this time 
francke came to oregon 19 months ago from new mexico where he 
served as a state district judge a prosecutor and as head of that 
states corrections department 
police also were looking into whether the slaying might be 
connected with franckes work in new mexico although penn said the 
focus of the investigation was on oregon 
we havent excluded new mexico but we have local leads that 
are more recent he said adding that investigators had no 
suspects 
a grid search of the crime scene was conducted thursday but 
authorities said no significant evidence was found plaster casts 
were made of a pair of footprints found in a patch of soggy turf in 
front of the porch where franckes body was found

evening and was killed sometime before midnight in the parking lot 
penn said he apparently tried to reenter the building to seek help 
after being stabbed

the plo today rejected a peace plan proposed 
by israels defense minister and called on george bush to curb the 
israeli crackdown on rebellious palestinians in the occupied 
territories 
it is the responsibility of the the new us administration to 
chain the hands of israeli leaders so thirsty for bloodshed ahmed 
abdulrahman the palestine liberation organizations chief 
spokesman said in a statement 
today as george bush assumes his constitutional powers the 
plo calls on the new us administration to move to put an end to 
the terrible zionist crimes against our people 
on thursday israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin unveiled a 
peace plan that included offering the palestinians elections in 
exchange for ending the 13monthold uprising in the west bank and 
gaza strip a ministry spokesman said the proposal reflected rabins 
personal opinion and not government policy 
abdulrahman said the plo strongly rejects the proposals which 
reflect israeli leaders insistence on the continuation of the 
occupation and violence 
the stones of the urpising have thwarted all the zionist 
schemes foremost of which is administrative autonomy and opened 
the door wide for a real peace based on a complete israeli 
withdrawal from palestinian lands and the establishment of an 
independent palestinian state he said 
no to elections under occupation no to the settlements the 
israeli army has no role in the palestinian land he added 
abdulrahman called for an urgent arab summit meeting to discuss 
the explosive middle east situation and draw up a joint arab 
security strategy to remind the major powers and europe of their 
responsibility to solve the middle east problem and revive the peace 
process 
the rabin proposals were also rejected by the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine a marxistoriented palestinian 
guerrilla group headed by george habash 
in a press statement telefaxed to the associated press in cyprus 
the syrianbased faction said the offer was part of israels 
political maneuverings to abort the uprising after the failure of 
the policy of terrorism and suppression

a washington correspondent for the soviet news 
agency tass said today his office has finally received credentials 
to cover the presidential inauguration but after some of the events 
were already over 
i guess youve got silly bureaucrats in your country as we 
have them in ours as well andrei fedyashin said in a telephone 
interview a few hours before the swearingin 
in a story it filed about problems with the inaugural credentials 
committee tass said its reporters had been refused accreditation 
until the last minute 
a call to the inaugural committee to check on the soviets 
complaint brought a recording we are closed for the inauguration 
of george herbert walker bush but will be open again tomorrow 
morning 
another call to the press credentials office brought word from a 
secretary that all members of the committee were out on the parade 
route 
the tass story credited us colleagues in the news media with 
convincing the committee to let tass reporters cover events 
the story said the correspondents received a postcard jan 10 
denying them accreditation 
the report quoted credentials committee member victoria scali as 
telling the tass reporters its a cruel world and there wasnt 
room for more reporters at inaugural events but the story said 
credentials director jim moore later issued the press passes and 
apologized to tass correspondents 
fedyashin said the tass washington bureau has eight 
correspondents and received seven credentials he said it was 
sending reporters or photographers to the capitol for bushs 
swearingin to cover the parade and to watch the new president 
enter the white house 
he said however that soviet reporters from the newspapers 
pravda and izvestia never did get credentials they had requested

currency traders didnt wait for bankers 
hours to get the business day started here today as the philadelphia 
stock exchange launched expanded trading hours with a snowball fight 
and some fast deals 
the exchange introduced its new 430 am starting time 3 
hours earlier than the previous opening time so currency trading 
will coincide with morning hours in europe 
the feeling is if you can make the hours more conducive to the 
business day in europe more business will emanate from the 
philadelphia exchange said barry tague president of tague 
securities the exchanges designated specialist firm in the german 
mark and the japanese yen 
to draw attention to the new hours the exchange threw a 4 am 
snowballthrowing contest outside the exchange no problem even in 
a mild winter since artificial snow was brought in 
the first throw missed the five currency symbols set up under 
floodlights as targets on the street but soon the us dollar 
symbol and the british pound fell and within 15 minutes 
participants were choosing each other as targets instead 
likewise things began moving quickly on the trading floor where 
about 100 people were at work compared with the usual daytime 
150200 with the paris clock on the wall reading 1030 and the 
london clock 930 exchange president nicholas giordano rang the 
bell to officially open currency trading 
within five minutes a furious auction erupted at one end of the 
room resulting in about 1200 contracts for german marks about 
30 million worth said arnold staloff president of the 
philadelphia board of trade 
its important because its important to europe staloff said 
of the early opening europe has been asking us to do this 
europeans want the philadelphia market he said because its 
the only viable listed market on currency options in the world 
the new hours are 430 am to 230 pm and 6 pm to 10 pm 
the latter trading period begun in september 1987 to cover the 
japanese morning hours

lech walesa said today the communist 
partys proposal to legalize solidarity does not go far enough but 
that he is willing to talk with the government if the unions 
leadership agrees 
seeing all the needs and necessities i will try to do 
everything on my side to begin talks about poland as soon as 
possible the solidarity leader said after meeting with workers at 
the gdansk shipyard where the union was founded in 1980 
walesa said at a news conference that he was only expressing his 
own opinion and that he would consult with other solidarity leaders 
over the weekend the trade union will announce its position soon 
after that he said 
i will want to take advantage of all chances for agreement for 
poland because we need it so badly time really presses us walesa 
said 
polands leader gen wojciech jaruzelski endorsed the proposal 
in warsaw on thursday as a momentous event for the nation 
he said solidarity could be legalized if the independent trade 
union federation agreed to respect the law 
the resolution also says new unions must stop accepting financial 
support from the west it does not contain a timetable for 
legalization or call on new unions to refrain from striking but 
party leaders have suggested a twoyear trial period with no strikes 
poles watched jaruzelskis news conference on television and 
could read about the communist party proposal in todays newspapers 
which carried the full text of the position paper on political and 
trade union freedoms 
one can state without any fear of misusing these words that 
poland is entering a qualitatively new stage of transformations of 
her political system said a commentary in zycie warszawy a 
warsaw daily 
but alfred miodowicz the head of the official opzz trade union 
alliance who voted against the party proposal said rankandfile 
workers were not prepared for the changes 
the situation is very tense in the country and i think we are 
facing very serious events in enterprises he said at a news 
conference today although the intent of this position was to 
bring about a peaceful mood in enterprises it seems to me the 
effect could be just the opposite 
the communist partys central committee approved the union 
proposal wednesday in a resolution that said solidarity could be 
legalized so long as it is nonviolent respects the constitution 
and the law and helps reform the hardpressed economy 
trade unions will be such as the working people want them to 
be said the resolution made public thursday 
a subdued jaruzelski said at a rare news conference in warsaw 
that our offer is honest and serious 
asked if he would meet with walesa whom he had detained for 11 
months after declaring martial law in 1981 jaruzelski said never 
say never 
the dramatic reversal by jaruzelski and other party leaders 
underlined the failure of a sevenyear campaign to eradicate the 
independent union movement and the personal popularity of walesa 
the leadership shocked by strikes in may and august and 
confronted by a worsening public mood began to view walesa as a 
potential partner in economic and political reforms aimed at 
reviving the failing economy 
at a news conference in gdansk on thursday walesa said he needed 
to examine the party proposal carefully 
i will try to say something when i see what its like 
walesa said 
he said that under no conditions would he accept a government 
offer that deprives solidarity of its freedom 
after all the experiences losses and struggles we cannot give 
up our independence or sovereignty he said 
if we blow it here other people will have to deal with the 
same problem again i dont want my son or his generation to live 
through such things again where it all accumulates rots and then 
explodes 
we cannot destroy this chance by conceding too much but at 
the same time we should not struggle for some ambitious details 
he said 
legalization of solidarity has become increasingly important 
because of the poor economy walesa said 
he also rejected concerns raised by party hardliners who question 
whether solidarity can be trusted to operate peacefully

leftist guerrillas today fired 
mortars at the headquarters of the treasury police killing at least 
one person officials and witnesses said 10 people were wounded 
including two soldiers 
the attack early this morning was the fourth on a major military 
installation in this capital in three months 
col heriberto hernandez commander of the treasury police said 
two soldiers were wounded inside the base on the citys east side 
two men he described as civilians were badly burned 
witnesses nearby said four other civilians were taken away by red 
cross ambulances they said another woman was wounded by shrapnel 
the civilians also said a man was wounded in an exchange of 
gunfire before the mortars were launched apparently when a soldier 
suspecting an attack tried to detain one of the guerrillas 
the charred and mutilated body of a man lay about three yards 
from the smoldering wreckage of a pickup truck used in the attack 
insurgents in recent months have placed homemade mortars in the 
beds of pickup trucks and parked the trucks near targeted buildings 
the vehicles explode when the first charge is detonated by remote 
control 
the guerrillas clandestine radio farabundo marti reported 
shortly after the attack that the mortars caused extensive 
damage inside the police headquarters 
hernandez showed reporters inside the base small pieces of 
shrapnel presumably from the mortars he said one soldier was 
seriously wounded and the other suffered superficial wounds 
he said no projectile landed inside the compound there was no 
apparent property damage inside the base 
a civilian employee of the treasury police told reporters the 
projectiles exploded in the air a policeman inside the compound 
confirmed that version of events neither the civilian employee nor 
the policeman would give their names 
the explosions damaged walls and broke windows of an adjacent 
office and a home 
the treasury police was originally formed to prevent production 
and sale of homemade liquor and the loss to the treasury through 
unpaid taxes that moonshine resulted in but in the past 20 years 
it has taken on predominantly military functions and has a special 
antisubversive unit 
marxistled guerrillas are waging a 9yearold civil war against 
the usbacked government in 1988 they increased attacks on 
targets in and around the capital bringing what had been a mostly 
rural war to the city 
an estimated 65000 people mostly civilians have been killed in 
the war 
the guerrillas staged three similar mortar attacks in november 
and december on the national guard headquarters the countrys main 
air force base and the headquarters of the joint chiefs of staff 
at least seven people including three civilians were killed and 
more than 60 wounded in the attacks

prosecutors today questioned a doctor about 
whether former philippines president ferdinand marcos is too ill to 
come to new york for arraignment on charges he stole millions of 
dollars from his homeland 
prosecutors crossexamined dr martin cogan an internist who was 
the fourth doctor called as a witness by marcos lawyers 
on thursday cogan said it would be completely inadvisible 
for marcos 71 to travel to new york for arraignment on 
racketeering charges 
us district judge john f keenan conducted the hearing at 
defense request to determine when and where marcos can be arraigned 
and if he is physically competent to stand trial on charges he stole 
103 million 
thursdays session was interrupted by word from hawaii that 
marcos already hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchial asthma 
had suffered a collapsed left lung 
marcos condition improved from guarded to stable thursday night 
and hospital spokeswoman norma kop said he would remain in the 
intensive care unit through today one of his honolulu doctors 
calvin wong said earlier that marcos apparently was out of danger 
kop said that during the lung collapse there were indications 
marcos suffered a heart irregularity 
at the end of thursdays court session keenan said if reports 
from hawaii were correct there is no way in the world he is going 
to be arraigned in a courtroom in the next couple of weeks or 
maybe months 
marcos and his wife imelda have been living in hawaii since 
their ouster in a popular uprising in 1986 
after his indictment in october marcos asked that the 
arraignment be moved from new york to hawaii for health reasons he 
has been hospitalized three times in the last two months twice for 
congestive heart failure 
at thursdays hearing dr robert eliott a cardiologist 
testified in support of the defenses contention that the former 
president was now too ill to be arraigned anywhere 
he was unable to complete a sentence without stopping and 
gasping said the doctor who went to hawaii to give marcos a 
stress test he said marcos was suffering from heart failure and 
kidney problems 
to make a long story short i felt this was a dying man he 
said 
dr neil raskin a san francisco neurologist testified that 
marcos suffered severe headaches that caused excruciating pain 
when he examined him last month 
raskin said that when marcos lawyers contacted him in december 
he said he was biased against marcos from news reports and 
expected to find little or nothing wrong with him 
but when he examined marcos dec 17 said raskin to my 
surprise he was looking terrible looking chronically ill 
prosecutors agreed wednesday that marcos was too sick to be moved 
to new york but urged that the arraignment take place in honolulu

in his address for reaching out to the disadvantaged and the 
homeless 
americans possessions are not the measure of our lives he

of the streets there are young women to be helped who are about to 
become mothers of children they cannot care for and might not love 
they need our care our guidance and education though we bless 
them for chosing life 
the new president said he was committed to a new activism 
handson and involved

first sounded in his convention acceptance last august his way of 
referring to aid from organizations and individuals to help the 
disadvantaged 
we will work on this in the white house in the cabinet 
agencies i will go to the people and programs that are the brighter 
points of light and i will ask every member of my government to 
become involved 
bush had said in advance that his inaugural address would be 
short on specifics and long on broad themes and it was 
he talked in general terms about working with congress to balance 
the federal budget and called for a new harmony that he said should 
replace a chorus of discordant voices on budget issues 
bush said he was extending his hand of friendship to the two 
leaders of the democraticcontrolled congress senate majority 
leader george mitchell of maine and house speaker jim wright of 
texas 
we cant turn back clocks and i dont want to but when our 
fathers were young mr speaker our differences ended at the 
waters edge bush said urging a return to bipartisanship in the

actor griffin oneal was ordered today to 
serve 2 weeks in jail for violating community service provisions of 
his probation for the boating death of a friend 
oneal 24 of los angeles served only 60 of the 400 hours 
ordered in 1987 when he was sentenced in the 1986 memorial day 
boating death of giancarlo coppola 23 son of hollywood director 
francis ford coppola oneal was acquitted of manslaughter in the 
case but convicted of reckless boating 
i was found in violation which was true oneal told 
reporters immediately after being sentenced to 18 days in the county 
jail beginning at noon today 
im here to pay my dues and im willing to do it he said 
oneal admitted he was scared to go to jail then added but i 
think im going to be ok 
anne arundel county circuit court judge martin a wolff said he 
was giving oneal credit for completing a boating safety video 
answering questions at a telephone hotline paying a fine and 
completing some of the required public service work 
however he did not agree with defense lawyer t joseph touheys 
explanation that oneal failed to complete his public service work 
at the san fernando volunteer center 25 miles from his house 
because his drivers license was suspended and he had no car 
touhey disputed the public perception that oneal son of 
hollywood actor ryan oneal lived a life of privilege instead he 
stressed that his client was financially independent and struggling 
to stay employed 
life has not been as grand for him in spite of what people 
think touhey argued his name has become synonymous with this 
case it has colored every aspect of his life 
touhey said oneal has had trouble getting acting roles and 
instead has worked parttime as a painter gardener and laundry 
delivery man while auditioning for minor acting parts 
wolff who originally had sentenced oneal to a 30day suspended 
sentence suggested oneal might have served his 400 hours by simply 
working saturday or sunday afternoons without interfering with his 
employment 
it would not have been a terrible imposition he said

the little girl joel steinberg allegedly beat to 
death left behind enough circumstantial evidence to convict him of 
murder a prosecutor told a jury in closing arguments today 
the only witness to the crime which shocked new yorkers and 
reverberated across the country was the victim 6yearold lisa 
steinberg said assistant district attorney peter casolaro 
although you never heard her voice you never heard her speak 
one word she was the most powerful witness in this courtroom 
casolaro said 
from her grave she delivered circumstantial evidence which you 
should use to convict her murderer the man she believed was her 
father joel steinberg casolaro said that evidence and that 
evidence alone is sufficient for you to reach a verdict 
casolaro recalled that witnesses for the prosecution as well as 
the defense had agreed the child was the victim of a homicide even 
a defense witness agreed that lisa might have survived if she had 
been brought to a hospital sooner 
on thursday lawyers summed up the defense by accusing 
steinbergs former companion hedda nussbaum of killing their 
illegally adopted daughter because she was jealous of the attention 
he gave the girl 
the 47yearold disbarred lawyer has been accused by ms nussbaum 
of fatally beating lisa in november 1987 
hedda has thus far escaped punishment for murdering lisa 
defense attorney ira london said in summation thursday she was 
also granted an opportunity to get revenge against joel by being 
appointed his accuser 
the prosecution says steinberg hit the girl then acted 
recklessly and showed depraved indifference to her life by 
letting her lie unconscious for 12 hours in the apartment without 
seeking help for her 
jurors should begin deliberating by monday in the trial that has 
become a national symbol of child abuse issues 
steinberg denies he ever hit the child and defense lawyers 
maintain ms nussbaum did 
hedda caused the injuries to lisa london said she did it 
herself in a fight 
ms nussbaum her face disfigured from beatings allegedly 
inflicted by steinberg was arrested with steinberg but charges 
against her were dropped and she became the prosecutions star 
witness 
another defense lawyer adrian diluzio called ms nussbaum a 
poor excuse for a woman and a mother 
she didnt care about the kid a bit not one bit diluzio 
said lisa steinberg was a rival lisa got all the attention she 
ms nussbaum thought she should have been getting 
diluzio recalled testimony that nussbaum thought steinberg was a 
god 
if someones stealing your god you kill them and you kill 
them without remorse vindictively he said nor would you ever 
have a sense of guilt about what you did 
specifically diluzio said that when steinberg went out to dinner 
with a friend about 7 pm on nov 1 1987 lisa was alive she 
was alive and she was well while he was out hedda nussbaum had a 
fight that could only have been a fight between hedda and lisa 
ms nussbaum 46 had testified that she never left the house 
after lisa fell unconscious that night diluzio reminded the jury 
that two police officers testified they found ms nussbaum in a car 
about 830 that night drinking beer 
for the past year ms nussbaum has been in a psychiatric 
hospital 
she has escaped prosecution by hiding in mental institutions 
for the past year london said he said she was packaged like a 
cosmetic product to win jury sympathy and avoid prosecution 
she is a woman who lied to keep her freedom london said 
citing testimony by psychiatrists who said she did not have 
emotional problems that warranted hospitalization 
london also pointed to ms nussbaums agreement with the district 
attorneys office granting her immunity from prosecution in return 
for her testimony against steinberg

president reagan pardoned new york yankees 
owner george steinbrenner for his violation of election law during 
the 1972 reelection campaign of richard nixon while two other 
wellknown people were still waiting to hear about the status of 
their pardon pleas 
a senior administration official said thursday that reagan 
approved the pardon of steinbrenner and nine other men the justice 
department had recommended the pardons and reagan gave his ok 
earlier this week 
but the official would not say precisely whether any more pardons 
would be forthcoming today as reagans twoterm presidency ends and 
he gives way to successor george bush 
among those with pardons pending are industrialist armand hammer 
and newspaper heiress patty hearst shaw it could not immediately be 
determined whether the justice departments pardons office had made 
recommendations to reagan on their applications 
under normal procedures a pardon request is sent to the pardons 
office reviewed and then sent to the white house with 
recommendations reagan has granted relatively few pardons with no 
more than 350 approved in his eight years in the office 
none of the nine other men receiving pardons this week was 
wellknown they had served time or paid fines for a variety of 
offenses ranging from income tax evasion and possession of stolen 
firearms to concealment of non taxpaid whiskey 
steinbrenner pleaded guilty in 1974 to charges of violating the 
federal election laws he had been accused of conspiring to violate 
the laws in connection with corporate campaign contributions 
steinbrenner also had been charged with trying to influence and 
intimidate employees of his shipbuilding company into lying to a 
grand jury the questions were raised about the nature of a 100000 
contribution to nixons 1972 reelection campaign 
the contributions were made through the american shipbuilding 
co a clevelandbased firm in which steinbrenner is chief executive 
officer on nov 27 1974 steinbrenner was suspended by 
thencommissioner bowie kuhn from active management of the team for 
two years kuhn reinstated him 15 months later 
steinbrenner paid a 15000 fine but served no time 
steinbrenner was not available for comment said harvey green a 
spokesman for the yankees 
in a new york times interview in early 1988 steinbrenner said 
i feel badly about it it was just one of those unfortunate 
things steinbrenner said he was willing to bear responsibility 
for the crimes but said they happened because he didnt understand 
what the campaign finance act required of him 
patricia hearst shaw now living in connecticut with her husband 
bernard and two daughters was sentenced to seven years in federal 
prison for her role in an armed robbery in san francisco in 1974 
she claimed she had been brainwashed by the radical symbionese 
liberation army after she was kidnaped by members of that group she 
was released from prison after serving only 23 months as her 
sentence commuted by thenpresident carter 
hammers pardon plea has been pending for some time the top 
executive of occidental petroleum had pleaded guilty in 1975 to 
concealing more than 50000 in contributions to nixons 1972 
reelection campaign 
pardons do not cleanse the record of the convicted person 
although a pardon does restore a persons full citizenship rights 
such as voting 
in addition to steinbrenner reagan awarded pardons to 
frederick stiles sentenced in 1978 to four years probation and 
a 500 fine for illegal transfer of machine guns in texas 
oliver swanier sentenced in 1969 to four years probation and 
paid a 500 fine for violations of laws regarding possession and 
concealment of whisky for which no tax had been paid in mississippi

lech walesa said today the communist 
partys proposal to legalize solidarity does not go far enough but 
that he is willing to talk with the government if the unions 
leadership agrees 
seeing all the needs and necessities i will try to do 
everything on my side to begin talks about poland as soon as 
possible the solidarity leader said after meeting with workers at 
the gdansk shipyard where the union was founded in 1980 
walesa said at a news conference that he was only expressing his 
own opinion and that he would consult with other solidarity leaders 
over the weekend the trade union will announce its position soon 
after that he said 
i will want to take advantage of all chances for agreement for 
poland because we need it so badly time really presses us walesa 
said 
polands leader gen wojciech jaruzelski endorsed the proposal 
in warsaw on thursday as a momentous event for the nation 
he said solidarity could be legalized if the independent trade 
union federation agreed to respect the law 
the resolution also says new unions must stop accepting financial 
support from the west it does not contain a timetable for 
legalization or call on new unions to refrain from striking but 
party leaders have suggested a twoyear trial period with no strikes 
poles watched jaruzelskis news conference on television and 
could read about the communist party proposal in todays newspapers 
which carried the full text of the position paper on political and 
trade union freedoms 
one can state without any fear of misusing these words that 
poland is entering a qualitatively new stage of transformations of 
her political system said a commentary in zycie warszawy a 
warsaw daily 
but alfred miodowicz the head of the official opzz trade union 
alliance who voted against the party proposal said rankandfile 
workers were not prepared for the changes 
the situation is very tense in the country and i think we are 
facing very serious events in enterprises he said at a news 
conference today although the intent of this position was to 
bring about a peaceful mood in enterprises it seems to me the 
effect could be just the opposite 
the communist partys central committee approved the union 
proposal wednesday in a resolution that said solidarity could be 
legalized so long as it is nonviolent respects the constitution 
and the law and helps reform the hardpressed economy 
trade unions will be such as the working people want them to 
be said the resolution made public thursday 
a subdued jaruzelski said at a rare news conference in warsaw 
that our offer is honest and serious 
asked if he would meet with walesa whom he had detained for 11 
months after declaring martial law in 1981 jaruzelski said never 
say never 
the dramatic reversal by jaruzelski and other party leaders 
underlined the failure of a sevenyear campaign to eradicate the 
independent union movement and the personal popularity of walesa 
the leadership shocked by strikes in may and august and 
confronted by a worsening public mood began to view walesa as a 
potential partner in economic and political reforms aimed at 
reviving the failing economy 
at a news conference in gdansk on thursday walesa said he needed 
to examine the party proposal carefully 
i will try to say something when i see what its like 
walesa said 
he said that under no conditions would he accept a government 
offer that deprives solidarity of its freedom 
after all the experiences losses and struggles we cannot give 
up our independence or sovereignty he said 
if we blow it here other people will have to deal with the 
same problem again i dont want my son or his generation to live 
through such things again where it all accumulates rots and then 
explodes 
we cannot destroy this chance by conceding too much but at 
the same time we should not struggle for some ambitious details 
he said 
legalization of solidarity has become increasingly important 
because of the poor economy walesa said 
he also rejected concerns raised by party hardliners who question 
whether solidarity can be trusted to operate peacefully

sixtyone moose have died in alaska so 
far this winter in the uneven contest between animal and locomotive 
moose kill figures are kept from november to april when deep 
snow drives the huge animals from their summer range in the 
mountains down toward the path of least resistance firm footing on 
or near the cleared railroad tracks 
a total of 329 moose were killed on railroad tracks during that 
fivemonth period last year said alaska railroad spokeswoman vivian 
hamilton 
mortality is particularly high on a 53mile stretch of rails 
between houston and talkeetna 
the railroad and the state department of fish and game conducted 
an eightday experiment in that area last year to see if moose 
mortality could be reduced 
all the 11000 study proved was that a slow train can kill a 
moose as surely as a fast one the two locomotives assigned to the 
experiment struck 15 moose while traveling 49 mph and 14 animals 
while traveling 25 mph officials said 
were not slowing down this year but we are plowing in those 
areas hamilton said thursday we use wing plows and cut a swath 
of 18 to 20 feet on either side of the rails we dont need that 
kind of distance to run trains 
the railroad tries to recover what meat it can after collisions 
with the wandering moose she said the railroad works with state 
fish and wildlife protection officers who maintain a list of people 
who need the meat 
we notify them state tell them its location and then bring 
it carcass to the nearest road crossing she said if youre 
on the list you go and retrieve it

chief justice william h rehnquist elevated to 
that post in 1986 got his first opportunity today to administer the 
presidential oath of office with the swearingin of george bush 
rehnquist presided at the noontime swearingin ceremony as bush 
succeeded ronald reagan as president 
rehnquist was a supreme court associate justice when reagan 
promoted him to succeed warren e burger who twice administered the 
oath of office to reagan 
dan quayle was sworn in as vice president minutes earlier by his 
own choice supreme court justice sandra day oconnor 
the constitution article ii section 1 to be precise spells 
out the exact oath the president must take nothing in the 
constitution specifies what oath the vice president takes or who 
should administer the oaths 
it has been the american tradition for chief justices to swear in 
new presidents since john jay was asked to swear in george 
washington to a second term 
actually jay said he was unable to attend and sent william 
cushing the supreme courts senior associate justice to administer 
the oath in 1793 
subsequent chief justices have not missed presiding over 
inauguration ceremonies except when a presidents sudden death 
required emergency swearingsin 
most recently lyndon b johnson was sworn in by us district 
judge sarah hughes aboard air force one hours after john f kennedy 
was assassinated

george bush assuming office as the nations 
41st president with a rare mandate for continuity sought today to 
establish himself as a leader ready to take a peaceful and 
prosperous nation into the age of the offered hand 
the new presidents speech contrasted sharply with the sense of 
urgency heard so often from the steps of the capitol on inauguration 
day 
as the first sitting vice president to win the white house in 152 
years bush took office by turning to ronald reagan and saying 
president reagan on behalf of your nation i thank you for 
thwe wonderful things you have done for america 
no one doubted it was a heartfelt tribute to his predecessor 
in this nation with its historic tradition of orderly transfer of 
power the new often take office with kind words for the old 
eight years ago in his inaugural remarks reagan turned to 
democrat jimmy carter to thank him for your gracious cooperation 
in this transition process 
four years before that carter had thanked gerald r ford for 
all he has done to heal our land 
but those kind remarks were only polite prelude to citing the 
troubles the new president believed he was inheriting 
taking office in the depths of the depression franklin d 
roosevelt took office and told a troubled nation that the only we 
have to fear is fear itself a generation later john f kennedy 
warned of the dangers at home and abroad and urged americans ask 
not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your 
country 
richard m nixon took office 20 years ago and described a nation 
caught in war wanting peace torn by division wanting unity 
reagan was in that tradition eight years ago when he told the 
nation in the opening moments of his inaugural address these 
united states are confronted with an economic affliction of great 
proportions 
reagan went on to catalogue the human misery and personal 
indignity caused by rising unemployment in the steel and auto 
industries his speech was filled with references to economic 
ills and this present crisis 
the tone was unmistakable and it was grim 
government is not the solution to our problem government is 
the problem said the conservative republican president a deeply 
held belief that was the basis of an eightyear guerrilla war 
between reagan and the bureaucracy 
to emphasize the urgency of the crisis he believed confronted the 
nation reagan went from the inaugural platform to the presidents 
room of the capitol where he fulfilled a campaign pledge by signing 
an executive order declaring a freeze on hiring of federal civilian 
employees 
for bush who has served in a long list of federal appointive 
posts government was not the enemy even as he chose to suggest 
there was a better solution for many of the nations problems 
the new presidents thousand points of light theme by which 
he refers to private efforts help people was central to his 
inaugural address today 
he described a nation rich with promise we live in a peaceful 
and prosperous time then he added but we can make it better 
he sought to set a moral tone that would depart from the 
materialism of the past eight years 
we are not the sum of our possessions bush told a nation so 
often witness to an administration of glitter and designer gowns 
the new president taking office at a time when homelessness is 
recognized as a national problem called for aa new engagement in 
the lives of others and called for greater cooperation within 
oftenconflicting branches of government 
this is the age of the offered hand he concluded a 
sentiment he no doubt hoped would be a hallmark of his 
administration

dan quayle was sworn in today as the 44th vice 
president of the united states the culmination of his transition 
from a littleknown midwestern senator to the second highest 
official in the land 
quayle who became a lightning rod for critics of george bush 
during the presidential campaign was administered the oath of 
office by justice sandra day oconnor 
his wife marilyn held the bible and their three children 
tucker 14 benjamin 12 and corinne 9 looked on 
it was the reward for what quayle has described as a baptism by 
fire in a campaign dogged by questions about his experience 
qualifications military service and academic record 
his swearingin preceeded by minutes the oathtaking by bush the 
man who thrust quayle into the national spotlight by picking the 
junior senator from indiana as his running mate 
in the traditional oath quayle 41 promised to support and 
defend the constitution of the united states and to bear true 
faith and allegiance to the same 
before the capitol ceremony quayle and his wife marilyn were 
invited to the white house by president reagan for morning coffee 
with bush and his wife barbara 
quayle celebrated into the night thursday attending the indiana 
society ball with fellow hoosiers the inaugural gala and other 
parties honoring the new president and vice president 
noting that he had resigned the senate seat from indiana earlier 
this month to assume the vice presidency quayle quipped my 
mother and father will be happy to know that im gainfully employed 
once again 
he greeted 13000 or more supporters and described them as our 
best friends as they filled the lobby of one of the smithsonian 
institutions museums for the vice presidents reception in the 
afternoon 
quayle borrowed a line from winston churchill in a brief 
reference to the controversy over his experience military record 
and other matters that surrounded his selection to the republican 
presidential ticket last august 
winston churchill once said that theres nothing more 
exhilarating than to be shot at without result quayle said he 
added later that the quotation was rather appropriate to my 
particular case 
quayle repeated his remarks to each wave of guests who crowded 
into the vice presidential reception in groups of 2000 or so the 
guests each paid 20 to attend and received a commemorative 
medallion etched with quayles picture 
here we are ready to go to do the work that you and the 
people of america said they wanted us to do quayle said 
george bush is ready im ready now lets get to work he 
said 
quayle stopped at a downtown fastfood restaurant for breakfast 
on the day before becoming vice president he later spoke to 8000 
high school students from around the nation who gathered at an 
inaugural celebration for young people 
he expressed regret about his own missed opportunities as a 
student 
as one looks back at life ill be the first to admit i wish i 
had taken education more seriously quayle said seriousness 
about education is something to be honest with you i wish i had 
done differently 
the former indiana senator declined to release his college grade 
transcripts during the fall campaign and his record as a less than 
diligent student was a frequent target of critics 
hard work has dignity and let me tell you hard work has 
rewards said quayle those rewards are opportunities 
quayle spoke briefly on thursday about the coming administration 
but made no reference to what he intends to do in a job that carries 
few explicit duties he promised the administration would work to 
help the people that are left out 
during the campaign quayle had to fight the perception that he 
was an intellectual lightweight who had led an easy life and joined 
the indiana national guard to escape duty in vietnam in 1969 
pointing to his 12 years in congress quayle often said during 
the early part of the campaign that he had about the same 
legislative experience that john f kennedy had when he sought the 
presidency in 1960 but he dropped that line after democratic vice 
presidential candidate lloyd bentsen told him during a debate 
senator youre no jack kennedy

superstitious nature has all the same escaped a jinx that has long 
haunted certain presidents 
reagan remains alive at the end of his presidency even though he 
was first elected in a year ending with zero 
for nearly a century and a half every president elected in such 
a year had died in office reagan despite a brush with cancer and 
an assassination attempt was the first to break the jinx 
william henry harrison elected in 1840 died of pneumonia at the 
age of 67 a month after taking office 
abraham lincoln elected in 1860 was assassinated in 1865 at the 
age of 56 
james a garfield elected in 1880 was assassinated a few months 
later at the age of 50

a cerebral hemmorhage in 1945 at the age of 63 
john f kennedy elected in 1960 was assassinated in 1963 at the 
age of 46 
reagan 77 survived an assassination attempt outside a 
washington hotel in 1981 and underwent successful surgery for cancer 
of the colon in 1985 
reagan has often invoked superstitious beliefs from the world of 
show business and sports and declined to disavow first lady nancy

george bush actually became president three 
minutes before he took the oath of office friday while dan quayle 
had to wait a few minutes after taking his oath to become vice 
president 
the constitution says that the clock not the pomp ceremony and 
oaths signals the transfer of the office from the old president to 
the new one 
the 20th amendment to the constitution specifies that the terms 
of office of the president and vice president shall end at noon on 
the 20th day of january and the terms of their successsors shall 
then begin 
bush took the oath of office at 1203 pm est 
quayle took the vice presidential oath several minutes before 
noon 
thus even though quayle had taken the oath ronald reagan was 
still president and bush still vice president until the stroke of 
noon 
a commentary on the constitution published by the library of 
congress in 1973 does note however that the new president cant 
actually do anything until he takes the oath 
before he enter on execution of his office he shall take the 
following oath or affirmation says article ii section 1 clause 
8 of the constitution 
what is the time relationship between a presidents assumption 
of office and his taking the oath asks the commentary 
apparently the former comes first this answer appearing to be the 
assumption of the language of the clause the second congress 
assumed that president washington took office on march 4 1789 
although he did not take the oath until the following april 30

george bush declared that a new breeze is 
blowing on friday assuming the presidency of the united states in 
balmy 50 degree weather 
indeed a northwesterly wind averaging 18 miles per hour was 
ruffling hairdos and judicial robes at the event the wind which 
the national weather service said was gusting up to 25 miles per 
hour and cloudy skies failed to detract from the ceremony 
the pleasant weather for the outdoor event stood in sharp 
contrast to the bitter cold that forced ronald reagan to move his 
swearingin indoors four years ago 
lost in that recollection is the fact that when he first took 
office reagan basked in what may have been the warmest oathtaking 
since the ceremony was moved from march to january back in 1937 
reagans first inaugural came on a cloudy 56 degree day in 1981 
fridays weather was nearly identical to that prevailing in 1953 
when dwight d eisenhower was swornin on a cloudy 49 degree day

somewhere out there is a renowned scholar 
who knows a big mac from a whopper and can whip up a chocolate shake 
in no time 
that at least is what washington state university is counting 
on the school announced thursday it is establishing a distinguished 
professorship of fast food service 
the post in the schools hotel and restaurant management program 
was made possible by a 250000 endowment from taco bell corp and a 
matching grant from the state 
hra director terry umbreit said the university is looking for 
someone who can help build the washington state into the nations 
leading fast food educational institution 
while that may give rise to jokes about classes like french fries 
101 or special sauce for the nonmajor its serious stuff to 
william r bensyl taco bell vice president for human resources 
as our industry matures our business strategies will become 
more complex and we will need trained professionals to help us 
address a variety of issues bensyl said working in tandem with 
an educational leader like wsu gives all of us a chance to benefit

the protesters at eastern washington 
university werent chanting about abortion war famine or free 
speech they were worried about the really big issue 
photocopiers 
we want copies we want copies shouted nearly 100 protesters 
during a halfhour sitin thursday outside the office of school 
president alex schilt 
the issue actually had serious underpinnings among the 
protesters demands were oncampus child care improvements to the 
schools book store and withdrawal from the big sky athletic 
conference 
athletes the students argued were draining money from more 
appropriate expenditures such as photocopiers 
a leader of the demonstration larry davis complained that he 
often needed to copy as many as 50 pages a week for classes but had 
difficulty finding a machine in working order 
during finals and midterms theyre out continually said 
davis 
schilt told the students that school officials had ordered three 
new copiers and would improve wiring in the library that he blamed 
for the frequent shutdowns were going to solve the photocopier 
problem he said 
he also said he asked the legislature for 1 million for child 
care and the issue of athletics is being studied

floridas supreme court today refused to 
postpone ted bundys execution rejecting his lawyers plea to allow 
lower courts to decide whether the suspected serial killer was sane 
during his murder trial 
he wasnt able to assist his lawyers in fact he sabotaged a 
lot of what they were trying to do attorney james coleman told 
reporters after arguing the bundy case before the florida justices 
coleman was expected to carry the appeal to the federal courts 
bundy served as his own attorney through much of his trial in the 
murder of 12yearold kimberly diane leach of lake city he is 
scheduled to die tuesday in floridas electric chair for her 
kidnapslaying 
much of what he did even at the hearing undermined his 
defense and his lawyers were having problems controlling him 
getting him to make decisions getting him to stick to 
decisions said coleman who is representing bundy without a fee 
florida attorney general bob butterworth said after the hearing 
that bundys attorneys were grasping at a straw 
all the courts have found ted bundy to be competent during the 
lake city hearing butterworth said we believe all the issues 
of competency were addressed last year by the federal courts 
the session was scheduled after circuit judge john peach of lake 
city denied three claims thursday in bundys appeal and refused to 
stay the execution set for 7 am tuesday at florida state prison 
near starke 
while the attorneys made their arguments bundy was scheduled to 
meet with fbi officials at the prison the former university of utah 
law student also was expected to meet with authorities from 
colorado idaho washington and utah through the weekend he is 
suspected in the murders of three dozen women in several western 
states 
one of his attorneys diana weiner has said bundy is committed 
to revealing all he knows about unsolved murders she didnt specify 
which cases 
but columbia county state attorney jerry blair who prosecuted 
bundy for the 1978 murder of kimberly leach said it is time for him 
to be executed 
it makes a mockery of our judicial system every day that ted 
bundy continues to live blair said people are virtually up in 
arms about this and every day that justice is delayed justice is 
either denied or at least diminished 
the defense appeal centered on allegations that bundys 
competence to stand trial wasnt adequately reviewed in either the 
leach case or an earlier conviction in the slayings of two chi omega 
sorority sisters at florida state university 
attorneys also argued bundy shouldnt be executed for the leach 
slaying while his competency during the chi omega slayings is still 
being challenged in federal court and circuit judge wallace jopling 
improperly discussed the bundy case with prosecutors without defense 
attorneys present 
all claims were rejected by peach who heard the arguments after 
jopling disqualified himself thursday 
peach said the defense should have raised some of the claims 
earlier and was procedurally barred from raising them at this time 
he made his ruling after hearing about 40 minutes of oral arguments 
in olympia wash gov booth gardner said thursday he considers 
it inappropriate for bundy to play for time by offering to talk 
about his crimes 
it would be nice to have the information he might be willing to 
divulge but i dont think that reprieve is the means to get it 
said gardner a backer of capital punishment i dont think his 
holding that information as ransom at this juncture is appropriate 
bundy whose case was depicted in the television miniseries the 
deliberate stranger was sentenced to death for the feb 9 1978 
murder of miss leach a lake city junior high school student 
in a separate trial he also was sentenced to death for murdering 
two florida state university chi omega sisters in their sorority 
house in january in the early morning hours of jan 15 1978 
gov bob martinez signed the death warrant tuesday less than an 
hour after the us supreme court declined to hear new arguments to 
set aside bundys death sentence 
bundy has been granted a stay of execution three times before 
the last was issued nov 17 1986 six hours before his scheduled 
execution when the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
sent the case back for an evidentiary hearing 
the appeals court and later the us supreme court rejected the 
appeal

america today is a proud free nation decent and civil a place 
we cannot help but love we know in our hearts not loudly and 
proudly but as a simple fact that this country has meaning beyond 
what we see and that our strength is a force for good 
but have we changed as nation even in our time are we 
enthralled with material things less appreciative of the nobility 
of work and sacrifice 
my friends we are not the sum of our possessions they are not 
the measure of our lives in our hearts we know what matters we 
cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car a bigger bank 
account we must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a 
loyal friend a loving parent a citizen who leaves his home his 
neighborhood and town better than he found it 
and what do we want the men and women who work with us to say 
when were no longer there that we were more driven to succeed than 
anyone around us or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had 
gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of 
friendship 
no president no government can teach us to remember what is 
best in what we are but if the man you have chosen to lead this 
government can help make a difference if he can celebrate the 
quieter deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk but of 
better hearts and finer souls if he can do these things then he 
must 
america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high 
moral principle we as a people have such a purpose today it is to 
make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world 
my friends we have work to do there are the homeless lost and 
roaming there are the children who have nothing no love no 
normalcy there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement 
to whatever addiction drugs welfare demoralization that rules 
the slums there is crime to be conquered the rough crime of the 
streets there are young women to be helped who are about to become 
mothers of children they cant care for and might not love they 
need our care our guidance and education though we bless them for 
choosing life 
the old solution the old way was to think that public money 
alone could end these problems but we have learned that that is not 
so and in any case our funds are low we have a deficit to bring 
down we have more will than wallet but will is what we need 
we will make the hard choices looking at what we have perhaps 
allocating it differently making our decisions based on honest need 
and prudent safety 
and then we will do the wisest thing of all we will turn to the 
only resource we have that in times of need always grows the 
goodness and the courage of the american people 
and i am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others a 
new activism handson and involved that gets the job done

and we must bring the federal budget into balance and we must

and our great parties have two often been far apart and 
untrusting of each other 
its been this way since vietnam that war cleaves us still but 
friends that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago and 
surely the statute of limitations has been reached this is a fact 
the final lesson of vietnam is that no great nation can long afford 
to be sundered by a memory

new again

the american people await action they didnt send us here to 
bicker they ask us to rise above the merely partisan in crucial 
things unity and this my friends is crucial 
to the world too we offer new engagement and a renewed vow we 
will stay strong to protect the peace the offered hand is a 
reluctant fist once made strong and can be used with great effect 
there are today americans who are held against their will in 
foreign lands and americans who are unaccounted for

while keeping our alliances and friendships around the world 
strong ever strong we will continue the new closeness with the

there are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up 
united and express our intolerance and the most obvious now is 
drugs and when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship it may 
as well have been a deadly bacteria so much has it hurt the body 
the soul of our country and there is much to be done and to be 
said but take my word for it this scourge will stop

some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpets 
calling and sometimes it is that but i see history as a book with 
many pages and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness 
and meaning 
the new breeze blows a page turns the story unfolds and so 
today a chapter begins a small and stately story of unity 
diversity and generosity shared and written together

as he was leaving bush was asked about his goodbye to former 
president reagan i was trying to keep the tears from running down 
my cheeks after eight years of friendship it was pretty tough

and in our history president reagan on behalf of our nation i 
thank you for the wonderful things you have done for america

meet on democracys front porch a good place to talk as neighbors 
and friends for this is a day when our nation is made whole when 
our differences are for a moment suspended 
sounding again a theme of his presidential campaign bush said 
america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high 
moral principle we as a people have such a purpose today it is to 
make kinder the face of a nation and gentler the face of the world 
he said my first act as president is a prayer 
there is just one use of power and it is to serve people help 
us to remember lord bush said 
bush said he was assuming the presidency at a moment rich with 
promise we live in a peaceful prosperous time but we can make it 
better

action to be taken there are times when the future seems thick as a 
fog you sit and wait hoping the mist will lift and reveal the right 
path

made new again to my friends and yes i do mean friends in the 
loyal opposition and yes i mean loyal i put out my hand

of the streets there are young women to be helped who are about to 
become mothers of children they cannot care for and might not love 
they need our care our guidance and education though we bless 
them for chosing life 
he talked in general terms about working with congress to balance 
the federal budget and called for a new harmony that he said should 
replace a chorus of discordant voices on budget issues 
while suggesting that the vietnam war cleaves us still bush 
said it was time for democrats and republicans to put aside 
differences formed in those war days friends that war began in 
earnest a quarter century ago and surely the statute of limitations 
has been reached he said 
the people await action they did not send us here to bicker

hostages still held in lebanon and americans who are unaccounted 
for saying without elaboration assistance can be shown here

the interior department in the last hours of 
the reagan administration sharply lowered on thursday the rent most 
drillers pay to use federal lands 
the department said in a notice published in the federal register 
that it would charge 1 per acre for many onshore oil and gas leases 
issued before 1987 instead of the 2 to 3 it had been charging 
this will cost the government about 35 million a year for three 
years beginning march 1 said marta witt spokeswoman for the 
departments bureau of land management 
leases issued after passage of a 1987 law revamping such 
procedures carry a statutory rental fee of 150 per acre for five 
years and 2 thereafter 
the decision should keep more lands under lease and provide 
additional capital for exploration and development said the 
notice signed by outgoing interior secretary donald p hodel 
this action is consistent with other steps the department has 
taken over the past two years when oil prices bottomed out and us 
production began to dwindle to the point of serious concerns to the 
point of even national security impact said tim locke a 
spokesman for the bureau 
the american petroleum institute the principal trade 
organization reported earlier in the week that us production in 
1988 was 81 million barrels a day the lowest in 12 years and a 3 
percent decline from the previous year 
in 1985 production was 91 million barrels per day 
the oil price collapse of 1986 devasted domestic production and 
exploration stimulated by the long price runup of the 1970s the 
reagan administration had rejected all calls by domestic producers 
for a protective tariff but did grant other rental reductions in 
1986 and eased some regulations 
the number of exploration rigs at work has fallen from more than 
4000 in 1981 to fewer than 1000 today the amount of federal land 
under lease has fallen from more than 140 million acres in 1983 to 
less than half that today 
about half the acreage now under lease already carries a rental 
charge of 1 per acre said ms witt 
the rental charge is only a small part of the bureaus royalty 
revenue estimated for all minerals at about 800 million annually 
the department also will earn about 25 billion this year from oil 
produced from the outer continental shelf offshore 
in another action hodel recommended that congress approve the 
longstudied trade of land in alaskas arctic national wildlife 
refuge for land owned by native corporations in other alaskan 
refuges 
the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge could 
hold as much oil as the huge field at prudhoe pay 65 to 100 miles to 
the west according to some estimates but congress has refused to 
permit drilling there 
the trade would give the native corporations mineral rights and a 
stake in the development of the arctic refuge in exchange for 
consolidation of federal ownership in the other refuges the general 
accounting office reported to congress last year that the interior 
department was vastly overstating the value of the lands it would 
receive in the deal 
reacting to that proposal the heritage foundation urged that 
publicly owned land be opened to drilling and mining because the 
conservative organization said trouble from the soviet union or 
south africa could endanger the us supply of oil and strategic 
minerals

classified federal documents involving 
national security were found in the offices of a koreanamerican 
businessman charged with trying to export large amounts of deadly 
nerve gas officials said today 
us customs agents searching the summit importexport business 
of juwhan yun found lying on top of a desk papers in both korean and 
english marked classified and confidential customs agent frank 
p ventura testified in us district court 
ventura said military intelligence officials from fort monmouth 
identified the documents as coming from the joint electronics 
warfare command officials did not explain the nature or 
responsibility of the command 
yun 48 of short hills was arrested jan 12 at what he thought 
was to be a meeting with an arms supplier who was actually a 
customs undercover agent the arrest took place at the us customs 
offices in newark where the meeting was arranged after a 
sevenmonth investigation 
authorities said yun sought to acquire missiles and military 
radar equipment for shipment to iran 
yun faces charges of conspiracy to violate the arms export 
control act by trying to arrange shipments of 500 quarterton bombs 
of sarin a nerve gas authorities said they believe the gas was 
intended for iran but they added that has not been verified 
assistant us attorney anne singer disclosed the existence of 
the classified documents after yuns attorney stephen dratch said 
his client was able to meet 2 million bail set tuesday by us 
magistrate ronald hedges 
ms singer said yuns possession of the documents increased the 
risk that he would flee because he may have ties with foreign 
governments those governments ms singer said now may have a 
vested interest in keeping yun from standing trial in the case 
hedges asked ms singer if the documents indicated espionage ms 
singer declined to comment 
yuns possession of the documents might expose him to a more 
serious charge of unauthorized possession of secret documents ms

he was apparently in the process of using them she said she 
did not elaborate 
ms singer said the contents of the papers were not relevant to 
yuns bail status but involved national security

a dispute over whether ferdinand marcos is too 
ill to be arraigned on racketeering charges remained unresolved 
friday when a hearing on the former philippine president was 
adjourned until next month 
more testimony by medical experts on the state of marcos health 
is expected when the hearing resumes feb 9 before us district 
judge john keenan 
the 71yearold marcos suffered a collapsed lung thursday and was 
reported in guarded but stable condition friday at st francis 
medical center in honolulu 
one of his doctors calvin wong said earlier that marcos 
apparently was out of danger 
marcos may have had a heart irregularity during the lung 
collapse hospital spokeswoman norma kop said the deposed leader 
was in the hospital already for pneumonia and bronchial asthma 
fridays hearing was adjourned because the judge had prior 
commitments 
keenan is to determine if marcos is fit to stand trial on charges 
he looted 103 million from his country marcos and his wife 
imelda 59 have been living in hawaii since their ouster in a 
popular uprising in 1986 
after his indictment in october marcos asked that the 
arraignment be moved from new york to hawaii for health reasons he 
has been hospitalized three times in the last two months twice for 
congestive heart failure 
government attorneys have informally agreed that marcos need not 
be brought to new york for arraignment but on wednesday marcos 
attorneys argued that the leader was now too ill to be arraigned 
anywhere or even tried at all 
prosecutors on friday crossexamined dr martin cogan an 
internist who was the fourth doctor called as a witness by marcos 
lawyers cogan said marcos was on at least 20 medications before his 
most recent hospitalization 
that makes it difficult to finetune treatment said cogan a 
cardiovascular specialist who examined marcos last month in hawaii 
thursdays session was interrupted by word of marcoss lung 
collapse prompting keenan to say that if the medical reports were 
true there is no way in the world he is going to be arraigned in 
a courtroom in the next couple of weeks or maybe months

andrei d sakharov rejected as a parliamentary 
candidate by the academy of sciences on friday presented a platform 
calling for military cuts and more democracy to colleagues who in 
protest nominated him for another seat 
i am far from enthusiastic about much of what has happened in 
our country in the past year sakharov softly told coworkers at 
the lebedev institute of physics citing new limitations on 
cooperatives meetings and demonstations and the government 
reaction to the armeniaazerbaijan dispute 
the 67yearold nobel peace prize winner and dean of the soviet 
human rights movement spoke at the institute from which he was 
banished for almost seven years for his criticism of the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan 
sakharovs bumpy candidacy for the congress of peoples deputies 
the new parliamentary body president mikhail s gorbachev says is a 
crucial element of reform illustrated the bugs remaining in the 
cumbersome electoral system approved in december as well as the 
resistance facing many of the staunchest backers of reform 
sakharov appearing tired and resting his chin on a hand that 
clutched his glasses listened quietly as hundreds of his colleagues 
unanimously demanded that the decision by the academy leadership be 
declared invalid and nominated him for a seat in the congress from 
the oktyabr region of moscow where the institute is located 
institute workers already had approved sakharovs candidacy by a 
vote of 154322 but crowded into the conference hall to hear a 
20minute outline of his views on foreign affairs ethnic policy 
the economy and human rights sakharov then answered written 
questions sent to the podium 
sakharov who in september called for a 50 percent cut in the 
amount of time soviets must spend in military service departed from 
his two pages of text to term gorbachevs announcement wednesday 
that the number of military personnel will be cut by 12 percent 
extraordinarily important 
but i think more radical cuts are necessary he added they 
are fully possible in the present international circumstances 
but he criticized the kremlins policy on the ethnic disturbances 
in armenia and azerbaijan called a new law on meetings and 
demonstrations an antiperestroika law and a directive by the 
council of ministers in december ordering cooperatives out of some 
lucrative businesses as a step backward 
he said it was senseless to insist that the nagornokarabakh 
the source of the bloodletting between armenia and azerbaijan 
remain part of azerbaijan this is completely unacceptable for the 
entire armenian population he said 
he renewed his demands for release of all political prisoners and 
laws guaranteeing complete freedom of association 
if elected sakharov pledged to pursue his views with all his 
strength 
sakharov helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s 
but turned to human rights activities in the 1960s and 1970s he was 
banished in january 1980 to the closed city of gorky for his 
criticism of the drive into afghanistan and remained there until 
gorbachev allowed him to return to moscow in december 1986 
since then he generally has supported gorbachev but occasionally 
criticizes some aspects of the soviet leaders policies 
the academy of sciences has the right to elect 25 members of the 
new congress which will be made up of 2250 people a third will be 
elected from social political or trade union organizations 
including the academy the remaining twothirds will be selected on 
the basis of balloting in geographic districts 
a meeting of academy of sciences leaders on wednesday chose 23 
candidates to present to the entire membership as candidates from 
among more than 130 members who were nominated two more were chosen 
thursday by affiliates of the academy 
sakharov was nominated by more than 50 institutes of the academy 
but was not among the final 23 other losers were such reformers as 
space scientist roald sagdeev nominated by 25 institutes and 
economists gavril popov nominated by 16 and nikolai shmelev 
nominated by 11 
the newspaper izvestia said that among the others not chosen were 
economist abel aganbegyan and dmitri likhachev the dean of soviet 
historians 
now nominated as a candidate from a geographical district 
sakharovs candidacy must pass through at least one local electoral 
commission before it can be presented to voters march 26 supporters 
said several other institutes would also nominate sakharov from the 
same district to strengthen the possibility his name will be on the 
final ballot 
the unanimous resolution from the lebedev institute complained 
that the leadership of the academy of sciences excluded any 
representatives of scientific workers from taking part in their 
deliberations and that all those nominated were topranking figures 
in the academy 
it said none of them were nominated by as many institutes as 
sakharov sagdeev popov or shmelev it said the academys decision 
was invalid because those chosen did not receive an absolute 
majority of votes from the 370 members of the selection committee 
only about 190 members actually attended the session and voted it 
said

it took a sixmonth study to settle the 
issue but dow chemical co has decided to keep its middle name as 
well as the first and last 
frank popoff dow president and chief executive officer said 
friday that an internal committee and a consultant had looked into 
changing the 92yearold corporate identity and recommended against 
any change 
dow spokesman tom henderson said he didnt know how much the 
study cost and he wouldnt reveal any alternative names that were 
considered 
in october the company was said to be considering dropping 
chemical from its name to reflect dows expanding role in 
nonchemical industries such as insulation and household goods 
for years the dow name was associated with napalm and agent 
orange defoliant both of which were used during the vietnam war 
but henderson said i dont think it was part of the consideration 
of changing the name 
we are not inundated any more with negatives around the agent

a un official said friday she hopes president 
bush will end a threeyear boycott of un familyplanning programs 
that washington has accused of supporting forced abortions in china 
nafis sadik executive director of the un fund for population 
activities said we see a new opportunity with the new 
administration 
the united states has withheld about 85 million from the agency 
since 1985 charging that chinese familyplanning programs backed by 
the agency involve forced abortions 
however ms sadik said friday we are not supporting any 
abortion program anywhere in the world 
she also said chinese officials had stressed to her that although 
isolated cases of coercion do crop up china does not force women to 
undergo abortions 
ms sadik said bush ws strongly supportive of population 
policies as us ambassador to the united nations in 197173 she 
also said he should have special sympathy for china where he 
lived in 197475 as head of the us liaison office 
ms sadik of pakistan said she also told the chinese they 
should work harder to improve the image of their familyplanning 
program 
chinese officials are striving to hold down a population of 11 
billion the largest in the world since 1980 they have tried to 
enforce a onechild per couple policy 
the policy has met some success in the cities but encountered 
resistance in the countryside where the return of family farming 
has made it advantageous to have more children newly affluent 
farmers are often willing to pay heavy fines imposed for giving 
birth to two or more children 
after dipping in the early 1980s the rate of population growth 
has begun to creep up again demographers estimate the population at 
the end of the century will be about 128 billion 80 million above 
the original target 
however sadik said african countries many of which have just 
begun familyplanning programs were hit hardest by the withdrawal 
of us funds

opponents of us military bases 
called off a rally planned friday at the subic bay naval station 
after troops stopped them at checkpoints and residents marched in 
counterprotest 
shops closed and public transport came to a halt in olongapo the 
city where the usrun base in located mayor richard gordon spoke 
of a peoples strike in reverse 
they will be stretching their luck too far if they insist on 
coming after five he said of the protesters im sorry for 
them but ill have to send them back 
the opponents of the bases turned back to manila after reaching 
within 10 miles of the city because their rally permit expired at 5 
pm 
at least 10000 residents spilled onto the streets for boisterous 
marches as riot police stood nearby one group of several hundred 
marched down a street with a band playing god bless america 
many people in this city of 150000 depend on the base for their 
living 
the group of more than 2000 activists who oppose any us 
nuclear weapons on philippine territory planned to hold a rally at 
the gates of the base in olongapo 
however soldiers manning at least five checkpoints delayed the 
group prompting one protester sen josephine valentinne of 
australia to say the philippines is a country being run by the 
military 
weve come here with a peaceful mission she said we have 
not come to upset anyone or to disturb the peace 
the soldiers said they were looking for weapons and infiltrators 
from communist rebel or other groups 
the rally at olongapo would have been the second such 
demonstration by the group in two days on thursday after arriving 
in a motorcade from manila the group marched toward the gates of 
usrun clark air base about 30 miles from olongapo however it 
was blocked about 300 yards away by riot troops and thousands of 
local residents supporting the base 
the motorcade was organized by several groups opposed to the 
bases 
the united states maintains six military installations in the 
philippines and their lease expires in 1991 the philippine 
government must approve any new one and much opposition to the 
bases has developed in the congress and among the public

it appears more likely that former prime 
minister paul vanden boeynants who vanished from his home a week 
ago may be dead a police official said friday 
chief investigator andre vandoren told reporters that neither he 
nor the family of vanden boeynants has heard anything more from a 
group called the revolutionary socialist brigade which claimed to 
hold the 69yearold politician 
the group said in a letter to two newspapers tuesday it was 
holding vanden boeynants for 770000 ransom he disappeared jan 14 
i must conclude that we have no proof that a movement or people 
that have made themselves known have indeed kidnapped mr vanden 
boeynants vandoren said 
when pressed by reporters to say whether he believed vanden 
boeynants had been killed vandoren said murder was among the 
possibilities from the start but i must say it is now gaining 
ground 
on thursday officials ruled out the possibility vanden 
boeynants 69 had staged his own disappearance 
the christian democrat received a threeyear suspended jail 
sentence for tax evasion and fraud in 1986 as the head of a meat 
packing business 
he is under investigation for corruption when he was defense 
minister in the 1970s 
vanden boeynants disappeared after parking his car in a garage 
near his apartment complex in brussels in the garage police found 
his pipe a shoe and a hearing aid along with a syringe cap leading 
to speculation he may have been sedated 
in addition to the revolutionary socialist brigade the extreme 
leftwing communist combat cells claimed responsibility for vanden 
boeynants disappearance 
in 1984 and 1985 the group staged a bombing campaign against 
business and nato targets throughout belgium in october four of 
its members received life sentences in connection with those attacks 
vanden boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and again 
from late 1987 to early 1979 he served as defense minister for 
seven years in the 1970s 
he was also a brussels alderman for more than 30 years beginning 
in 1952 during which time he oversaw a drastic urban renewal 
program that made him the bane of urban conservationists 
the brigades letter demanded that twothirds of the ransom be 
donated to the poor by several relief groups the ransom was to be 
provided by vanden boeynants political and business associates

sixyearold lisa steinberg provided enough 
circumstantial evidence from her grave to convict joel steinberg 
of her murder a prosecutor told the jury friday 
although you never heard her voice you never heard her speak 
one word she was the most powerful witness in this courtroom 
assistant district attorney peter casolaro said in closing arguments 
steinberg a 47yearold disbarred lawyer is accused by his 
livein companion hedda nussbaum of fatally beating their 
illegally adopted daughter in 1987 the case is expected to go to 
the jury on monday 
from her grave she delivered circumstantial evidence which you 
should use to convict her murderer the man she believed was her 
father joel steinberg said casolaro that evidence and that 
evidence alone is sufficient for you to reach a verdict of guilty 
the prosecutor said steinberg told six versions of how lisa 
suffered some 20 bruises and five versions of the events on the 
night she was fatally injured 
casolaro noted there were cuts and bruises on steinbergs 
knuckles when he was interviewed by police shortly after they 
removed lisa from the apartment 
his failure to explain them is just as powerful as the fact 
that they are there said casalaro adding there were no cuts 
and bruises on hedda nussbaums hands 
the prosecutor noted that steinberg after learning that lisa was 
probably brain dead asked doctors what else is wrong with her 
a statement defense lawyers called a nervous reaction of a 
concerned parent 
the question might better be phrased did you find my knuckle 
prints on the side of her head casolaro told jurors that is 
cold and uncaring and depraved 
on thursday defense lawyers giving their summation accused ms 
nussbaum of killing lisa because she was jealous of the attention 
steinberg gave the girl 
ms nussbaum her face disfigured from beatings allegedly 
inflicted by steinberg was arrested with him but charges against 
her were dropped and she became the governments chief witness 
prosecutors said she had been too brutalized to help or hurt the 
girl for the past year she has been in a psychiatric facility

between present and future bosses

the associated press today began transmission 
of a photograph of george bush just 40 seconds after the new 
president took his oath of office saving nearly a halfhour by use 
of a digital camera 
the photo was made by ap staff photographer ron edmonds using a 
nikon camera and shooting from a stand in front of the capitol the 
camera captures the image on a disk in digital format the picture 
is immediately available for transmission no film processing or 
printmaking is required 
once the picture of bush was made edmonds inserted the disk into 
a small transmitter at his position at the touch of a button the 
transmission started and a telephone line carried it directly onto 
the ap picture network and to us newspapers 
photo transmission normally begins 30 minutes or more after the 
photographer snaps the shutter and after chemical processing 
the highspeed picture was provided to meet the pressing 
deadlines of evening newspapers digital pictures of this kind 
usually are slightly less sharp than those from classic silverfilm 
cameras but are adequate for newspaper reproduction in tight 
deadline situations

poles picked up their friday newspapers to 
find the communist party advocating the legalization of solidarity 
a radical aboutface they greeted with surprise hope and a dose of 
skepticism 
it is all just a big mess said a 53yearold printer on a 
warsaw street corner i dont know if there is going to be 
anything good of it at all i am not a pessimist but i am not an 
optimist either time will show 
i am surprised obviously as they banned it here and now they 
restore it he said it is just chaotic 
i am very happy myself said an accountant perhaps 
something will change for the better 
the official press has brought poles hints of change during 
recent months including the first interviews with solidarity leader 
lech walesa since the east blocs only independent trade union was 
banned following the imposition of martial law in 1981 
this week official newspapers carried an unusual frank 
discussion of the heated debate during the party central committee 
meeting and word that gen wojciech jaruzelski had offered to resign 
as head of state after running into stiff opposition to paving the 
way for new political and union freedoms 
on friday newspapers carried the party position paper that opens 
the door to talks between the government and the opposition at which 
legalization of solidarity could be negotiated 
and walesa whose illegal movement the government has tried to 
eradicate for seven years appeared answering questions about the 
plan on the staterun televisions evening news program 
a commentary accompanying the party text in the daily zycie 
warszawy called the decision an act of realism in perceiving 
polish realities 
those realities include shortages from mattresses to medicine a 
decaying infrastructure and inflation as rampant as peoples 
cynicism 
well live and see said a warsaw electronic technician it 
is certainly good and the situation should get better but we will 
see as you know it has been like this many times 
at the lenin shipyard in gdansk where solidarity was born the 
legalization offer was the no 1 topic of comment said edward 
fzajkiewicz deputy chairman of the solidarity committee 
he proclaimed workers 100 percent behind walesa 
the reds too chimed in another worker referring to the 
party members at the plant 
they all have a general feeling that they finally gave way 
fzajkiewicz said doubts have to be taken into consideration but i 
think the sides are condemned to come to agreement 
walesa said he is willing to start talks with the government if 
other solidarity leaders agree during weekend meetings he discussed 
the situation during a shipyard rally after which one worker called 
the government offer a big step 
but it should be cut and dried he said theyre saying 
maybe theyll give you this much and that much and maybe nothing 
and maybe they are again preparing truncheons from above it could 
be a trick 
party members interviewed on state radio also were cautious 
the question is often repeated concerning safeguards 
conditions which would not allow that the year 1981 could be 
repeated said one 
in warsaw the electronic technician recalled the 198081 period 
too 
we are certainly worse off economically now he said but on 
the other hand it is better that we can talk like now and we are 
not afraid 
he added that he has been surprised since he saw government 
spokesman jerzy urban discussing solidarity on tv urban 
previously would spit on walesa and now he says mr walesa he 
said

some 200000 people assembled friday on what 
president bush called democracys front porch for a chilly 
firsthand look at inaugural history 
a little crazy and a little blue ticket will get you here 
said carlos vasquez of antioch calif one of the first to surge 
forward when makeshift gates on the capitols west front were opened 
to standingroom ticketholders 
it was like they were giving food away said tara scully of 
washington 
no money said lyndsey smith also of washington 
red white blue and fur were the hallmarks of the windswept 
bicentennial inauguration bunting and flags were draped all over 
the capitol facade and the us marine band sat below the podium in 
bright red uniforms 
one spectator occidental petroleum lobbyist bob robertson made 
ink sketches on a yellow pad in preparation for a more elaborate 
watercolor he would paint at home i just want to get the flavor 
of it he said 
the weather started out so warm and sunny that one young man 
closed his eyes and tilted his head into the sun catching tanning 
rays as he listened to the patriotic musical prelude performed by 
the marine band and the mormon tabernacle choir 
it turned cooler later but not as severely as in 1984 when 
bitter cold forced ronald reagan to move his swearingin indoors 
at fridays event thick clouds accompanied by a cutting wind 
rolled in about 90 minutes before the ceremonies began the young 
members of the military color guard had to fight their way out of 
the flags furling around their heads and as the sun disappeared 
the furs came out 
in the diplomatic spouses section of the audience nearly every 
wife appeared to be wearing mink others were more daring betty 
wright wife of house speaker jim wright dtexas wore a short 
spotted fur as she sat in a conspicuous place of honor on the 
balustrade and monica zunt of cleveland sported a huge gray fur hat 
adorned with a dozen brown feathers 
i figure where else can i wear it said zunt its the 
official inaugural hat 
gary wetzel snapping pictures of the us marine band wore a 
black tshirt adorned with his medal of honor im from wisconsin 
this is spring weather he said wetzel who had only one arm 
said he was shot down in a helicopter in vietnam and i saved a 
bunch of guys 
barbara bush was wearing a turquoise coat and white gloves during 
the ceremony but bush wore no overcoat or hat during the rev 
billy grahams invocation bush was seen trying to plaster his hair 
back off his forehead and during his own speech he stopped once to 
wipe his nose with a handkerchief 
we meet on democracys front porch bush told the crowd 
before echoing his campaign themes of a thousand points of light 
and a kinder gentler nation 
officer dan nichols of the us capitol police said about 200000 
people attended the swearingin ceremony he called it completely 
trouble free no arrests no incidents and no medical emergencies 
some people on the lawn were diehard republicans who had made 
arrangements months in advance to attend the inauguration but for 
others it was a spurofthemoment affair a brother who couldnt 
come in from richmond va a condo neighbor who offered three 
spares on thursday and one woman said she got her ticket from the 
man to whom she sold her house 
many said they had come only for the ceremony and would reserve 
judgment on bush 
its a gentler kinder nation so were openminded said ed 
rogers a washington lawyer its a little early to tell yet 
added his colleague leslie turner 
one democrat ann giesecke an employee of the environmental 
protection agency acknowledged that she felt a little sadness 
at the occasion but margaret mcarthur of fayetteville nc 
sitting next to giesecke had no such qualms 
im for him 100 percent she said of bush i might be 
sitting in the democratic section but im a republican 
mcarthur said she was attending one of two youth balls friday 
night shes 55

as ronald reagan headed for the plane that 
would carry him off to california a familiar voice shouted how 
about a word mr president how about a word 
as usual reagan responded with a grin and shrug 
it was likely to be the last time abc correspondent sam donaldson 
would shout at reagan in washington at least donaldson got on 
the plane with the former president to cover his arrival in 
california later 
when reagan left the white house friday morning donaldson left 
too after 12 years as abcs chief white house correspondent he had 
frequently said in the past that he was going to leave but finally 
did it after reagan 
im going out with no regrets he said thursday and its a 
pleasure theyre not carrying me out feet first and not pushing me 
out but im going of my own will 
brit hume took over the job as of noon friday with the 
inauguration of george bush donaldson is expected to be named 
coanchor later this year of a new primetime abc news program and 
will continue to appear on this week with david brinkley 
before getting on the plane donaldson noted to abc anchorman 
peter jennings that abc too was undergoing a changing of the guard 
im history like ronald reagan he said 
i hope i havent upset too many of president carter or 
president reagans partisans donaldson said a reference to his 
reputation as the most aggressive member of the white house press 
corps 
his habit of shouting questions at reagan during photo 
opportunities was often cited by critics as an example of an 
arrogant and disrespectful news media 
donaldson said again thursday he shouted questions only when 
there was no other way to get an answer 
to talk to jimmy carter except in the last few months of his 
presidency when he hunkered down over the hostage crisis he was 
available donaldson said for reagan the alternatives were go 
for months or speak out and if as they always did in public keep 
him 50 yards away to speak out meant you had to raise your voice 
he thought his successor might have an easier time of it i 
trust from what we know about him no ones going to have to yell at 
george bush donaldson said 
if reagans supporters were irked by donaldson the white house 
staff seemed to take him in stride the final white house news 
summary under the reagan administration included a reprint of a 
cartoon from the memphis commercial appeal depicting a smiling 
reagan in a tshirt inscribed i survived donaldson

the archbishop of canterbury prayed friday for the 
safe return of his envoy terry waite who vanished in beirut two 
years ago while trying to negotiate the release of foreigners held 
hostage in lebanon 
david waite said he believed his 49yearold brother would be 
freed this year and british officials expressed optimism waite and 
other british hostages are alive although there has been no 
physical evidence of that 
the leftist beirut daily assafir said four of the 15 foreign 
hostages were moved from a jail near the city to a new location but 
it did not give further details in the unattributed report 
to observe a second anniversary is a disappointment but we 
remain ever hopeful of his return the church of englands 
spiritual leader robert runcie said in a nationally broadcast 
sermon from a london church 
we look with hope for the release of all hostages and those 
unjustly imprisoned he said 
waites fate has been a mystery since he disappeared jan 20 
1987 after leaving the riviera hotel in west beirut apparently to 
meet with shiite moslems holding some american hostages it was his 
fifth mission to lebanon 
in the previous 17 months the 230pound 6foot7 church envoy 
had been credited with obtaining freedom for three us hostages 
but lebanese officials and some western sources believe waites 
prestige had been compromised by news that the reagan administration 
negotiated freedom for the rev benjamin weir the rev lawrence 
jenco and david jacobsen by delivering us weapons to iran 
no group has claimed responsibility for kidnapping waite british 
journalist john mccarthy or angloirish teacher brian keenan and 
there have been no messages from them 
britains ambassador in beirut allan ramsay said the three 
britons are probably held in deplorable conditions deprived of 
freedom and most human contact 
there is nothing to suggest they are not alive he was quoted 
as saying by britains domestic news agency press association we 
have indications which confirm that though nothing very recent 
he called on the kidnappers to release the captives 
there is nothing to be gained by continuing to detain these 
people a moment longer there are no bargains to be struck 
ramsay said in remarks published in lebanese papers 
waites brother said he was satisfied with official efforts to 
gain waites release 
we are still optimistic he said we believe terry will be 
back with us again before the next year goes by 
islamic jihad is the proiranian shiite faction holding americans 
terry anderson and thomas sutherland anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press is the hostage held longest 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
sources said waite was driven to the home of a shiite physician 
where he was taken hostage 
hostages freed since then have reported seeing a burly man they 
believed was waite in an underground prison 
runcie had expressed concern to waite about his decision to 
travel to beirut but was convinced by his determination to go 
church spokeswoman eve keatley said friday 
runcie asked god to help all hostages and to sustain them in 
their loneliness give them courage to face each new day with 
hope he also prayed for the ordinary people of lebanon where 
suffering caused by hostagetaking has been known by so many 
communities 
irans closest ally in lebanon sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
was quoted as saying the issue of the foreign captives is now 
frozen fadlallah is spiritual mentor of the iranianbacked 
hezbollah believed to be an umbrella organization for groups 
holding hostages 
the middle east reporter an englishlanguage newsletter said 
fadlallah refused to comment further on the hostages

ronald reagan turned one last time as he headed 
out the oval office door friday casting his eyes about the room 
with a melancholy look 
chills went through you said a witness after watching the 
nations 40th president leave the historic office 
just two hours before he turned over the presidency to george 
bush reagan paid a sentimental visit to the spacious room in the 
west wing hed used for eight years 
sunlight streamed through the lightly greentinted bulletproof 
windows as reagan met for one last time with his national security 
adviser lt gen colin powell 
the world is quiet today mr president powell said 
offering reagan his last assesment of the worlds trouble spots 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater who was present in the 
oval office said the last piece of paper the president signed was a 
letter to british prime minister margaret thatcher thanking her for 
her support 
reagan also left a handwritten note to bush in his desk wishing 
him well fitzwater said 
the room had been swept clean of reagans personal mementoes 
the pictures of his wife nancy children and friends that had 
adorned the table behind his desk the engraved crystal paperweights 
and pens were atop it 
in anticipation of reagans successor the trappings of the 
office remained the multibuttoned white telephone on the large 
wooden desk the presidential and us flags by the windows 
overlooking the south lawn 
reagan shook hands with the top aides whod come to bid him 
farewell and greeted the photographers whod been invited to capture 
the moment for history 
well lets all line up for the picture reagan told them as 
they gathered for a photo with the man theyd captured on film for 
so many years 
the president walked over to his desk an ornately carved and 
columned piece constructed from the timbers of the hms resolute it 
had been presented to president rutherford b hayes in 1880 by queen 
victoria 
reagan sat silently for a moment then put his hands on the 
desks leather top stood up and pushed his leather chair in place 
head bowed he headed for the door but turned to cast one last 
sweeping look about the oval room before striding out the door 
it was an incredible moment said one of those present in the 
room who asked not to be quoted by name chills went through 
you 
then for the last time reagan walked down the arched colonnade 
toward the executive mansion a small group of staff members and 
journalists called farewells to him through the glass doors near the 
rose garden 
softly calling out goodbye and lifting his arm in a brief 
wave reagan turned and strode toward the mansion and out of sight

george bush sought in the lofty cadences of his 
inaugural address to move finally from a partisan playing on 
national divisions to a president governing a nation made whole 
bush had said his speech would be scant on specifics it was 
instead he spoke of a moment rich with promise and offered 
an often poetic expansion on the kinder gentler themes he first 
enunciated last august in accepting the republican presidential 
nomination 
but in his vow to devote new attention to the homeless the 
disadvantaged the forgotten and the drugaddicted he also sounded 
a note of reality in a time of 100 billionplus deficits 
we have more will than wallet but will is what we need the 
nations 41st president told the nation 
bushs speech pulled together most of the humanitarian objectives 
he touched upon in the presidential campaign but which were often 
lost in the clamor of a race more remembered for bitter trench 
fighting questions of patriotism and willie horton 
but as if to put the scars of the campaign behind him bush also 
appealed to bipartisanship in the conduct of domestic and foreign 
affairs 
the people await action he said they did not send us here 
to bicker the remarks seemed clearly directed at the leaders of 
capitol hill 
he talked about burying differences sharpened by the vietnam war 
and of a new harmony between the nations great parties 
and while promising a new breeze he also sought to build on 
the legacy of the reagan administration of which he was a part for 
eight years championing open trade and free enterprise trumpeting 
the economic recovery and improved relations with the soviets 
it was a speech rich in metaphors bush used the image of an 
outreached hand both to express an overture to peace at home and 
abroad and to demonstrate a national resolve 
we will stay strong to protect the peace he said adding 
that the offered hand is a reluctant fist once made strong and 
can be used with great effect 
if the language of bushs inaugural address sounded similar to 
his previous evocations of a kinder and gentler nation and a 
thousand points of light its no surprise 
fridays speech was written largely by peggy noonan who also 
wrote his convention acceptance speech many of his less combative 
campaign speeches and part of reagans farewell address to the 
nation 
nor was it a surprise for the new president to talk eloquently of 
cooperation with congress of mending fences of presiding over a 
nation without division he has sounded such themes before 
for bush the need for cooperation is more than just rhetoric 
when democrat jimmy carter was inaugurated both chambers of 
congress were under the control of his own party ronald reagans 
1980 landslide victory also delivered the senate into republican 
hands 
but bush takes the helm with both the house and the senate in 
democratic hands and with the battle over budget priorities likely 
to be the first test of his infant leadership 
it is a political reality of which bush was mindful there is 
much to do he declared and tomorrow the work begins 
tomorrow perhaps he will take comfort in the comments of david 
bonior a democratic congressman from michigan 
the tone of the presidents address was conciliatory and 
hopeful congress will respond very positively to bushs efforts to 
reach out and unite the country he set forth a modest yet humane 
vision for the coming years it was a good kickoff to a new era

riot police dispersed crowds that 
gathered friday to hold a sixth day of demonstrations and the 
government denounced calls for greater freedom 
police threatened violence but did not use it on the wouldbe 
protesters in wenceslas square in central prague that since sunday 
had been the site of daily demonstrations 
the unrest marked the most sustained display of dissatisfaction 
with the government since the soviet invasion in 1968 
the worst violence of the week came thursday when at least nine 
people were injured as hundreds of police with truncheons charged a 
crowd of more than 2000 people calling for a free press free 
elections and freedom of assembly 
several dozen people were arrested thursday according to the 
official media activists said at least 20 leading dissidents 
remained held friday 
activist petr uhl of the human rights group charter 77 said tomas 
hradilek a spokesman for the movement was detained friday at work 
in lipnik nad becvou in moravia about 180 miles east of prague 
uhl said the detention meant that all three of charter 77s 
spokesmen were in custody it appeared that hradilek would be held 
for 48 hours he said 
as soon as people began gathering friday on wenceslas square 
police in vans circled the halfmilelong boulevard flanking the 
square and said through bullhorns citizens your gathering is 
unlawful 
police warned that riot police would move in if crowds did not 
disperse 
fifteen minutes later officers blocked side streets leading to 
the top half of the square and formed a human cordon across its 
center plainclothes and uniformed riot police jostled those 
reluctant to disperse 
the communist party daily rude pravo in a frontpage editorial 
friday denounced the unrest as an attempt to restore the democracy 
that existed before the communist takeover in 1948 
a return to the conditions of the bourgeois republic is out 
of the question the daily said lets emphasize this 
unequivocally no matter who dislikes it 
the unrest started sunday with a rally to commemorate jan palach 
a student who committed suicide by setting himself afire in january 
1969 to protest the 1968 invasion 
charter 77 planned a vigil saturday at palachs grave in the 
village of vsetaty 18 miles north of prague 
two police cars friday were stationed on roads leading to the 
village and a plainclothes policeman at the entrance to the 
cemetery said the area where palachs urn was buried was closed a 
sign said the closure was for technical reasons 
in prague plainclothes police disrupted a report by an austrian 
television reported who was not allowed to finish the taping in 
wenceslas square 
the unrest reflects the desire of many czechoslovaks for more 
freedom and political reforms than the government has been willing 
to accept 
but the demonstrations also have made clear that the activists 
are a minority in a society that despite growing economic problems 
still has one of the highest standards of living in the east bloc 
the official media has repeatedly blamed charter 77 and other 
independent groups for the unrest 
charter 77 member anna sabatova said several of the jailed 
dissidents have been told they will be prosecuted 
on thursday 15 former communists sent a letter to the 
czechoslovak government urging a halt to the media campaign 
against charter 77 they also demanded the release of jailed 
dissidents said one of the signatories former foreign minister 
jiri hajek

military authorities again shut all 1200 
schools in the west bank on friday barely a month after they 
reopened in a renewed effort to quell violence in the 13month 
palestinian uprising 
in the west bank and gaza strip a palestinan alleged to be an 
israeli collaborator was shot to death and another suspected 
collaborator died of wounds suffered earlier at least 15 
palestinians were reported wounded in clashes with soldiers 
most of the injuries occurred when troops fired on stonethrowing 
protesters at three gaza strip refugee camps arab reporters said a 
12yearold boy was reported shot in the leg when a clash erupted 
after moslem noon prayers in the west bank city of hebron 
the army confirmed the two deaths and said it had reports of six 
injured at least 365 palestinians and 15 israelis have died in the 
revolt 
the plo and other palestinians rejected a peace plan put forth by 
defense minister yitzhak rabin 
the plan which government officials said was rabins personal 
idea called for elections of palestinian leaders in the occupied 
territories followed by direct negotiations between israel jordan 
and the new palestinian leadership 
it mirrors israeli proposals dating back to 1977 which the plo 
and other palestinians have repeatedly turned down 
rabin said the future settlement could resemble a swissstyle 
confederation with an automomous palestinian district within the 
jewish state 
he called the potential palestinian leadership our partners for 
peace but added that israel will wait until the palestinian 
uprising ends before holding elections israel tv reported 
hilmi hanoun mayor of tulkarem in the west bank said the plan 
was another attempt to replace the plo with israelicontrolled 
leaders 
we have got our leadership in the plo and want to tell mr 
rabin that if he wants peace he knows where to go said 
hanoun 
in baghdad plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman rejected the idea of 
autonomy saying the uprising opened the door wide for a real 
peace based on complete israeli withdrawal and the establishment 
of an independent palestinian state 
rabin added one new detail friday to a tougher policy against 
palestinian protesters introduced earlier in the week israel radio 
quoted him as saying troops now will be able to shoot plastic 
bullets at people blocking roads with stones a favorite tactic in 
the uprising 
the closure of schools for 300000 west bank students was 
announced by the army after an upsurge in violent protests that 
authorities say often began in schoolyards 
an official of the the west bank military government who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said the closure was indefinite but might 
be reconsidered in a few days if protests stop 
schools in the west bank were closed for 10 months before 
reopening in december 
the uprising is the most sustained since israel captured the west 
bank and gaza strip from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east 
war 
most of the palestinian victims died in clashes with soldiers 
but more than a dozen have been killed as suspected collaborators by 
fellow arabs 
two deaths of alleged collaborators were reported friday 
ahmed jeredat 36 was killed by a shot in the face in the west 
bank village of atil on thursday night and 18yearold mohammed irut 
died friday of wounds suffered in a shooting jan 12 in the central 
market in nablus arab reporters said 
the reporters said jeredat was a shopkeeper who cooperated with 
the military government and irut was from a family with links to 
israeli authorities in nablus balata neighborhood 
army officials confirmed jeredats death and listed a palestinian 
from balata who died of earlier wounds but they did not have his 
name

george bush opened his presidency friday with a 
tribute to the man he served for eight years and a declaration of an 
american mission to make kinder the face of the nation and 
gentler the face of the world 
he delivered an inaugural address of dedication and inspiration 
lacking any specific political agenda but calling on his countrymen 
to rise above materialism and to engage in a new activism 
handson and involved that gets the job done 
to the democratic leaders of congress the new republican 
president said i am putting out my hand to you 
to the world he said we offer new engagement and a renewed 
vow we will stay strong to protect the peace 
the speech drew glowing reviews from democrats 
bush is extending the hand of friendship and we intend to 
extend ours in return said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine the democratic leader said he would respond to 
the bush address with a speech on the senate floor on wednesday 
he repeated the themes hes been stating since the election 
cooperation and conciliation said house majority leader thomas 
foley dwash it is all very well received and congress will 
respond with an equal effort and attitude 
jesse jackson joined the chorus of praise saying the speech was 
characterized by hope and by reaching out to the loyal 
opposition 
bush took the oath of office as the nations 41st president at 
three minutes after noon his hand resting on two bibles one a 
bush family bible and the other used 200 years earlier when george 
washington took the same oath 
the simple ceremony on the inaugural stand on the west front of 
the us capitol took place before an audience that included former 
rivals within his own party as well as the democratic members of 
congress with whom he must work 
around the country and the world millions watched the change of 
power on television 
bush opened his inaugural address with a tribute to ronald 
reagan a man who had earned a lasting place in our hearts and 
in our history 
president reagan on behalf of our nation i thank you for the 
wonderful things you have done for america 
the assembled crowd burst into applause bush turned away from 
the microphone to face his predecessor and joined in the applause 
as he moved on to set the tone for the start of his 
administration bush described a nation in a peaceful and 
prosperous time he added but we can make it better 
a new breeze is blowing he said and a world refreshed by 
freedom seems reborn a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready 
to push on there is new ground to be broken and new action to be 
taken 
the 64yearold president questioned whether the nation had grown 
too materialistic 
we are not the sum of our possessions he said they are 
not the measure of our lives what do we want the men and women 
who work with us to say when we are no longer there that we were 
more driven to succeed than anyone around us or that we stopped to 
ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment to trade 
a word of friendship 
america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high 
moral purpose he said we as a people have such a purpose 
today it is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the 
face of the world 
he cited the homelessness drugs crime and unwed mothers as 
national problems 
the old solution the old way was to think that public money 
alone could end these problems said bush but we have learned 
that is not so and in any case our funds are low we have a 
deficit to bring down we have more will than wallet but will is 
what we need 
he reecalled a term he used in the acceptance speech he delivered 
in august in new orleans when he became the gop nominee to succeed 
reagan a thousand points of light 
he said these were all the community organizations that are 
spread like stars throughout the nation doing good 
in his appeal for greater cooperation between the administration 
and congress bush said our great parties have too often been far 
apart and untrusting of each other he blamed the vietnam war 
which he said cleaves us still 
but friends that war began in earnest a quarter century ago 
and surely the statute of limitations has been reached this is a 
fact the final lesson of vietnam is that no great nation can long 
afford to be sundered by a memory 
in offering his hand to the democratic leaders of congress bush 
cited the need to reach a budget compromise and said let us 
negotiate soon and hard but in the end let us produce 
he told other nations that the offered hand is a reluctant 
fist but the fist once made is strong and can be used with great 
effect 
the new president concluded his inaugural address by saying i 
do not mistrust the future i do not fear what is ahead for our 
problems are large but our heart is larger our challenges are 
great but our will is greater and if our flaws are endless gods 
love is truly boundless 
after bidding goodbye to the reagans bush in his first act as 
president signed a proclamation making sunday a national day of 
prayer and thanksgiving and the nominations for his cabinet and 
other highlevel jobs 
he distributed a handful of the the pens he used to the 
congressional leaders who joined him and saved the remainder for the 
nominees 
the ceremony attended by first lady barbara bush took place in 
the ornate presidents room where lincoln signed the mancipation 
proclamation and former president lyndon johnson signed the 1964 
civil rights act 
as he was leaving bush was asked about parting from reagan 
i was trying to keep the tears from running down my cheeks 
after eight years of friendship it was pretty tough bush said

president bush and his wife barbara took a 
page from president carters book friday when to the delight of 
thousands of spectators they jumped out of their armorplated 
limousine and walked part of the inaugural parade route 
a squeal went up from the crowd lining constitution avenue at the 
start of the parade as the first couple emerged from their car 
nearly half a block after leaving the capitol prompting some 
paradewatchers to run after the motorcade 
the bushes walking behind the limousine in the middle of the 
street waved robustly and the crowds returned the salute with 
gusto shouting enthusiastically secret service agents walked 
alongside the bushes but did not block the crowds view 
the bushes returned to the car after about two blocks along 
constitution but then they got out again as the parade moved up 
pennsylvania avenue 
they walked with long fast strides waving and smiling gleefully 
before they returned to the car at 13th street and pennsylvania 
where thousands were gathered at a plaza known as freedom square 
police estimated the total parade crowd at 300000 
the bushes stepped out of the vehicle one last time when it 
arrived at the white house and mrs bush followed by her husband 
dashed into the crowd they remained for only a few moments before 
returning to the street to walk the final halfblock to the 
reviewing stand filled with many of the new presidents friends and 
contributors 
in 1977 carter and his wife rosalynn walked nearly the entire 
1mile parade route 
jody powell carters press secretary said in a recent interview 
that carter told him about his plans the week before the 
inauguration but the news was very tightly held for security 
purposes 
what he told me at the time was the deal was the secret service 
wasnt going to fight it as long as it was kept secret but if word 
got out ahead of time theyd be very opposed to it powell said 
secret service spokesman rich adams said earlier this week that 
the agents would be prepared to protect bush if he decided to stroll 
rather than ride but he admitted that the agents would not be too 
happy about it 
if we had our way he would not leave the white house adams 
said 
the agent had refused to disclose whether bush might be planning 
such a jaunt 
contacted friday while the parade was in progress adams said 
guess hes doing it 
he said he was not told whether the bushes walk had been 
discussed with the secret service in advance and that he did not 
know if the detail protecting the bushes had been told 
were prepared for that anticipating him getting out of the 
vehicle and as you can see it became reality he said 
security for the inaugural ceremonies at the capitol was tight 
with sharpshooters deployed on nearby rooftops us capitol police 
officer dan nichols said 
some 200000 people were on the capitol grounds 142000 with 
tickets to the ceremonies and 60000 lining the streets but there 
were no problems and no arrests nichols said 
all 142000 who viewed the ceremonies were checked with a 
magnetometer and handbags and cameras were scrutinized carefully by 
uniformed secret service agents some larger pieces that could not 
be given a thorough inspection visually were examined by canine 
explosive detection teams which had swept the entire area before the 
ceremonies began nichols said 
none of the people being subjected to security checks objected 
he said adding the crowds seem to be very receptive 
because of the day and age and how security is people become 
accustomed to these kind of checks he said i dont think 
people mind at all it gives them a sense of security im sure they 
can feel more at ease knowing everyone around them has been 
screened

lech walesa said friday the communist 
partys offer to legalize solidarity doesnt go far enough but hes 
willing to talk with the government because poland needs it so 
badly 
seeing all the needs and necessities i will try to do 
everything on my side to begin talks about poland at the round table 
as soon as possible walesa said after a 90minute rally with 
hundreds of workers inside the gdansk shipyard where the soviet 
blocs only independent trade union was founded in 1980 
walesa emphasized that the unions official position must await a 
weekend meeting of the solidarity national executive commission 
i will reach toward agreement i dont know if i will make it 
but i will try he said i will want to take advantage of all 
chances for agreement for poland because we need it so badly time 
really presses us 
after a stormy twoday session of the party central committee 
gen wojciech jaruzelski on thursday announced conditions could be 
negotiated to reinstate solidarity which has been banned since 
martial law was imposed in 1981 
the governments dramatic change in course contained in a 
position paper allowing for political and trade union freedoms 
appears to be an effort to bring the opposition into the battle to 
reverse the economic decline that has left poland with chronic 
shortages a mounting foreign debt and a dispirited populace 
walesa noted the nations deepening troubles saying in 
connection with all that it is more difficult that in 1980 to do 
everything 
but we also have gained some experience he continued i am 
an optimist although we will face very difficult things 
walesa said the legalization offer is a bandaid with the 
party going only as far as it had to due to the pressing crisis but 
no further 
it is very much of a change for the party i repeat very 
much he said but as it goes for social expectations it is a 
little bit too little you may say it is only what is necessary 
for today it is like a bandaid for today 
jaruzelski said the offer was honest and represented a 
momentous event for poland 
the party position was printed in newspapers nationwide friday 
and jaruzelskis thursday news conference was broadcast on radio and 
television there also were short reports on walesas views 
under the government proposal new unions must obey the law and 
accept no financial support from the west the resolution does not 
contain a timetable for legalization or call on new unions to 
refrain from striking but party leaders have suggested a twoyear 
trial period with no strikes 
alfred miodowicz head of the only legal trade union alliance 
warned friday that rankandfile workers are not ready for the 
changes and said they could result in unrest at factories 
the situation is very tense in the country and i think we are 
facing very serious events in enterprises he said 
however although he voted against the party proposal at the 
central committee meeting he appeared resigned to having more than 
one union at work places 
i think this is the best solution because people in enterprises 
know how to organize themselves he said 
a commentary in the warsaw daily zycie warszawy said poland is 
entering a qualitatively new state of transformations of her 
political system 
a factory party committee leader interviewed on the radio said 
the new course was received poorly by a lot or even a majority of 
comrades but that he expected views to change after discussions 
jaruzelski said the government is ready to start discussions it 
proposed during an august wave of strikes the worst in seven years 
legalization of solidarity has been a condition for the banned 
unions participation 
jaruzelski said that as long as solidarity respected the law of 
the socialist state the other details of legalization could be 
negotiated during the talks 
walesa said friday he was checking technical matters 
concerning the talks and legalization in addition to preparing for 
discussions with the executive commission known by its polish 
initials kkw so that we can reach agreement in order to solve 
problems 
theres minimal things that are big for some and small for 
others he said i cant speak for the kkw but i personally will 
do everything possible to take advantage of these chances 
walesa addressed workers in a dining hall at the lenin shipyard 
where he returned to his job as an electrician this week following a 
disability leave 
when a worker asked walesa how he could believe the authorities 
after 40 years of lying and cheating he replied of course i 
could shout hang the communists i am capable of doing it but 
that is not the point i am here to solve with you different 
problems of the shipyard and the country 
i dont trust them authorities either but if someone gives 
me a chance for pluralism i take this chance walesa added 
if we are really getting economic social and political 
pluralism it would mean breaking down the monopoly and thats 
the point he said 
the rally lasted longer than expected because workers had many 
questions not only about the legalization offer but also about 
their futures under a government plan to liquidate the yard as 
unprofitable

while george bush was sworn in as president friday 
a subdued michael dukakis watched on television eating a tuna 
sandwich and sharing his disappointment with his staff 
id be less than candid if i didnt say id like to be the guy 
raising his hand and taking the oath of office today dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor who was faulted for his impersonal 
campaign style showed little emotion on inauguration day other than 
to acknowledge that he felt disappointed its his day dukakis 
said 
dukakis who has not ruled out another white house run in 1992 
credited bush with a good speech the defeated democrat said he 
sensed bush was reaching out to democrats and welcomed bushs 
attention to the problems of drug abuse and homelessness 
in a telegram sent to the white house on friday dukakis offered 
congratulations and best wishes 
i am sure that other members of my party were touched as i was 
by the sense of optimism the call to duty and the generosity of 
spirit by which you called on all of us in your inaugural address to 
work together to eradicate homelessness wipe out the scourge of 
drugs that poisons our children and build a stronger more secure 
america dukakis wrote 
talking to reporters afterward dukakis said he felt proud of the 
american political system for its stability and orderly transition 
to a new administration 
i wish him well and look forward to working with him the 
governor said one of the great things about this system of ours 
is the transfer of power peacefully 
dukakis who was invited to the inaugural ceremonies said he 
chose not to attend because he had work to do in massachusetts 
where the 116 billion budget is at least 600 million out of 
balance

exiled ugandan dictator idi amin has 
dropped out of sight since leaving his home in saudi arabia two 
weeks ago and may be hiding in zaire arab diplomatic sources said 
friday 
the sources said on condition of anonymity that they believed 
amin still was in kinshasa the capital of zaire they had no 
information on reports that he left for the saudi port of jiddah on 
wednesday 
the report that amin left kinshasa has not been confirmed and 
we believe he is still there to the best of our knowledge amin 
has not returned to jiddah said an arab diplomat reached by 
telephone in the saudi capital riyadh 
the former ugandan leader has lived in saudi arabia since his 
overthrow in 1979 amin 61 first arrived in zaire jan 3 on a 
false passport he was expelled on jan 12 to dakar senegal from 
there he was expected to be returned to saudi arabia but ended up 
on a flight back to zaire 
the diplomat said saudi officials were angry with amin for 
leaving the country on forged travel documents and refused him 
reentry into the country 
he said the former dictator long has been unpopular with his 
saudi hosts for meddling in african politics and for his links with 
ugandans opposed to the current government there 
in past telephone calls from jiddah to the associated press 
bureau in bahrain amin made it clear he hoped to recapture power 
with the help of supporters and relatives in uganda 
amin was ousted from his east african nation in april 1979 and 
was granted political asylum in saudi arabia in 1980 after the 
libyan government of col moammar gadhafi refused to harbor him 
during eight years of tyranny tens of thousands of amins 
political opponents were killed and newspaper reports alleged that 
he practiced cannibalism the reports were never independently 
verified 
saudi businessmen acquainted with amin said they had no idea of 
his whereabouts but insisted he has not returned to saudi arabia 
even if he gets back to saudi arabia it will be quite a while 
before we and the africans here know about it said one jiddah 
businessman who identified himself only as a close friend of the 
amin family 
saudi officials could not be reached for comment because of the 
moslem sabbath on friday 
idi amins whereabouts are becoming a mystery officials 
are tightlipped and there is no stir in the african community and 
asian diplomatic circles here said a jiddah hotel manager who 
said amin used to visit him regularly 
the hotel manager said amin left jiddah with one of his sons and 
that his second wife and 22 other children still were in their 
guarded villa halfway between jiddah airport and the city

aaron and joshua landez are twins who will 
celebrate their birthdays 12 days apart 
the brothers who were in good condition friday at humana womens 
hospital were born separately when doctors decided joshua needed 
more development in the womb following his brothers birth more than 
two months prematurely on jan 5 
to have one baby and still be pregnant sounds like a national 
enquirer headline said the twins mother norma landez but after 
aaron was born she said i could tell joshua was growing more 
quickly 
aaron weighed only 2 pounds 6 ounces at birth and had to be 
placed on a respirator doctors concerned about the development of 
the other babys lungs used surgery and medication to delay 
joshuas birth until tuesday 
he weighed 3 pounds 7 ounces at birth 
they decided that it was best for him inside the mom 
hospital spokeswoman cathy collier said those extra 12 days 
enabled him to be born without a respirator 
both babies were delivered naturally doctors said 
we have seen a few hours go by between first birth and the 
second but we have never seen days go by and ive been practicing 
for 20 years said dr melvin baden the newborn specialist caring 
for the twins 
however dr mark paine landezs obstetrician said the 
procedure was being used more frequently in europe where twins have 
been delivered as much as five weeks apart 
the infants are expected to remain in the hospital another week 
or two until they weigh at least 4 pounds 8 ounces each

president it makes me feel good all over he said 
and the interest was bipartisan 
im not really a republican confessed 17yearold william 
merkle of woodbridge va i just came to see all the hype and 
hysteria ive never been to something like this 
pockets of demonstrators aired their dissenting views along the 
parade route with chants and signs such as keep abortion legal 
and era yes 
four washington women marched behind the crowds with signs 
protesting the extravagance of the days festivities 
three of the women wore rubber masks of ronald and nancy reagan 
and george bush one woman commented this is pretty much like a 
coronation in a monarchy the only difference is george bush isnt 
ronald reagans son 
the bustling avenue and mild temperatures were a sharp contrast 
to the festivities of four years earlier when frigid temperatures 
forced the cancellation of the inaugural parade for only the second 
time in history 
the inaugural parade evolved from what originally was a 
ceremonial escort of the newly swornin president from the capitol 
to his new digs at the white house 
as the processions got more and more elaborate they took on a 
life of their own this years extravaganza involved more than 
10000 marchers floatriders and equestrian units and there were 
another 10 bands performing at fixed sites along the parade to 
entertain spectators during the lulls 
the procession started about 45 minutes late prompting some 
creative cheers from the anxious crowds on constitution avenue the 
cry was wheres george a play on the slogan that democrats 
coined at their convention this summer 
at another point spectators on the two sides of pennsylvania 
avenue chanted back and forth tastes great and less 
filling the punch lines from a beer commercial

a sri lankan whose illegal stay in britain was 
ended by a police raid on his church refuge flew out of britain on 
friday deported to his homeland 
police said they arrested seven protesters during a noisy 
demonstration at gatwick airport near london as vijay mendis 32 
was deported on the 1245 pm air lanka flight to colombo 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual leader of the 
church of england told his flock to obey the law after home 
secretary douglas hurd told the church to be cautious about 
sheltering people who were breaking it 
in a statement from his lambeth palace official residence runcie 
said it was regrettable that hurd authorized the forcible removal of 
mendis from the church but that parliament had abolished the legal 
right of sanctuary in churches in 1623 
the cleric said many people in the anglican state church were 
uneasy about britains immigration policy but however 
objectionable a particular law may be everyone in a democracy must 
obey it or accept the consequences of disobeying it 
hurd who is responsible for police and immigration spoke to the 
house of commons hours after police smashed into a vestry of the 
church of the ascension in the northern city of manchester to seize 
mendis on wednesday 
mendis had lived in the vestry since 1986 to resist deportation 
and was looked after by wellwishers he arrived in britain in 1973 
as a student 
mendis belongs to sri lankas buddhist sinhalese majority hurd 
rejected his claim that he faces persecution or death for his 
political support for communism and the minority tamils most of 
whom are hindus 
tamil extremists have been fighting government forces for a 
separate nation in the north of the island nation off southeast 
india 
mark brown spokesman for the mendis defense campaign said he 
saw mendis in prison thursday night and mendis told him make no 
mistake if i die it was douglas hurd who pulled the trigger 
in colombo foreign ministry secretary w t jayesinghe said i 
dont think anything is going to happen to mendis when he arrives 
west germanys london embassy said the state of bremen was ready 
to accept mendis proceedings were not completed in time however 
and the home office said its noon deadline for a firm undertaking by 
another country was not met 
more than 1000 campaigners to keep mendis here sat down in the 
center of manchester friday night bringing commuter traffic to a 
halt

the government said friday it will 
allow the united states to replace diplomats expelled from managua 
in july and said it was ending the dispute as a gesture to the bush 
administration 
foreign minister miguel descoto called john leonard charge 
daffaires for the us embassy here just as president bush was 
being inaugurated to tell him nicaragua will begin immediately 
issuing visas for us diplomats 
after a 90minute meeting with leonard descoto told reporters 
that todays decision was a very generous measure by the 
sandinista government 
it is a unilateral decision designed to normalize bilateral 
relations with mutual respect he said 
the leftist government also waived a 15day waiting period for 
visas 
leonard told reporters the new administration is going to 
consider the decision before commenting on it we are going to 
see what our visa needs are he said 
the gestures are believed to be the first conciliatory overture 
by either country toward the other since former secretary of state 
george p shultz visited managua 4 years ago 
relations between nicaragua and the united states were strained 
throughout the reagan administration because of us support for the 
antisandinista rebels known as contras 
the nicaraguan gesture comes during uncertainty about what policy 
the bush administration plans for nicaragua secretary of 
statedesignate james baker said during his confirmation hearings 
last week that he will attempt to forge a bipartisan policy on that 
issue but gave no details 
congress suspended aid to the contras in february over strenuous 
reagan administration objections the bush administration has given 
no indication it plans to seek to resume such aid 
the usnicaraguan conflict over accrediting diplomats dates 
back to july 11 when nicaragua ordered home us ambassador richard 
melton and seven other us envoys on grounds they were interfering 
in nicaraguas internal affairs 
the united states retaliated by expelling eight nicaraguan envoys 
from washington including ambassador carlos tunnermann 
when the state department submitted a list of envoys to 
sandinista authorities as replacements for the expelled diplomats 
nicaragua refused to give them visas 
the sandinistas contended that the united states had acted beyond 
its authority in expelling tunnermann who served both as ambassador 
to the us and to the organization of american states 
sandinista officials contended that the state department had no 
right to expel an envoy accredited to an international organization 
subsequently the sandinistas refused to allow the remaining us 
diplomats in nicaragua the right to return immediately when they 
left the country either on official or personal business 
instead the sandinistas insisted on a waiting period of 15 
working days

six women who frequented bars in the same 
neighborhood have been slashed to death over the past 3 years and 
detectives friday said they believe a serial killer may be 
responsible 
were not saying it is a serial killer but if its one person 
we want to stop it before there is another victim said police 
spokesman capt richard delise 
none of the victims was alive when discovered no motive has been 
found and no links between victims other than the neighborhood have 
been established 
so far the clues are few and the trail is slim delise said 
the latest victim was a 30yearold woman found in the kitchen of 
her tiny thirdfloor apartment on thursday she was nude except for 
a pair of white socks there were deep slash marks on her chest 
arms and head 
police said theresa sciortina had been sexually assaulted and 
probably also beaten with a threefoot piece of wood the fight 
moved from one room to another and there was a large amount of 
bleeding said homicide lt james henwood 
the victims range in age from 28 to 68 four visited the golden 
bar in the citys frankford section and police suspect they might 
have met the killer there 
the first victim a 52yearold woman was found in 1985 stabbed 
47 times and sexually assaulted one victim found under a truck in 
1987 had been stabbed more than 74 times severely beaten in the 
face and sexually assaulted 
you have multiple stabbings you have women who have been known 
to frequent the same bars in one neighborhood and all the victims 
were slashed numerous times delise said 
it is the same kind of mo and too much of a coincidence to 
ignore so thats where the investigation appears to be headed

new complications and he no longer required the use of oxygen to 
assist his breathing 
his vital signs remain constant and there have been no changes 
in treatment punsati said 
he said the prognosis remained extremely critical and that 
barring any significant changes the next medical statement would be 
issued saturday morning 
dalis lawyer robert descharnes told the spanish news agency efe 
he was pessimistic about the artists condition and that dali 
appeared to be much worse than when he entered the quiron clinic in 
barcelona last november 
in his regard you can see the strength and extraordinary will 
to go on living and you can see a certain lucidity descharnes 
said but this does not contradict the grave crisis through which 
he is passing 
dali has been hospitalized three times since late november 
he was taken from his galatea tower home in this northeastern 
spanish town to the intensive care unit of figueras hospital early 
wednesday after his condition deteriorated 
he had been hospitalized for 16 days in the quiron clinic because

congress paid tribute to the nations 17th 
republican president on friday but 46 of the 59 house and senate 
members lifting crystal champagne glasses to toast the newly 
inaugurated george bush were not gop loyalists but opposition 
democrats 
both the house and senate have democratic majorities but the 
heavy tilt of the inaugural luncheon guest list suggested an effort 
by the new president to reach out to the opposition just as he said 
he would do in his inaugural address minutes before 
it is the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of the first 
american president and a large early oil portrait of george 
washington hung immediately behind bushs chair at the main table in 
historic statuary hall 
an ensemble from the smithsonian institution all of them playing 
antique instruments performed light 18th century airs all of which 
are known to have been played for washington 
orchids roses poppies and other flowers spilled from vases set 
on white fluted columns to the side and in the center of each table 
seated at tables of 10 each were members of congress bushs 
designated cabinet nominees and other officials and their spouses 
the menu lobster scallop ragout grilled poussin four grain 
pilaf asparagus brandied pear crisp and vanilla ice cream 
reported to be bushs favorite dessert 
when lunch was done the toasts were in order 
sen wendell ford dky chairman of the congressional inagural 
arrangements committee noted that in a room down the hall 25 of 
bushs grandchildren and the children of others in attendance were 
dining with far less elegance but perhaps with as much 
satisfaction 
their menu grilled cheese sandwiches chicken nuggets fresh 
fruit and milk 
i have checked mr president and at their luncheon there was 
no talk of politics ford said 
he then raised his glass of korbel california champagne and 
offered a toast to your good health and long life with your lady 
at your side 
bush sprang to his feet in response calling his inaugural the 
peoples day and noting that when the house sergeantatarms had 
a few moments earlier addressed him as mr president he had 
not responded thinking the remarks were addressed to former 
president reagan 
he was soon restored to reality 
i felt something between an affectionate hug and a kidney 
punch he said 
then he explained using a familiar nickname for his 
silverhaired wife barbara it was the silver fox telling me to 
get going 
no politics today bush said turning serious this is 
going to be a very special day for the country its a wonderful way 
to start this presidency 
he then toasted the house and the senate 
it was an occasion of giftgiving and bush got four and vice 
president dan quayle got one 
two large mahogany boxes were carried in by waiters in black tie 
and white gloves and opened to reveal two crystal bowls hand carved 
with an etching of the capitol dome on one side an arbor of cherry 
trees on the other 
bush was presented the larger version quayle got the smaller 
just dont drop it please ford said as the presentation to 
bush was made 
house minority leader robert michel of illinois presented bush 
with a plaque on which was mounted one of the letter openers which 
opened the envelopes containing the electoral vote giving bush and 
quayle a total of 426 electoral votes and victory 
michel also presented bush with an engraved portrait of martin 
van buren the last sitting vice president until bush to be elected 
directly from the vice presidency to the presidency 
then it was the turn of house speaker jim wright of texas 
offering a memento of historic significance 
wrights plaque contained two charred bits of wood one from the 
capitol one from the white house with an inscription identifying 
them as parts of the fabric of those buildings burned by british 
raiders on the evening of aug 24 1814 
and he presented it with a description of the commander of the 
british forces climbing with muddy boots in the speakers 
chair and offering a mock resolution to his roistering soldiers 
resolved that this harbor of yankee democracy shall be burned 
the inscription on the plaque reads in part like these great 
american institutions men too can be hammered and forged and 
ultimately strengthened in fire and adversity 
in war and in peace in his tireless service both in the 
legislative and executive branches of our government president bush 
has been tested and tempered and shaped and made strong in 
experience and dedication for the momentous duties he undertakes 
today

us sen alfonse damato on friday recommended 
criminal lawyer otto obermaier as manhattans federal prosecutor 
friday despite objections from the outgoing us attorney rudolph 
w giuliani 
giulian whose crusades against the mob and insidertrading have 
made him a possible contender for mayor said a year ago he would 
oppose obermaier as his successor because several clients of 
obermaiers firm are targets of federal insidertrading 
investigations giuliani put off his resignation because of the 
problem 
giuliani had no comment friday he said last week he would not 
speak publicly about the choice of his successor but would present 
his views to the us justice department which will review 
damatos recommendation 
the nomination is made by the president with senate 
confirmation but presidents generally accept the advice of senators 
in their own party to fill such posts damato is a republican 
obermaier 52 a specialist in whitecollar and securities law 
for nearly 20 years has said he would have no problem with the 
conflict issue raised by giuliani 
i am delighted at being selected he said in a statement i 
look forward to cooperating with the justice department to complete 
the next step 
he did not return a telephone call 
damato in a statement called obermaier one of the most 
distinguished and respected practitioners in new york with 
extensive experience in the federal courts in both civil and 
criminal matters 
damato did not return a telephone call and his spokesman zenia 
mucha would not comment directly on giulianis concern 
damato feels that mr obermaier is qualified is a good 
candidate he came with the highest recommendations hes well 
respected he has a great reputation mucha said and thats 
about all the comment youre going to get from him on that 
giuliani announced last week that he would depart by months end 
he is considering running for mayor 
obermaier cofounded the new york law of obermaier morvillo and 
abramowitz in 1970 his clients have included robert chestman a 
brokerage executive indicted last summer on insider trading and 
perjury charges 
giulianis office has been at the forefront of the wall street 
scandal the past two years prosecuting numerous cases of stock 
manipulation and insider trading involving prominent companies and 
businessmen 
obermaier was quoted in the national law journal in 1987 as 
saying securities violations were being handled too often by 
prosecutors as crimes rather than by the securities and exchange 
commission as civil matters

pravda on friday published previously secret 
sections of the memoirs of world war ii marshal georgy zhukov that 
blast josef stalins war leadership and blame him for the 
annihilation of thousands of soviets 
the memoirs in the communist party daily shattered the soviet 
image of stalin as a war hero the dictator depicted himself as the 
saviour of the soviet union during the war which killed at least 20 
million soviets 
the image has endured despite western studies that blame a large 
part of the soviet losses on stalins purge of the red army officer 
corps in the late 1930s and on his refusal to believe that nazi 
leader adolf hitler could turn on him and order a german invasion 
zhukov was deputy commanderinchief of the soviet armed forces 
during the war second only to stalin himself zhukov is considered 
a hero of the defense of moscow and stalingrad 
pravda quoted zhukovs daughter maria as saying the marshals 
memoirs often have been cited by stalinists as proof that stalin was 
a magnificent leader rather than the criminal portrayed in recent 
soviet publications 
but maria zhukova said key sections of her fathers writings were 
left hidden in his safe for publication at some future less 
dangerous date 
many thousands of outstanding party workers members of the 
armed forces faithful patriots of the motherland and talented 
leaders of the country were annihilated by the order of stalin 
from 1937 to 1939 zhukov wrote of course one cannot forgive 
stalin 
the full page of excerpts in pravda include zhukovs report that 
stalin played no role in directing the war effort although he often 
called frontline commanders to issue orders devised by the general 
staff as if they were his own 
pravda said zhukov wrote an entire chapter on stalins 
repressions of the army but virtually all of it was deleted from 
publication in his original memoirs 
pravda published only a few paragraphs on the subject itself 
instead concentrating on zhukovs memories 
the newspaper said maria zhukova was planning a book based on her 
fathers newly revealed memoirs

china and vietnam had five days of frank and 
friendly talks on the prospects for peace in cambodia and plan to 
meet again soon vietnam said friday 
a vietnamese spokesman said first deputy foreign minister dinh 
nho liem of vietnam returned to his country on friday after the 
secretive talks the first highlevel meeting between china and 
vietnam in more than nine years 
liem discussed vietnams occupation of cambodia with chinese 
foreign minister qian qichen and vice foreign minister liu shuqing 
they also discussed normalization of relations between the two 
countries and other issues of concern the spokesman said in a 
statement 
relations between the two communist countries have been hostile 
since vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 to drive the prochinese 
khmer rouge from power 
the exchange of views between the two sides was useful and took 
place in a frank and friendly atmosphere the spokesman said 
the two sides reached a number of agreements the remaining 
questions will be discussed later 
the vietnamese embassy refused to elaborate on what agreements 
were reached 
the statement said vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach 
will be meeting soon with qian it did not give a specific date 
the chinese foreign ministry declined comment on the meeting 
the vietnamese statement said the nations discussed the 
international aspects of the conflict in cambodia 
the internal aspects of the problem will be settled among the 
cambodian parties themselves the statement said 
vietnam has said it will withdraw all troops from cambodia in 
1990 but said on jan 7 it would pull its forces out by september 
if a political solution could be reached 
but chinas relations with vietnam have been cold since late 
1978 when vietnam toppled the khmer rouge in cambodia the 
ultraradical khmer rouge had ruled cambodia since 1975 in a bloody 
reign that left at least 1 million dead 
beijing attacked vietnam in early 1979 to punish it for 
invading cambodia talks between the two countries ended in december 
1979 
vietnam still insists on measures to prevent the khmer rouge from 
returning to power china has refused to exclude the khmer rouge 
from a future cambodian government but has said it is willing to 
reduce its assistance to the khmer rouge and other guerrilla forces 
as vietnam pulls out 
vietnam says it has about 50000 troops in cambodia western 
diplomats say the actual number is far larger 
meanwhile prime minister hun sen of cambodia arrived in bangkok 
on friday for weekend talks with prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
of thailand thai government spokesman suvit yodmani said the 
oneonone talks may help quicken the pace of peace to 
everyones advantage 
foreign ministers from nations belonging to the association of 
southeast asian nations also plan to discuss cambodia this weekend 
during a meeting in bandar seri begawan brunei 
malaysian foreign minister abu hasssan omar said friday he feels 
that a solution to the cambodian conflict can be found this year 
he said it seems the time is right the situation with regards 
to the superpowers is warming up certainly there is a warming 
up of relations between the superpowers 
the attitude of vietnam itself is favorable towards a peaceful 
settlement and with all this we are very hopeful for a solution

as george bush headed across the capitol on 
friday to bid farewell to ronald reagan it took a sharp nudge from 
his wife barbara to remind him that from now on hes the one who 
answers to mr president 
the new president recounted that moment at a luncheon with 
leaders of congress following the inaugural ceremony on the 
redcarpeted terrace of the west front of the capitol there he had 
taken the same oath to defend the constitution that george 
washington swore 200 years ago 
bush said that following his journey with reagan up and down the 
capitols labyrinth of steps the sergeant of arms of the house 
said mr president and im standing there waiting for president 
reagan and i feel something that was between an affectionate hug 
and a kidney punch the silver fox telling me to get going 
no one had to tell bush to get going at the start of this day 
when the nations 43rd vice president became its 41st president 
guess who was up first barbara bush aka the silver 
fox asked reporters he got up at 6 am 
that was no small feat in their temporary quarters at blair 
house the government guest house across the street from the white 
house which was teeming with bush children and grandchildren 
the 64yearold bush ever the early riser and a creature of 
habit apparently held fast to the schedule he scribbled beforehand 
on a note pad for his press secretary 
6 am catch 3 news shows 
drink coffee 
play with grand kids 
pray 
go to whouse 
go to cap hill 
get sworn in 
the prayers came at st johns episcopal church the church of 
the presidents across lafayette park from the white house 
at the private service for the bushes and dan quayle and his 
wife marilyn the rev john c harper said we look to our 
elected leaders to fulfill the law of love in their deeds 
as the bushes departed the organist played onward christian 
soldiers bush said afterwards he had prayed for strength 
strength and peace 
at midmorning the reagans played white house hosts for the final 
time inviting the bushes and quayles to the blue room for coffee 
and pastries 
eight years earlier reagan and bush wore formal morning suits 
and ascots to reagans first inauguration but on this day bush was 
wearing a dark gray pinstripe business suit and reagan and quayle 
were in similar attire 
reagan in a farewell visit to the oval office had left behind a 
handwritten note on the presidents desk wishing bush well 
the president and the soontobe president rode together up the 
milelong pennsylvania avenue route that bush later traversed in the 
opposite direction at the head of the inaugural parade part of it 
on foot like jimmy carter in 1977 
the planners of these ceremonies had boasted beforehand that bush 
would start the oath of office at precisely 115945 am est so 
that it would be exactly noon when he finished with the words so 
help me god 
they were off by three minutes 
on the platform on the capitols recently refurbished west front 
the ceremony was to start at 1130 am it was 1135 am when 
barbara bush was announced with a fanfare she was resplendent in a 
torquoise coat with no hat the reagans were announced at 1138 
am quayle at 1142 am and finally the vice president of the 
united states bush himself at 1146 am 
they all emerged through an archway draped in red bunting said to 
be similar to that used on federal hall in new york city when 
washington was inaugurated in april 1789 
it was only as he cleared the archway that he could see the 
entire crowd 200000 strong stretched across the capitols lawns 
onto parts of the mall and packed densely along pennsylvania avenue 
most of the nearly 1000 dignitaries lawmakers and relatives 
with platform tickets sat in ordinary gray folding chairs but there 
were four big brown easy chairs for bush quayle reagan and sen 
wendell ford dky the master of ceremonies 
billy graham gave the invocation and the sweet voices of the 
harlan boys choir intoned this is my country bush and quayle 
like reagan came out in topcoats but bush doffed his before he 
spoke 
it was cold and cloudy as bush took the oath space heaters at 
the foot of a bulletproof glass screen provided some warmth around 
the rostrum 
mrs dorothy bush the 87yearold mother of the new president 
had a fur on and someone lent her a second one to use as a blanket 
for her knees she was one of the last to leave the platform helped 
up the steps by a military officer and friend and later got a kiss 
and a few words from her son 
it was 1158 am when quayle finished taking his oath and at 
high noon army staff sgt alvy r powell was belting out god 
bless america 
as he sang one of bushs granddaughters came bolting out of the 
red archway and down the steps to the lap of her father george her 
grandmother turned smiled and signaled for silence with a finger 
across her lips 
a few seconds before 1203 bush began repeating the oath after 
supreme court chief justice william rehnquist mrs bush held two 
bibles a family bible and the same bible used at washingtons 
inauguration open to the beatitudes of st matthew blessed are 
the poor 
he and barbara waved and he prepared to speak but ford stopped 
him to lean into the microphone and announce ladies and 
gentlemen the president of the united states 
bush began with a tribute to reagan and then a prayer and then 
he spoke for 20 minutes from democracys front porch about 
the new breeze blowing across this country and this world 
the lawmakers behind him on the folding chairs listened 
attentively they applauded when bush declared we have work to 
do and talked of the poor and homeless 
at 1225 pm his speech was over powell came back to sing the 
national anthem and the ceremony ended 
on the other side of the capitol the bushes and reagans hugged 
shook hands and waved then the reagans boarded a marine helicopter 
for the start of the trip home to california 
i was trying to keep the tears from running down my cheeks 
after eight years of friendship it was pretty tough bush said 
afterwards 
inside the capitol bush went to the ornate presidents room to 
sign a proclamation making sunday a national day of prayer and 
thanksgiving and to send congress the formal batch of nominations 
for his cabinet and other highlevel jobs 
the parade got off to a late start after lunch the bushes got 
out of their limousine several times to wave to the crowd before he 
was finally ensconced in the threestory reviewing stand outside 
1600 pennsylvania avenue 
bush planned to bring his grandchildren into the oval office on 
saturday basically its dad showing off the new car said 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
this day that began before dawn for bush would not end until well 
after midnight when he completed the rounds of all 11 inaugural 
balls 
but this night he would sleep in the white house and learn to 
answer regularly to mr president

an american scholar says he was was leafing 
through sheets of music in a hungarian archive when he realized he 
was looking at the missing pieces of a neverperformed concerto by 
franz liszt 
it was this kind of moment of discovery when you know youre 
holding in your hand something significant to the music world that 
was a pretty exciting moment musicologist jay rosenblatt recalled 
friday of his april discovery 
he has assembled the scattered pieces and said the work will 
premier in the chicago symphony orchestras 198990 season 
the newly restored concerto can be dated with some confidence 
to 1839 when liszt was in his late 20s rosenblatt said 
it begins somewhat mysteriously but ends in a kind of a 
joyful triumphant manner he said there is much in it that is 
beautiful and much in it that is imaginative 
pieces of the concerto had been scattered in nuremburg west 
germany and weimar east germany where rosenblatt was winding up 
six months of work on a dissertation 
when he visited the hungarian archive in budapest last april he 
examined photocopies of manuscripts in liszts own hand the copies 
had been sent from leningrad in the soviet union where the 
originals are kept 
i leafed to the middle of the document to see what was there 
and i recognized the music said rosenblatt 33 a new york city 
native and doctoral candidate at the university of chicago 
what he found was a concerto for piano and orchestra concerto 
opus posthumous is the working title the concerto apparently was 
reduced to fragments shortly after the composers death in 1886 
there were many manuscripts at his home in weimar and it 
appears that his housekeeper offered them to students and friends 
as a result liszt manuscripts can be found all over the world 
rosenblatt said 
concert pianist jerome lowenthal told the new york times the 
concerto is a real work of liszt in that it has immediately the 
thumbprint of that elegant ironical genius 
the piece had been mentioned in 1982 by liszt scholar michael 
saffle who found a manuscript at weimar that apparently was a draft 
of an unknown concerto but the solo parts of the weimar manuscript 
a copyists version were blank 
scholars in budapest had not seen the weimar document but 
rosenblatt had and made the connection immediately 
the manuscript in leningrad was liszts original handwritten 
version but it was missing a few pages one page has since been 
found in nuremberg and two were discovered in weimar combining all 
four sources every note is accounted for 
the hungarians are compiling a new edition of liszts complete 
works and the publisher edito musica budapest agreed to let 
rosenblatt edit the concerto 
weve got a situation here where even though the manuscript 
existed as a complete entity at one time it no longer exists as 
such rosenblatt said therefore the work only exists in my 
edition its a kind of legal fiction 
it was the timing on many many levels that made this all 
possible he said noting the new era of openness between the 
united states and soviet bloc nations

morton thiokol conducted the last of 
six fullscale tests of its redesigned space shuttle booster friday 
firing the rocket in conditions colder than those that contributed 
to the challenger disaster 
the 126foot booster its 11 million pounds of solid propellent 
chilled to a coldestever 40 degrees fahrenheit burned from a 
horizontal position for 125 seconds at the companys wasatch 
operations 25 miles west of here 
the bright orange plume from the tail erased the snow from a 
hillside during the test which was delayed 90 minutes by a lack of 
wind to blow away dust from the blast some 300 company and space 
officials cheered as the rocket ignited 
if posttest analysis turns up no serious problems the test will 
qualify the rocket for coldweather launches although further 
testing on a smaller scale is planned said allan mcdonald vice 
president of engineering for space operations 
identical boosters already have been used on two shuttle flights 
in the four months since americas return to manned space flight 
we feel very comfortable if this test is successful and we 
expect it will be that we will have really certified this solid 
motor design for the next 20 to 30 years and wheagan and his wife nancy 
returned as private citizens to their beloved california on friday 
having bid farewell to the white house after eight tumultuous years 
at the pinnacle of american power 
when you have to stay eight years away from california except 
for an occasional visit you live in a perpetual state of 
homesickness reagan said at an airport ceremony where he was 
greeted by los angeles mayor tom bradley comedian rich little and 
actor robert stack 
it has been a bittersweet several hours this day reagan told 
a crowd estimated at 700 gathered at los angeles international 
airport to welcome his arrival there arent enough words to say 
what is really in our hearts 
little kidded the former president about having to find a job 
and reagan the former actor quipped that he had a movie deal in 
the works 
i was asked to play a part in a remake of bedtime for bonzo 
only this time they wanted me to play bonzo reagan said he 
wasnt a very freindly type 
during his hollywood days reagan played opposite a meantempered 
chimpanzee in a series of bonzo movies 
as the air force jet made its way across the country the reagans 
served cake and champagne as they hosted a small group of reporters 
for an offtherecord session in what had been the presidential 
cabin in the forward section of the aircraft 
as president it was extremely rare for reagan to mingle with 
reporters flying with him on air force one and it was virtually 
unheard of for any of them to be invited up to his cabin 
the reagans left andrews air force base md at 110 pm est 
and flew home both vowing to pursue objectives they battled for 
during the presidents two terms 
the former first couple waved to a cheering crowd of about 2000 
at andrews and reagan received a 21gun salute as he reviewed a 
platoon from each of the five branches of the military service 
reagan did not address the crowd 
with their dog rex the reagans boarded the plane that in the 
previous eight years would have been designated air force one a 
sign in the crowd read so long gipper 
about an hour earlier reagan stood by as george bush took the 
presidential oath of office at the capitol bush who fought reagan 
tirelessly for the republican presidential nomination in 1980 before 
becoming his vice president turned to reagan after taking the 
presidential oath and said president reagan on behalf of the 
american people i thank you for the wonderful things you have done 
for america 
reagan asked while he was walking with bush through the rotunda 
of the capitol if he felt a sense of relief said no but a great 
pride in whats happening 
following the solemn swearingin ceremonies and bushs acceptance 
speech bush and his wife barbara escorted the reagans to the east 
side of the capitol to a waiting helicopter where they said their 
goodbyes with handshakes and kisses 
as the reagans stood in the doorway of the marine helicopter 
reagan turned and snapped a salute to bush who returned it 
asked by a reporter for his final thoughts reagan said only 
carry on 
the bushes were joined by vice president dan quayle and his wife 
marilyn who waved goodbye to the reagans before their helicopter 
lifted off and made a final sweep of the mall and white house 
old foes at home and abroad praised reagan the first president 
to serve eight years since dwight d eisenhower gave up the office 
to john f kennedy in 1961 
he is according to all external indications leaving office as 
a completely successful political figure said pravda the 
official voice of the soviet union the nation that reagan denounced 
in 1983 as an evil empire 
reagan began his final day in office with a nostalgic visit to 
the oval office to make sure according to his spokesman marlin 
fitzwater that the presidential office was shipshape for his 
successor 
his national security adviser lt gen colin l powell who so 
often briefed reagan there on trouble spots throughout the globe 
told him the world is quiet today mr president 
powells words were relayed to reporters by fitzwater who was 
present during the oval office visit 
then for the last time reagan made the walk through an arched 
colonnade to the executive mansion where he and mrs reagan lived 
and where the bushes will now live 
in a soft voice he called out goodbye to members of the 
white house staff and journalists seeing him off 
fitzwater said the last piece of paper the president signed was a 
letter to british prime minister margaret thatcher thanking her for 
her support in london thatcher saluted the outgoing president as 
a true and perfect gentleman 
the first ladys press secretary elaine crispen said that after 
returning to the executive mansion the president joined his wife in 
walking hand in hand down the central hallway and spending a few 
minutes in the yellow oval room overlooking the washington monument 
and jefferson memorial 
the reagans also said their goodbyes to the domestic staff 
then as their final social duty they offered coffee and 
pastries in the blue room to bush his wife barbara vice 
presidentelect dan quayle his wife marilyn and members of the 
congressional delegation sent to escort them all to the capitol for 
the inauguration 
at the capitol reagan wore a black overcoat and white scarf in 
chilly overcast weather and mrs reagan wore her familiar red coat 
as hail to the chief was played for the last time of the reagan 
presidency 
reagan flew on an air force plane designated sam 27000 it was 
the same plane he had flown thousands of miles on as air force one 
when he was president but air force one is a radio code reserved 
for the plane on which the president flies and is not used when a 
sitting president is not on the plane 
from the los angeles airport the reagans were going by motorcade 
to the home in the fashionable belair neighborhood that they are 
renting from friends who bought it for 25 million the pool of 
reporters assigned to fly with him from washington however were 
not included in the motorcade as they are on presidential trips as 
a private citizen reagan gets to travel without them 
reagan has said he plans to speak out on behalf of causes he has 
long favored such as the line item veto for presidents and repeal 
of the constitutional amendment limiting them to two terms 
mrs reagan has lent her support to a drug abuse treatment center 
planned in a bankrupt hospital at lake view terrace 15 miles north 
of belair on the edge of the angeles national forest

racing the afternoon sun 
westward ronald reagan said friday that he and his wife nancy 
were eager to return to a life we did love very much 
hours after watching george bush take the oath of office as his 
successor the former president and the exfirst lady talked with 
reporters for about 20 minutes midway through the 5hour flight 
from washington to los angeles 
it was hard to say goodbye reagan said adding that leaving 
the white house had been a time of tears for a great many people 
and certainly for us 
on his last morning in the white house he said he had paid a 
final visit to the oval office to see that things he asked be 
shipped to his new home in suburban belair had been taken care of 
it did look pretty bare he commented 
but the future was more on his mind 
returning to california reagan told reporters will mean a 
return to a life we did love very much california isnt a place in 
my mind its a way of life so thats the sweet part of the 
bittersweet experience 
there were 1000 invited guests on hand for a rally after a 
midafternoon landing at los angeles international airport then 
there was a motorcade to the 25 million home bought for them by 
friends 
would there be a rest break he was asked 
listen were just moving into a new house he said we 
didnt get the job done over the holidays when we were there 
when a reporter returned to his visit to oval office and asked 
about his feelings reagan replied theres a nostalgia with all 
of this and it was kind of just that a nostalgic moment of wanting 
to take one more look at the place that every morning ive been 
walking into leaving in the evening and it was just sheer 
nostalgia 
at this point mrs reagan interjected without being asked 
and he never took naps in eight years he never took a nap 
in fact the president added she sometimes gets edgy because 
she thinks i should be able to take a nap 
reagan said he had left a note for bush in the oval office 
just a little one telling him just to carry on and hed be in my 
thoughts and prayers asked if he had any plans to return to 
movies reagan said no there is a kind of a lingering feeling 
that would look a little bit like trying to cash in on this job that 
ive had 
when a reporter pointed out that acting had been his profession 
before politics reagan began well before he could go 
further mrs reagan interjected you dont go back 
the former first lady asked about her eight years in washington 
said the first year was terrible i got off on the wrong 
foot 
later she said people were very kind and it got to the point 
where id say dont say anything nice about me please because 
ill start to cry 
reagan said there were things that i wanted including a 
change in the abortion situation but that you just run out of 
time and thats why i believe i can continue working for those 
things by taking the case to the people 
reporters asked what inheritance he left for bush 
mrs reagan answered a peaceful world reagan added i 
think there is a better relationship worldwide than weve had and 
certainly the economic situation is something different than it was 
when we came here

the names of hospitals with serious problems 
maintaining safety or quality could be revealed to inquiring members 
of the public under a proposal being weighed by a group that sets 
industry standards a spokesman said friday 
at present when accredited hospitals slip in safety or quality 
they are listed as having tentative nonaccreditation but that 
status is concealed from the public said david bushelle of the 
governmentauthorized joint commission on accreditation of 
healthcare organizations 
accreditation a seal of approval qualifies a hospital to 
receive medicare and medicaid benefits which together may total up 
to half a hospitals income 
about 420 of the nations 7000 hospitals fall into the 
tentative nonaccreditation category bushelle said the 
designation allows hospitals up to a year to clean up their act 
before their next inspection and possible loss of accreditation he 
said 
we found this system is too lengthy and inefficient and it 
undermines the credibility of the accreditation process he said 
also hospitals performing satisfactorily and aboveaverage 
hospitals under the old system are all grouped together with 
hospitals that are performing marginally because the joint 
commission identifies all these hospitals as being accredited 
rule changes being considered by the chicagobased commission 
would force hospitals to correct problems faster bushelle said 
they also would allow disclosure of a hospitals status to anyone 
who asked he said 
under the new system a hospital will be either accredited 
conditionally accredited or nonaccredited bushelle said with 
conditionally accredited replacing tentatively 
nonaccredited 
the head of a 12000member medical consumers group labeled the 
proposed changes a teeny teeny step thats all 
arthur levin director of the new yorkbased center for medical 
consumers said in a telephone interview friday that providing 
information on request is not the same as making inspection results 
public 
most people will not be aware of and perhaps not capable of 
figuring out who do i call and how do i get the information 
levin said if you know enough to make your way to the joint 
commission theyll answer your question but its not a great leap 
forward 
thomas morford director of health standards and quality for the 
federal health care financing administration which oversees 
accreditation and certification of hospitals said the changes 
would be a rational place to begin 
questions about whether the joint commission is making adequate 
inspections have intensified since the wall street journal in 
november 1988 revealed shoddy conditions in accredited hospitals 
morford said 
morford said his agency has recently increased the number of its 
validation inspections or government inspections to compare 
with joint commission findings 
the proposed rule changes also call for routinely giving 
morfords agency full information on inspections at hospitals that 
slip to a conditionally accredited rating such information now 
is provided only at the agencys request 
the agency cannot disclose such inspection information to the 
public under current law but a move is afoot on capitol hill to have 
the law changed bushelle said 
people have a right to know said bill vaughan an aide to 
rep fortney h stark dcalif who is looking into the matter 
the medicare budget is 109 billion he said in a telephone 
interview friday from washington payments to hospitals are 65 
percent of that 
the board of the joint commission is to consider changing 
accreditation rules feb 12 to consider changing disclosure rules 
april 29 bushelle said 
the board is made up of representatives of the american college 
of physicians the american college of surgeons the american dental 
association the american hospital association the american medical 
association and the public

chief justice william h rehnquist and 
associate justice sandra day oconnor of the supreme court sported 
headgear friday that added a touch of history to president bushs 
inauguration 
rehnquist and oconnor wore black skullcaps that are part of a 
british tradition for judges dating back to the early 16th century 
according to historians 
the skullcaps seldom worn in this era have been part of the 
justices official dress in the past

justice charles evan hughes wearing one at the inauguration of 
president franklin d roosevelt in 1941

the real transition on this inaugural day took 
place in the white house between 1105 am and noon seventy 
pictures of ronald and nancy reagan bit the dust seventy pictures 
of george and barbara bush and their bushel of kin took their place 
the cue for this hurried redecorating was the departure of the 
motorcade carrying the reagans and bushes to the capitol for the 
swearingin ceremony 
we made sure he had left the complex first said frank posey 
the white house frame maker we have a lot of respect for him 
everywhere in the white house were signs of the new replacing the 
old from the press office came the bush administrations first 
official announcement advising the news media what mrs bush was 
going to wear for the inaugural balls 
that gown if tradition holds will end in the first ladies 
exhibit at the smithsonian institution but the new first ladys 
press office decreed that its description be held secret until 8 
pm the first instance of news management in the fledgling 
administration 
as bush recited the oath of office interior department workmen 
in green uniforms were carrying what appeared to be office furniture 
out the front door of the white house and placing it in an unmarked 
van 
no one would say where in the white house it was used the 
reagans personal furniture was shipped to their los angeles home in 
october 
in the cabinet room a painting of the declaration of 
independence replaced calvin coolidge over the mantelpiece the 
chairs of four holdover cabinet secretaries marked with metal 
plaques are joined by new ones that are unmarked until their owners 
are confirmed 
new in the oval office are six plates from the chinese dinner 
service that is part of the white house collection a desk set 
blotter letter holder of leather and gold and 20 family pictures 
also a bust of theodore roosevelt and a foothigh sculpture of a 
horse bushs prize for being the 1981 houstonian of the year 
selected by the houston school for the deaf 
bush requested only the picture of the declration of 
independence of everything else said fitzwater he may change it 
all tomorrow 
the new president wont see any of this until saturday when he 
visits his new office for the first time bush will find a familiar 
chair behind the desk wheeled down the hall from the vice 
presidents office 
a lonely group of press office holdovers watched the inaugural 
ceremonies on television monitors but soon the place began fillng 
up with bush staffers arriving to take on their new jobs occupying 
offices that until friday had belonged to the reagan team 
just one president going out one going in said b jay 
cooper who will stay on under press secretary marlin fitzwater 
another holdover 
the press office itself remained neutral on its walls are 
pictures of former presidents back to franklin roosevelt meeting 
with reporters 
they didnt change but other photographs did 
down came pictures of nancy reagan in red skirt and pink blouse

a commander of rebels operating around 
the afghan capital of kabul predicts afghanistans marxist 
government will collapse within weeks after the soviet troop 
withdrawal set to be completed next month 
abdul haq field leader of the main faction of guerrillas 
positioned around kabul said afghan soldiers dont want to die 
for the regime and the party people are on their way out of 
afghanistan 
he spoke in a recent interview in peshawar where a sevenparty 
alliance of afghan guerillas is headquartered 
western diplomats in pakistan say about 10000 members of 
afthanistans ruling peoples democratic party have fled the country 
since the soviets began their withdrawal last may 
by western estimates the party has about 55000 members but 
president najib and other party leaders have placed the membership 
at about 200000 
the soviets sent more than 100000 soldiers into afghanistan 
beginning in december 1979 to help the government battle the 
anticommunist rebels under a unmediated agreement signed last 
april the soviet union is to remove all of its military forces by 
feb 15 
haq 30 said the afghan marxists could be taken care of in 
five or 15 days after the soviet pullout 
he said most of the government troopers are undisciplined young 
men pressed into military service but he acknowledged that units 
such as the elite palace guard and the state security force are 
still in fighting shape 
they will be the last people to leave after the soviets haq 
said 
he claimed the rebels have infiltrated the army the palace guard 
and new communist commando units he said some ranking military 
officers have pledged their allegiance to the rebels but remained in 
the marxist fold to dismantle it from within once the soviets leave 
byt haq said he fears there will be chaos in kabul if rebel 
leaders are not ready with a political alternative to najibs 
government 
the guerrillas have announced plans to convene a shura or 
council consisting of 60 nominees from each of the seven rebel 
parties to select a transitional government 
moscow has said a broadbased council is a move in the right 
direction but that the organization should include representatives 
of the peoples democratic party 
haq said such a combination of anticommunist moslems and 
marxists would be a formula for continued fighting and not peace 
in iran a spokesman for afghan rebels based there complained 
that they had not been consulted about political moves being 
prepared by their colleagues in pakistan 
irans islamic republic news agency in a report monitored in 
cyprus quoted mohammad karim khalili of the iranbased afghan 
rebels as saying on staterun television the decision to create 
such a shura has been made without coordination with the coalition 
and independent afghan groups 
the afghan resistance is divided into two major groups the 
iranbased shiite moslem alliance and the larger sunni moslem 
coalition headquartered n pakistan 
the shiite alliance fearing it would lack strength in the shura 
wants a cabinet to be formed before agreeing on the council

a soviet icebreaker broke through a wall of ice and 
rescued researchers trapped on an ice floe drifting off greenland 
tass reported friday 
the icebreaker rossiya failed on its first attempt to reach the 
north pole 28 station from the south on thursday but swung around 
and smashed a channel to the men in distress from the north the 
official soviet news agency said 
the ships crew and the scientists are now evacuating the 
equipment of the polar station it said tass did not say how many 
scientists were at the station 
capt anatoly lamekhov of the rossiya reported rapidly rising 
winds and heavy snow had cut visibility to near zero 
the worsening weather also foiled scientists plans to trap the 
research ship otto schmidt in the ice floe and have it complete the 
research mission of north pole 28 tass said 
the ship was taken farther south to safer waters away from the 
rapidly shifting ice floe to await an escort from the icebreaker 
tass said 
the decision to evacuate north pole 28 was made after the ice 
floe on which it was placed was caught in a warm current north of 
greenland and began drifting southward and melting 
it could no longer hold a rescue plane so the rossiya was 
dispatched sunday from the arctic port of murmansk 
soviet media did not exactly what kind of research the scientists 
were conducting 
north pole 28 was set up in may 1986 north of the new siberian 
islands which lie in the sea of laptev north of the coast of 
central siberia 
slowly carried by the ice floe it drifted near the north pole 
and lay only 17 miles from the pole in the spring of 1988 tass 
said the station was then picked up by the east greenland current 
which rapidly brought it into the relatively warm waters of the 
north atlantic tass said

sandinistas celebrated the end of the 
reagan era with dancing in the streets meetings at factories and 
parades that mocked him and the local opposition 
people dressed up as former president reagan uncle sam and 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo a strong critic of the leftist 
sandinista government one float showed uncle sam throwing dollars 
and the opposition picking them up 
a huge plaza was cordoned off for dancing 
panamanians led by gen manuel antonio noriega also celebrated 
reagans departure shooting fireworks at noon and dancing to bands 
in a plaza on panama citys main thoroughfare 
in managua a headline in the progovernment nicaraguan daily el 
nuevo diario read hallelujah hallelujah reagans gone 
there is pride satisfaction on our part but not celebration 
of victory because the war has not ended and even if it ends the 
effects cannot disappear at cannot end from night to day bayardo 
arce vice coordinator of the ruling sandinista national liberation 
fronts political commission said in an interview with the fronts 
daily barricada 
he noted that rebels known as contras and armed by the united 
states remain in honduras and are capable of continuing to carry 
out military operations 
fighting in the 7yearold war has declined since the sandinistas 
and the rebels signed a tentative ceasefire agreement last march 
23 a month after the united states stopped military aid to the 
contras 
however talks on a permanent agreement have been stalled since 
september although most of the rebels are back in camps in 
honduras clashes continue particularly in southwestern nicaragua 
the government has said it hopes relations will improve under 
president bush 
as soon as bush was sworn in the government said it would 
immediately begin issuing visas for us diplomats 
nicaragua imposed visa restrictions after each country expelled 
eight of the others diplomats including the ambassadors last july 
arce said us analysts indicate that bush could present 
possibilities of political change 
but he said you have to be prudent which doesnt mean letting 
down your guard and continue working for peace and be prepared to 
the maximum for any eventuality 
el nuevo diario said the celebrations were organized by the 
fronts department of agitation and propaganda 
unlike the nicaraguans noriega chief of panamas defense forces 
and the countrys de facto leader said he expects nothing of bush 
he said he was celebrating reagans departure like any other 
panamanian nearby supporters burned effigies of reagan former 
panamanian president eric arturo delvalle and members of the 
panamanian opposition 
acting president manuel solis palma and other officials also 
attended the celebration 
the reagan administration still recognizes delvalle as president 
although he was ousted after trying to fire the general last 
february 
the united states has been trying to pressure noriega to resign 
since he was indicted in florida on us drug charges in february 
noriega denies the charges and is mentioned as a possible 
presidential candidate in may 7 elections 
the progovernment newspaper critica published a photo of reagan 
on the front page with the caption at last the genocidal ronald 
reagan leaves

president reagans departure from the 
government doesnt mean he will be without government benefits 
ranging from a lucrative pension to aroundtheclock secret service 
protection and an office suite in which to work 
reagan in fact will receive two pensions one from his eight 
years as president and another from his eight years as governor of 
california both the former president and mrs reagan also have 
plans to write books and make speeches for which they are expected 
to command handsome fees 
reagans california state pension is 29188 a year his federal 
pension currently is 99500 but would jump to 155000 if congress 
approves a salary increased reagan has recommended 
in addition the secret service will provide lifetime 
aroundtheclock protection and he will have at his disposal a 
penthouse office suite in california and a townhouse in washington 
the security applies to both mr reagan and mrs reagan but not 
to their children because they are adults however the protection 
does apply not only to the reagans new home in a fashionable los 
angeles suburb but also to their 688acre ranch north of santa 
barbara 
in addition the government will pay to ship reagans papers to 
california and process them at an estimated cost of up to 500000 
another 13 million has been set aside for providing storage for 
the papers 
each former president receives a office allowance of up to 
300000 reagan already has waiting for him a penthouse office 
suite in a los angeles office building the suite includes offices 
for reagan mrs reagan the ronald reagan presidential foundation 
the secret service and an aide 
the reagans personal wealth is difficult to measure from public 
documents reagans latest financial disclosure statement which 
discloses assets in only broad categories said only that their 
assets which are in a blind trust were valued at more than 
250000 
the reagans bought their ranch near santa barbara for 526000 in 
l974 and made 127000 in improvements eight years later it 
undoubtedly is valued at much more today their new home in los 
angeles was purchased by friends for 25 million the reagans are 
leasing it for a reported 15000 a month

platoon from each of the five branches of the military service 
reagan did not address the crowd 
with their dog rex the reagans boarded the plane that in the 
previous eight years would have been designated air force one a 
sign in the crowd read so long gipper 
about an hour earlier reagan stood by as george bush took the 
presidential oath of office at the capitol bush who fought reagan 
tirelessly for the republican presidential nomination in 1980 before 
becoming his vice president turned to reagan after taking the 
presidential oath and said president reagan on behalf of the 
american people i thank you for the wonderful things you have done 
for america 
reagan asked while he was walking with bush through the rotunda 
of the capitol if he felt a sense of relief said no but a great 
pride in whats happening 
following the solemn swearingin ceremonies and bushs acceptance 
speech bush and his wife barbara escorted the reagans to the east 
side of the capitol to a waiting helicopter where they said their 
goodbyes with handshakes and kisses 
as the reagans stood in the doorway of the marine helicopter 
reagan turned and snapped a salute to bush who returned it 
asked by a reporter for his final thoughts reagan said only 
carry on 
the bushes were joined by vice president dan quayle and his wife 
marilyn who waved goodbye to the reagans before their helicopter 
lifted off and made a final sweep of the mall and white house

the oval office to make sure according to his spokesman marlin

successor

often briefed reagan there on trouble spots throughout the globe 
told him the world is quiet today mr president

chilly overcast weather and mrs reagan wore her familiar red coat 
as hail to the chief was played for the last time of the reagan 
presidency 
reagan flew on an air force plane designated sam 27000 it was 
the same plane he had flown thousands of miles on as air force one 
when he was president but air force one is a radio code reserved 
for the plane on which the president flies and is not used when a 
sitting president is not on the plane 
from the los angeles airport the reagans were going by motorcade 
to the home in the fashionable belair neighborhood that they are 
renting from friends who bought it for 25 million the pool of 
reporters assigned to fly with him from washington however were 
not included in the motorcade as they are on presidential trips as

long favored such as the line item veto for presidents and repeal 
of the constitutional amendment limiting them to two terms

planned in a bankrupt hospital at lake view terrace 15 miles north 
of belair on the edge of the angeles national forest

leftist guerrillas attacked the 
downtown treasury police headquarters with mortar fire from the 
backs of two pickup trucks friday killing two people and wounding 
up to 10 authorities said 
the trucks exploded when the mortars were fired and the 
explosions caused more casualties than the shrapnelladen 
projectiles they reported 
the treasury police press office identified one victim as a 
guerrilla who fired a mortar that blew up before he could get away 
his charred body lay about nine feet from the smoldering 
wreckage his name was not immediately available 
also killed was hector guardado a wounded treasury policeman who 
died in a hospital the office said 
col heriberto hernandez commander of the treasury police said 
the vehicles exploded within minutes of each other at about 625 
am about 150 feet from the wall surrounding the base 
shortly after the attack the rebels clandestine radio farabundo 
marti said their mobile artillery caused extensive damage to 
the headquarters but reporters allowed into the compound saw no 
damage to installations and hernandez said no projectiles landed 
inside 
he said two soldiers were wounded by shrapnel one seriously he 
also stopped a military vehicle as it left the base carrying two 
badly burned men 
hernandez opened the vehicles door so journalists could 
photograph the two wounded men who sat trembling their clothes in 
tatters and wide patches of skin peeled off their chests backs and 
arms 
hernandez said the men were civilians 
four more wounded civilians were taken away earlier by red cross 
ambulances according to other civilians 
residents of the poor iberia neighborhood next to the base said a 
woman was wounded by what appeared to be shrapnel a man was also 
reported wounded in an exchange of gunfire between guerrillas and a 
treasury policeman 
a civilian employee of the treasury police told journalists the 
projectiles exploded in the air over the base a treasury police 
officer inside the compound confirmed that to the associated press 
neither would give his name 
apparently two projectiles exploded one from each truck 
the marxistled guerrillas launched similar attacks in november 
and december on national guard headquarters the countrys main air 
force base and headquarters of the joint chiefs of staff all in or 
just outside the capital 
ricardo perdomo president of the central elections council 
asked the farabundo marti national liberation front on friday to 
agree to a ceasefire so march 19 presidential elections can take 
place smoothly 
no immediate response came from the guerrillas who in the past 
increased activity during electoral events the rebels say free and 
fair elections are impossible in wartime and that elections here in 
this decade were designed to delude the citizenry into believing 
their government is democratic 
the insurgents contend el salvadors usbacked ycivilian 
administration is a facade for militarydominated government 
the rebels want to share power in a transition government and 
demand negotiations between the government and the farabundo marti 
to end the war 
an estimated 65000 people mostly civilians have been killed in 
the 9yearold civil war 
the treasury police force originally formed to prevent 
production and sale of homemade liquor has taken on predominantly 
military functions in the past 20 years and has a special 
antisubversive unit

prime minister margaret thatcher said friday that 
britain will attend a conference on human rights in moscow in 1991 
only if the soviet union releases all religious and political 
prisoners 
britain and the united states initially refused to attend the 
conference but after reforms initiated by soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev they said this month that they agreed in principle to go 
mrs thatcher listed the conditions in a written reply to a 
legislators question in the house of commons other conditions 
included 
implementation of promised changes in soviet criminal law with 
the abolition or amendment of political and religious articles 
effective guarantees of free speech freedom of religion 
freedom to emigrate and genuine independence of the courts 
a guarantee that the conference would be run on exactly similar 
lines to eastwest meetings held in the west 
maintenance of existing improvements 
all of this assumes that nothing has happened in the meantime 
to seriously undermine the greatly improved state of eastwest 
relations mrs thatcher added

the owner of a defunct frankfurt 
company under criminal investigation for allegedly helping libya 
build a suspected poison gas factory denied friday that the plant 
was designed for chemical weapons 
there arent any chemical weapons there ihsan barbouti who 
operated ibi engineering said in an interview with west 
germanys zdf television network 
i wish i could take two or three american experts to libya if 
they then still insist that it was designed to produce chemical 
weapons then i will take responsibility 
the united states contends the plant in rabta 60 miles south of 
tripoli the libyan capital is capable of producing poison gas 
libya says the plant produces pharmaceuticals 
the zdf interview was conducted in german and english at the 
iraqiborn barboutis london apartment 
barbouti said he knew the president of another west german 
company under investigation very well but could not say whether 
the company imhausenchemie had provided equipment for the plant 
he also denied that ibi was directly involved in building the 
plant 
my office in frankfurt only sent certain building materials to 
libya thats all libya built it he said we had nothing to do 
with the chemical part 
he said west german authorities had not contacted him about his 
role in the project but that he would be happy to talk to them 
the frankfurt prosecutors office last week launched a criminal 
investigation against the company and its records were seized 
barbouti said that as far as he knew the plant was designed to 
produce pharmaceuticals 
ibi is believed to have coordinated the construction of the 
plant by securing contracts with west german firms 
west german officials say they still have no evidence that export 
laws were broken 
the government has said it plans to toughen export laws to ensure 
that west german firms do not take part in the construction of 
plants that could produce chemical weapons

a muchmocked investment in art by the pension fund 
of britains state rail network is expected to make many millions 
this spring with the sale of 25 paintings and drawings by 
impressionist and modern masters 
the works by 14 artists such as paul cezanne pierreauguste 
renoir and claude monet were bought between 1974 and 1979 for about 
7 million 
they are expected to make up to 43 million in london april 4 
the auctioneers of sothebys handling the sale for the british 
rail pension fund are sending the pictures on tour to paris feb 
2122 new york feb 27march 1 los angeles march 36 and tokyo 
march 1015 
this is the first big collection of pictures we shall sell this 
year and the prices will indicate the state of the market for the 
worlds most popular paintings michel strauss the firms expert 
on the period said in an interview friday 
he said the top price could be 7 million to 9 million for 
renoirs la promenade a strawhatted man helping a woman in a 
white dress up a woodland path it cost 12 million in 1976 
a 1905 blueperiod work of pablo picasso young man in blue 
bought privately for an undisclosed sum could bring up to 7 
million 
there is also an 1888 ink drawing of cottages by vincent van 
gogh and portraits of cezanne by renoir and camille pissarro 
strauss said he recommended the pictures to the fund originally 
as good investments 
from the time the program began in 1974 to the time it stopped in 
1982 the fund was criticized by financial commentators for going 
outside its field of expertise and being advised by sothebys on 
buying 2700 works of art paintings antiquities furniture 
silver porcelain books and manuscripts for about 9 million 
that was 1 percent of the value of all its investments for 
british rail pensions at that time 
the fund exhibited many of the art works in museums it has sold 
1000 of them for 27 million 
strauss said the return on the funds art investments has been 
the same as for real estate higher than government bonds and lower 
than stocks 
strauss 52 who has spent 27 years at sothebys said 10 percent 
of the buyers of impressionists and modern artists in london and new 
york are american 25 percent are japanese and 65 percent are 
european or europebased 
whats different about this sale is that the pictures belong to 
a single institution and are stamped with one persons taste mine 
i chose them and i still love them strauss said

the last nicaraguan immigrants packed up their 
belongings and left the bobby maduro stadium on friday as the park 
was prepared for the arrival of the baltimore orioles baseball 
spring training camp 
the stadium in an industrial part of the inner city became a 
shelter for a growing influx of nicaraguans refugees entering texas 
called it their south florida destination possibly not realizing 
the orioles were due jan 25 
the central americans began arriving from southern texas by the 
busload last week following a federal judges ruling that the 
government could not keep them there while processing their 
applications for political asylum 
the nicaraguans maintain they are fleeing the oppression of the 
leftist sandinista government the immigration and naturalization 
service says the immigrants are ineligible for asylum if they 
actually are fleeing bad economic conditions in their homeland 
which has been hurt by a us trade embargo 
officials expect 100000 central americans to arrive here in the 
next year 
on friday the last of the nicaraguans were being moved to 
apartments rented for a month by the homeless project for the city 
of miami 
this is a lot like home for me said felix mendoza 21 of 
the stadium you know how much nicaraguans love baseball and they 
always used to go to the games at home after i get a job and some 
money id like to come back for a game 
mark coates assistant coordinator of the homeless project said 
about 55 nicaraguans stayed thursday night and would be gone by 
friday others had left in the last week 
as many as 150 homeless people but not the nicaraguan refugees 
will be allowed to remain at the stadium until jan 23 
its been an emotional time for them coates said of the 
nicaraguans theyve had to move two times and most of them just 
want to get their life going 
the refugees first months rent was paid with 30000 in private 
donations as well as 70000 collected in telethons by two spanish 
television stations said pablo canton miamis assistant community 
development director

beatrice lillie a blithe comedian in dozens of 
broadway and london shows died peacefully friday after a life of 
artistic triumph and private tragedy she was 94 
miss lillie lady peel after her marriage in 1920 to sir robert 
peel a descendant of a 19th century prime minister died at her 
home in henleyonthames 
she just went this morning peacefully said john phillip 
huck her associate for 40 years and since 1977 her guardian 
miss lillie suffered a stroke in 1975 and required constant care 
in her later years 
her perfomances were marvels of improvisation and she was a 
master of the eloquent putdown often delivered with a twirl of a 
long cigarette holder 
her art is as elusive and astonishing a reviewer once said 
as the contradictory elements in her appearance which include the 
trim sociable lady peel the improbable nose and determined chin of 
an elegant clown the sad cool eyes of a satirist and the little 
burnished head and shining scrubbed look of the choirboy who gets 
all the plum solos 
she was in the title of her 1973 autobiography every other 
inch a lady 
after working with noel coward in the broadway production of 
the year of grace in 1928 she declared we loathed each other 
with every quivering fiber of our beings 
they were in fact friends and mutual admirers but coward 
explained in life magazine in 1964 that her inspirations could be a 
torment 
she may stray widely from the written script she may 
interpolate words and phrases of her own which are far from the 
authors intentions and as often as not entirely irrelevant 
coward wrote but the instinctive accuracy of her touch and 
impeccable taste sweep the audience into transports of laughter 
if i suddenly did everything on cue i might throw the whole 
cast off she told associated press drama writer william glover 
during the run of high spirits her last broadway appearance in 
196465 
the musical was based on cowards blithe spirit and was 
directed by him 
coward remained part of her circle of friends which also 
included george bernard shaw and the young princess margaret to 
whom miss lilly taught her trick of swinging a long string of pearls 
around her neck like a hulahoop 
she was a tireless entertainer of troops during world war ii the 
conflict in which her only child robert was killed the telegram 
with the awful news that his ship had gone down arrived at an 
opening night in manchester england 
dont talk about it darlings miss lillie said in a note 
posted backstage now lets get on with it 
beatrice gladys lillie was born may 29 1894 in toronto she was 
exposed to music through the concert singing of her mother 
young beatrice was dismissed from her church choir at age 8 she 
recalled for making depressing faces at the congregation during 
hymns 
at 15 accompanied by her mother and sister an aspiring pianist 
she went to britain in hope of making a singing career 
her first appearance on a british stage came in 1914 and a 
decade later she made her broadway debut in a review produced by 
andre charlot 
before broadway however she married peel in 1920 had a son two 
years later and briefly retired from the stage her husband died in 
1934 
in 1932 miss lillie took a dramatic role as the nurse in the new 
york premiere of george bernard shaws too true to be good but 
then returned to working in reviews those included at home 
abroad in 1935 the show is on in 1936 and cowards set to 
music in 1939 
in 1939 she also appeared in london in all clear 
she returned to the new york stage in 1944 with seven lively 
arts and was in inside usa in 1948 
from 1952 to 1956 she toured the world in a onewoman act an 
evening with beatrice lillie which won a tony award in 1953 
in 1958 she starred in london in auntie mame 
her film credits including exit smiling in 1927 around the 
world in eighty days in 1956 and thoroughly modern millie in 
1967 
huck said a funeral service was tentatively planned for jan 30 
at st margarets church in harpsden near her home in oxfordshire

namibian elections possibly by encouraging antimarxist rebels in 
southern angola to cross the border into namibia

suggesting ways to cut the cost of the mission without endangering 
its success 
the un chiefs special representative for namibia martti

in the blink of an eye in a ceremony as old as 
the republic ronald reagan is transformed from mr president the 
most powerful man in the world to mr citizen 
he keeps the title as an honorific all the presidents do but 
the mantle of office falls away completely he becomes nothing 
exofficio he casts no votes he has no say and his counsel if 
it is sought at all is sought as a courtesy 
he becomes a member of a most exclusive club that of 
expresidents which will number more than three on inauguration day 
for the first time since 1861 the others are reagans immediate 
predecessors richard nixon jimmy carter and gerald ford 
ronald reagan has joked about what he will do immediately 
as soon as i get home to california he said i plan to 
lean back kick up my feet and take a long nap 
that wont be so different from other recent presidents 
harry truman took the train home to independence and said the 
first thing he did was to carry the luggage into the attic the next 
morning he was up at 730 having slept unusually late and walked 
into his front yard to get the paper 
my return to ordinary citizenship began a new life filled with 
new meaning he said afterward after all the crowds and furor 
the whole business did not seem so easy were the people going to 
let me become a private citizen or was i still going to have to 
live up to the title of mr president that the people insisted on 
using 
truman was blessed with living in less dangerous times at first 
his only added security was the fence that the secret service had 
put up around the house at 219 north delaware and a former highway 
patrolman who doubled as chauffeur and bodyguard he took his 
morning walks down to the town square often unnoticed if you wanted 
to talk to him you had to do it at 120 paces a minute but you 
could do it only in his later years were laws passed that beefed up 
his protection at government expense 
dwight d eisenhower who hated top hats had dictated the 
wearing of homburgs at his own inauguration john f kennedy aware 
of that mischievously ruled that top hats be worn at his 
swearingin and eisenhower as the outgoing president was forced to 
comply 
no wonder he told reporters as he was driven out of washington 
that it was wonderful to shed the burdens of the presidency he and 
mamie were driven in a fourcar convoy to their farm in gettysburg 
pa the next day he attended a dinner thrown in his honor by the 
townsfolk and a couple of days later he was in albany ga shooting 
quail 
the latter was in the tradition set by theodore roosevelt who 
went on an african safari after leaving the jungles of washington 
ford didnt bother to go home he stayed long enough to hear 
jimmy carters inaugural address got his helicopter pilot to make 
one last swing over the white house and the capitol flew to 
california and before the day was out was hitting golf balls off a 
practice tee 
the next day he was arnold palmers partner in the bing crosby 
proam tournament at pebble beach ford told reporters he thought he 
had prepared himself well for the swift switch in power we 
certainly took the attitude that our time had ended and president 
carters time had begun ford said 
but he wiped away a tear or two at the airport saying i dont 
deny i got a little sentimental but i tried not to expose it to 
keep it within myself 
carters leavetaking and nixons for different reasons were 
the most traumatic 
carter had stayed up all night handling final details of a 
complicated deal worked out with iran to gain freedom for 52 
american hostages who had been held hostage for 444 days he 
catnapped on the oval office couch and left for the reagan 
swearingin only at the last minute 
en route to the capitol carter got word the iranians had agreed 
but the first planeload did not take off from tehran until five 
minutes into the reagan presidency 
the 39th president flew to georgia in air force one and to plains 
in a helicopter at 430 am the next day he boarded the same 
aircraft for germany to greet the returning hostages carter flew 
back home after a few hours on the ground 
nixon too had a fitful last night in the white house on aug 
8 1974 he had told the nation that because the watergate scandal 
had eroded his political muscle i shall resign the presidency 
effective at noon tomorrow 
afterward his family consoled him and nixon went to bed with the 
sound of protesters outside chanting what his daughter described as 
their sick message in the morning he had corned beef hash and 
poached eggs alone in the lincoln sitting room signed a message of 
resignation addressed to the secretary of state and said a tearful 
goodbye to his administration 
this was the nightmare end of a long dream he wrote later 
i had come so far from the little house in yorba linda calif to 
this great house in washington 
he too flew back home on air force one to years of 
selfimposed exile before he ventured forth again 
there was no talk there were no tears left nixon said of 
seeing the white house retreating in the distance he leaned his 
head back against the seat and closed his eyes then heard his wife 
saying to no one in particular its so sad its so sad 
lyndon b johnson flew to texas immediately after he left office 
on jan 20 1969 landing in austin before a crowd estimated at 
approximately 10000 and then going on to the lbj ranch in johnson 
city 
in retirement johnson worked on his library at the university of 
texas in austin and writing his memoirs until his death on jan 22 
1973

the government on friday began refusing to 
allow foreigners to adopt ecuadorean children after police uncovered 
a ring that allegedly kidnapped babies and sold them overseas 
deputy secretary of social welfare elsa maria castro said 
adoptions by foreign parents were being halted pending a review of 
ecuadorean adoption practices 
the decision was announced after police this week arrested a 
quito lawyer and four women in connection with irregularities 
surrounding the adoption of 30 ecuadorean children since early 1988 
the children who ranged in age from one month to three years 
were adopted by parents in great britain and norway police said 
police allege that a babytrafficking ring would kidnap children 
in quitos bustling openair markets and falsify identity papers 
certifying the children as orphans 
the children were then adopted by foreign parents via the 
ministry of social welfare which is in charge of ecuadorean 
adoptions they said 
the adoption process in ecuador involves prospective parents 
retaining a lawyer to serve as an intermediary with the government 
castro did not say when adoptions would be resumed 
police identified the reputed ring leader of the baby ring as 
attorney jorge moncayo the four women were not named 
moncayo in an interview published friday in the quito newspaper 
hoy denied any wrongdoing and was quoted as saying that he has been 
arranging legal adoptions for several years 
his lawyer jorge andrade charged that women who brought 
children to moncayo had previously falsified their papers without 
moncayos knowledge

george herbert walker bush was inaugurated the 
41st president of the united states on friday urging upon his 
countrymen fresh faith that even in a peaceful prosperous america 
we can make it better 
then handinhand with his wife barbara the new president rode 
and for a time walked at the head of his own parade home in 
splendid sunshine to the splendid misery of the white house an 
estimated 300000 people exchanged his joyous waves along the way 
in an inaugural speech long on inspiration and short on 
initiatives bush offered a symbolic hand of bipartisanship to the 
opposition democrats and asked the nation to put aside materialism 
we are not the sums of our possesions he said 
a new breeze is blowing and a nation refreshed by freedom 
stands ready to push on there is new ground to be broken and new 
action to be taken bush declared 
in slight chill at three minutes past noon bush took the oath of 
office preserving the conservative custody of the white house 
claimed eight years earlier by ronald reagan after saluting bush 
from the steps of his helicopter reagan flew off with his beloved 
nancy to retirement in california like his recent predecessors the 
departing president took a final airborne pass over the white house 
reagan aboard the presidential jetliner told reporters his 
departure was a time of tears for a great many people and 
certainly for us it was hard to say goodbye but california 
isnt a place in my mind its a way of life so thats the sweet 
part of the bittersweet experience 
reagan became the first president since another republican 
dwight d eisenhower who held office from 1953 to 1961 to serve 
two full terms and the first president in 60 years to turn the white 
house over to a successor of his own party 
my friends we have work to do bush said in his 20minute 
speech we have more will than wallet but will is what we need 
he asked americans to help him steer the nation on a course of 
high moral principle to battle the domestic scourges of 
homelessness drug addiction and crime and tyranny and terrorism 
abroad 
republican bush told democratic congressional leaders that his 
would be the age of the offered hand to the world he said the 
hand could be a reluctant fist strong and could be used 
with great effect 
with his oath bush 64 the fourth oldest man to be sworn in as 
president crowned a heroic odyssey of government service personal 
setback and triumph it took him from privileged home of an eastern 
financier and senator to aerial combat in the pacific from sweaty 
work and heady gambles in the texas oil fields to diplomacy in 
china from political defeat to presidential landslide 
moments before bush took the rostrum on the capitols west 
portico dan quayle the 41yearold former senator from indiana 
was sworn in as the new vice president by supreme court justice 
sandra day oconnor 
with the heralding of trumpets bush was introduced one last time 
as the vice president of the united states he paused for a word 
with his 87yearold mother dorothy and then shook hands with 
reagan 
then as an estimated 200000 people looked on from the capitol 
grounds bush in navy pinstriped business suit placed his left 
hand upon two bibles one used by george washington one by his own 
family and recited his oath 
i george herbert walker bush do solemnly swear that i will 
fiathfully execute the office of president of the united states and 
will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the 
constitution of the united states 
like all his predecessors he added so help me god 
he began his address with a tribute to the departing reagan 
who has earned a lasting place in our heaerts and in our history 
but reagan left behind some major challenges for the new 
president particularly the massive national debt 26 trillion 
and spending and trade deficits running 150 billion each per year 
bush barely touched upon those issues 
we have a deficit to bring down he acknowledgedwe will 
make the hard choices looking at what we have and perhaps 
allocating it differently making our decisions based on honest need 
and prudent safety 
and then we will do the wisest thing of all we will turn to 
the only resource we have that in times of need always grows the 
goodness and courage of the american people 
for this is the thing bush said this is the age of the 
offered hand 
bush said republicans and democrats have often been too 
mistrustful an attitude he traced back to the vietnam war the 
final lesson of vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to 
be sundered by a memory he said 
with that bush symbolically extended his hand to the speaker of 
the house jim wright of texas and to the majority leader of the 
senate george mitchell of maine 
wright returned the gesture mitchell sat passively later the 
leaders met with bush and watched as he signed papers formally 
nominating his cabinet 
former house speaker thomas p tip oneill who had many 
memorable battles with reagan declared were back to normalcy in 
the white house how delighted i am 
in boston a subdued michael dukakis watched on television 
eating a tuna sandwich the vanquished democratic presidential 
nominee credited bush with a good speech and sent him a 
congratulatory telegram for the sense of optimism the call to 
duty and the generosity of spirit by which you called on all of us 
bush drew his greatest applause when he spoke of the drug issue 
saying we as a society must rise up united and express our 
intolerance there is much to be done and to be said but take my 
word this scourge will stop 
bush started with a prayer one imploring the divinity to write 
on our hearts these words use power to help people 
i come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich 
with promise we live in in a peaceful prosperous time but we can 
make it better he said 
afterward while bush lunched with members of congress the skies 
cleared and the temperature climbed into the 50s to present bush 
with a pictureperfect afternoon for his parade a 3hour affair 
that stretched past sundown 
the celebration continued into the night as the bushes and the 
quayles made the rounds of nearly a dozen inaugural balls throughout 
the capital 
bush who is not keen on dancing made it through the first 
couple of events without taking to the dance floor 
this is the first formal event and perhaps the most humane 
a ball at which you do not have to dance the president said at 
his first stop of the evening 
quayle too showed little interest in dancing but said i guess 
protocol allows you to witness my inability to dance as he and 
mrs quayle took their turn around the floor

bushs brief parade forays from the security of the new 
presidential limousine once at the foot of capitol hill and again 
upon his arrival at the white house recalled a similar gesture by 
jimmy carter in 1976 when the democrat walked most of the route 
for bush it seemed to symbolize his inaugural promise to usher in 
an age of the offered hand 
at the white house the bushes took their seats in an enclosed 
reviewing stand to watch more than 200 marching units including 
those from schools and colleges in every state pay their salute 
his adopted texas produced an especially large contingent and son 
george bush jr donned a white 10gallon hat as the university of 
texas longhorn band strutted by 
the parade with famed test pilot chuck yeager and comedian bob 
hope as grand marshals featured 12000 marchers 457 horses and 70 
floats including one with a navy tbm avenger torpedo bomber a 
duplicate of the plane bush flew in world war ii bush waved in 
delight as it passed by he and mrs bush stood and sang along for 
the finale a rendition of battle hymn of the republic by the 
morman tabernacle choir 
on saturday they planned to personally open the white house doors 
for a public reception 
in his first official acts as president bush signed a 
proclamation making sunday a national day of prayer and 
thanksgiving and formally presented congress with his nominations 
for his seniormost aides 
the ceremony took place in the ornate presidents room where 
lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation and former president 
lyndon johnson signed the 1964 civil rights act 
the inaugural platform was framed against a backdrop of red 
white and blue featuring american flags from 1789 1889 and 1989 
the archway that bush walked through was draped in red bunting like 
that hung on federal hall in new york city when george washington 
was inaugurated two centuries ago 
bush took his oath administred by chief justice william 
rehnquist three minutes behind schedule he removed his topcoat and 
donned his glasses to read his speech turning the pages of his text 
as he went despite having a teleprompter 
after bidding farewell to reagan the bushes and quayles joined 
the two justices and congressional leaders for a traditional 
luncheon in the capitols statuary hall before leading a massive 
parade down pennsylvania to the white house one featuring marching 
units and other performers from every state more than 10000 people 
participated and hundreds of thousands lined the parade route 
at andrews reagan reviewed a platoon from each of the five 
military branches then received a 21gun salute as an army band 
played the national anthem the reagan waved to a flagwaving crowd 
of about 2000 people before boarding the boeing 707 jetliner which 
would no longer be designated air force one with him aboard one 
person waved a sign so long gipper 
earlier reagan was asked as he was walking through the rotunda 
of the capitol if he felt a sense of relief he replied no but a 
great pride in whats happening 
bush meanwhile was asked how he intended to carry out the goals 
cited in his inaugural address without a tax increase 
you never measure kindness and gentleness in how much you take 
out of the pockets of the people bush said 
sen j bennett johnston dla said bushs appeal for 
bipartisanship was very well received by democrats 
in the final hours of his presidency reagan paid a farewell 
visit to the oval office shook hands with aides and left a 
handwritten note on the desk wishing bush well the last piece of 
paper reagan signed was a letter to british prime minister margaret 
thatcher thanking her for staunch support over the years said 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
serving as white house hosts one last time the reagans treated 
the bushes and the quayles to coffee and pastries in the blue room 
of the executive mansion then they went to the capitol together 
thousands of people surged into the city to view the festivities 
and get an spot along the 16mile inaugural parade route although 
federal employees were given the day off there was a heavy crush of 
passengers on the subway system catching ciy officials by surprise 
in advance bush said that in the first days of his 
administration he would order a sweeping review of us relations 
with the soviet union while making the federal budget deficit his 
top priority at home he will meet tuesday with leaders from 
congress 
in a handwritten note bush scripted his day up at 6 am to 
watch news shows and drink coffee play with grandkids pray go

a neurosurgeon told a medical board on 
friday that he drilled holes in the skulls of two young women and 
injected saltwater into their brains to cure their drug addiction 
the athens medical society ordered dr dimitris vougiouklakis to 
appear before a disciplinary board and recommended that his license 
be revoked vougiouklakis also could face criminal charges 
the 69yearold physician told the medical society during a 
hearing friday that he performed the chemical lobotomies to cure 
the women of heroin addiction 
vougiouklakis 69 has been quoted in newspaper inteviews as 
saying that because we had exhausted other forms of therapy it was 
my thought to perform lobotomies on them 
a lobotomy is a surgical operation in which incisions are made in 
a lobe of the brain it has been used to treat some cases of 
psychoses such as schizophrenia 
the present condition of the two unidentified women ages 23 and 
26 was not disclosed 
the medical society said after the hearing friday that 
scientific and ethical procedures were ignored and the operation 
itself does not constitute therapy it asked its disciplinary 
council to revoke the doctors license 
greek medical ethics call for doctors to explain procedures and 
risks to the patients before giving therapy 
if vougiouklakis license to practice is revoked the public 
prosecutor will automatically step in to press charges of 
malpractice under greek law 
matina letsa a spokeswoman for the health ministry said a 
medical investigator has been assigned to look into the matter 
the bizarre case shocked the athens medical community and made 
the front pages of the national press after it was reported in the 
afternoon daily ta nea last week 
ive never heard of a chemical lobotomy i know surgical 
lobotomies were performed in extreme cases of mental illness in the 
1950s but the method was abondoned because it was destructive to 
the personality of the patients said fotis bobos a psychiatrist 
at the center for mental health 
i have certainly never heard of a lobotomy on drug addicts 
he added 
a leading athens psychiatrist who requested anonymity said the 
operation was much ado about nothing 
the saline solution will just dissolve and there will be no 
result whatsoever but tampering with someones brain can be 
destructive the psychiatrist said

traders at the nations biggest futures exchanges 
are putting their seats up for sale panicked by an investigation in 
which fbi agents reportedly posed as traders and bought a seat on an 
exchange 
five more seats were sold by the close of business friday for a 
total of 14 seats sold at the chicago mercantile exchange and the 
chicago board of trade since thursday when news broke on the probe 
into allegations that traders defrauded investors of millions of 
dollars 
we had a weeks worth of sales in a day said andrew yemma 
chief spokesman for the merc 
traders at the two exchanges are the targets of an investigation 
that involved the taperecording of hundreds of transactions on 
trading floors over a twoyear period subpoenas have been issued 
for records at both the merc and cbot 
the chicago tribune reported friday that the fbi secretly paid 
for a board of trade seat which can cost hundreds of thousands of 
dollars and had agent richard carlson act as a soybean futures 
trader he was one of four agents who picked up evidence of 
widespread fraud 
commodities attorney john troelstrup attributed the sales of 
seats to fear of the unknown among traders 
its the sudden realization they have been in the midst of 
people who are not of them wearing wires said troelstrup but he 
said most would not be greatly affected by the investigation 
there are people who will be more careful he said but the 
overwhelming majority of the traders on the floor will do nothing 
differently because they didnt do anything wrong 
fbi spokeswoman jane koshutko would neither confirm nor deny the 
investigation friday but a law enforcement official in washington 
who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed it a day earlier 
seats on the exchanges allow traders access to various markets on 
the trading floor the merc has 2724 seats the board of trade 
3400 
last year the price of a merc seat ranged from 350000 to 
523500 officials said prices for board of trade seats ranged 
from 371000 to 545000 said mark prout an exchange spokesman 
the tribune citing sources it did not identify said carlson and 
another agent michael mcloughlin who traded treasury bonds 
attempted to win the confidence of other traders by entertaining 
them at posh downtown apartments and exercising with them at an 
expensive health club 
the agentsturnedtraders recorded conversations on the trading 
floors that suggest some trades were rigged to prevent customers 
from getting fairmarket prices and that some brokers sent false 
reports to customers to hide the skimming of profits or overcharges 
on commissions the tribune said 
unlike stock brokers on wall street commodity traders trade for 
themselves as well as their customers in a chaotic auction system 
that employs shouting and hand signals making it easy for a trader 
to get lost in the crowd 
they buy and sell contracts for future delivery of commodities 
such as grains livestock treasury bonds and foreign currencies 
carlson and mcloughlin first showed up at the board of trade in 
1983 as trainees at adm investors inc a commoditytraining arm of 
archerdanielsmidland co traders told the tribune 
richard burket an adm vice president in decatur ill confirmed 
that the two worked at adm investors but he declined to comment 
further 
fbi agents accompanied by carlson and mcloughlin visited 
suprised traders and commodities executives at their homes tuesday 
to deliver the first grand jury subpoenas resulting from the 
investigation sources told the tribune 
this is a dramatic thing but it may not be traumatic in the 
big picture troelstrup said friday most traders are just going 
to go about their business 
the traders trust of other traders will proceed in the classic 
manner theyll go based on their guts and instinct

dan quayle took office as the nations 44th 
vice president on friday completing his move from campaign 
lightning rod to understudy for the presidency 
at 41 quayle assumed the second highest office in the land one 
which has been largely ceremonial in nature over history and for 
which the new president has spelled out no real duties 
quayle preceded president bush in taking the oath of office by 
six minutes at 1157 am est and wore his topcoat against the 
chilly breeze 
supreme court justice sandra day oconnor administered the oath 
but she failed to include six wellknown words after the pledge to 
defend the constitution she omitted the phrase against all 
enemies foreign and domestic 
quayle smiled broadly but said nothing beyond the words of the 
simple oath of office oconnor concluded with congratulations 
later quayle told reporters i was listening very carefully as 
she administered the oath and i was very careful to repeat precisely 
as she offered it to me 
asked if he was aware some words were left out he said im 
not going to get into that 
during the oath quayle said he was thinking that you cant 
help but think the entire world is focusing upon you 
the new vice president was sworn in with his wife marilyn at his 
side and holding a family bible on which her husband rested his 
hand their three children tucker 14 benjamin 12 and corinne 
9 looked on from behind them 
marilyn quayle a lawyer and seriousminded adviser to her 
husband during the campaign wore a brilliant blue oversized 
sailors hat after the ceremony the hat blew off her head in the 
backwash of former president reagans departing helicopter 
they rode in a limousine through the inaugural parade from the 
capitol to the white house stepping out of their car to walk 
briefly and wave to the crowd mrs quayles hat was back on her 
head a secret service agent had retrieved it 
mrs quayles dress and hat were the work of fashion students at 
the fashion institute of design and merchandising in los angeles 
they also designed the hat and dress worn by corinne said quayle 
press secretary david beckwith 
quayle and his wife were making the rounds of all of the evening 
inaugural balls 
quayle planned to deliver his first speech as vice president 
saturday beckwith said it would be a personal view of the 
campaign his philosophy and thoughts on the future 
formerly the littleknown junior senator from indiana quayle was 
propeled to the nations secondhighest job by his surprise 
selection to the ticket by bush last august in new orleans at the 
republican national convention 
quayle has described what followed as a baptism by fire he 
was dogged by questions about his experience qualifications 
military service and academic record he became the focus of intense 
criticism of bush for his judgment in the selection by bushs 
democratic opponent michael dukakis 
receiving the warm greetings of supporters at a reception the day 
before taking office quayle recalled the harshness of the campaign 
criticism by quoting winston churchill 
winston churchill once said that theres nothing more 
exhilarating than to be shot at without result quayle said 
in the traditional oath quayle promised to support and defend 
the constitution of the united states and to bear true faith and 
allegiance to the same 
before the capitol ceremony quayle and his wife were invited to 
the white house by outgoing president reagan for morning coffee with 
bush and his wife barbara 
they attended morning services with bush and mrs bush at st 
johns church near the white house 
quayle and his family arrived on the terrace outside the capitol 
for the inaugural ceremony four minutes after the reagans arrived 
quayle chatted with the departing president for several minutes as 
they awaited bush 
as quayle stood preparing for the oath bush turned to the quayle 
children smiled and asked are we ready 
quayle kept his coat on through the presidents address as the 
wind and dropping temperatures in the shaded terrace made conditions 
cooler than the mild weather forecast portable space heaters were 
placed around the rostrum quayle took off the coat to join the 
bushes in waving to the crowd 
later in the evening quayle and his wife made the rounds of 
inaugural balls she wore a long purple gown with a fitted 
embroidered top and a purple bow in her hair 
before setting out for the evening quayle told reporters my 
wife tells me im a terrible dancer and im going to try to keep it 
to a minimum 
at each of the balls he spoke briefly to the crowds danced with 
his wife and then he and marilyn danced with guests selected form 
the audience 
i guess protocol allows that you witness my inability to dance 
but im going to be much better after the night is over he said

this was an exciting fashion week in rome not so 
much for the beautiful clothes seen on the runway as for the verbal 
fireworks set off by valentinos lastminute decision to take his 
new springsummer high fashion collection to paris 
calling his rome show traditionally the high point of the twice 
a year italian high fashion week a preview the king of 
italian couture announced that for the first time he would present 
his collection during the parisian shows which open next week 
the blow of italys favorite fashion son abandoning the home 
runway would have been bad enough but during a news conference 
valentinos business partner giancarlo giametti defended the 
decision by saying that valentino could no longer afford to show for 
down and out women and secondrate actresses 
he mentioned no names and romes in crowd were faithfully in 
their front row seats when the curtain rose on the new collection at 
romes fashionable grand hotel thursday night 
rumor has it however that in the interim valentino made a 
hurried round of flattering phone calls to those clients who could 
have taken giamettis remarks personally 
valentino who already shows his readytowear collection in 
paris has repeatedly said he has no intention of abandoning rome 
but is just adding paris to his highfashion runway as proof he 
cites the massive restoration work going on in his downtown rome 
palazzo which will include enlarged offices and a brand new theater 
however italian fashion watchers see the paris show as a severe 
blow to the madeinitaly label except for a golden period in the 
1960s italian high fashion has been the poor sister of paris 
couture valentino was the ace up its sleeve and the mainstay of 
the rome fashion week 
aside from valentino the roman fashion favorite remains roberto 
capucci who on friday closed the rome fashion week during which 
italys top 15 high fashion designers showed their new wears 
in general the look for the springsummer 1989 presented in rome 
this week was romantic and feminine daytime and cocktail hour 
hemlines remained an inch or two above the knee unlike the 
readytowear lengths for this years warmer season which fell 
dramatically below the knee after the latest mini skirt craze 
shoulders are demure and for the most part unpadded waistlines 
tend to be marked although trousers are not rampant they do appear 
in almost every collection 
colors are either contrasts of black and white or navy and white 
beiges and grays or bright shades of blue green yellow red and 
tangerine 
with less shimmery and sequined fabrics as in past seasons 
jewelry tends to be opulent with gold dripping from the neck or 
draped around both wrists in the shoe department there are lots of 
sling backs with heels going higher as the day goes on 
lacey fabrics are the big item for day and night 
what paris will see next week and rome saw thursday is a 
valentino who wants his woman so dainty and prim that she risks 
resembling a nanny or a tea room waitress stiff and proper white 
collars pop out of impeccable navy blue suits with or without brass 
buttons for the cocktail hour these suits come in black and white 
with bib or apron like lace accessories 
at night valentino abandons the boredom of perfection and comes 
back to his sensuous roman senses with wonderful velvet jackets 
embroidered in sequined elephants manufactured in india and ball 
gowns made of flounces of ruffled taffeta and satin bows 
gianfranco ferre a top name in milan readytowear but a 
relative newcomer to high fashion literally weaves his gowns out of 
raffia and wicker interspersed with silk spring flowers he also 
takes the mantilla off the head and wraps it delicately over the 
shouldlers the unique and easily identifiable effect is sure to 
make ferre a big name at international garden parties this summer 
capucci never does what everyone else is doing but his own thing 
always excels his clothes look as good on the rack as they do on 
the model meaning they are first works of art and then items of 
attire not for nothing do capucci creations show up in fashion 
museums throughout the world 
the look capucci proposes is a more modern slimmeddown version 
of his opulent corrugated silk gowns with the everpresent huge 
panels and generous bustles he favors bright carnival shades as 
well as lifesized silk flowers to dot gowns and jackets his latest 
invention is the cape coat or dress where the side seams are 
stitched together

territory for seven centuries has sought to reduce tensions in the 
area by showing greater tolerance for tibetan religious and cultural 
practices and elevating some tibetans to positions of local 
authority

two ultralight aircraft collided during a night 
flight 500 feet above the florida panhandle killing one pilot while 
the other escaped with facial cuts authorities said thursday 
brian lewis 29 of holt was dead at the scene of the crash 
wednesday night about a mile southwest of this panhandle community 
dennis allen young 35 also of holt was treated for facial cuts 
and discharged from a hospital 
they met every weekend to fly but when they arrived at the 
site late wednesday they decided to go ahead and fly at night since 
there was a full moon said bill welch an okaloosa county 
sheriffs spokesman 
young told investigators the two had never flown at night before 
but both aircraft were equipped with strobe lights to help them 
navigate and avoid each other 
young said he tried to avoid a collision but lewis craft struck 
the bottom of youngs ultralight and went into a nosedive 
young was apparently able to glide down after the collision 
but the other fellow fell from a great distance said nick stager 
director of okaloosa county emergency medical services 
ultralights are small lightweight singleengine aircraft 
resembling hanggliders more than traditional fixedwing planes and 
often are built from kits the national transporation and safety 
board said it will not investigate because ultralight aircraft below 
a certain weight are not subject to federal aviation regulations

progovernment newspapers suggested 
that the political opposition staged the looting of a red cross 
warehouse to discredit the austere economic policies of the ruling 
sandinista party 
the official party newspaper barricada asked wednesday if the 
looting was the work of criminal elements or if it was calculated 
with political intentions 
the progovernment el nuevo diario went a step farther in a 
wednesday editorial it suggested the cia and the opposition 
newspaper la prensa had invented the story it said they wanted to 
discredit the leftist government 
managua red cross director omar cruz said scores of people who 
broke in through the warehouse roof tuesday took clothing and food 
donated for victims of a hurricane that lashed the atlantic coast in 
october 
cruz told the associated press which photographed the incident 
that he did not know what the stolen items were worth 
la prensa said the intruders were nicaraguans made desperate by 
the severe economic crisis 
were hungry we have no clothing the sandinistas are at fault 
for all of this it quoted a looter as saying tuesday 
nicaragua suffered more than 20000 percent inflation last year 
the government has devalued the currency several times and raised 
fuel and tranport prices in attempt to right the battered economy 
the leftist government says hurricane joan worsened an economic 
crisis brought on by eight years of civil war with the 
ussupported contra rebels 
hurricane joan slammed into the country on oct 21 1988 killing 
about 100 people and leaving estimated 200000 homeless property

protestors angry that ancient human remains were 
dug up to make way for a luxury hotel have halted a maui island 
resorts construction and given new life to the fight between 
developers hoping to lure more tourists here and hawaiian activists 
trying to preserve the islands culture 
although this land was once ruled by hawaiians they are no 
longer part of the power elite i dont think this could happen to 
the gravesite of a more powerful group said hawaiian activist 
edward kanahele a spokesman for the group malama na kapuna or 
caring for our ancestors its been painful for us to see so many 
other burial sites paved over or dug up but we were never organized 
enough before now we are 
it was hundreds of protestors like kanahele with the sympathy of 
parthawaiian gov john waihee who forced a temporary halt dec 23 
to the excavation of the secondlargest known hawaiian burial site 
in this island chain 
by then more than 900 skeletons had been exhumed most believed 
to have been buried more than 1000 years ago 
but the state cannot force kapalua land company inc to give up 
its plan to build the nearly 100 million 450room ritz carlton 
hotel on mauis northwest shore 
kapalua has the countyissued construction permits it needs and 
halted the excavation only as long as it takes to work out a 
compromise 
kanahele said it was up to hawaii residents concerned with its 
history and culture to stop the desecration of burial sites and 
removal of our culture 
as recently as 20 years ago when bones were regularly found at 
construction sites they were often burned thrown away or just left 
at the site that treatment was considered desecration according to 
ancient hawaiian tradition a persons mana or spirit lived on 
with his remains 
we mainly have to look at the morality and religious aspects of 
this issue kanahele said those bones have been buried there 
for thousands of years they are our history and our culture we 
should not be swayed by the brief economic interlude provided by a 
hotel that surely wont last as long as those remains 
kapalua land is a subsidiary of maui land and pineapple co and 
the latters chairman colin cameron said the presence of the 
burial ground was known before the site was chosen he said he 
worked closely with maui county and the office of hawaiian affairs 
a state agency that represents native hawaiian interests before the 
construction permits were granted 
oha knew all along that it was a large and possibly very 
significant site and they agreed to the excavation said paul 
rosendahl an archelogist hired to excavate the grounds he reported 
weekly to oha and a maui hawaiian group after the dig began 
but linda delaney the ohas land and natural resources officer 
said the sites significance has only recently become clear the 
history of the site wasnt well documented and people just didnt 
realize how many people were buried there she said now that we 
know were trying to stop it 
earlier this month oha passed a resolution calling for a 
permanent halt to the excavation reburial of the remains 
consultation with local hawaiian activist groups and the designation 
of the 23acre burial site as culturally sensitive and 
offlimits to development 
when asked where that leaves the development company which has 
already poured 3 million into the project delaney said i dont 
know what happens to the hotel those are the kinds of questions 
that need to be worked out we have to appeal to the community 
conscience the developers conscience 
kapalua land agreed to rebury the bones about a mile from the 
hotel site with the excavation 85 percent complete its too late 
to preserve the original burial site cameron said 
he said he was surprised by opposition to the dig excavation 
began in august of 1987 and there were no protests at the site 
until late last month 
meanwhile the remains are being stored at the kapalua site said 
rosendahl who would like to analyze the skeletons its such a 
complete population he said we could learn so much about the 
ancient hawaiian culture from this dig 
kanahele though said the activists dont want the bones dusted 
off 
their afterlife has already been affected he said theyve 
gone through enough

for the first time since 1978 
south africans have reason to wonder how their countrys many 
challenges might be tackled without the dominating presence of pw 
botha at the helm of the government 
although the stroke suffered by the president wednesday has been 
described as mild there is widespread speculation that he will be 
sidelined for several weeks and may have to retire on thursday 
botha appointed constitutional development minister chris heunis to 
serve indefinitely as acting president 
botha has amassed vast powers in recent years and his illness 
raises the possibility that important political developments in the 
coming months will have to be handled by subordinates accustomed to 
deferring to the president 
president botha has come to assume in our public life such a 
gigantic stature that his illness casts great uncertainty over the 
nation said business day a johannesburg newspaper in an 
editorial thursday issues of profound importance await his 
attention 
for example namibia ruled by south africa since 1915 is due 
to begin a sevenmonth transition to independence on april 1 botha 
has overseen the negotiations which produced this agreement and is 
believed to have helped resolve differences within his cabinet 
the status of nelson mandela remains in limbo the african 
national congress leader has been transferred from a jail cell to a 
spacious house on a prison farm but botha appears to be seeking 
some conciliatory statement from mandela before freeing him it is 
possible though by no means certain that a new president might 
find it easier to approve mandelas unconditional release 
on feb 3 at the opening of parliament botha was expected to 
announce an early general election to be held in late april 
political analysts said the stroke would prompt bothas national 
party to postpone an election until botha recovers fully or until a 
replacement can establish himself 
it would be extremely difficult for the country to go to the 
elections with a sick state president in charge and it would be 
difficult for a new incumbent to go to the polls until he is bedded 
down in his new office said colin eglin chairman of the liberal 
progressive federal party 
under south africas constitution the majority party in the 
white chamber of parliament has total control over the election of a 
president the national party is widely favored to retain its solid 
majority whenever the next elections are held and thus bothas 
eventual successor is almost certain to come from a group of senior 
cabinet members dedicated to the partys current policies 
in simplest terms those policies call for gradual reforms that 
will ease but not eliminate segregation and that will extend some 
political power to blacks while leaving the white minority in 
control 
the star newspaper of johannesburg the countrys largest daily 
on thursday quoted national party officials as saying national 
education minister fw de klerk is the leading contender to succeed 
botha his political views are considered close to bothas and he 
is party leader in transvaal the most populous province 
foreign minister pik botha who is no relation to the president 
also is a contender he is more flamboyant and slightly more liberal 
than most of his cabinet colleagues but his support from the public 
is believed to be stronger than within the national party caucus 
which will choose the new president 
the most hawkish contender is defense minister magnus malan he 
is viewed as capable of halting defections to the far right but 
unlikely to achieve breakthroughs in relations with the 
disenfranchised black majority 
heunis a longtime botha ally is not viewed as a leading 
contender to become the next fullfledged president 
mangosuthu buthelezi a relatively moderate black leader whom 
botha has tried unsuccessfully to draw into negotiations said 
thursday the president has served south africa as he best knew 
how and nobody should begrudge him the rest which should follow the 
stroke 
botha has done more than all his predecessors to turn south 
africa in the right direction said buthelezi but the zulu leader 
indicated he would be glad to see bothas transitional era end 
because reform has ground to a halt

a few days after beijings first exhibition of 
nude paintings opened in december art students put up posters 
critizing it then nude models went on strike 
now two models have sued the institute that sponsored the show 
and some artists around beijing are turning up their noses at the 
commercialism of the biggest nude exhibition in communist chinas 
40year history 
nevertheless ge pengren a motorcycleriding artist who 
organized the show remains undaunted 
were making money said ge an assistant professor at the 
central academy of fine arts and that for artists in china is a 
rare thing i dont care about the rest 
the show he added is giving new hope to the financially 
strapped art world in china and will serve as a model for 
exhibitions to come 
the 128 paintings of the exhibition of figure oil painting took 
up the second floor of the cavernous china art gallery from dec 22 
to jan 8 more than 200000 people lined up for hours in the cold 
to pay about 10 times the normal entrance fee of 020 yuan 5 cents 
inside they saw realist nudes abstract nudes expressionist 
nudes and impressionist nudes 
for us this was not just an exhibition of nudes ge said in 
an interview in his cramped studio in central beijing it was a 
movement a nude cultural movement a sexual culture movement 
in a commercial twist the show also spawned a series of spinoff 
items a coffeetable book on the exhibition postcards color 
slides a paperback 
sales have been brisk during the exhibitions 18 days viewers 
bought all of the shows 15000 books ge said more are being 
printed 
the exhibition differed from previous ones in china in that once 
it was approved by the ministry of culture a year ago government 
bureaucrats didnt interfere artists organized the show picked the 
paintings and put up capital 
we emptied our pockets to put the show on said ge all of 
us took major financial risks but its paying off 
indeed the show and the spinoff items are making so much money 
that ge wont disclose any figures after the state and the gallery 
take their shares the artists will keep the rest 
government officials appeared pleased with the exhibition a slew 
of editorials in the staterun press have sung its praises 
ge says an exhibition in february of young painters and a show in 
june of abstract art at the china art gallery will follow the nude 
shows format 
as part of chinas economic reforms the government is giving 
cultural institutions less money making them more dependent on 
outside sources of income 
were following that line said ge the result is we are 
freer and possibly richer if they dont hold purse strings our 
creativity is increased 
but for ge the ride has not been a smooth one 
two models sued the academy on jan 9 claiming they were not told 
the paintings would be shown to the public and the exhibition 
damaged their reputations show organizers earlier had removed five 
paintings of the two women 
their lawyers are asking for unspecified sums in damages 
one model said she had been thrown out of her house and her 
husband has asked for a divorce because her family saw her picture 
at the exhibition 
society considers me worse than a prostitute because ive done 
in the open what those women do in the dark said the other model 
i cant even go to the public baths because other women point at 
me and laugh 
the weekend after the show opened art students at ges academy 
protested the high cost of tickets 
i think its dangerous to turn art into a commodity said one 
artist at the institute i think thats what this show tried to do 
and that is what we were protesting

when nancy reagan told old pal merv griffin of 
her postwhite house dream to open a drug rehabilitation center 
bearing her name every mover and shaker for miles around was 
called to action 
rollsroyces bearing such luminaries as texas oilman marvin 
davis media magnate rupert murdoch and actress eva gabor poured 
into griffins beverly hills estate last may for a power breakfast 
at his tennis pavilion 
but the selfdescribed little people of lake view terrace 
fearing the center proposed for the bankrupt lake view terrace 
medical center would invite crime just said no sparking a battle 
described as david versus goliath 
im not fighting nancy reagan im not fighting ronald or what 
they stand for or what they do i just dont think this is the place 
for it said suzan kent 28 who lives across the street from the 
medical center 
mrs kent and others picketed a welcomehome gala for the reagans 
earlier this month with signs reading if you really care put it 
in belair referring to the reagans new neighborhood 
lake view terrace about 15 miles north of belair is a small 
town on the edge of a big city 
it sits at the foot of the angeles national forest one of the 
last semirural havens for folks who prefer goats grazing next door 
to ferraris cruising sunset boulevard 
when two planes collided over nearby pacoima junior high school 
in 1957 an accident depicted in the movie la bamba there was 
no place to take the dying the residents rallied to build the 
medical center 
so it holds a very special place in the hearts of the people 
said lewis snow an officer in the lake view terrace shome owners 
asociation 
snow and others want another hospital not a drug center they 
fear the centers residents will target nearby homes when they need 
extra cash 
on the other side of the debate is phoenix house the nations 
largest private nonprofit drug abuse agency founded in 1967 it 
operates 10 centers six in new york and four in california and 
is accustomed to opposition 
if we had to back down every time a community said not here 
wed never treat the drug problem in this country said spokesman 
christopher policano 
when mrs reagan decided to put her imprimatur on a center in the 
los angeles area she asked griffin to help reportedly saying i 
want to come back and go right to work 
griffin responded by inviting what he described as every mover 
and shaker in this part of the world to his may 2 breakfast 
about 4 million has been raised toward the estimated 10 million 
cost including 1 million at the 25000atable welcome home party 
thrown by barron hilton and griffin 
the 15acre site would offer treatment for 150 teenagers who 
would live and attend school at the center plus an additional 60 
young adults over 18 there would be outpatient counseling for 15 
to 30 youngsters who have just become involved with drugs and mrs 
reagan would have an office at the center 
the center would not accept anyone with a history of violence nor 
anyone on drugs when they were admitted the agency boasts a 90 
percent success rate among the 40000 or so graduates of its program 
the los angeles police department has remained neutral but area 
capt tim mcbride is willing to give phoenix house a chance 
we have a serious drug problem all across the country and 
weve got to do something about that problem the information i have 
about phoenix house is that theyre successful and theyre well 
run he said 
the center might open this year but roadblocks remain 
residents plan to pack a hearing before a city zoning officer on 
friday on tuesday the city council will consider a request for an 
environmental impact report that could mean an eightmonth setback 
for the center 
some residents believe the center will find a home elsewhere 
we definitely have a davidversusgoliath fight said 
resident jules bagneris and david did win

tuberculosis is on the rise in prisons 
paralleling the aids epidemic and will inevitably spill into the 
nations communities researchers reported today 
unless effective action is taken to intervene the tb problem 
in correctional facilities is likely to worsen during the next 
decade said researchers at the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
tb has made a comeback recently by attacking people whose immune 
systems have been damaged by aids health officials say 
we must not be so naive as to think that this problem will 
impact only on the prison system tb can have an impact on the 
communities into which inmates are released as well said dr 
dixie e snider jr and mary d hutton of the cdc 
their remarks appear in an editorial in todays journal of the 
american medical association along with a study that found 
tuberculosis rates have increased in new york prisons as the aids 
epidemic has emerged 
the authors of the study suggest the trend may be the same in 
other parts of the country 
tb struck fewer than one in 4000 inmates annually from 1976 
through 1979 in new york state prisons but the rate more than 
quadrupled to one in 948 inmates by the end of 1986 the study said 
the study found that 56 percent of new york inmates with tb in 
1985 and 1986 also were infected with hiv the virus that causes 
aids 
the studys authors who called for prompt screening and 
treatment said the increase of tb in new york prisons occurred 
primarily among men ages 30 to 49 in minority groups having a 
history of previous drug use 
they also are prime targets for aids an incurable and fatal 
disease that cripples the bodys immune system and leaves people 
susceptible to lifethreatening infections 
a similar connection with hiv has been observed with the increase 
in tb cases in other parts of the country the authors said 
it has been suggested that hiv infection may be at least 
partially responsible for this changing pattern said the authors 
led by dr m miles braun formerly of the new york state department 
of health and now of the cdc 
only a few years ago health officials hoped that tb which is 
fully curable with longterm antibiotic treatment could be 
eradicated entirely from the country by the end of the century 
the rate of new cases of tb had fallen about 5 percent a year 
from 1953 to 1984 but in 1985 as aids was on the rise the annual 
number of tuberculosis cases in the united states decreased only 02 
percent and in 1986 the tb rate actually went up 02 percent to 
22768 new cases according to the cdc 
tb caused 1807 us deaths in 1982 according to the national 
center for health statistics which could not immediately provide 
more recent figures 
it is of crucial importance that tb control measures be 
reinforced in the prison setting to counter the increased risk 
created by human immunodeficiency virus infection the studys 
authors said 
the study recommended prompt identification of inmates with tb 
along with isolation and treatment 
only 66 percent of state health departments routinely screen 
prison inmates for tb and only 12 percent periodically screen them 
again said the editorial writers 
a total of 1964 aids cases had been reported in us prisons by 
october 1987 according to a clerk at the us bureau of justice 
statistics in washington

for the first time since the chilling collapse of 
october 1987 the stock market is showing signs of heating up 
in thursdays trading the rally in prices that began slowly nine 
weeks ago and intensified after new years closed in on a milestone 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 036 points to close 
at 223911 less than eight points shy of its closing level of 
224674 on oct 16 1987 
that meant the market was on the verge of recouping the entire 
508 points it lost on black monday oct 19 of that year 
this rally is no flash in the pan proclaimed william 
lefevre an analyst at advest inc in his latest market commentary 
given a rise in the dow above 2247 he said a whole new crop 
of converts from bear to bull will enter the marketplace with buy 
orders 
not everyone on wall street is ready to go that far just yet but 
most concede that stocks are emerging from the long shadow cast by 
the crash 
brokerage offices around the country report a smattering of phone 
calls from investors who shunned stocks all through 1988 
professional money managers confess to worrying lately not about 
another bloodbath but about missing out on a possible rise in the 
market 
in the chartconscious world of investing many eyes have long 
been focused on the gap between the lowest prices on oct 16 1987 
and the highest ones recorded on the 19th 
when that gap was filled in this month as the market rose 
many saw it as a sign of a wound being healed 
the improvement in the financial mood does not appear to have 
been inspired by any dramatic shift in the economic news 
in fact the backdrop has been largely negative interest rates 
rising the trade deficit widening and worries persisting about a 
revival of inflation 
to some analysts however that makes the rally all the more 
impressive if the largerthanexpected trade deficit reported by 
the government on wednesday had been announced six months or a year 
ago they say it would have knocked the market for a loop 
instead it barely created a ripple and the dow finished the day 
up 2411 points 
to some observers the rally is not a happy development but quite 
possibly a trap the optimists though think investors have at last 
begun to recognize the impressive performance of the economy since 
black monday 
norman fosback editor of the investment advisory letter market 
logic maintains that a good year is in store for both the economy 
and the market 
while the stock market could experience a moderatesized 
correction along the way most years get at least one the major 
trend is up fosback says as for a crash well forget it

at least one in five american men has had one 
or more homosexual experiences and at least 33 percent have such 
sexual contacts regularly a national research council study says 
published today in the magazine science the study suggests that 
the number of american men who have had at least one homosexual 
experience is lower than the estimates compiled some 40 years ago by 
famed sex researcher alfred kinsey 
but charles f turner an nrc scientist and coauthor of the new 
study said the current estimates are the lowest possible numbers 
he said there are still not enough data to establish a true number 
which would in all likelihood would be higher 
all of the estimates that we have made are lowerbound 
estimates turner said thursday in a telephone interview these 
numbers are best treated as a minimum were not saying what the 
true number is but only that this is the best that can be done in 
terms of setting a lower bound

differences in the brain structure of male

quickly but females are less fooled by changes in landmarks a 
researcher says 
it doesnt suggest that males or females are better at solving 
spatial tasks psychologist christina williams of barnard college 
of columbia university in new york city said thursday it merely 
means they go about it in different ways 
williams and warren h meck another columbia researcher also 
found that brain structure can be altered in a way that seems to 
improve memory by giving rats choline a b vitamin rich in foods 
common in traditional japanese diets 
williams speaking at the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science said she believed there 
were similarities between rats brains and human brains but said 
she could draw no conclusions about human behavior from the maze

its victorian splendor faded this 
pacific port wistfully waits for its ship to come in again 
meanwhile a lingering charm attracts sunbathing tourists and 
sailors byzantine cobblestone alleys wind around its soaring hills 
plied by antique cable cars and painted wooden fishing boats bob 
among the huge cargo ships in the sparkling blue bay 
but many of its 290000 inhabitants openly pine for the days when 
valparaiso as a bustling center of commerce and culture lived up 
to its name valley of paradise 
it has a strong personality always has said francisco 
velasco 67 unfortunately its decaying its going downhill 
its dying 
everything has moved to santiago the capital city 70 miles 
inland he said the big industries the intellectual centers the 
artistic centers all to santiago here theres nothing 
velasco a retired physician turned writer spoke in an interview 
at his hillside home a rambling sixstory structure he shared with 
friend pablo neruda the nobel prizewinning poet until nerudas 
death in 1973 
forty years ago neruda called valparaiso the mountainous 
capital of the great ocean with slopes that glitter with the red 
and blue paint of toyshops 
now the paint is peeling on the hillsides covered with 
precarious zincroofed shanties mansions built by affluent traders 
and ship captains totter in disrepair abandoned or chopped up into 
tenements the 17 cable cars are run down their tracks rusty 
it isnt like it used to be said carlos brito a 76yearold 
cable car operator on a hill called alegre happy several of the 
citys 42 hills carry whimsical names like delights butterfly 
milkmen or pleasures 
brito recalled that decades ago the city was lovely the most 
beautiful there were places to go out and dance at night 
now he rarely goes out after dark explaining the boys catch 
you and give you hugs and kisses he meant the young thieves mug 
you 
like most residents mayor alejandro navarrete attributes the 
citys decline to the building of the panama canal in the early 
1900s 
before the canal valparaiso was a port of call for many ships 
steaming between the pacific and atlantic oceans around cape horn on 
the tip of south america the city was very very important the 
47yearold navarrete said there were always 100 or 200 ships in 
the bay 
local shipping and some industry kept the city going for decades 
but in the early 1980s when a severe recession struck chile 
several big factories closed or moved to santiago 
unemployment soared to more than 20 percent it has since 
declined to a stillpainful 12 percent 
even so valparaisos docks have never handled so much cargo 
thanks in large part to chiles booming fruit exports last year a 
record three million tons of goods passed through the port 11 
percent more than in 1987 it included 70 million crates of exported 
grapes peaches apples and other fruit up 20 percent from the 
previous year 
in part because of that activity navarette believes valparaisos 
luck is turning 
his hopes for a real resurgence are pinned on president augusto 
pinochets plan to move chiles congress to valparaiso congress 
which has been suspended since pinochet the rightwing army 
commander seized power in a bloody 1973 coup is scheduled to 
reopen in 1990 
a new 41 millioncongress building is going up at a valparaiso 
intersection so are surrounding property values 
navarrete confidently predicts that once congress is installed 
it will approve a project that has been the dream of the city 
fathers for decades a train linking valparaiso with santiago 
with the new technology it could easily go 250 or 300 
kilometers 150 or 185 miles an hour he said you could get 
from santiago to valparaiso in 50 minutes tops 
navarretes optimism clashes however with that of 
valparaisoborn sergio spoerer a sociologist who now lives in 
santiago but comes back regularly 
we are prisoners of nostalgia he said 
we tend to see our future in terms of rescuing some lost 
innocence and that keeps us from working together toward a real 
future

when johnny clegg and his 
multiracial band savuka sing about nelson mandela to an 
africanbased rock beat thousands of white hands sway above blond 
heads in a dimly lit auditorium 
the pounding rhythm the haunting melody the lyrics about 
imprisoned black leader mandela and the cheering clapping 
teenagers present an emotional scene but most in the audience 
dont understand the chorus which is sung in the zulu language or 
the meaning of the songs title asimbonanga you are far away 
from us 
yet clegg a 35yearold white who has spent 22 years trying to 
fuse african music with western traditions believes he is making a 
difference in south african history simply by giving white youths a 
good feeling when they sing about a black revolutionary 
theyre singing about nelson mandela man people are looking 
around nervously saying wow this is heavy its an experience 
for them said clegg the most successful rock star in south 
africa in a postconcert interview 
if i can just allow an alternative idea or image to occupy 
someones brain for two hours which has never been allowed in 
because of their church or their political views or emotional views 
but to slot it in because of a beat a vibe a feeling an emotion 
in the crowd ive done my job the next day when they read about 
mandela or some detainees its not so far away so abstract 
as a teenager clegg became interested in the zulu guitar music 
played by his familys gardener he was arrested at 16 for sneaking 
into a government hostel for migrant black workers where he learned 
to play the guitar dance and speak zulu 
cleggs first band jaluka was formed in partnership with a 
friend from the hostel but the africanbased folk music and street 
guitar jive were not commercially successful 
jaluka was a romantic cultural journey clegg said savuka 
is a hardcore group dealing with dark experiences in this country 
put together in a hopeful way that is something i think the 
world and south africa are ready for i feel myself part of a 
progressive cultural stream which has started to trickle out 
although clegg is outspokenly antiapartheid and his sevenmember 
band has more blacks four than whites the british musicans union 
and antiapartheid movement continue to picket his concerts and ban 
him from live television performances in britain 
clegg says he is victimized by the same confusion that dogged 
american singer paul simon when he brought black south african 
artists to worldwide attention in his graceland tour and album 
some antiapartheid activists in europe oppose performances by 
anyone who also performs in south africa even if the artists are 
black south africans savuka was not included in the free 
mandela rock concert in london last june although clegg 
consistently calls for the african national congress leaders 
release from his sentence of life in prison 
clegg hopes his affiliation with the american musicians union 
will end the boycott on his next trip to britain 
he has been wildly popular in france where he is known as le 
zulu blanc the white zulu his third world child album is a 
millionseller he has been a curtainraiser for david bowie george 
michael and sting but on its own in foreign venues savukas 
biggest draw has been 2500 to 3000 at the wiltern theater in los 
angeles and the beacon in new york city 
he will return to los angeles at the end of march to record a new 
album 
savukas johannesburg homecoming concerts jan 1314 drew the 
largest audiences of his career four soldout performances of 5000 
to 6000 people each almost all of them white 
my constituency is a white constituency said clegg whose 
energetic zulu dancing elicits wild cheers from young white fans 
they will be the generation which has to deal with the 
transition and you cannot deal with transition emotionally or 
psychically if you dont have a cultural tradition or root that you 
can relate to im helping to give them an idea of where they could 
find one

a big toy leopard in a pink tutu sits near the desk 
of madame tussauds chief executive but it isnt made of the waxy 
stuff that attracts 25 million visitors a year 
michael herberts office mate is a fiberglass leftover from a 
childrens exhibit and a sign of the companys future for tussauds 
isnt just into wax anymore 
the company whose waxworks were brought from paris to london 186 
years ago by the enterprising madame has bought a medieval castle 
and a set of caves owns one theme park and plans to build another 
for 90 million at a stately home its also delving into nonwax 
disneystyle animated figures 
but tussauds hasnt forsaken its roots its wax statues pop up at 
new ventures and the original exhibition has been londons top 
feepaying tourist site for two years 
to a celebrity few accolades are greater than an invitation to 
pose for a tussaud effigy and to the public its a true sign of the 
passage of fame when a wax statue gets taken to the storeroom its 
chamber of horrors with its freshly guillotined heads and 
disemboweled jack the ripper victims have given generations of 
children sleepless nights 
madame tussauds is something we rather crudely say you would 
visit three times in your life as a child a parent and perhaps a 
grandparent says herbert a gentle man who clearly delights in 
the fun side to his business like his leopard 
wax exhibitions need a turnover of people he said in an 
interview noting that more than half of madame tussauds visitors 
come from abroad therefore its no use going to set up a wax 
exhibition in somewhere like cleveland ohio or even chicago 
marie tussaud an accomplished sculptress in paris inherited the 
waxworks from the uncle who trained her she had made deathmasks of 
guillotine victims including marie antoinette but finding 
postrevolutionary france too chaotic for business she moved to 
england in 1802 
a marketing whiz in her time she guaranteed new audiences for 
the waxworks by touring britain for 33 years before settling in 
london at age 74 here she displayed her last work a scowling 
selfportrait in spectacles and black bonnet which is among the 350 
figures presently on display in the permanent exhibit on the 
marylebone road 
after her death the exhibit grew somewhat fustydusty 
herbert said but tourism boosted revenue in the 1960s and it has 
flourished in recent years with steppedup marketing 
tussauds the company as opposed to madame tussauds the 
waxworks first expanded in 1970 with an exhibition in amsterdam 
which has been so successful that the company hopes to move to a 
bigger site 
it bought the wookey hole caves in western england a popular 
tourist spot in 1973 and was attempting to buy the chessington zoo 
now the chessington world of adventures in 1978 when its owner the 
pearson plc conglomerate struck back by buying tussauds 
soon after tussauds bought 13thcentury warwick castle for then 
27 million and has installed a startlingly lifelike exhibit 
recreating with wax figures a typical 19thcentury royal weekend 
tussauds planned amusement park at woburn abbey the 
18thcentury stately home of the duke of bedford would be 
impossible without pearsons backing says herbert who is a 
director of cedafair lp an ohiobased amusement company sees great 
potential in this sector in britain 
after all we are still a very small company with turnover of 
30 million pounds 55 million he said to do this alone would 
really be sticking your neck out 
expansions aside tussaud vows never to abandon wax but the old 
standbys which cost an average of 18000 apiece are being 
improved and paired with newfangled figures 
next year tussauds will open a london exhibition of both wax and 
nonwax animated figures representing rock stars 
rock circus continues the disneystyle animation work begun 
with an exhibition near windsor castle on the outskirts of london 
called royalty and empire which recreates a scene from queen 
victorias diamond jubilee celebrations in 1897 
static wax figures are something weve been famous for more 
than 180 years says spokeswoman juliet simpkins what were 
doing with animation is enhancing the illusion 
also she said the mother exhibition on marylebone road uses 
more audiovisual aids with its figures but plain old wax still 
holds its fascination 
are you sleeping a small girl recently asked a young wax 
prince frozen in time will you wake up

conservation specialists in egypt worked for 
more than two years to save a 1600yearold book of psalms one of 
the countrys most important historic finds of recent years 
but nasry iskander chemist and chief conservator of the egyptian 
antiquities organization wasnt sure at first if he would succeed 
the book was in very bad condition when it was found in november 
1984 saturated with water and salt and around 490 parchment pages 
were stuck together in a heap between wooden covers 
today iskander proudly says the book which scholars say is the 
worlds oldest complete book of psalms is in remarkable condition 
for a relic of its age 
wed never seen such a book before in egypt i was wild about 
it he said we struggled to find a way to separate the 
parchment pages one by one without damaging anything not a single 
page could be harmed 
he said conservation work is much more difficult on parchment 
than on papyrus the two materials commonly used by early egyptian 
writers i touched everything as a blind person as though i were 
dealing in the dark because we knew nothing iskander said 
his first break came when he unbound two ninepage sections from 
their leather holders giving him a manageable number of pages to 
determine a method for separating the others 
by trial and error in raising and lowering humidity using tissue 
and waxed paper between sheets iskander separated then flattened 
some of the pages others followed some pried with nonmetallic 
utensils such as levers made of ivory or lemon wood some of the 
parchment pages were stuck with salt accumulated from readers 
fingertips 
coptic scholar gawdat gabra director of cairos coptic museum 
said he wasnt very excited when antiquities officials telephoned 
him to say that a book written in the ancient coptic language had 
just been discovered in a cemetery 85 miles south of cairo 
but the next day when i saw the book i knew instantly how 
important it was gabra said only every 50 or 100 years does 
something like this come to light if ever its among the top 
coptic finds of the second half of the 20th century 
antiquities inspectors excavating the graveyard found the book 
beneath the head of a 12yearold girl 
we had here a complete book with covers and it came from a 
grave excavated by antiquities inspectors gabra said for the 
first time we had everything together other manuscripts are 
incomplete 
he said the lack of expert documentation makes the origins of 
such other early biblical manuscripts as the sinai codex and the 
mississippi codex historically unclear and questionable because they 
surfaced through individuals or dealers 
a number of important biblical finds have been discovered in 
egypt where many jews sought sanctuary from various invasions of 
palestine and judea the greekspeaking jews of alexandria inherited 
hebrew scriptures that later were preserved partly through the 
efforts of early christian churches 
alexandrias greek bible became the official bible of christian 
communities in egypt and throughout the greekspeaking world in 
egypt whose coptic church traditionally was founded by st mark in 
ad 79 scriptures were translated into native dialects to meet the 
demands of peasant communities that did not speak greek 
the major biblical find of the 20th century was the discovery of 
the dead sea scrolls four decades ago in what is now israel they 
are leather and papyrus fragments of many of the books of the old 
testament and other prechristian era documents their early origins 
and texts changed biblical history

cia agents as depicted in the new public 
television series secret intelligence could remind you of 
wealthy inlaws you might curse their existence but they can come 
in handy in tough times 
debuting tonight on most public broadcasting service stations 
the fourpart secret intelligence series chronicles the 
fourdecade growth of american espionage outfits this critical 
history concludes that us intelligence agencies have come to be 
omnipotent giants both protecting democracy and at times 
undermining it 
in most matters of espionage the normal rules of combat do not 
apply series host bill kurtis says in his narration the only 
rule is win that philosophy not surprisingly can lead to 
tangles 
specifically to save us from communism secret intelligence 
says j edgar hoovers fbi borrowed techniques mastered by the 
soviet secret police to encourage his brand of leadership in 
nicaragua lt col oliver north allegedly lied to the us congress 
and secretly diverted money to the contras 
using these and other case studies secret intelligence aims 
to illustrate the fundamental clash between an open honest 
government and the increasingly forceful role covert intelligence 
plays in arms control fighting terrorism and maintaining world 
peace 
but whos a terrorist who defines world peace who is there to 
protect us from americas secret warriors who will watch the 
watchers these are just some of the questions secret 
intelligence attempts to answer 
it is more difficult to run secret operations in a society in 
which the congress supervises whats going on former cia director 
william colby says in the program but thats the cost of having 
the kind of constitutional government we have and in my view its 
well worth it 
while clearly not a new dilemma the issue grows more timely with 
the presidential inauguration of a former cia director george bush 
and the impending start of norths trial scheduled for jan 31 
secret intelligence unfolds in weekly chapters with each of 
the four segments addressing a specific intelligence concern the 
show alternates between intelligence victories the achievements of 
code breakers is especially prominent and espionage shortcomings 
the first episode the only rule is win looks at the origins 
of the fbi and the cia focusing on the collapse of intelligence 
analysis before the bombing of pearl harbor and in contrast the 
winatallcosts tactics used by us governmenttrained operatives 
in burma 
intervention the second installment examines the worldwide 
emergence of the cia as a secret army after world war ii the hour 
documents the cias orchestration of coups in iran and guatemala 
part three learning to say no inspects the scandals and 
failed efforts the bay of pigs assassination attempts the 
counterinsurgency program in vietnam that plagued intelligence 
operations in the 1960s and 70s 
the final episode the enterprise traces the roots of the 
irancontra armsforhostages scandal and fbi harassment of us 
citizens who opposed the reagan administrations foreign policy 
all of the shows feature interviews with intelligence experts 
former operatives journalists and six past cia directors including 
colby richard helms and the late william casey seen in his last 
television interview 
our intention here is not to do an expose series executive 
producer blaine baggett said at a recent news conference about the 
show we dont have the time the resources or the money 
baggett acknowledged that the series made at a cost of 12 
million was difficult to assemble visually the whole dilemma of 
doing this series he said is that you dont have file footage 
that the cia is going to turn over to you to illustrate its covert 
acts 
host kurtis said the series will deliver a broad contextual 
understanding of how and why us intelligence agencies operate 
it is the kind of program that the three networks no longer do 
said kurtis a cbs veteran the networks have closed up the large 
documentary units kurtis said pbs is the only place you will 
see this 
if the series leaves viewers with a lasting impression it is 
that even in an era of more attentive congressional oversight 
covert intelligence operations will continue 
can we run secret operations colby asked at the news 
conference the answer is yes

mistrust and acrimony are evident on all 
sides as namibias political factions maneuver for early advantage 
in the election campaign that will bring independence later this 
year 
the southwest african peoples organization which began a 
guerrilla war against south african rule in 1966 claims south 
africa is training a rebel army to overthrow swapo if it wins in the 
balloting nov 1 
swapos political opponents hope to win a significant share of 
power and suggest that the guerrilla movement might return to 
insurgency rather than join a coalition government 
both camps fear their rivals will try to intimidate voters and 
there is widespread doubt about the effectiveness of a united 
nations force of up to 7500 men due to arrive april 1 to monitor 
the election south africa worries that the un force will be 
biased in swapos favor 
my only hope is that we make sure the electoral process is so 
peaceful that the result will be accepted by winner and loser so we 
dont have a lebanon here said moses katjiuongua a black who 
serves in the territorial cabinet and plans to campaign against 
swapo 
we need a mechanism for addressing grievances so we dont get 
to a point where swapo decides to resume the armed struggle if it 
loses the election 
for swapo the political battle is to gain twothirds of the 
vote un resolution 435 which outlines the independence process 
specifies that the assembly elected to draft a new constitution for 
namibia also known as southwest africa can act only with support 
of twothirds of the delegates 
swapo officials allege that south africa is bringing angolans and 
other nonnamibians into northern districts with the intention of 
registering them as voters swapo also contends that south african 
security forces are visiting villages on antiswapo propaganda 
missions 
south african military headquarters has denied all accusations 
that its forces will interfere with the election 
although all but 1500 of south africas troops are to be 
withdrawn before the formal start of the election campaign june 25 
swapo officials are concerned that the territorial police force 
might play an intimidating role 
south africa has agreed to reduce the strength of the police 
force from 8300 to 7100 but the smaller force will include most 
members of koevoet a mainly black counterinsurgency unit which is 
being disbanded anton lubowksi a lawyer who is one of swapos few 
white members has charged that koevoet personnel are programmed 
killers 
jerry ekandjo swapos chief spokesman in windhoek said swapo 
if it took power would conduct a rehabilitation program for former 
security force members and other namibians who have been misled by 
the enemy 
but swapo supporters will not take the law into their own 
hands he said 
katjiuongua the cabinet member denounced the proposed 
rehabilitation program and said a violent reaction was probable if a 
swapo government pursued a policy of punish the puppets and 
traitors but he denied allegations that south africa had asked 
him to form a rebel army in the event of a swapo victory 
the factions opposing swapo ranging from rightwing whites to 
former swapo officials are engaged in negotiations on possible 
alliances as many as three coalitions as well as a few individual 
parties could compete against the guerrilla movement for support 
among namibias 13 million people 
we are not against the creation of new political parties but 
were concerned that they are being funded by south africa with the 
sole objective of denying swapo a twothirds majority swapo 
official hage geingob told a recent conference in zambia he said 
some of these groups might become the terrorists of tomorrow 
spokesman ekandjo like some other swapo officials refused to 
even discuss the possibility that his movement would get less than 
twothirds of the vote 
weve been fighting all these years to win he said 
but nathaniel mahuilili acting president of swapo in namibia 
said if we lose were not going back to war 
swapo would participate in a coalition he said and work to 
ensure outright victory whenever elections next took place

carlos saul menem a peronist and 
leading candidate for president drives race cars flies planes 
smiles easily wears his hair to his shoulders and likes to be 
photographed with showgirls 
the 53yearold provincial governor is colorful in a way that 
intrigues an electorate weary of the burdens of argentinas foreign 
debt energy crisis tripledigit inflation rising unemployment 
and political and social tensions 
union members and the poor are the core of menems peronist party 
constituency they ignore his gaffes and policy gaps and remember 
his promises of a brighter tomorrow his visits to their factory or 
village the naturalness with which he slips a gaucho poncho over 
his head and sips mate tea and the five years he spent in prison 
during the 197683 military dictatorship 
its easy for me to communicate with people menem said in an 
interview at his campaign office i talk with everyone i feel at 
home in the most humble places 
menems main rival in the elections set for may 14 is eduardo 
angeloz of the governing radical civic union 
the peronist has been the frontrunner since his upset nomination 
last july though his lead narrowed from 37 percent to 30 in a 
recent nationwide survey by the agency mora y araujo noguero and 
associates 
two other candidates trail by wide margins in that and virtually 
every other poll the number of undecideds remained high at 19 
percent 
menem and angeloz once classmates at the national university of 
cordoba law school in the 1950s are as different as the 
sidebyside provinces they govern 
angelozs cordoba is a rich populous industrial hub of 25 
million 
he prides himself on being a good administrator and supports the 
policies of the president raul alfonsin including privatizing 
argentinas costly public services paying off the foreign debt and 
basing economic growth on increased exports 
menems la rioja is a poor sparsely populated province of 
200000 where high technology is needed to coax seedless grapes and 
jojoba whose oils are used in hair preparations from desert sand 
and heat as many people who can work for the government 
menem was born and reared in la rioja the second of four sons of 
syrian immigrants who founded a successful vineyard and winery 
he notes with pride he has been reelected twice and does not 
dwell on the fact that his deficitridden province issues its own 
currency that is worthless elsewhere nor on the national 
implications of his solution to economic stagnation increased 
public spending 
eager for middle class support to push him past the 50 percent 
minimum he needs in the popular vote to win the election outright 
menem says he will honor the countrys foreign debt obligations and 
promote political stability social harmony and economic growth 
businessmen and professionals however are wary of his plans for 
such things as a social pact between labor capital and 
government the pact would he insists help set budget policy 
resolve wage disputes establish price levels 
many middleclass voters are troubled by the gaps between menems 
proposed policies and his personal opinions 
argentinas nearly 60billion foreign debt will be honored 
menem says although he maintains that repayment is a true 
immorality given the countrys need for investment capital he 
says he will seek to negotiate a fiveyear moratorium 
menem also attracts criticism random remarks that rarely are 
substantiated or followed up for example he has said 
the peronist party might try to impeach alfonsin on grounds of 
mishandling the economy 
col mohamed ali seineldin a military rebel leader is a 
brilliant soldier 
fidel castro has dramatically improved life in cuba 
paraguays dictator gen alfredo stroessner is a good 
friend of argentina 
what kind of government can we expect from that candidate and 
that party asks congresswoman maria christina guzman the 
argentine people know well enough there is a great danger that that 
government would be simply the waiting room to chaos 
angeloz who also heads the independent federal confederation 
ticket on which ms guzman is the vice presidential candidate calls 
menems proposals demagogic magic prescriptions and 
simplistic 
yet menems rallies are well attended his appearances in 
massmarket magazines frequent 
in speeches and interviews he quotes the bible european 
statesmen and philosophers and his partys revered founder and 
namesake gen juan domingo peron president in 194655 and for 10 
months ending with his death in 1973

in the 11 years since he last worked in the 
white house brent scowcroft has not minced words about his views on 
strategic policies to the point of openly criticizing the reagan 
administration on occasion 
now in his opening days as president bushs national security 
adviser scowcroft is shying away from discussing how his personal 
views might translate into bush administration policy 
the secretary of state should be the chief spokesman for the 
presidents foreign policy and the president makes foreign 
policy scowcroft smiling said in an interview with the 
associated press the national security adviser should be not 
exactly invisible but certainly not in the spotlight 
reticence aside scowcrofts influence promises to be as great as 
his experience bush and scowcroft worked closely once before when 
bush was cia director in 1976 and scowcroft was national security 
adviser to president ford 
scowcroft 63 said he has gained a sense of perspective since he 
began his first job at the white house as military aide to henry 
kissinger on the national security council staff in 1972 he rose 
quickly from the rank of air force colonel to threestar general 
and to national security adviser 197577 after ford replaced richard 
nixon and kissinger became secretary of state 
ive probably written and said more about the organization and 
the function of the nsc system than scowcroft said pausing 
anyone in the country 
he has a daunting assignment this time around to direct a 
complete review of us strategic interests an assessment that many 
arms control experts predict will change the american negotitating 
position toward the soviets and in the pentagon budget that reagan 
sent to capitol hill earlier this month 
the tasks seems to rest lightly on scowcrofts thin shoulders he 
is balding and slight five feet eight inches tall and weighs 130 
pounds probably a little less than i did at west point because i 
had more muscle then 
he keeps trim by jogging about three miles a night after 
watching abcs nightline late night interview show 
born in ogden utah he counts the mormon church and his faher as 
the significant early influences in his life 
there is a notion among the mormons that at the end of each day 
you ought to be able say ive made myself a better person or i 
have made things better by what i have done today said scowcroft 
but he said i am not a strict mormon i frequently have a 
glass of wine with dinner and i enjoy coffee i like to work at 
night said scowcroft who has disciplined himself to work on four 
hours of sleep a night 
every once in a while i crash and when i operate this way i 
fall asleep at the drop of hat he said 
i learned to do that from henry kissinger who does not require 
much sleep especially on trips we used to take about 1 oclock 
in the morning he would issue to the staff a whole bunch of things 
he wanted done by the next morning then he would go to bed and get 
up at 530 and expect to have them done said scowcroft with a 
hearty laugh 
scowcroft lives in a modest brick home in bethesda with marian 
his wife of 37 years their daughter karen works as an attorney in 
new york 
since leaving the white house and retiring from the military 
scowcroft has worked in the washington office of kissingers 
international consulting firm and has served as a member of the 
commission that investigated the irancontra affair and chairman of 
a presidential panel on strategic missile basing 
the basing panel known as the scowcroft commission charted some 
policies that are sharply at odds with those of the reagan 
administratrion scowcroft has come out strongly in favor of a 
singlewarhead mobile missile known as the midgetman 
and he ridiculed the administration for proposing at the moscow 
summit a system to base 10warhead mx missiles on rail lines on 
small bases in the southwest a plan he said in an oped piece last 
year would make them sitting ducks 
none of these ideas he has written make sense under a proposed 
strategic arms limitation treaty that would limit the number of both 
warheads and delivery vehicles such as missles and bombers 
such a regime scowcroft has written argues for singlewarhead 
mobile missiles dispersed over a large area such as the midgetman 
however reagan in his last budget proposal killed funding for 
the midgetman in favor of the 10warhead mx missile which would be 
deployed on rail cars on large bases in the southwest 
scowcroft declines to say publicly what he recommended to bush on 
such issues bush for his part said during the campaign that he 
liked both the mx and the midgetman although budget constraints 
argue against deploying both 
scowcroft prefers to discuss his vision of a white house security 
adviser with the leisure to try to do some longrange planning to 
sort of look out ahead to hypothesize the kind of world that we 
would like to see and then to look at the kind of forces that are 
at work for or against that kind of world 
and i think that where we want to go has an importance that it 
really hasnt had for much of the 40 years of the cold war and that 
is a lot of the old truths cold war relations with the allies 
economic relations all those things are changing now he said 
we are no longer just trying to frantically hold the line in 
europe for example to europe not an incitement to agression by the 
soviet union he said 
the world has changed vastly since scowcroft was 12 and read a 
book called west point today 
i fell in love with west point not with the military as such 
i didnt go because i wanted to spend 30 years in the 
military said scowcroft who spent 29 years in uniform 
after graduating from west point in 1947 scowcroft joined the 
newly created air force and flew fighters until he crashed in a p51 
mustang 
i would rather call it a forced landing he said with a 
laugh a crash sounds totally uncontrolled 
the forced landing crushed three vertebrae and he spent two 
years in a hospital recuperating and missing the korean war 
denied the opportunity to fly in combat scowcroft switched 
tracks earning masters and doctoral degrees from columbia 
university teaching russian history at west point learning 
serbocroatian and serving as deputy air attache at the us 
embassy in yugoslavia 195961 
reflecting on his years in uniform and at the white house 
scowcroft says he would like to be remembered by the epitath he 
served with distinction

the laser had many inventors but only one 
gordon gould is getting rich from it 
gould owns basic patents on two of the most important kinds of 
lasers gas discharge and optically pumped based on his graduate 
work at columbia university in the late 1950s 
gould 68 estimates he will make close to 2 million a year from 
patent licenses once all potential licensees are signed up most 
already are 
i was always more interested in the monetary outcome than any 
glory gould now a venture capitalist said in an interview this 
past week 
ironically gould is reaping profits from lasers precisely 
because it took until the 1980s for the patent office to recognize 
his contributions 
patents protect inventions for only 17 years if gould had won 
patents right away they would have expired by now before the laser 
market got big enough to produce significant license fees 
gould owns only 20 percent of the income from his patents 
sixtyfour percent is owned by the licensing agent patlex corp of 
los angeles headed by frank borman the former astronaut and 
exeastern airlines president the rest is owned by refac technology 
development corp the original licensing agent 
many laser makers and users say patlex is charging too much for 
use of the gould patents to that complaint the inventor has a 
oneword answer tough 
two other laser pioneers brothersinlaw charles townes and 
arthur schawlow shared a basic laser patent but never profited 
from it 
schawlow worked at atampt bell laboratories at the time of their 
work and townes a columbia university professor served as a 
consultant 
i feel i have an adequate livelihood and im not concerned 
about it townes 73 recalled in an interview last year id 
rather think about other things as long as i can get money to 
support my research 
townes said he continues to use lasers in astrophysics research 
its like getting a microscope on the sky 
gould takes an unsentimental approach to the laser but admits he 
had an emotional moment about four years ago 
i had eye surgery to pin back a detached retina you can 
imagine how i felt to be looking into that laser and knowing i 
played a part in getting it there

in a radical break with communist ideology three 
chinese economists have come up with a proposal to distribute 
stateowned property to the people in the form of stocks and bonds 
another group of young thinkers wants to establish a nationwide 
stock exchange based on the us model with a chinese version of the 
securities and exchange commission 
if realized the proposals would fundamentally change chinas 
economy and forever alter its political structure 
chances are slim that the proposals will win immediate approval 
but the promulgators are confident that in the long run china has no 
choice but to accept them 
that they are actually getting a hearing among chinese leaders is 
an indication that the state is unsure about its economic future and 
is looking for new solutions 
among the plethora of economic theories being debated in academic 
circles and in the official press of todays china the proposals 
lie on the radical fringe and stand as testimony to a new tolerance 
of ideas once regarded as heretical 
whether they will be put into effect is a different matter 
at the institute of economics at the chinese academy of social 
sciences hua sheng zhang xuejun and luo xiaopeng have decided that 
china must abandon state ownership which lies at the root of the 
communist party state 
in its stead they propose a system coyly termed individual 
ownership what they mean is private ownership but those words are 
still taboo in the land of karl marx and mao tsetung 
they also want the state to stop funding universities and 
thinktanks in a move designed to give china more free thought 
our goal is to liberate the chinese people said hua the 
36yearold director of the microeconomics department at the 
institute social justice the right of selfrealization is the 
essence of socialism and that has nothing to do with state 
control 
if we are to advance the government must stop treating the 
people like little children added zhang 35 a senior research 
fellow at the academy and the people must take responsibility for 
their lives 
most of chinas economy is staterun 
in the past staterun enterprises had to turn all of their 
profits over to the state which then handed funds back to the 
enterprises in accordance with their importance to society 
but under reforms pushed since 1978 staterun companies have 
been allowed to keep some of their profits 
the problem said zhang is that because the companies are still 
publicly owned few really seek profits and if they do the profits 
arent used to benefit the company theyre used to benefit its 
managers he added 
in some companies the factory manager is like a little 
emperor handing out bonuses to the people he likes 
in other firms managers avoid profits to assure themselves 
sources of scarce raw materials 
take the bicycle industry zhang said in an recent interview 
its prices have been freed for about a year but theres no true 
market why because manufacturers keep their prices low and sell to 
other firms who supply them with raw materials 
the trio criticizes chinas program to free prices as misguided 
because they say it has put the economic cart before the horse 
under our current system freed prices wont create a market 
because everything is still controlled by the state hua said 
their solution china should convert most enterprises not 
involved in national security to privately owned firms 
first university research institutes and other academic 
organizations would be given capital coupons with which they 
could purchase shares in companies 
by doing this the state would cut the amount of financial 
support it gives to these institutes and the institutes would 
become independent of the state and its ideological controls 
the second step entails the distribution of these capital 
coupons to workers in state enterprises the workers would use the 
coupons to buy shares in companies or to buy a house 
we made a big mistake when we outlawed property rights hua 
said referring to changes promulgated since chinas communist 
revolution 40 years ago such rights really are the key to 
political rights and economic rights we need to win them back 
under a second plan proposed by a group of young 
westerneducated economists the workers and institutions would be 
able to trade their shares in companies on a national stock exchange 
the exchange would be overseen by a governmental organization 
based on the us securities and exchange commission according to 
wang poming who was an analyst at the new york stock exchange 
before returning to china last year 
unlike the current situation in china where stocks pay fixed

if there was one constant in patrick 
edward purdys short and troubled life it was his itch to be 
somewhere else 
he started roaming early at age 14 running from an unhappy home 
and he seldom stopped over the past 10 years but the demons chasing 
purdy finally caught up with him last tuesday as he ended his 
transient life in a violent homecoming at his old elementary school 
here 
purdy 24 opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle on a crowded 
playground he killed five children and wounded 29 other youngsters 
and a teacher then he turned a pistol on himself and delivered a 
final fatal shot 
as residents of this central california town reeled in horror 
people who knew patrick purdy struggled to understand how the 
troubled young drifter could have turned into a murderous commando 
despite the public nature of his schoolyard slaughter purdy held 
a rage as private as it was explosive he knew how to build walls 
around his emotions sometimes shielding a darker nature from those 
who thought they knew him well 
where his aunt and uncle saw a polite young man working hard to 
overcome some bad breaks others saw a surly loner who plunged into 
suicidal moods tormented by alcohol drugs and a world he believed 
had done him wrong 
some former coworkers remember a hard worker who kept to himself 
and harmed nobody and relatives say purdy was wellread and 
articulate but others knew purdy as the high school dropout 
described in one police report as dangerous and suffering from 
mild mental retardation 
some saw him when he was down and out with a scraggly beard and 
ragged clothes others saw a cleanshaven handsome man with short 
blond hair tanned face and piercing blue eyes 
nobody saw him for long 
purdy crisscrossed the country living and working in stockton 
los angeles florida tennessee connecticut and texas among other 
places he hitchhiked or drove beatup old cars sometimes 
abandoning them when they broke down 
he was always on the go he couldnt keep still said his 
aunt julie michael 
his transient ways began long before he had a choice in the 
matter 
patrick edward purdy was the son of an army man patrick benjamin 
purdy born while the elder purdy was stationed at fort lewis near 
seattle the parents split within a few years and purdy stayed with 
his mother kathy who took him to south lake tahoe calif 
they also apparently lived for a while in stockton school 
records show that purdy attended kindergarten through third grade at 
cleveland elementary school scene of last weeks slaughter 
purdy had a stormy relationship with his mother who remarried 
twice after divorcing purdys father she is believed to be living 
in sacramento but could not be located 
by the age of 14 purdy had a serious drinking problem and he 
either left or was kicked out after the fights with his mother 
became too intense and frequent 
his father was killed in a traffic accident in september 1981 
but purdy didnt know for three months because he was on the road 
his aunt said 
by then he was in los angeles where he was making himself known 
to police under the alias eddie west 
between 1980 and 83 he racked up a number of arrests on charges 
including marijuana possession robbery prostitution and receiving 
stolen property none of the offenses involved extensive jail time 
and police say purdy did not stand out among the thousands of young 
toughs they see each year 
1984 found him in key west fla where he worked first for a 
nursery and then for a construction company workers there remember 
him for his strange talk of ufos but they say he was cleancut and 
a good worker 
he was a very lone wolf said richard mccarthy his boss at 
the nursery you used to see him sitting in the bar alone in the 
darkest corner and he wouldnt talk to anyone 
purdy quit in april 1985 and drifted back to the west coast 
dropping in occasionally to visit and pick up mail at his 
grandmothers house in lodi 15 miles north of stockton he joined 
the family for christmas that year 
but for most holidays he was on the road it was a world of few 
friends of living hand to mouth he told his aunt stories of living 
outside by a river in stockton heating up water in soda bottles to 
wash himself 
one of the few people he allowed close to him was his 
halfbrother albert gulart jr in april 1987 he and gulart were 
arrested for using a semiautomatic pistol to shoot at trees during 
a drunken spree near lake tahoe 
resisting arrest purdy yelled it was his duty to help the 
suppressed and to overthrow the suppressor later in his cell he 
tried to hang himself with a knotted shirt then slashed his wrists 
and wrote on the walls with blood 
a mental health report concluded he was dangerous and suffering 
from drug abuse and mild mental retardation 
but there were signs that purdy was trying to change his lifes 
downward spin late in 1987 he started welding classes at a 
community college in stockton and last january he started work at 
a stockton machine shop where his dour silence earned him the 
nickname smiley 
he was befriended by kelley riley 25 sister of the woman who 
managed the stockton hotel where purdy lived 
riley remembers him as nonviolent but prone to alcoholic binges 
and bouts of suicidal depression purdy trusted her enough to share 
his dreams of the perfect girl a nice pretty one with money 
riley said but he couldnt play cards with her constantly 
insisting that she was cheating

the latest government economic reports show 1988 inflation 
steadied and the housing industry slumped but private analysts 
foresee higher prices this year and claim the homebuilding business 
remains healthy 
none of the news thursday influenced the financial markets 
however stocks finished slightly higher and continued nearing 
precrash levels the dollar weakened because of aggressive selling 
by central banks and bonds were mixed 
the labor department said the rate of increase in consumer prices 
last year totaled 44 percent matching the 1987 gain 
the summer drought inflated food prices by 52 percent in 1988 
vs a 35 percent a year earlier but consumers got a break on 
energy costs which rose 05 percent vs 82 percent in 1987 
excluding food and energy categories inflation did accelerate 
from 42 percent in 1987 to 47 percent in 1988 many economists 
contend this measurement is more accurate because food and energy 
costs fluctuate sharply 
the core inflation is ticking up said samuel d kahan an 
economist with kleinwort benson government securities inc in 
chicago i would not treat last years number as something very 
calming 
nevertheless 1988 ended on a moderate note with 03 percent 
increases in both november and december 
in another report the commerce department said housing 
construction dropped 82 percent in 1988 to its lowest level in six 
years 
construction of singlefamily homes and apartments fell during 
1988 to leave total housing starts at 149 million units it was the 
poorest showing since the recession year of 1982 when 106 million 
units were built 
but private analysts said despite the decline which is likely to 
continue into the current year 1988 was a good year for the housing 
industry because the level of construction remained relatively high 
on wall street stock traders paid little attention to either 
report focusing instead on a generally improving investment 
atmosphere exactly 15 months after the unprecedented market crash 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial issues rose 036 to 223911

the story was different in foreign exchange where central banks 
slammed the dollar lower cooling a rally that had brought the us 
currency to its highest levels since early october

to take profits following wednesdays strong rally

general electric co says the decision to replace 
the chief executive at kidder peabody group with one of its most 
highlyregarded executives underscores ges commitment to the wall 
street securities firm it acquired in 1986 
on thursday michael a carpenter an executive vice president of 
ge capital part of ge financial services was named president and 
chief executive officer of kidder peabody group 
silas s cathcart a former ge director brought in as an interim 
chief executive in 1987 will stay on as chairman of kidder 
max c chapman jr a longtime kidder employee who had been 
running the group from his position as president of kidder peabody 
amp co the brokerdealer unit resigned to pursue other interests 
according to a statement from ge financial services 
lawrence a bossidy vice chairman and chief executive officer of 
the financial services unit said carpenters appointment is an 
expression of ges continued support and investment in the future of 
kidder 
analysts say installation of new kidder leadership reflects the 
corporate parents desire to exert greater control over kidders 
daytoday operations as well as ges latest attempt to deal with 
difficulties posed by the firm 
while at ge capital carpenter built a reputation as a savvy 
manager able to work well within ges corporate structure 
carpenter also will retain responsibility for the corporate 
finance group of ge capital which specializes in developing 
financing packages for leveraged buyouts he will continue 
reporting to wendt 
once the oldest privatelyheld firm on wall street kidder sold 
an 80 percent stake in itself to ge in april 1986 boosting kidders 
capital base and enabling it to compete more effectively with larger 
rivals 
the 124yearold firm suffered a major blow to its reputation 
when it became embroiled in the ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
kidder agreed in 1987 to pay a thenrecord 253 million settle 
civil charges with the securities and exchange commission 
the episode also prompted ge to make aggressive management 
changes at the firm in response to what it perceived as management 
weaknesses to led to kidders involvement in the scandal 
the management shakeups at kidder are seen by many as 
highlighting the problems that can occur when smokestack companies 
try to bring new types of business into their corporate fold as has 
happened frequently this decade 
ge management generally has gotten excellent marks for the 
handling of its expansion into financial services but analysts say 
some clashes are inevitable even in the most carefully handled 
situations 
while wall streeters pride themselves on an entreprenuerial 
spirit they often are criticized for following a strategy that 
focuses on shortterm rewards at the expense of longterm planning 
its tough for industrial companies to own wall street 
financial firms they drive the creative people out creative people 
feel limited suffocated said one analyst who asked not to be 
named its not like running an insurance company or a bank 
earlier this week two senior members of kidders merchant 
banking group announced their departures 
but in response to recent reports indicating ge may be sorry it 
bought kidder bossidy declared ge was not disappointed with 
kidders 1988 results he said kidders operating net income came to 
nearly 50 million in 1988 up about 20 percent over 1987 
on thursday ge reported its net income rose to 101 billion in 
the fourth quarter the first time quarterly earnings have exceeded 
1 billion for all of 1988 ge earned 339 billion after taxes up 
16 percent from 292 bllion in 1987 the earnings benefited from a 
strong showing by ge financial services the largest single ge 
business 
bossidy also emphatically denied reports that disenchantment with 
the profitability of the securities business could induce ge to sell 
off kidders retail business which could lead to the dismissal of 
2000 employees 
kidder underwent a major restructuring beginning in the wake of 
the october 1987 stock market crash as did most major wall streete 
firms to consolidate and reduce costs

a new company formed to launch a bid for general 
electric co plc said it was dropping the attempt which would have 
been britains largest ever takeover 
however metsun ltd in its announcement thursday left open the 
possibility of launching a future bid for the giant british 
electronics company 
the decision follows several recent significant events 
including last fridays announcement of a major joint venture 
between gec and its unrelated us counterpart general electric 
co metsun said 
metsun continues to believe that a new direction is needed at 
gec in order to enhance shareholder value the company said in a 
brief statement it doesnt consider that gec will achieve this by 
placing a substantial proportion of its business in a series of 
joint ventures over which gec and its shareholders mightnt exercise 
complete control 
metsun announced earlier this month that it had been formed to 
put together an international consortium which might or might not 
bid for gec 
plessey co another british elecronics company which is the 
target of a joint takeover attempt by gec and west germanys siemens 
ag had been expected to join a consortium bid for gec 
such participation would have been what wall street calls the pac 
man defense because of its similarity with the eatorbeeaten video 
game 
metsun said lazard brothers and co a merchant banker for both 
metsun and plessey had arranged talks with several international 
companies including ge american telephone and telegraph co and 
frances thomson sa in an effort to form a consortium to make an 
expected bid for gec of between 65 billion and 8 billion pounds 
that would be equivalent to around 11 billion to 141 billion 
metsun also announced that in view of the potential conflict 
of lazard brothers being adviser to both plessey and metsun the 
company had decided to replace lazard with baring brothers and co 
ltd 
the decision to drop the gec takeover came on baring brothers 
advice and lazard agreed with it metsun said 
the potential bid ran into trouble last thursday when the 
british government said it would conduct a threemonth investigation 
into the gecsiemens 17 billion pound 3 billion bid for plessey 
the move likely would obstruct any bid for gec by metsun until the 
investigations conclusion in early april 
last friday ge another party seen as central to metsuns plans 
announced its joint venture with gec 
ge will pay gec 325 million pounds 572 million under the 
agreement in which the two electronics giants will merge their 
european consumer products medical equipment and some of their 
electrical divisions 
the gegec venture the government investigation and plesseys 
defensive strategies make it really quite impossible to go ahead 
with a bid at this point said a metsun spokesman who wasnt 
identified in accordance with british practice

saying they would wage a proxy fight for control of 
the instant photography giant officials at shamrock holdings inc 
have sweetened their bid for polaroid corp to 32 billion 
shamrock said thursday it would pay 45 a share for all polaroid 
stock including 97 million shares recently issued to polaroids 
employee stock ownership plan the previous tender offer of 42 a 
share did not apply to the esop shares 
shamrock a television and radio company owned by the roy e 
disney family and based in burbank calif also indicated it would 
nominate a slate of candidates for election to polaroids board of 
directors at the companys may 9 annual meeting 
if polaroid shareholders vote to elect them shamrocks 
candidates would be committed to selling the company either under 
shamrocks offer or to any third party that made a bona fide higher 
offer said stanley p gold shamrocks president and chief 
executive 
polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips said the companys board 
would meet to review shamrocks revised offer and make a 
recommendation to shareholders but she said the date of the board 
meeting had not been set 
polaroid jumped 312 a share to 3987 thursday in active new 
york stock exchange trading 
after a court decision two weeks ago upheld polaroids employee 
stock ownership plan some securities analysts had predicted that 
shamrock would have to abandon its takeover attempt but the 
45ashare offer was seen on wall street as a strong indication 
that the fight will go on 
this definitely raises shamrocks credibility said alex 
henderson of prudential bache amp co but i doubt very seriously 
that polaroid is just going to roll over and play dead i dont 
think shamrock is going to be able to take them over without winning 
control of the board 
shamrock also announced that about 131 million polaroid shares 
or 183 percent of the outstanding stock had been tendered to 
shamrock and not withdrawn as of the close of business wednesday 
shamrock is fighting in court to try to invalidate the esop 
which it argues was designed specifically to forestall a takeover 
a delaware chancery court judge upheld the esop on jan 6 and 
shamrock has filed an appeal with the delaware supreme court oral 
arguments are scheduled for march shamrock said thursday that if 
the esop is invalidated it would raise its offer to 47 a share or 
about 336 billion 
polaroid based in cambridge mass has been resisting shamrock 
since july when the california company made a friendly but 
unsolicited offer of 40 a share 
shamrock launched its initial hostile offer of 42 a share in 
september last month more than 5000 of polaroids 8300 employees 
signed a petition saying they had no comfort or confidence that 
a takeover would benefit the company 
shamrock said its tender offer expires march 15 and is contingent 
on obtaining at least 90 percent of polaroids 716 million 
outstanding shares 
the suitor said it would finance the revised offer with its own 
equity about 14 billion from a highyield junk bond offering 
placed by the investment firms drexel burnham lambert inc and 
wertheim schroder amp co and 16 billion from banks mainly wells 
fargo bank and bank of nova scotia

that currency rates didnt move much and have already returned 
to their level before the joint intervention 
but murayama hinted the united states could move to raise its own 
interest rates due to inflation worries 
other dealers said trading was not active ahead of 
presidentelect bushs inauguration speech later today as investors 
were concerned bush might indicate a new monetary policy 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which shed 4315 points the 
previous day lost another 14102 points or 045 percent to fall 
further to 3117037 the index which lost 23316 points at the end 
of the morning trading could not erase the loss although it started 
to recover during the afternoon session 
volume traded on the first section was estimated at 11 billion 
shares 
following a 05 percentagepoint interest rate hike in several 
european nations including west germany switzerland and france the 
index quickly plunged as investors moved to the sidelines or sold 
for profit taking said a nikko securities dealer 
now investors are mainly concerned how the us monetary 
authorities would react but the majority think that the us 
central bank would maintain current discount rates even if it raises 
the prime lending rate the dealer said

dick lyng says he might sleep a bit longer this 
weekend and will take it a lot easier from here on 
lyng 70 probably wont fade completely into the woodwork after 
his hitch as ronald reagans secretary of agriculture ends today he 
plans to continue living in the washington area and says he may 
lend a hand if the right cause comes along 
clayton yeutter 58 is george bushs choice as secretary of 
agriculture and yeutter doesnt like to sleep late any time hes a 
supercharged law and economics graduate from eustis neb whos 
expected to call a lively bush tune at the agriculture department 
the senate agriculture committee said thursday that yeutters 
confirmation hearing may be the latter part of next week possible 
on thursday or friday 
yeutter enjoys popular support among many farm groups and members 
of congress after serving 3 years as the us trade representative 
the no 1 negotiator on agricultural and other trade issues and 
hes not expected to run into much trouble in his senate 
confirmation proceeding 
but committee members will want to know from yeutter how he 
thinks george bush will be kinder and gentler to american farmers 
they will want to know how bush intends to do this without spending 
more money and without driving more hardpressed farmers into 
foreclosure 
the senate panel may seek more information from yeutter on 
agricultural trade negotiations under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade and how the impasse with the european economic 
community over the use of meat hormones can be unsnarled 
one of the major issues facing yeutter will be legislation to 
replace modify or extend the 1985 farm law which will expire in 
1990 after its fiveyear run 
what about the level of price and income supports available to 
farmers under various usda commodity programs 
the 1985 law significantly reduced price supports and enabled the 
reagan administration to take giant steps nearer the 
marketoriented system of us agriculture that many had sought 
lyng was a strong advocate of this line and so is yeutter 
much of the time lately the action has involved international 
trade including the us proposal to gatt for a phasing out of all 
subsidies and barriers that interfere with free world commerce the 
furor of the european ban on hormonetreated meat is an example 
yeutter and lyng were a strong team with both talking tough and 
showing muscle to the doubtful europeans prompting eec officials to 
speak of rambostyle diplomacy on the part of the insistent 
americans 
with lyng departed the senate could want to know what kind of 
role yeutter will play in the continuing trade negotiations and 
whether bush and his choice for us trade representative carla 
hills will keep standing tall on behalf of american farmers 
if these arent enough question materials the senators only have 
to dust off copies of reagans final budget proposals for fiscal 
1990 and ask yeutter about 
lopping 97 billion off usdas spending in the year that will 
begin on oct 1 including cuts in commodity programs and rural 
development 
barring subsidized school lunches to children from affluent 
homes thereby requiring them to pay 26 cents more per meal 
helping pay for fighting fires in national forests through 
deductions from each states share of proceeds from timber sales and 
mining 
the concept of decoupling as a way of paying subsidies to 
farmers without linking the payments to kind of crops they produce 
the payments would be reduced gradually over a period of years and 
could then be phased out entirely

the agriculture department says turkey output 
is not expanding as rapidly this year and that prices will be higher 
production is expected to increase about 3 percent to an 
estimated 405 billion pounds from about 3033 billion pounds in 
1988 that would be only half the 6 percent increase in turkey meat 
output from 1987 to 1988 the departments economic research service 
said 
turkey producers are slowing their rate of increase after two 
years of lackluster returns the agency said wholesale hen 
turkey prices in the eastern region averaged 61 cents per pound in 
1988 and are expected to average 63 to 69 cents in 1989 
another report which was issued by the departments agricultural 
statistics board said that surveys of turkey growers in 20 major 
producing states intend to boost the number of birds not in pounds 
by 7 percent from last year 
the report said us turkey production in 1988 totaled more than 
242 million birds up 1 percent from about 2404 million in 1987

a new rule allowing the separation or 
uncoupling of beef quality and beef yield grades has been approved 
and will take effect april 9 the agriculture department said 
j patrick boyle head of the departments agricultural marketing 
service said thursday the change was in response to a petition 
filed in june 1987 by the american meat institute and the national 
cattlemens association 
the rule allows the beef industry to determine whether to have 
carcasses graded by usda for quality or for yield or both boyle 
said previously a carcass had to be grade both for quality and 
yield or not graded at all 
meat grading is a voluntary program offered by the agency and is 
paid for by user fees 
boyle said the trade associations asked for the rule changes in 
order to utilize new more efficient technologies now available for 
preparing beef carcasses one of which is hotfat trimming just 
after slaughter instead of trimming after the carcasses are 
chilled as is the current practice

in a move to spin off its holding in an 
unprofitable cellular telephone business affiliated publications 
inc publisher of the boston globe and billboard magazine has 
announced a major restructuring 
separately british telecommunications plc announced in london 
that it had agreed to pay roughly 15 billion for a 22 percent 
stake in the cellular business mccaw cellular communications inc 
of kirkland wash 
affiliated owns about 43 percent of mccaw which is the largest 
cellular telephone operator in the united states and which has 
suffered losses in recent years during the startup phase of its 
operations 
wall street analysts said the restructuring announced thursday 
would benefit affiliated by separating its profitable publishing 
operations from the troubled cellular business which has dragged 
down its stock price but they also called the british telecom 
investment a strong expression of faith in the future of the 
cellular operations 
john reidy an analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc said 
british telecoms investment values mccaw at about 140 per pop 
an industry term for each person residing in the companys cellular 
franchise area 
most of the cellular companies were selling in the high 80s or 
90s per pop reidy said this is a very smart investor saying 
its willing to pay 140 we view that as a tremendous endorsement 
of the us cellular industry 
under the restructuring which requires approval from 
shareholders and federal regulators bostonbased affiliated would 
split into two parts 
the globe and billboard businesses would become a new entity 
globebillboard holding co held by affiliateds current 
stockholders reidy said globebillboard stock would probably sell 
for 13 to 14 and earn about 90 cents a share this year 
affiliated stockholders would also receive 084 of a share of 
mccaw for each share of affiliated they hold following the spinoff 
mccaw would issue 37 million new shares of stock and sell them to 
british telecom for 4150 a share or 153 billion 
affiliated stock rose 2 a share to 40 in composite trading 
thursday on the new york stock exchange mccaw jumped 550 to close 
at 3450 a share the prices of many other cellular issues also 
rose in reaction to the british telecom announcement 
under this plan affiliated will be able to focus its attention 
on its core publishing and media businesses while mccaw continues to 
concentrate on building its personal communications business 
william o taylor affiliateds chairman said in a news release 
british telecom which already owns cellular telephone interests 
in britain said the move anticipates the globalization of 
telecommunications markets 
it also strengthens the companys peripheral businesses at a time 
of an expected slowdown in regulated telecommunications markets in 
britain according to british telecom chairman iain vallance 
the british telecommunications giant holds 60 percent of cellnet 
one of two licensed cellular telephone operators in britain 
our investment in mccaw is seen by both sides as a real 
operating partnership not just a financial arrangement vallance 
said 
affiliated posted a loss of 2652 million in the first nine 
months of 1988 including a 372 million loss from its share of 
mccaw cellular 
mccaw posted a net loss of 2048 million in the nine months and 
had an operating loss of 446 million in the same period a year 
earlier the company has indicated the losses were consistent with 
its expectations of the cost of the startup phase of its cellular 
operations 
british telecom will obtain a mixture of mccaw class a and b 
shares giving it a total of 22 percent of the enlarged share 
capital as well as 22 percent voting power 
the a shares carrying one vote each are traded over the 
counter the b shares carry 10 votes each 
after the restructuring the board of 19 mccaw directors would 
consist of four members appointed by british telecom 10 appointed 
by the mccaw family two by affiliated publications and three 
independent directors

interior secretary donald p hodel took steps 
in his last day on the job to boost the nations oil production by 
granting new benefits to oil companies 
following reports this week of slumping us oil production 
hodel on thursday lowered the rates oil companies pay to drill on 
leased federal land and recommended the vast alaska wildlife refuge 
be opened to oil exploration 
decreasing the leasing fees for millions of acres in the west 
could cost taxpayers an estimated 35 million annually said marta 
witt a spokeswoman for the departments bureau of land management 
the move published thursday in the federal register and 
scheduled to take effect march 1 will lower leasing rates that now 
range from 2 to 3 down to 1 per acre on leases issued before 
1987 later leases carry a different schedule of fees 
this action is consistent with other steps the department has 
taken over the past two years when oil prices bottomed out and us 
production began to dwindle to the point of serious concerns to the 
point of even national security impact said timothy locke a 
spokesman for blm 
according to witt about 70 million acres of federal land in 
several western states are currently leased to oil exploration 
firms about half what was under lease six years ago about half 
those lands are already leased for 1 per acre she said 
we hope this decreases the holding costs for these existing 
leases said witt we dont envision this leased acreage being 
increased so much as we hope that what is already leased remains in 
the hands of companies longer and the savings are used to develop 
the land 
in the second move hodel recommended that congress allow native 
alaska corporations to trade ownership of land they hold for mineral 
rights to thousands of acres in the federal arctic national wildlife 
refuge and other refuges in alaska interior department spokesman 
tom wilson said 
the right to allow such exchanges rests with congress congress 
last year received a report from the general accounting office that 
trades the department wanted to make vastly overstated the value of 
the land the government was to receive 
the federal land would remain us government property with the 
indian eskimo and aleut corporations taking over rights to what oil 
analysts project as massive oil deposits possibly as large as the 
huge prudhoe bay field 65 to 100 miles to the west 
environmentalists have opposed reagan administration moves to 
allow oil exploration of the refuge wilson said hodels 
recommendation came after the department completed a twoyear 
environmental impact statement 
the american petroleum institute announced wednesday that us 
imports jumped 9 percent in 1988 to the highest levels in nine 
years at the same time api reported that domestic oil production 
sagged to a 12year low of 81 million barrels a day last year down 
3 percent from 1987 
the actions this week are a reaction to the same kind of 
statistics weve been seeing that show problems in american 
production said witt 
meanwhile the agriculture department on thursday proposed new 
rules that will give the agency a say in the leasing of national 
forest land to oil and gas developers leasing authority has been 
held exclusively by the blm but legislation in 1987 expanded the 
authority of the secretary of agriculture

tyson foods attempting to strengthen its 
position as the nations top poultry processor raised its bid for 
holly farms to 6350 a share or 115 billion as the holly farms 
board of directors was meeting to decide the companys fate 
late thursday holly farms said in a news release from its 
corporate headquarters in memphis tenn that the board was still 
considering the increased bid from tyson tysons previous bid had 
been 60 a share 
holly farms the giant chicken processor is the subject of a 
bidding war between two of the nations largest chicken producers 
conagra the omaha nebbased food conglomerate holly farms 
sought to acquire the company has offered a stock swap worth about 
5925 a share or 107 billion for the company 
tyson successfully sued in delaware state court to block holly 
farms proposed merger with conagra 
the release from holly farms said the board meeting in new york 
has not reached a conclusion with respect to the tyson proposal 
and there could be no assurance that the boards deliberation would 
result in a recommendation of the tyson proposal 
holly farms also noted in the release that conagra had thus far 
declined to increase its bid for holly farms 
a tyson spokesman said he thought the prospects for his company 
acquiring holly farms looked good 
were hopeful and optimistic that some agreement will be made 
by today said bob justice from tysons springdale office 
hopefully in our favor 
an industry analyst said he had learned that holly farms had 
nearly agreed at one point thursday to the new tyson offer but then 
reconsidered 
they had pretty much come to the conclusion earlier today that 
tyson would be their new owner said david aney editor of broiler 
industry magazine and an industry observer for 12 years the 
arkansas democrat newspaper in little rock reported today but as 
the lawyers and the legal people sat down to hash out the 
ramifications it became more and more difficult to come together 
they finally pulled back from the table and are exploring other 
avenues right now 
i think its still very much up in the air he said 
conagra spokesman walt casey generally declined comment on the 
statement in the holly farms release about conagra 
we had hoped really expected that there might be some sort of 
announcement sometime today casey said 
he said conagra is still more than interested in acquiring 
holly farms we have a merger agreement with holly farms he 
said that has not evaporated 
tysons stock closed at 1550 a share thursday down 25 cents 
in trading of 368000 shares more than normal holly farms closed 
at 6237 up 75 cents with 540000 shares traded conagra closed 
at 3075 up 50 cents in trading of 169000 shares 
the holly farms board of directors began meeting wednesday to 
consider final offers from tyson and conagra 
last fall tyson offered to buy holly farms for 52 a share a 
friendly offer worth about 900 million 
if conagra wins the right to acquire holly farms the new company 
would be the nations top chicken processor tyson has 141 percent 
of the market while conagra is second with 95 percent and holly 
farms has 66 percent 
if holly farms board recommends a sale to conagra a food 
conglomerate and shareholders go along with that recommendation 
holly farms executives have said the holly farms operation would be 
largely independent 
if the holly farms board recommends that shareholders sell their 
stock to tyson foods and the shareholders follow that advice holly 
farms will become part of the poultry empire founded by don tyson

texaco was fined 750000 and a former 
employee was placed on three years probation after pleading guilty 
to charges of falsifying a critical safety test for an offshore oil 
platform 
texaco had agreed to plead guilty to charges brought under the 
federal outer continental shelf lands act that bobby r brogdin 48 
decided not to test a blowout preventer on platform harvest 11 
miles off the santa barbara coast 
brogdin was unable to find the necessary tool to remove a part so 
the test could be conducted according to a memorandum filed in 
federal court 
later brogdin allegedly instructed workers with the heimerich 
and payne international drilling co to falsify the test so that 
texaco would not be fined for failing to conduct the blowout test 
while noting that brogdin a bakersfield resident was a 
decent hardworking caring person us district judge david 
kenyon said thursday if this thing had gone it could have blown 
everyone to kingdom come 
in addition to placing brogdin on three years probation kenyon 
fined him 5000 noting brogdin already had paid a high price in 
losing his job 
assistant us attorney janet goldstein wrote in a sentencing 
memorandum that an investigation into the incident revealed other 
shortcomings in certain testing procedures during late 1986 
the investigation has revealed that texacos general practices 
and procedures in conducting tests in these early months left much 
to be desired from a safety and environmental perspective 
goldstein wrote 
texaco attorney keate worley disputed the claims of lax 
procedures in the report

federal prosecutors will seek more than 1 
million in fines against rockwell international corp which pleaded 
guilty to criminal charges stemming from double billing on an air 
force satellite contract 
as part of an agreement with the prosecutors the company entered 
a conditional guilty plea thursday in us district court to one 
count of conspiracy and one count of contempt of court stemming from 
about 450000 in overcharges in 1983 
the conditional plea means that if rockwell successfully appeals 
an early ruling in the case its plea will be stricken 
us attorney robert bonner said his office would seek a fine of 
well in excess of 1 million 
rockwell the el segundo calif company that made the b1b 
bomber and space shuttle among other government and private 
projects originally was charged with seven counts of conspiracy 
mail fraud and contempt 
the company was accused of overcharging the air force for work on 
one of a series of navstar global positioning satellites which are 
used by military and civilian navigators to pinpoint their position 
the government alleged rockwells satellite systems division in seal 
beach calif billed the air force for the same work under two 
contracts 
the contempt charge was filed because in a civil settlement that 
ended an earlier investigation of alleged false billing for labor 
charges on the space shuttle rockwell promised to refrain from 
fraudulent billing 
the conspiracy count carries a maximum fine of 500000 the 
judge has unlimited authority to impose fines for contempt 
sentencing was set for feb 24 
rockwells attorney james neal repeated the companys 
contention that the double billing was planned by employees without 
the knowledge or consent of upperlevel executives 
the company says it discovered the fraud and reported it to the 
pentagon under procedures established for such cases and therefore 
should not have been charged in the first place 
a defense motion to dismiss the indictment on those grounds was 
rejected by us district judge consuelo marshall 
the company plans to appeal that ruling neal said 
neal said the company behaved properly once it discovered the 
double billing 
we informed the government of the conduct we fired the 
employees neal said adding that the company had offered to repay 
any overcharges 
bonner rejected rockwells contention that it was absolved of 
guilt by reporting the double billing to the government rockwells 
disclosure to the defense contracting agency came 10 months after an 
air force audit uncovered billing irregularities bonner told 
reporters outside of court 
the prosecution also rejected the companys contention that the 
double billing amounted to wrongdoing by individuals rather than the 
corporation 
evidence introduced at the trial of one of the employees 
suggested that at least some higher rockwell executives knew of 
attempts to cover up the fraud said assistant us attorney george 
b newhouse jr 
a rockwell manager robert zavodnik 47 has pleaded guilty to 
lying to the government and conspiracy and is awaiting sentencing 
his supervisor donald carter 60 was acquitted of the same charges 
by a federal jury

western reaction to the soviet unions 
announcement last week that 1988 crop production dropped to 195 
million metric tons down sharply from 1987 production and far below 
the kremlins goal was a bit overblown says an agriculture 
department analyst 
since last nov 9 the usda has been estimating the 1988 soviet 
grain crop at 200 million tons down from 2114 million tons in 1987 
and 2101 million tons in 1986 moscows target was 235 million tons 
christian foster who specializes in soviet agriculture for the 
departments economic research service said the preliminary 
estimate of 195 million tons announced by stepan sitaryan first 
deputy chairman of the state planning committee was not too far off 
base from the usda forecast 
but the announcement drew big headlines in the west and raised 
questions about the soviet unions agricultural outlook 
the press did make a big deal out of the soviet number 
foster said in a telephone interview but in fact the two 
numbers are very very close and 195 million tons is not a poor 
crop by any means 
foster acknowledged that 1988 grain production was far less than 
the 235 million tontarget set by moscow planners but he said the 
targets are rarely met 
theyre still calling for 250 million tons of grain by 1990 and 
260 million to 280 million tons of grain by 1995 foster said 
these are all dreams on their part but they continue to call for 
them 
foster added its nothing new that theyre not meeting those 
targets at the same time i guess its nothing that you can just 
ignore 
soviet grain production often has suffered wide swings from year 
to year in 1975 for example output dropped to 1401 million tons 
and then rebounded to 2238 million tons in 1976 production 
remained relatively high for several years reaching 2374 million 
tons in 1978 a record that still stands 
but the early 1980s brought some short crops and the fiveyear 
average of 1981 through 1985 harvests was slightly more than 180 
million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal for example to 
367 bushels of wheat or 394 bushels of corn 
foster said that 1988 production is still a good crop when 
compared with the fiveyear average of soviet grain output 
moreover he said the average of the last three years of more than 
205 tons annually is unprecedented in the soviet union 
thats certainly not anything to sneeze at foster said 
another point to consider is that moscow publishes grain 
production yields on the basis of bunker weight which is a 
gross measure and doesnt take into account high moisture content 
trash and waste he said the usda to compensate includes annual 
estimates of dockage foreign matter and wasted grain 
for instance last year 1987 when they supposedly produced 
211 million tons of grain usda estimated very conservatively that 
30 million tons of that or about 14 percent couldnt even be 
included foster said 
the dockage and waste in the 1988 soviet harvest has been 
estimated at 22 million tons he said thus the yeartoyear 
difference in the net amount of useable grain is less than what it 
appears at first glance 
moscow has been importing greater quantities of grain the last 
couple of years including large orders of us wheat and corn under 
a recently extended longterm agreement between the two countries 
in all the soviet union may import from all foreign sources a 
total of 325 million tons in 198889 slightly more than in 198788 
but still far below the 198485 level of 554 million tons 
according to a usda report last week 
as of midjanuary moscow had bought 102 million tons of us 
corn 13 million tons of wheat 500000 tons of grain sorghum 
450000 tons of soybeans and more than 11 million tons of soybean 
meal for delivery in 198889 under terms of the longterm agreement 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is trying to reform his 
nations agriculture through a number of innovations including the 
larger and improved use of more inputs such as fertilizer and 
pesticides and by encouraging workers on large collective and state 
farms to operate under lease arrangments so they can be rewarded for 
greater production 
a meeting of the communist partys policymaking central 
committee is scheduled for march to consider reforms in the farm 
sector 
foster said its too early to judge whether gorbachevs program 
so far has been a success or failure 
if you look at the average production of the last three 
years it shows that something has happened since gorbachev came 
in he said but for the most part i think reform measures 
havent made a big difference yet 
one of the most encouraging moves however involves the 
intensive technology for soviet agriculture which calls for 
increasing the amount of fertilizer pesticides and other items and 
also the improved use of such materials using them at the proper 
times in the correct amounts foster said

the head of the un population agency said friday 
she hoped new us president george bush would end a threeyear us 
boycott of agency funding programs linked to alleged coercive 
abortions in china 
dr nafis sadik executive director of the un fund for 
population activities said we see a new opportunity with the new 
administration for resuming us participation in family planning 
programs 
the united states has withheld about 85 million from the unfpa 
since 1985 charging that chinese family planning programs backed by 
the unfpa involve coercive abortions 
we are not supporting any abortion program anywhere in the 
world sadik said she said chinese officials had stressed to her 
that although there are isolated cases of coercion china does not 
force women to undergo abortions 
she said bush was strongly supportive of population policies 
when he was us ambassador to the un in 197173 and should have 
special sympathy for china where he also lived in 197475 as head 
of the us liaison office 
sadik from pakistan said she also told the chinese that they 
should work harder to improve the image of their family planning 
program which is striving to hold down a population which has 
reached 11 billion 
since 1980 china has tried to enforce a onechild per couple 
policy the policy has had some successes in the cities but has met 
resistance in the countryside where the return of family farming has 
made it advantageous to have more children 
newly affluent farmers are also willing to pay heavy fines 
imposed for giving birth to two or more children after dipping in 
the early 1980s the rate of population growth has begun to creep up 
again and demographers now estimate the population at the end of 
the century will be about 128 billion well above the original 
target of 12 billion 
the chinese dr sadik said are not quite sure what they can 
do to increase acceptance of family planning 
she said the stress is on more thorough education and better 
clinical services 
the unfpa she said is urging china to improve the quality of 
its contraceptive devices 
prod a laquian deputy representative of the unfpa in beijing 
said 50 million chinese woven wear a stainless steel intrauterine 
device that is often ineffective as a contraceptive 
he said 10 percent of women wearing the iud become pregnant and 
that 50 to 70 percent of women who obtain abortions were usng the 
faultyliuds 
dr sadik said production of effective contraceptives will be the 
top priority in a proposed 57millionus dollar unfpa aid program 
for china in the 199094 period funding will also go to maternal 
and child health information and publicity for family planning 
demographic training and programs for women 
she said the program will be presented to the unfpa governing 
council in june at which time the united states a member of the 
council will have to take a stand my hope is that the united 
states and china dont want a confrontation 
the unfpa will have a budget this year of about 190 million 
dollars with china the second largest recipient of funds after 
india 
dr sadik said african countries many which have just begun 
family planning programs have been the worst hit by the withdrawal 
of us funds 
she said other donors have increased their contributions in 
recent years but she said that as a result of the us pullout 
weve had to stretch the programs out and reduce their scope we 
did lose some momentum

european foreign ministers likely will 
delay their tough duties on some us imports in an effort to defuse 
tensions over a european ban on hormonetreated meat from america 
officials said today 
the foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the european economic 
community will meet monday to discuss the conflict which was 
sparked jan 1 when the trading bloc imposed a prohibition on us 
meat from cattle treated with growth hormones 
the ban affected about 100 million in sales of us beef and 
veal 
washington countered with 100 percent duties on a range of 
european food imports also affecting about 100 million in trade 
nico wegter a community spokesman said the foreign ministers 
will be asked to put into effect as soon as possible countermeasures 
that would slap stiff duties on american imports of dried fruit and 
walnuts 
however other officials said that a number of countries appear 
to want to defer setting a date to give the two sides more time to 
resolve the dispute particularly with george bush being sworn in as 
the new us president today 
the officials who demanded anonymity said the ministers may 
also want to await the outcome of a feb 8 meeting of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the eec intends to ask the 96nation 
gatt to declare the us retaliatory measures in violation of the 
international bodys rules 
the genevabased gatt attempts to remove trade barriers and 
ensure the free movement of goods worldwide 
many us farmers treat their animals with growth hormones a 
practice us officials said is safe the eec said it believed such 
meat poses a health risk 
in strausbourg france the european parliament today backed the 
meat ban and urged the united states to suspend its retaliatory 
measures until the dispute is settled through gatt the next gatt 
meeting is set for feb 8 
on thursday eec external relations commissioner frans andriessen 
said he was considering submitting the ban to an international 
scientific panel

rjr nabisco incs prospective new owner said 
today it will sell the foodtobacco giants holdings in south 
africa two days after michigan withdrew from a fund used to help 
finance the record 2453 billion takeover because of a new state 
law barring investments in that country 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the new york investment house that 
won the bidding for rjr late last year confirmed reports that it 
plans to sell royal beechnut to the divisions south african 
management and sell the south african preserving co as soon as 
possible after the takeover is formally completed 
the disclosures made via kohlbergs public relations agent kekst 
amp co appeared to be a reaction to the announcement wednesday by 
michigan officials that they would prohibit a 110 million state 
pension investment in a kohlberg fund that will help finance the rjr 
deal 
michigan treasurer robert bowman said such an investment 
conflicted with a law effective jan 1 banning state investments in 
companies with ties to south africa due to that countrys policy of 
apartheid or race separation 
bowmans move marked the second state to pull out of the kohlberg 
fund because of the rjrsouth african relationship possibly 
signaling more defections from pensionfund investors that are 
considered important financiers of the deal earlier massachusetts 
withdrew 25 million 
rjr is one of 95 us companies with south african involvement 
according to a list bowman compiled in compliance with the michigan 
law which took effect jan 1 
bowman said wednesday that kohlberg officials had indicated to 
him the south african holdings would be sold off as soon as the 
acquisition of rjr was completed but he said the new law still 
required state withdrawal because rjrs south african interests 
havent been sold yet 
kohlberg said michigans withdrawal would have no effect on 
completion of the rjr takeover which is to be financed largely by 
bank debt and the sale of highrisk highyield junk bonds 
rjr is an atlantabased maker of hundreds of consumer items 
ranging from oreo cookies to winston cigarettes kohlberg won a 
bidding war with rjr management to acquire the company nov 30

a british tycoon suffered a fresh reversal friday 
in his fouryear war to wrest the harrods department store from the 
alfayed brothers of egypt in one of britains most bitter business 
rivalries 
the court of appeal reversed a high court ruling won by roland w 
tiny rowland four days ago ordering the government to refer the 
alfayeds 1985 11 billion acquisition of harrods owner house of 
fraser plc to the monopolies and mergers commission 
that commission could have ordered the unprecedented divestiture 
of the 100store retailing group 
fridays ruling which rowland is appealing to the house of 
lords britains highest court is the latest twist in a saga more 
like a primetime soap opera than a corporate dispute 
rowland is the silverhaired 71yearold chief executive of 
lonrho plc the farflung british conglomerate with holdings that 
range from the observer newspaper to extensive interests in africa 
his dream of owning harrods was shattered in what he considers a 
most galling manner as part of his maneuverings he sold his 30 
percent stake in house of fraser to the alfayeds believing them to 
be unlikely competitors only to see the egyptians use the stake to 
snatch the prize from his grasp 
since then he has pursued a strenuous expensive antialfayed 
campaign through the observer brochures the courts and regulators 
mohamed alfayed 55 is a paunchy balding and flamboyant 
businessman whose family has interests in shipping real estate in 
europe and the ritz hotel in paris he has spent millions 
refurbishing the 139yearold flagship harrods store in london his 
pride and joy chairman of house of fraser he occasionally works 
behind harrods counters 
an anglophile who has lived in england for 30 years alfayed 
recently was pictured in the times of london fishing with his son on 
his scottish estate 
lonrho has accused the alfayeds mohamed aly and salah of 
exaggerating their background and wealth to win credibility and of 
lying about the source of the money for the takeover 
it has alleged that the alfayeds were indirectly financed by the 
sultan of brunei the worlds richest man with whom alfayed has 
done business 
inspectors from the serious fraud office are investigating the 
takeover lonrhos allegations are denied by both the alfayeds and 
the sultan 
lonrho also accuses house of fraser of running up large debts to 
modernize harrods which are likely to hurt the business 
privately held house of fraser does not disclose financial 
results 
rowland has written in the observer that the affair is the 
worst thing ive ever seen in business that deceits triumph so 
well and can even find apologists when they are exposed 
alfayed told the sunday times last summer my conscience is 
clear i have kept my dignity can rowland say the same thing 
he added there is no way ill sell harrods it will be in my 
family for 1000 years 
rowlands chance for a victory came when the high court threw the 
fight toward the monopolies and mergers commission the only 
regulatory body which could force the alfayeds to sell the company 
a divestiture possibly worth as much as 35 billion 
the threejudge court also said trade secretary lord young had 
improperly refused to publish a report of a government inquiry into 
the takeover and told him to reconsider 
the court of appeals said it would publish its reasons for 
reversing the rulings on monday 
the drama began in 1975 when mohamed alfayed lonrhos second 
largest shareholder briefly joined its board of directors 
later lonrho built up a 299 percent stake in house of fraser 
and in 1981 tried to buy it the monopolies commission blocked the 
takeover for competitive reasons whereupon lonrho sold its stake to 
the alfayeds 
the alfayeds launched their friendly offer in 1985 just days 
before the monopolies commission too late decided to clear 
lonrhos bid after all

stroh brewery co hopes a new blue label and a 
change in its script strohs logo in april will better denote a 
premium beer 
strohs white gold black and red label will become 
predominantly a rich blue a deep blue jack barthwell strohs 
vice president for corporate communications said thursday 
the strohs typeface will be changed to make the lettering 
seem to pop out catching the eye barthwell said 
packaging for stroh light will change from white to silver which 
barthwell said better communicates the notion of light beer to the 
consumer 
in addition to the label changes stroh plans to increase its use 
of longneck bottles which barthwell said have regained popularity 
with consumers 
the changes were suggested by hal riney amp partners of san 
francisco which became strohs advertising agency in july 
barthwell said 
strohs beer sales dropped 54 percent in 1988 according to beer 
marketers insights an industry newsletter 
while strohs announced a packing facelift rival brewer adolph 
coors co recently said it would partially roll back a packaging 
change citing customer confusion 
the golden colo brewer said thursday it would abandon the 
original draft tag it began putting on packing for its flagship 
beer seven months ago saying too many customers thought the brews 
ingredients had been changed 
the new labels simply will say coors said mike marranzino 
brand director for the brewer 
he said the label design changes made when the original draft 
name was added will be retained because beer drinkers like the 
contemporary look

dow chemical co said friday it decided to 
keep its middle name as well as the first and last after a 
sixmonth study concluded the company shouldnt change its 
92yearold identity 
dows president and chief executive officer frank popoff said 
an internal committee and an outside consultant looked into changing 
the corporate identity for more than six months before recommending 
against any change 
company spokesman tom henderson said he did not know how much the 
study cost he declined to reveal any of the alternate names or 
identities that may have been considered saying such information 
was confidential 
in october reports on the study said the company was considering 
dropping chemical from its name henderson said at the time that 
if there were to be a name change it would be because of dows 
expanding role in nonchemical fields including insulation and 
household goods 
henderson said friday he didnt think that the association of the 
dow name with napalm explosives and the agent orange defoliant used 
during the vietnam war had a lasting detrimental effect on the 
company 
i dont think it was part of the consideration of changing the 
name he said we are not inundated any more with negatives

a top aide to finance minister pierre beregovoy 
resigned friday saying he would fight suggestions he may be 
implicated in an insider trading scandal that has grown into a major 
embarrassment for the socialist government 
alain boublil beregovoys chief of staff said in his 
resignation letter that he has been the object of a serious 
campaign of rumors and accusations without being able to defend 
myself because of the reserve required by my position if this 
silence were to continue it could lend credence to these slanders 
us and french investigators are examining large purchases late 
last year of stock in the american packaging company triangle 
industries inc just before it was acquired by pechiney sa a french 
governmentowned aluminum manufacturer 
two close associates of president francois mitterrand were among 
the investors who bought large amounts of triangle stock when it was 
trading at about 10 per share then made huge profits when pechiney 
offered 56 per share nov 21 in its friendly takeover 
because pechiney is stateowned boublil and other senior 
government officials were kept informed of the secret negotiations 
last fall between triangle and pechiney 
rogerpatrice pelat one of mitterrands closest friends and max 
theret a businessman with close links to the socialists have 
denied getting inside tips about the pending deal the said they 
made their investments based on publicly available information 
boublil 41 a former advisor to mitterrand has not been 
publicly accused of anything but french news accounts of the 
scandal have frequently speculated he might have been involved 
based on his key position 
i am resigning so that i can respond to my accusers boublil 
said in his letter 
in accepting the resignation beregovoy said boublil was the 
victim of a campaign of rumors and said he was confident boublil 
would be able to defend his honor 
the pechiney affair has blossomed into a major scandal in the 
french press which has linked it to controversy over the 
governments role in an unsuccessful corporate raid on societe 
generale the institution was one of the stateowned banks sold to 
private investors by the previous conservative government of premier 
jacques chirac which held power from 19861988 
the french stock exchange watchdog body the commission des 
operations de bourse has said it has no evidence to support 
suggestions that businessmen close to the socialist government made 
profits by buying societe generale stock before the abortive 
takeover began and pushed up the price 
we are demanding to know the truth alain juppe secretary 
general of chiracs rally for the republic party said thursday 
juppe called for a vigorous investigation of both affairs with the 
results then made public 
public investigations are extremely rare in french political or 
financial scandals which often fade away inconclusively without 
clear answers to questions posed in press commentaries

some of americas shrewdest most successful 
marketers of products and services are called naive in a new 
corporate listing they are accused of financing their enemies and 
eventually their own destruction 
they misgive they support organizations that are boring 
holes in the hull of free enterprise by acquiescing says a preface 
to the report business leaders are as culpable as those who mean to 
destroy the system 
in short they give lots of money to leftleaning groups 
advocating policies hostile to corporate interests says the 
capital research center a private washingtonbased group that 
monitors corporate giving 
leading the list are dayton hudson cocacola general mills 
pillsbury chemical bank aetna life amp casualty atlantic richfield 
atampt jp morgan and citicorp 
the listings are contained in patterns of corporate 
philanthropy written by roger e meiners and david n laband 
clemson university professors with a preface by former treasury 
secretary william e simon 
the trend is not new the center having documented it in a 
similar volume last year by marvin olasky of the university of 
texas who found that 7 of every 10 given by some companies was 
for causes deemed inimical to their interests 
and says simon it existed for at least two decades before 
that 
the book examines the publicaffairs giving of the top 250 
companies as compiled by forbes magazine recipient organizations 
were categorized under such labels as radical left or left 
liberal or liberal center left 
groups with philosopical ratings of radical left were said to 
favor a national restructuring along generally socialist lines and 
to embody a a national security and foreign policy perspective 
that generally reflects the aims and interest of the third world 
and communist bloc 
few groups rated a radical left label in the domestic policy 
area the center for community change was listed named in arms 
control and foreign policy and in domestic policy was the 
institute for policy studies also included was the american friends 
service committee 
groups labeled left tending to favor accommodation with 
antiamerican communist and third world leaders in foreign policy 
and government action at the expense of free market and private 
voluntarisim include jesse jacksons operation push the peace 
child foundation and feminist press 
the liberal category was defined as establishment organizations 
that advocate policies that lean toward a major activist role for 
government in economic and social welfare rpograms and greater trust 
in a detenteoriented appraoch to the soviet union and the communist 
bloc generally 
included in the liberal catgory was the brookings institution a 
wellknown washington think tank with a tradition of involvement and 
influence in federal policy and the national planning association 
it isnt surprising that big business would try to buy off 
some of its most outspoken critics said willa anne johnson 
president of the center unfortunately it doesnt work 
she contended that many groups call themselves civil rights 
organizations but a careful review of their activities shows 
contempt and sometimes open hostility toward the american 
enterprise system which makes progress possible 
the ten companies named and many others like them she said 
are at the very least naive in their giving 
the study showed that more than twothirds of the grants made by 
the forbes 250 companies went to liberal organizations and such 
organizations received 585 percent of the grant dollars compared 
with 36 percent donated to the more conservative groups 
said simon a wealthy businessman investor and president of the 
john m olin foundation 
what is going on is that leaders of the american free 
enterprise system or people acting in their name and with corporate 
profits are financing the destruction of their own system and 
ultimately of our free society

nico wegter a community spokesman said the foreign ministers 
will be asked to implement as soon as possible countermeasures that 
would slap stiff duties on american imports of dried fruit and 
walnuts he package was tentatively approved earlier this month by 
the governments representatives in brussels 
but other officials said a number of countries apparently want to 
defer setting an effective date in order to give the two sides more 
time to resolve the dispute particularly with george bush taking 
office as the new us president 
many countries said one official want to see if theres still 
a possibility of getting the new administration moving 
the officials who demanded anonymity said the ministers may 
also want to await the outcome of a feb 8 meeting of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the eec intends to ask the 96nation 
gatt to declare the us retaliatory measures in violation of the 
international bodys rules 
moreover officials have been following reports that some small 
us slaughterhouses and packaging firms have offered to ship 
untreated meat to europe it is an encouraging sign and should be 
explored to see how far this can go said an official 
as a result the officials said it was likely the foreign 
ministers would decide to continue watching the situation and 
discuss it again in february or march 
the dispute was touched off by an eec decision to prohibit for 
health reasons meat from animals treated with growth hormones the 
united states which exports about 100 million of such meat to the 
eec annually contends the use of certain hormones to fatten 
animals a common practice among american farmers does not pose a 
health risk 
the united states has urged the europeans to let gatts committee 
on technical barriers to trade also known as the standards code 
committee decide the issue on scientific grounds 
the eec has insisted that gatt should consider only whether the 
community has the right to impose such a ban to protect the health 
of its consumers 
but there was some hint the community was shifting its position 
frans andriessen the eecs top trading official told the 
european parliament the communitys legislative body on thursday 
that scientific factors could be considered 
one doesnt need to exclude the scientific judgment in the 
total framework of this problem he said 
wegter denied that andriessens remarks represented a shift but 
other officials saw the comments as marking a weakening of the 
european position 
the meat ban was to have taken effect jan 1 1988 but the 
trading bloc agreed to a oneyear delay the eec refused further 
us appeals for a postponement 
in retaliation the united states imposed 100 percent duties on 
boneless beef pork hams and shoulders and a variety of other 
european products the sanctions are worth about 100 million 
both sides agreed to allow a grace period until the end of 
january for sanctioned products to enter their borders this applies 
to goods in transit before jan 1 
the disputed goods represent a tiny fraction of the estimated 
166 billion in trade last year between the united states and the 
common market

after 32 years about 70 retired mississippi 
gulf coast fishermen have reeled in a nice retirement catch about 
1400 each as they disbanded their union 
the fishermen who hadnt met as members of the old gulf coast 
shrimpers and oystermen association in 32 years voted in chancery 
court in biloxi this week to dissolve their organization 
there are not enough old men here left to reorganize the 
union and certainly not enough to go fishing temporary union 
chairman carlyle able told the gathering 
members responded by voting unanimously to dissolve the 
association and divvy up an estimated 135000 in union funds 
chancery judge william stewart called the fishermen to the 
harrison county courthouse thursday and ordered them to decide if 
they wanted to dissolve the association and collect their share of 
the money 
the money has remained in coast banks since 1957 the year of the 
last union meeting in which dues were collected 
in meetings in the 1940s and 1950s there were often arguments 
and fistfights among union members members said as many as 4000 
fishermen from the coast were part of the association 
thursdays meeting was marked with some dissension but not a 
ruckus 
after court officials found a courtroom that could accommodate 
the 200 fishermen and family members stewart warned those in 
attendance to keep the meeting orderly 
right now court is in session stewart said this is not 
outside on the streets 
this is in a courtroom he said there is only one way to 
have a meeting and that is to be quiet 
biloxi fisherman henry l wescovich asked stewart to decide late 
last year what to do about the union and its money a key 
consideration in the case was whether the union still existed or if 
it became defunct in 1957 
the unions bylaws state that only those members living and in 
good standing could share in the funds if the union still existed 
had the union been dissolved in 1957 heirs of the members might 
have had a claim to the 135000 
union members quit meeting regularly after the association was 
found in violation of the sherman anittrust act in 1955 union 
members said 
but stewart ruled last month that the union still existed because 
it never officially was dissolved he listed about 700 fishermen who 
were considered members in good standing or who were paid up in 
union dues 
on thursday three union members were appointed to dole out the 
money to surviving members lawyers estimate as many as 90 union 
members may still be alive although only about 70 were in court 
thursday 
some fishermen argued that they were unjustly left off the 
membership list

the court of appeal on friday rejected lonrho plcs 
attempt to force an investigation of the 1985 takeover of house of 
fraser plc the owner of harrods department store by the alfayed 
brothers of egypt 
lonrho said it will now put the case before the house of lords 
the highest appeals court in britain 
the original sunday deadline for a decision on a referral to the 
monopolies and mergers commission for investigation of the takeover 
was extended pending a house of lords ruling 
the commission is the only body that could order the 
unprecedented reversal of the alfayeds 11 billion takeover of 
the 100store retailing group 
the reversal is sought by roland w tiny rowland the chief 
executive of lonrho the farflung british conglomerate with 
holdings that range from the observer newspaper to extensive 
interests in africa 
trade secretary lord young has refused to refer the matter to the 
commission for investigation 
the appeal court verdict reversed a high court ruling tuesday 
ordering young to refer the matter to the commission and to 
reconsider his refusal to publish a government inquiry into the 
takeover 
lonrho has fought a prolonged campaign to undo the alfayed 
takeover after its own effort to buy house of fraser was blocked by 
the commission in 1981 the government subsequently allowed the 
alfayeds to buy the group without facing a commission inquiry 
however the government later decided to launch an inquiry into 
the takeover official inspectors completed a 15month review of the 
takeover last summer that uncovered asyet undisclosed new facts 
but lord young decided in september not to refer the alfayed 
purchase to the commission prompting lonrho to launch a court 
action to reverse youngs decision he also refused to publish the 
inspectors report saying it might prejudice investigations by the 
serious fraud office which is also looking into the takeover 
the appeals court said it would give the reasoning behind its 
judgment on monday

the nations no 2 maker of big highway 
buses rapidly weakening a few years ago has recharged and now 
enjoys orders from clients that range from mass transit operators to 
touring popmusic stars 
eagle bus manufacturing inc began its smooth financial ride when 
it became a subsidiary of greyhound lines inc the company that 
carries the most people between us cities by bus 
we actually shut this place down three times because of lack of 
orders in 1987 said vern tull executive vice president and head 
of sales for brownsvillebased eagle 
eagles revival came four months after an investor group headed 
by dallas entrepreneur fred currey in march 1987 bought operating 
assets of greyhound lines inc from its parent company the phoenix 
arizbased greyhound corp 
in july 1987 curreys group acquired selected assets of 
competitor trailways lines inc including trailways 
brownsvillebased busmanufacturing subsidiary eagle international 
inc 
eagle had traveled a downward curve with its sluggish trailways 
parent for years potential eagle bus buyers shunned a product that 
appeared to verge on demise said george gravley greyhound lines 
spokesman in dallas 
trailways was the main user of the eagle bus so the feeling 
was that if trailways were to go out of business then there would 
be no eagle bus gravley said the day that we bought it it 
became a viable bus manufacturer potential customers had confidence 
that it was going to be around 
with greyhound lines backing eagles business multiplied from 
75 buses produced in 1987 to 300 in 1988 a 400 percent increase 
tull said eagles sales jumped from 20 million in 1987 to 70 
million for 1988 he said with the work force tripling to about 550 
while it may seem only natural that a bus maker would do well if 
owned by a resurgent passenger bus carrier a builtin customer 
company officials point out that only 50 of the eagles produced in 
1988 went to the parent company 
greyhound lines remains under contract to buy buses from its 
former parent company the greyhound corp which remains its 
largest competitor in the bus manufacturing business the greyhound 
corps subsidiaries produce twothirds of the intercity buses in 
north america 
while greyhound lines bought 50 eagles in 1988 it purchased 151 
buses from motor coach industries inc a subsidiary of the 
phoenixbased competition which still retains a 225 percent 
interest in greyhound lines 
under the 1987 deal in which currey former trailways chief 
executive officer and other investors formed the new greyhound 
lines in dallas the currey group is obligated to continue buying 
buses from the old parent company 
motor coach buses will remain the mainstay of the greyhound lines 
fleet which totaled 3904 at the end of the year gravley said 
the only eagles in the greyhound lines fleet are the 50 new ones 
the currey group bought and about 450 acquired in the trailways deal 
eagles business plan projects th company making 400 buses in 
1989 with no orders yet from the parent company 
still tull said the 50bus order from greyhound lines was 
eagles most important order 
it put out a notice that he currey believes in eagle and that 
they intend to support eagle and it really put a breath of life 
into this company tull said 
eagle was the basic trailways bus often ridiculed by greyhound 
drivers but qualitycontrol problems have disappeared with the new 
ownership tull said 
major new orders at eagle bus since july 1987 include 99 for the 
houston metropolitan transit authority 20 shipped to egypt and 119 
for new jersey transit 
but eagle president john blondek said the small orders will keep 
the company going blondeks aggressive sales approach and frequent 
contacts with customers have won praise since he joined eagle late 
in 1987 
our business will thrive only if we tend the store with the 
really important orders and thats the onesies and twosies said 
blondek 
the eagles come in three sizes 35 feet with 41 seats 40 feet 
with 47 seats and 45 feet with 57 seats average cost is 195000 
many entertainers have ordered custom eagle coaches for touring 
including willie nelson randy travis and the pointer sisters tull 
said because the suspension makes it easy to sleep on the road 
youre not a star unless you have a gold record and an eagle 
he said 
greyhound lines attention to the market has caused a small 
revival in the business of hauling people from point to point by 
bus tull said so thats really helped us a lot our whole 
customer base is on the upswing 
greyhound trailways and bus manufacturers languished earlier in 
the decade from a combination of upstart competition that 
accompanied deregulation of the industry escalating insurance 
costs cheaper airfares and dropping oil prices that made car travel 
cheaper 
miamibased travel industry consultant jim cammisa said the hard 
times for the passenger bus industry appear over partly due to the 
new greyhound lines management and higher airfares

the nations home builders on friday forecast a 
74 percent decline in housing starts and a 5 percent drop in new 
home sales this year continuing a threeyear decline 
the forecast by the national association of home builders came a 
day after the commerce department reported 1988 housing starts of 
149 million an 82 percent decrease from 1987s 162 million 
despite the decline nahb economist david seiders said housing 
starts will remain above a million at an estimated 138 million 
frankly thats not a bad year he said 
seiders and other economists appearing friday at the nahbs 
annual meeting in atlanta said they expected the federal reserve 
board the nations central bank to maintain a tight rein on 
credit causing interest rates to rise early in the year to restrain 
inflationary pressures 
the economy is destined to slow down in 1989 it has to said 
seiders although he added it would take a policy mistake to 
bring about a recession 
the popularity of adjustable rate mortgages since the last round 
of rising interest rates also presents a new problem the economists 
said 
lynn michaelis the chief economist for the forest products firm 
weyerhaeuser co said mortgage holders could find themselves paying 
as much as 10 billion more in house payments as increasing rates 
are reflected in their loans 
most people have had a positive experience with arms he 
said but now will face higher payments 
richard pratt chairman of merrill lynch mortgage capital 
admitted the phenomenon may cause delinquency rates to increase but 
said the overall impact is unclear 
the economists estimated that arms account for about 500 billion 
of the total 2 trillion mortgage debt 
while some regions of the country have been especially hard hit 
by housing declines seiders said 1989 will see an eveningout of 
the differences 
for example the oil patch region of arkansas louisiana 
oklahoma and texas had a 211 percent drop in housing starts last 
year he said by far the steepest decline of any region 
the same area should have only a 67 percent drop this year he 
said 
while housing starts are going down house prices will rise 
seiders said but at a slower pace than during the three previous 
years 
price appreciation will be slowest in the northeast he said 
as demand catches up with construction prices will rise most 
rapidly on the west coast he said 
seiders also foresees a time when a house is again a good 
investment 
house price appreciation will exceed the overall rate of 
inflation in the economy during the early 1990s he said 
acceleration in new home prices will be relatively large because 
of the growing importance of tradeup buyers 
the nahb says almost twothirds of all new homes built are 
intended as tradeup homes with a full array of amenities 
firsttime buying remains strong with about 85 million young 
families expected to purchase their first home in the next four 
years the organization said 
however the industrys figures show a decline in the percentage 
of young people who own their home 
it said 359 percent of young adults aged 25 to 29 owned homes in 
the third quarter of 1988 down from a high of 44 percent in 1979

whirlpool corp said friday a poor 
showing by its kitchen cabinet business and expected losses from 
selling the business contributed to a 12 million fourthquarter 
loss and a 51 percent drop in earnings for all of 1988 
but the appliance maker posted sales gains of 38 percent for the 
quarter and 49 percent for the year despite declining sales 
industrywide capturing greater market shares in most product 
categories whirlpool chairman david r whitwam said 
whirlpool became the worlds largest appliance concern with an 
agreement earlier this month to purchase a majority of nv philips 
appliance division 
the net loss of 12 million or 17 cents a share reported for 
the three months ended dec 31 compared with net earnings of 404 
million or 59 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1987 the 
company said 
whirlpool reported fourthquarter net sales of 994 million up 
from 958 million in the comparable period a year earlier 
for the year whirlpool reported net earnings of 941 million 
or 136 a share on net sales of 431 billion compared with 
1919 million or 268 a share on net sales of 411 billion in 
1987 
the major factor in the fourthquarter loss and the drop in 1988 
earnings was a loss of 529 million relating to the whirlpool 
kitchens inc subsidiary the company said 
whirlpool announced earlier this month it had agreed to sell the 
business to a private investment partnership for an undisclosed 
amount 
the 529 million included the units 1988 operating losses and a 
45 million provision for the estimated loss connected with 
disposing of the business the company said 
whirlpool also reported costs of 20 cents a share for 1988 due to 
warranty charges in connection with a product sold by its former 
heilquaker corp subsidiary 
the heating and coolingsystem maker was sold in 1986 to 
intercity gas corp in canada whirlpool agreed to pay future 
warranty costs in connection with an undisclosed heilquaker 
product whirlpool spokesman dale f sorget said 
also cutting into whirlpools 1988 earnings were materials costs 
that rose faster than its appliance prices higher interest 
expenses and weaker results from brazilian appliancemaking and 
compressormanufacturing affiliates the company said 
this year will be tough for appliance makers whitwam said 
we expect the highly competitive environment of the us major 
appliance industry to persist through 1989 with sales of the nine 
major appliances to dealers dropping approximately 4 percent to 6 
percent compared to 1988 he said 
but he noted the jan 2 consummation of an agreement to acquire a

cocoa settled 77 to 94 higher with the contract for delivery in 
march at 1461 a metric ton a metric ton is 2205 pounds

lynch capital markets inc in new york 
i emphasize my own skepticism echoed analyst arthur 
stevenson of prudentialbache securities inc in new york but 
nevertheless thats one of the things we heard

prices rocketed through successive levels of resistance

the international cocoa organization the cocoa cartel is seeking a 
means for stabilizing prices which have been in a downward trend 
because of a glut of cocoa following four years of excess production

bond prices were mostly lower in light trading 
friday declining along with the dollar 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell 716 point or about 
440 per 1000 face amount while its yield which moves in the 
opposite direction from its price rose to 888 percent from 884 
percent late thursday 
kathleen stephansen a vice president and senior economist at 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp said the lower prices 
on treasury issues were a reaction to the dollars decline 
the dollar fell for a second day as central banks again 
intervened selling the currency in an effort to lower its price 
a weak dollar usually hurts bond prices because it makes 
dollardenominated securities less attractive to foreigners and 
produces inflation fears by making imports more expensive 
james l kochan chief fixedincome strategist at merrill lynch amp 
co said he doubted that even the dollar had an impact on bond 
trading friday 
drifting is probably the word to use he said of the days 
trading and when markets drift they generally drift lower 
he said it was one of those days where there were no economic 
indicators released nothing for people to focus upon a feeling 
that the rally has taken the bond market to fairly high levels and 
that clients really dont have much to do except to see if were 
going to rally further 
traders said president bushs inaugural address in which he 
discussed the federal deficit but gave no specific plans for 
reducing it appeared to have little impact on bond prices 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell by between 332 point and 316 point intermediate 
maturities fell 316 point to 732 point and longterm issues were 
down from 516 point to 716 point according to telerate inc the 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 223 to 113698 
in corporate trading industrials were down slightly moodys 
investment grade corporate bond index which measures price 
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer fell 019 to 29811 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds was down 332 point at 92 1132 the average 
yield to maturity rose to 766 percent 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 852 percent as the 
discount rose 4 basis points to 824 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 875 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 
828 yields on oneyear bills rose to 891 percent as the discount 
rose 4 basis points to 825 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at 8 percent down from 9 percent late thursday

mexico is sending its ustrained champion of 
international finance to washington this weekend to convince 
creditors to give his country a break from its crushing foreign debt 
under pressure from time and heavy social needs new president 
carlos salinas de gortari hopes for an agreement in two or three 
months he says mexico needs the money to invest in growth which he 
hopes will reach a 4 percent rate starting next year 
mexican officials dont even want to think about the alternative 
in a country where a high birth rate in the 1960s is now visible in 
the yearly wave of 1 million new workers entering too small a labor 
market 
mexicos leader in international finance is finance minister 
pedro aspe armella a 39yearold phd trained at the massachusetts 
institute of technology in cambridge mass the school is known for 
its work in economics 
aspe recently told us financiers they can trust mexican 
economists because they are the best 
most of us graduated from your schools said the cabinet 
secretary who has a quick smile and graying hair 
aspe said mexico owes 103 billion 40 percent of it to us 
banks 
to keep up payments mexico has been losing the equivalent of 
nearly 6 percent of its gross national product annually debt 
service which equals interest and principal last year came to 13 
billion 
earlier this month aspe met with us officials including 
treasury secretary nicholas brady 
in those discussions aspe dramatized mexicos plight saying 
germanys world war i reparations led to hyperinflation and the rise 
of adolf hitler according to a source at the meeting who spoke on 
condition of anonymity aspe reportedly said germany was paying only 
4 percent of its gross national product annually for reparations 
unless mexicos total transfer of funds abroad is reduced to 
about 2 percent of the gross national product mexico will not be 
able to renew economic growth and will face severe economic and 
social problems government officials say one mexican official put 
it this way dead clients pay no debts 
aspe traveling to washington on sunday two days after george 
bush takes office as president will lead complicated negotiations 
involving the united states other governments and hundreds of 
banks 
he is expected again to outline salinas position mexico is 
doing its best to pay and deserves good treatment from creditors 
including new credit if needed 
us secretary of statedesignate james a baker has promised a 
review of latin american debt problems but has said he does not have 
a magic wand to solve the problem 
mexico has avoided talk of suspending payments 
we need creativity and imagination said a government source 
speaking on condition of anonymity we would like multiannual 
agreements that would assure us of a steady flow of capital for 
several years instead of annual negotiations for new funds 
there are those who feel we will never get out of this hole 
there are options in debt discounts one official said 
in the past six years mexico has reshaped its internal economic 
policies towards a freer market something baker has called on other 
debtor nations to do it has cut public spending reduced tariffs to 
force its manufacturers to compete with imports pushed through new 
tax laws to broaden the tax base and won labor and business 
commitments to keep prices down 
in a dramatic move to show he means to modernize mexico salinas 
jailed the leadership of the oil workers union whose power has 
kept the government from reforming its oil monopoly pemex 
but theres a limit to the sacrifices mexico is willing to make 
and salinas wants cooperation of creditors who refuse to recognize 
they made bad loans one mexican official said he was referring 
to loans made during the 1970s oil boom that buoyed mexico until 
prices collapsed

the philadelphia stock exchange conjured up a 
snowball fight friday where there hasnt been snow for nearly three 
weeks then conjured up business at an unheardof hour 
exchange president nicholas giordano rang the bell at 430 am 
to open trading in foreign currency options launching an effort to 
cater to european customers wanting a start better suited to their 
business day 
im exhausted dennis smith vice president of flynn 
optionshurricane trading said at the end of the day but he said 
the early start was a good move 
i have a lot to gain out of it if we do a lot of business with 
the europeans he said 
in the expanded hours 3 hours longer than with the old 8 am 
start the exchange reported 40020 contracts compared with the 
december average of 32605 
the exchange introduced the new starting time to let currency 
trading coincide with morning hours in europe when giordano rang 
the bell the paris clock on the wall read 1030 am and the london 
clock 930 am 
the feeling is if you can make the hours more conducive to the 
business day in europe more business will emanate from the 
philadelphia exchange said barry tague president of tague 
securities the exchanges designated specialist firm in the 
deutsche mark and the japanese yen 
to get publicity for the new hours the exchange hosted a 4 am 
snowballthrowing contest outside the exchange no problem even in 
a city that last had snow jan 2 jack frost mountain ski area of 
lake harmony pa supplied the manmade ammunition 
the first throw missed five currency symbols set up under 
floodlights as targets on the street but soon the us dollar 
symbol and the british pound fell and within 15 minutes 
participants were choosing each other as targets instead 
likewise things began moving quickly on the trading floor where 
about 100 people were at work compared with the usual daytime 
150200 
within five minutes a furious auction erupted at one end of the 
room and drexel burnham lambert inc quickly executed an order for 
650 contracts in west german mark options 
its important because its important to europe arnold 
staloff president of the philadelphia board of trade said of the 
early opening europe has been asking us to do this 
europeans want the philadelphia market he said because its 
the only viable listed market on currency options in the world 
the new hours are 430 am to 230 pm and 6 pm to 10 pm 
the latter trading period began in september 1987 to cover the 
japanese morning hours 
well make money certainly smith said the biggest concern 
here with everybody is will the volume done from 430 am to 8 
am translate into new volume or will it be what we would have 
done from 8 to 10 am anyway 
were hoping obviously that it doesnt do the latter

texas eastern corp the target of a 26 billion 
hostile takeover bid by the coastal corp was granted a motion 
friday by a federal appeals court that allows the company to pursue 
legal action in other courts 
earlier this week us district judge lynn n hughes granted a 
preliminary injunction prohibiting texas eastern from initiating 
litigation in another court without permission from the judge 
hughes ruling came after coastal and two texas eastern 
stockholders filed suits seeking an injunction to keep texas eastern 
from activating a poison pill defense to stop the tender offer 
with a poison pill plan a company typically gives its 
shareholders the right to buy additional stock at a steep discount 
once an unwelcome suitor buys a certain percentage of the companys 
shares it raises the costs of an uninvited takeover offer hughes 
consolidated the suits and set a hearing for feb 6 
but on friday the 5th us circuit court of appeals in new 
orleans granted texas easterns motion requesting a stay of hughes 
preliminary injunction 
texas eastern then filed a lawsuit against coastal and colorado 
interstate corp coastals wholly owned subsidiary in a chancery 
court in delaware the suit asks the court to rule that texas 
easterns poison pill plan is lawful the plan was adopted in 1986 
by the companys board of directors 
texas eastern spokesman fred wichlep said friday that no action 
has been taken yet on the suit he did not know if the delaware 
court would act on the issue before hughes planned hearing 
meanwhile texas easterns board and coastal executives plan to 
meet sunday to discuss coastals offer it will be the first 
facetoface meeting between officials from the two companies since 
coastal announced its 42ashare bid for all texas eastern common 
stock monday the offer is set to expire feb 13 
if houstonbased coastals bid is successful the consolidated 
natural gas pipeline network would be the nations largest in the 
volume of gas transported 
coastal spokesman bob wells said friday called texas easterns 
action an attempt to delay the takeover attempt in the courts wells 
said a takeover probably cannot be fully completed until the issue 
of the posion pill plan is finally resolved by the courts 
but wichlep said texas eastern was not trying to delay anything 
texas eastern had filed the suit in delaware because both it and 
coastal are incorporated there and because texas easterns purchase 
rights plan is governed by delaware law he said

the board of directors of holly farms corp 
on friday rejected a sweetened 115 billion buyout offer from rival 
poultry producer tyson foods inc but invited tyson and conagra 
inc to continue bidding for the firm 
in a statement holly farms acknowledged that tysons 
6350ashare cash bid topped conagras offer to buy the company in 
a stock swap valued at 1 billion 
however holly farms said its board had doubts that tyson could 
in fact pay 6350 a share for the firm 
holly farms said tyson had been unwilling to provide the board 
with appropriate assurances that holly farms stockholders would in 
fact have received 6350 and not some lesser amount 
the directors also were not certain that tyson would be able to 
close the deal because of litigation resulting from holly farms 
proposed merger with conagra 
holly farms agreed to be acquired by conagra in november as it 
tried to fend off tyson the merger has been blocked by a delaware 
state court in response to a petition by tyson which argued that 
holly farms was not acting in the best interest of its shareholders 
in agreeing to the combination with conagra 
conagra is appealing the decision 
tyson also objected to a provision of the proposed merger known 
as a lockup agreement that would have allowed conagra to buy 
major parts of holly farms if their merger fell through
