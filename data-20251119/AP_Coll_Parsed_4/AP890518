president francois mitterrand wary of getting 
caught up in the divisive nato debate over modernization of 
shortrange nuclear missiles said thursday the allies still have 
time to think about it 
speaking at a news conference at the presidential palace 
mitterrand stressed that though france was a loyal member of the 
nato it was not apart of the alliances integrated military 
command from which president charles de gaulle withdrew in 1966 
as such he said france is not directly concerned in the 
missile debate 
however he noted he was satisfied that us and german 
officials seem to have decided that if there is to be 
modernization there is time to discuss it between now and 1992 
this date being the point after which there would be aging and 
thus imbalance 
he said the north atlantic treaty organization summit in 
brussels later this month would be discussing the issue which he 
would talk about with president bush this weekend in kennebunkport 
maine 
the west german government has asked the united states to start 
talks with the soviet union on eliminating shortrange nuclear 
weapons the united states had said it had no plans to do so 
mitterrand said the allies must be able to verify the real state 
of the soviet unions modernized forces adding all modernization 
on on side would lead automatically to a modernization on the 
other 
the president said he would be willing to eliminate frances 
nuclear arsenal if the united states and the soviet union renounce 
theirs 
france also is going ahead with modernization of its own 
shortrange nuclear missiles which the president said were neither 
theater nor tactical weapons but only a weapon of ultimate 
warning

shoes shiny as mirrors white teeth framed in 
sincere smiles and fingers groping for buttonholes members of the 
american league of lobbyists gathered to practice their 
breadandbutter art of schmoozing 
lobbyists seem to be everywhere in washington trying to 
influence legislators or government policymakers to give their 
clients a break its a tough job especially if the client is 
unsavory or his cause unpopular often success depends on knowing 
whose name to drop which elbow to squeeze 
it also can be highly lucrative we dont starve said 
public relations executive marc l apter whose diverse clients 
include state farm insurance and the west african nation of togo 
apter was lobbying the lobbyists for business thursday when more 
than 100 members of the league representing specialinterest 
groups from mobil oil corp to the national rural electric 
cooperative association to girl scouts of the usa held their 
annual conference here 
they dutifully attended lobbying workshops on taxes labor 
unions the environment foreign trade and medicare but they 
seemed happiest when they were schmoozing over cocktails and lunch 
its such idle chatter that sometimes yields valuable tips and 
contacts in washingtons network of influence salesmen 
among these garrulous birds the usual plumage seems to be dark 
blue suit white shirt and red or yellow power tie hair is 
trimmed tidily short laughter is boisterous but when the talk 
turns serious lobbyists crouch forward from the waist and stare in 
each others eyes 
their hands flutter in the air jingle pocket change brush 
foreheads clamp onto hips yank at noses with hardly a break in 
the chatter or a sideways glance they extract business cards from 
coats or wallets already bulging with other peoples business 
cards to exchange for yet another 
what makes a good lobbyist 
eugene f rowan has been one for 15 years he was jc penneys 
vice president for federal government relations until he retired a 
few years ago to become a freelance lobbyist using an office in 
the washington law firm of patton boggs amp blow his biggest client 
is the national association of chain drug stores whose president 
is former nixon white house press secretary ronald ziegler 
first of all youve got to have credibility your word must 
be something that a member of congress can rely on you cant 
misrepresent anything rowan said 
its crucial that you know your subject matter and you have 
to be able to live and deal with the culture of capitol hill most 
of the time you dont control the agenda or the timetable which 
frustrates a lot of business executives availability is important 
you only see sen sorghum when he wants to see you 
you have to be a good salesperson really you try to make eye 
contact and keep it its important to be natural no poses or 
roleplaying or backslapping they are very good at seeing through 
that kind of thing 
rowan deftly snatched a business card from his overstuffed 
wallet theres nothing worse than being caught on the hill 
without a card he said 
in a room full of conservative neckties rowan was the only 
lobbyist who wore a bow tie 
was this part of his shtick 
no he replied i cant spill gravy on this tie

polling places across the nation would close 
at 10 pm est in presidential elections under a plan approved by a 
senate panel in a move to prevent networks from announcing 
projected results before all ballots are cast 
the bill was part of a package that cleared the senate rules and 
administration committee on wednesday with chairman wendell ford 
dky saying it would make a much needed change in our federal 
election system 
other bills in the package would replace the current 
presidential primary system with eight regional primaries and make 
it illegal for lawmakers to pocket leftover campaign funds 
lawmakers elected in this decade already are barred from 
converting campaign funds to their personal use an exemption for 
those who came to capitol hill before 1980 would be abolished under 
the senate legislation 
committee action on the pollclosing bill sets the stage for a 
possible clash with the house which already has passed a rival 
version 
under the senate bill polls nationwide except in alaska and 
hawaii would close at 10 pm est that proposal is preferred by 
transportation companies which say it would leave their schedules 
intact 
under the house bill daylightsaving time would be extended in 
the pacific time zone long enough to take in the presidential 
election the legislation sponsored by rep al swift dwash 
would set pollclosing times at 9 pm est 8 pm cst 7 pm mst 
and 7 pm pdt 
airlines have been lobbying against the house proposal saying 
it would force them to skew their timetables in a variety of ways 
democratic sens brock adams of washington and donald w riegle 
jr of michigan are cosponsors of the senate version 
the 1980 presidential election put the spotlight on the issue of 
poll closings when networks called ronald reagan as the winner over 
jimmy carter while voters in many states still were on their way to 
vote 
politicians still debate whether thenrep al ullman dore 
chairman of the house ways and means committee lost his bid for 
reelection because the early projections discouraged many oregon 
democrats from voting 
in any case many americans were infuriated and felt the early 
projections made their votes seem futile according to sponsors of 
the legislation 
i believe early projections before the polls close threaten 
the right of some voters to go to the polls and feel their votes 
count adams said 
network projections are based on polls of voters as they leave 
the polling places rather than on the official vote count but such 
exit polls have been shown to be highly accurate 
networks have agreed to refrain from projecting the winner in 
any state until the polls close in that state that pledge 
however leaves the door open for networks to forecast the next 
occupant of the white house with millions of americans still to 
vote 
the regional primary bill is aimed at diminishing what critics 
call the lopsided influence on the nomination process of iowas 
early caucuses and new hampshires early primary 
nothing similar is moving in the house and calls for a regional 
primary system have been sparse lately 
sen mitch mcconnell rky told lawmakers he was voting 
against the bill because it would turn the presidential campaign 
into purely a television advertising event and take away caucuses 
and other remnants of the politics of the past which i would hate 
to see go 
the bill sponsored by sen alan j dixon dill would divide 
the nation into eight regions the first of which would have its 
presidential primary on the first tuesday of march the rest would 
hold their primaries every other tuesday thereafter 
the federal election commission would determine the order of the 
primaries by lot and no region would be able to go first in two 
successive elections the regions would be composed as follows 
region 1 maine new hampshire vermont new york 
massachusetts rhode island and connecticut region 2 ohio 
pennsylvania new jersey delaware region 3 kentucky tennessee 
south carolina north carolina virginia west virginia the 
district of columbia and maryland 
region 4 arkansas louisiana mississippi alabama georgia 
florida the virgin islands and puerto rico region 5 wisconsin 
michigan illinois indiana and missouri region 6 texas 
oklahoma kansas nebraska iowa south dakota north dakota and

within weeks scientists at the national 
institutes for health expect to begin splicing genes from a 
bacteria into the cells of dying cancer patients in hopes of 
developing a new therapy for fighting the disease 
the experiment until now conducted only with a few species of 
plants and animals will break new ground for science as the first 
authorized human gene transplant 
but it will mark only a first step toward equipping cells with 
cancerfighting genes 
were going full speed ahead said steven a rosenberg one 
of three nih researchers who have been preparing for more than a 
year for the experiment we have not yet transferred the cells 
into any patient but we expect to do that within the next several 
weeks 
the experiment was approved last january by the institutes 
recombinant dna advisory committee but at the same time a lawsuit 
was filed by the foundation on economic trends and its president 
jeremy rifkin 
the suit was settled tuesday with an nih advisory committee 
agreeing to keep its deliberations and votes on human gene research 
open to the public 
researchers said the litigation did not hold up their work 
rather the scientists said they have moved more slowly than 
expected because of technical factors related to setting up the 
complex experiment including finding appropriate patients and 
conducting an array of safety tests 
this is the very first time this is being done and we wanted 
to make sure everything was absolutely ideal because these patients 
are going to be under the microscope of a lot of people so weve 
taken longer than initially anticipated said r michael blaese 
one of the researchers 
he added weve been very close for some time 
rosenberg blaese and w french anderson will conduct the 
experiment with 10 patients who have advanced melanoma a deadly 
skin cancer and a life expectancy of 90 days 
in earlier work rosenberg showed that a type of immune cell 
called tumor infiltrating lymphocyte or til can be used to fight 
cancer he removed til cells from a patients tumor grew them in 
large numbers in the laboratory and then reinserted them into the 
patient 
in 12 of 20 patients the technique was at least partially 
successful 
now the question is why it works in some people but not others 
and the researchers believe that if they can find that answer they 
can learn to design tils to be more effective 
in this experiment they will introduce a bacterial gene into 
the cells to mark them so their movement in the body can be 
monitored though the tils may benefit the patient the gene being 
transplanted will not attack the melanoma 
the procedure has very little risk to the patient blaese said 
the initial studies will introduce genes that help us traffic 
the cells and study their survival but subsequent studies already 
being done in the laboratory are designed to increase the 
anticancer effectiveness of the cells by putting in new genes 
rosenberg said in an interview wednesday the major significance 
of the studies to us now is in attempting to develop a better 
cancer therapy 
as a technique in general gene therapy offers an approach to 
disease treatment that is quite different from the current methods 
using drugs radiation or surgery he said 
it is changing the very fabric of the genetic material of the 
cells to give it new properties to combat disease or overcome 
defects that lead to disease he said

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
wednesday he wanted to reach an accommodation with west germany 
over nuclear missiles but insisted the weapons were an essential 
deterrent to soviet attack 
baker took the hardline stance as he awaited the arrival of 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg who was headed 
here from bonn for meetings with defense secretary dick cheney on 
thursday and baker on friday 
stoltenberg also will meet with brent scowcroft the national 
security assistant to president bush scowcroft has expressed 
concern about lowering natos nuclear capability 
baker indicated he did not intend to give ground and said he 
hoped the west german official would bring an evolving position 
from bonn 
the west german government supported by several of the nato 
allies is pushing for negotiations between the united states and 
the soviet union to reduce and possibly eliminate nuclear missiles 
on both sides with a range of up to 300 miles 
baker said the missiles have helped keep the peace with the 
soviet union for nearly 40 years and were essential as a deterrent 
to war 
we would like to find a way to bridge this gap baker said 
on a us governmentsponsored telecast to western europe but we 
want to find a way that is consistent with maintaining our resolve 
with maintaining our will with maintaining our strength with 
maintaining the strategy of flexible response which has provided 
europe with peace for 40 years 
west german chancellor helmut kohl telephoned president bush on 
tuesday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said although 
fitzwater gave no details of the call the new york times reported 
in its thursday editions that kohl indicated his government was 
willing to take a more flexible approach on the missile question 
the newspaper citing unidentified western diplomats said that 
under the new approach talks on shortrange missiles might not 
begin until significant progress was made in reducing conventional 
arms in europe where the soviet bloc has a large advantage 
the west german government also is resisting a joint 
usbritish effort to more than triple the range of lance missiles 
to just below 300 miles all us and soviet missiles with ranges 
between 300 and 3000 miles were banned under a 1987 treaty 
the usbuilt lances now can hit targets from about 75 miles 
most of the 88 launchers carrying about 700 singlewarhead 
missiles are based in west germany 
baker said he understood the west germans concern that their 
country might become a battlefield in a tactical nuclear war 
between east and west but he said the warsaw pact had a big edge 
in shortrange nuclear weapons and had been making them more potent 
nuclear weapons are part of a defensive strategy baker said 
of natos rocket arsenal we ought to move very very slowly 
before we abandon that strategy 
under questioning from west european correspondents baker did 
not predict a resolution of the rift with west germany before the 
summit meeting is held in brussels may 2930 bush will attend with 
the leaders of the 15 other nato governments 
baker said he hoped stoltenberg would bring some new approaches 
from bonn 
for the most part baker said well be listening to 
gerhard stoltenberg when he comes to washington to see what he has 
to say we are very interested in what we hope will be an evolving 
position by the west german government on this issue 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said were still discussing the matter we continue to hope that 
we could reach some kind of agreement before the nato summit but 
if not well discuss it there or later 
he added we dont want to speculate on what we might accept 
our position has always been first we should proceed with the 
conventional arms talks until we can achieve a parity and then 
well discuss or address the situation with regards to snf we are 
not prepared to go beyond that at this point

a dozen workers installing track in a subway 
tunnel were injured wednesday three of them seriously burned when 
a section of new rail touched the 600volt electrified third rail 
the transit authority said 
two of the burned workers were in critical but stable condition 
and the third was in serious condition said kathy mcgowan a 
spokeswoman for new york hospitalcornell burn center 
the other nine workers were treated at two hospitals and 
discharged 
the workers were installing a 26foot rail between two stations 
in brooklyn and had placed a protective rubber mat across the third 
rail 
apparently the rail they were installing somehow slit the mat 
and came in contact with the third rail said caren gardner a ta 
spokeswoman the mat was sent for testing to determine it was 
slashed she said 
it is standard operating practice not to shut off electricity to 
the third rail while crews are installing a single rail ms 
gardner said 
the transit authority will convene a board of inquiry on friday

a major foreign policy split within the bush 
administration over a tentative driftnet fishing agreement with 
japan spilled into public view wednesday before the senate commerce 
committee 
a state department official told the committee that the 
monitoring and enforcement agreement represented an important 
first step toward regulating the driftnet fishing fleets in the 
north pacific 
but a commerce department official said he thought the treaty 
was inadequate and contained too many unanswered questions 
japan along with south korea and taiwan faces possible trade 
sanctions on its fishery products imported into the united states 
if driftnet agreements arent signed by june 29 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher will have to decide whether 
the treaty with the japanese meets the requirements of the driftnet 
act passed by congress in 1987 or whether the administration should 
pursue trade sanctions 
lawmakers from washington state alaska and oregon have urged 
the administration to renegotiate the treaty while the northwest 
fishing industry and environmentalists have been highly critical of 
the agreement which covers only one year 
an estimated 700 to 1000 fishing vessels from japan south 
korea and taiwan use driftnets in the north pacific ostensibly to 
catch squid the monofilament smallmesh nets which can stretch 
more than 30 miles in length hang in the water snaring virtually 
any mammal bird or fish that come in contact with them 
on any given day the nets can cover more than 30000 miles of 
ocean 
us fishermen insist the driftnet fleets are intentionally 
catching salmon under the guise of harvesting squid salmon runs in 
alaska washington state and oregon have dropped sharply as a 
result of the illegal fishing they say 
environmentalists charge that driftnets kill thousands of 
porpoises seals seabirds and other marine life annually 
the treaty would provide for 32 observers to be placed aboard 
the 460 japanese vessels that use driftnets and increase from four 
to five the number of japanese patrol boats in the vast area where 
driftnet fishing is legal 
the japanese refused to participate in a pilot program proposed 
by the united states to track their vessel locations by satellite 
and indicated they were unilaterally expanding the legal driftnet 
fishing zone 120 miles north 
the legal zone was designed to keep the driftnet fleets well 
away from the traditional migration routes of north american salmon 
the driftnet agreement with japan represents an important 
first step in this process and we hope will be followed by the 
conclusion of driftnet monitoring and enforcement programs for the 
driftnet fisheries of korea and taiwan as well said richard 
smith a principal deputy assistant secretary at the state 
department 
if that happens the first body bag would carry the remains of 
the best monitoring agreement weve ever had said smith adding 
that while he was aware of the frustration and anger 
surrounding the driftnet issue the treaty was the path of 
cooperation 
state department sources who asked not to be named said 
disagreement exists within the department over whether the treaty 
should be signed to avoid a possible trade war or whether it was 
time to get tough with the japanese 
william evans a commerce department under secretary for oceans 
and atmosphere told the committee he was not satisfied with the 
treaty 
i believe it falls way short of the mark said evans

consultants who collected big fees for work 
connected to a federally subsidized housing program told a 
congressional panel the payments were justified as senators 
complained the program was riddled with improprieties 
former massachusetts sen edward brooke who received 183000 
for consulting work on two lowincome housing projects in 
massachusetts told a senate committee wednesday that he had no 
special pipeline into the department of housing and department to 
influence contract awards under the housing program 
brooke also said it was understandable that developers 
sought assistance in competing for financing under the moderate 
rehabilitation program which he said was underfunded 
brooke and three other consultants appeared wednesday before the 
banking committee it was the first time they had testified 
publicly since they were named in a highlycritical report by the 
department of housing and urban developments inspector general 
the report found the lowincome housing renovation program was 
poorly managed and its undocumented selection process was riddled 
with favoritism 
the document alleged developers and housing authorites seeking 
money for projects selected consultants who did little more for the 
unusually high fees than make a few phone calls or write to their 
former colleagues 
not only did i advise clients on hud policies and procedures 
but on state and local programs and tax and housing legislative 
changes affecting lowincome housing development and financing 
said brooke 
there were not only a few calls but dozens and dozens of calls 
over a period of four years he said 
brooke said he had no influence in the reagan 
administration and hadnt known any of the hud officials he dealt 
with before he met or spoke with them in connection with the two 
projects 
committee chairman donald riegle dmich called the consultant 
contracts a form of looting that demonstrated a disturbing 
pattern at hud 
i want to find out about every project that was done in the 
country i dont want just the tip of the iceberg said riegle 
calling for a review of all projects awarded contracts through the 
program during the 19841988 period covered by the inspector 
generals audit 
the inspector general said no evidence of criminal wrongdoing 
has been discovered in the audit but the report has been referred 
to the justice department for review 
housing secretary jack kemp last month suspended 1989 funding 
for the program following release of the inspector generals report 
and said tuesday that he would restart the program next month and 
issue new guidelines 
meanwhile sen daniel moynihan dny on wednesday introduced 
a bill that would establish regulations for a competitive award 
process give the housing secretary greater control over the use of 
lowincome housing tax credit and provide for annual updating of 
the handbook used by field offices that administer the program 
judith s siegel a rhode island developer who paid former 
interior secretary james watt 300000 as a consultant for a 
project in essex md complained that some of the information in 
the inspector generals report was misleading and presented 
out of context 
mr watt did not receive a consulting fee for merely making a 
few phone calls said siegel adding that the maryland project 
had been in the states pipeline two years before she hired 
watt 
siegel conceded that watt could drive the federal bureaucracy 
when it needed to be driven but said his fees were not paid 
with any federal state or local funds 
sen richard shelby called the developerconsultant arrangements 
a situation of bare unadulterated influencepeddling for which 
the taxpayers ultimately paid 
the alabama democrat also took great pains to ensure that he was 
not confused with a consultant of the same name who appeared before 
the panel and defended the fees that he received 
that richard shelby political director of the republican 
senatorial committee earned 442000 in fees as a consultant to a 
renovation project in dade county fla according to the inspector 
generals report 
another consultant fred bush who has been nominated by 
president bush as ambassador to luxembourg admitted he did not 
bring very much to the project in puerto rico for which he served 
as a consultant the consultant who was paid 195000 and still is 
due another 65000 is not related to the president

it was a grisly scene that seemed straight from 
the violent west but the location was the soviet city of gorky 
in the heart of the volga river port criminals with sawedoff 
shotguns murdered two policemen because they wanted their pistols 
shocked residents of the metropolis 250 miles east of moscow now 
are afraid to leave home at night or let their children stray from 
sight 
in gorky people are afraid to go out one newspaper 
reported even downtown streets become deserted in the 
evening another said 
for most soviets violent crime was once what they saw on tv 
reports about the united states or in imported films but no more 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and loosened controls have not 
only made soviets better informed about crime at home they have 
sparked a surge in lawlessness itself by the kremlin leaders own 
admission 
from the very outset we had to bear in mind that any 
extension of democracy and humanization of life should go in 
parallel with an uncompromising struggle against criminal 
elements gorbachev told communist party leaders last month 
but party and government bodies and also work collectives 
permitted a slackening of attention to those issues 
in the past week the soviet unions police blotter has included 
these spectacular crimes as reported by staterun media 
a police officer gone bad obtained entry to a bank in armenia 
and he and his confederates made off with the equivalent of about 
330000 after a cashier and three policemen died in a hail of 
bullets on learning of the corrupt policemans crime his mother 
committed suicide 
a criminal gang nicknamed the jackals terrorized the 
capital of kazakhstan alma ata the chief of criminal 
investigators in the central asian republic says he has never 
encountered such gruesome offenses in 30 years of police work the 
jackals reportedly befriended women then raped and strangled them 
in the siberian region of omsk two 20year army deserters go 
on a crime spree and battle with police firing at them with a 
submachine gun the outlaws are captured while asleep in a forest 
hideout 
for soviets accustomed to hearing that crime was a product of 
capitalist exploitation and would disappear under socialism such 
reports now possible under gorbachevs policy of greater openness 
are perplexing and frightening official statistics show the 
countrys crime problem is getting worse 
according to deputy interior minister n demidov crime 
nationwide was up a staggering 312 percent for the first four 
months of 1989 compared with the same period last year robberies 
skyrocketed by 867 percent and burglaries increased by more than 
twothirds demidov told the newspaper trud last week 
more soviets are now murdered every year by criminals than died 
during the entire nine years of kremlin involvement in the afghan 
war in which 15000 soldiers were killed trud said 
in 1986 20610 americans were murdered according to fbi 
statistics 
showing highlevel concern over the crime boom the soviet 
interior ministry which is in charge of police affairs has 
created a department to combat lawlessness by fighting its causes 
such as drug abuse drinking and parasitism the official tass news 
agency announced tuesday 
the same day a special party commission on legal matters 
headed by former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov acknowledged the 
state of public order in the country is deteriorating and the 
number of grave crimes is rising and it recommended better 
training for police more specialization for detectives and a 
single nationwide program for combatting crime 
firearms and offense committed with them are still far rarer in 
soviet society than in the united states but a poll published this 
week by the moscow news weekly indicates the fear of crime is as 
widespread among soviet city dwellers as their us counterparts 
in moscow 33 percent of those polled said they are afraid to 
venture out alone at night in the street where they live that was 
more than in three of the four us cities surveyed boston 
detroit and san francisco and was topped only by new yorks 38 
percent according to the survey conducted in part by the 
institute of sociology of the soviet academy of sciences 
one crime surge can be directly traced to gorbachevs reforms 
extortion the number of potential prey for racketeers has 
burgeoned since the government began promoting the spread of 
cooperatives a move that has put more money into private hands 
pravda the communist party daily reported cooperative workers 
were making guns and bombs right at work to protect themselves 
from shakedowns and said their cry had become im buying a 
gun 
in gorky a city of 15 million where the policemen were slain 
in february authorities settled on officially sponsored 
vigilantism as one way to fight a 75 percent increase in serious 
crime creating emergency commissions headed by local party 
chiefs and workers militias 
workers are sent by their factories to work with police for a 
year or more and the enterprises pay their normal salaries and 
even buy their police uniforms the daily sovietskaya rossiya 
reported 
yulian semenov a writer of thrillers who often has made cia 
agents his villains told the literary gazette weekly that speed is 
essential in fighting lawlessness 
if we go slowly the streets of moscow leningrad and other 
big cities soon will start to resemble new yorks not by the 
quantity of cars goods in the stores or choice of restaurants but 
by the number of criminals drug addicts and prostitutes the 
writer said

official media were silent when moslem 
guerrillas kept a column of gasoline trucks from reaching kabul 
recently but the currency traders knew about it and moved the 
dollar up against the afghani 
word came two days later that the army had reopened the road and 
the convoy had safely completed the 260mile journey from the 
soviet border the soberfaced men on the bank of the kabul river 
moved the dollar down again 
capitalism flourishes in kabul which was a crossroads for 
merchants and traders many centuries before it became a marxist 
capital 11 years ago 
the money market or serai shazad is conducted in the inner 
courtyard of a balconied building with rusting beams where camel 
trains once sojourned overnight 
traders in turbans count bundles of notes blue beige pink 
pausing occasionally to tend their goats or other animals grazing 
nearby it is no secret that the men who dominate the serai shazad 
are wealthy some of them millionaires many times over 
civil war which began with a communist coup in april 1978 has 
created periodic and sometimes critical shortages of food fuel and 
medicine 
for those with money however the duncolored city is a 
cornucopia 
merchants sell goods from wooden containers at roadsides in 
western kabul business is always brisk in rice flour wheat 
kerosene and other goods taken from supply convoys that do not make 
it through guerrillaheld territory 
the pocked streets and winding alleys of the old bazaar overflow 
with everything from expensive 100yearold carpets and mercedes 
automobiles to japanese videocassette recorders soviet combat 
uniforms and secondhand western jeans 
highways running north to the soviet border and east to pakistan 
are the citys lifeline and what moves on them sets the rhythm of 
the market 
helicopter gunships tanks rockets and artillery are some of 
the tools used to keep them open 
then come lulls in guerrilla activity when convoys rumble into 
kabul without interference juma mohammad a 38yearold money 
changer says some rebel commanders have their price 
ins really quite simple he said there is a road 
somebody controls the road somebody else wants to use the road and 
deals are made its strictly business 
information moves through the money bazaars grapevine as if it 
were an electronic data system and the afghani rises or falls as 
convoys reach kabul or are attacked 
pounds marks francs and nearly all other currencies are traded 
but the dollar is supreme 
dollars sometimes tens of thousands are stacked neatly in 
chipped cabinets in the traders tiny offices on the balconies 
overlooking the trading floor which is dusty or muddy 
depending on the weather 
as mohammad discusses rates on the telephone other traders 
stand nearby listening attentively 
money is not their only business 
we are international businessmen mohammad said we buy and 
sell everythingg i have bank accounts in london geneva and paris 
and i have traveled the world 
like most of his colleagues mohammad is strictly neutral in 
talking about the war 
war is terrible but this is business he said we will 
accept any government that will end this war and leave business 
alone 
mohammad sayeed a colleague observed if we are left to live 
in peace then the success we have will be nothing special we will 
just be rich

a chair that columbia university had promised to 
keep vacant until poland allowed historian and solidarity trade 
union adviser bronislaw geremek to travel to the united states was 
occupied at wednesdays commencement ceremonies by the scholar 
i think that poland is changing now in a good diretion 
geremek said speaking in an interview of recent reforms in his 
country 
for the first time in this part of the world in the 
communist system appeared a hope that the old totalitarian 
structure of this regime will disappear without a violent 
struggle he said 
geremek was one of six people to receive honorary doctorates as 
the university awarded degrees to more than 7300 graduating 
students in ceremonies on the lawn in front of the universitys low 
memorial library 
geremek was invited last year but the polish government refused 
to allow him to leave his country 
at the 1988 ceremony university president michael i sovern 
promised the chair set up for geremek would be vacant at every 
commencement until he was permitted to attend 
geremek a scholar of medieval european history and an adviser 
to solidarity leader lech walesa is also a candidate for 
parliament in poland 
professor geremeks absence and now his presence remind us 
forcefully of the alternating currents of futility and hope that 
run through our time sovern told the 7371 graduating students 
and their families 
in poland and the soviet union china and afghanistan central 
america southern africa the middle east from year to year and 
day to day the shining rays of optimism seem ready to brighten the 
darkness of old realities one moment to flicker and die the 
next he said 
in addition to geremek columbia awarded honorary doctorates to 
stage director lloyd george richards art historian and teacher 
edith porada educator sir ralf dahrendorf violinist itzhak 
perlman and cell biologist nicole m le dourain 
journalist anna quindlen received the universitys medal for 
excellence

many in the poor neighborhood of san 
felipe say they are suffering the wrath of the government for 
giving a resounding no to gen manuel antonio noriega in the 
presidential election 
the general and the defense forces are really angry with us 
down here said a man with two gold teeth enjoying a soft drink 
in a small grocery store 
they thought they bought our loyalty with contraband 
providing imported beer cheaply for us to sell allowing drugs and 
prostitition then when it came time to vote everybody voted 
against them 
the opposition which says it won the may 7 election called a 
general strike for wednesday to protest the governments 
nullification of the balloting 
but the strike did not take hold in san felipe chorrillo or 
santa ana three contiguous poor neighborhoods where many 
residents said they felt powerless after their vote was thrown out 
we creamed the government here said a woman in a worn 
tshirt and skirt smiling broadly now there are more cops and 
toads than ever 
paid government informants are known as sapos or toads 
nilda who asked to be identified only by her first name 
indicated with her chin two police officers who stood across the 
street watching 
if they come in here to bother us after you leave im going to 
tell them i love duque more than his own wife and that i was 
defending noriega to the foreign press she said referring to 
carlos duque noriegas handpicked presidential candidate 
otherwise they arrest you and charge you 300 that you dont 
have 
the strike slowed commercial and industrial activity slightly 
elsewhere but appeared to have been an overall failure 
businesses like mine buy today to sell today or tomorrow a 
little at a time we dont have the effect of the big department 
stores or wholesalers said the grocery store owner who wore a 
white apron and a blue baseball cap with the ford motor co logo 
the owner and four patrons said noriega should pack up and get 
out 
he personally has become the problem said the man drinking 
the soft drink who gave his name as luis he makes himself out 
to be the big nationalist but the country doesnt mean squat to 
him he only cares about his rackets 
in san miguelito another working class neighborhood on the 
opposite edge of the capital four women stood on the crest of a 
rise in the road banging pots and pans to express their displeasure 
with noriegas continued rule 
irsa herrera stooped to pick up some rocks and sticks and put 
them in the road 
we are going to block the streets she declared we want 
noreiga to go as soon as possible 
the other women added some spindly branches to the wouldbe 
barricade 
at the grocers shop in san felipe nilda said panamanians could 
do little to oust noriega and would simply have to wait until he 
makes up his mind to leave 
were not fighters luis said panamanians are not the 
kind of people to take to the streets to confront police and 
soldiers 
there has been talk of holding new elections for a successor to 
manuel solis palma the figurehead president whose term ends sept 
1 
but no one will vote if they have new elections said nilda 
for what so we can win again and they can annul it again

in delivery timing and wordplaybased humor 
but not in tone of voice lewis j stadlens portrayal of humorist 
sj perelman sounds like groucho marx 
groucho talking might have been interesting for an evening at 
offbroadways cherry lane theater but sj perelman in person 
which opened there wednesday night isnt very theatrical to put 
it kindly its high points are a slide show of perelmans friends 
during hollywood screenwriting days and the remembered witticisms 
of dorothy parker and george s kaufman its point of least 
interest is perelman helplessly putting together a childs truck on 
christmas eve 
the set by wes peters is a study painted brown of course 
perelman makes a pun of being in a brown study much like this 
one 
perelman who died in 1979 at 75 wrote essays and parodies 
many for the new yorker they were collected in some 20 books the 
writer obviously loved to use words unexpectedly 
i was reared and backhanded in providence stadlen says i 
had to come to new york to be affronted on the telephone he 
says my friend and i call you that in all insincerity you 
follow your own star he intones inspiringly ill follow hedy 
lamarr 
bob shanks wrote the oneman play based on perelmans writings 
shanks an indiana university graduate has been an abc programming 
vice president and now is managing director of a television network 
in australia he has written two books about tv and a novel ann 
shanks directed 
stadlen visually makes perelman a bespectacled 
nondescriptlooking man who brags about flamboyant female 
encounters his body language is good despite the mustache 
particularly when he portrays a stripper removing a long glove 
the actors broadway debut was as groucho marx in the musical 
minnies boys the memory of which probably worked against him 
in portraying sj perelman

hundreds of recovering drug addicts and their 
supporters marched to the statehouse demanding drug treatment on 
demand and chanting we want what kitty got 
the advocates charged wednesday that contrary to assertions by 
gov michael s dukakis during his presidential campaign drug 
programs in massachusetts reach only a fraction of those in need 
governor dukakis we are here to call you on your promise we 
want treatment now gregory davis a recovering addict who heads 
metro boston alive told the rally on the statehouse steps he said 
addicts are not interested in clean needles or methadone but do 
want treatment 
davis reminded his listeners that during the presidential 
campaign dukakis said no addict in massachusetts seeking help 
would be denied state officials concede that only about 4500 
addicts are in treatment on a given day out of an estimated 40000 
addicts statewide 
but dukakis administration officials note that public and 
private programs combined handle some 20000 admissions a year 
they say they are seeking funds to achieve the goal of treatment on 
demand 
public health commissioner deborah prothrowstith drew cheers 
when she told the crowd that the number of addicts in treatment has 
risen in two years from 7000 to 15000 
everybody deserves treatment when they need it she said 
weve come a pretty long way 
the advocates however booed and jeered her superior human 
services secretary philip johnston johnston who was representing 
dukakis who was nearly drowned out by chants put your money 
where your mouth is 
after accepting some 2500 petitions favoring treatment on 
demand johnston tried to assure the crowd that dukakis considers 
drug treatment a top priority 
throughout the rally advocates chanted we want what kitty 
got referring to the governors wife kitty dukakis who has 
acknowledged a lifelong chemical dependency 
she was treated for addiction to amphetamines five years ago and 
spent the month of february in a private residential treatment 
program in rhode island to address an alcohol problem that flared 
up after her husband lost the presidential election

the senate foreign relations committee on 
wednesday rejected a move to ban arms aid to any group in cambodia 
linked to the khmer rouge which is part of a threeparty 
resistance coalition led by prince norodom sihanouk 
the amendment to the annual state department authorization bill 
had been proposed by sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the 
panel and was opposed by the bush administration which supports 
sihanouks resistance effort against vietnamese forces occupying 
cambodia 
the six nations of the association of southeast asian nations 
also registered strong opposition to such a ban 
sen alan cranston dcalif agreed before the bipartisan vote 
to hold hearings in his asian and pacific affairs subcommittee on 
potential aid to the cambodian resistance cranston said the issue 
of sihanouks ties to the khmer rouge could be resolved in this 
weeks sinosoviet summit in beijing 
beijing has been supporting the khmer rouge while moscow backs 
vietnam the country that invaded cambodia in 1978 to end khmer 
rouge rule and has declared it will end its 10year occupation in 
september 
if the khmer rouge lose their chinese support as a result of 
decisions at the beijing summit it would be folly for us to 
intervene said cranston 
the khmer rouge are blamed for more than 1 million deaths during 
their 197578 rule over cambodia 
david lambertson deputy assistant secretary of state told the 
committee on wednesday that the administration has not made a 
decision yet on whether to seek lethal aid to sihanouks forces 
asked about a recent statement by vice president dan quayle that 
both overt and covert aid were under study lambertson assured the 
senators no moves would be made without informing members of 
congress

a 12yearold boy fidgeted at the 
defense table and clutched a stack of baseball cards as he pleaded 
guilty to murder and arson in the death of his babysitter 
blond crewcut scott james frequently grinned at his attorney 
and district court spectators after changing his plea wednesday in 
the dec 31 death of raymond r lauzon 
lawyers for both sides said they hope the boy can receive 
treatment that will help him turn his life around 
scott needs a lot of help and its time he got it defense 
attorney thomas van houten said scott needs some very 
significant intervention in his life 
the boy who was 11 when he set the fatal fire will be released 
from custody by his 21st birthday at the latest because he was 
tried as a juvenile judge alexander macnichol tentatively set a 
may 30 court date for determining what will be done for scott 
van houten said the boy likely will need to be sent to another 
state for treatment because maine lacks the services he requires 
the focus will be on treatment with the understanding that 
security will be a factor van houten said 
arson and murder certainly imply a kid whos pretty troubled 
and dangerous but we hope hes salvageable assistant attorney 
general eric wright said 
shortly before the murder trial was to begin the young 
defendant told the judge he started the fire 
but the boy disputed the prosecutions contention that he told 
his younger brother he wanted to see what it would be like to burn 
the house and kill the man 
wright said scott started the fire after the 53yearold lauzon 
caught him trying to steal some money from his wallet scott and 
his brother jason were staying in lauzons apartment while their 
mother janet sullivan went to a pub with lauzons son ronald on 
new years eve 
the judge ordered the biddeford boy returned to the maine youth 
center in south portland pending the may 30 hearing 
during the brief hearing the judge asked the boy did you 
start the fire 
yes i did the boy answered 
and you knew at the time you started the fire mr lauzon was 
upstairs in the house the judge asked 
yes i did 
and you knew you could hurt him macnichol asked 
yes i did 
scott pleaded guilty to felony murder and arson the prosecutor 
agreed to drop two additional murder charges each based on 
different theories of what happened

some conservatives certain of ronald reagans 
place in history are talking up the idea of finding a place for 
him too alongside the granite faces of four great presidents at 
mount rushmore 
and they think theyve gotten a wink from the man himself 
at least reagan smiled when an artists sketch was presented 
last summer showing him alongside the rushmore visages says r 
emmett tyrrell jr a promoter of the movement to add reagan 
he seemed pleased said tyrrell editorinchief of american 
spectator magazine a monthly conservative review 
tyrrell sounds half serious and half unserious about the 
idea but people are taking him entirely seriously he said 
tom griffith executive secretary of the mount rushmore society 
is seriously trying to spike the idea 
it wont happen he said 
the society raised the funds for the original project 60 years 
ago the faces of washington jefferson lincoln and theodore 
roosevelt drilled and dynamited into a mountainside of the black 
hills in south dakota are the largest carved figures anywhere 
washingtons is as high as a fivestory building bigger than any 
sphinx in egypt 
the simple fact is there is no more suitable rock to carve 
anyone at mount rushmore griffith said in an interview from 
rapid city sd 
why fool with a masterpiece he asked would you paint 
another figure next to the mona lisa 
retorts tyrrell smallminded people typical smallminded 
people 
tyrrell said he is creating a committee for monumental progress 
to promote the idea he said he has just written to reagan asking 
him to please consider allowing us to get a proper mold of his nose 
and at least one ear 
if tyrrell is only semiserious the young americans for freedom 
are threequarters there 
to test sentiment they put a ballot into a fundraising letter 
sent to 23000 average american citizens and will promote the 
idea if the response is enthusiastic says tom lizardo executive 
director of group 
the heat of the response not just numbers is the key 
thing said lizardo ballots will be opened in june he said 
donald devine a former reagan officeholder said he has signed 
a reagantorushmore petition although he thinks it may be early 
for so bold a move ten or 20 years from now might be better 
he said 
the whole country burns with interest said tyrrell weve 
had threats touch that mountain and well bomb you he said 
and other people with tears in their eyes oh mr tyrrell 
thank god someones thought of it 
griffith said additional faces have been proposed over the years 
franklin roosevelt and susan anthony have had a number of 
champions 
but tyrrell said reagan is the most logical choice because he 
brought peace and prosperity to a country riven by fear 
tyrrell said if theres no room for a carved reagan a place 
could be found for a cement nose a cement ear a cement chin 
of the former president 
as for the cost we want the whole bill to be footed by the 
people of south dakota its going to be their tourist trap and 
they ought to pay for it

four senators want congress to ban the use of 
the alar on apples even though apple growers say they intend to 
halt application of the controversial chemical because of fears by 
consumers 
if we do not ban alar from the market american consumers in 
increasing numbers will ban apples from their diet sen joe 
lieberman dconn told a news conference wednesday where the bill 
was unveiled 
the bill would ban the use of the chemical manufactured by 
uniroyal on foods effective as soon as the president affixed his 
signature besides apples alar also is commonly used on grapes 
cherries and peanuts 
the chemical which enhances the appearance of apples and keeps 
them from spoiling for longer periods has been shown to cause 
cancer in lab animals it still could be used on commercially grown 
flowers under the bill 
the food and drug administration estimated on march 16 that alar 
was used on 10 percent of the nations apple supply 
sen john warner rva indicated he would not wait for the 
measure to go through committee but instead would attempt to attach 
it to another bill that is nearing floor action the train is 
under way he declared 
other sponsors are sens harry reid dnev and donald w 
riegle jr dmich 
there were initial denials from the environmental protection 
agency that alar constitutes a health risk for consumers but apple 
sales have plunged in recent months amid concern about the chemical 
apples producers are facing a 100 million loss on the raw 
crop this year as a result of unfavorable reports concerning alar 
and there has been an additional 30 percent drop in apple juice 
sales according to derl i derr president of the international 
apple institute based in mclean va 
derr said his group composed of 23 state organizations 
representing an estimated 90 percent of the nations 15000 
commercial growers favors taking alar off the market but not by 
legislative means he said reducing the allowable amount to zero 
would require an epa finding that alar poses an imminent hazard 
and if you think we have a bad market now you should see what 
it would be like then derr said he said his group is urging 
growers to stop using the compound and is hoping uniroyal will 
voluntarily halt sales 
earlier this week derr said apple growers are already planning 
to eliminate alar by september of this year the already low 
levels of alar will be reduced to virtually zero simply the us 
apple industry is not going to use alar 
none of the four senators is a member of the senate agriculture 
committee which for years has balked at tough farm chemical 
regulation recommended by environmentalists and consumer advocates 
a similar bill was quietly introduced in the house earlier this 
year although no action has been taken on it

the energy department has run into a new delay 
in opening the nations first permanent dump for radioactive waste 
from its nuclear weapons complex 
previous delays in the 800 million waste isolation pilot 
project had threatened to interrupt the departments nuclear 
weapons production but energy secretary james d watkins told 
congress on wednesday he foresaw no major new problems 
watkins said the waste repository near carlsbad nm would 
not open as scheduled in september and it might not be ready 
before next february he held out the possibility that some waste 
could be entered at the site before the end of this year but said 
that wouldnt be determined until november 
watkins told the senate armed services committee that the 
environmental protection agency had fallen far behind schedule in 
providing a legally required verification that toxic wastes at the 
repository would not migrate off the site 
we physically cannot get through this process until 
november watkins said adding that under normal procedures it 
would take until next february before the epa could hold public 
hearings on the waste migration issue 
he gave no specific new target date for opening the facility 
the underground cavern would be the nations first permanent 
dump for plutoniumcontaminated wastes generated by the energy 
departments nuclear weapons production complex 
opening of the dump is considered an urgent priority for the 
department as well as for the state governments of idaho and 
colorado the governors of those states recently said they will not 
permit an indefinite buildup of hazardous wastes produced by energy 
department weapons plants near idaho falls and denver 
the repository originally was scheduled to open in 1988 one 
reason for the delay was that congress adjourned without 
transferring control of the federally owned site from the interior 
department to the energy department 
the landtransfer legislation was blocked by some members of the 
new mexico congressional delegation who have raised questions about 
safety 
the dump is expected eventually to hold about 900000 drums of 
plutoniumcontaminated waste about onefifth of the radioactive 
debris generated by the weapons complex in the last four decades 
watkins also told the senate panel he would produce by july a 
firm schedule for restarting the first of three nuclear reactors in 
south carolina that are the nations only source of tritium a 
perishable gas needed to make nuclear warheads all three reactors 
were shut down last spring for safety reasons 
watkins had disclosed last month that the target date for 
restarting the k reactor at the savannah river site near aiken 
sc had been pushed back from late 1989 to early 1990 
the energy secretary also urged the committee to support a bush 
administration proposal for building new reactor complexes one in 
south carolina the other in idaho to replace the aging savannah 
river reactors in the mid1990s the cost of building both reactors 
has been put at 68 billion 
watkins acknowledged that one reactor would produce enough 
tritium to meet the governments weapons requirements but he said 
duality was needed to ensure that a forced shutdown of one 
reactor would not endanger the nations weapons supply 
i believe the most compelling example of this problem is that 
new production of tritium or plutonium is essentially impossible 
within this country as long as the three savannah river production 
reactors remain out of service watkins said adding that the 
soviet union currently operates 11 such reactors 
critics contend one reactor would be enough particularly in 
light of the federal budget deficit problem and prospects for 
further ussoviet disarmament 
we just dont have the money to do these things said sen

the ethics investigation of house speaker jim 
wright has attracted little interest among the public despite its 
dominance of newspaper front pages says a gallup poll 
instead people are more interested in the alaska oil spill 
sixty percent of those polled in a newstrack survey released 
wednesday said they did not even know who wright was and only 15 
percent of respondents said they were following the ethics 
investigation of the texas democrat very closely 
the poll was conducted for the los angelesbased times mirror 
media company 
the only news story among seven selections that attracted more 
apathy than wrights tribulations was the resignation of japanese 
prime minister noboru takeshita in the wake of financial scandal 
only 12 percent of those polled could even identify takeshita as 
japans former leader and just 6 percent of respondents said they 
were following developments very closely 
but the exxon valdezs spill of 11 million gallons of oil into 
alaskas prince william sound has piqued the interest of the 
public the survey said fiftytwo percent of respondents said they 
were following oil spill developments very closely while 37 
percent said they were watching fairly closely 
in fact 36 percent of respondents said the exxon valdez 
incident was the news story they were following most closely 
on the other hand 30 percent of respondents said they were 
following the wright probe not at all closely and 43 percent 
said the same of the takeshita resignation 
the seven news stories about which respondents were polled 
included the wright probe the oil spill the takeshita 
resignation the alleged rape and beating by a youth gang of a 
jogger in new yorks central park the oliver north trial the 
supreme courts hearing on arguments in a missouri abortion case 
and the explosion and fire that killed 47 sailors on the uss iowa 
the telephone survey of 1239 adults was conducted from may 47 
and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points 
the survey conducted by the gallup organization is the first of 
a regular series to be done for the times mirror center for press

portugals bestknown revolutionary 
otelo saraiva de carvalho was greeted by cheering neighbors and 
friends when he returned home today after spending five years in 
prison 
it was saraiva de carvalho who masterminded the 1974 revolution 
that toppled almost 50 years rightwing dictatorship in portugal 
the supreme court of justice ordered him free wednesday after 
throwing out his may 1987 conviction on charges of leading a 
terrorist group in the early 1980s that pledged to seek a halt to 
the unbridled advance of capitalism 
the court had accepted saraiva de carvalhos appeal that 
authorities violated the constitution by making him await trial for 
longer than the threeyear maximum stipulated by law 
the onetime chief of portugals revolutionary security police 
had been serving a 15year sentence 
saraiva de carvalho known throughout portugal simply as otelo 
was arrested in 1984 on charges of leading the leftwing group 
popular forces of april 25 which was blamed for terrorist attacks 
and at least 15 killings 
hundreds of supporters shouted long live april 25 as 
saraiva de carvalho emerged wednesday from the prison in tomar 
about 90 miles north of lisbon that was the date of the 1974 
overthrow 
more than 100 wellwihers set off firecrackers and cheered when 
he arrived by car early today at his familys modest apartment in 
this lisbon suburb 
before entering the house to greet his wife and daughter he 
embraced two former revolutionary captains vitor alves and mario 
tome 
saraiva de carvalho regularly wore his lieutenant colonels army 
uniform while in prison and consistently protested his innocence 
saying mine was without doubt a political trial 
twice a presidential candidate he was jailed in 1975 for an 
alleged role in a failed leftwing countercoup but later released 
rtp state television reported that 28 members of the popular 
forces jailed with him also received notice of release

a rare form of blindness has been traced to an 
error in genes of the bodys tiny power plants known as 
mitochondria according to a report published today 
mitochondria reside by the thousands inside cells where they 
produce the energy that the body needs to stay alive far in the 
evolutionary past these structures were independent creatures and 
they still have genes that are separate from the rest of the bodys 
blue prints 
in a report in the new england journal of medicine dr douglas 
c wallace and colleagues from emory university present evidence 
that a single pinpoint error in these genes is the cause of a form 
of inherited eye disease called lebers hereditary optic neuropathy 
the team said they found the same error in two families with the 
disease one american black and the other european white they 
theorize that the genetic error occured independently in the two 
families 
mitochondria and their genes are passed from generation to 
generation only by mothers the fathers contribution is lost 
during the early moments of an embryos development mitochondrial 
genes produce 13 proteins that are essential for life 
in a separate report in the journal researchers from 
columbiapresbyterian medical center in new york present evidence 
that rare muscle disorders can result from deletions of parts of 
the mitochondrial genes 
the research consolidates the growing evidence that defects of 
this small part of the human genome cause disease dr ae 
harding of the institute of neurology in london wrote in an

mikhail s gorbachev wrapping up a historic 
visit called wednesday for demilitarizing the chinesesoviet 
border and said unrest in china is part of a necessary process of 
evolution for the communist nation 
on the last full day of his trip the soviet president said he 
hoped the mass protests that have disrupted the beijing summit 
would end in a negotiated settlement 
a difficult painful but political dialogue is going on 
between the leadership the youth and the public concerning these 
events and it seems to me that we should welcome that fact he 
said 
as the soviet leader spoke more than 1 million chinese poured 
into the streets to demonstrate for democratic reforms in china 
the protests spread to at least 20 provincial capitals including 
shanghai where at least 70 students were on a hunger strike 
gorbachev on thursday traveled to shanghai where he was 
welcomed by the citys communist party chief jiang zemin and 
mayor zhu rongji he was to conclude his fourday trip with a tour 
of a special economic zone one of the showcases of economic reform 
that the soviet union is trying to emulate 
at a news conference wednesday gorbachev defended socialist 
countries experiencing unrest as they attempt to make reforms 
if anyone thinks this will lead us to the ash heap of history 
i think they will be disappointed again he said 
earlier in a nationally televised interview gorbachev said the 
summit that normalized relations between the nations went well 
despite all the tensions from the huge demonstrations that have 
altered his itinerary 
he said he felt welcome in the city where no soviet leader had 
set foot for three decades 
in a speech to chinese academics in the great hall of the 
people gorbachev urged that the 4300mile frontier where 16 
million troops now face each other be turned into a border of 
peace and good neighborliness 
he said an earlier pledge to withdraw 200000 troops from asia 
would be fulfilled by the end of next year and would include the 
pullout of 12 divisions or 120000 soldiers from the border 
the soviet union is believed to have about 600000 troops along 
the border the chinese armed with less modern equipment have 
more than 1 million troops stationed there 
gorbachev said 11 air force regiments would be disbanded and 16 
warships would be removed from the pacific fleet 
gorbachev also said 
soviet and chinese negotiating positions on cambodia are 
very very close to each other but that the two sides failed to 
agree on a satisfactory settlement of the struggle in which 
sovietbacked vietnamese occupation forces are battling 
chinesebacked cambodian guerrillas 
he said there is now light at the end of the tunnel 
the united states should withdraw its forces from south korea 
in a bid to resolve that regional touble spot 
chinesesoviet trade which the two sides hope will increase 
with normalization presents a poor picture at present but new 
ventures between the two countries and completion of a new rail 
line linking beijing and moscow should improve trade 
all asian and pacific countries with un help should set up 
a mechanism for resolving regional disputes that still threaten 
peace in the region most notably now in cambodia and afghanistan 
gorbachev said the soviet union is prepared to work for the 
withdrawal on terms to be agreed with china of military units and 
armaments from the border areas leaving only the personnel 
required for performing routine border guard duties 
demilitarizing the sovietchinese border and turning it into a 
border of peace and goodneighborliness is a noble goal which we 
could attain through joint efforts he said 
on tuesday in a meeting with premier li peng gorbachev said 
we want the sovietchinese border to be protected only by 
friendship he also called for regular consultations between the 
militaries of the two countries 
the two sides fought a brief border war over the disputed 
frontier in 1969 and sporadic clashes have continued over the 
years but tensions have slowly eased during the 1980s 
on monday the day gorbachev arrived in beijing moscow began 
pulling troops out of mongolia the soviet ally along chinas 
northern border the kremlin has said it will withdraw 50000 
troops threefourths of the soviet force in mongolia by the end 
of 1990 
chinese leaders have generally welcomed the soviet troop 
reduction while claiming that it has not yet gone far enough 
senior leader deng xiaoping head of the chinese military also 
has reduced the peoples liberation army from more than 4 million 
in 1985 to about 3 million today most of those troops are 
stationed along the soviet border and chinas volatile border with 
vietnam 
china and other asian nations have been cool to gorbachevs 
concept of collective security in asia expressing fear it is a 
soviet attempt to increase its strategic influence in the area 
gorbachev however said collective efforts were of cardinal 
importance both for asia and for the entire world 
he also spoke of his talks with deng and other chinese leaders 
saying they were an important milestone and that a long 
period of mutual alienation is now behind us 
on tuesday the two sides announced the normalization of 
government and party relations ending a 30year rift caused by 
ideological and strategic differences

new doubts have been cast on bush administration 
claims that there was no deal between the reagan administration and 
honduras on aid to the nicaragua contras according to a report 
published today 
the new york times says classified documents describe similar 
dealings at the time with guatemala and costa rica 
the times cites a classified december 1985 memo written by 
oliver north to his boss at the national security council john m 
poindexter poindexter was about to visit honduras and meet with 
gen walter lopez head of the honduran military 
the memo which earlier was released in heavily edited form by 
the congressional committees which investigated the irancontra 
affair referred to a decision by the honduran military to cut off 
the delivery of weapons to the rebels the times said 
north wrote from previous meetings with lopez it is obvious 
that the hondurans perceive the usg united states government 
is using honduras for its own political ends they have learned 
that we withhold our assistance in order to force concessions 
from them they are now using this same tactic with us as a means 
of insuring that the usg will come through for them 
lopez and his colonels recognize that the only leverage they 
have over us is their covert support for the nicaraguan 
resistance the memo said 
another document cited by the times was written by alan fiers 
chief of the cias central america task force it was directed to 
thencia director william j casey and dated oct 23 1986 shortly 
before congress voted to allow the agency to resume assistance to 
the contras 
fiers reported on a trip to honduras guatemala and costa rica 
to discuss logistical help for the contra aid effort 
the hondurans agreed to fully support the program and to 
allow supplies to begin moving as scheduled fiers wrote they 
were very clear as to what they seek in return support for the 
purchase of advanced aircraft with those aircraft arriving as soon 
as possible within six months 
fiers added we must be as responsive as we need to insure 
this cooperation yet at the same time remain within the bounds of 
propriety 
the times said fiers also wrote that in guatemala the cia would 
be paying for the guatemalan program of internal support to 
nicaraguan political parties and working with them in structuring 
this program 
in return for president vinicio cerezos support we will be 
assisting him in establishing a public relationsmedia operation 
designed to strengthen his image and democracy in guatemala the 
memo said 
fiers wrote that officials in costa rica had deep concerns about 
the contra program but had agreed to support it politically and 
diplomatically by taking the lead in criticizing nicaragua and 
insisting on a democratic form of government 
the memo added that the officials spent considerable time 
discussing their financial problems and asked for usg help in 
negotiating a rescheduling agreement with us banks

a senate panel has moved the energy industry 
one step closer to a longsought prize it says will benefit 
consumers as well as commerce 
the senate energy and natural resources by a 172 vote 
approved legislation wednesday to lift remaining price controls on 
natural gas by 1993 
experts generally agree that natural gas prices would be 
unlikely to rise immediately in reaction to ending price controls 
since the market price currently is well below the controlled 
price many industry officials predict however that growing 
demand for gas in the 1990s would likely push prices substantially 
higher 
the full senate may consider the bill which is strongly 
supported by the bush administration as early as next week the 
house passed a nearly identical bill last month with virtually no 
dissent

all 19 members of the senate foreign relations 
committee want president bush to ask soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to clarify the soviet commitment to the treaty banning 
mediumrange nucleararmed missiles 
the senators said they were disturbed by a recent remarks by 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze that the soviets might 
not dismantle their ss23 mediumrange missiles as required by the 
treaty if nato nations modernize their shortrange nuclear weapons 
it is in neither sides interest at this time to challenge 
that agreement the senators said in a letter made public 
wednesday both sides should instead be building on the 
achievements of the inf accord and moving forward to take advantage 
of the many promising opportunities before us in eastwest

a leader of a campaign against restrictions 
on facsimile transmissions couldnt get his fax straight he 
inadvertently caused an electronic mail deluge that irked one 
governor into outlawing the messages 
who would have anticipated that this many responses would have 
been generated elliott segal of the national fax users committee 
wondered wednesday after last weeks fax flood on the phone lines 
of connecticut gov william a oneill 
fax machines which can send a page of text or illustration over 
telephone lines in about a minute are used for everything from 
sending documents between lawyers to getting in a speedy order to 
the sandwich shop 
before lucille balls death last month the machine at 
cedarssinai medical center churned out getwell messages virtually 
nonstop said hospital spokesman ron wise 
i am completely convinced the fax machine is destined to 
become the hallmark card of the 90s wise said 
but a campaign to make them a lobbying tool so irked oneill 
that on tuesday the governor signed into a law a measure allowing 
people receiving unsolicited fax messages to seek up to 200 in 
damages 
oneill said the lobbyists overwhelmed his office fax machine on 
friday as he awaited details on flood conditions from the state 
office of emergency management 
frankly last week was the first time the need for this kind 
of legislation was brought home to me the governor said 
maryland gov william donald schaefer may sign a similar law 
with a fine of up to 1000 after receiving 343 fax messages last 
week 
at least nine other states are considering fax caps 
the deluge to the governors was a very unfortunate 
situation said segal who described himself in a telephone 
interview as kind of a point man i guess for the fax users 
committee 
the committee is a looseknit group of users without a 
headquarters or president said segal 
its becoming evident though that it needs to become more 
structured he said i never would have anticipated this type 
of coverage for that 
segal is vice president of marketing for mr fax an 
irvinebased firm that sells facsimile paper to about 30000 
customers including 5000 in california they advertise he said 
by sending facsimile transmissions to 500000 fax users nationwide 
segal said 3000 fax fliers were sent to maryland businesses 
for relay to the governor hundreds complied but the lobbying 
effort rattled nerves instead of opinions 
if we had any important messages coming in we wouldnt have 
been able to get them through said david s iannucci the 
governors lobbyist 
iannucci called the oneday campaign incredibly 
counterproductive saying it might help persuade schaefer to sign 
the bill 
bills to regulate facsimile transmissions also are being 
considered by legislatures in california rhode island new york 
florida pennsylvania texas new jersey louisiana and washington 
the furor over faxing has grown as advertisers take advantage of 
the machines rising popularity besides tying up the receiving 
machine uninvited advertising uses up its expensive special paper 
donna murdoch executive director of the american facsimile 
association in philadelphia said the group doesnt think 
advertising by fax works anyway unless youre selling fax 
paper her group estimates there are 3 million fax machines in 
this country 
segals group isnt alone in getting state officials attention 
new york state consumer protection chief richard kessel said he 
was about to send an important memo to gov mario cuomo when his 
machine spit out a threepage menu from a sandwich shop now new 
york legislators are considering banning junk fax 
ohio state rep otto beatty last month introduced a bill to ban 
fax ads he said he was irritated when an ad for mens clothing 
appeared on his law office machine interrupting an exchange of 
documents during a business negotiation 
washington state rep ken jacobsen who introduced a bill 
against junk fax said of the issue this is the ultimate in 
abusive use of a private communication system you get a message 
you didnt want from people you dont know on paper they didnt 
buy

student demonstrations are stirring 
again after 10 years of relative quiet on indonesian campuses 
the protests so far have been mild as students from several 
colleges test the limits of tolerance but they have been taken 
seriously by officials in a country with a history of student 
militancy 
in 1966 students were a powerful force in agitating for the 
removal of the late president sukarno in favor of his eventual 
successor gen suharto 
and it was a group of students whil in 1945 kidnapped sukarno 
and persuaded him to declare independence from the dutch 
students were a constant headache for the authorities in the 
1970s helping spark the socalled malari riots in january 1974 
during a visit by then japanese prime minister kakuei tanaka 
a student demonstration was joined by thousands of poor 
jakartans who took to the streets in a mass protest against the 
unequal distribution of wealth 
when order was restored 13 people had died 770 were arrested 
including many students and property damage was extensive 
the rioting was officially blamed on two banned political 
parties allegedly trying to overthrow the government security was 
tightened 11 newspapers were closed and a couple of senior 
generals lost their jobs 
the government was disturbed by the uprising however and 
suharto ordered the rich to stop flaunting their wealth 
student dissent flared again when suharto was reelected 
unopposed for a third term in march 1978 and activists who accused 
suharto and his family of corruption were briefly jailed 
by then the authorities had had enough 
student political activity was banned and student councils 
abolished in their previous form as pressure groups for political 
action 
students had to sign statements when they enrolled promising not 
to take part in political activity or criticize the government 
while on campus 
scores of expulsions enforced the disciplinary mood and activist 
professors also were ousted 
the regulations remain in effect and student demonstrations 
still are banned but controls have been eased in recent months 
clearly with official sanction diplomatic observers say 
students have taken to the streets to protest against the 1978 
ban on political activity on campus they have also voiced 
opposition to a 25 percent increase in electricity charges and the 
limited compensation for families forced from land in central java 
by construction of a world bankfinanced dam 
demonstrations by as many as 2000 students at a time have been 
generally peaceful last month troops reportedly entered the 
campus of the islamic university in bandung 110 miles southeast of 
jakarta and student leaders said 50 of their colleagues were 
injured the army denied any violence 
students at the jakarta teachers training college reacted with 
a demonstration in which they burned a papiermache replica of a 
military boot 
the reaction of top officials has been ambivalent 
president suharto said university rectors should be held 
responsible for the behavior of their students several rectors 
rejected this saying they were not responsible for the offcampus 
activities of their students 
demonstrations or protest rallies are clearly unacceptable 
said armed forces spokesman brig gen nurhadi purwosaputro but 
the armed forces commanderinchief gen try sutrisno was quoted 
as saying demonstrations were allowed providing they were not 
disorderly 
education and culture minister fuad hassan himself a student 
activist in the mid1960s said students had the right to express 
public concern as long as they do not launch demonstrations on 
behalf of their universities 
home affairs minister rudini said he was not concerned yet 
with the recent student protests because they are still 
tolerable and not disturbing national stability

jim beam brands co was cleared of negligence in 
a lawsuit by a woman who said her son suffered birth defects 
because she drank its whiskey during pregnancy 
harold and candance thorp of seattle were seeking about 4 
million in damages for lifetime assistance for their 4yearold son 
michael who is retarded and deformed 
mrs thorp 39 testified she was an alcoholic who drank up to a 
fifth of jim beam a day during her pregnancy but she and her 
husband insisted she would have stopped drinking had the bottles 
carried a warning label for pregnant women 
were obviously disappointed with the verdict but the jury 
system operates said their lawyer barry epstein 
epstein said the us district court jurys verdict was not a 
total loss he said he didnt think wednesdays decision would set 
a precedent for similar cases 
we feel that this litigation has created an awareness in the 
public that if it saves one child it will all be worth it he 
said we hope as a result of this case that news of the 
dangers of alcohol will be spread far and wide 
he said no decision had been made on an appeal 
shannon stafford jim beams chief lawyer said he was 
obviously pleased but declined further comment 
during the trial epstein had argued that beam had an obligation 
to warn the public about the health risks of alcohol consumption by 
pregnant women 
but witnesses for beam said mrs thorp had been warned 
repeatedly by relatives and friends about the dangers of drinking 
alcohol while pregnant and that she and other alcoholics would not 
have heeded a warning label 
beam also contended that the boys problems were caused by 
heredity and neglect not by his mothers alcohol abuse 
the decision seemed so obvious said staci gilbreth a 
22yearold juror who had a baby in december i was surprised 
they were suing jim beam 
they could have sued everyone said geraldine jackson 32 
another juror who referred to testimony that mrs thorp had been 
seen drinking beer in bars several times during her pregnancy 
jurors said they decided the danger of alcohol to developing 
fetuses was common knowledge at the time of mrs thorps pregnancy 
and said that was a factor in their decision to deny damages 
about 1 percent of the infants born in the united states each 
year or 35000 babies are born with fetal alcohol syndrome the 
syndrome was identified in the united states by physicians at the 
university of washington in seattle in 1973 although a french 
doctor had pinpointed it several years earlier in france 
symptoms include slow growth central nervous system impairment 
hyperactivity mental retardation and distorted facial 
characteristics 
starting in november a new federal law will require all 
alcoholic beverage containers to carry warnings about birth defects 
and other health hazards related to drinking

local elections may yield clues 
to whether moderates have gained ground in the wake of a string of 
bungled irish republican army attacks 
counting of the votes in wednesdays balloting began this 
morning but the provinces complex system of proportional 
representation meant first results were not expected for several 
hours and the final tally was due late friday 
some 900 candidates are seeking the 566 seats on 26 district 
councils in the british province where protestants outnumber roman 
catholics 3to2 seventeen of the councils are controlled by the 
two predominantly protestant unionist parties and the rest by 
predominantly catholic nationalist parties 
analysts say further gains by the nonviolent social democratic 
and labor party a moderate catholic organization at the cost of 
sinn fein the legal political arm of the outlawed ira may be due 
to the iras bomb and bullet campaign to end british rule 
ira attacks have lately been claiming a number of socalled 
innocent victims civilians not involved with the security forces 
in the latest embarrassment to sinn fein an ira bomb attached 
to a belfast telegraph pole left a 3yearold catholic girl in 
hospital with shrapnel in her foot 
as voters went to the polls wednesday the headline in the irish 
news the provinces leading catholic newspaper said blood from 
a baby signals provo horror provo is a nickname for the ira 
the social democratic and labor party has posted some gains 
since the november 1985 angloirish agreement that gave the irish 
government a consultative role in the governing of northern 
ireland london and dublin hoped the agreement would cut the ground 
from under sinn fein 
the mainly catholic ira wants to unite northern ireland with the 
95 percent catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule 
on the protestant side the hardline democratic unionist party 
faces allegations that former allies in a shadowy movement called 
ulster resistance plotted to swap stolen missile technology from a 
belfast arms factory for south african guns 
ulster resistance was formed to fight the angloirish agreement 
and was associated with democratic unionist party leader rev ian 
paisley who says these links were subsequently severed 
also discomforting to the unionist parties is a renewed outbreak 
of sectarian killings by protestant gunmen the latest of which 
claimed the life of a catholic carpenter in belfast on monday 
malachy trainor 34 was buried wednesday in his home town of 
kilkeel and in his eulogy bishop cahal daly blamed the murder on 
the creeping oil slick of sectarianism 
he said many recent murders stemmed from plain oldfashioned 
unreconstructed antiroman catholic bigotry based on outmoded 
theologies long since left far behind by world protestantism

a stubborn pony brought to a thirdfloor 
science classroom was trapped for five hours and had to be sedated 
twice before firemen could carry it from the high school building 
the pony went up the steps readily but would not come down 
again fire lt rick balog said wednesday 
the 400pound pony named penny was finally freed wednesday night 
when 10 firemen and veterinarian william lake of jefferson 
carried the sedated animal downstairs in a basketlike stretcher 
balog said it took two tries to sedate penny 
the problem wasnt the ponys weight but the fact that she 
wanted to kick like a bucking bronco balog said we got a few 
bruised shins believe me 
balog said penny attended classes at ashtabula high school all 
day as part of a students project for science courses he said 
students teachers and administrators discovered at the end of the 
day that penny violently refused to walk down stairs 
we dont do animal rescues but it was hard to refuse he 
said they were begging us

a man in custody today on charges of 
planting 13 bombs around his southern indiana hometown last summer 
may have been targeting a state lawmaker authorities said 
john m hubbard iii 31 was arrested wednesday with jerry a 
conrad 42 a former coworker in salem said us attorney deborah 
j daniels both were being held without bond at the marion county 
jail 
although she wouldnt discuss a motive daniels said state rep 
frank newkirk jr the 32yearold son of salems mayor may have 
been a target 
hubbard told other people that he felt very strongly about mr 
newkirk and that he hated him she said he didnt say why 
a grand jury was scheduled to convene today in indianapolis to 
consider 29 preliminary charges against each suspect 14 counts of 
manufacturing destructive devices 13 counts of attempting to 
damage property one count of conspiracy to manufacture destructive 
devices and one count of unlawful possession of stolen explosives 
convictions on all counts could bring maximum penalties of 285 
years in prison and 7 million in fines 
during a hearing in new albany a federal magistrate granted a 
government motion for a psychological examination of hubbard and 
set a may 31 competency hearing 
the motion said hubbard has a history of emotional problems 
stemming in part from substance and alcohol abuse 
hubbard is a selfstyled survivalist who has stated that he 
is armed for a confrontation with the police or anyone else 
and that he will never go to jail even if convicted at a trial 
the motion said 
in december 1988 hubbard twice telephoned the nicaraguan 
embassy in washington dc asking for political asylum hubbard 
claims to be personally acquainted with daniel ortega the 
nicaraguan president 
the bombs were found july 5 around salem a town of 5500 
residents seven bombs which were in paper grocery sacks had been 
stashed under bridges the remainder were hidden near businesses 
and government buildings 
none exploded three burned causing minor damage 
hubbard who went to school with newkirk considered the state 
representative to be a lifelong rival according to an 
affidavit 
there are indications in the affidavit that john hubbard bore 
some animosity toward frank newkirk jr and bore some animosity 
toward an employer of his daniels told reporters in her 
indianapolis office 
newkirk acknowledged that he may have been the target 
i know from his comments in the newspaper and from our 
conversations he considers himself to be a very liberal person and 
im pretty conservative he said also i believed from our 
discussions that he has a dislike or resentment for government and 
i may represent government to him 
newkirk said he and hubbard occasionally spoke when they met on 
the street but he does not know conrad who worked with hubbard at 
ferraloy industries in salem 
this has been a real stressful time for our family and were 
very relieved that the arrest has been made newkirk said 
newkirk noted that he was married 11 years ago wednesday and 
called the arrests a nice anniversary present 
ron marker whose sister found 25 sticks of dynamite wired to 
explode behind the family service station said the arrests brought 
some relief to salem 
its been going on for a long time he said i hope they 
got them

students at two high schools with high dropout 
rates can earn extra scholarship money by keeping their grades up 
the fouryear 45 million pilot program at the schools in 
detroit and dallas will provide scholarships for students who earn 
c averages have good attendance and avoid disciplinary problems 
pepsicola co officials said wednesday 
fifty teachers chosen at each school to tutor and counsel 
children will receive 1000 each 
the program was announced in assemblies this week at 
southwestern high school in detroit and lg pinkston high school 
in dallas 
the company hopes to encourage students to set and meet goals 
and give them enough financial assistance after graduation to help 
them succeed said craig weatherup president of pepsicola a 
division of pepsico inc 
we hope this program will serve as a model for other 
corporations because we need their involvement he said 
continued failure to make the benefits of our economic system 
available to all of our citizens would be disastrous michigan 
officials welcomed pepsis interest though they said the state 
already guarantees college tuition help for students below poverty 
level who graduate from high school 
at southwestern whose students are 80 percent black or other 
minorities the dropout rate is about 33 percent 
pinkston has a 99 percent minority enrollment with more than 
half the students from impoverished homes twentyone percent of 
pinkstons students dropped out last year 
the program will let students earn scholarship credit of 250 a 
semester beginning in the 198990 school year 
a senior graduating in 1990 could win 500 in assistance while 
a ninth grader could earn a 2000 scholarship by the time of 
graduation in 1993 
the funds are for accredited education or for other training 
such as vocational school 
each school will receive an additional grant of 4000 for 
administrative costs

a new process for forming ultrathin 
components of microchips eventually will allow significantly more 
information to be stored on them university of texas researchers 
say 
they announced wednesday that their process lowers by hundreds 
of degrees the temperature at which thin layers of crystalline 
silicon material the building blocks of microchips can be grown 
although the process wont be fully felt in the microelectronics 
industry for a decade university officials called it a major 
breakthrough 
af tasch a developer of the process and a professor of 
computer and electrical engineering said using lower temperatures 
for crystalline silicon growth would allow much smaller transistors 
to be built and many more transistors to be put on a single 
microchip 
the result a chip that could hold substantially more data while 
remaining the same size 
he called it a major step in paving the way for the 
microelectronics industry to go from millions to billions of 
devices on a single chip 
if you want to make integrated circuits that have greater 
computing power or store more information you have to make 
transistors smaller and smaller tasch said 
the industry is reaching a point where these transistor 
structures we are using today cannot be shrunk any smaller 
in order to come up with new transistor concepts which work at 
even smaller dimensions whatever you build has to be done with 
lower temperatures 
tasch and his university of texas colleague sk banerjee 
worked with a team at the research triangle institute in north 
carolina to develop the process 
traditionally making microchips involves a series of steps at 
temperatures often exceeding 1400 degrees fahrenheit the new 
process allows singlecrystal growth at temperatures as low as 300 
degrees fahrenheit 
tasch said the old heat level has limited the number of 
materials and the size of the transistors that can be combined on a 
single chip 
if you have high temperature treatment like that used in 
traditional fabrication you cannot maintain these small 
dimensions tasch said all the details get washed out the 
hightemperature process causes the materials to mix 
shrinking the size and improving the capacity of computer chips 
topped a list of 22 technologies designated by the us government 
in march as critical to national security 
were talking about the ability to store the equivalent 
information in a few sets of encyclopedias on a future microchip 
the size of your thumbnail such chips will handle all of this data 
at supercomputer speeds tasch said 
tasch and his coworkers who began their project about 2 years 
ago are scheduled to present their findings at the electronic 
materials conference at the massachusetts institute of technology 
next month

the dollar gained for a sixth day and closed today 
at an 18month high against the yen while the key index on the 
tokyo stock exchange fell 
the dollar finished at 13888 yen up 118 yen from wednesdays 
13770yen close it was the dollars highest close since 13855 
yen on oct 30 1987 
the dollar which now has gained 444 yen in six trading days 
opened today at 13945 and ranged between 13860 yen and 13948 yen 
daiwa securities trader mitsuhiko kinugasa attributed the 
dollars surge to an improvement in the us trade deficit 
the united states reported on wednesday that the deficit in 
march fell to 886 billion from 982 billion in february 
the dollar fell from its opening level however on dollar 
selling by speculative investors and the bank of japan which has 
intervened to support the yen kinugasa said the central bank 
reportedly sold about 1 billion it does not comment publicly on 
its intervention 
kinugasa said the market still was expecting a stronger dollar 
on the stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues lost 13612 points or 040 percent to close at 3385633 
it gained 6600 points on wednesday 
investors were selling spot shares mainly for arbitrage but 
afternoon purchases by speculative investors helped erase some of 
the losses said genjiro sasaki a dealer with new japan securities 
co 
the market lacked buying incentives largely due to the yens 
weakness on the foreign exchange market he said 
the yens downward trend and uncertainties about a possible rise 
in japanese interest rates left investors unable to determine the 
likely direction of trading he said 
trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 600 
million shares down from wednesdays 800 million

raymond carver was a poor student with poor 
prospects when he graduated from yakima high school in 1956 
now his stories are taught in english classes and this week the 
late author became only the second graduate of the school to be 
honored with a permanent display 
the other is former us supreme court justice william o 
douglas another maverick who rose to prominence from low 
beginnings 
its not often that you have a graduate go on to receive world 
recognition for his work as a writer linda brown an english 
teacher who led the drive for a carver memorial said wednesday 
its sad when we are not recognized more fully by our hometown 
and school while alive she said but its better late than 
never 
mondays dedication was attended by carvers widow poet tess 
gallagher of port angeles 
i think the things that started him on the road started 
here ms gallagher said 
the homemade woodframed memorial to carver who died of cancer 
at age 50 last year contains a photograph some of his poetry 
some of his fishing lures a fountain pen a white rose and a 
handwritten note with a premise for a story 
argument between couple but narrator only sees back of mans 
head the whole time the note says 
in a temporary display at the library are carvers high school 
diploma and a senior yearbook showing a cleancut young man whose 
only listed activity was working on the school paper as a junior 
the actual school building that carver attended was razed years 
ago davis high school was built on the site 
it is perhaps fitting that carvers memorial is at a school that 
has both the states highest dropout rate over 50 percent 
according to state figures and a reputation for innovative 
education programs such as threeday singletopic seminars for the 
entire student body 
ms brown said carvers life illustrates that students who get 
the best grades are not always the most talented and that people 
mature at different rates 
many of the kids who drop out of schools are gifted 
kids she said 
carver was born in clatskanie ore and grew up in yakima his 
father worked in a lumber mill and his mother was a waitress 
he moved to california after graduation and began to be 
published a few years later while an undergraduate at humboldt 
state he later was a janitor at a sacramento hospital and for a 
decade was an alcoholic he later taught at syracuse university in 
new york 
widespread critical acclaim didnt come until the 1970s and it 
was only in the 1980s that a major outpouring of his books 
appeared the latest a new path to the waterfall is due out 
soon 
his works were translated into 20 languages and near the end of 
his life he was widely regarded as one of the nations finest 
writers 
his writings reflected the desperate underclass caught in 
deadend jobs with few prospects many were inspired by his 
impoverished youth in yakima one of the reasons a bbc television 
crew was in town recently filming a documentary on his life 
carvers life in yakima was bleak perhaps but it was still 
his home ms brown said ray carver characters are the people 
ive met in yakima

students held aloft a black and white coffin 
inscribed with the words guandao official corruption while 
drumbeating flagwaving colleagues sounded a death knell and the 
crowds roared with approval 
the scene on the steps of the great hall of the people was one 
of the constant reminders that protesters who have taken over the 
streets of beijing consider halting corruption as important as 
bringing about democratic reform 
antipathy toward official corruption is particularly strong 
among blue and whitecollar workers who have joined student ranks 
in demanding radical change from the ruling communist party 
corruption is endemic in chinese life 
on the petty side party and government officials use their 
positions to obtain precious train or concert tickets find jobs 
for inlaws commandeer spacious apartments or weasel trips abroad 
more seriously officials take advantage of the nations 
economic disorder to get hold of scarce raw materials such as coal 
and fertilizer at low stateset prices and then sell them at far 
higher prices on the free market 
officials access to soughtafter goods has also made them 
easily susceptible to bribery many consider receiving money 
lavish banquets color television sets or stereos all part of the 
job 
there is deep resentment of nepotism and the charmed lives of 
luxury the sons and daughters of high officials enjoy 
one of the first posters to go up at beijing university during 
the current student unrest listed several dozen senior officials 
who it alleged got their jobs because of family connections 
premier li peng it noted was the adopted son of the late chou 
enlai peoples liberation army chief of staff chi haotian is 
president yang shangkuns soninlaw senior leader deng xiaopings 
son deng pufang formerly headed a business concern that has been 
accused of shady dealings 
a recent survey of 10000 workers indicated corruption is 
regarded as chinas most serious problem fortysix percent listed 
corruption as chinas most serious social problem and 63 percent 
said improper deeds by party members is a major political problem 
the government has acknowledged its shortcomings and tried to 
crack down 
all malpractices such as corruption embezzlement or 
misappropriation of public funds and the squandering of funds 
allocated for helping poor people or doing relief work have 
seriously harmed the interests of the state and distorted the image 
of the party the official party paper peoples daily said 
chinese courts handled 37000 cases of official profiteering 
last year up 50 percent from 1987 and 101 embezzlers and 
bribetakers were sentenced to death or life imprisonment 
local governments have set up neighborhood corruption centers 
where ordinary people can report official abuses of power without 
fear of recrimination 
but as the hundreds of banners on central tiananmen square 
reading down with corruption attest the government has made 
little headway in rooting out this deeply ingrained problem

car buyers should avoid purchasing the ford 
bronco ii because two of its wheels leave the ground during 
accidentavoidance tests according to consumer reports 
in its june issue consumer reports said the sportutility car 
handled poorly though deeming it better handling than the suzuki 
samurai which the magazine said last june rated not acceptable 
the magazines tests showed that the samurai had a greater 
propensity to roll over than the bronco ii but statistics compiled 
by the national highway traffic safety administration indicate that 
fatal rollover accidents are much higher with the bronco ii it 
said 
ford disputes that conclusion 
the magazine said that federal statistics on deaths in rollovers 
in 1987 indicated there were 19 fatal rollovers for every 100000 
bronco iis compared with six per 100000 in samurais 
the magazine while critical of the bronco iis handling 
emphasized that the ford vehicles behavior was still a far cry 
from the not acceptable performance of the suzuki samurai 
considering the bronco iis rollover fatality record in 
combination with its poor emergency handling and considering the 
wide availability of similar vehicles with better handling and 
better accident statistics we think its wise to avoid the bronco 
ii the magazine said 
ford has challenged the federal death statistics saying they 
are misleading because only accidents involving 1986 and 1987 
models were counted 
the automaker has argued that results would be in line with 
other vehicles of the same type if all accidents were counted since 
introduction of the bronco ii in 1983 
the automaker also challenged the validity of what it called a 
single driverinfluenced test in which the drivers input can 
cause a vehicle to pass or fail 
ford said in a comparable accident avoidance maneuver conducted 
for the automaker the bronco ii did not lift even one wheel off 
the ground 
ford said the bronco ii is a safe vehicle when it is driven 
according to commonsense safe driving practices 
the magazine however said that when its test drivers began 
steering around an obstacle the bronco iis inside front wheel 
lifted off the ground 
it said the inside rear wheel also lifted off the ground during 
runs through the course at speeds of 42 mph 
as with the samurai last year the bronco iis were fitted with 
outriggers to prevent rolling over said consumer union the 
magazines publisher 
in all the test runs drivers were able to get the bronco iis 
back down and finish the course the magazine said 
at no time did the bronco ii come close to rolling completely 
up onto the safety outriggers it said in identical maneuvers 
conducted last year the samurai lifted both wheels quickly 
rolling completely up onto the safety outriggers 
suzuki denied that its car was unstable but samurai sales 
plunged after the magazine article last year the car then made a 
strong comeback when suzuki reduced its price

two federal drug agents who thought they had 
developed a scheme to take money from drug traffickers found 
themselves targeted by an elaborate sting authorities said 
federal investigators said they caught the two longtime drug 
enforcement administration agents with help from a confidential 
informant who posed as a drug trafficker 
the arrests came five weeks after another miamibased dea agent 
was arrested on drugs charges 
agents drew bunnell and al iglesias didnt know the man was 
taking orders from the deas own internal investigation unit 
according to tom cash the deas special agent in charge in miami 
bunnell and iglesias appeared wednesday before federal 
magistrate both were charged with bribery a felony punishable by 
up to five years in prison 
bunnell assigned to the dea office in ecuador was ordered held 
without bond pending a full hearing monday his arraignment was 
scheduled for may 30 
iglesias of the deas miami office was ordered released on a 
500000 personal surety bond his arraignment was set for june 6 
the informant told each agent he had a large sum of money given 
to him by drug traffickers and that the money was to be used to 
buy and transport cocaine into the united states cash said 
proper procedure would require agents in possession of this 
information to immediately open an investigation and conduct a 
reverse sting operation to arrest the traffickers cash said 
instead he said the two agents told the informant that they 
would not investigate if they could keep the money in return 
iglesias and bunnel allegedly promised to protect the informant 
against retaliation 
bunnell had nine years experience with the dea and iglesias 14 
officials said 
bunnell was arrested near miami international airport and 
iglesias was arrested at his miami home said michael a pavlick a 
senior dea inspector in washington 
both agents were placed on administrative leave with pay cash 
said 
authorities said the investigation began in july 1988 when the 
confidential informant told the dea he had met with bunnell in 
december 1987 and discussed stealing cocaine money 
the dea then began monitoring telephone calls between the 
informant and bunnell authorities said the informant led bunnell 
to believe he had taken 215000 in cocaine traffickers money 
authorities said 
bunnell received 7000 before his arrest but had expected to 
get 100000 authorities said the informant also gave bunnells 
wife 5000 authorities said 
iglesias got 700 in cash and an 11000 rolex presidential 
wristwatch purchased from funds which iglesias believed were 
taken from the drug traffickers cash said 
in the previous arrest agent jorge villar was arrested in 
midapril on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and 
conspiring to commit bribery he was arrested with a former 
metrodade police officer

the official tass news agency waited until 
president mikhail s gorbachev left beijing today to report that 
police in chinas capital confronted by more than 1 million 
demonstrators had lost control 
as gorbachev spoke at a news conference in beijing on wednesday 
armies of protesters filled the streets to demand democratic 
reforms the rallies spread to at least 20 provincial capitals 
including shanghai where gorbachev traveled today to end his 
fourday trip 
the giant demonstrations the largest show of defiance in 
communist chinas 40 years made headlines worldwide as they 
disrupted gorbachevs meetings with top chinese leaders the first 
sovietchinese summit in three decades 
however a 45minute report on the soviet evening television 
news program vremya on wednesday on gorbachevs trip made no 
mention of the protests instead shoring him strolling along the 
great wall and joking with young people about chinese cooking 
with gorbachev in shanghai today tass began reporting in detail 
on the demonstrations saying that in beijing police do not take 
any measures to restore order in the streets and authorities have 
in effect lost control over the situation 
continuing the neutral line espoused by gorbachev on the 
demonstrators and their demands tass reported without comment that 
protesters supported students on a hunger strike and were demanding 
the resignation of some of chinas leaders 
gorbachev said wednesday in beijing that a difficult painful 
but political dialogue is going on between the leadership youth 
and public concerning these events and it seems to me that we 
should welcome that fact 
since gorbachev came to power in march 1985 there have been 
numerous demonstrations in the soviet union including nationalist 
protests in armenia that have assembled hundreds of thousands of 
people but their scale was dwarfed by the rallies in china 
traffic on the citys main streets is paralyzed tass 
reported from beijing out of all central newspapers only the 
peoples daily the organ of the central committee of the communist 
party of china was delivered to subscribers

a former federal prosecutor formally announced 
his candidacy for mayor by promising to combat violent crime on the 
citys streets and corruption in its offices 
in announcing his bid for the republican ticket wednesday 
rudolph w giuliani stressed his 5 years as us attorney in 
manhattan a post he left in january 
he said none of his rivals understands the justice system and 
the criminal justice system in particular the way i do 
giuliani 44 said he would hire more police increase jail 
capacity and seek to reform the juvenile justice system to handle 
increased arrests he would add court space and prosecutors 
now is the time to take back our city from the violent 
criminals on the streets and the whitecollar criminals in their 
office suites from the drug dealers in abandoned buildings and the 
crooked politicians who have abandoned their oath of office he 
said 
giuliani who won a racketeering conviction of once powerful 
democratic boss stanley friedman said he would make the 
elimination of corruption in city government a priority 
as a gop hopeful running in a city where registered democrats 
outnumber republicans 51 giuliani compared himself to fiorello 
laguardia another italianamerican and republican who faced 
similar odds when he won the mayoralty in 1933 
giuliani pledged that he like laguardia would kick out an 
old tired and corrupt administration and restore to new york 
honest decent and effective government 
polls have shown giuliani would defeat mayor edward i koch 
manhattan borough president david dinkins former metropolitan 
transportation authority chairman richard ravitch and city 
comptroller harrison goldin the first three have declared their 
candidacy for the democratic nomination goldins formal 
announcement is expected next week 
koch said he is not discouraged by the polls because he is 
confident that his 12year tenure as mayor will attract voters he 
said giuliani knows nothing about government 
giulianis first hurdle is the republican primary in september 
when he faces a wellfinanced challenge from the cosmetics heir 
ronald lauder 
last month giuliani won the endorsement of the citys liberal 
party to assure himself a place on the november ballot the citys 
last republican mayor john v lindsay did the same

the interior department announced a years 
postponement of a gulf of alaska oil lease sale because of 
environmental concerns even though state officials said a sale 
there posed little risk 
a spokesman for alaska gov steve cowper urged the federal 
agency to reconsider a lease sale in bristol bay the states 
richest fishing area because the state believes it poses a much 
greater potential ecological danger 
interior secretary manuel lujan jr said wednesday the gulf sale 
proposed for august 1990 in an area known as lease sale 114 was 
delayed because additional time is needed to assess damage from the 
exxon oil spill in prince william sound the tanker exxon valdez 
hit a reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into 
the sound march 24 
terence omalley cowpers spokesman called the delay 
probably a good idea in light of prince william sound 
however since theres probably not that great of a chance of oil 
being discovered there the risk is minimal 
alaska authorities want the interior department to reconsider 
its bristol bay lease sale where the risks of a catastrophic oil 
spills are much greater omalley said 
drilling has not started there but nine oil companies last year 
paid the federal government 95 million for the right to explore 
for oil and gas 
the state went to court to block the leases but lost before the 
9th us circuit court of appeals it plans an appeal to the us 
supreme court if congress or the bush administration doesnt buy 
back the leases 
the environmental assessment for the gulf sale had been 
scheduled for publication in september if the interior department 
decides next year to go ahead with a new review additional public 
comment will be sought 
lujan said interior officials will work closely with cowper and 
local communities 
the los angeles times on wednesday quoted lujan aide steve 
goldstein as saying the decision should not be read as a 
cancellation of the lease project this is a postponement to 
gather information while new facts are coming to light 
another aide mark stephenson in washington dc said that the 
delay should take about a year because it will take that long to 
evaluate the valdez spill impact 
lujans official announcement came at the start of the interior 
chiefs western tour with an itinerary including the golden gate 
national recreation area headquarters the presidio army base near 
the golden gate bridge yosemite national park las vegas the fort 
irwin national training center and a meeting with california gov

prosecutors today searched the homes and offices of 
two members of parliament suspected of taking bribes in an 
influencepeddling scandal that has generated a national leadership 
crisis 
also today officials of the ruling and opposition parties 
agreed to summon former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone to testify 
under oath in parliament next wednesday about his links to the 
scandal 
the opposition has been boycotting lower house sessions to 
demand testimony by nakasone who was prime minister at the time of 
dubious stock deals including some purchases by his own aides 
the opposition position stiffened after the governing party 
rammed the fiscal 1989 budget through the lower house in its 
absence on april 28 
the tokyo district public prosecutors office searched various 
offices and residences of the two legislators takao fujinami 56 
and katsuya ikeda 51 who on wednesday became the first elected 
officials to be interrogated as suspects in the scandal 
prosecutors again summoned the two for questioning today 
according to japanese legal custom summoning politicians for 
interrogation is regarded as the equivalent of an arrest japanese 
law protects lawmakers from being jailed when parliament is in 
session 
because prosecutors are required to disclose their suspicions to 
obtain special permission from parliament to arrest lawmakers they 
routinely delay pressing formal charges until completing repeated 
summonses and interrogation 
prosecutors are expected soon to press formal charges the 
equivalent of an indictment against fujinami and ikeda 
ikeda former secretary general of the opposition komeito clean 
government party and fujinami of the governing liberal 
democratic party are suspected of receiving bribes from the 
recruit co information conglomerate in exchange for using their 
political clout to help the firm 
fujinami an eightterm member of the house of representatives 
was chief cabinet secretary under nakasone he once was considered 
a rising star in the liberal democratic party 
fujinami has acknowledged an aide in 1986 bought 12000 shares 
in recruitcosmos co a property subsidiary of recruit at a 
discounted price before the companys stock was publicly traded 
the transaction brought profits of about 191000 
ikeda a former journalist and fourterm member of the house of 
representatives was also involved in a purchase of recruit cosmos 
shares through his brother yuzuru who bought 5000 shares in the 
firm and gained about 73530 from the transaction 
in both cases the politicians denied personal involvement in 
the transactions although it was later disclosed that the bulk of 
the profits went into their bank accounts 
ikeda said tuesday that he planned to resign his parliament 
seat governing party officials denied reports that fujinami also 
would resign but they indicated he might have to do so if formally 
charged 
komeito chairman junya yano became the third party leader to 
step down in the recruit scandal on wednesday 
he follows prime minister noboru takeshita who is resigning as 
head of the liberal democratic party and thus as prime minister 
and saburo tsukamoto who stepped down in february as head of the 
opposition democratic socialist party 
governing party leaders still are trying to find someone 
untainted by the scandal who is suitable to be the new prime 
minister 
some 160 politicians bureaucrats and businessmen bought 
bargainpriced unlisted shares in a recruit subsidiary and made 
large profits when the price soared after public trading began 
of 17 politicians linked to purchases of recruit shares 11 were 
members of the cabinet of nakasone who was prime minister at the 
time of the share transactions

the white house pentagon and other 
governmental agencies have suffered televisions bite but the fbi 
has enjoyed broadcasting bliss and the agencys director wants it 
to stay that way 
in a speech before several hundred television producers fbi 
director william sessions urged them wednesday to continue their 
largely favorable depiction of the bureau 
fbi stories are very much a part of television history 
sessions said i would like to think that future fbi chronicles 
on television might reflect current issues and crime problems 
that the fbi faces in the closing years of the 20th century 
sessions enthusiastically recounted the fbis successful 
investigation of the chicago gang el rukns sprinkling his account 
with colorful images of an omnipotent and clever fbi 
encouraging the producers to make more fbioriented programs 
sessions said our investigations of the last 10 years i 
believe are more intriguing and have more intriguing facets than 
ever before 
sessions specifically thanked the makers of nbcs unsolved 
mysteries and the fox broadcasting corps americas most 
wanted 
he said both programs seeking tips on current lawenforcement 
investigations help to demonstrate the depth of the 
responsibility of the fbi i would say the portrayal on these 
shows gives a sense to the american public of the difficulties we 
face in trying to bring these people back 
one of the most successful tv series was the fbi on abc 
from 1965 to 1974 the show starred efrem zimbalist jr as the 
inspector lewis erskine and the show never failed to portray the 
fbi in anything but a glowing light 
former fbi director j edgar hoover gave the fbi full 
cooperation and opened up the agencys headquarters for occasional 
filming of background scenes many episodes concluded with requests 
for information on the fbis mostwanted list including a 1968 
appeal for martin luther king assassin james earl ray 
the fbi was updated by abc in 1981 but todays 
fbi starring mike connors lasted less than a year the 
sequel also had the approval of the fbi which gave the shows 
makers real fbi files 
come fall nbc will have a new drama called mancuso fbi 
based on the courageous fbi agent seen in the networks miniseries 
favorite son 
mancuso played by robert loggia was portrayed as a 
tossoutthebook maverick marking time for his retirement when 
politically motivated fbi bosses gave him an impossible assignment 
because they were sure he would fail 
the fbi had no consulting role in the miniseries and if the 
character stays true to form in the weekly series still in the 
development stage the fbi can be expected to reject any 
involvement

scattered damage was reported throughout southern and central 
luzon the main philippine island 
philippine airlines canceled 50 domestic flights and the coast 
guard prevented at least six ships from leaving the port of manila

southeastern luzon and to parts of the central visayas islands 
which bore the brunt of the storm

this afternoon heading toward china at 9 mph and packing peak winds

a surprise state budget surplus has raised 
hopes for an end to a fourdayold teachers strike that has 
crippled education for more than a halfmillion students in the 
nations secondlargest school district 
the state expects to receive an extra 25 billion in the next 
two years gov george deukmejian said wednesday as much as 228 
million of the surplus could go to the los angeles unified school 
district 
negotiators in the teachers strike planned to resume 
negotiations today 
the third day of the strike wednesday was marked by dwindling 
student attendance a report of a molotov cocktail thrown at a 
school and the arrest of a striking teacher who allegedly hit a 
substitute teacher with a picket sign 
although educators had expected some kind of state budget 
windfall the size of the surplus came as a surprise to both sides 
in the teachers strike 
wayne johnson president of united teacherslos angeles reacted 
to the news by changing the unions pay demand from a 21 percent 
raise over two years to 26 percent raise over three years 
this is very good news johnson said if they dont want 
to settle with us now they just want to break the union 
but the district offered no change in its offer of a 215 
percent raise over three years citing the findings of a state 
factfinders report released wednesday the report said the 
teachers should accept the districts proposal as fair and 
reasonable 
board of education president roberta weintraub said the report 
totally exonerates the board of education and i urge each and 
every teacher to go back to work 
the report was prepared by attorney geraldine randall who began 
investigating the dispute last march when the 16month contract 
negotiation reached an impasse 
she was selected jointly by the district and the teachers 
union but johnson dismissed the findings as biased against 
teachers 
after the governors announcement ms weintraub said a meeting 
had been called between district and teachers union officials at 
issue is how much money the district should expect to receive out 
of the surplus 
a ballot measure passed in november requires the state to give 
schools virtually all revenue over a set spending limit but 
lawmakers have indicated they may try to send more of the excess 
funds to other areas 
more than 250000 of the districts 594000 students skipped 
school in the nations secondlargest school district wednesday 
the teachers union said 23000 teachers counselors nurses and 
librarians were honoring the picket lines striking teachers 
account for almost twothirds of the districts 32000member 
teaching work force 
the district said about 8200 teachers came to work wednesday 
about 3000 fewer teachers than the approximately 11250 who 
reported to work tuesday 
about 12250 teachers came to work the first day of the strike 
security was beefed up at hollenbeck junior high school on 
wednesday after three molotov cocktail firebombs were thrown at the 
school overnight nobody was injured and the school suffered only 
superficial damage

a city councilor has proposed that college 
students who comprise 20 percent of bostons population but dont 
pay taxes pay a 5 monthly levy to support the financially 
crunched public library 
making students pay for city services is an old idea gaining new 
luster because of the specter of slashed budgets 
sixty dollars a year isnt going to make them broke when 
theyre spending up to 20000 a year to go to some of these fancy 
schools we have in boston said councilor christopher a 
iannella we have great research facilities and those students 
dont pay a cent 
all proceeds would go to the boston public library which is 
planning to lay off up to 120 employees and close its 25 branch 
libraries four days a week when the city slashes its budget by more 
than 1 million next year 
boston is host to 32 colleges and universities with an estimated 
120000 students but half of its real estate is taxexempt because 
it belongs to universities hospitals or other nonprofit

a militant sinhalese group blamed for 
more than 2500 killings this year will begin a unilateral 
ceasefire a statement bearing the organizations name said today 
the ceasefire by the peoples liberation front is scheduled to 
last one week beginning midnight friday coinciding with the 
sinhalese vesak festival that commemorates the birth enlightenment 
and death of buddha 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of sri lankas population of 16 
million and are predominantly buddhist 
the ultranationalist organization claims a government peace 
accord gave too many concessions to tamils a mainly hindu minority 
seeking autonomy in the northern and eastern areas of this island 
nation it also claims the presence of indian troops sent to 
enforce the accord undermines sri lankas sovereignty 
the sinhaleselanguage statement delivered to newspaper and 
news agency offices said its followers will defend themselves if 
attacked but will not initiate any confrontations 
a sri lankan military spokesman declined comment on the 
ceasefire statement there was no official communication the 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the government has blamed the front for the deaths of more than 
3500 people mostly of sinhalese government workers officials and 
police informers since the peace agreement was signed in july 1987 
tamil militants initially supported the accord that gave them 
some autonomy but they later reneged and refused to hand over 
arms they have since waged a protracted guerrilla war with indian 
troops the militants launched their bloody insurgency in 1983 
india became involved because of the sympathies of its 60 
million politically powerful tamils in south india for their fellow 
tamils in sri lanka who make up 17 percent of the islands 
population 
more than 12500 people have been killed in sri lanka since the 
ethnic warfare began nationwide in 1983 
in april president ranasinghe premadasas government offered 
sinhalese and tamil militants a peace package that included seats 
in parliament and employment tamil guerrillas opened talks with 
the government but the sinhalese extremists did not accept the 
offer

the two sides agreed that the sinosoviet highlevel meeting 
symbolized the normalization of relations between the two 
countries this is in conformity with the interests and aspirations 
of the chinese and soviet peoples and contributes to the 
maintenance of world peace and stability the normalization of 
sinosoviet relations is not directed at any third country nor 
does it harm its interests 
china and the soviet union had an overall and indepth 
exchange of views on the settlement of the kampuchean cambodian 
question 
they shared the concern and considered it essential that no 
civil war in kampuchea should follow the complete vietnamese troop 
withdrawal and that future kampuchea should be an independent 
peaceful neutral and nonaligned state to this end they 
expressed support for national reconciliation with the 
participation of the four parties in kampuchea 
the chinese side advocated the establishment in kampuchea of a 
provisional quadripartite coalition government headed by cambodian 
resistance leader prince sihanouk during the transitional period 
after the complete vietnamese troop withdrawal and prior to the end 
of a general election 
the soviet side maintained that the internal problems of 
kampuchea including preparations for the general election under 
international supervision should be solved by the kampuchean 
people themselves 
they held that with the withdrawal of vietnamese troops from 
kampuchea the countries concerned should gradually reduce and 
eventually stop all their military aid to any of the parties in 
kampuchea 
the two sides agreed to take measures to cut down the military 
forces in the area along the sinosoviet boundary to a minimum 
level commensurate with the normal goodneighborly relations 
between the two countries

sinosoviet boundary question

country to impose its will on others or seek hegemony of any form 
anywhere in the world

an official of the national security council 
says the bush administration may seek renewed military aid to the 
contra rebels if nicaraguas sandinista government holds power by 
fraudulent means in next years election 
if it is perceived that they have stolen the election then 
our policy subsequently will reflect that nsc counselor peter 
rodman said wednesday to the privately financed commission on free 
and fair elections in nicaragua 
the wider this perception then the stronger consensus there 
will be for an appropriate policy afterward rodman said 
the official was asked his reaction to the testimony of senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas who told the commission on 
tuesday he would favor significant military aid to the 
usbacked contras if nicaraguan president daniel ortega fails to 
hold free elections as promised 
i have nothing to add to what was part of the bipartisan 
accord a couple of months ago that the administration does reserve 
the right to ask for such aid in the future if circumstances 
change he said 
thats not part of our present policy but the administration 
has not given away its future right to ask for such things if it 
seems appropriate he added 
the united states government provides nonlethal aid to the 
contra rebels in their fight to oust the marxistled nicaraguan 
government military aid was cut off last year 
asked by former sen gaylord nelson dwis commission 
cochairman what us policy would be if a fair election resulted 
in an ortega victory rodman replied i hesitate to prejudge 
everything we would do i think there is a presumption that if 
there is a fair election and we accept it as a fair election that 
makes a big difference in our attitude toward nicaragua and 
certainly our policy 
the commission established by the conservative world freedom 
foundation is made up of three democrats and three republicans 
carl gershman president of the national endowment for 
democracy a private grantmaking organization that receives an 
appropriation from congress testified that the nicaraguan election 
process will not work and indeed will be a farce if there is 
not concerted effort by the central american presidents and by 
others who are concerned about the situation to insist upon fair 
rules 
so far the fear is that there have been certain cosmetic 
steps that have been taken perhaps to improve the standing of the 
government in europe and elsewhere but that there has not been any 
real effort to sit down and establish an agreement gershman 
said unless there is agreement on rules it will undermine the 
legitimacy of the whole process 
elections are to be held in nicaragua next february under a 
regional peace plan that managua made with the neighboring 
governments of costa rica el salvador guatemala and honduras 
paul s reichler of washington an attorney for the nicaraguan 
government who said he was speaking only for himself said he 
believes the sandinistas will win the election if they do not he 
said he believes they will turn over power to whoever does

mikhail s gorbachev today ended a summit that 
broke down the barriers of 30 years of hostility between the soviet 
union and china and was further dramatized by huge prodemocracy 
protests 
the soviet leader and his wife raisa left shanghai to end what 
gorbachev called a visit of epochmaking significance the 
soviet news agency tass quoted gorbachev as calling the summit a 
watershed event 
a joint communique said neither side would seek hegemony of 
any form in any part of the world china has long accused moscow 
of trying to dominate weaker nations 
the communique issued after gorbachev left said normalization 
of relations contributes to the maintenance of world peace and 
stability 
it contained a lengthy section on cambodia with the two sides 
expressing different opinions on the conflict that has been the 
main obstacle to improved sinosoviet ties 
china repeated its support for a provisional government led by 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk and including both the 
threeparty resistance and the vietnambacked hun sen faction 
the soviet union which supports vietnam in its 10year war with 
the chinabacked resistance said only that internal problems 
including preparation for general elections under international 
supervision should be solved by the cambodians 
the two sides agreed that with vietnams withdrawal slated for 
september civil war should be avoided and outside parties should 
gradually end military aid to the warring factions 
the communique said the two sides agreed to take measures to cut 
down troops along their border to a minimum level commensurate 
with the normal good neighborly relations between the two 
countries 
during the visit gorbachev called for demilitarization of the 
countries border now guarded by 600000 soviet and 1 million 
chinese troops the countries fought a brief war along the border 
in 1969 he also suggested regular military consultations such as 
the soviet union has with the united states 
the communique upgraded talks on territorial disputes to the 
foreign minister level 
it made clear that the normalization of sinosoviet relations 
is not directed at any third country the united states in the 
past has benefited strategically from the sinosoviet rift but it 
has welcomed their rapprochement as contributing to regional and 
world stability 
the summit was the first meeting of chinese and soviet leaders 
since a hostile encounter between mao tsetung and nikita 
khrushchev in 1959 
gorbachevs fivehour trip to shanghai today was a respite from 
official meetings and from scheduled events that repeatedly were 
disrupted by demonstrators demanding political reform 
in shanghai gorbachev met with communist party chief jiang 
zemin and mayor zhu rongji and laid a wreath at a monument to the 
russian poet alexander pushkin 
he also toured the minhang special economic zone one of chinas 
areas set aside for foreign investment the soviet union is trying 
to set up similar areas as it embarks on economic reform 
as gorbachev left beijing crowds of factory workers government 
officials and students streamed into the city center in a show of 
support for students on a hunger strike for democracy on 
wednesday more than 1 million protesters marched through beijings 
tiananmen square to show support for the prodemocracy campaign 
thousands also took to the streets of shanghai and at least 20 
other cities to support the students 
gorbachev whom student protesters have praised for the 
political reforms he has championed at home on wednesday said that 
a difficult painful but political dialogue is going on between 
the leadership the youth and the public concerning these events 
and it seems to me that we should welcome that fact 
chinas leaders have over the past decade introduced freemarket 
reforms that have stimulated the economy but have resisted 
political liberalization of the sort gorbachev has encouraged in 
the soviet union 
the soviet leader said he had received a very warm letter 
from students that endorsed his reforms which have included the 
countrys first contested elections in 71 years he had received a 
petition signed by 6000 students 
some have been fasting since saturday in the latest tactic of a 
monthlong campaign to press the government for reforms including 
press freedom and a crackdown on official corruption 
at his wednesday news conference gorbachev defended socialist 
countries experiencing unrest as they attempt to make reforms 
if anyone thinks this will lead us to the ash heap of history 
i think they will be disappointed again he said 
earlier in a nationally televised interview gorbachev said his 
summit with chinese leaders went well

tens of thousands of protesters 
beating drums and chanting slogans marched today on the anniversary 
of a bloody 1980 uprising to demand the overthrow of president roh 
taewoo 
about 60000 students townspeople and opposition supporters 
gathered in southeastern kwangju to denounce roh and the united 
states for suppressing the 1980 kwangju rebellion in which at least 
192 people died 
eight effigies representing roh and seven other senior generals 
who commanded the army were burned as the crowd cheered and raised 
clinched fists in the provincial capital 170 miles southwest of 
seoul 
in seoul and seven other cities thousands of people also took 
part in marches protests and religious services 
thousands of riot police were deployed in central seoul to block 
protests police chased bands of students who ran through the 
streets shouting slogans such as punish roh taewoo and 
drive out the yankee imperialists 
in kwangju opposition leader kim daejung said rightwing 
forces were plotting to reimpose authoritarian rule in south korea 
we must remain alert to crush them and inherit the spirit of 
kwangju kim said in the message read to the crowd 
all protests were peaceful except in southern chonju where 
radical students hurling firebombs attacked offices of the 
governing democratic justice party police said there were no 
injuries 
dissident groups had called for peaceful protests to mark the 
anniversary of the uprising that began may 18 1980 in kwangju 
past anniversaries were marked by violence 
it was the first time the government permitted a demonstration 
in kwangju to mark the uprising hundreds of riot police stayed out 
of sight inside the government headquarters while the huge crowd 
demonstrated in the square before the government building 
earlier 20000 people visited the cemetery outside kwangju 
where many of those killed in the nineday uprising are buried 
mourners prayed and bowed before the graves as funeral music blared 
over loud speakers and students pounded drums 
mourners lit a gasolinedrenched figure made of cloth about six 
feet high with a top hat decorated with the us stars and stripes 
and rohs face 
punish roh taewoo and get out american imperialists 
people yelled as thick smoke swirled up from the blazing effigy 
dissident groups called for rohs resignation and the expulsion 
of the 43000 us troops based in south korea they claim 
washington has helped to keep roh and past authoritarian 
governments in power 
crowds of students townspeople opposition politicians and 
others hiked to the cemetery in the hills outside kwangju elderly 
mothers dressed in long traditional white mourning robes sobbed 
and cried hysterically in front of the graves of sons killed in the 
uprising 
my son my son sobbed one woman 
other mourners placed fruit and drinks on the graves and burned 
scented candles to honor the dead pictures of the dead mostly 
young students were placed in front of many of the graves 
columns of radical students carried red blue and yellow flags 
banners depicted enraged people with rifles fighting soldiers 
antigovernment sentiment in kwangju a traditional opposition 
stronghold has been inflamed by the death earlier this month of a 
radical student dissidents allege police killed lee cholkyu 
whose body was found in a reservoir near kwangju may 10 
roh was a senior army general when townspeople and students 
seized a government armory in kwangju on may 18 1980 and took 
control of the city until troops were sent in to end the uprising 
government reports said 192 people were killed and hundreds 
injured opposition groups claim the government covered up many 
more deaths 
south korea has been hit by waves of violent antigovernment 
protests and labor strikes in recent months dissidents and radical 
students have been calling for the overthrow of the roh government 
but they lack public support because of their violent tactics and 
extremist views

president bush promises to veto faster than 
the eye can see a raise in the minimum wage and republican 
lawmakers are justifiably confident bush will win his first 
domesticpolicy clash with capitol hills majority democrats 
there are enough votes in the senate to support a presidential 
veto senate republican leader bob dole said wednesday before the 
senate gave 6337 approval to legislation increasing the minimum 
wage for the first time in eight years 
doles prediction was borne out moments later the final vote 
was four votes short of the margin that would be required to enact 
the bill over a bush veto 
labor secretary elizabeth dole joined her husband in accusing 
democrats of picking a political fight with bush instead of 
accepting the presidents proposal and assuring nearly 4 million 
minimumwage workers a pay raise 
congress just frittered away another and the last chance to 
increase the minimum wage this year mrs dole said the 
president will be forced to veto their unacceptable package and 
everyone loses 
democrats pushing the measure vowed nonetheless to press their 
case with the president and while refusing to concede defeat in 
advance said they would advance another bill if bushs first veto 
is sustained 
we want to make it very clear this fight is not going to go 
away and we are going to continue the battle until we get a fair 
and justified increase in the minimum wage sen edward m 
kennedy dmass said after the vote 
moments later bush who before the vote had said a veto was 
going to be inevitable made clear he meant it 
when the bill reaches the white house bush will veto it 
instantly faster than the eye can see presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
the president apparently wont get that chance until after 
congress returns from a 10day recess that begins friday 
the democratic leadership does not want to send the bill to the 
white house immediately which would allow bush to veto it while 
most members of congress are away from washington the delay also 
will allow time for what the democrats hope will emerge 
widespread public opposition to bushs position 
the showdown over the minimum wage has been looming since 
congress convened in january and has taken on symbolic significance 
as the determinant in whether congressional democrats or bush will 
hold the upper hand in setting domestic policy 
democrats have seemed as eager as bush for the confrontation 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine insisted 
wednesday that the minimum wage was the wrong issue for that fight 
he really isnt standing up to congress hes standing on the 
necks and backs of the working poor of this country mitchell 
said the president has a perceived political need to look tough 
to veto a bill we hope the american people will persuade him this 
is not the issue 
the 6337 senate vote approved a plan to boost the hourly 
minimum wage from 335 an hour to 455 by october 1991 it also 
would allow employers to pay a subminimum wage to workers with less 
than 60 days total work experience 
bush following through on a campaign promise had proposed 
raising the floor wage to 425 by january 1992 but only if 
employers could pay a subminimum to all new employees for six 
months regardless of their prior work experience the president has 
said that provision is necessary to offset potential job losses 
but democrats have assailed it as a means of allowing employers to 
avoid paying the higher minimum wage 
even though it appears bush will win the veto battle just 
getting a minimumwage bill out of congress was a symbolic victory

in a new crackdown the army will require 
residents of the occupied gaza strip to have special permits to 
enter israel and may extend the restrictions to palestinians in the 
west bank a military official said today 
the unprecedented measure affecting 700000 people came a 
day after parliament approved prime minister yitzhak shamirs peace 
plan calling for elections in the occupied lands to choose 
palestinian delegates for autonomy talks with israel 
also today an 18yearold palestinian from the west bank 
refugee camp of dheishe died eight days after being shot in the 
head during a clash with troops the army said arab hospital 
officials identified him as ali zghari 
the death brought to 482 the number of palestinians killed since 
the december 1987 start of the palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation twentyone israelis have also been slain 
at least 14 palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with 
soldiers in the west bank and gaza strip today arab reports and 
hospital officials said 
one was a 13yearold boy listed in critical condition in 
tulkarem hospital with a wound in the chest he was shot at the 
west banks tulkarem refugee camp where soldiers fired on youths 
defying a curfew in effect for five days according to arab reports 
much of the west bank and gaza strip were shut down by a general 
strike called by the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas or 
zeal to protest israeli interference with mosques 
the army which imposed a general curfew on the gaza strip on 
monday lifted the restrictions in gaza city and several other 
areas today but continued to bar all gazans from entering israel 
on tuesday authorities forced all gazans still in israel to return 
to their homes 
the closure and the permit requirements are part of a new army 
crackdown on the uprising in the west bank home to 1 million 
palestinians troops have resumed arrest raids in isolated arab 
villages a practice that led to many casualties and was abandoned 
for several months 
the new permits will improve our ability of supervising the 
entry of palestinians from the occupied territories to israel 
said the military official speaking on condition of anonymity 
defense minister yitzhak rabin indicated that palestinians 
active in the uprising would be denied permits 
we distinguish between those palestinians who would like to 
continue their lives in a normal way regardless of what political 
views or political aspirations they may have and those who 
participate in violence he told the jerusalem post newspaper 
rabin said the peace initiative and crackdown were part of the 
same policy the palestine liberation organization and many 
prominent palestinians in the occupied territories have rejected 
shamirs peace plan because it does not provide for eventual 
palestinian statehood 
rabin said the new restrictions were meant to send a clear 
message to the palestinians forget about bringing about any 
changes in the political initiative through stones or firebombs 
the military official said palestinians convicted of serious 
crimes such as murder or armed robbery would also be barred from 
israel but that details were still being worked out 
officials said 28000 palestinians have been convicted of crimes 
in israel in the past 10 years 
rabin said the army could start issuing permits by the end of 
may and expected the process to be completed within three months 
it was not immediately clear whether gazans would be confined to 
the gaza strip until all permits have been issued 
the closure will have the strongest affect on the 50000 gazans 
who work in israel and whose lowpaying jobs in farming 
construction and municipal services are their only source of 
income about 60000 west bank palestinians also work in israel 
in the past few days officials in several israeli cities have 
debated proposals to fire workers from the occupied lands and hire 
unemployed israelis for higher wages 
tel aviv mayor shlomo lahat said today that only companies whose 
employees are israeli citizens will get contracts for street 
cleaning currently most tel aviv street cleaners are gaza strip 
residents 
to take the residents from the territories and give them the 
work we the israelis dont want to do is unethical unhealthy 
lahat said on israel radio

bones around the womans left eye socket said dr robert s kurtz

teenage boys as she jogged through the park on the night of april 
19 she was comatose for nearly two weeks but has made slow 
progress since emerging from the coma including being able to name 
objects and helping to move herself from a stretcher to a bed 
the womans left eye had been pushed out of place when its bony 
supports were fractured kurtz said doctors put the ends of 
fractured bones together and used a small piece of bone from her

kurtz said the woman continued to have brainfunction problems and 
remained in serious condition

desperate and depressed people 
reaching out for help from a national suicide prevention hotline 
have been instead dialing the number of a wholesale craft supply 
business 
the calls are fraying the tempers of lavon davis and her two 
employees at house of france 
its very draining she said of trying to handle suicidal 
callers i dont know if its because of the calls but were all 
kind of on edge with each other rather irritable 
the calls apparently result from a mixup in which a national 
suicide prevention hotline somehow published the number for davis 
business 
we got a call today from a man who said he saw the number on 
channel 32 in miami davis said wednesday there is no commercial 
channel 32 in miami although the number is used by various cable 
companies 
we told him we would try to get help for him davis said 
the calls began about four weeks ago suicide prevention 
agencies in the grand rapids area have given davis their numbers to 
pass along to callers 
davis said changing her business number is unfeasible because of 
the potential of losing sales 
i just hope that nobody does anything in the meantime she 
said i guess its on all of our consciences every time the 
phone rings

a federal grand jury has indicted a 
california aerospace company on charges of selling substandard and 
defective bolts to nasa for use on the space shuttle 
the indictment wednesday accuses lee aerospace products inc of 
simi valley calif of defrauding the government by stating that 
the bolts were tested and met national aerospace standards 
the bolts were sold from august 1985 to september 1987 to usbi 
production company inc at cape canaveral air force station which 
used them in the assembly and refurbishing of solid rocket boosters 
on the space shuttle 
the indictment charges lee aerospace president darrell lee and 
vice president jerry martin with 34 counts of fraud and filing 
false statements on a government contract 
if convicted on each count lee and martin could face up to 170 
years in prison and 85 million in fines the corporation faces up 
to 17 million in fines and the possible loss of further government 
contracts 
the investigation into the aerospace company was disclosed in 
september after the bolts had been installed on the shuttle 
discovery nasa engineers said the bolts were not used in critical 
points on the shuttle and were not an immediate threat to flight 
safety 
most of the bolts anchored noncritical items such as cables and 
electrical boxes the boosters are held together by pins and the 
bolts are used to attach components to the boosters there are also 
numerous backup bolts if any of the bolts fail 
the two boosters used on discovery had 1209 bolts manufactured 
by lee about 60 percent of the 2000 bolts installed on the 
rockets 
analysis conducted last year at nasas marshall space flight 
center in huntsville ala found that 15 percent of the lee bolts 
sold to nasa did not meet required specifications bolts certified 
to withstand 17000 pounds of pressure per square inch failed at 
15000 pounds per square inch according to nasa officials 
it is not clear if lee aerospace manufactured or simply acted as 
a broker on the bolts in question 
an employee who answered the phone at lee aerospace wednesday 
said lee and martin were unavailable for comment the two are 
expected to be summoned before a us magistrate in orlando within 
the next few weeks

analysts cautiously predicted 
gains for moderates on both sides of the protestantcatholic divide 
today in northern irelands local election 
with returns in from 23 of the 98 wards a bbctv computer 
projection showed sinn fein backer of the irish republican army 
losing ground to the social democratic and labor party which 
opposes violence 
the bbc forecast 109 local council seats for the social 
democratic and labor party up 8 from the 1985 election and 57 for 
sinn fein down 2 it forecast 202 percent of the vote for the 
social democratic and labor party up from 178 percent and 121 
percent for sinn fein up from 118 percent 
in the protestant camp the bbc forecast 197 seats for the more 
moderate ulster unionist party up 7 and 109 for hardline rev 
ian paisleys democratic unionists down 33 
it gave the ulster unionist party also known as the official 
unionists 298 percent unchanged from 1985 and the democratic 
unionists 201 percent down from 243 percent 
altogether 566 seats were at stake on 26 councils although a 
few wards have postponed elections for a few days due to the death 
of candidates 
protestants outnumber catholics 32 in northern ireland and no 
significant change in the control of councils is expected 
seventeen of the outgoing councils are now controlled by 
protestants and the rest by catholics 
sinn feins vote looked solid in its belfast and londonderry 
strongholds but down in some rural areas 
recent bungled ira attacks which have claimed innocent lives may 
have been a factor in enniskillen where a misfired ira bomb 
killed 11 protestants in november 1987 sinn fein local leader paul 
corrigans vote fell from 2360 to 1781 a heavy setback in a 
sparsely populated rural district 
sinn fein saw its traditionally strong support in strabane 
falling 52 percent and in cookstown it was down 43 percent 
according to early results the social democratic and labor party 
was seen gaining about 2 percent in each district 
sinn fein insisted the ira blunders were not a campaign issue 
and blamed its losses on voter apathy it also blamed a government 
ban imposed last year on broadcast interviews with its members 
the ban which the government said was necessary to fight 
terrorism was waived during the latest election campaign and 
reimposed immediately after polling stations closed wednesday night 
analyzing the early sinn fein returns commentator colin 
macilhenny said on radio ulster in the really hardcore areas 
their vote is holding up in parts where theyre in direct 
competition with the sdlp their vote has crumbled 
tom kelly radio ulsters political correspondent said there 
does seem to be a trend of the sdlp gaining at the expense of sinn 
fein but also of sinn fein voters perhaps staying at home 
analyst paul arthur said on ulster tv that it was too early to 
draw conclusions 
a gain for the social democratic and labor party would be taken 
by the british and irish governments as vindicating the accord they 
signed in 1985 which gives dublin a say in the running of the 
province 
the accord aims to woo irish nationalists to the nonviolent 
social democratic and labor party and undercut sinn fein and the 
ira which is fighting to rid northern ireland of british rule and 
unite the province with the irish republic 
no overall turnout figure was available the final result is 
expected late friday 
one striking result was laurence kennedys victory in the 
affluent protestant ward of holywood near belfast 
kennedy ran as a conservative in a campaign to persuade prime 
minister margaret thatchers conservative party to enter northern 
ireland politics 
british parties have always preferred an armslength 
relationship with northern ireland giving the province limited 
selfrule and its own parties 
activists like kennedy say this perpetuated a sectarian divide 
instead of creating normal leftright politics and that the mold 
can only be broken by mainland parties entering the fray

the government newspaper today 
claimed the united states bribed the organization of american 
states to pass a resolution calling for a transfer of power in 
panama 
panamas de facto ruler gen manuel antonio noriega said in a 
radio interview that washingtons desire to get rid of him is 
racially motivated 
he also accused the us embassy in panama of misinforming 
president bush about the situation in panama since the may 7 
presidential election foreign observers say the opposition won the 
vote but the government declared the election void 
panama asks for respect it asks for freedom for its 
sovereignty the time of empires has ended why does the united 
states want an empire in panama why this is our only answer 
because we are black the general told wbai radio in new york in 
a telephone interview from panama 
his comments on wbais undercurrents program came after 
the oas unanimously approved a resolution wednesday night to send 
mediators to panama in an effort to bring about a transfer of power 
through democratic means 
the united states must change its attitude here in panama 
this is my message to your small radio station noriega said 
the government newspaper la critica contended that the united 
states promised to pay its debt to the oas of 50 million in 
exchange for the passage of the resolution 
it did not mention that panamas foreign minister jorge ritter 
supported sending in foreign ministers 
a commentator on the governments radio nacional said if the 
foreign ministers visit panama they must not come with the 
proposal that noriega leave because that is an internal panamanian 
affair 
the commentator rigoberto paredes said the ministers should 
come to discuss the war of aggression the united states is waging 
against us and the freeing of panamanian funds frozen in 
american banks last year 
paredes is an influential member of panamas national assembly 
and the former secretarygeneral of the militaryrun revolutionary 
democratic party 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since he was 
indicted last year in florida on federal drugtrafficking charges 
noriega denies the allegations and contends the united states wants 
him out so it can renege on the panama canal treaties which call 
for control of the waterway to be turned over to panama by 2000 
as head of the defense forces noriega also is the de facto 
ruler of panama 
the opposition called a general strike wednesday to press for 
his ouster but merchants say fear frustration and economic 
hardship caused it to fizzle 
half the capitals businesses remained open taxis and buses 
operated normally and the few demonstrations were small 
many businesses in panama are owned by foreigners and some 
owners said they feared problems with the government if they closed 
we were closed for two months last year and we got nothing out 
of it the crisis got worse said the owner of a furniture store 
in the capital 
im lucky if i make 7 a day last year when i closed for four 
days i lost my apartment said another merchant id close 
again if i thought it would make a difference 
leaders of panamas governmentcontrolled unions condemned the 
strike and taxi drivers said they were told they could lose their 
licenses if they did not work 
we are not fighters we are not going to go out into the 
streets and confront the police said a man sipping a soda in a 
small grocery store 
noriega is willing to die here hell have to be carried out 
of the barracks feet first an opposition supporter said glumly 
at san miguelito a poor section of town four women banged pots 
and tried to set up a barricade 
where are the men one woman was asked 
well she answered thats the problem 
i am not satisfied said second vice presidential opposition 
candidate guillermo ford i thought people would express their 
disatisfaction in a harsher way 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara however 
termed the action a total success 
endara and other opposition candidates were severely beaten by 
pronoriega thugs after the may 7 vote 
in an interview wednesday with frances antenne 2 network 
noriega alleged that the opposition itself brought about the 
beatings by provoking violence 
the police gave their protection to the candidates i have as 
proof that those who were injured were members of the police 
forces he said showing photographs of what apparently were 
hospitalized policemen 
ford appealed for the oas to take concrete steps to force 
noriega to recognize the opposition victory 
we just hope that the oas once and for all becomes what it was 
designed to be a protector of the latin american democracies and 
not just a place to have nice scotch and champagne he said

president mengistu haile mariam 
today faced the biggest challenge of his 15year marxist rule the 
reported defection of nearly half his army in the third day of an 
attempted coup 
the trouble came from warweary troops in the north who have 
been fighting rebels of the eritrean peoples liberation front 
after receiving word of the coup attempt mengistu cut short a 
state visit to east germany and returned wednesday night to addis 
ababa where loyal soldiers defeated mutinous troops in a battle in 
the capital 
the city was calm today but troops still guarded most key 
government buildings and the international airport remained closed 
at least two rebellious generals and the defense minister have 
been killed in the fighting but the total number of casualties was 
not known 
addis ababa state radio today urged people to return to work 
radio broadcasts from ethiopias secondlargest city the 
northern provincial capital of asmara declared the coup a success 
and urged the rest of the military to join the revolt 
soldiers backing the coup also were supported by secessionist 
rebels the troops have been fighting in the province the 
clandestine radio of the eritrean peoples liberation front 
declared today a twoweek ceasefire to facilitate the successful 
outcome of the military revolt that began tuesday 
voice of the eritrean masses the rebel radio said ethiopias 
2nd army a force of 150000 men has full control of asmara 
capital of the northernmost province of eritrea where the rebels 
hold threefourths of the countryside 
it said the rebels are discussing with army officers in asmara 
the best ways to intensify the struggle against the common 
enemy 
the rebellious soldiers commandeered a former government radio 
station in the city and broadcast in the name of the armed forces 
of eritrea 
they said they called on the rebels to join hands in 
ousting mengistu but it was not clear whether the rebels and 
soldiers had formed an alliance such an association would mean the 
government had lost control of the province ethiopias only access 
to the red sea 
the revolt began tuesday just hours after mengistu and his wife 
left for east berlin it was put down in the capital in 24 hours 
addis ababa state radio today announced the death of the defense 
minister maj gen haile giorgis habte mariam saying one of the 
plotters shot him repeatedly tuesday when he refused to join the 
coup attempt 
two rebellious officers also were killed tuesday maj gen 
merid negusie the chief of staff and the air force commander 
maj gen amha desta 
there were unconfirmed reports that a third coup leader maj 
gen kumalapchew dejene the deputy commander of the armed forces 
in eritrea was hunted down and killed by loyalist soldiers on 
wednesday 
state radio said another coup plotter was arrested industry 
minister fanta belai who used to command the air force 
mengistu inherited the 28yearold northern civil war when he 
and a clique of army officers deposed emperor haile selassie in a 
marxist revolution sept 12 1974 since then his biggest ally 
the soviet union has helped build the ethiopian army into africas 
biggest and best equipped though many troops are unwilling 
conscripts they have been fighting 30000 eritrean rebels and 
20000 insurgents who want more autonomy in neighboring tigre 
province 
persistent reports of military unrest in ethiopia cite 
warweariness among field commanders unhappy with the level of 
government support they are receiving in waging the war which is 
the oldest in africa 
eritrea is a former italian colony that was federated with 
ethiopia in 1957 under a ussponsored un resolution selassie 
annexed the territory in 1962

mary kay cosmetics says it has placed a moratorium 
on using laboratory animals to verify the safety of its products 
while it studies better methods of nonanimal product testing 
the announcement came wednesday by mary kay president richard c 
bartlett at an industry workshop at the johns hopkins center for 
alternatives to animal testing in baltimore 
our research shows that there is a great deal of consumer 
concern and confusion about the use of animals for safety testing 
for cosmetic toiletries household products all the way through 
medical research bartlett said 
mary kays imposition of a moratorium is part of a trend in the 
cosmetics business to develop alternative product safety testing 
methods that dont use animals 
avon products inc says it has not used animals for testing its 
beauty products since midmarch it has adopted one nonanimal 
testing procedure suitable for screening several types of avon 
products and is exploring additional replacements 
in january noxell corp maker of noxzema skin creams and cover 
girl cosmetics said it was screening many of its cosmetics by 
applying them to tissue cultures in laboratory dishes instead of 
injecting them into the eyes of rabbits 
many small cosmetics companies already shun the use of animals 
to test the safety of their products marketing their line chiefly 
to animal lovers 
bartlett said he recently became aware of an improved method of 
nonanimal testing and decided to put a moratorium on his companys 
use of animals until the usefulness of the newer tests is verified 
the new testing method being studied by mary kay would replace 
laboratory rats and mice with cells in a test tube a method 
developed at the baltimore center bartlett said 
since 1981 we have actively participated in the development 
of alternative testing methods bartlett said 
bartlett said the dallasbased company may have to hold up the 
release of some new products but the new technology may someday 
speed up product development mary kays products are not sold in 
stores but through individual sales agents

a state biologist rappelled down the 
side of a 23story office building and endured repeated attacks by 
two rare peregrine falcons to retrieve an egg from the birds nest 
the egg turned out to be infertile 
thomas french head of the states endandered species program 
dangled from two ropes wednesday while a small crowd gathered on 
the street hundreds of feet below and the adult birds attacked 
he reached the 21st floor ledge of monarch place where the 
endangered predators are raising two other chicks and sent the egg 
up to the roof in a can but after he rushed the egg to his conway 
home in hopes of incubating it thomas p ricardi a master 
falconer said it had no embryo inside 
my heart kind of sank ricardi said 
state officials said its not uncommon to find an infertile egg 
in young birds first nest but they decided to try the rescue 
after the egg did not hatch on schedule the first egg opened 
saturday and the second chick hatched monday 
if the egg had been fertile the chick would have been returned 
to the nest 
the adult birds are the first peregrine falcons to nest in 
western massachusetts in more than 40 years 
the state raised and released young falcons in boston and 
amherst in an attempt to restore a breeding population but the 
springfield falcons found their own way to the downtown office 
building last year the birds easily adapt to tall buildings in 
place of cliffs 
a leg band shows the female was released in toronto as part of 
the canadian governments falcon restoration efforts french said 
the male also is banded but officials havent yet determined his 
origin 
state biologists had to help a pair of boston falcons incubate 
their first eggs two years ago but they were able to use a 
longhandled net to retrieve the eggs from a ledge the net 
couldnt be used at monarch place because the highrise office 
buildings windows dont open officials said

israeli foreign minister moshe arens today 
sought support from us officials for a controversial israeli plan 
to hold elections among palestinians in the israelioccupied 
territories 
arens met with national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
defense secretary dick cheney he also was scheduled to explain 
details of the plan to secretary of state james a baker iii later 
in the day on friday he meets with vice president dan quayle and 
members of congress 
the united states has expressed qualified support for the plan 
we think that the shamir plan has some potential baker said 
in an interview wednesday on worldnet the television network of 
the us information agency we think the idea of elections 
cannot be seen as an end in and of themselves but that it would 
be helpful in moving toward peace he added 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir is seeking strong 
endorsement for the plan adopted by his cabinet on sunday both to 
satisfy hardline critics at home and to enlist support for it among 
moderate arab leaders 
shamir will travel to england and spain to campaign for the 
proposal which the palestine liberation organization has rejected 
because it excludes participation by its representatives and would 
be held under israeli occupation 
the blueprint calls for elections that would pick palestinians 
who would initially negotiate with israel over selfrule in the 
predominantly arab west bank and gaza strip 
the fiveyear autonomy period would be followed by negotiations 
to determine who should control the lands which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
shamir won reluctant israeli parliamentary approval for the plan 
wednesday but rightwing activists in his own likud party and 
other parties claimed it would pave the way for creation of a 
palestinian state 
arens speaking in a television interview said some critics 
believe israel should withstand international pressure to advance 
peace proposals until it has quelled the violent palestinian 
uprising in the territories 
in response to escalating attacks on israelis and growing public 
pressure the israeli government this week cracked down on 
palestinians from the gaza strip preventing them from traveling to 
work in israel and confining them to their homes more than 480 
palestinians have died in the uprising which began 17 months ago 
if the violence is to stop arens said the united states must 
help secure support for the israeli election plan among arab 
leaders the united states has a very crucial role to play at 
this stage arens said in the televised interview 
arens also said that the most important thing as far as were 
concerned is that nothing be done in order to strengthen the image 
of the terrorists of the plo because they will try to sabotage 
the initiative 
israel objects strongly to the contacts launched last year 
between washington and the plo contending they only serve to 
derail prospects for peace arens is expected to point to the plos 
rejection of the israeli plan as proof the organization does not 
want peace

for elections in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
saying it was an attempt to buy time 
the israeli blueprint avoids facing increasing world pressures 
to solve the palestinian problem in a just and durable way 
hussein said 
earlier this week the palestine liberation organization 
leadership also rejected the plan which excludes participation by 
plo members in a statement issued in tunisia earlier this week 
the plo leaders said they would not support elections under israeli 
occupation 
speaking at marka air base near amman hussein said this the 
plo decision is a palestinian move and i believe it is my duty and 
the duty of all our arab brethren to support it 
israels parliament the knesset on wednesday endorsed prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs plan which calls for the election of 
palestinian representatives to negotiate limited selfrule of the 
west bank and gaza strip under the plan palestinians would gain 
autonomy for five years then negotiate control of the territories 
that israel captured from jordan and egypt in 1967 
in his remarks today hussein reiterated that he does not speak 
on behalf of the palestinian people jordan ruled the west bank 
between 1950 and 1967 then maintained an active role speaking for 
the palestinians in international forums but last year hussein 
handed over that responsibility to the plo 
the israeli plan concerns the palestinian people and they 
have their leadership the plo under chairman yasser arafat 
hussein said 
the palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile 
last year proclaimed an independent palestinian state in the area 
that roughly covers the occupied territories 
arafat later recognized israels right to exist and renounced 
terrorism in a peace initiative that action led the united states 
to reverse a 13yearold policy by opening talks with the plo

the parliaments of the baltic republics of 
lithuania and estonia today began considering legislation that 
would give them greater economic independence from the federal 
government 
lithuanias supreme soviet declared the republic sovereign 
and considered a draft law that would allow lithuania to print its 
own currency an official in lithuanias foreign ministry said 
in estonia the proposal being debated included provisions for 
limited private property 
both republics plans would give them control over virtually all 
industry in their territory and declare them the sole masters of 
their natural resources 
the proposed laws conflict with recommendations from a moscow 
commission on how much freedom the soviet republics should have 
the commissions proposed law would leave control over energy 
and at least half of heavy industry as well as all defense 
production in the hands of moscow bureaucrats it also would 
prohibit republics from printing their own money 
the lithuanian parliament passed a law granting it general 
sovereignty by a large margin said geidrius cekuolis first 
secretary of the lithuanian foreign ministry the law specifies 
that national soviet laws are valid in lithuania only if approved 
by the lithuanian parliament effectively claiming the republic can 
veto kremlin decisions it does not like 
the estonian supreme soviet passed a similar law in november 
moscow authorities pronounced the law invalid but the estonian 
parliament stood by its decision and considers the sovereignty law 
in force 
the estonian draft law on the economy does not provide for 
separate currency but supreme soviet members debated that question 
today and it may end up in the law the estonian foreign ministry 
spokesman gondo olevsoo said in a telephone interview from 
tallinn estonias capital 
the draft laws section on private property says thatwithin 
limits set by the law smallscale private property is allowed 
in a similar vein the lithuanian law provides for the 
economically necessary introduction of plots of land for perpetual 
use with the right of inheritance 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has proposed leasing of up 
to 50 years or more but the communist party leadership has 
explicitly rejected private ownership which is antithetical to 
communist ideology 
both republics say the new laws on economic independence should 
come into force in 1990 
estonia claims full control over its land water air space 
forests and other natural resources in the law all industry 
except defenserelated factories are to be put under control of 
local authorities according to the law 
the lithuanian proposals provision on currency states that the 
republic can introduce its own money system with independent 
banks and that it can if necessary print its own state 
obligations stocks and other valuable papers 
latvia the third baltic republic is considering similar 
measures on economic independence

actor michael j fox has taken his revenge 
on the tabloid swat team that descended on his july 16 1988 
wedding at an inn here 
michael j foxs nuptials in hell in the june issue of 
esquire magazine is foxs firstperson tongueincheek version of 
how he and his wife actress tracy pollan kept at bay helicopters 
zoom lenses and an army of 40 reporters from the national enquirer 
star globe people magazine and other publications 
even i who have called a fishbowl home for most of the last 
six years was astounded by the lengths to which the tabloids would 
go in order to satisfy inquiring minds wrote fox star of the 
film back to the future and the television show family ties 
the magazine story due out next week details the apparent 
desperation of tabloid journalists who according to fox resorted 
to bribery lies and more in an unsuccessful effort to get a photo 
of the wedding couple in full regalia at the west mountain inn 
foxs publicist nanci ryder went undercover as a temporary 
office worker at the national enquirers headquarters in a 
manchester luxury hotel the article said she reported the 
tabloids strategy to fox and to a los angeles security expert 
hired to keep the wedding private 
after the wedding party succeeded in avoiding photographers fox 
charged sore losers among the press took out their frustration by 
portraying the couple as paranoid and their wedding as a security 
circus 
the reporters couldnt very well write about their colossal 
waste of money and effort so they projected their own fiasco onto 
the wedding wrote fox who shared a byline for the story with 
brotherinlaw michael pollan executive editor of harpers

secretary of state james a baker iii met 
today with west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg who 
presented some new suggestions for settling a heated dispute 
between the two nato allies over shortrange nuclear missiles in 
western europe 
the talks are aimed at bridging the gap between the two nations 
in order to sidestep confrontation at president bushs first north 
atlantic treaty organization meeting set for later this month 
state department officials had no immediate comment on the 
outcome of the halfhour meeting but a diplomatic source familiar 
with stoltenbergs proposals confirmed the west germans are 
prepared to be more flexible on the question of the timing of 
ussoviet negotiations involving the weapons 
the united states has opposed the idea of starting such 
negotiations fearing they would lead to pressures to remove all 
shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
stoltenbergs mission was to suggest a possible link between a 
reduction of soviet conventional forces in europe with the start of 
negotiations on cutting back the numbers of the shortrange nuclear 
weapons the negotiations might not begin until there is 
significant progress in cutting back the conventional arms in 
europe where the warsaw pact has a huge advantage 
one proposal would be to form a highlevel nato study group 
which would examine how much significant progress would be 
necessary before any ussoviet talks could convene the source 
said 
as stoltenberg held talks with baker and secretary of defense 
dick cheney a group of west german parliament members expressed 
confidence that a solution to the dilema would be found 
theres a new flexibility on both sides the chances we will 
reach an agreement are not 100 percent but given the political 
will theres a good chance we will reach an agreement before the 
nato summit said volcker ruehe the deputy majority leader in 
parliament in a meeting with reporters 
ruehe and a three other members of parliament said they were 
pleased with the reception they had gotten from officials at the 
department of state the national security council and on capitol 
hill in their talks on the dispute 
west german chancellor helmut kohl paved the way for 
stoltenbergs visit with a telephone call tuesday to president 
bush white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday he 
gave no details of the call which was initiated by kohl 
we continue to hope that we can reach some kind of an 
agreement before the nato summit may 29 but if not well 
discuss it there or later fitzwater said 
he was referring to the may 29 meeting of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization 
fitzwater said the dispute may also figure in talks that bush 
will have this weekend with french president francois mitterrand at 
bushs home in maine 
but the meeting is not designed to produce and specific 
agreements or results in that sense fitzwater said 
the us government opposes the german call for early talks with 
the soviet union on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
bonn objects to washingtons demands for an early nato commitment 
to upgrading natos lance missiles when those weapons become 
obsolete in 1995 
we look forward to the stoltenberg talks and think theyll be 
very productive fitzwater said 
asked if there had been progress toward a solution fitzwater 
said progress in the sense that were talking and we understand 
each others positions better but i couldnt give much more 
projection than that 
fitzwater said the united states is sticking to its position 
that talks should first produce a reduction in soviet bloc forces 
in europe to match nato levels only then would the united states 
be willing to consider discussing shortrange missiles 
in a satellite interview with european correspondents wednesday 
secretary of state james a baker iii said nuclear weapons are 
part of a defensive strategy we ought to move very very slowly 
before we abandon that strategy

sen nancy kassebaum rkan saying she had 
struggled with the decision for some time announced today she 
will seek reelection to a third term her decision dampened hopes 
of democrats to win their first senate seat from kansas in 50 years 
kassebaum said she will run in the 1990 elections because she 
does not want to hurt the state by retiring and leaving it without 
her seniority 
noting that she had pledged to serve only 12 years when she 
first ran for the senate kassebaum said she had struggled with 
it for some time but she said she decided to seek another term 
because there is no limit on the number of years a senator can 
serve 
unless everyones doing it you lose seniority that is 
valuable to ones state kassebaum said 
she pledged when she ran for the senate for the first time in 
1978 and again in 1984 that she would retire after 12 years in the 
senate but she opened the door to a possible third term a short 
time after winning reelection in 1984 
republicans have been urging kassebaum to run again fearing her 
retirement would give democrats their best chance at seizing a 
senate seat in kansas since 1974 when republican sen bob dole 
narrowly won a second term the last democrat to hold a senate seat 
from kansas was george mcgill who served from 193039 
political observers in kansas consider kassebaum an oddson 
favorite to win another term recent polling by her campaign 
organization found that most kansans would continue to support her 
for reelection in 1990 in spite of the twoterm pledge 
her popularity in kansas has scared away serious democratic 
opposition in the past and she won reelection in 1984 with 76 
percent of the votes 
kassebaum is the daughter of the late alf landon a kansas 
governor and 1936 republican presidential nominee she arrived at 
the senate a political novice with her previous elective 
experience limited to a local school board seat 
she and democrat barbara mikulski of maryland are the only women 
in the 100member senate

the editor of south africas 
leading financial newspaper said today police have ordered him to 
give testimony about an article he wrote criticizing their failure 
to solve a 1986 murder case 
police commissioner hennie de witt said police want to pursue 
claims by business day editor ken owen that his reporters found 
witnesses able to identify black miners who executed four fellow 
workers during a mass protest at a gold mine 
in a statement published by his newspaper owen said he would 
comply with the subpoena but contended the improper action was 
a response to his accusations that law and order minister adriaan 
vlok handled the case ineffectively 
the accusations were published monday in the article in which 
owen scathingly questioned why police had been unable to solve 
executions reportedly witnessed by 2000 black mine workers the 
victims also black were accused of breaking a boycott organized 
by militant union members 
vlok and his police have failed the most elementary test of a 
government whether or not it can uphold the common law owen 
wrote if he doesnt have the guts to fire them his senior 
officers one by one until they do something he should resign from 
his highly paid position and go into the obscurity he deserves 
de witt said in a statement wednesday that police had been 
unable to track down witnesses who could identify the killers and 
were willing to testify in court he said four suspects were 
arrested but released for lack of evidence 
owens article was unfair and slanderous the commissioner 
said 
de witt said police asked if he would supply information 
voluntarily and were told he would do so only if subpoenaed 
business day said in an editorial the staff of the newspaper 
do not wish to act as factgatherers or investigators for the 
police it would close off future sources of information

a veteran antiapartheid 
legislator today urged the heirapparent to the presidency to 
reveal his planned policies 
helen suzman said national party leader fw de klerk should 
now tell us and the world what he definitely will do to 
restore peace at home and respectability abroad 
it is virtually certain that de klerk 53 will succeed 
president pw botha who steps down after sept 6 general 
elections 
since becoming leader of the governing party in february de 
klerk has pledged to seek an end to racial discrimination but he 
has been vague about the type of powersharing he might extend to 
the disenfranchised black majority 
mrs suzman 71 who announced on wednesday she would end her 
36year parliamentary career said de klerk must put the 
countrys interests above those of the national party she urged 
him to use his influence to curtail government actions that might 
antagonize people 
deaths in detention more blatant abrogation of due process 
more hangings more forced removals are key provocative issues that 
must be avoided she said 
she suggested that de klerk declare a moratorium on hangings 
suspend residential segregation laws and end efforts to relocate 
black communities in tribal homelands 
none of these actions would in any way affect the political 
power structure in south africa mrs suzman said but they 
would contribute to creating a climate in which negotiations to 
ensure a peaceful future could commence she said 
south africas racial segregation or apartheid policies give the 
countrys 24 million blacks no vote in national affairs the 5 
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts 
schools and health services

president bush stumping for his 
education proposals with a visit to an urban magnet school vowed 
today to spur us businesses to help education help america 
bush stopping here on his way to a long weekend in 
kennebunkport maine where he was to meet with french president 
francois mitterrand sought to focus attention on his 441 million 
legislative package for education 
the fact is that unless we act our children will be 
illequipped to read write or understand new technologies he 
said 
the president spoke during a tour of an eastman kodak 
photographic plant after visiting the wilson magnet high school 
which offers special courses in computer science robotics 
photooptics and japanese language studies 
at the school bush met first with teachers to discuss the 
magnet program then chatted with about 350 students 
commitment was the word that kept coming through the 
president said of his meeting with the teachers 
youre the future he told cheering students im going to 
do my level best as president leave aside the politics to get 
this message of excellence and commitment and magnet schools way 
beyond the confines of new york all the way to the west coast and 
alaska 
he praised kodak for putting up some of the funds that he said 
helped the city school overcome a high dropout rate and a poor 
academic showing several years ago to become one of the toprated 
schools in new york state 
ten years ago wilson was beset by crime plunging grades and 
urban flight bush said but today wilson is the 
ninthranked school in the state of new york by the department of 
education 
rochester and kodak embody the notion that helping others 
through cooperation is america at her best the president 
said 
he challenged other us companies to follow the lead set by the 
photo giant which he said forged a partnership with the community 
which understood that the private sector has the resources and 
responsibility to help education help america 
bushs education package sent to congress on april 5 calls for 
100 million in new us spending on magnet schools such as wilson 
that offer special courses 
congressional democrats and educators have criticized the plan 
as inadequate and the president conceded today that our program 
is not a beall and endall 
but he said it is a commitment a commitment to help 
business and academia make america more productive 
before leaving washington bush met at the white house with 
nobel prize laureate archbishop desmond tutu and other south 
african antiapartheid leaders 
congressional leaders and antiapartheid activitists urged the 
administration on wednesday to impose additional economic sanctions 
against the white minorityruled pretoria government 
however presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
generally speaking we have not found sanctions productive and 
have opposed additional sanctions as being counterproductive 
under bushs proposal the federal education budget would go 
from 219 billion this year to 225 billion in fiscal 1990 which 
begins oct 1 
major new initiatives are 250 million for a merit schools 
program and 100 million for magnet schools offering specialized 
curriculum with an emphasis on math and science 
the education department already runs a 115 million magnet 
school program but the money is available only for desegregation 
purposes 
the wilson school in rochester is exactly the kind of thing 
the president has been talking about in his education policy 
where the community and business interests get together to address 
the problem said deputy white house press secretary stephen hart 
ten years ago the school was among those with new yorks 
highest rates of suspensions dropouts and truencies 
the community with the help of a 300000 grant from the 
eastman kodak co helped rewrite the schools curriculum to focus 
on science and humanities and provided the school with uptodate 
equipment now the school is one of the highestranked in the 
state according to information supplied by the white house

the federal aviation administration wants the 
power to ground pilots who are flying airplanes after having their 
motor vehicle licenses suspended or revoked for drunken driving 
more than 10000 licensed pilots have drunken driving records 
but officials said they had not determined how many might be 
affected the faa last month announced it was cracking down on more 
than 1000 pilots who had failed to report drunken driving actions 
under a proposed rule published in todays federal register the 
faa could deny an application or suspend a pilots certificate if 
the individuals license is revoked or suspended for an offense 
involving alcohol or drugs twice within three years 
the rulemaking follows concerns raised by the national 
transportation safety board over pilots who were allowed to fly 
even though their automobile drivers licenses were suspended for 
drunken driving the board has raised similar concerns over ship 
captains and others not under faa jurisdiction 
the faa rule would require that pilots report any alcohol or 
drugrelated convictions or administrative action that occurred 
within a threeyear period before the rule takes effect failure to 
report subsequent actions within 60 days after they occur would be 
grounds for losing a pilots license 
the rule would become final later this year if it passes a 
public comment period and further analysis by faa lawyers said 
agency spokeswoman joann sloane 
in a 1987 comparison of faa medical records with the national 
driver register the agency found that drivers licenses of 10300 
of the more than 700000 active pilots had been suspended or 
revoked in the preceding seven years for drunken driving 
more than threefourths of those did not report the convictions 
to the faa when applying for a medical certificate to fly although 
such a report is required the agency said 
the new rule also would cause a pilots medical certificate to 
expire 61 days after a single drunken driving conviction and 
require reapplication with proof that the pilot was enrolled in an 
alcohol treatment program 
both a medical certificate and a pilot certificate are required 
to fly

the commander of the atlantis space shuttle 
says he will cooperate to the best of my ability with three 
federal investigations into accusations that he nearly ran his 
space agency jet into a pan am airliner 
navy capt david m walker who commanded the fivemember 
shuttle crew on a fourday voyage that ended may 8 said all the 
facts have yet to be established on the incident the pilot of a 
pan am airbus 310 carrying 166 passengers and a crew of 10 from 
washington to paris initially reported the close call 
the federal aviation administration the national transportation 
safety board and the national aeronautics and space administration 
all opened investigations into the incident after the pan am pilot 
filed a report of a near midair collision 
the pilot said the nasa t38 jet came within 500 feet of the 
airliner 
i will be assisting to the best of my ability with both nasa 
and civil aviation authorities in their respective 
investigations walker said to discuss the issue further at 
this point would be inappropriate 
walker had flown to washington for white house ceremonies on 
tuesday honoring the atlantis crew 
a nasa statement said walker filed a hazardous air traffic 
report with personnel at andrews air force base upon landing 
spokesman jack riley said he did not know the nature of the report 
or its contents 
faa air traffic controllers filed a pilot deviation report 
accusing walker of violating flight procedures by not flying at his 
assigned altitude and saying the planes were within 100 feet 
vertically said faa spokesman jack leyden 
the pan am jet was flying at 7000 feet and walker was assigned 
to travel at 8000 feet but descended to 7000 the faa spokesman 
said the controllers issued an advisory that two planes were in 
the same area and walker took his jet to 8000 feet leyden said 
it was a very quick like instantaneous sighting said pan 
am spokesman alan loflin he said both planes were flying under 
instrument conditions but the pan am pilot saw the t38 because 
they were between cloud layers when they crossed paths 
leyden said both faa and safety board investigators on wednesday 
began looking into the incident but details of their work were not 
available 
a near collision generally is reported when two planes come 
within 500 feet of each other and either pilot feels they are in 
danger of colliding 
the faa considers an incident critical when planes came 
within 100 feet of each other at their closest point and 
potentially dangerous when they come within 500 feet 
leyden said possible enforcement action against a civilian pilot 
who deviates from procedures could range from an administrative 
letter to action affecting his license but he said that since 
walker is a navy pilot any conclusion would likely be referred to 
the military for further action 
the safety board which assigned three investigators to the 
case will determine the cause of the incident and recommend steps 
to be taken to prevent it from happening again but the board has 
no power to impose penalties 
nasa spokesman riley said the johnson space center was informed 
of the near collision on wednesday flight crew operations and 
safety personnel will conduct a detailed investigation of the 
incident hesaid 
no nasa t38 has crashed since the 1960s when four astronauts 
were killed in three accidents riley said he was not aware of any 
previous nearcollision reports involving the 24 nasa t38s which 
the astronauts use to maintain required flying hours and to travel 
between assignments

president bush stressing his abhorrence of 
apartheid today pledged american pressure to bring about 
justice and equality in south africa his spokesman said 
the president after meeting with nobel peace prize laureate 
desmond tutu invited albertina sisulu one of the leaders of the 
united democatic front in south africa to visit the united states 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the president shares the archbishops abhorrence of 
apartheid fitzwater said the president promised to stress his 
opposition in every way possible the asministration will be 
looking at ways to best use american pressure influence and 
leverage to bring about justice and equality to south africa 
tutu who heads the anglican church in south africa said he 
urged bush to take the moral leadership toward ending his 
countrys apartheid policies of racial separation and said he was 
enouraged the president had a warm openness to that cause 
we do not want to be overly optimistic tutu told reporters 
adding he had been impressed that bush appeared to genuinely abhor 
apartheid that he wanted to be a catalyst for change and a 
positive influence 
tutu and two other antiapartheid leaders revs allan boesak 
and beyers naude who met briefly with bush at the white house did 
not disclose the specifics of their conversation tutu indicated 
however they did not ask for specific initiatives other than that 
bush urge pretoria to negotiate with its opposition 
asked about the discussion tutu said we said we wanted to 
help the united states to take the moral leadership of the 
world in helping to end apartheid and bringing the south african 
government to the negotiating table which is our primary end 
although the white house said a day earlier that bush does not 
intend to back further sanctions against pretoria to press for 
social change in essence maintaining the policy of president 
reagan the leaders were upbeat after the meeting 
i think there is a very warm openness and we think the door 
stands ajar no door has been slammed in our face tutu said 
at a news conference later the group said bush and congress 
should support sanctions that would squeeze the economically 
strapped south african government and force it to the negotiating 
table 
boesak also urged bush to take advantage of indications of a 
recent soviet shift in southern africa toward more pragmatic 
policies or ask himself the question will we be trailing behind 
kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev again 
if bush fails to understand the importance of resolving the 
south african problem for the stability of the region and for 
superpower relations then its not only our funeral its his 
too boesak said 
the meeting itself was seen as a small victory for the 
antiapartheid activists 
under president reagan whose veto of antipretoria sanctions 
was overridden by congress we had the idea that here was a 
position that was taken and there was no further possibility of 
even discussing the issue here we have a feeling that the 
president has not closed his mind to any possibility of how he 
could best be helpful in the south african situation said boesak 
and the very fact that he values the opinion of those of us 
who represent black people in south africa that in itself is a 
sign that we did not get in the same measure from the previous 
administration 
the white house session was scheduled as us officials were 
preparing for the visit of fw de klerk who is expected to 
succeed president pw botha after botha resigns in september de 
klerk would be the first top south african leader to officially 
visit here in 30 years 
tutu as well as democrats in congress said bushs failure to 
meet with the trio would have shown his unwillingness to support an 
end to south africas racial segregation system 
antiapartheid leaders believe a window of opportunity may be 
created both by the new us administration and by the anticipated 
change in their countrys leadership de klerk has called for 
political reforms although he has ruled out complete 
enfranchisement for blacks who comprise 85 percent of the nations 
population 
the reagan administration argued that sanctions impoverish south 
africas 28 million blacks rather than forcing the government to 
reform

confronted with a relatively common toxin 
certain cells designed to protect the body can overreach and may 
even make things worse a colorado researcher reported thursday 
poisons produced by a bacteria blamed for many cases of food 
poisoning and toxic shock syndrome can cause a massive reaction by 
the bodys tcells causing them to flood the body with potent 
chemicals explained dr philippa marrack of the howard hughes 
medical institute in denver 
she is part of a team of researchers who reported their findings 
in the journal science published by the american association for 
the advancement of science 
normally tcells help protect the body by reproducing and 
issuing chemicals to attack invading organisms 
under ordinary circumstances such as the flu a complex series 
of five receptors is activated to set off the tcells meaning that 
only about one cell in 10000 to 100000 may react to the invader 
dr marrack explained in a telephone interview 
the coupling mechanism is much simpler with staphylococcus 
aurens a bacteria that is associated with toxic shock syndrome 
many cases of food poisoning and some other human and animal 
diseases she reported 
in this case only one of the five receptors has to be 
stimulated to cause the tcells to reapond dr marrack said 
the toxins might activate as many as onethird of the bodys 
one trillion tcells almost simultaneously she explained 
this massive triggering of tcells causes them to multiply 
rapidly and discharge potent chemicals in such quantities these 
chemicals can make the invidiual ill or even cause death she 
reported 
these chemicals and not the toxin probably produce the 
symptoms of food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome she said in 
a statement released by the institute which is located at the 
national jewish center for immunology and respiratory medicine 
dr marrack speculated that while the immune system is designed 
to attack invaders causing such an overreation may actually 
protect the staphylococcus aurens bacteria by overstimulating the 
system they may prevent it from being able to concentrate on the 
one invader she said 
just how this process works and why the reaction varies from one 
person to another are not understood she added 
most victims of staphylococcus aurens food poisoning recover 
with no longterm effects she said but cases have been reported 
in which victims later developed an immune systemrelated form of 
arthritis 
the new findings may explain this 
suppose a small number of tcells in your body have a tendency 
to attack your own joints but theyve never had enough energy or 
numbers to do so she said if a bacterial toxin stimulates 
these cells causing them to multiply rapidly you could wind up 
with a large number of bad guys that could cause arthritis lupus 
or some other autoimmune disease 
on the other hand in the long run the response may also be able 
to be used against such cells according to dr marrack if a group 
of tcells attacking the body could be identified a toxin might be 
tailored to stimulate them to multiply and then drugs used which 
kill only multiplying cells 
such a treatment however is not currently feasible and may not 
be for years she said 
other researchers taking part in the study included john 
kappler also of the howard hughes institute brian kotzin lynne 
herron erwin gelfand and yongwon choi of the national jewish 
center robert d bigler of hanneman university philadelphia 
arthur boylston university of leeds england stefan carrel 
ludwig institute for cancer research lausanne switzerland and

an allwhite jury today convicted a former 
ku klux klansman of murder for providing the rope and pistol used 
in the killing of a black teenager whose body was hung in a tree 
benjamin franklin cox 27 whispered i love you to his 
weeping wife before county deputies led him away in handcuffs 
circuit judge michael zoghby revoked coxs 28000 bond and set 
a june 23 sentencing hearing cox could be sentenced to 10 years to 
life in the march 21 1981 strangulation and hanging of 
19yearold michael donald 
prosecutors said donald was killed by klansmen angry about a 
1981 trial in which a black man was found innocent of killing a 
white policeman 
the verdict was delivered to a hushed courtroom filled with 
relatives and friends of both the victim and the defendant the 
jury deliberated about four hours over two days 
coxs conviction was the third successful prosecution in the 
last six years of trials stemming from the klan murder defense 
attorneys put on witnesses on the stand while the state called at 
least a dozen witnesses 
in closing arguments defense attorney neil hanley said the 
witnesses against cox had been coached and badgered into giving 
false testimony 
there is more than reasonable doubt there is a shocking 
doubt in this case hanley said 
hanley described the prosecutions case as zero plus zero 
equals zero drawing the equation on a board thats his 
circumstantial evidence 
district attorney chris galanos urged jurors to consider the 
big picture in which he claimed cox participated in the 
organized and orchestrated klan murder galanos called the 
slaying senseless mindless violence not just racism hate 
these people were klansmen galanos said ordinary 
civilized people would never sit around and talk about taking the 
life of another human being

house republicans after years of fighting the 
ruling democrats with noisy protests and parliamentary warfare are 
sitting back and smiling as they watch the storm encircling house 
speaker jim wright 
the texas democrat is facing charges before the house ethics 
committee and is the topic of nearly daily reports in the national 
news media 
the ethics panel decided today to hold a hearing next tuesday on 
wrights motions to dismiss the main charges against him and the 
arguments by lawyers for the two sides will be open to television 
coverage 
wrights spokeman mark johnson said the speaker welcomed the 
development and would renew his call for the committee to expedite 
its procedures 
in addition to the speakers troubles press reports have forced 
rep tony coelho dcalif wrights chief votecounter to revise 
and defend his own financial disclosure statements 
but most house republicans arent putting out press releases 
making speeches about it or even attacking the speaker in 
conversations with reporters 
rep newt gingrich rga the no 2 house republican who 
launched the probe against wright continues to comment when asked 
but hes avoiding television interviews on the topic asked what he 
was thinking about a story involving coelhos financial dealings 
he answered i dont 
rep jerry lewis of california chairman of the house republican 
conference says he has urged his colleagues to remain quiet in 
deference to the ethics process which eventually could require all 
members to pass judgment on the speaker 
lewis and rep robert michel of illinois the republican leader 
made clear theyre happy to have the news media take on the speaker 
without them 
far be it from this member to put any kind of cloud over a 
free press michel said at a session with reporters following 
president bushs visit with house republicans on wednesday 
far be it seconded lewis with a broad smile 
a rankandfile gop member speaking on condition his name not 
be used said the republicans are in the catbird seat for once 
good politics is also good policy he said 
while not directly attacking the democrats on ethics the 
republicans are needling the democrats for the slow pace of 
legislation and blaming it on disarray in wrights leadership 
team 
michel said it takes a strong hand to push through 
contentious legislation such as the supplemental spending bill 
which house democrats failed for a second time wednesday to push 
forward to a final vote 
for wright i think that power has been eroded by what 
weve been witness to in the last several months michel said 
rep thomas foley of washington the majority leader and the 
next ranking democrat after wright defended the speaker wednesday 
as fully involved and said there was no gridlock in the 
house as the republicans claimed 
but it is clear wrights problems are much on the minds of 
democrats a group of more than a dozen moderate democrats who have 
been supportive of wright held a grim hourlong meeting in the 
capitol on wednesday to discuss the speakers plight 
the group was scheduled to meet again today and one lawmaker 
said the subject of the meetings was too hot to discuss 
publicly a house member familiar with the discussions said one 
topic is whether a protracted defense of the speaker will prove too 
politically damaging to the party 
one of the participants rep david obey dwis said he argued 
that wright should have an opportunity to make his legal case on 
the ethics charges without delay 
but obey added wright will also have to at some other 
time i would hope make a judgment about the political 
situation 
obey said the discussion revolved around whether or not jim 
can get a review on the issues without the political question 
getting in the way 
the ethics committee meanwhile continued to investigate a gas 
drilling venture last year that yielded a quick 170000 profit for 
wright at a time when he needed 100000 to pay off a bank loan for 
another deal that went sour 
the panel also was meeting today to decide how to handle 
wrights motion to dismiss the two most serious sets of charges 
against him that he sought to evade limits on outside income 
through bulk sales of his book and that he accepted improper gifts 
from business partner george mallick deemed by the panel to have 
had a direct interest in legislation 
the motions to dismiss charges are important because they 
represent a chance to win a badly needed victory and to avoid a 
fullblown hearing on the matters that could be the most 
embarrassing to the speaker 
the motions are quite significant wright said repeating 
his argument that the ethics committee is seeking to hold him to 
some new and higher standard than provided for in house rules 
members need an assurance that the rules mean what they say and 
wont be changed to fit the specific situation its important not 
just to me but to the whole congress 
the los angeles times reported today that the criminal division 
of the internal revenue services is conducting a preliminary 
investigation into the speakers business dealings with mallick 
the times quoting unidentified federal sources said agents 
from the irs dallas bureau were looking at a broad range of 
transactions involving mallightco the company formed by the two 
men and their wives 
at irs headquarters in washington spokesman wilson fadely 
declined comment on the report the irs is prohibited by law from 
disclosing whether or not we are investigating any taxpayer he 
said

federal authorities today announced 
requirements that us airlines make extensive modifications on 
older boeing 727s 737s and 747s marking a major change in the 
governments approach to the safety of aging airliners 
the federal aviation administration issued a series of proposed 
airworthiness directives that initially will affect 115 
airliners requiring 142 million in modifications 
the action marks a fundamental change in faas philosophy for 
maintaining the airworthiness of older aircraft the faa said in 
announcing the directives which are expected to become final in 
late summer 
the action was prompted by the april 1988 accident in which a 
boeing 737 with nearly 90000 flights lost an 18foot section of 
its fuselage in a flight over hawaii a flight attendant died the 
aircraft then landed without any other fatalities 
investigators found the planes fuselage had worn out and a 
series of regular inspections were ordered on all aging airliners 
faas action today would replace most required inspections for 
corrosion cracking and other signs of metal fatigue with mandatory 
replacements 
among work that would have to be done on the planes are 
strengthening of basic structures and replacement of such parts as 
landing gears 
one requirement for 747s calls for a major modification of the 
fuselage shell structure from the nose to the forward main 
passenger entry door the faa estimates the work will take 14000 
man hours per airplane 
airlines would be allowed four years to complete all the 
changes with inspection programs to continue in the interim 
the faa said the orders would affect 67 boeing 727s 28 737s and 
20 747s now being flown by us airlnes additional aircraft would 
be affected as they reach 20 years of age or a set number of 
flights 60000 for 727s 75000 for 737s and 20000 for 747s 
although foreign airlines flying the usbuilt planes are not 
required to comply they generally follow faa safety directives 
the faa annoucement said the agency would work with airlines to 
assure that older airliners which have the greatest use or which 
have not undergone recent inspections will have the work done first 
the requirements follow guidelines proposed feb 28 by a task 
force of aviation industry and government experts set up by the air 
transport association and the aerospace industries associaton

the us supreme court today cleared 
the way for a 15yearold florida girl to obtain an abortion 
without the consent of her parents or a judge 
the justices without comment or any recorded dissenting vote 
set aside an order issued by justice anthony m kennedy on tuesday 
that had blocked any abortion for the lake county girl identified 
in court records as tw 
the courts action makes unenforceable a florida law requiring 
minors to get permission from their parents or a state judge before 
having an abortion 
a state judge earlier this month struck down the law as 
unconstitutional and his ruling was upheld by a state appeals 
court the florida supreme court plans to consider the laws 
constitutionality in september 
the state appeals court said the laws provision permitting a 
judge to approve an abortion for a young girl is too vague and 
could result in arbitrary denials of permission by judge 
kennedy had acted on a request by a lawyer appointed to 
represent the girls 12weekold fetus 
an antiabortion activist said today she remains hopeful that 
the florida supreme court will uphold the abortionconsent law and 
said she was encouraged that the us supreme court had become 
involved in the case 
it is not as if they have washed their hands of the serious 
matter the young lady has been involved in i would like to think 
they still have a concern in the parental consent bill said jean 
doyle executive director of florida right to life in orlando 
the fact they took it up the fact they were interested is for 
me a matter of excitement she said i have not lost the 
excitement the fact it was a matter of such importance the court 
would be willing to consider it 
on wednesday the florida attorney generals office filed papers 
with the high court asking that the state be considered a party to 
the case because it involves the validity of its abortion consent 
law 
the state is not interested in whether this minor can prove 
her case said assistant attorney general jerry curington 
were simply trying to uphold the statute itself 
the abortion consent law which went into effect in february 
requires unmarried girls under age 18 to obtain permission from 
their parents or a judge to have an abortion 
the 15yearold girl asked a lake county court for permission to 
get an abortion without her parents consent saying she could not 
approach her parents without fear of emotional or physical abuse 
circuit judge jerry lockett who appointed a lawyer to represent 
the girls fetus denied the permission but ruled the consent law 
was unworkable and unconstitutionally vague a state appeals court 
also ruled it unconstitutional 
kennedys order blocking the abortion came hours after the state 
supreme court said it would allow the girl to get an abortion and 
that it would rule this fall on the laws constitutionality 
the request went to kennedy because he is assigned to the 11th 
us judicial circuit which includes florida 
the girls attorney jerri blair wants the stay lifted she 
said some clinics wont perform abortions after the 13th week of 
pregnancy because of a greater risk of medical complications 
ms blair said her request argues that it would be improper for 
the us supreme court to consider a motion filed on behalf of a 
fetus she cited the high courts 1973 ruling in roe vs wade that 
upheld the right of women to have abortions 
under roe vs wade the fetus has no legal standing ms 
blair said 
florida is among 14 states with consent laws but two are 
unenforced and three have been blocked by courts said kathryn 
kolbert an american civil liberties lawyer in new york city

make sure the issue is preserved for future consideration by the 
us supreme court the issue could be declared moot if the girl

authoritarian rule in south korea again 
we must remain alert to crush them and inherit the spirit of 
kwangju kim said in the message 
most protests were peaceful but radical students in southern 
chonju hurled firebombs at a government party office and clashed 
with riot police who tried to disperse about 2000 marchers 
according to yonhap the south korean news agency about 20 people 
were injured yonhap said 
in seoul thousands of riot police stood by to block protests 
and chased bands of students who ran through the streets shouting 
antigovernment slogans but there were no reports of injuries

government armory in kwangju on may 18 1980 and took control of 
the city troops were sent in to put down the uprising after 
negotiations failed 
government reports said 192 people were killed and hundreds 
injured but opposition groups claim hundreds more were killed

a house panel voted today to make savings and 
loan banks add 600 million over the next three years to their 
share of an industry bailout and potentially billions of dollars 
more over the next three decades 
the ways and means committee however rejected raising taxes 
through a 15 percent surtax for five years to pay for the 
governments immediate 50 billion share of the costs in assuring 
depositors in insolvent sampls against losses 
on a voice vote the committee said sampls have to contribute 600 
million more to the bailouts cost in 1991 and 1992 and potentially 
billions of dollars more over the next three decades by indexing 
increases in a required 300 million annual contribution to the 
rate of inflation 
the committee later approved the overall bill on a 2610 vote 
the defeated surtax would have been the first since such a 
revenueincreasing measure was adopted by the government since the 
late president lyndon johnson used one to finance the vietnam war 
its purpose was to save an estimated 200 billion in interest 
costs that taxpayers will have to absorb over the next 30 years by 
financing the governments share of the bailout through increased 
borrowing 
weve got garbage and none of us wants to carry it out said 
rep sam gibbons dfla who proposed the surtax so what were 
saying is that our children and grandchildren are going to carry it 
out thats just morally and ethically wrong 
gibbons proposed surtax effectively would have added 150 in 
taxes a year for every 10000 in federal income taxes paid by an 
individual family or company 
it was defeated on a 1013 vote after rep frank j guarini 
dnj said it would only derail everything thats been done 
in view of president bushs campaign pledge of no new taxes 
i think the train already has left the station guarini 
said referring to a nonewtax agreement on the budget approved 
wednesday by the house and up for a vote in the senate today im 
not looking for a train wreck at this point 
however the committee reaffirmed its vote last week to make the 
bailout part of the federal deficit defeating bushs proposal to 
finance it through private bond sales in order to make it appear 
that the deficit is being reduced 
the congressional budget office and others have estimated bushs 
plan would cost taxpayers an additional 45 billion in interest 
costs over the next 30 years than if the money was borrowed 
directly from the treasury

the water in the worlds oceans appears to be 
rising a tenth of an inch per year a change that could indicate 
that the planet is indeed warming up a pair of canadian 
researchers reported thursday 
scientists concerned about possible climate warming caused by 
the socalled greenhouse effect have said that one likely 
result would be rising sea levels as the polar ice caps melt 
but detailed evidence has been lacking with sea levels 
apparently rising in some areas and falling in others 
now wr peltier and am tushingham of the university of 
toronto report in the journal science that they have calculated an 
average sea level rise of 24 millimeters annually over the last 
century or so thats about a tenth of an inch per year 
our analyses should not be construed as proof that global 
climate warming due to the enhanced greenhouse effect or some 
other uinknown cause is occurring they cautioned in the journal 
published by the american association for the advancement of 
science 
it would not be surprising however if the direct action of 
the expected enhancement of the greenhouse effect were first 
observed through an indirect response such as an increase in global 
sea level they added 
overall warming of the waters that cover about threefourths of 
the planet could account for about 25 percent of the rising seas 
since warmer water expands and takes up more space than colder 
water tushingham and peltier noted 
but most of the change seems likely to be a result of melting of 
the ice caps on antarctica and greenland they reported 
measuring changes in global climate is a complex task and 
researchers tend to disagree about the results weather varies 
considerably from day to day and year to year making it hard to 
detect trends over time 
for example while some researchers contend temperature records 
show a global warming over the last century others say that the 
apparent rise was caused by city growth around weather stations 
raising local readings or other special circumstances 
in trying to sort out the sea levels peltier and tushingham 
noted that a problem is caused by the fact that the massive sheets 
of the last ice age pressed down on land areas in the northern 
hemisphere 
even today thousands of years later some land areas continue 
to gradually rebound from that pressure with the rising land 
making coastal tide gauges appear to show falling water 
the researchers averaged reports from tide gauges around the 
world in an effort to filter out local effects such as rising land 
levels 
they then calculated that on average sea levels are rising 24 
millimeters annually give or take 09 millimeter 
the rate of relative sea level rise is strongly suggestive 
of the action of ongoing glacier and ice sheet melting they 
concluded 
the greenhouse effect has attracted widespread attention 
recently with scientists concerned that if the planet does warm 
droughts will occur major farming areas will be damaged and other 
changes in society will result 
the term greenhouse effect is used because the increasing levels 
of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere allow sunlight 
to warm the planet but reduce the amount of balancing warmth 
radiated back into space somewhat in the way a greenhouse traps 
warmth inside

a 213 million jackpot is awaiting one 
lottery ticket holder and disappointment is in store for countless 
others who saw the wrong numbers on tv 
californias lotto 649 drawing wednesday night was broadcast 
live from sacramento to the stations that usually carry it rather 
than break into a dodgers baseball game kttv in los angeles 
superimposed the numbers 
lotto officials said the station told them a technical mixup 
caused numbers from the april 12 drawing to appear by mistake kttv 
interrupted its game broadcast a short time later to give the 
correct numbers and explain the error 
weve had calls from people who said they had the winning 
number but they tore up their tickets said lottery spokeswoman 
joanne mcnabb 
those people can file a claim with the lottery security office 
she said 
many other callers complained that they mistakenly thought they 
had won the jackpot or one of the lesser prizes which range down 
to 5 
lottery officials thursday said only one jackpotwinning ticket 
was sold but they had not yet verified the name of a winner 
for the record the numbers were 10 22 26 31 33 46 and the

more progress has been made in trade 
talks among the united states and nearly 100 other countries than 
at this stage in any of the previous rounds of talks since world 
war ii arthur dunkel head of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade gatt said thursday 
gatt is an international body based in geneva switzerland as 
well as an accord that embraces nearly 100 countries it has 
sponsored a series of these negotiations ending with the tokyo 
round completed in 1979 the current uruguay round is due for 
completion next year 
dunkel emphasized that member countries will have to negotiate 
with others about policies that they have been used to considering 
strictly their own business 
automatic retreat behind the banner of national sovereignty 
will not be good enough in the future he said 
these matters include farm policy intellectual property 
rights such as patents and copyright and treatment of foreign 
suppliers of services like banking and air travel 
the new streamlined dispute settlement procedure is now in 
place he said 
gatts way of settling disputes has been criticized in this 
country as slow and ineffective the new system permits but does 
not require the use of binding arbitration it sets up time limits 
for a complex process of negotiation and judgment by panels made up 
from governments neutral in any given dispute it makes setting up 
such panels easier in the past countries accused of an unfair 
practice have often been able to block them 
a new international system of reviewing the trade policies of 
individual countries will start in earnest with the united states 
this year dunkel added his organization will conduct the reviews 
which could be criticial of national policies 
he noted that third world countries are already benefiting from 
concessions by the united states and others to encourage the sale 
of tropical products that in the past has amounted to 20 billion a 
year 
as a result of a conference last month the governments have now 
agreed on how they plan to negotiate 15 different agreements 
the most important 
reducing farm subsidies that cost taxpayers and consumers in 
the united states and other countries an estimated 120 billion a 
year former president reagan asked that the subsidies on 
international trade be eliminated by the year 2000 but the 
agreement now is to have progressive reductions and no end date has 
beeen set 
an accord on trade in services which now provide more jobs and 
income than manufacturing in the united states and many other 
industrial countries 
a new system of safeguards to protect a countrys own industry 
against sudden surges of imports 
dunkel spoke at a conference organized by the delegation in 
washington of the european economic community

the casket was for a young man killed in an auto racing

the largest onemonth jump in gasoline prices 
since the government began keeping track in the 1930s sent the 
overall inflation rate for consumers soaring 07 percent in april 
the sharpest advance in more than two years the government said 
thursday 
the labor department said gasoline prices skyrocketed 114 
percent in april following substantial gains of 21 percent in 
march and 17 percent in february 
financial markets noting the heavy influence of the energy 
price gains which are not expected to repeat in the coming months 
shrugged off the bad news the dow jones industrial stock average 
slipped 5 points in the first half hour of trading but then quickly 
recovered 
the overall april increase if it continued for 12 months would 
amount to an annual inflation rate of 81 percent it was the 
sharpest climb since an identical 07 percent gain in january 1987 
for the first four months of 1989 inflation was running at an 
annual rate of 66 percent half again the 44 percent rate posted 
for both 1988 and 1987 
the bush administration which is hoping inflation will moderate 
and allow the federal reserve board to push down interest rates 
read the report favorably 
we think its kind of like a bulge moving through the economy 
other than energy prices inflation looks like its in pretty good 
shape white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
energy accounted for about 60 percent of the april advance the 
previous monthly record for gasoline was 74 percent hit in 
january 1987 and march 1974 
the department noted however that although gasoline prices 
have zoomed upward 167 percent this year they were still 177 
percent below their peak in march 1981 during the opec oil crisis 
the 51 percent advance for all energy costs also set a record 
and followed a 11 percent rise in march home heating oil prices 
rose 22 percent natural gas and electricity prices were up 06 
percent 
economist s jay levy of levy economic forecasts in chappaqua 
ny said that crude oil prices which have jumped about 30 
percent since the start of the year have already eased somewhat 
but that wont necessarily translate immediately into relief for 
motorists at the gasoline pump he said 
gasoline could very well increase further because of a 
shortage of refining capacity and because of an increase in 
seasonal demand during the summer he said 
on tuesday the federal energy information administration 
projected that gasoline prices for all grades would rise by the 
summer to an average of 109 per gallon from 105 currently the 
average price last summer was 99 cents a gallon 
food and beverage costs in april rose a moderate 05 percent 
prices for fats and oils meat and poultry dairy products baked 
goods and fruits and vegetables all rose prices of sugar and 
sweets fell a slight 01 percent 
levy said food prices were no longer being influenced by last 
years drought but he said it was too soon to tell if this years 
growing conditions will be favorable enough to bring food prices 
down 
the rate of inflation excluding the volatile food and energy 
areas a calculation analysts say is often a better measure of 
underlying inflationary pressures than the broader index rose only 
02 percent in april the annualized rate for this core 
inflation from february through april was 42 percent down from a 
49 percent in the preceding six months 
economist lawrence a hunter of the us chamber of commerce 
said the report should be clear and convincing evidence to the 
fed that the time has come to ease interest rates 
but economist michael moran of daiwa securities america inc 
said that while the fed may read the report positively it will 
not interpret it as a signal to ease credit restraints 
they need to keep a firm grip on policy or the secondary 
effects of energy prices could become important he said many 
items consume energy in their production process and the overall 
consumer index including energy is the basis for many 
costofliving increases including those in social security 
benefits 
the april figures left the overall consumer price index at 1231 
percent of its 198284 base meaning that a hypothetical selection 
of goods costing 100 during the base period would have cost 
12310 in april 80 cents more than in march 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation rose 12 
percent in april after falling 03 percent a month earlier 
average weekly earnings in april before adjusting for 
inflation were 33408 up 43 percent from a year earlier taking 
the 53 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over 
the 12month period real weekly earnings were down 09 percent 
the labor department offered these other details on price 
changes in april 
apparel prices rose a modest 03 percent after jumping 14 
percent a month earlier early spring sales of womens clothing 
somewhat offset the normal price increases at the start of a season 
medical care costs were up 05 percent the same as in march 
entertainment prices climbed 06 percent double the march rate 
of 03 percent 
transportation costs reflecting gasoline hikes rose 21 
percent the sharpest in nearly seven years new car prices rose a 
slight 01 percent reflecting manufacturers incentives to bolster 
lagging sales used car prices fell 03 percent 
the cost of services climbed a modest 02 percent in april even 
though the labor market remains tight the moderate increase came 
despite a 09 percent hike for the cost of telephone services 
reflecting a nationwide increase in line access charges

of a murderer who is scheduled to die tonight in georgias electric 
chair 
henry willis iii 36 was sentenced to death for his part in the 
feb 11 1976 killing of ray city police chief ed giddens

a stay of execution his attorney millard farmer said he was 
preparing an appeal to the georgia supreme court 
the state board of pardons and paroles also scheduled a clemency 
hearing on willis case in atlanta 
giddens was 29 when he was abducted and killed after he stopped

where he was shot when he ran from his abductors he was shot again 
at close range in the face and thrown into the swamp according to 
trial testimony 
a friend of giddens robert swanson now alapaha chief of

subcommittee on military installations and facilities questioned 
what the pentagon plans to do with the bases which cost the united 
states 394 million to construct and 67 million in family housing 
nato spent 312 million on the bases 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the 
subcommittee asked whether the 401st tactical fighter wing which 
spain demanded leave the base at torrejon de ardoz could be 
relocated to one of the inf bases 
the united states plans to move the wing to crotone italy 
where construction of a new base is expected to cost nato more than 
800 million with the united states paying 26 million for 
construction 
rep william dickinson rala emphasized that lawmakers do not 
want to see the bases go unused and reminded pentagon officials 
that the nation cannot afford to construct a new base at crotone 
we remember the birthing of the groundlaunched cruise missile 
bases said dickinson who listed all the facilities that had to 
be built on the base including schools commissaries and chapels 
we cant start from scratch again dickinson said the 
money is just not there why cant we have some alternative 
use 
john a woodworth deputy assistant secretary of defense for 
international security policy said us officials are studying 
ways to make the most efficient use of the bases 
he also sought to assure ireland that pentagon officials arent 
making up possible missions for the bases 
i dont think the objective is to tell people in the field to 
develop uses of these bases so we have a good story woodworth 
said 
committee members also questioned why the 15000 troops assigned 
to operate the facilities could not return home defense secretary 
dick cheney has proposed in the fiscal 1990 budget bringing back 
about 4000 troops from europe and replacing a brigade at fort 
carson colo with national guard reserves 
woodworth said that by the end of fiscal 1991 the number of 
personnel spaces in europe to support the pershings will be 
reduced by 5685 from the total of 14562 
the remaining personnel will be used for air base ground 
defense medical war readiness and upgrade of an undermanned combat 
support and service unit woodworth said 
but schroeder complained that instead of taking troops from 
europe the pentagon plans to cut the brigade in her home state 
and rep solomon ortiz dtexas said leaving a high number of 
troops in europe would not save taxpayers dollars 
ireland who has introduced a resolution to reassign civilian 
and military personnel associated with inf to the united states 
said that unless we bring our extensive alliance commitments into 
line with contemporary fiscal reality we could set ourselves on 
the road to ruin that has brought down so many great powers before 
us

some admirers convinced ronald reagans place 
in history will be monumental think the place for a monument to 
him is amid the greats on mount rushmore 
but tom griffith executive secretary of the mount rushmore 
society in rapid city sd suggests they have rocks in their 
heads 
why fool with a masterpiece asks griffith would you 
paint another figure next to the mona lisa 
the idea of adding reagan to mount rushmore was advanced in 1984 
by frank fahrenkopf jr then republican national chairman but its 
current champion is r emmett tyrrell jr editor of the american 
spectator a monthly conservative review 
he says reagan earned a place on the mountaintop beside 
washington jefferson lincoln and theodore roosevelt because he 
brought peace and prosperity to a country riven by fear 
he sounds half serious and half notsoserious but he says 
he did raise the idea with reagan over dinner last july 
reagan smiled he said 
ever since word got out tyrrell said he has been dogged by 
the maniacs in favor and the maniacs against 
out of ecological consideration he said hed be willing to 
cast a concrete reagan nose and chin and an ear or two and 
helicopter them in keeping blasting on the mountain to a minimum 
washingtons head has a serious crack and no one wants to make 
that worse 
also promoting the idea is young americans for freedom which 
sent out an addreagantorushmore ballot in 23000 fundraising 
letters the results will be counted in june said tom lizardo yaf 
executive director and if the response is an enthusiastic 
goforit yaf may petition the interior department 
it wont happen says griffith whose organization raised 
the original 1 million required for 360 workmen to dynamite and 
drill the visages of the four presidents into a granite cliff in 
the black hills of south dakota between 1927 and 1941 
the faces are the largest carved figures anywhere washingtons 
is as high as a fivestory building bigger than any sphinx in 
egypt 
the simple fact is there is no more suitable rock to carve 
anyone at mount rushmore griffith said 
tyrrell argues that surely reagan could be tucked in on 
washingtons right side or between roosevelt and lincoln 
as for the cost hed have the people of south dakota handle 
that 
its going to be their tourist trap he said and they 
ought to pay for it

surgeons reattached a 10yearold boys skull to 
his spine after his head was nearly pulled off in a bicycle 
accident 
doctors said they are confident timothy mathias of glendale will 
regain most of his faculties and walk out of the hospital he was 
listed in serious but stable condition thursday at st josephs 
hospital and medical center 
the rare fivehour operation performed april 26 at barrow 
neurological institute on the hospital grounds was made even more 
difficult by the presence of a golf ballsize blood clot at the top 
of the spinal column doctors said 
hes an absolute miracle child by all rights he should be 
dead said barrow medical director robert spetzler 
timmy was on his way to school april 21 when he rode his bicycle 
into the path of a pickup he was dragged about 15 feet and his 
skull was pulled away from his neck vertebrae only muscle and 
ligaments held his head onto his spine 
kerry mathias the boys mother said i was told he had only 
a 5 percent chance of surviving the operation its miraculous that 
they were able to do all this work in one shot 
surgeons said only 18 similar trauma cases have been recorded 
twelve survived but none of the cases involved blood clots 
timmy can move his left side and is beginning to move the right 
side of his body although nerve tissue cannot regenerate doctors 
say that the nerves may form new connections to compensate for 
damaged neural pathways 
he may walk with a limp but months down the line he will be 
walking said dr harold rekate chief of pediatric neurosurgery 
spetzler said emergency medical technicians saved the childs 
life by recognizing the severity of his injuries and taping him to 
a board to immobilize him 
one millimeter movement of the boys head in relation to his 
spinal column would have been fatal spetzler said 
spetzler said the sixsurgeon team discovered the massive blood 
clot just above the back of the throat only because they used an 
experimental lowstrength magnetic resonance imager to scan for 
injuries 
a normal imager could not be used because the boys metal 
lifesupport system would have interfered with the magnetic field 
used to generate images 
the clot was drained through an incision at the neck doctors 
said the boy would have died if the clot had not been discovered 
before the reattachment 
dr volker sonntag director of the spinal cord injury unit at 
barrow said he then inserted a 6inch ushaped steel brace to 
hold the skull in place 
the brace covered with bone marrow from timmys hip will 
remain in his head and restrict rotation about 50 percent doctors 
expect the marrow to harden and cover the brace

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said thursday that an agriculture department proposal to 
streamline meat inspections should be sent back totally to the 
drawing board and predicted that congress would overturn a 
lessening of the federal standards 
if producers of food have learned anything from the alar and 
other scares the last two months it is that this is not the time 
to do anything to give the suggestion of less safety in food 
leahy said 
he commented a day after consumer and labor organizations 
charged that a streamlined inspection system proposed by the 
department for cattle carcasses at packing houses could result in 
more contamination of the beef supply 
under the proposal federal inspectors at 40 to 50 of the 
largest slaughter plants accounting for about 80 percent of the 
nations beef would rely more on company workers to keep hair 
mud excreta and other contaminants from the beef supply 
one result would be to speed up the lines of carcasses moving 
along the inspection route leaving inspectors less time to check 
for abcesses tumors and other abnormalities 
leahy said that the nations food supply is now safe but that 
if the agriculture department takes this step im not sure we 
can guarantee it 
the chairman said in a telephone interview that in his 15 years 
in the senate he had never seen a time when people are more 
concerned about food safety than they are now for decent 
inspection of all types people are willing to pay the tiny amount 
extra that it costs 
leahy said he has been pressing the agriculture department for 
more than two years to make changes in its meat and poultry 
inspection system and to modify some of the proposals it has under 
consideration 
if changes arent made by the department he said congress is 
going to do it legislatively when it writes the 1990 farm bill 
department officials say they wont decide whether to proceed 
with the proposed revisions in packing house inspection standards 
until they review public comments which have been coming in since 
the proposal was made in december 
the meatpacking industry led by the american meat institute 
wants the plan reviewed by a scientific panel before it is finally 
approved to ensure that meat safety would not be diminished 
a separate but equally controversial department proposal 
announced last november would reduce the number of federal 
inspectors at plants that turn out chicken soup hot dogs and other 
processed meat and poultry items 
one goal of this riskbased system would be to use computers 
and other technology to replace some of the daybyday surveillance 
by federal inspectors in processing plants with good records 
the proposed program would ease up on good plants and allow 
a certain degree of selfpolicing but those with poor inspection 
records would be subject to closer supervision 
leahy said both proposals ought to be withdrawn and sent back 
totally to the drawing boards although adding that some aspects 
of each may make a lot of sense and perhaps should be reconsidered 
have the agriculture department and secretary clayton yeutter 
gotten leahys message 
i hope they have he said because administratively the 
department could take all the steps necessary to assure safety and 
quality if they are unwilling to do it administratively then i 
can guarantee the congress is going to do it legislatively

coverage thursday to students and workers demonstrating for 
democratic reform

sympathy with protesters for the heavily censored press 
one million from all walks of life demonstrate in support of 
hungerstriking students read the banner headline on the 
peoples daily the official organ of the communist party 
protests since midapril have gone largely unreported and many 
chinese relied on western media coverage for accurate accounts 
largescale demonstrations in more than 20 cities 
nationwide read the headline in the guangming daily it was one 
of seven frontpage stories on the protests 
the condition of the students and the future of the country 
touched the heart of every chinese who has a conscience the 
newspaper said 
chinese were hungry for news of the democracy movement 
there is no free press and that breeds corruption said xue 
yong a novelist from hebei province at tiananmen on thursday 
its only in the last couple of days that weve seen fairly 
objective reporting thats the great sorrow of chinas media 
we depend a great deal on the foreign press we dont trust

it would have been hard for newspapers to ignore the story 
more than 1 million people swarmed into the streets of the 
capital wednesday to call for democracy it was largest show of 
public defiance in 40 years of communist rule 
of six articles on the front page of the peoples daily five 
were about the demonstrations only a small bottom corner was 
devoted to the historic visit to china by soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev for the first sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
the student protests began with the april 15 death of hu 
yaobang an ousted communist party chief who pushed for democratic 
reforms but the first sympathetic coverage came only on april 23 
after journalists at the daily science and technology news 
threatened to quit 
and it wasnt until this week that many newspapers followed suit 
when more than 3000 students began a hunger strike on saturday 
a press emboldened by the science and technology news article 
began westernlike coverage newspapers carried accurate and fairly 
complete accounts of events and details of the students demands 
including a free press 
electronic media though slower have also picked up on the 
trend 
beijing tv interrupted programming four times thursday with news 
updates on the demonstrations china central televisions evening 
news showed leaders visiting hunger strikers in a hospital 
newscasters read letters from viewers calling for authorities to 
agree to meet with the fasters

in shelling that killed one civilian and wounded five thursday in a 
palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of sidon in south 
lebanon police reported 
police in the ancient port 25 miles south of beirut said two 
155mm shells were fired from positions manned by the south lebanon 
army militia in nearby jezzine and landed at the edge of the ein 
elhilweh camp 
the sunni nasserite militia that controls sidon said earlier it 
had gone on alert because the militia threatened to shell the city 
if its border enclave did not receive a share of 
governmentsubsidized flour being unloaded at the port 
israel sponsors the south lebanon army a predominantly 
christian militia that helps patrol a security zone north of 
the border israel established the zone ranging in depth from six 
to 10 miles when most of its soldiers withdrew in june 1985 after 
a threeyear occupation 
a statement from the nasserite militia said the zones share of 
flour was ready and waiting for someone to come and receive it 
it is the share of the lebanese people in the enclave which the 
lebanese government has bought we never tried to deny the lebanese 
people its food 
about 225000 people live in the zone including 25000 who have 
fled south since march 8 when an artillery war began in beirut 
between a syriandruse alliance and christian army units led by 
gen michele aoun 
shortages of flour fuel and other supplies have developed since 
the beirut port was closed by the shelling

temporarily and withdrawing the staff because the building had 
suffered heavy shelling damage a dispatch from berlin by the 
official east german news agency adn did not say how many people

four years ago boston businesses raised 55 
million to ensure that no student in the citys public schools 
would be denied a college education for lack of money 
now the first group of students supported by the scholarship 
and counseling program named access is finishing college at a 
graduation rate nearly three times the national average for 
innercity youth 
the idea was to keep them from dropping out of high school 
now it turns out the program also has the wonderful effect of 
keeping them in college said edward e phillips chairman of the 
new england an insurance and financial services firm 
from 99 students receiving about 50000 in the 198586 school 
year the scholarship program has grown to 335 students receiving 
282000 this year 
similar programs have been created in dayton ohio dade county 
fla wake city nc alexandria va and other school districts 
among the first graduates is cindy sealey an education major at 
emmanuel college in boston she cried softly at a news conference 
thursday when the citys school superintendent handed her a 
surprise a letter promising a teaching job in the fall 
business leaders on thursday called attention to one statistic 
in particular of the original 99 students who received 
scholarships 79 have graduated or are expected to graduate from 
college 
that represents an anticipated graduation rate 50 percent 
higher than for all college students nationally and nearly three 
times higher than the rate of inner city youth who enter college 
said phillips program chairman and chief fundraiser 
the program pays for six fulltime counselors who help students 
obtain funding from various sources including state and federal 
grants college scholarships and financial aid workstudy funds 
and guaranteed student loans 
then after those sources have been exhausted the business 
group provides lastdollar scholarships to make up the 
difference between the cost of college and what the students and 
their families can afford 
throughout their college years the students can contact access 
counselors for financial personal or academic advice 
gov michael s dukakis said he believes the counseling is as 
important as the money it seems to me that what we have here is 
an idea that can work for young people all over the united 
states of america he said 
m derek thomas a burly exrunning back who once dreamed of a 
career in professional sports said the program allowed him to go 
to rutgers university in new brunswick nj where he will receive 
a diploma next week 
i played sports in high school but my mother always told me 
to have something to fall back on which was an education he 
said 
before college i worked and worked to save money but 
outofstate tuition at rutgers was about 9000 at that time and 
i couldnt have swung it without help

in a diplomatic compromise accepted by both 
the united states and panama the organization of american states 
called for a transfer of power through democratic means in panama 
while leaving the details to a team of mediators 
the plan was unanimously authorized late wednesday by oas 
foreign ministers in a resolution that condemns the grave events 
and abuses by panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega but 
which also stops short of criticizing his government 
the resolution approved in an unusually efficient manner by the 
29 delegates present was sufficiently ambiguous to win the 
approval of the two biggest antagonists at the session secretary 
of state james a baker iii and panamanian foreign minister jorge 
ritter 
baker pronounced himself very pleased with the outcome 
ritter said i feel fully satisfied 
president bush responding to a question shouted by a reporter 
as he headed from the oval office to a helicopter this morning 
called the oas action a good resolution bush left for a 
fourday trip to new york boston and kennebunkport maine 
the presidents spokesman marlin fitzwater later told 
journalists on air force one that the resolution constitutes a 
condemnation of noriega by name for his abuses of the electoral 
process he added were gratified that the oas countries 
shared the united states position 
the key provision empowers the foreign ministers of ecuador 
guatemala and trinidad to try to promote a national accord 
within democratic mechanisms and in the shortest period possible 
to ensure the transfer of power with full respect for the sovereign 
will of panamanian people 
oas secretary general joao baena soares was asked to assist the 
delegation that will travel to the central american nation the 
organization issued a statement this afternoon saying the envoys 
will depart monday they were asked to report back by june 5 and 
the resolution said unspecified subsequent measures may be 
needed after june 5 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez speaking today from 
caracas on cbs this morning called the oas meeting the 
inauguration of new relations between the united states and the 
rest of the hemisphere because we have all agreed on a declaration 
defending democracy for latin america and we have all condemned the 
abuses commited in panama 
noriega is expected to tell the envoys that he never has opposed 
the fundamental purpose of the resolution a transfer of power 
through democratic means he is likely to claim the may 7 
presidential elections which he later ordered voided were 
designed to achieve that very goal 
the most divisive aspect of the proceeding centered on whether a 
direct reference to noriega was appropriate 
the initial draft of the resolution prepared by a 10nation 
delegation omitted any reference to noriega but the united states 
and other countries strongly opposed to noriega reversed that 
omission during a closed session of more than two hours paving the 
way for final approval 
the new language warned that the grave events and abuses by 
noriega could unleash an escalation of violence in panama 
the decision to include the reference to noriega was approved by 
a 202 vote with seven delegates abstaining the panamanian and 
nicaraguan delegates opposed the change in wording while the 
abstainers were from peru uruguay and five caribbean countries 
the nicaraguan delegate failed in two efforts to win approval of 
amendments assailing president bushs decision last week to send 
2000 more us troops to panama bushs stated purpose was to 
protect american lives 
ritter expressed satisfaction with the final resolution saying 
it fell far short of the us demand for a condemnation of the 
panamanian government he promised that the oas delegation would be 
welcomed by panamanian authorities 
noriegas critics have maintained he first tried to rig the 
outcome of the may 7 election in support of his candidate carlos 
duque then ordered the returns voided when he could no longer 
conceal the fraud government agents severely beat at least two 
opposition candidates a point noted in the resolution 
sen connie mack the florida republican who went to panama as 
an observer for the election attended the meeting at oas 
headquarters and termed the final resolution very positive but 
said he would have preferred an explicit demand that noriega step 
down 
the resolution marks a return to a key diplomatic assignment for 
ecuadoran foreign minister diego cordovez a member of the 
mediating team cordovez was the principal negotiator for the 
agreement that led to the withdrawal of soviet forces from 
afghanistan 
in contrast to other oas foreign ministers meetings this one 
was short on rhetoric and stressed substantive giveandtake 
baena soares had predicted wednesday morning the session could 
drag on until friday but the resolution was in its final form and 
approved by consensus at 1150 pm barely six hours after the 
formal proceeding had got under way

the state department praised greek and turkish 
forces on thursday for implementing a disengagement agreement in 
cyprus this week 
greek and turkish cypriot forces abandoned 24 military positions 
along a line dividing nicosia capital of the east mediterranean 
island 
the disengagement agreement brokered by the un peacekeeping 
force based on the island since 1964 was aimed at reducing tension 
along the buffer zone that runs through the old walled section of 
the city 
this represents an important practical step towards 
alleviating tensions and averting incidents it is a measure which 
we strongly supported said state department spokesman richard 
boucher 
we congratulate the parties concerned and the united nations 
which worked with them to bring about this success this 
deconfrontation agreement is the product of leadership and of 
vision he said 
boucher added that the united states hopes implementation of the 
initial phase of the agreement will enable progress on resolving 
the fundamental dispute over control of the island 
cyprus has been divided since july 1974 when the turkish army 
invaded after a shortlived coup by militant supporters of union 
with greece 
the turks seized the northern onethird of the island the 
minority turkish cypriots who make up 18 percent of the 650000 
population declared a breakaway republic there in 1983

a top higher education official called 
thursday for an end to athletic scholarships and shorter football 
basketball and baseball seasons as reforms needed to correct 
fundamental systemic problems in intercollegiate sports 
robert h atwell president of the american council on 
education the umbrella organization for the nations colleges and 
universities told congress that the scandals afflicting bigtime 
sports programs are not so much isolated cases as they are symptoms 
of a basically unhealthy enterprise 
in testimony to a house education and labor subcommittee atwell 
also proposed the elimination of freshman eligibility in football 
and basketball and the equal sharing among all schools of the 
television revenues now monopolized by the powerhouses 
first and foremost said atwell we must try to break the 
insidious connection between money and winning in bigtime 
college sports 
atwell was among several academic media and sports federation 
officials who testified before the and labor subcommittee on 
problems afflicting collegiate sports programs 
frank deford former senior editor for sports illustrated 
declared that bigtime college athletics has always been a 
scandal and always will be unless major changes are made it is a 
professional game which poses as amateur a big business which uses 
free labor 
deford rejected arguments that revenues generated by glamour 
sports benefits higher education as a whole rarely he said 
does any money raised for bigtime athletics leave the athletic 
department to enhance the university community 
atwell who said his proposals were his own and not those of the 
councils member institutions said there is a major set of 
systemic problems that must be addressed if we in higher education 
are serious about restoring public confidence in intercollegiate 
athletics 
some elements of the problem include an overemphasis on 
winning at the expense of other values an overconcern with 
spectator sports and spectator facilities as opposed to better 
facilities for and more emphasis on participation in lifelong 
fitness activities he said 
atwell faulted the news media for bestowing lavish attention 
upon bigtime college sports while giving short shrift to 
virtually everything else 
he lauded the national collegiate athletic association for 
recent enforcement actions and stiffened eligibility requirements 
but the fact remains that too many programs and too many coaches 
still care more about eligibility than education he said 
dick schultz executive director of the ncaa said im not 
here to tell you there are not problems ranging from drug abuse 
to academic and monetary cheating but the ncaa has not been 
sitting idly by he added 
jeff farris executive director of the national association of 
intercollegiate athletics noted that all member institutions in 
the naia are required to conduct drug education programs and are 
barred from accepting gifts from makers of alcohol and tobacco 
products 
atwell said all college basketball games should be played after 
christmas and before march 15 and declared that any more than 85 
baseball games is simply incompatible with the studentathlete 
ideal he did not specify how much he would shorten the football 
season but said the notion of a postseason college football 
playoff now being explored by the college football association is 
a perfectly awful idea 
sen bill bradley dnj testified before the panel in behalf 
of his legislation to require college recruiters to disclose to 
highschool prospects and the public at large their record for 
graduating student athletes broken down by sport race and sex 
bradley cited a recent usa today survey which found that 
division 1 basketball players for example graduate at a rate of 
only 17 percent the challenge of a college experience said 
bradley a former allamerica and nba pro should not be making 
the team but preparing to be a good citizen friend and family 
member

a san francisco attorney will remain under 
senate consideration as a federal judge despite a thumbs down from 
homestate sen alan cranston the chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee said thursday 
sen joseph biden ddel said cranston has submitted a 
negative blue slip on the nomination of vaughn walker which 
under the customs that once prevailed within the senate would have 
been sufficient to put an immediate end to the lawyers candidacy 
for the bench 
but biden said i have no desire to hold up walker 
still biden said the opposition from cranston will affect 
walker negatively and the nomination was held back thursday as 
the committee sent all other current judicial nominees to the full 
senate with favorable recommendations 
cranston dcalif has sought to sidetrack walkers nomination 
to the us district court saying that last year before the 
committee walker went too far in defending a private club that has 
been alleged to discriminate against women and that he was too slow 
to resign from membership 
californias other senator republican pete wilson has urged 
confirmation of walker 
according to biden the custom of allowing a single member of 
the judiciary committee to kill a judicial nomination ended when 
sen edward m kennedy dmass became chairman 
biden said that under his own chairmanship one negative blue 
slip from a homestate senator could veto a candidate only if the 
administration had failed to consult with senators before making 
the nomination 
he said such consultation would have to be serious if its 
perfunctory theres going to be a problem biden said 
the nominations sent to the full senate were those of pamela ann 
rhymer of los angeles and ferdinand f fernandez as judges of the 
9th us circuit court of appeals robert c bonner of pasadena 
calif as a judge of the us district court for the central 
district of california and melinda f harmon of houston as a judge 
of the district court for the southern district of texas 
biden said it was unclear when walker would get a new hearing 
he said questions had been raised by the committee staff and he had 
not reviewed them to determine if they were worth pursuing at the 
cost of further delay 
walker was a member of san franciscos olympic club until feb 
1 when he resigned saying he had enjoyed being a member but 
unfortunately the clubs present membership practices are 
wrongly based on a policy of exclusion 
he said the club has certainly recently demonstrated that 
race ethnicity religion and other arbitrary factors do not play a 
role in club membership 
nonetheless he added i as a member of the club have 
been disappointed that the club has not taken longer strides toward 
making full membership status available to women

more than 40 percent of the nations 
physicians are limiting their charges for medicare patients the 
health care financing administration said thursday 
hcfa said 283475 physicians 407 percent of the 696848 
doctors who bill medicare signed agreements with the government 
in january saying they would not charge medicare patients more than 
the government reimburses 
the proportion of physicians agreeing to such limits has been 
climbing up from 373 percent last year 306 percent in 1987 and 
283 percent in 1986 as medicare has added incentives to bring 
more doctors on board 
the incentives for participating physicians include a 5 percent 
pay differential speedier payments and a listing in healthcare 
directories made available to medicare beneficiaries 
the current incentives seem to be working said louis b 
hays acting administrator of hcfa were up to just over 80 
percent of all physician spending under medicare being done by 
assigned claims at the medicareapproved rate 
at the same time however the american medical association says 
more physicians are beginning to restrict their medicare practices 
because government reimbursement rates in the program are too low 
an ama report released this week estimates that between 1984 and 
1987 about 13 percent of physicians reduced medicare patient 
access because of the amount the government pays for the services 
and limits on what they can charge medicare patients beyond the 
reimbursed charges 
the changes medicare has made in the last few years are 
resulting in doctors reducing the amount of care to which medicare 
patients have access said dr lonnie bristow an ama trustee 
from san pablo calif 
medicare patients can go to any doctor they want but when they 
see a participating physician the patients know they will not 
have to pay the difference between medicares approved amount and 
the doctors usual charge 
hays attributed much of the increase to the law of ecnomics 
as beneficiaries discover the advantages to them of utilizing 
a particular physician its logical that more would become 
participating physicians in order to stay competitive he said 
physicians who do not sign participation agreements can still 
treat medicare patients and decide on a claimbyclaim basis 
whether to accept the medicareapproved amount as payment in full 
the participation rate varies widely from state to state 
alabama has the highest rate with 76 percent of its physicians 
agreeing to charge the medicareapproved rate for all their 
medicare patients but in idaho only 16 percent have agreed to 
participate fully in the program 
overall physician participation rates increased in 44 states 
this year and by 20 percent or more in seven states hcfa said

a woman whose baby son was adopted in 1963 
by billy tipton has sued the late jazz musicians estate because 
tipton turned out to be a woman posing as a man 
patricia clark in the suit filed wednesday in superior court 
alleged tipton defrauded her by promising to be a good father to 
the boy jon clark 
tiptons death in january from a bleeding ulcer revealed that 
the leader of a jazz trio was a woman 
tipton believed to be 75 years old at death had apparently 
assumed a mans identity early in life in hope of succeeding in the 
maledominated field of jazz 
ms clark said she felt angry and betrayed when she learned 
tiptons secret she said her fragile relationship with her son 
who has known she was his mother since 1986 has been shattered 
she is seeking unspecified damages 
jon clark however said that hes never been close to ms clark 
and that she might be another of many people trying to profit from 
tiptons story 
i owe my dad and i dont owe anyone else jon clark said 
i really want people to know what kind of person he was its too 
bad we all have to fight and argue after someone like him dies 
kitty oakes who lived as tiptons wife after 1960 until they 
separated about 10 years ago said there is no basis for the 
lawsuit 
nobody committed fraud said ms oakes executor of the 
estate i never met her before the adoption and nobody lied to 
her shes just out to make a buck 
l neil axtell ms clarks attorney said the estate is worth 
about 150000 but could increase because of movie tv and tabloid 
offers the family has received since tiptons death 
tipton a pianist and saxophone player traveled throughout the 
west with the billy tipton trio in the 1950s before settling in 
spokane and becoming a musicians agent

after a package of candy was found to contain semtex a plastic 
explosive 
it did not identify the candy and gave no further details of the 
find british newspapers published a transport department security 
memo identifying the candy as halawa and saying it is similar 
in color and texture to semtex 
the czechoslovakmade explosive is odorless hard to detect and 
can be molded into any shape 
arabic radio pronounced the name of the candy halwa it is 
manufactured by companies throughout the middle east and is 
packaged in tins and plastic tubes 
newspapers quoted unidentified security officials as saying they 
feared semtex in a candy package could be taken on board perhaps 
by a child and left with a delayed timer for a later flight 
three months ago the government recommended airline checks on 
transistor radios portable computers cassette recorders and other 
electrical and electronic equipment after investigators announced 
that pan am flight 103 had been destroyed by plastic explosive 
built into a radiocassette player

their concentration slip for a moment he said we just dont 
know where the next threat is coming from and therefore have to 
check anything out of the ordinary 
the security memo published in full by the daily express said 
the explosive could be molded to the shape of the circular candy 
containers which are eight inches in diameter six inches deep and 
and large enough to contain all the components of an ied 
improvised explosive device 
arming is achieved by pulling a pin accessible through a small 
hole in the casing the newspaper quoted the memo as saying 
such an item should feel heavier than expected 
airlines should be alert to the possibility of such a device 
being left on board aircraft at transit stops it quoted the memo 
as saying 
the transport department is testing a computer which its 
developer science applications international corp of california 
claims can detect any explosive semtex is transparent to 
conventional xray detection 
the device is undergoing trials at harwell nuclear research 
center in western england and will be introduced in british 
airports if the trials show the machine is safe and effective said

the senate agriculture committee chairman 
pledged on thursday that there would be quick action on rural 
development measures that could provide 100 million a year in 
loans to stimulate businesses 
this legislation will in many ways determine whether we have a 
rural america worth saving as we move into the next century said 
sen patrick leahy dvt 
in addition to providing federal seed money for local revolving 
loan funds the proposed rural partnerships act of 1989 would 
earmark 200 million this year to improve education health 
services communications and utilities in rural areas to encourage 
business development 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has promised to 
move the legislation to the senate floor in late june to ensure its 
passage this year leahy said at a news conference where he was 
joined by six of the bills 23 cosponsors 
there have been some hard times in the heartland this bill 
sends forth a message of hope said sen kent conrad dnd 
architect of the legislations lending program 
the 100 million in seed money would be aimed at encouraging 
banks to increase investments in new or expanding businesses in 
rural areas 
the federal funds would be matched by money from the private 
sector and put into revolving funds for loans loan guarantees and 
investments in businesses with fewer than 100 employees 
the revolving funds would be operated by states local 
governments or economic development groups assuring local control 
of the lending program sponsors said 
other provisions would provide money to 
upgrade telephone lines so rural businesses would have access 
to such services as digital switching and fiber optics necessary 
for some computer operations 
improve health care and education with telecommunications links 
to rural hospitals and schools 
assist communities to comply with federal water standards 
the 300 million package is a modest step forward that 
recognizes federal budget constraints leahy said he had said he 
wanted to put 500 million into the program 
were dealing with the realities of the budget and 300 
million is a lot better than nothing and thats the 
alternative he said

the peronist party which swept 
recent presidential elections will work with the outgoing 
government to bring the faltering economy under control 
presidentelect carlos menem said thursday 
we are not assuming any compromises menem said after 
meeting with president raul alfonsin for the first time since his 
sunday victory we are simply trying together with the national 
government to alleviate this situation 
the battered economy was the principal issue in the presidential 
campaign and the chief issue that defeated government candidate 
eduardo angeloz 
in a first joint step economists representing both governments 
will travel to the united states for negotiations on argentinas 
59 billion foreign debt with creditor banks menem said 
no details were disclosed but they were expected to discuss 
arrearages estimated at about 35 billion and new loans which 
have been blocked for nearly a year 
the meeting between menem of the peronist party and alfonsin 
of the radical civic union was part of an attempt by both parties 
to stabilize argentinas troubled economy until menems sixyear 
term begins on dec 10 
peronist party economic proposals call for a social pact 
among workers businessmen and the government and a vague 
productive revolution to generate employment double 
agricultural harvests and exploit natural resources 
all will require significant sacrifice from argentines and menem 
cant risk losing public support by being seen to support failed 
radical civic union policies 
but the economic problems are so pressing the peronists cant 
sit on the sidelines either the national budget deficit is vast 
inflation might top 50 percent this month and the currency the 
austral continues its spectacular devaluation 
the government has not paid interest on its foreign debt since 
late last year and principal payments were deferred several years 
ago this year interest bills amount to 6 billion about twice 
the expected trade surplus and foreign exchange reserves in the 
central bank are very low menem said 
were not betting on this governments failure peronist 
national deputy and potential economy minister edward bauza said 
wednesday after the party endorsed utility price increases needed 
to shore up the budget 
in addition menem hopes to quell uncertainty about his 
workeroriented policies rumors about them helped to spur the 
dramatic devaluation of the currency in the last months 
our government is not going to embargo deposits nor 
confiscate foreign exchange nor open security boxes or anything 
like that said eduardo menem a national senator brother and 
key advisor to the presidentelect 
economic problems are generating political pressures 
the 4 millionmember general labor confederation which backed 
menem in the election is demanding that the monthly minimum wage 
be raised by 125 percent to the equivalent of about 64 by june 1 
some commuter trains were disrupted wednesday by wildcat 
strikes and bus owners in the capital threaten to strike next week 
if they are not allowed to raise fares

the military announced a new crackdown thursday 
restricting palestinian access to israel and providing an economic 
weapon officials hope will help persuade arabs to abandon their 
violent revolt 
the army will issue special permits allowing some of the 700000 
gaza strip residents into israel and may expand the measure to 1 
million palestinians on the occupied west bank military officials 
said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin indicated leaders of the uprising 
will be denied permits 
leftist lawmakers warned the restrictions could stir new 
violence and some employers feared they could have a negative 
impact on israels economy 
in the occupied territories troops killed two young arabs 
they shot and fatally wounded 20yearold imran najib amer and 
abdel razik abu khollah 22 arab hospital officials said the army 
said amer was among masked palestinians who blocked a west bank 
road and that he was shot as he tried to grab a soldiers rifle 
they said they were checking the report on khollah who officials 
said died in a clash with troops in gazas nuseirat refugee camp 
their deaths bring the toll to 484 palestinians killed in the 
17month revolt twentyone israelis also have been killed 
in other confrontations thursday troops shot and wounded at 
least 26 palestinians arabs and hospital officials said the army 
confirmed three wounded 
most of the occupied lands were paralyzed by a general strike 
called by the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas or zeal to 
protest alleged israeli interference with mosques 
army commanders say they avoid entering mosques but they close 
off access to some when they anticipate hostile crowds 
the army thursday partially lifted a general curfew that had 
restricted gaza strip residents to their homes since monday 
but officers reimposed the curfew thursday night for no 
special reason according to an army spokesman it would last 
until further notice he said 
military officers say the gaza closure and permit requirements 
are to punish palestinians for antiisraeli activities 
prime minister yitzhak shamir an architect of the plan said on 
israel television thursday that the palestinians must choose 
between the intefadeh uprising and the path of peace 
he told leaders of his rightwing likud bloc wednesday that 
cabinet approval of a peace initiative means israel now can take 
tougher measures against violence 
when you have a peace initiative in one hand the other is 
freer to strike at the rioters shamir said 
in an interview thursday defense minister yitzhak rabin said 
the aim is to deliver a message to the palestinians that 
stonethrowing petrolbombing and other means of violence do not 
change a bit the israeli political position 
military officials said they will use the new permits to bar 
gaza strip residents convicted of serious crimes some 28000 
palestinians have been convicted of crimes in israel in the past 10 
years officials said 
rabin indicated ringleaders in the revolt also would not get 
permits 
he said the army could start issuing permits by the end of may 
and expected the process to be completed within three months 
they might expande restrictions to the west bank to make the 
palestinians in gaza and later on the west bank realize that the 
right to leave the territories is a privilege he said 
there are too many sectors of israels economy which have 
become in my humble opinion too dependent on the workers who come 
from the territories rabin said 
restrictions will most affect 50000 gazan and 60000 west bank 
residents working in israel in construction farming municipal 
services hotels and factories 
in 1987 palestinians working in israel earned 700 million 
about one third of the gross national produce of the occupied 
territories rabin said 
finance minister shimon peres head of rabins centerleft labor 
party said israel could not keep all work from palestinians 
because it would create more bitterness and resistance 
israeli industrialists fear the new measures will leave them 
short of labor some have appealed for permits to bring lowwage 
workers from abroad including lebanon and portugal 
the construction industry is in a catastrophic situation 
aharon sapir directorgeneral of the contractors association said 
on israel radio members of his association employ 40000 
palestinians about half their work force 
leftwing legislators condemned the new crackdown which yossi 
sarid of the citizens rights movement described as stupid 
unjust ineffective and immoral

president mikhail s gorbachev of the 
soviet union completed a visit to china on thursday that opened a 
new era of good will after three decades of estrangement between 
the two great communist powers 
gorbachev flew home from shanghai a city of 12 million people 
where he visited the minhang special economic zone an area set 
aside for foreign investment 
he toured the shanghai mitsubishi elevator co factory a joint 
venture of chinese and japanese manufacturing firms in the zone 
as part of his own economic reforms gorbachev seeks to 
encourage soviet enterprises to modernize by taking foreign 
partners in joint ventures similar to those china has launched with 
considerable success 
a joint communique issued when he left said gorbachevs meetings 
with deng xiaoping and other chinese leaders symbolized the 
normalization of relations between the two countries 
china and the soviet union split 30 years over who should lead 
the communist world and remained at odds because of border 
disputes conflicting strategic interests soviet military 
intervention in afghanistan and the vietnamese invasion of cambodia 
gorbachevs fourday visit which both sides described as 
historic occurred in the shadow of a huge prodemocracy upheaval 
in which up to 1 million protesters took over the streets of 
central beijing 
to keep him away from the demonstrators scheduled events were 
moved to other locations or canceled 
tass the official soviet news agency issued a report after 
gorbachevs departure saying chinese police had lost control of 
the crowds occupying central tiananmen square and main streets 
leading into it 
the official chinese agency xinhua said gorbachev in 
conversation with vice premier wu xueqian before leaving wished 
the current situation in china to be eased and settled 
in several speeches the kremlin leader said social unrest 
experienced by the soviet union and other communist nations was a 
natural consequence of more liberal policies he said 
democratization was crucial to the success of economic reform 
in the joint communique the two nations announced restoration 
of contacts between their communist parties and elevated talks on 
longstanding border disputes to the foreign minister level 
they pledged to take measurse to cut down the military forces 
in the areas along the sinosoviet boundary to a minimum level 
commensurate with the normal goodneighborly relations between the 
two countries 
while in beijing gorbachev proposed complete demilitarization 
of the 4300mile frontier now guarded by about 600000 soviet and 
1 million chinese soldiers 
the largest section of the communique concerned cambodia the 
last and most serious obstacle china posed to normal relations with 
moscow china agreed to the summit only after the kremlin began 
pushing its ally vietnam toward ending its 10year occupation of 
cambodia 
soviet officials said talks on the communique bogged down over 
language regarding cambodia where china supports rebel forces and 
in the end the two sides agreed to differ 
china repeated its support for a provisional government led by 
prince norodom sihanouk head of the threeparty guerrilla 
alliance and including both the resistance and the hanoisponsored 
administration of premier hun sen 
the soviet union said only that internal problems including 
preparation for general elections under international supervision 
should be solved by the cambodians themselves 
they agreed that civil war should be avoided after the 
vietnamese withdrawal now scheduled to be finished by sept 30 
and outside parties should gradually end military aid to the

a federal judge has ruled that the city of 
lawrence violated the constitution by confiscating welfare id cards 
from a drug suspect 
lawrence mayor kevin sullivan had ordered four months ago that 
police gather evidence of possible welfare fraud whenever anyone is 
suspected of any crime the cards were to be turned over to state 
welfare authorities for investigation 
sullivan said his depressed former mill town of 61000 people is 
too small and poor to be as easy on welfare cheats as he claims the 
state is 
on tuesday us district judge david nelson ruled that the city 
violated the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable 
search and seizure when it took welfare ids belonging to maria 
ocasio a 47yearold mother of 11 
police in lawrence 30 miles north of boston searched ms 
ocasios home march 7 with a warrant to look for drugs and seized 
11 bags of cocaine six bags of marijuana two marijuana 
cigarettes 18 needles and syringes and 481 in cash 
the police also took four welfare identification cards ms 
ocasio receives federal benefits for her children food stamps and 
medical benefits 
judge david nelson ruled that police had no right to take the 
cards because they had no cause to suspect ms ocasio of welfare 
fraud 
ms ocasio never was charged with welfare fraud 
ms ocasio has her cards back and never lost her benefits her 
lawyer said but along with the father of some of her children 
wilfredo santiago she faces cocaine and marijuana charges she is 
free on her own recognizance 
barbara lybarger who represented ms ocasio said about 120 
people have been affected some after such petty crimes as 
shoplifting and disorderly conduct 
mayor sullivan said police must be more careful about protecting 
peoples rights but he defended his policy in principle 
we felt the department of welfare was negligent in 
investigating cases where drug dealers were getting access to the 
welfare system while making huge amounts of money sullivan said 
in an interview 
the state tends to be soft on crime through its human 
services department by encouraging this type of activity making 
it easy to get on welfare with little or no checking 
he said 13000 people are on welfare in lawrence the city is 
trying to make an incentive to work but the commonwealth is making 
an incentive not to work sullivan said 
a state official said the mayor is wrong but reacting to hard 
times 
his city is in need when times are tough and money gets 
tight we see the syndrome of blame the victim said michal 
regunberg spokeswoman for the state department of public welfare 
its no picnic to be on welfare 
there are strict eligibility requirements for all welfare 
ms regunberg said someone cant just walk in off the street and 
get welfare and what were talking about here by and large is 
children twothirds of people on welfare are children 
the mayor would have us believe healthy males can walk in and 
get relief 
ms lybarger said she has been a legal aid lawyer specializing 
in government benefits cases since 1972 and never heard of a policy 
as sweeping as sullivans 
there are probably people making enough money from drugs that 
they are not eligible for welfare and they should be investigated 
this policy has taken much too broad a sweep at this problem ms 
lybarger said

senators from wheatgrowing states introduced 
relief legislation thursday for farmers whose winter crops have 
been devastated by this years drought 
our bill is simple and straightforward said sen bob dole 
rkan we believe it is time to extend the 1988 relief act to 
crops planted in 1988 but harvested in 1989 he said it would 
cover mostly winter wheat 
provisions would be administered along the lines of last year 
concerning payment rates benefits and requirements on federal crop 
insurance participation in future years dole said 
the legislation also calls for 25 million to transport 
livestock to areas where feed and water exist and 25 million for 
livestock producers who have had to spend money on emergency water 
projects 
money saved under the deficiency payment program would be used 
to cover the cost of the legislation 
sen david boren dokla said about 500 million in federal 
deficiency payments was saved because of higher market prices on 
wheat the money would have gone to farmers if wheat prices had 
been below the federally set target price 
joining dole and boren in sponsoring were sens nancy landon 
kassebaum rkan don nickles rokla lloyd bentsen dtexas

pilots with drunken driving records would be 
grounded under rules the federal aviation administration proposed 
thursday 
the rules which are open to modification before becoming final 
later this year would deny an application or suspend a pilots 
certificate if records show two drivers license revocations or 
drunken driving convictions within a threeyear period due to 
alcohol or drug use 
faa studies show that more than 10000 licensed pilots have 
drunken driving records but officials said they had not determined 
how many might be affected by the new rules last month the faa 
announced a crackdown on more than 1000 pilots who had failed to 
report drunken driving arrests as required on their applications 
for required medical certificates 
the announcement follows concerns raised by the national 
transportation safety board over pilots who were allowed to fly 
even though their drivers licenses had been suspended for drunken 
driving 
the faa rule would require a pilot to report any action against 
his drivers license related to alcohol or drug use up to three 
years before the rule takes effect 
failure to report subsequent actions within 60 days after they 
occur would be grounds for a pilot losing his license to fly 
the rule would become final later this year if it passes a 
public comment period and further analysis by faa lawyers said 
agency spokeswoman joann sloane 
the faa said a comparison of pilot medical records with the 
national driver register showed that the drivers licenses of 
10300 of the more than 700000 active pilots had been suspended or 
revoked in the preceding seven years for drunken driving 
more than threefourths of those did not report the convictions 
to the faa when applying for a medical certificate to fly although 
such a report is required the agency said 
the new rule also would cause a pilots medical certificate to 
expire 61 days after a single drunken driving conviction and 
require reapplication with proof that the pilot was enrolled in an 
alcoholtreatment program

the pentagons automated information systems 
have been plagued by cost overruns and schedule delays and the 
department has submitted inaccurate estimates to congress the 
comptroller general said thursday 
charles a bowsher told the house government operations 
subcommittee on legislation and national security that a study of 
eight automated systems that will be used to account for billions 
of dollars in logistics and personnel resources found significant 
cost increases 
the office of the secretary of defense estimated the cost to 
develop and deploy the systems at about 1 billion but that has 
almost doubled bowsher said further increases in cost are likely 
he said 
in addition completion dates for all but one system have been 
delayed by three to seven years and none of the systems are 
scheduled to be deployed completely until the early 1990s 
from my perspective these problems indicate that defense is 
not effectively controlling major system development efforts and 
that the office of the secretary of defense is not rigorously 
enforcing established oversight policies bowsher said 
bowsher who also heads the general accounting office said the 
congressional watchdog agency found that cost estimates submitted 
to congress were not in all cases accurate current or 
complete 
specifically the navy submitted an estimate of 91 million for 
its integrated disbursing and accounting system but an internal 
navy estimate of developing deploying and maintaining the system 
was 879 million 
the gao also found that the pentagon developed new systems 
rather than considering and maximizing the use of existing 
systems to avoid duplication and unnecessary expenditures 
bowsher said 
i continue to be amazed and appalled by such revelations 
said rep john conyers jr dmich chairman of the subcommittee 
cynthia kendall deputy comptroller of information resources 
management in the defense department said the pentagon discussed 
the automated systems with the subcommittee last september and 
since then has continued to pursue improved policies and 
management 
kendall also said the departments comptroller has set up a 
quarterly reporting system that includes certification of costs 
schedules and other information

the supreme court on thursday disposed of a 
florida case that sparked some unusual judicial acts and widespread 
speculation about justice anthony m kennedys views on abortion 
all in all the case may be far less consequential outside the 
sunshine state than some claimed 
nevertheless the case illustrated vividly how potentially 
explosive any abortionrelated dispute has become as the nation 
awaits a supreme court ruling on the fate of roe vs wade its 1973 
decision legalizing abortion 
the court is being asked in a missouri case to overturn or 
curtail roe vs wade which said women have a constitutional right 
to end their pregnancies a decision is expected by late june 
into this mix was thrown the case of tw a 15yearold florida 
girl who earlier this month sought a state judges permission to 
have an abortion 
like some two dozen other states florida requires unwed minors 
still dependent on their parents to get the consent of their 
parents or a judge before obtaining an abortion 
the supreme court has upheld parentalconsent and 
parentalnotification abortion laws if such a judicial bypass 
is included but the florida law was deemed defective and 
therefore invalid by a state judge and a state appals court 
the florida supreme court has agreed to review the law in 
september but refused to let officials enforce it until then 
before invalidating the law state judge jerry lockett did a 
peculiar thing he appointed a lawyer to serve as a guardian for 
tws fetus even though no provision in florida law calls for such 
an appointment 
it was that guardian who tuesday sought help from kennedy who 
handles emergency matters from florida for the high court 
kennedy is the courts newest member and his views on abortion 
are not known his is considered a key swing vote in the missouri 
case 
judges usually take no action in a case until certain they have 
the authority what lawyers call jurisdiction kennedys authority 
in tws case was questionable for two reasons 
first the matter was pending before the state supreme court 
second the emergency request came from a lawyer for a fetus 
the justices consistently have ruled that a fetus is not a 
person under the constitution and until late in a pregnancy 
when it is capable of surviving outside the womb has no legal 
rights 
kennedy issued a stay in effect reinstating the florida law 
and blocking tws abortion until the stay was lifted by the full 
supreme court two days later 
speculation immediately centered on the justices motive 
was he tipping his hand as an abortion foe molly yard 
president of the national organization for women was among those 
who thought so 
she said her group has never doubted that justice kennedy is 
hostile to the constitutional concept of the right to abortion and 
his action today bears out that evaluation 
others however note that kennedy referred tws case to the 
full court even as he issued the stay and then apparently did not 
dissent when the court set aside his action 
perhaps kennedy was proceeding with caution in light of the 
missouri case being deliberated and two other parentalconsent 
cases still pending before the court we likely will never know

jurors who cleared a liquor company of negligence 
for failing to warn a pregnant woman about the dangers of drinking 
say they felt little sympathy for her 
members of the federal jury wednesday said candance thorp should 
have known drinking while pregnant could harm her unborn child 
mrs thorp and her husband harold sought about 4 million from 
jim beam brands co for lifetime care for their 4yearold son 
michael born with deformities retardation and other problems 
categorized as symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome 
i was surprised they were actually suing jim beam said 
juror staci gilbreth i know that jim beam whiskey was what she 
drank the most but my gosh we wondered if it was just that jim 
beam had the most money 
they could have sued everyone said geraldine jackson 
another juror referring to testimony mrs thorp was seen drinking 
beer in bars several times during her pregnancy 
mrs thorp 39 testified she was an alcoholic who drank as much 
as half a fifth of jim beam a day during her pregnancy but said 
she would have stopped drinking if warning labels meant for 
pregnant women were on the bottles 
were obviously disappointed with the verdict but the jury 
system operates said the thorps lawyer barry epstein 
no decision was made on an appeal he said 
during the trial epstein said the alcohol company had an 
obligation to warn the public of the risks of drinking while 
pregnant 
witnesses said mrs thorp was warned repeatedly by relatives and 
friends about the dangers and that she and other alcoholics would 
not have heeded a warning on a label 
jurors said they decided the danger of to unborn babies was 
common knowledge and said that was a factor in their decision to 
deny damages 
attorneys said the case was the first against a liquor company 
for birth defects linked to alcohol two similar cases are pending 
in washington state courts 
about 1 percent of the infants born in the united states each 
year or 35000 babies are born with fetal alcohol syndrome 
symptoms include slow growth central nervous system impairment 
hyperactivity retardation and facial deformities 
a federal law goes into effect in november requiring that all 
bottles of liquor wine and beer to carry a label warning that 
drinking while pregnant may be hazardous to fetuses

investigators who linked him to a corruption probe 
are lying a former member of the communist partys ruling 
politburo said in a statement released thursday 
the statement by mikhail s solomentsev who was retired from 
the politburo in september was read at a regular briefing by 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev 
i believe it is my party and civic duty to state that the 
assertions by the investigators of the ussr procurator 
generals office are a brazen provocation a vile and downright 
base lie the statement said 
never and under no circumstances had i given a pretext for 
such accusations 
before his retirement solomentsev was in charge of the party 
control commission which disciplines party members who violate 
rules 
his statement followed by two days a denial by politburo member 
yegor k ligachev who has been considered a conservative 
counterweight to president mikhail s gorbachev and a potential 
rival 
perfiliev also read ligachevs statement which previously had 
been distributed by novosti news agency 
solomentsev and ligachev were reacting to statements made by 
criminal investigators telman gdlyan and nikolai ivanov who are 
famous throughout the soviet union for their probe into corruption 
in uzbekistan 
both ligachev and solomentsev said they demanded an 
investigation of the charges and that the results be published 
gdlyan was elected to the new congress of peoples deputies 
parliament in march with about 87 percent of the vote in a moscow 
region 
on sunday two days after mentioning ligachev and solomentsev in 
connection with the continuing investigation ivanov won 61 percent 
of the vote in a race among more than two dozen candidates in 
leningrad

the ranking republican on the house armed 
services committee called thursday for an early congressional 
showdown over president bushs plan to proceed with development of 
two kinds of landbased nuclear missiles 
rep bill dickinson rala asked defense secretary dick cheney 
to seek congressional approval if he intends to use money 
designated for deployment of the railmobile mx missile to keep the 
midgetman missile program alive for the remainder of fiscal 1989 
dickinson said in a statement that such a request would give 
midgetman opponents a mechanism to kill it in the weeks ahead 
unless a longerterm deal to ratify the presidents package is 
struck 
in last years defense budget bill congress provided 250 
million for the midgetman and 600 million for the raidbased mx 
program but directed that no more than 250 million of the mx 
money could be spent before feb 15 
the remaining 350 million was supposed to have been reallocated 
after the new president decided whether to pursue one program the 
other or both 
cheney initially recommended that the midgetman be scrapped but 
bush bowing to pressure from congressional democrats who support 
the small singlewarhead missile opted to proceed with both 
programs but to deploy the 50 mx missiles in rail cars first 
in his new pentagon budget request for fiscal 1990 bush calls 
for 12 million for deployment of the mx and 100 million to 
continue research and development of the midgetman 
dickinson who backed cheneys recommendation for cancellation 
of the midgetman said he supports bushs compromise package but 
does not want to see the missile debate drag on for months while 
democrats maneuver to increase funding for the midgetman 
my tolerance for any attempt to plusup the midgetman and thus 
undermine the presidents politically and fiscally acceptable 
compromise is zero dickinson said if these attempts continue 
i will work as hard as i can to kill the program outright 
some democrats who have supported the midgetman indicated after 
bush announced his compromise decision last month that they might 
join republican opponents in efforts to kill the missile rather 
than support funding two programs in a period of intense fiscal 
constaints 
cheney has told congress it will cost about 350 million to keep 
the midgetman program alive for the remainder of fiscal 1989 100 
million more than was authorized last year dickinson said any 
reallocation of mx money to make up the difference must be approved 
by congress

david s ruder announced his resignation 
thursday as chairman of the securities and exchange commission 
after guiding the agency through two tumultuous years that included 
the 1987 stock market crash and a historic investigation of 
corruption on wall street 
ruder in a letter to president bush said he planned to return 
to the faculty of northwestern university school of law at the end 
of august he left there in august 1987 to head the sec which 
regulates the nations financial markets and oversees disclosure 
requirements for us publicly traded corporations 
the date of his resignation depends on when his successor is 
appointed he gave no reason for leaving but bush had been widely 
expected to name someone else to the post even though senior 
democrats in congress were urging that ruder stay on his term 
expires in june 1991 
on the list of possible successors are attorney thomas a russo 
a former division director at the commodity futures trading 
commission edward h fleischman who already holds a seat on the 
fivemember sec and kraft inc chairman john m richman of chicago 
white house spokesman bj cooper said the administration was 
reviewing the appointment and declined further comment 
in his letter to bush dated thursday ruder said it was crucial 
that the commission have vigorous and strong leadership 
when ruder 60 took over the sec he had a reputation as a 
respected legal expert and as former dean of the northwestern law 
school as a skilled administrator 
that skill was tested a little more than two months later on 
oct 19 1987 when the stock market crashed registering a record 
508point decline on the dow jones average of industrial stocks 
ruder who had little experience operating in the national media 
spotlight was sharply criticized by congressional committee 
chairmen for talking with reporters on the day of the crash about 
possibility of a trading halt some analysts said his remarks 
squashed a recovery attempt by the market and deepened the plunge 
while ruder maintained he was misquoted 
however in the debate over market reform that followed ruder 
soon won friends among democrats on capitol hill for hewing a 
somewhat independent line from the freemarket reagan 
administration 
the white house and treasury departments resisted any attempt to 
combine the regulation of stock and futures markets which are 
regulated with a lighter hand by the cftc ruder alone among top 
administration officials argued that stock and futures markets are 
closely linked and that his agency should coordinate regulation of 
both 
also in the wake of an outcry from small investors who lost 
money in the crash he pushed the securities industry to improve 
its system of arbitrating disputes with customers and to take other 
steps to restore public confidence 
in the end the reagan administration view prevailed on market 
reform proposals but rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
house energy and commerce committee praised ruder for 
understanding the importance of maintaining public confidence 
he was a fine chairman and i hope someone of his integrity 
ability and orientation will succeed him said dingell who had 
urged bush to reappoint ruder 
i thought he brought an unusually scholarly and calm 
perspective to one of the more turbulent times in the markets 
history he probably will be respected more for what he didnt do 
rather than for what he did do namely he didnt overreact said 
roberick m hills chairman of the sec under the administation of 
president ford 
william proxmire former chairman of the senate banking 
committee had opposed ruders nomination but now says that was a 
mistake 
frankly i think he worked out well proxmire said ruder 
believes strongly in regulation he believes that securities 
issuers should be vigorously required to provide information to 
investors and if they dont they should be penalized fined or 
jailed less regulation rather than more 
ruder had he stayed faced presiding over a commission that 
likely would have been increasingly out of sync with his views 
ronald reagan a month before leaving the presidency replaced 
aulana peters a ruder ally with mary schapiro a former futures 
industry lobbyist the term of charles c cox another frequent 
ruder ally has expired and his nomination by reagan was never 
acted on 
ruder also broke from the administration in seeking large 
increases in his agencys budget which had remained static while 
stock and bond trading mushroomed 
gary g lynch the 38yearold attorney who heads the secs 
enforcement division announced his own resignation effective 
midjuly last week

president bush told three leading south 
african foes of apartheid thursday that he would press in every 
way possible to end that nations system of racial separation 
his spokesman said but gave no indication of any change in us 
policy 
nonetheless the three men with whom bush met archbishop 
desmond tutu the rev allan boesak and the rev beyers naude 
said they were impressed that bush showed an open attitude to their 
concerns 
tutu who heads the anglican church in south africa was 
complimentary of bushs attitude and expressed hopes for progress 
with his administration 
i think there is a very warm openness and we think the door 
stands ajar no door has been slammed in our face tutu said 
after the 20minute meeting also attended by presidential chief of 
staff john sununu and national security adviser brent scowcroft 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
that bush continues to view additional sanctions against the 
minority white government of south africa as counterproductive 
tutu and his colleagues contrasted bushs attitude to that of 
his predecessor ronald reagan 
once reagan opposed economic sanctions against south africa 
boesak said antiapartheid activists felt there was no further 
possibility of even discussing the issue 
reagan vetoed the sanctions but congress overrode him they 
banned new us investment in south africa barred imports of south 
african coal steel uranium and textiles and prohibited south 
african airliners from landing in the united states 
tutu said after meeting with bush that he had urged the 
president to take the moral leadership toward ending apartheid 
we do not want to be overly optimistic tutu told reporters 
but he said he was impressed that bush wanted to be a catalyst 
for change and a positive influence 
boesak added the very fact that he values the opinion of 
those of us who represent black people in south africa that in 
itself is a sign that we did not get in the same measure from the 
previous administration 
tutu said there were no specific indications of a change away 
from reagan administration policies but the way we were 
received the fact that we were received was a hopeful sign 
the archbishop said the three asked bush to urge the pretoria 
government to negotiate with representatives of the south african 
black majority 
boesak spoke to bush about the need to give hope to young south 
africans and that touched a responsive cord tutu said 
we said we wanted the united states to take the moral 
leadership of the world in helping to end apartheid and bringing 
the south african government to the negotiating table the 
archbishop said 
to that end bush and congress should support new economic and 
diplomatic sanctions intended to pressure financially strapped 
south africa the group told a news conference 
boesak said the most effective sanctions would target the south 
african coal oil and goldmining industries 
the three clergymen said they did not specifically discuss 
sanctions with bush but do hope to have further talks with his 
administration 
speaking for the administration fitzwater said that officials 
will be looking at ways to best use american pressure influence 
and leverage to bring about justice and equality to south africa 
fitzwater said that the president shares the archbishops 
abhorrence of apartheid and had promised to stress his 
opposition to apartheid in every way possible 
meeting with reporters a day earlier fitzwater said bush sees 
further sanctions as counterproductive 
fitzwater said after thursdays meeting that bush had issued an 
invitation to albertina sisulu one of the leaders of the united 
democatic front in south africa to visit the united states 
she is restricted in her homeland meaning she cannot speak 
at public rallies or be quoted in news accounts state department 
officials denied the invitation was an attempt to provoke pretoria 
to give her a passport 
the thursday meeting came as us officials prepared for the 
visit of fw de klerk who is expected to succeed pw botha as 
president of south africa after botha resigns in september de 
klerk would be the first top south african leader to officially 
visit here in 30 years 
antiapartheid leaders are looking to de klerks ascendancy 
along with the new administration in washington as a window of 
opportunity for change de klerk has called for political reforms 
but opposes complete enfranchisement for blacks who comprise 85 
percent of the nations population

the bush administration is prepared to urge an 
escalation of pressure on panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
if he ignores an organization of american states call for a 
transfer of power us officials said thursday 
after oas foreign ministers approved a resolution on panama 
wednesday senior us officials met with latin american diplomats 
thursday to discuss strategy for dealing with noriega in the event 
he refuses to cooperate with oas mediators 
the key provision of the resolution empowers the mediators to 
try to promote a national accord within democratic mechanisms 
and in the shortest period possible to ensure the transfer of 
power with full respect for the sovereign will of panamanian 
people 
the resolution also blames noriega for grave events and 
abuses in panama since national elections were held on may 7 the 
election returns were tossed out amid allegations of widespread 
fraud 
one of the us officials commenting on condition he not be 
named said there was a simple reason why the ministers overcame an 
initial reluctance to criticize noriega by name in their resolution 
nobody there disagreed with the proposition that we ought to 
try to get rid of noriega he said 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter promised his government 
will cooperate fully with the mediators but there was little 
expectation here that the negotiation will go smoothly 
if it becomes apparent that noriega is intent on clinging to 
power the resolution allows for subsequent measures to be 
taken against him 
the officials pointed out that a decade ago it took three oas 
foreign ministers meetings to win approval of a resolution calling 
for the resignation of thennicaraguan president anastasio somoza 
they suggested that if noriega responds to the wednesday night 
resolution by digging in his heels the oas could take the same 
action against noriega that it did against somoza in 1979 
the officials said noriega will have difficulty attempting to 
portray his governments problems as usinspired because the 
resolution was a latin american initiative 
panama has said the united states systematically sought to 
subvert the election process there and has committed economic 
aggression against panama through sanctions 
president bush praised the oas resolution thursday and his 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said were gratified that the oas 
countries shared the united states position 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
noriega should listen to the clear message from his people and 
from his neighbors its time for him to leave 
appointed as oas mediators were the foreign ministers of 
ecuador guatemala and trinidad they will fly to panama on monday 
for consultations with panamanian authorities 
the mediators are assigned to report back to their fellow 
hemispheric foreign ministers after june 5

thus give them a muchimproved chance of ending a 50year drought 
in which no democrat has represented kansas in the senate 
when she first ran in 1978 she pledged to serve only 12 years 
two sixyear terms if she won a senate seat she was elected that 
year when seeking reelection in 1984 she repeated that vow and 
retained the seat 
she said she changed her mind and decided she could best serve 
kansas by using her seniority but added that it troubled her to 
break the pledge it did bother me because i believe a number of 
kansans valued the fact that when i say something thats what i 
mean kassebaum said 
however she argued that it would hurt kansas if she limited her 
tenure when others in congress are not subject to similiar 
restrictions there is no limit on the number of terms a person can 
serve in the senate or the house 
if youre the only one you simply give up some of the 
credentials and the seniority that you have built here that you 
hope can be useful to your state kassebaum said

colleges trustees approve the bid the group wants to find another 
school to take over the facilities 
loud applause broke out with the foundations successful bid as 
tearyeyed students stood in the grass outside the auction hall on 
campus and peered in the windows 
the kissing rock sits just inside the main gate of the 
carthage campus and folklore has it that any student who sits on 
it is fair game for a kiss 
were glad this day is passed said richard pickett 
president of robert morris college a twoyear business school that 
used to be based in this western illinois city but now has its main 
campus in chicago 
were disappointed it didnt bring a more reasonable figure 
pickett added but its time robert morris college gets on to 
other things i dont have to worry about carthage anymore 
terry newell a carthage car dealer and president of the 
education foundation said he was confident the robert morris 
trustees would approve the bid 
i feel it will be accepted and well have no problem raising 
400000 newell said were going to try and get somebody to 
come in and replace robert morris college we want to keep it 
whole viable and an educational institution if possible

turning the campus into a prison he said the same process was used 
in 1965 when the old carthage college closed his group bought the 
campus for 11 million at that time then sold it for the same 
price to robert morris college he said 
well look at any possibility but our top priority is to keep 
it a school newell said 
about 50 protesters outside said they were concerned the school 
would be auctioned off in smaller pieces if a buyer for the whole 
parcel could not be found 
we dont want the school sold in pieces said beulah shirey 
a carthage resident who joined the other protesters some carrying 
signs reading carthage divided we fall and carthage pride 
in december school officials stunned carthage residents with 
their decision to close the campus because of a deficit of 460000 
the school was one of largest employers in this city of 3000 
the college which will close this summer has about 370 students 
and 110 faculty and staff members about 1350 students attend the 
chicago campus 
city officials feared not only the loss of the schools 2 
million annual payroll but the other benefits to the local economy 
estimated at four times that amount

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes 
vow to keep mediumrange nuclear weapons in europe if the us 
modernizes its shortrange arms is an appalling threat 
unsupported by the negotiating record a former chief us arms 
control negotiator said thursday 
i believe that shevardnadzes statement was pretty 
appalling max kampelman chief strategic arms control negotiator 
in the reagan administration told the senate foreign relations 
committee 
i cannot believe they want to leave the message that they want 
to open up questions about their willingness to live up to their 
arms control commitments kampelman said 
shevardnadze speaking in bonn west germany last saturday said 
that if the united states did not drop plans to more than triple 
the range of its aging lance missiles in western europe the soviet 
union would respond either by developing a new shortrange weapon 
or by retaining ss23 missiles which have a range of 310 miles 
the 1987 intermediate nuclear forces or inf treaty bans all 
missiles with a range of between 300 and 3500 miles including the 
ss23 
kampelman noted that some have speculated that there might have 
been an implicit understanding at one level or another of the us 
and soviet negotiating teams that if the soviets agreed to 
dismantle the ss23 the united states would not give modernized 
shortrange missiles a range close to 300 miles 
kampelman said that when he heard of shevardnadzes statement 
i was certain that if there had been that kind of understanding 
i would have known 
he said he checked with other negotiators who were part of the 
hard bargaining that produced the inf treaty 
kampelman said they agreed with me that there was absolutely 
no reason for the soviets to believe there was anything that could 
be so interpreted 
he said that possibility did present itself at one time but the 
soviets did not agree to it 
the soviets were told ok but then we dont want you to 
complain if our modernization comes close to 300 miles 
kampelman said the ststement was not typical of the 
shevardnadze i have been dealing with for quite some time 
i have never before seen a threat and i was surprised 
kampelman said 
i have to believe this was part of the old thinking of the 
soviet union toward western europe which is to frighten them 
paul nitze who was president reagans chief arms control 
adviser said he cannot imagine that shevardnadze would have made 
his vow without some explanation 
there must be something some place that i havent been able 
to find nitze said 
but kampelman there mere be an outside chance soviet negotiators 
were told informally that something is possible 
that he has evidence that a commitment was actually made i 
would just doubt very much kampelman said 
all 19 members of the foreign relations committee signed on 
wednesday a letter to president bush asking him to seek a 
clarification from the soviet president about his foreign 
ministers statement 
sen nancy l kassebaum rkan who helped organize the letter 
writing effort called the foreign ministers statement very 
irresponsible because it could cause a lot of damage to the 
future of arms control and throw a lot of and in everybodys 
eyes 
sen joseph r biden rdel siad he believed shevardnadzes 
declaration was done out of whole cloth 
it flies in the face of what they have been doing and had that 
kind of impact after all their cooing and wooing he said

secretary of state james a baker iii held a 
hurriedup meeting thursday with west german defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg who carried new proposals designed to avoid an 
allied clash over shortrange nuclear weapons at the upcoming nato 
summit 
a diplomatic source familiar with stoltenbergs proposals 
confirmed that the west germans are prepared to be more flexible on 
the question of ussoviet negotiations over the weapons 
the united states has opposed such talks proposed last week by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev fearing that they could open 
the way to stripping western europe of its shortrange nuclear 
weapons and leaving it vulnerable to the superior conventional 
forces of the warsaw pact 
west germany wants such talks to begin and has proposed that 
nato delay modernizing its arsenal of shortrange lance missiles 
most of which are based in west germany 
the bonn governments opposition to the weapons stems from the 
fact they are designed for battlefield use meaning that in time of 
war they would most probably strike east and west germany 
the west germans are now expressing the hope that an agreement 
with the united states might be worked out within the next few 
days even though sharp differences remain eight days before 
president bush leaves for a critical nato meeting in paris 
at the end of thursdays talks west german sources said 
stoltenberg had described his meeting with baker as very useful 
and had said he was hopeful an agreement with the united states 
could be reached by early next week the source spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
although baker and stoltenberg had been scheduled to meet only 
on friday an early thursday session was arranged so that 
stoltenberg could confer with baker at the beginning of the defense 
ministers twoday visit which is aimed at settling the bitter 
dispute between bonn and washington 
stoltenberg also met for three hours with his counterpart 
defense secretary dick cheney 
state department spokesman richard boucher declined to comment 
on the substance of stoltenbergs talks with baker except to say 
that the two touched on the shortrange missile issue and on other 
topics boucher said they planned to continue their talks with a 
longer discussion on friday 
stoltenbergs mission was to suggest a possible link between a 
reduction of soviet bloc conventional forces in europe and the 
start of negotiations between east and west on cutting back the 
number of shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
such negotiations might not begin until there is significant 
progress in reducing european arsenals of conventional arms where 
the warsaw pact has a huge advantage 
one proposal would be to form a highlevel nato study group to 
examine how much significant progress would be necessary before 
any ussoviet talks could convene the diplomatic source said 
allowing such a study would give the nato summit partners more 
of a chance to resolve their differences 
baker has insisted the united states will stick to its position 
that talks should first produce a reduction in soviet bloc forces 
in europe to match nato levels only then would the united states 
be willing to consider discussing shortrange missiles 
stoltenbergs visit came amid predictions from a group of west 
german parliament members visiting washington that an agreement 
between bonn and washington will be ironed out prior to the nato 
summit 
theres a new flexibility on both sides the chances we will 
reach an agreement are not 100 percent but given the political 
will theres a good chance we will reach an agreement before the 
nato summit said volcker ruehe the deputy majority leader in 
parliament in a meeting with reporters

nursing home residents their advocates and 
state officials accused a government agency on thursday of trying 
to enforce nursing home reforms before it even spelled out how 
those institutions could comply with the new rules 
they said the health care finance administration put the cart 
before the horse by issuing rules for enforcement of a 1987 reform 
law without providing necessary guidelines for complying 
we simply have been astounded by hcfas delays in providing 
education information and guidance to the states on the important 
most timely provisions of the law susan rourke president of 
the national citizens coalition for nursing home reform told the 
senate special committee on aging 
it is a very difficult position for the states to be in 
required by law to implement a program without regulatory guidance 
and the probability that whatever we do may not be what the 
regulations ultimately require said dana petrowsky 
administrator of the division of health facilities in iowas 
department of inspections and appeals 
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 obligated the 
department of health and human services through hcfa to set 
standards for quality of care provide for protection of patients 
rights and ensure minimum training of nurses aides who provide 
most patient care in nursing homes 
the legislation provided that the reforms be phased in over 2 
years 
experts in caring for the elderly said state agencies and health 
care providers responsible for implementing the reforms have not 
received from hcfa regulations for two major aspects of the 
legislation nurses aide training and evaluation and client 
preadmission screening 
meanwhile hcfa issued final rules regarding nursing home survey 
and certification requirements including the inspection system to 
be used in february 
c ross anthony associate administrator for program development 
at hcfa said much of the work to establish the standards had been 
done before the reform law was passed so his agency decided to 
proceed with enforcement regulations 
we did not want to delay such important areas of reform as 
enhanced residents rights and strengthened quality of care he 
said 
g janet tulloch a resident of a washington dc nursing home 
said enactment of the law meant light at the end of a very dark 
tunnel of subtle abuse 
but the waivers of nursing aide training and onsite nurses 
requirements permitted under the rules hcfa propounded in february 
will allow the easiest solution wherever possible said the 
65yearold woman whose cerebal palsy has forced her to live in a 
nursing home for 21 years 
congress wrote unusually detailed deadlines into the law because 
of efforts by the reagan administration to reduce federal 
regulation of nursing homes despite widespread reports of abuse and 
corruption 
sen david pryor dark the committee chairman questioned 
whether the action by hcfa in issuing enforcement rules before it 
issued guidelines was a back door attempt by hcfa to deregulate 
nursing homes

police and soldiers broke up a battle 
by two groups for control of a local section of the petroleum 
workers union in this oil producing center and 78 people were 
injured officials said thursday 
one worker was in critical condition with a fractured skull and 
five more were hospitalized with broken bones said jose luis 
bermudez a spokesman for the state petroleum monopoly pemex 
bermudez said wednesdays brawl occurred at the unions section 
30 and he called it strictly a union dispute he said the incident 
did not affect pemex operations in the large oilfield in veracruz 
state on the gulf of mexico 
carlos carvajal lopez state judicial police regional commander 
told the government newspaper el nacional he had to call on a 
nearby army post to help local police restore order 
the dispute began march 7 when a dissident group led by roberto 
reyes betancourt claimed they won elections for control of section 
30 seized the building and barricaded themselves inside 
carvajal and bermudez said that wednesday morning an estimated 
200 workers loyal to ruben amador castro who is backed by the 
unions national executive council tried to storm the building 
the attackers were armed with rocks picks and shovels and a 
pitched battle followed the officials said 
no arrests were reported 
disputes in sections and locals have been frequent in the giant 
union since joaquin hernandez galicia nicknamed la quina and a 
group of 49 oldtime leaders were arrested by federal agents in 
january on charges of corruption and illegal possession of weapons 
five of the leaders were released for lack of evidence and the 
others are awaiting trial in mexico city

indian leaders in oklahoma told a senate 
investigating committee thursday their tribes are losing millions 
of dollars each year because farmers and others wont relinquish a 
stretch of valuable land the tribes own along the arkansas river 
it makes me ill every time i think of it to have 96 miles of 
riverbed that belongs to the tribes and we have no access said 
hollis roberts chief of the choctaw nation 
he said threeeighths of the acreage is choctaw oneeighth 
chickasaw and half cherokee 
more than 100 years ago the federal government signed treaties 
with the indians that gave them the land but in 1908 a year after 
oklahoma joined the union the interior department decided the land 
belonged to the state 
a supreme court decision in 1970 determined that the three 
tribes always had title to the land but by that time it was being 
used by farmers and others who believed they owned it 
now in order for the indians to get the land back they must go 
to court with land surveys showing which property is rightfully 
theirs said wilma mankiller chief of the cherokees 
she roberts and william anoatubby governor of the chickasaws 
told the special committee of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs that they have urged the bureau of indian affairs to 
expedite the surveys but have been unsuccessful 
the special committee has been investigating all the agencies 
that are supposed to be meeting the governments treaty obligations 
to the indians throughout the country 
mankiller said one of the problems in her tribes case has been 
a lack of money she said congress agreed in 1973 to provide 
440000 a year for a fiveyear program to estimate the value of 
the land and survey the land 
riverbed includes the channel in which a river formerly flowed 
only two years of the program were funded resulting in the 
survey of 700 acres with 22000 acres to be done 
sen don nickles rokla said congress could put some pressure 
on the bia to do the survey 
we can tell bia to do it out of available funds or we can 
give them some more money he said but he added that it would be 
wise to put a deadline on the agency so the work would get done as 
quickly as possible 
the tribal leaders estimated that they could be getting more 
than 1 million a year from the fertile riverbed land if it leased 
the property to farmers 
the sand and gravel along the river banks could bring in about 
20 million said william foster attorney for the cherokees and 
the oil and gas beneath the surface is good for another several 
million dollars a year he said 
chief roberts explained that the tribes own the land for about a 
mile on each side of the arkansas river but over the years 
property owners farther up the banks have farmed all the way down 
to the river because the land was vacant 
when they sell their farms they include the riverbed as part of 
the property he said 
many have leased out the property for oil and gas because they 
believe they own the property said tina jordanwalker attorney 
for the arkansas riverbed authority 
mankiller said that the tribes are interested in greater 
selfsufficiency and have no natural resource in the area other 
than the riverbed 
to us the arkansas riverbed represents almost 80 years in 
pursuit of rights in tribal lands at great cost in lost surface and 
subsurface leasing revenues sand and gravel resource destruction 
and litigation expenses said mankiller 
we will not rest until we are fairly compensated for these 
losses she said

the biggest cheers for slogans being chanted at 
massive prodemocracy demonstrations in beijing go to those calling 
for senior leader deng xiaoping to step down 
but all the sloganeers are striving for clever verses and catchy 
rhythms to make their point 
protesters parade endlessly by the great hall of the people 
hard by the huge tiananmen square rallying site 
one group stops to chant where has all the money gone gone 
to feed them gesturing toward the cavernous hall where deng and 
other leaders conduct much of their business 
widely popular when he began implementing rural economic reforms 
a decade ago the 84yearold deng 85 to the chinese who count 
children as one year old when born is now the target of 
disaffected students workers and intellectuals 
they hold him responsible for rampant government corruption and 
stymied political reform 
xiaoping get down from the stage runs the most common 
antideng slogan seen during the protests so far 
xiaoping your time has come read a banner held aloft at 
tiananmen square by workers from the no 2 beijing shoe factory 
one chant pokes fun at dengs wellknown fondness for bridge 
xiaoping xiaoping at 85 youre old 
youre ok at cards but your minds no good 
another takes a line from a song about mao tsetung and adds one 
about deng 
chairman mao is like the sun wherever he shines it is bright 
deng xiaoping is like the moon whose phases come and go 
bystanders cheered a truck bearing a cardboard sign that read 
first go after the son referring to dengs son pufang a major 
trading firm associated with the younger dengs association for the 
handicapped was reorganized because of corruption 
the children of the people are starving others sang out 
whats xiaopings son doing 
two qinghua university students carried a banner demonstrating 
the winds of change in 1984 the banner said xiaoping how are 
you but now a character had been added so it read xiaoping 
you are so cruel for not visiting students fasting on the 
square since saturday 
several signs recalled the memory of chou enlai a beloved 
statesman who died in 1972 
chou was a great premier for all the people said wang 
guangju of the chinese association of industrial associations as he 
waved a portrait of chou 
we used to love deng xiaoping but now there is corruption and 
official extravagance in every part of the country and we have no 
democracy

the senate foreign relations committee 
unanimously adopted two amendments thursday that would make it a 
felony for government employees to solicit or divert money for 
irancontratype activities 
the proposed legislation stems from the congressional 
investigation into allegations that proceeds of secret arms sales 
to iran during the reagan administration were diverted to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
the first provision would make it a felony for a federal 
employee to solicit money to support foreign policy activities for 
which congress had prohibited funding violators could be 
imprisoned for up to five years or fined or both 
the second provision would bar government officials from 
engaging in quid pro quo deals in which foreign assistance 
would be given to a country in exchange for that countrys carrying 
out an activity for which congress had barred funding 
the amendments to the state department authorization bill for 
fiscal 1990 were introduced by sen daniel p moynihan dny

former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will 
testify before parliament next week on his links to an 
influencepeddling scandal that brought down his successor the 
governing party said thursday 
the move by the liberal democratic party is a concession to the 
increasingly strident opposition which has boycotted parliamentary 
sessions to back demands that nakasone testify 
prosecutors on thursday searched the homes and offices of a key 
former aide to the former prime minister and another 
parliamentarian the two politicians are suspected of taking bribes 
to help recruit co an information and publishing conglomerate 
nakasone previously refused to testify before parliament on the 
issue but liberal democratic officials said he will go before the 
legislators next week probably on wednesday he has denied 
wrongdoing 
nakasone was prime minister in 1986 when 160 influential 
politicians bureaucrats and businessmen including several 
nakasone aides purchased recruit stock at a bargain price and 
then quickly sold it after it went on the market for a much higher 
price 
prime minister noboru takeshita announced on april 25 that he 
would resign to take responsibility for the recruit scandal polls 
had shown support for takeshita and his liberal democrats at 
alltime lows 
the opposition demand for nakasones testimony stiffened after 
the liberal democrats rammed the fiscal 1989 budget through the 
lower house in its absence the quick vote on april 28 defied the 
traditional japanese emphasis on consensus 
aside from the stock deals the opposition wants to question 
nakasone about help allegedly given to recruit by japans 
telecommunications giant nippon telegraph and telephone corp 
former ntt chairman hisashi shinto is among 14 businessmen and 
bureaucrats arrested so far in the recruit case 
the two politicians whose homes were searched thursday were 
also interrogated for two days by prosecutors they are the first 
elected officials against whom such formal legal action has been 
taken 
to arrest the two prosecutors would need permission from 
parliament since the legislature is now in session 
the two are takao fujinami an eightterm member of the house of 
representatives who was chief cabinet secretary under nakasone and 
katsuya ikeda of the opposition komeito clean government party 
fujinami 56 has acknowledged that an aide in 1986 bought 
12000 recruit shares at a discounted price before the companys 
stock was publicly traded after public trading began the stock 
was sold for a profit of 191000 
ikeda 51 a fourterm member of the house of representatives 
said his brother bought 5000 shares in the firm and gained 73530 
from the transaction 
in both cases the politicians denied personal involvement in 
the transactions although news reports said the bulk of the 
profits had gone into their bank accounts 
in all recruit sold bargain shares to about 160 influential 
politicians bureaucrats and businessmen 
ikeda said tuesday that he would resign his parliament seat 
governing party officials denied reports that fujinami also would 
resign but indicated he might have to step down if he is formally 
charged 
the liberal democrats still are trying to find a new prime 
minister who is untainted by the scandal

federal examiners discovered new evidence of 
fraud in nearly one in four of the 219 savings institutions taken 
over by the government so far this year regulators told the bush 
administration thursday 
the federal deposit insurance corp in a report to the treasury 
department said that since beginning the takeover of the nations 
most deeply insolvent sampls on feb 7 its examiners have uncovered 
potential criminal violations in about 50 institutions and referred 
the cases to the justice department 
thats in addition to possible fraud already uncovered by the 
federal home loan bank board which previously had responsibility 
for the institutions 
james dudine director of the fdics antifraud effort said 
there are indications of crime at as many as half of the 219 
institutions put under government control in preparation for the 
enactment of president bushs sampl bailout plan 
dudine said that many of the justice department referrals 
involved additional evidence in previously known cases rather than 
entirely new cases more than half of the new evidence was 
uncovered in texas sampls he said 
in a typical fraud case an sampl official has an undisclosed 
interest in a a commercial real estate project that received a loan 
from the institution and couldnt repay it dudine said 
under bushs sampl reform proposals the fdic which insures 
deposits at commercial banks would also get that responsibility 
for sampls while congress debates the proposal the fdic under 
bushs orders is taking over the worst sampls cataloging their 
losses looking for fraud and preparing them for sale to private 
investors 
fdic chairman l william seidman told reporters that accumulated 
losses at the sampls under supervision by april 15 totaled 298 
billion representing 40 percent of the institutions combined 
assets of 734 billion 
the agency plans to take control of about 60 more institutions 
by july bringing the total assets to 1155 billion 
the nearly 30 billion in losses is in line with the estimates 
of the bush administration which hopes to spend 50 billion to 
close all institutions now insolvent or that slip into insolvency 
in the next three years roughly 500 
seidman said the 50 billion should be enough because the failed 
institutions not yet under government control are in better shape 
from what we know now this is enough money if things get 
worse it clearly wont be enough money he said 
seidman defended his agency against charges it is allowing 
institutions under its control to pay high interest rates thus 
hurting solvent sampls trying to compete for deposits 
why dont we order them to pay less of course we can do that 
but if we did they wouldnt get the deposits they need to fund 
themselves seidman said 
the fdic estimated that the thrifts under its control have lost 
34 billion in deposits but seidman said he expected the outflow 
to taper off if interest rates remain stable or decline as some 
economists predict 
on another matter the fdic acknowledged that its had to cut 
back on supervision of commercial banks and after assigning 1029 
employees to the failed sampls seidman said bank examinations since 
the start of february are down 22 percent from the same period a 
year ago nevertheless he said the agency expects to complete 
about 4100 bank examinations this year up from 4019 from in 1988

israeli foreign minister moshe arens said 
thursday that he has obtained a very large measure of support 
from us officials for his governments controversial proposal to 
hold elections among palestinians in the israelioccupied 
territories 
there is a very large degree of understanding and a very large 
measure of agreement on the issues we discussed arens said after 
a 45minute meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii 
i think we have a commmitment of the administration here to 
support the entire initiative arens said 
but a us official said that while the israeli plan had 
promising possibilities much work needs to be done the 
official speaking on condition he not be named said the united 
states had been looking at what opportunities it affords and what 
questions remain to be answered 
baker told arens the next step would be for israel to start 
talks with palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip on details 
for the elections and what conditions would be acceptable to each 
side said the us official they need to talk directly to each 
other on that he said 
arens told reporters he had not discussed details of the plan 
which was adopted this week by the israeli government and 
parliament either with baker or with national security adviser 
brent scowcroft 
i dont think we should get sidetracked at the present time in 
talking about this or that detail he said 
israeli sources say the united states is pressing israel to give 
answers to several points raised by baker in a letter to israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir last week regarding details of the 
election blueprint 
specifically the united states wants israel to say whether it 
will agree to international supervision of the elections among the 
17 million palestinians of the west bank and gaza strip and 
whether the palestinians living in israeliannexed east jerusalem 
would be allowed to vote 
according to the sources who spoke only on condition they not 
be named the united states asked shamir for the answers by the end 
of june 
arens denied baker had pressed him for details it wasnt 
pushed at all he said 
arens said he had urged the bush administration to grant 
wholehearted and unreserved american support for this peace 
initiative such support he said has a good chance of 
enlisting support among other countries throughout the world and 
eliciting a positive reaction from the arab world and that is a 
necessary precondition for this thing to really take off 
israel also would like the us endorsement in order to deflect 
criticism from hardliners at home who say the plan will ultimately 
lead to creation of a palestinian state anathema to most israelis 
the plan envisions elections of palestinians who would negotiate 
with israel for limited selfrule in the west bank and gaza strip 
following several years of selfrule israel would then engage in 
talks on the future of the lands which it captured from egypt and 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the plan excludes any participation by representatives of the 
palestine liberation organization and egyptian leader hosni 
mubarak and jordans king hussein have said they would not accept 
it unless the plo approves 
state department envoy dennis ross shuttled among israel jordan 
and egypt earlier this week and reported on his talks thursday to 
baker and arens 
as arens and baker discussed the situation in the territories 
especially the palestinian uprising of the past 17 months in which 
more than 480 palestinians have been killed some 30 protesters 
marched outside the state department building shouting long live 
plo 
in a move to end the demonstration before arens emerged 
security officials drove away the cars of the official motorcade as 
though to indicate arens would be spirited away through another 
entrance but soon after the protesters dispersed the cars came 
back and arens came out and spoke to reporters 
at a meeting with defense secretary dick cheney earlier arens 
described a recent escalation of palestinian attacks against 
israelis and against arabs perceived as collaborators with israeli 
authorities the sources said arens told cheney that by 
maintaining its official contacts with the plo begun last year the 
united states was encouraging the palestinians to continue their 
attacks

a senate appropriations subcommittee freed up 
enough new money thursday to prevent the federal communications 
commission from having to close its doors for two days this year 
but the panel made no promises to fund a 10 percent increase for 
the commission in 1990 
the appropriations subcommittee on the departments of commerce 
justice and state the judiciary and related agencies said the fcc 
could have about 400000 the government received from florida as 
compensation for moving an fcc monitoring station in fort 
lauderdale to make way for a new highway 
fcc chairman dennis patrick in a second day of congressional 
testimony on the agencys 1990 appropriation request told the 
panel the commission needs 495000 or it will have to furlough all 
its employees for two days 
congress gave the fcc 996 million in this fiscal year that 
ends sept 30 the same amount the commission received in 1988 the 
agency went over budget this year patrick said because of 
federally mandated increases in salaries and benefits 
patrick had told a house appropriations subcommittee on march 7 
that the shortfall would be 890000 or 3 furlough days but 
thursday he said more employees than expected had taken advantage 
of early retirement programs leave without pay or shortened their 
work schedules 
fcc spokeswoman maureen peratino said the agency could avoid the 
furloughs if it received 400000 
through attrition and other cutbacks it looks like were 
going to come out fine by the end of the year she said following 
the hearing 
patrick estimated the agency would have 1620 fulltime 
permanent employees by oct 1 the beginning of fiscal 1990 that 
would be 20 percent below staffing levels in the early 1980s he 
said 
therefore patrick said the agencys backlog in processing 
license applications has grown 
he said the fcc needs the full 1098 million requested by the 
white house a 10 percent increase to pay for 1889 fulltime 
employees new computer and monitoring equipment increased 
salaries and benefits and travel expenses to keep up with explosive 
growth in the telecommunications industry 
we simply have not had the funds necessary to maintain our 
speed of service in processing applications patrick said 
a subcommittee aide warren kane said the panel was sympathetic 
to patricks budget request 
we dont find a whole lot to dispute them on that kane said 
in an interview following the hearing the problem is how far 
can we go on the current budget resolution 
the house on wednesday passed a 117 trillion federal budget 
resolution that reflects a 28 billion deficitreduction deal the 
bush administration and congressional leaders reached last month 
the senate worked on the measure thursday 
subcommittee chairman ernest f hollings dsc told patrick 
that job attrition could be expected at the fcc since the agency 
has eased or abandoned some regulatory oversight 
peratino of the fcc said that even though subcommittee members 
made no promises regarding 1990 funds i think well do better 
than we did this year 
patrick also made a pitch for a proposal to auction off new 
licenses to the highest bidder a system he said would reap 338 
billion for the us treasury

moderates made a strong showing 
on both banks of the protestantcatholic divide in northern 
irelands local elections tv projections and partial returns 
showed thursday 
with half the 566 seats on 26 district councils declared gains 
were forecast on the roman catholic side for the democratic and 
labor party and a patchy result for sinn fein the legal political 
wing of the outlawed irish republican army 
among the protestants who outnumber catholics 32 heavy losses 
were projected for rev ian paisleys hardline democratic unionist 
party 
four candidates who won in affluent protestant north down ran 
as conservatives in an effort to lure prime minister margaret 
thatchers party into the fray 
the hopes of sinn fein which backs the ira war against british 
rule in the province hung on the vote from its belfast stronghold 
to be counted friday 
ulster tv forecast a 5 percent drop for paisleys party to 194 
percent and a 27percent gain for its more moderate rival the 
official unionists to 326 percent 
it projected a 16 percent gain for sdlp moderates to 194 
percent and a 3 percent fall for sinn fein to 88 percent 
a bbctv projection gave the sdlp 206 percent and sinn fein 
111 percent 
everywhere we stood our vote has gone up very well said 
sdlp leader john hume 
but the slow handcount and the complex proportional 
representation system meant surprises could still come before the 
twoday tally is complete 
the sdlp looked set for its best local election performance but 
was in no mood to write off sinn fein 
there seems to be a fairly uniform pattern of marginal decline 
in the sinn fein vote in the rural areas it may not be reflected 
in belfast said the sdlps alban maginnis 
danny mcguinness of the alliance the provinces only mixed 
catholicprotestant party said the election appeared to reflect 
a shift toward the center parties away from the dup and sinn 
fein 
i think that for long time people wanted to see some movement 
in politics in northern ireland he said 
sinn fein president gerry adams blamed his partys showing on a 
government ban on broadcast interviews with sinn fein members but 
he admitted that a series of bungled ira attacks that killed 
innocent bystanders may also have alienated voters 
the censorship factor our own organization and perhaps 
the ira factor have all contributed perhaps in preventing sinn 
fein from advancing its vote he said 
but our aim was to consolidate our vote and we appear to be 
doing that he said 
sinn feins vote looked solid in its urban strongholds but down 
in many rural areas 
in enniskillen where a ira bomb killed 11 protestants in 1987 
sinn fein local leader paul corrigans vote fell from 2360 to 
1781 a setback in a sparsely populated rural district 
paisley said his partys losses reflected a protestant community 
split between those west of the bann river who are more exposed to 
ira attack than those in urban areas east of the bann 
many of our urban voters did not come out and stand with our 
harassed brothers and sisters on the other side of the bann he 
said 
but his official unionist opponents said the reason was a 
militant paisleyled campaign against the 1985 angloirish 
agreement 
that accord signed by britain and ireland gave dublin a say in 
the running of the province and provoked overwhelming outrage from 
the protestant majority which regards ireland as a hostile 
catholicdominated state 
but where the official unionists opted for lawful peaceful 
protest the democratic unionists tried boycotts and civil 
disobedience 
official unionist john taylor said the election showed his 
partys opposition directed within the law has won widespread 
consent 
we have now advanced beyond 30 percent of public support which 
is a great barrier to break through and it looks as though we 
will also get more than 200 seats for the first time which is 
excellent news he said 
but the democratic unionists sammy wilson said his party lost 
support for not resisting the angloirish agreement vigorously 
enough 
people who are impatient with the campaign against the 
agreement on the whole feel we should have been rid of the 
agreement that much quicker he said 
the belfast conservatives say it is the failure of mainland 
british parties to campaign in northern ireland that leaves the 
field open to local politicians to run politics on sectarian lines

a ship that is to carry a team of 
explorers to antarctica set sail for new york on thursday on the 
first part of its voyage organizers said 
the ceremonial departure of the hightech polar ship uap took 
place on sunday but after some tests at sea the crew returned 
quietly to port when some minor parts and repairs were needed 
skipper jean collet said 
the silver ship left this normandy port about 8 pm under clear 
skies the organizers said 
after the new york stop the uap will head for king george 
island from where the adventurers will launch the first 
unmechanized trek across the vast frozen continent 
the operation is being organized by will steger of ely minn 
who in 1986 led the first unsupported dogsled trek to the north 
pole since adm robert peary and frenchman jeanlouis etienne the 
first man to ski alone to the north pole 
the team is to leave king george island on aug 1 and spend 
seven months crossing about 4000 miles of ice and snow with their 
dogs arriving at the soviet mirnyy base in march 
organizers are hoping to draw attention to threats against the 
antarctic environment and the need for increased international 
cooperation to protect it 
the polar ship built for 317 million is 117 feet long and 32 
feet wide it was christened in a ceremony saturday 
other members of the team include victor boyarsky of the soviet 
arctic and antarctic research institute glaciologist qin dahe of 
china geoff somers of britain and keizo funatsu of japan 
most of the explorers will join the ship later in the 
expedition rather than participating in the atlantic crossing

a meeting of the communist party 
central committee ended thursday in disagreement over what to do 
about kosovo a province bordering albania that has been torn by 
ethnic conflict 
no vote was taken on a prepared resolution because too few of 
the 165 members remained after 16 hours of quarrelsome debate 
voting requires a quorum of at least 110 members but only 101 were 
present 
the argument was between those generally serbs who support 
tough measures against the ethnic albanian majority in kosovo and 
liberals who prefer more democratic methods 
kosovo the ancient heartland of serbia is an autonomous 
province within the serbian republic ethnic albanians now make up 
85 percent of the population and the remaining serbs claim 
discrimination 
last spring the national government imposed a state of 
emergency and curfew in the province after more than 60000 ethnic 
albanians rioted in protest of constitutional amendments that gave 
serbia more control at least 25 people were killed including two 
policemen 
intellectuals dissidents and the liberal opposition have 
criticized the state of emergency the jailing of more than 800 
ethnic albanians and detention of at least 200 people without 
charge 
enver sehovic a central committee member from croatia the 
secondlargest republic after serbia denounced isolating people 
at an unknown location for an indefinite term and without 
possibility of legal protection 
he said such repressive measures and purges of ethnic albanian 
intellectuals businessmen workers and young people in kosovo 
caused revulsion in the west 
sehovic compared the action of the yugoslav army and police in 
kosovo to the brotherly assistance of soviet soldiers who 
invaded czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush liberal reforms 
dobrivoje vidic of serbia said sehovics statements were 
inadmissible and that the yugoslav army represents the 
instrument of the people in the struggle for freedom and 
independence 
at 1 am the central committee adjourned with members angrily 
accusing each other of ignorance about events in kosovo and 
elsewhere 
the official news agency tanjug said in a commentary the fact 
that 40 percent of the delegates were absent at the end speaks 
clearly about their choice between going home and reaching an 
agreement on the kosovo issue

europe faces a crack epidemic that could be as bad 
as any plague of the middle ages home secretary douglas hurd told 
a 19nation conference on narcotics thursday 
this is a plague we are visiting on ourselves said the 
minister whose department is responsible for police prisons and 
immigration 
crack is the specter i see hanging over europe if crack ever 
becomes deeply rooted in europe the outlook will indeed be bleak 
hurd addressed the opening session of a twoday meeting of 
western european governments in the council of europe 
ministers met to discuss increased cooperation in fighting 
narcotics and were told by hurd they must work together 
urgently to make sure the experience of drug abuse in the united 
states is not repeated in europe 
crack is a cheap smokable form of cocaine that gives an 
instant intense high as the drug goes straight to the brain 
but the effect wears off after a few minutes and a lingering 
deep depression follows 
hurd noted that crack was unheard of in the united states before 
1985 but is now a major drug there 
he said 75 percent of the people who used crack three times 
became addicted to it 
because the use of crack is accompanied by feelings of 
omnipotence and paranoia the behavior which results has devastated 
family life in the united states figures of child abuse have 
soared and so have attacks on the police the secretary said 
hurd pleaded for international cooperation to ensure traffickers 
or their profits have no hiding place 
the north american market having been saturated the cocaine 
barons of latin america are now driving their product into 
europe he said 
the traffickers are in it for the money if they stand a good 
chance of losing the money wherever it is stashed the incentive 
disappears 
hurd said britain was giving 810000 to the united nations for 
antinarcotics operations and an additional 32 million for 
equipment and training of law enforcement agencies in countries 
along the cocaine supply route from latin america to europe 
hurd said figures supplied by the parisbased international 
police organization interpol showed that cocaine seized in europe 
increased from 341 pounds in 1978 to nearly 5 tons last year 
he said two laboratories were dismantled in italy and about 590 
pounds of coca base and cocaine hydrochloride seized there 
this event indicates without doubt that largescale conversion 
of coca base into cocaine is under way in europe there is 
evidence too of cooperation between criminal organizations in 
colombia and italy hurd said 
he invited other countries to follow britains example in 
signing bilateral agreements to confiscate money from trafficking 
there are such agreements with the united states canada bahamas 
australia and switzerland and negotiations or approaching signings 
with spain sweden italy france and the netherlands 
barry sheerman the home affairs spokesman of britains 
opposition labor party criticized hurd for ignoring police pleas 
to provide cash to reward drugring informers 
the only way to beat these gangs is to get high levels of 
inside information sheerman said

the plo expelled four west german relief 
workers from their base in a refugee camp thursday because it said 
they concealed the identity of those who kidnapped members of their 
group this month 
the palestine liberation organization also said the workers from 
the asmehumanitas group at the mieh mieh camp had ignored security 
regulations it did not elaborate 
we gave them 60 minutes to pack and leave said abu ali 
wajih in charge of security for all the palestinian refugee camps 
in lebanon we dont want to have anything to do with them 
anymore 
the four west germans were taken in a plo car to sidon where 
they were met by members of the nasserite militia and taken to 
another base the group keeps in aaqbiyeh controlled by the shiite 
amal militia it was not immediately known how long they would stay 
in lebanon 
the west german captives heinrich struebig 48 an 
administrator and thomas kemptner 28 a male nurse were 
kidnapped along with nurse petra schnitzler on tuesday 
ms schnitzler was freed a few hours later when a local militia 
stopped the kidnappers car thinking it was a gang of thieves 
both struebig and ms schnitzler had been kidnapped along with 
markus quint also a west german may 4 she and struebig were 
released the next day to transmit demands by the kidnappers seeking 
a lenient sentence for convicted terrorist mohammed ali hamadi a 
lebanese shiite moslem 
on wednesday a frankfurt court sentenced hamadi to life in 
prison for air piracy and murder in connection with the 1985 twa 
hijacking during which a us navy diver was killed 
asmehumanitas has seven workers serving mainly the palestinian 
camps 
quint was freed on sunday nabih berri whose shiite moslem 
militia controls most of southern lebanon beyond sidon took credit 
for the release and pledged to provide greater protection 
ms schnitzler said thursday that asmehumanitas headquarters 
had not asked the relief workers to leave 
but west german foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog said 
the west german government had asked the group 15 times in writing 
to pull out

fighting broke out thursday between 
loyal and mutinous troops in eritrea a western diplomat said and 
rebels in the province lent support to those trying to overthrow 
president mengistu haile mariam 
the diplomat said the 2nd armys commanding general a leader of 
the military revolt that began tuesday had been killed in the 
factional fighting 
the 2nd army had been considered in full opposition to mengistu 
and the fighting with loyalists inside the 2nd army represented 
what the diplomat based in addis ababa called a dramatic turn 
mengistu said in a broadcast thursday night that a few of the 
conspiracys collaborators attempted to continue the betrayal 
but the 2nd army has today crushed the traitors and has 
brought the situation under full control 
in his first public comment since since returning wednesday from 
an abbreviated trip to east germany mengistu said his 
revolutionary forces will liquidate the mutineers 
he blamed the uprising on a few generals who placed their 
greed and hunger for power above the natonal interest the 
revolt is the most serious challenge to mengistus 15yearold rule 
in ethiopia the soviet unions closest ally in africa 
the diplomat said loyal soldiers at least temporarily recaptured 
the radio station in asmara capital of the northern province and 
broadcast a statement declaring loyalty to the marxist government 
the radio station then went dead he said which suggested 
continued fighting between loyalists and mutineers in ethiopias 
second largest city the diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity 
a few hours before the report of fighting within the 2nd army 
the eritrean peoples liberation front declared it was suspending 
its 28yearold war of secession to support the mutineers 
the diplomat said the factional fighting may be a backlash 
against the rapprochement with the eplf 
voice of the masses of eritrea the rebel radio announced a 
unilateral twoweek ceasefire to facilitate the successful 
outcome of the military revolt the clandestine station reported 
earlier that rebel leaders had met with 2nd army commanders and 
discussed the best way to intensify the struggle 
mutineers have not stated an ideology or political goals beyond 
ousting mengistu the government and eritrean rebels both espouse 
marxism 
on thursday night the radio reported fighting among ethiopian 
army units in and around asmara and reiterated rebel readiness 
to give any kind of support and cooperation to the mutineers 
it offered the entire area under the control of the eplf as a 
fallback zone for the mutinous troops the radio also reported 
renewed fighting in addis ababa but the diplomat said there had 
been no shooting in addis ababa 
any alliance between the eritrean rebels and a fully rebellious 
2nd army would remove all government control from ethiopias 
northernmost province its only avenue to the red sea and 
presumably force mengistu to negotiate 
the rebels control threefourths of the countryside in eritrea 
and the army generally is confined to garrisons in the cities 
including asmara 
the diplomat said the counterrevolt within the 2nd army which 
numbers about 150000 men was led by a tank brigade and a 
paratrooper unit he identified the slain commander as denissie 
bulto a key ringleader in the plot against mengistu 
state radio said thursday that industry ministry fanta belai had 
been arrested as one of the plotters he formerly commanded the air 
force 
mengistus defense minister maj gen haile giorgis habte 
mariam and at least two rebellious generals have been killed 
unconfirmed reports said a fourth coup leader maj gen 
kumalafchew dejene the deputy commander of armed forces in 
eritrea was hunted down wednesday and killed by loyalist soldiers 
government troops have been completely forced out of neighboring 
tigre province by rebels of the tigre peoples liberation front 
who want more autonomy in their area 
although their aims are different the rebel groups occasionally 
combine forces and in the past year dealt the government several 
humiliating defeats tigrean rebels also have voiced support for 
the dissident soldiers 
the londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
puts the strength of the ethiopian army at 315000 that of 
eritrean rebels at 30000 men and tigrean rebels at 20000 all the 
forces have tanks and artillery 
in addition air force units assigned to the north had about 
half the governments estimated 140 mig fighter jets and bombers 
it is not known which side the air force units took but the 
dissident soldiers were reported in control of asmaras airport 
and the government has warned civilian pilots not to fly over the 
city 
mengistu inherited the 28yearold northern civil war when he 
and a clique of army officers deposed emperor haile selassie on 
sept 12 1974 
eritrea is a former italian colony that was federated with 
ethiopia in 1957 under a ussponsored un resolution haile 
selassie annexed the territory in 1962

foreigners with aids will be allowed to seek 
30day visas to enter this country on business attend conferences 
or visit relatives the justice department said thursday 
new regulations to be issued by the immigration and 
naturalization service allowing such travel were drafted following 
last months dispute over the detention of a dutch aids patient en 
route to a conference in san francisco on the deadly disease said 
department spokesman david runkel 
runkel said aids patients will not be granted tourist visas but 
would be allowed apply to enter the country for 30day periods to 
attend conferences obtain medical treatment visit relatives or 
conduct business 
the regulations were drafted by ins after a federal immigration 
judge ruled last month that the agency should allow a dutch aids 
patient to attend the conference in san francisco 
hans paul verhoef 31 of rotterdam was detained in minneapolis 
after us customs service inspectors at local airport found the 
drug azt in his luggage verhoef then admitted to ins agents that 
he had aids 
the justice department did not appeal the immigration judges 
ruling that the ins should have granted verhoef a waiver of 
exclusion to attend the conference because he posed only a minimal 
risk of spreading the disease 
for years ins has asked foreigners seeking to enter this 
country to state whether they have a contagious or dangerous 
disease affliction with a variety of contagious diseases may be a 
ground for refusing to admit an alien either as a tourist or as a 
permanent resident 
congress specifically empowered ins in 1987 to exclude aliens 
who have aids which was added to the list of diseases 
traditionally considered by ins as a basis for exclusion 
the new regulations are being issued in advance of the 5th 
international conference on aids scheduled for june 49 in montreal 
organizers of the 1990 conference scheduled to be held in san 
francisco have asked attorney general dick thornburgh to consider 
easing restrictions to allow aids patients to attend the meetings 
gay organizations also expressed concern about people traveling 
through the united states en route to the montreal conference said 
urvashi vaid a spokeswoman for the national gay and lesbian task 
force 
the new rules were called a ludicrous policy by pat 
christen policy director for the san francisco aids foundation 
which has sought to delete aids and the hiv virus that causes the 
disease from the list of contagions for which aliens can be 
excluded 
there is no reason to believe that a tourist poses any more 
public health threat than a business person she said people 
with hiv infection are not casually contagious and are not going to 
go around transmitting the disease she said 
its a disease of consenting adults we dont need to worry 
about foreign invaders with this infection she added

defense minister yitzhak rabin on 
thursday ruled out goodwill gestures to improve conditions in the 
occupied territories and encourage palestinians to accept israels 
peace plan 
speaking on the eve of a 10day visit to the united states 
rabin said israel was not now ready to release prisoners reopen 
universities and public schools or take other measures to improve 
the climate amid the 17month uprising by palestinians in the 
occupied lands 
the present situation leaves no room for gestures rabin 
said in an interview with the associated press 
rabin pecifically ruled out releasing large numbers of the 6300 
palestinian security prisoners or reopening 11 palestinian 
universities and colleges in the west bank with a total enrollment 
of 17000 they have been closed since february 1988 
he said two attempts were made to restart classes at 1194 grade 
schools and high schools in the west bank but he said violent 
clashes immediately began between students and soldiers 
once the schools were closed there was a sharp reduction in 
the number of youngsters who were injured or worse he said 
rabin suggested israel might be willing to show flexibility on 
the participation of 140000 east jerusalem arabs international 
supervision and other unresolved questions about elections if 
palestinians first indicated agreement in principle to israels 
proposal 
if there will be acceptance in principle of the plan by 
palestinians in the territories we can go on and tackle other 
problems which are related to the matter of elections he said 
israels plan calls for elections to chose palestinian 
representatives to negotiate a selfrule scheme for the 15 million 
residents of the west bank and gaza strip negotiations on a 
permanent solution would start only after three years 
the plo executive committee rejected the israeli plan adopted 
by the cabinet on sunday as a farce most prominent 
palestinians in the occupied territories were also critical saying 
the plan failed to deal with palestinian aspirations for an 
independent state 
prime minister yitzhak shamir in an interview on israel 
television made clear he sees the plan as a way to prevent the 
establishment of a palestinian state 
asked if he believed the plan would lead to such a state shamir 
replied if i thought so i would not have proposed the plan i 
feel that the plan is our best weapon for fighting this 
shamir told his rightwing likud bloc wednesday that israel 
would not give an inch of land to the arabs as part of a 
permament solution 
foreign minister moshe arens said thursday after meeting 
secretary of state james baker in washington that the bush 
administration supported the israeli election plan but us 
officials said many questions remained such as who would be 
allowed to participate 
rabin met with two groups of palestinians from the occupied 
lands this week to explain the governments peace proposals he 
conceded their views reflected the negative comments made publicly 
by other palestinians but he said there was more of a sense of 
urgency about finding a solution among local palestinians 
they would like to see the light at the end of the tunnel 
while the plo people who reside in the villas of tunisia can wait 
10 to 15 years the urgency here is greater than outside at the 
same time no doubt they would not dare to go it alone he said 
he said israel would be willing to wait three to six months for 
a definitive palestinian answer before giving up on the initiative 
in the meantime he said israel counted on the united states to 
help persuade international and arab opinion of the plans worth 
palestinians would not be barred from running in the elections 
because they wanted an independent palestinian state or supported 
the plo rabin said adding the only criteria would be the advocacy 
of violence 
anyone who calls for violence against israel cannot be a 
candidate for elections he said 
but rabin said israels two major parties likud and labor were 
irrevocably split on whether israel should trade land for peace 
there is no government position on what should be on the 
boundaries or the form of the permanent peace he said 
he argued that because of the division the only course open was 
a twostep process that postponed talks on a permanent solution 
we hope the new realities we offer for a transition period of 
selfrule will create a new atmosphere and more confidence that 
can bring one of the two israeli sides to change its position 
said rabin 
in talks on a permament settlement palestinian and jordanian 
negotiators could propose any solution they desire including 
demands for palestinian statehood 
rabin called on palestinians to adopt a realistic position 
saying past peace efforts failed because of maximalist demands 
in the past and unfortunately in certain circles even today 
the arabs try a policy of everything or nothing and they have 
remained in the past 40 years with nothing 
they should start to become reasonable and learn that complex 
issues cannot be solved by miracles and open sesame solutions 
he said

a cook county grand jury refused to indict a man 
who disconnected his braindamaged comatose son from life support 
and held hospital workers at gunpoint until the boy died 
authorities said thursday 
rudy linares 23 a house painter from cicero was charged by 
the states attorneys office with murder in the april 26 death of 
his 15monthold son samuel 
but after the grand jury action the states attorneys office 
announced thursday it would not prosecute the charge 
im glad its more or less behind me now linares said i 
want to thank everybody that sent me cards letters their prayers 
moral support 
he said he and his wife just want to go home and spend some 
time together 
linares pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unlawful use 
of a weapon and was sentenced by circuit judge robert bastone to 
one year conditional discharge meaning he will serve no time in 
jail said dan mccullough spokesman for states attorney cecil 
partee 
as far as punishment is concerned bastone said thursday 
i think you have suffered enough 
the case of rudy linares has been a unique frustrating and 
troubling one partee said his actions in removing his son 
from a respirator while armed with a loaded revolver were 
simultaneously inappropriate under the law yet understandable from 
the standpoint of a parent 
a conditional discharge means linares can go free provided he is 
given a psychological evaluation and that he get counseling if 
authorities recommend it 
after the hearing partee reiterated his plan to form a task 
force of medical legal and religious representatives to analyze 
the issues presented by the case and seek appropriate legislation 
linares son had been in an irreversible coma since august when 
he accidentally swallowed a balloon 
sammy linares died nine months ago and whatever 
occurred between then and three weeks ago could not change that 
said kevin smith trial supervisor for the public defenders office 
and one of linares three attorneys 
authorities said linares pulled his son from a lifesupport 
system at rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center and holding 
a 357caliber gun cradled the boy in his arms until the baby died 
i did it because i loved my son linares told reporters 
after arrest 
the hospital last year refused to comply with a request from the 
linares family for a withdrawal of life support from their son 
hospital lawyer max brown said the youngster wasnt brain dead and 
such a move could have left doctors open to criminal charges 
authorities say linares also had unhooked his sons lifesupport 
system during a december visit but that staff members immediately 
reattached the boys ventilator and did not notify police 
the grand jury began its investigation three weeks ago 
medical examiner robert j stein testified before the grand jury 
wednesday and said afterward that he still had not determined if 
the babys death was accidental or a homicide 
stein has said the baby died from lack of oxygen to the brain 
because of the balloon and the termination of lifesupport

the senate finance committee has asked for an 
investigation into illegal imports of drug paraphernalia from 
nations on the rim of the pacific sen daniel p moynihan dny 
said thursday 
he said the committee sent a letter to anne brunsdale 
chairwoman of the us international trade commission asking for 
an investigation of the scope of illicit drug paraphernalia imports 
and the effectiveness of the mail order drug control act in 
restricting such products 
the proliferation of crack cocaine has spawned a new epidemic 
in illegal paraphernalia imports moynihan said crack vials 
plastic bags and pipes are providing illegal profits often greater 
than the drugs themselves 
he called for acting against the source countries which include 
taiwan singapore hong kong thailand japan and south korea 
between april 15 1988 and march 7 1989 the customs service 
seized at least 8 million worth of vials pipes spoons straws

cia director william webster said thursday 
that argentina is helping algerias nuclear development program and 
has entered discussions on similar arrangements with egypt iran 
and saudi arabia 
argentina is emerging as an emerging nuclear supplier to the 
developing third world as more and more countries seek to develop 
nuclear weapons capability webster said 
he noted that none of argentinas nuclear facilities are under 
international safeguards to prevent proliferation 
webster cited argentina as an example of the development of 
nuclear capability outside the small group of nations that have 
traditionally possessed it 
in a hearing held on the 15th anniversary of the explosion of a 
nuclear device by india the cia chief said evidence shows that 
india is now interested in thermonuclear weapons capability 
which would permit it to develop a hydrogen bomb 
webster said the nuclear rivalry between india and neighboring 
pakistan has all the earmarks of a race 
yet no real efforts have been made in the international 
community to head off that race he said 
another witness before the senate governmental affairs 
committee reginald bartholomew under secretary of state for 
science and technology said the indianpakistani rivalry makes 
south asia of the greatest concern from a nuclear proliferation 
standpoint 
the immediate problem is to persuade both india and pakistan 
to observe restraint in their nuclear activities so that technical 
developments do not overtake the chances for diplomatic progress 
he said 
webster said that 15 or more nations many from the developing 
world could possess nuclear weapons by the early years of the next 
century 
he also said many developing countries also are developing 
ballistic missiles which could be used to carry nuclear or other 
weapons to their targets 
by the year 2000 at least 15 developing countries will be 
producing their own ballistic missiles he said 
we believe the missile proliferation problem will affect every 
region of the world webster said it will become worse and 
may never become better 
we cannot now tell you when or where these weapons may be 
used webster said the odds on use are growing as more 
countries develop the technologies to settle old scores by new 
means 
webster said the cia aiming to obtain as much information as 
possible about the growing number of countries edging toward 
nuclear weapons capability is focusing on those countries that 
refuse to place nuclear facilities under safeguards or to sign the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
the soviet union a traditional supplier of shortrange 
ballistic missiles in the third world is now showing some interest 
in at least discussing the possibility of reining in missile 
proliferation the cia chief said

nazi experiments on concentration camp 
prisoners were so unethical that scientists should ignore the 
results a professor from west germany argued thursday at an 
international conference 
one should not touch the scientific data from these people 
dr benno mullerhill of the university of colognes institute of 
genetics told the conference on the meaning of the holocaust for 
bioethics 
the notion of taboo is very very important to set up a taboo 
is not a scientific decision this is a value decision i would 
strongly advise setting up a taboo not to use any of this data 
mullerhill said 
while scientists should be asked their opinions on what should 
be made taboo in research mullerhill said ultimately the decision 
should be made by the public 
george annas of boston university school of law and public 
health also on the panel at the university of minnesota 
conference agreed that the data should not be used he cautioned 
about similarities between nazi research and research now being 
conducted in the united states without prior consideration of 
ethical arguments 
the only time we take medical ethics seriously in the united 
states is when it doesnt matter when the scientists can do their 
research anyway annas maintained the main view in science is 
to do the research first and worry about the ethics later 
annas predicted that within a decade scientists will have the 
capability of testing an embryo and determining all of its genetic 
defects as people decide whether to continue pregnancies 
not only will tests be able to determine what diseases a person 
will be born with but also what diseases a person may develop 
later in life he said 
once were able to do genetic manipulation at the embryo 
level well literally be able to manufacture the children we 
want annas said 
such capabilities must not be pursued in an ethical vacuum he 
stressed 
id like to suggest that americas last frontier is morality 
ethics we have to decide what direction were going our goal 
seems to be an antiseptic world in which well all live to be 
100 annas said 
we are tarred by the nazis we cant get out of it until we 
confront it that really is our challenge he added i hope 
this conference will provide impetus to some scientists to take 
values seriously 
but richard king a professor with the university of minnesotas 
institute of human genetics drew a distinction between nazi 
research and what is being done in the united states 
many of the processes that went on in germany are similar to 
what we consider ethical medical practice in the united states 
king said the major difference is that all of the genetic 
community deals with genetics from an individual standpoint we try 
to use our information to educate individuals so they can make 
decisions we do not deal with genetics on a population scale 
king said he believes current research should include a very 
strong ethical component but not that ethical decisions should be 
made before the research is done 
arthur caplan director of the university of minnesota center 
for biomedical ethics said wednesday that renowned scientists 
enabled the third reich to exterminate millions of people in world 
war ii by helping develop gas chambers and by propounding racist 
theories 
scientists he said were not dragged kicking and screaming 
and protesting into nazism

house speaker jim wright struggled thursday to 
halt an erosion of political support stemming from ethics 
allegations as even his supporters talked about finding a 
dignified way to ease him from his post 
its time for a leadership change said indiana rep phil 
sharp becoming one of a handful of democrats to say aloud what 
others have said privately 
its getting to the time where we need stronger and more 
focused leadership on legislation and its become obvious that the 
speaker is so occupied with this thing that he cant devote his 
undivided attention to the leadership of the house sharp said 
late wednesday after a meeting of indiana democratic house members 
wright pinned his hopes on a televised public hearing next week 
gambling that it would give his lawyers a chance to eliminate the 
major charges against him 
i think were going to be successful in these motions i have 
every confidence wright said making a brief appearance before 
television cameras to pronounce himself delighted that the 
house ethics committee had scheduled a hearing for tuesday 
wrights supporters agreed that the motions may be makeorbreak 
time for the texas democrat who is charged with 69 violations of 
house rules but others in the democratic caucus were saying openly 
that regardless of any legal rulings wrights political battle 
already is lost 
were getting down to the short rows now said rep charles 
stenholm dtexas one of the speakers staunch supporters its 
got to quit raining on the speaker the next things that happen 
will be significant and the speaker has to win them 
a group of moderate democrats who have been supportive of wright 
also were talking privately about how badly the speakers political 
standing has slipped 
more than a dozen in the group met late wednesday to discuss the 
speakers defense but wound up talking about whether it was time 
for the party to help wright find a graceful dignified way 
out according to one participant who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
that might include letting the ethics process run its course so 
that the speaker could win at least partial exoneration on legal 
grounds sources said 
while that feeling was not universally shared by those at the 
meeting there was a broader consensus that wright has not been 
getting realistic political advice from the inner circle of texas 
supporters who have clustered about him sources said 
the group discussed how to broaden the political assessments 
reaching wright so that they more accurately reflect the feelings 
of all house democrats 
the ethics committee after a 2hour meeting announced that it 
would hold a sixhour televised hearing on tuesday to let wrights 
lawyers argue why the panel should drop the most serious charges 
against the speaker that he evaded limits on outside income 
through bulk sales of his book and that he accepted 145000 in 
gifts from a business partner with a direct interest in legislation 
we welcome the opportunity for our case and we believe it is 
very very strong to be heard before the public wright said 
wright himself will not appear at the hearing but his legal 
team will argue that the ethics committee has stretched house rules 
in charging their client with wrongdoing 
ethics committee special outside counsel richard j phelan will 
argue the committees position and the ethics panel could rule on 
the issue sometime next week phelans position is very well 
founded said committee chairman julian dixon dcalif 
one of wrights eight lawyers william oldaker conceded that 
motions to dismiss charges routinely are denied and put chances of 
success at no better than 5050 
the ethics panel also voted to release to wrights lawyers three 
documents on which their rules interpretations are partially based 
but it denied the speaker access to advisory opinions on ethical 
questions which the panel has given other house members saying 
that to release them would violate confidentiality the members 
receiving the opinions expect 
the committee also continued to take depositions in an effort to 
wrap up its investigation of wright hearing thursday from tom law 
a fort worth attorney who administers the speakers blind trust 
the panel is exploring a gas drilling venture which netted 
wright a quick 170000 profit last year at a time when he needed 
100000 to pay off a bank loan from a failed nursing home 
investment 
wright said he had not been contacted in connection with a 
reported internal revenue service preliminary criminal 
investigation of his business dealings with fort worth developer 
george mallick 
i cannot imagine that there would be any question on the mind 
of the irs he said and law who manages the blind trust said 
ive not heard of that at all when asked about the irs probe 
late thursday wrights office issued a statement saying that 
gary booth dallas district director of the irs had denied to the 
speakers lawyer that any investigation was being conducted an irs 
spokeswoman citing legal restrictions said she could not confirm 
or deny whether booth had made such a statement 
but the new charge along with continuing questions about 
wrights investment in the nursing home venture jewell 
enterprises clearly worried democrats 
the constant addition of problems has not been helpful 
stenholm said some things have got to break extremely favorably 
for the speaker

his american radio company of the air to be produced by 
minnesota public radio will feature sketches monologues and a 
variety of american music 
lake wobegon will be back in the new show keillor said at a 
news conference thursday but he warned that the town that time 
forgot has undergone changes 
times have been hard back there as they have been all across 
the midwest keillor said its hard to make them into humor 
the program will be performed before theater audiences in new 
york st paul minn and other cities in a 12show series to be 
broadcast live on saturday nights starting sept 30 
keillor who is in san francisco for a public radio conference 
said the show will have the music of fats waller aaron copland 
leonard bernstein hymns and all the great things that every 
american ought to hear at least twice 
the folksy humorist and bestselling author stunned fans two 
years ago when he called an end to his american public radio 
program with an estimated 4 to 5 million listeners in order to 
resume the life of a shy person 
despite estimates of a huge audience keillor calculated he has 
about 13000 true fans while others talk about buttermilk 
biscuits and the home on the prairie show 
when he abandoned sheila the christian jungle girl norwegian 
bachelor farmers and other inhabitants of his mythical hometown 
lake wobegon he said he wanted to flee the frustrations of fame 
including nosy reporters 
standing on stage with his hands plunged in the pockets of a 
gray plaid suit and slowing chewing gum keillor generated guffaws 
when he asked his audience for one more question and make it 
irritable 
after his last prairie home companion broadcast in june 
1987 keillor bid farewell to minnesota for his wifes native 
denmark he returned after he found it hard to work there because 
he didnt pick up the language quickly 
i suppose that was kind of embarrassing too to have failed 
so publicly to have planted your flag so publicly and having to 
pull it out he said 
keillor 46 now calls minnesota home again but also has 
apartments in new york city and copenhagen 
home is a spiritual place he said thursday and in some 
ways i feel closer to minnesota and lake wobegone living in new 
york and copenhagen 
new york is not a nurturing place its an abrasive place but 
you need to have a little skin rubbed off or your sense of humor 
turns sentimental keillor said 
his first book lake wobegon days was about his fictional 
hometown his next was leaving home his most recent is we 
are still married a compilation of letters poems and stories 
written during the reagan years

congress failed to find a way thursday 
immediately to provide needed cash for this years veterans 
programs while the senate finished unusually early congressional 
action on the 117 trillion federal budget for 1990 
the senate approved next years budget on a 6337 vote 
following house approval by a day it was the earliest completion 
date for an overall spending plan in 11 years 
the house ended weeks of partisan stalemate by approving 12 
billion for the department of veterans affairs enough to replenish 
the agencys dwindling coffers through the sept 30 end of this 
fiscal year but the senate provided only enough to keep the 
agencys programs running until june 15 estimated to be about 75 
million 
both chambers acted on voice votes 
the two houses of congress must agree to identical legislation 
before sending it to the white house for the presidents signature 
thus the discrepancy meant that final legislative action was not 
possible until the house returns to work next week 
by providing only a piece of the veterans money the senate 
left itself with a vehicle future legislation containing the rest 
of the veterans funds that might contain dollars for other 
programs favored by senators 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
said there are many many programs that need extra money he 
cited 66 million he would like for a program that gives subsidies 
to air carriers who serve remote communities 
the veterans money had been contained in a multibillion 
measure that had been bogged down because of fights over 822 
million it carried for antidrug programs 
democrats said the drug spending was needed because law 
enforcement agencies across the country were running out of money 
but republicans said the authorities already had more money than 
they could handle the bush administration had threatened to veto 
the bill because of the antidrug funds 
after hours of huddles among party leaders the veterans 
spending was pushed ahead alone the house will resume its 
wrangling over the remaining 25 billion for antidrug efforts 
the costs of fighting last years forest fires and other programs 
next week 
we do realize other things are controversial said house 
appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten dmiss in 
explaining the decision to let the veterans part proceed by itself 
the bill contains money for this year for medical care 
compensation payments and other benefits for veterans with 
congress memorial day recess coming up in several days lawmakers 
admittedly dreaded the prospect of delivering speeches to veterans 
groups with the money still stalled 
how can we go back and talk to our veterans if we are not 
able to deal with the business of this house asked rep 
frederick upton rmich 
while action on the veterans bill was slowed by political 
fencing work on the federal budget was predictably harmonious 
the huge spending plan for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
merely fleshed out a deficit reduction deal that president bush 
and congressional leaders had reached april 14 
that pact worked out usually prickly questions about deficit 
reduction and spending levels decisions that normally lead to 
months of delay and maneuvering until now 1978 was the last time 
work on the budget outline was completed this early in the year 
the house approved the package by a 241185 vote on wednesday 
in both chambers support for the spending plan was broad but 
unenthusiastic 
the budget claims to reduce the federal shortfall by 28 billion 
to 997 billion but even supporters admitted that the measure 
does little to ease the governments longterm deficit problem it 
relies on economc projections that most economists consider overly 
optimistic thereby making the deficit look smaller it also claims 
850 million in savings by moving payments to farmers from next 
year to this year and it includes onetime cash infusions such as 
asset sales 
taking more decisive action is not an option said senate 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn in my judgment 
its a necessity 
the package would hold defense spending to 2992 billion next 
year 46 billion short of the amount needed to match inflation 
domestic programs overall would get about 4 billion more than 
needed to keep pace with costofliving increases law enforcement 
education space and lowincome assistance programs were given 
healthy increases although transportation environment and 
agriculture initiatives were treated more harshly 
foreign aid programs would get 167 billion enough to keep up 
with inflation 
congress would still have to raise taxes by 53 billion and 
agree to limit growth in medicare spending by 23 billion sell 
57 billion worth of assets and raise federal fees by 27 
billion agreeing to specifics could be contentious 
other savings would come from 11 billion worth of changes in 
federal pension programs the government would raise 496 million 
by changing the way the department of veterans affairs sells 
housing loan portfolios and 18 billion by moving the 
moneylosing postal service offbudget 
recipients of social security and other federal income support 
programs would receive their full annual costofliving increases 
civilian and military government employees would be entitled to a 
36 percent pay increase 
some 181 billion would be spent to pay interest on the federal 
debt which is expected to reach 28 trillion this summer 
the budget does not need the presidents signature it is used 
by congress as a blueprint when it passes its later spending and 
taxing bills

a mexican naval vessel fired on and boarded a 
us fishing boat thursday morning in the gulf of mexico after 
accusing it of fishing in mexican waters the coast guard said 
none of the boats three crew members was injured but several 
bullets struck the fishing boat hw junior when the mexican patrol 
used gunfire to stop the vessel said coast guard spokesman capt 
randy peterson 
after mexican authorities boarded the boat the mexican vessel 
left the area and the coast guard ships escorted the hw junior 
into port isabel texas according to a coast guard statement 
the indication is that mexican authorities were correct in 
their action said capt randy peterson a coast guard public 
affairs officer in washington he said international law allows 
police action against vessels outside territorial waters if 
authorities are in hot pursuit 
the coast guard release said the hw junior was 15 miles 
eastnortheast of port isabel when mexican authorities shot at and 
boarded the vessel 
meanwhile mexican authorities announced in mexico city that 
they intercepted an american fishing vessel called the juanita and 
arrested its threemember crew described as two persons of 
nicaraguan origin and one of cuban origin authorities said the 
three were turned over to competent authorities in the port of 
tampico where it said the vessel was taken 
the mexican report did not say when that incident occurred and 
it was not immediately clear whether it referred to a separate 
incident a coast guard duty officer in new orleans steve guy 
said he knew of no report involving a vessel called juanita 
coast guard public affairs officer lt pat philbin in new 
orleans said a coast guard jet and two ships were sent and 
witnessed the boarding after the fishing boat called for assistance 
the incident was apparently sparked over mexican claims that 
the shrimper was in mexican territorial waters said a coast 
guard statement 
philbin said no action was taken against the boat by us 
authorities aside from a warning issued in port because it did not 
have a device to exclude turtles from its fishing nets 
he said the names of the boats crew members were not 
immediately available the hw juniors home port is brownsville 
texas 
philbin said us authorities could not verify whether the boat 
was fishing in mexican waters because they did not observe it prior 
to the boarding 
mexican authorities said the boat was caught fishing about six 
miles off the mexico shore five miles south of the border between 
mexican and us waters philbin said 
state department spokeswoman nancy beck asked if the mexican 
government had been contacted about the incident said she had no 
other details

postimpressionist paintings includes works by paul cezanne claude 
monet vincent van gogh and paul gauguin they will be shown in the

european paintings 
annenberg and his wife leonore accumulated the collection over 
three decades it is accompanied by two cezanne sketchbooks 
annenberg gave to the museum in 1987 and offers a concentration of

what the annenbergs have achieved truly remarkably is its 
not just the good monet it is the monet its not just the 
good renoir it is the right there smackinthekisser renoir 
rishel said 
theyve had the discipline to wait for the very best to come 
then to act 
standing before gauguins 1890s the siesta a colorful oil 
painting of four women in the shade on a porch with a sundrenched 
lawn beyond rishel said if you want a tahitian gauguin you 
want this gauguin it has everything that dazzling light of the 
tropics 
placement of the paintings emphasizes contrasting styles of the 
artists but shows similarities and examples of borrowed ideas 
in one room hangs cezannes imposing portrait of uncle 
dominique as a monk an 1866 painting showing a stern 
blackbearded figure in a white hooded robe against an olive gray 
backdrop 
at the opposite end of the wall is seated peasant a cezanne

a quarter or more of pregnant women may 
unknowingly be infected with the genital herpes virus putting 
their child at risk a researcher said thursday 
pregnant women should tell their obstetricians and pediatricians 
about even apparently minor signs that could signal a silent herpes 
infection said yvonne bryson 
infants born to infected women can become infected during the 
birth process and the childs infection can cause death or mental 
retardation if left untreated but doctors can prevent transmission 
by delivering the child through caesarean section or if a child 
does become infected early treatment can minimize the consequences 
bryson an associate professor of pediatrics at the university 
of california los angeles school of medicine spoke at a 
symposium on sexually transmitted diseases it was sponsored by the 
american medical association and the federal centers for disease 
control 
in an interview bryson said she and ucla colleague lisa frenkel 
studied 1000 pregnant women who had no reported history of genital 
herpes using a blood test not available outside of research 
studies they found evidence that about 25 percent of the women 
were infected with the genital herpes virus 
a study of lowincome black women in atlanta found an infection 
rate of about 65 percent but not all of those women were 
necessarily free of prior signs of infection bryson said 
the risk that an unwittingly infected women will pass the virus 
to her child is low but women without a known history of herpes 
should still be looking for signs that they may be infected bryson 
said 
the signs which occur in the genital area include blisters 
sores bumps and itchy spots she said 
she also said tests to screen pregnant women for herpes 
infection should be developed commercially allowing for widespread 
testing

thousands of armenians demonstrated for the 
freedom of jailed activists and action by the legislature on their 
demands to annex a region in neighboring azerbaijan a local 
journalist said thursday 
about 40000 people in yerevan the capital of armenia took 
part in the twohour protest wednesday in front of the matenadaran 
a worldfamous library of ancient manuscripts said rem ananikan 
deputy director of the official armenpress news agency 
the demonstration was illegal under military regulations imposed 
to restore order in yerevan but no arrests were reported ananikan 
said 
speaking in a telephone interview from yerevan ananikan said 
police initially tried to break up the protest but ultimately let 
it go on 
the protesters were calling for the release of 14 jailed members 
of the karabkah committee which last year launched a campaign for 
armenia to annex the nagornokarabakh region where threequarters 
of the 162000 inhabitants are ethnic armenians nagornokarabakh 
is part of the republic of azerbaijan 
the kremlin rejected the unification demand putting 
nagornokarabakh under moscows direct control instead and jailing 
the committee members 
ananikan said demonstrators also called for an emergency meeting 
of armenias supreme soviet legislature to resolve the karabakh 
issue before a new national parliament the congress of peoples 
deputies convenes in moscow on may 25 
they want the leadership of our republic to get involved once 
again in the karabakh question the armenpress official said he 
said the protesters demanded the unification of karabakh with 
armenia or its complete withdrawal from azerbaijan 
the armenian drive to annex nagornokarabakh launched in 
february 1988 led to ethnic strife between predominantly christian 
armenians and mostly moslem azerbaijanis in which more than 90 
people were killed last year 
after four months of relative calm unrest broke out again in 
nagornokarabakh early this month as armenians accused soviet 
authorities of trying to increase the number of azerbaijanis in the 
district through a crash building program a general strike 
declared may 3 by armenians in the district was continuing 
ananikan said

nasa on thursday said many of the bolts 
holding together space shuttle discoverys booster rockets during 
its august launch will be defective but will pose no danger to the 
flight 
the rockets on atlantis earlier this month also may have 
contained weakened bolts and the same may have been true for 
challenger which exploded on takeoff in 1986 said william d 
hager assistant inspector general for nasa 
we have no reason to believe they have not been on all 
boosters he said at a news conference here 
he added however that there was no evidence that substandard 
or defective bolts had endangered any flights or compromised any 
mission 
national aeronautics and space administration officials decided 
to continue using bolts from companies under investigation because 
the fasteners were in noncrucial areas or had backups to ensure 
safety hager said 
the comments came as hager and us attorney robert genzman 
announced that lee aerospace products inc of chatsworth calif 
had been indicted on charges of lying about the manufacture and 
testing of steel fasteners used by the space agency 
hager said it would cost nearly 11 million to test and remove 
all lee aerospace bolts suspected of being deficient but he did 
not know whether this would be done 
the company has not been suspended or barred from doing business 
with government contractors hager said 
a grand jury indicted lee aerospace president darrell lee and 
vice president jerry martin on fraud charges carrying up to 170 
years in prison and fines of 85 million the company faces a 
maximum fine of 17 million if convicted 
two other los angelesarea aerospace firms ao sammons and 
lawrence engineering co have been charged in similar cases 
sammons pleaded guilty to 43 counts of fraudulent certification 
of bolts the case against lawrence engineering has not come to 
trial nasa said

shops and banks were closed thursday 
and labor activists roamed the streets to enforce a 12hour general 
strike but president carlos andres perez pledged to keep a 
government austerity plan that prompted the protest 
the strike was the first in 31 years of democracy in venezuela 
the strike organizer the venezuela confederation of workers 
claimed it paralyzed the nation 
but perez in a nationally televised news conference held five 
minutes after the strike ended at 6 pm said the government would 
continue with the austerity plan because it is the only way open 
to us 
the president said he sympathized with the working classes hit 
by severe increases in bus fares gasoline and other consumer 
items but he stressed that any reversal would mean a catastrophe 
for venezuela 
in downtown caracas strike supporters surrounded a mcdonalds 
restaurant breaking windows and forcing the restaurant to close 
close it down down with the gringos shouted about 200 
members of the venezuelan workers federation dissuasive 
brigades dispatched to roam the streets and enforce the work 
stoppage 
up with mcdonalds this is a free country customers 
shouted back 
fistfights broke out between union members and store managers 
soldiers were sent in to cordon off the store 
the labor force also forced the closing of several banks that 
defied the strike call 
the 3 millionmember labor federation called the strike to 
protest the austerity measures which prompted riots in february 
and left at least 276 people dead 
the unrest broke out after perez cut government subsidies for a 
broad range of consumer items and public services as part of an 
effort to ease payments on the nations 33 billion foreign debt 
many people blamed labor unions which are closely tied to the 
governing democratic action party for not doing enough to defend 
workingclass people affected by the measures in response the 
union called for the strike 
the government declared the strike illegal but said it would 
avoid useless confrontations that in no way benefit the nation 
squadrons of motorcycle police cruised the streets which were 
empty as most venezuelans stayed home 
labor leaders said the strike closed the nations small and 
medium industries shops banks and public services and paralyzed 
transportation 
all international flights were canceled from 6 am to 6 pm 
travel agents said 
basic industries such as oil and aluminum operated normally 
under a pact worked out between the governmentrun enterprises and 
unions affiliated with the confederation 
venezuela depends on oil exports for 90 percent of its export 
revenue 
planning minister miguel rodriguez said the strike would cost 
the country 300 million in lost productivity

former sen george s mcgovern says he was 
haunted for 40 years by the fear which proved unfounded that he 
had killed an innocent austrian farm family when he jettisoned a 
loose explosive from the army bomber he was piloting near the end 
of world war ii 
mcgovern the liberal antiwar democratic candidate from south 
dakota who was soundly defeated by president nixon in the 1972 
election recalled the troubling wartime incident in a lecture 
thursday night at the national air and space museum 
mcgovern flew 35 combat missions against nazi german industrial 
targets as pilot of the dakota queen a b24 liberator bomber 
with the armys 15th air force based in cerignola italy 
returning to his home base from a bombing run over austria on 
march 14 1945 mcgovern said his crew reported that the plane 
still carried a live bomb which had caught in its rack and was 
dangling from the bomb bay 
the crew finally succeeded in dislodging the bomb before the 
plane landed mcgovern said 
we saw it fall and hit in the middle of a farmyard just as the 
clock showed 12 noon he said the house barn and other 
buildings flew in all directions i envisioned a young farm family 
sitting down for their noon meal blown to pieces 
when i landed back at our base in italy i was handed a cable 
saying that eleanor had given birth to our first child our 
daughter ann the thought went through my mind that we had brought 
a child into the world and that same day i had killed someone 
elses children he said 
in 1985 while he was a guest professor at the university of 
innsbruck in austria mcgovern said he recalled the incident that 
still continued to haunt me many years later during a taped 
interview for an austrian television documentary about world war ii 
after the interview was broadcast he said an elderly 
austrian farmer telephoned the tv station and said that the 
farmhouse i had described bombing was his 
he saw the bomb coming and sought safety no one was hurt we 
hated adolf hitler he said and if bombing our farmhouse helped 
in any way to bring him down tell sen mcgovern we are grateful 
so after 40 years i was exonerated from the incident that had 
bothered me since world war ii mcgovern said 
earlier in the war mcgoverns plane lost two of its four 
engines during a raid on the skoda ammunition works at pilsen 
czechoslovakia in december 1944 
the 22yearold pilot nursed the crippled plane to a safe 
emergency landing despite flames in a third engine on a short 
runway on an island in the adriatic sea that feat earned mcgovern 
the distinguished flying cross 
mcgovern 66 is a fellow at the institute for policy studies a 
liberal washington think tank and lectures frequently on college 
campuses on foreign policy and domestic issues the annual charles 
a lindbergh memorial lecture which he delivered thursday 
celebrates the aviation pioneers historic solo flight across the 
atlantic on may 2021 1927 
mcgovern said he proudly supported the us war effort against 
germany and japan but opposed american involvement in the vietnam 
war which he called the most costly single blunder in our 
national history and a war we did not deserve to win 
mcgovern said soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
initiatives may enable us to end the cold war and reverse the 
arms race he said he hoped the bush administration will have 
the wisdom imagination and courage to seize on these new 
opportunities to build our nation and our international role around 
the new conditions of peace

the justice minister said 
thursday that president jose napoleon duarte has reversed a 
decision to allow 109 wounded rebels to leave the country under 
pressure from the rightist republican nationalist alliance 
justice minister julio samayoa made the comments at an informal 
news conference thursday he told reporters another factor in 
duartes decision was this weeks attack on the san salvador home 
of ricardo alvarenga valdivieso speaker of the legislature 
gunmen on tuesday sprayed alvarengas home with submachine gun 
fire killing a police guard outside 
alvarenga and other leaders of the rightist alliance known as 
arena blamed leftist rebels for the attack the rebel farabundo 
marti national liberation front denied the charge calling it a 
maneuver by arena to lay the blame on the guerrillas and force 
duarte to suspend the evacuation of the wounded 
on tuesday duarte told reporters he had given orders for the 
wounded to be allowed to leave the country 
according to church reports seven of the 109 wounded are blind 
41 are amputees four are paraplegics and seven have lost one eye 
church workers said they should be allowed to leave the country for 
humanitarian reasons and seek further medical treatment abroad 
soon after taking office in 1984 duarte set up the wounded 
rebel transfer program that works with church groups and the 
international red cross duarte has said the program was created 
for humanitarian reasons and in accord with the geneva convention 
the program has permitted 346 wounded rebels to leave el 
salvador the majority receive medical help in cuba and mexico 
the program allows injured rebels to seek proper medical care 
without having to worry about being captured medical care in rebel 
jungle camps is often lacking and rebels who seek medical health in 
city hospitals are subject to arrest 
monsignor arturo rivera damas the roman catholic archbishop of 
san salvador told reporters that the evacuation had been suspended 
but not indefitintely 
rivera damas has been acting as an intermediary between the 
government and the rebels 
the blocking of the evacuation of the injured rebels can be 
blamed on the increase of guerrilla actions the archbishop said 
duartes centrist christian democrats lost the march 19 
elections to alfredo cristiani of arena the rightist party has 
claimed salvadoran law bars people involved in acts of terrorism or 
accused of criminal actions from leaving the country 
cristiani is scheduled to be sworn in as president on june 1 for 
a fiveyear term 
human rights groups including the church estimate that more 
than 65000 people have lost their lives since the civil war began 
in 1979

laughing matters is the title of an 
offbroadway evening of sketches written and performed by the 
comedy duo of linda wallem and peter tolan while a viewer doesnt 
fall apart in helpless bellylaughs one really does laugh a lot 
the title of the evening which opened thursday at the theater at 
st peters church correctly indicates that its focusing on 
situations which are funny 
in the first miniplay a couple meet on a blind date in a 
restaurant the man a nerd who pronounces pate as if it were the 
crown of his head mentally is moving the relationship on 
fastforward and is terribly concerned about aids at a perfect 
moment for getacquainted small talk he blurts can i have a 
throat culture 
in the next vignette tolan is a fasttalking money and 
telephoneaddicted agent visited by a 15yearold recording star 
who doesnt like being different from other girls in a rather 
sweet ending she feels a lot better when mr high pressure relaxes 
long enough to tell her she only has a few more months of stardom 
other skits satirize overconcern with age and what morality in 
government means in washington dc act 2 begins with tolan playing 
piano for three songs he wrote sung by both of them one 
sprinkled with yiddish words comments on how catholics and 
protestants who move to new york become a little jewish it was 
greeted with laughs of recognition 
both halves of the evening end with a couple in champaign ill 
to say that their taste and sophistication is on the backwoodsy 
level is probably placing that a notch too high yelling 
conflicting commands at their children is their childrearing style 
and when once they yell the same thing miss wallem says 
wonderingly that doesnt happen very often 
martin charnin who wrote lyrics for and directed annie 
directed keeping the evening moving crisply zev guber sanford h 
fisher and beluga entertainment corp produced 
miss wallem was born in madison wis grew up in rockford 
ill and attended the university of minnesota in minneapolis 
tolan is from scituate mass and attended the university of 
massachusetts in amherst 
their sketches have variety and humor and though people may yell 
angrily anger and satire never cut deep 
amplified backstage converstions between skits doesnt add 
much for the audience but gives the pair time to change clothes

football star dexter manley told a senate 
panel thursday that he has finally overcome childhood rejection and 
gained selfrespect since seeking help three years agoto learn to 
read and write 
manley a defensive end for the washington redskins graduated 
from houston schools and completed all but 45 hours of 
undergraduate work at oklahoma state university despite a severe 
learning disability that effectively rendered him illiterate 
he enrolled in night classes at washingtons lab school three 
years ago after seeing teammate joe theismann felled by a broken 
leg during a game against the new york giants 
i can recall that vividly manley told sen paul simon 
dill chairman of the senate education subcommittee i had so 
much fear and insecurity i was saying i hope to god this never 
happens to me because what would i do 
manley 30 was judged to have a secondgrade reading level when 
he entered the lab school he was diagnosed as having an auditory 
channel problem that makes it difficult for him to remember what he 
hears particularly rote material like the sounds that letters make 
somehow or another you have to find the will to come 
forward and ask for help thats the most difficult thing for a 
human being to do manley said of his decision at 27 to face his 
problem i had to humble myself i had to walk into the lab 
school and not pretend today i can read and write i have some 
selfrespect 
manley brought with him a written statement but with all eyes 
on him in a hearing room packed with spectators and television 
cameras he began to stumble from the first sentence sweat rolled 
down his cheeks and tears of frustration filled his eyes by the 
time he had reached the second paragraph 
there was a long pause then wally famous amos the cookie 
magnate and a spokesperson for the literacy volunteers of america 
approached the witness table put his arm around manley and spoke 
softly to him 
just tell your story how it came about simon told manley 
after amos had returned to his seat dont worry about that 
prepared statement this takes more courage than anything youve 
done on the football field 
manley obviously relieved scrapped the statement and told 
simon and sen barbara mikulski dmd about receiving 19 grades 
of f in second grade and being placed in a special education 
class for four years 
it was very difficult because i felt i was normal but i was 
told i was dumb and stupid i had a lot of rejection in my life 
manley said athletics was the only thing that built some 
selfesteem some selfworth in dexter manley other than that i 
had no identity 
manley said special education consisted of more or less 
playing with blocks with no instruction in phonics or other 
skills needed to read 
i was passed of course and that repeated itself all along 
he said he attributed his progress through the education system to 
his willingness to show up for class but added its amazing 
that ive come this far ive had a lot of tutoring but i would 
suspect that i was just passed through

president bush acknowledged on thursday 
that his 441 million program to reward excellence in education is 
not a beall and an endall and he challenged americas 
business community to help improve schools 
the fact is that unless we act our children will be 
illequipped to read to write or to understand new technologies 
to compete in the work place bush said 
and the fact is that education partnerships can help us act 
boldly and urgently to keep america no 1 he said 
bush made his remarks in a speech en route to a fourday stay at 
his summer home in kennebunkport maine on saturday he will meet 
visiting president francois mitterrand of france 
the two leaders will travel to boston university on sunday to 
receive honorary degrees make remarks at the schools commencement 
exercises and hold a joint news conference a week later they will

bush made his education speech at an eastman kodak photographic 
plant he praised the company for putting up some of the money that

academic showing to become one of the toprated schools in the 
state 
before his address bush toured the school the wilson magnet 
high school which offers special courses in computer science 
robotics photooptics and japanese language studies 
rochester and kodak embody the notion that helping others 
through cooperation is america at her best bush said 
bushs education program offers 441 million for merit schools 
magnet schools and other programs it has been criticized by 
congressional democrats and educators as insufficient 
no our program isnt a beall and an endall bush said 
were living in times of complicated resource allocation 
but it is a commitment a commitment to help business and 
academia make america much more productive a commitment to 
partnerships a commitment which you share 
the bulk of the money in bushs bill 250 million would go for 
a presidential merit schools program of cash awards to public 
and private schools that make substantial progress in raising 
student educational achievement creating a safe and drugfree 
environment and reducing the dropout rate 
it also calls for 100 million in new spending on magnet schools 
such as wilson offering special courses 
bush said that in visiting rochester i honor the countless 
individuals and companies across america who are following your 
example 
and to those not yet involved i challenge you to get 
involved he said for americas public and private sectors 
they can exceed the sum of their parts 
before leaving washington bush met at the white house with 
nobel prize laureate archbishop desmond tutu and a south african 
antiapartheid delegation

for adopting a resolution saying that panamanian ruler manuel 
antonio noriega was responsible for abuses and the electoral 
crisis in his country the group also voted to send three foreign 
minister to panama to try to induce him to give up power 
saying the white house was pleased by the measure press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said it does constitute a 
condemnation of noriega by name for his abuses of the electoral 
process and calls for a transition of power were gratified 
that all the oas countries shared the united states position 
in kennebunkport bush took his speedboat out into the atlantic 
for a couple of hours his motor got hung up on lobster track lines 
and he had to hang overboard to untangle them while someone hung 
onto his ankles

the government is considering 
lifting the national state of emergency when it expires in june 
because antigovernment protest has died down and the security 
situation is fairly normal an official said thursday 
information minister stoffel van der merwe made the comments on 
staterun televisions evening newscast 
the government is considering thoroughly all aspects of the 
security system in the country in order to decide whether the 
emergency should be reimposed or not he said 
the fact that things are fairly normal there are not so many 
people dying in these days is not necessarily a full conclusion 
that we dont need security arrangements 
although van der merwe made no promises it appeared significant 
that the issue of lifting the emergency was the first item 
mentioned on the evening news 
van der merwe has said in the past that when the government 
wants to make a significant policy change it prepares the public 
for it by opening discussion on the issue 
president pw botha declared the national emergency on june 12 
1986 saying regular laws were insufficient to deal with widespread 
violence in black townships protest rallies and unrest against the 
governments apartheid laws 
under apartheid the black majority of 28 million has no say in 
national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and 
have separate housing districts and schools 
bothas decrees under the emergency allow police nearly 
unrestricted power to detain people indefinitely without charge 
close newspapers ban meetings rallies and church services and 
outlaw organizations 
individuals also may be prohibited from speaking in public and 
criticism against the government police and the army can be banned 
monitoring groups say at least 30000 people were detained 
without charge under the emergency hundreds were freed following a 
hunger strike among detainees earlier this year and an estimated 
50 people still are being held 
van der mewe said the government could soften some criticism by 
lifting the state of emergency which has been condemned by 
governments and human rights organizations around the world 
but he said you cannot afford to let society lapse into 
disorder again in order just to avoid criticism

the first formal talks in months between the 
striking teachers union and the school district took place under a 
news blackout thursday with the situation muddied by conflicting 
reports on school finances 
the strike by at least 22000 teachers in the nations 
secondlargest district was in its fourth day with the 600 schools 
in the 700squaremile district reduced to daycare facilities as 
absenteeism ran high 
student attendance has declined steadily throughout the week of 
the 551759 students enrolled this quarter 283620 were counted 
thursday down from 329371 on monday the first day of the strike 
other than announcing the resumption of talks neither side 
would release any information on the first formal meeting since an 
impasse in march 
there is a total blackout said united teacherslos angeles 
spokesman don schrack on thursday 
the union negotiating team refused to disclose any details of 
the talks including time and place to ensure that no information 
would be released schrack said 
that was something that was wanted and desired by both 
sides said diana munatones a spokeswoman for the los angeles 
unified school district 
union lawyers also sought a court order late thursday to 
prohibit the school district from halting monthly premium payments 
to striking teachers said catherine carey a union spokeswoman 
the district had on its side a factfinders report received 
wednesday agreeing it had no money to offer beyond a 215 percent 
raise over three years 
but confusion reigned after gov george deukmejian announced the 
same day that the state expects a 25 billion budget windfall over 
the next two years 
the states proposition 98 requires virtually all revenue above 
an expenditure limit to be given to the schools the 
594000student los angeles district reportedly could receive 120 
million to 228 million of that money 
but school board president roberta weintraub said the district 
had no assurances it would get the money and could not sweeten its 
wage offer 
deukmejian said he wants to enact budget reform and guide more 
of the surplus toward transportation needs 
united teacherslos angeles president wayne johnson encouraged 
by the windfall report immediately changed the unions demand from 
21 percent over two years to 26 percent over three years 
weintraub called that an impossible figure it is not 
acceptable 
if they stand firm the unions strike is going to continue 
said johnson 
the utla represents 22000 of the districts 32000 teachers 
nurses counselors and librarians the strike is the districts 
first since a 23day walkout in 1970 
currently teachers pay ranges from a beginning 23440 to 
43319 to those with doctorates 98 extra course units and 19 
years experience

communist party chief zhao ziyang and premier li 
peng visited student hunger strikers before dawn friday praising 
their good intentions but urging them to end their sixday 
protest 
the students said they would end their fast only when the 
government agrees to their demands for negotiations they said they 
believed no progress would occur until chinese leader deng xiaoping 
steps down 
on thursday nearly a million people poured into central 
beijing demanding dengs resignation and expressing support for 
the 3000 students who are fasting for democratic reform 
on friday morning thousands began flocking again to the square 
in support of the students showers had turned tiananmen square 
into a squalid squatters camp with students lying on dirty 
blankets strewn across wet plastic sheets 
ziyang dialogue ziyang dialogue the students chanted 
when they first saw zhao at 445 am 
you have good intentions the party general secretary was 
quoted by the official xinhua news agency as saying the problems 
you have raised will eventually be resolved but things are 
complicated and there must be a process to resolve these problems 
but zhao speaking to the fasters said authorities hope you 
will become calm and stop the hunger strike immediately 
xinhua said students cheered and clapped when zhao and li made 
their unscheduled appearance 
but students who talked with the leaders said they were 
disappointed with the visit because both men said they came as 
individuals not as government leaders 
the students said zhao appeared moved by the protest and one 
said zhaos eyes brimmed with tears 
the china daily reported friday that 50000 people were 
streaming into beijing every day to demonstrate for freedom 
staterun radio said the protest has seriously affected 
production in the beijing area 
a source in the peoples liberation army said troops from 
outside beijing were being moved into the city after the 38th army 
which protects beijing notified authorities that it was unwilling 
to suppress the protests 
soldiers from the 38th have seen this movement from the 
beginning and they are very sympathetic said the source 
on thursday li met with student leaders and told them the 
hunger strike has thrown china into chaos students said no 
progress was made in meeting their demands 
government and party leaders have been meeting representatives 
from official student groups to discuss the monthlong student 
campaign for a freer society and less official society 
however they have refused to recognize newly formed independent 
student groups the groups which organized the protests say the 
government must negotiate with them not the official student 
groups 
sparked by sympathy for the striking students the protests are 
the most widespread in communist chinas 40year history their 
broad appeal is reminiscent of the peoples power movement in the 
philippines that ousted president ferdinand marcos in 1986 
the main gripes are corruption and nepotism in the ruling 
communist party and the government 
breakneck economic growth over the past decade has created 
enormous possibilities for malfeasance and laid to rest the 
communists revolutionary ideal of a simple selfless existence 
nostalgia for such an ideal was reflected thursday in the 
posters of former leaders mao tsetung and chou enlai that 
appeared in the marching crowd 
at least chairman mao was honest said a worker from hubei 
province as he carried a lifesized poster of mao he even sent 
his son to the korean war nowadays the leaders send their sons to 
america 
hundreds of thousands called for deng the 84yearold leader 
who started china on its road to reform in 1978 to step down 
high school and elementary school students chanted xiaoping 
xiaoping 84yearsold and not very sharp the tianjin academy of 
fine arts brought out a 6foottall skeleton and attached two small 
bottles to its wrists dengs given name xiaoping is a homonym 
for small bottle 
reports have said deng plans to relinquish his active role in 
setting policy after the chinesesoviet summit soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev left china on thursday 
protests occurred in dozens of other cities wednesday and 
thursday fasts in three and school boycotts in more than 40 the 
official media reported 
more than 2000 of the fasters have been hospitalized since the 
strike began saturday but 1500 of them have returned to continue 
the fast 
premier li and prodemocracy student leaders held a tense 
meeting in the great hall of the people thursday that ended in 
failure after student activist wuer kaixi collapsed as he shouted 
at the premier 
the scene was unprecedented in communist china with wuer a 
21yearold education major at beijing normal university wearing 
hospital pajamas and running shoes shouting down the premier 
li started talking about friendship said a student who was 
at the meeting wuer stood up and told him to stop playing games 
and get down to business 
according to students at the meeting li told them if the 
movement does not end it will be more chaotic than the cultural 
revolution a decadelong political struggle that left hundreds 
of thousands dead 
on thursday one motorcycle gang the dragons sped up and down 
changan avenue revving their engines as they passed the party 
headquarters 
a woman with a black miniskirt and leather gogo boots sat on 
the back of one honda with a flag that read long live

martha clarke known primarily as a creator of 
dreamlike theater evenings among them vienna lusthaus and 
the garden of earthly delights entered another garden a decade 
ago and created a ballet 
she robert barnett artistic codirector of pilobolus dance 
theater and felix blaska who has directed a dance company 
choreographed the 10minute the garden of villandry and danced 
its premiere in paris in 1979 
on thursday night american ballet theater performed it for the 
first time in this city at the metropolitan opera house martine 
van hamel kevin mckenzie and michael owen were the trio or 
triangle pianist howard barr violinist dennis cleveland and 
cellist eric bartlett were the onstage players of a schubert trio 
miss van hamel is embraced and eloquently partnered by first one 
then the other of the men no story is discernable as the three 
stroll and dance in the famous here imagined gardens of a loire 
valley chateau the three dont seem to be a family their 
affection seems excessive for friends taking the air one thing is 
clear theres no jealousy while one man is lifting the ballerina 
in her long bustled skirt the other leans back nonchalantly 
hands in pockets 
at one point the two men swing miss van hamel between them it 
doesnt look like the usual swinging of a ballerina but as though 
shes sitting in a swing hanging from a tree the audience 
realizing that laughed 
the effect is of a pleasant afternoon outing 
on tuesday amanda mckerrow and john gardner danced company 
dancer clark tippets latest work the 25minute duet some 
assembly required they also danced the ballets premiere in 
washington in april music is william bolcoms second sonata for 
violin and piano played by lawrence shapiro and barr 
this long pas de deux begins with gardner in tshirt and jeans 
spending a lot of time on the floor as the ponytailed miss 
mckerrow spins and jumps over him he carries her around his knees 
bent with her feet on his thighs then he lifts her to his 
shoulders and again slides to the floor 
the choreography follows the music and in the second movement 
which bolcom named brutalfast the steps also are fast 
gardner repeatedly flings her away becoming almost menacing here 
as though a game has turned rough 
when the music becomes gentle they face each other on their 
knees and he scoots forward then stands to twirl her a number of 
the movement sequences like facing each other on their knees are 
repeated the final musical movement sounds almost like cakewalk 
music the couple do high jumps and dance in balletic ballroom 
style to it 
neither dance is a favorite on one viewing but neither should 
cause pain or make a ballet goer decide to leave early

rappelling down the side of a 23story 
building to save an unhatched peregrine falcon egg was absolutely 
worth it even though the egg proved to be infertile a state 
preservationist said thursday 
there are so few peregrines left we had to try said thomas 
french the head of the states endangered species program 
french who donned a hard hat and gauntlets to protect himself 
from the diving attacks of the parent birds said he actually felt 
more comfortable inching down the office building wednesday than he 
has climbing some high cliffs to band young ravens 
i had so much gear on i was perfectly safe he said its 
really all in the mind 
the adults popped me a few times on the head and the hand as i 
was going down and once on my boot as i was sitting on the 
ledge french said but mostly all i could feel was the whoosh 
of wings and the wind as they passed 
he estimated that the adults which can reach speeds of 185 mph 
dived at him at speeds of about 60 mph to 70 mph even in the tight 
quarters 
french sent the egg up to the roof in a can but after taking it 
to his conway home in hopes of incubating it thomas p ricardi a 
master falconer said it contained no embryo 
my heart kind of sank ricardi said 
two other eggs in the nest on a ledge at the 21st floor had 
already hatched the first to do so here in more than 40 years 
if the remaining egg could have been hatched the chick would 
have been returned to the nest under a state program to preserve 
the species he said 
falcons swift predators that had all but disappeared from the 
east coast because of damage by the nowbanned pesticide ddt are 
begining to make a comeback after more than a decade of private and 
governmental efforts in the united states and canada french said 
in 1966 there were no breeding pairs left in the east except 
in northern canada he said now we have 80 breeding pairs and 
weve reached a turning point where we have more breeding pairs in 
the wild than in captivity 
since 1974 the private peregrine fund has raised more than 
1000 birds for release in both urban and rural areas he said 
although they normally nest on high cliffs peregrines have 
taken a liking to the high ledges of city skyscrapers where they 
can indulge their taste for pigeons 
massachusetts released young falcons in boston and amherst but 
the springfield pair including a female released in toronto as 
part of the canadian governments restoration program found this 
connecticut river city on their own the male is also banded but 
officials havent yet determined his origin

environmentalists lost a major court 
battle over the rare northern spotted owl thursday when a federal 
judge lifted a ban on logging vast tracts of oldgrowth forests 
administered by the us government 
us district judge helen frye granted a summary judgment 
thursday in favor of the bureau of land management and lifted a 
preliminary injunction that had prohibited the logging of 
oldgrowth forests within 21 miles of spotted owl habitats 
pending any further appeals by the environmentalists the blm 
said the ruling clears the way for sale of 337 million board feet 
of oldgrowth timber in western oregon that has been tied up in 
legal challenges since last summer 
the lawsuit was filed against the federal agency by the portland 
audubon society and other environmental groups they had contended 
the blms timber management plans failed to adequately protect 
oldgrowth forests where the rare northern spotted owl lives and 
hunts 
the owl has been proposed for listing as a threatened species by 
the us fish and wildlife service 
andy kerr conservation director for one of the plaintiffs the 
oregon natural resources council said his group was disappointed 
but not surprised by the decision and added that the case likely 
would be appealed 
if this ruling stands it would only serve to make the listing 
of the northern spotted owl under the engangered species act all 
the more compelling kerr said 
frye ruled that the environmental groups request was too broad 
and that appeals would have to be made on a casebycase basis 
in a 73page opinion she ruled that the audubon societys 
challenge does not seek judicial review of an activity of the blm 
based on sitespecific new information such as the discovery of a 
bald eagle nest or an archeological find or a blow down of timber 
on a particular sale location 
the portland audubon societys challenge cannot reasonably be 
characterized as a challenge to a particular activity for which 
judicial review is available the judge wrote 
they cant challenge our management plans they have to 
challenge individual sales said blm spokesman ed ciliberti 
despite her ruling however the judge was severely critical of 
the blms failure to alter its management plans to take into 
account new information 
she said the agencys action was arbitrary and capricious in 
light of the new significant and probably accurate information 
that the planned logging of spotted owl habitat raises uncertainty 
about the ability of the spotted owl to survive as a species 
ciliberti said the blm would prepare a detailed summary judgment 
for fryes approval then would determine what step to take next 
i think frankly were pleased that shes ruled the way she 
has he said but i think a substantial statement will have to 
wait until our lawyers review the opinion 
he said the agency wouldnt be able to proceed with timber sales 
in oldgrowth timber until frye signs the judgment and he noted 
the environmental groups could appeal 
we do have some sales that are on the shelf that have been 
fully prepared that we might be able to put forth fairly quickly 
ciliberti said 
frye had dismissed the lawsuit in april 1988 but last june 
the 9th circuit court of appeals issued an injunction forbidding 
new timber sales within 21 miles of spotted owl nests on blm land 
in western oregon 
the injunction held up despite repeated challenges by the timber 
industry as a result the blm had to cut its planned timber 
offerings for the year by one third 
the appeals court returned the case to frye who issued a 
preliminary injunction feb 9 reaffirming the logging ban

t 
moscow ap soviet officials publicly asserted for the first 
time on thursday that moscow has halted arms shipments to 
nicaragua but president daniel ortega of nicaragua himself said 
otherwise 
the soviet claim met with skepticism from us officials when it 
was communicated earlier in private 
and on thursday ortega denied in nicaragua that the soviets had 
stopped supplying arms to his central american nation saying they 
continue to fulfill their commitments to his leftist sandinista 
government 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev told a regular 
news briefing the united states is very well aware that the 
soviet union is exercising a certain restraint and in fact for a 
certain time has not been shipping any armaments to nicaragua 
yan a burlyai an official in the ministrys latin american 
department echoed that claim but neither man gave reporters an 
exact date for any halt of arms shipments to nicaragua 
asked by one reporter to spell out for how long a period the 
soviets had stopped the weapons deliveries burlyai replied only 
that it was not one day not two days not one week its much 
more 
burlyai also said shipments of food medicine and bandages to 
the sandinistas could not be properly considered military 
assistance leaving open the possibility that such deliveries by 
the soviets continue 
us officials on monday disclosed that soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev had written president bush that arms supplies to 
nicaragua would halt but the white house said tuesday no proof 
emerged that gorbachev had made good on his promise 
when a reporter asked ortega in niquinohomo nicaragua on 
thursday about the gorbachev letter ortega smilingly replied we 
have normal relations with the soviet union in the fields of 
economic aid military aid the soviet union has met all of its 
agreements with nicaragua 
he added however he is in favor of reaching an 
understanding regarding foreign military aid to central america 
under the esquipulas regional peace pact 
under the pact signed aug 7 1987 by ortega and the presidents 
of honduras costa rica el salvador and guatemala foreign aid 
would end to irregular forces in the region that is understood to 
mean no soviet aid to the leftist salvadoran guerrillas and no us 
aid to the nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
ortega was in niquinohomo a small town 20 miles south of the 
capital of managua to speak on the 94th anniversary of the birth 
of gen augusto cesar sandino the nationalist rebel leader from 
whom the sandinistas take their name 
state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters in 
washington on wednesday that the soviet union may have halted arms 
shipments to nicaragua but weapons were continuing to arrive from 
cuba and moscows east european allies he said the level and 
pattern of arms shipments through april was similar to that last 
year 
boucher said the soviet union and its allies sent 27 shipments 
of military goods to nicaragua through april 
we are not shipping any armaments burlyai said thursday 
while indicating that soviet shipments of other goods for the 
sandinista army may be continuing 
in other remarks made by ortega in niquinohomo 
he charged that the rightwing party of salvadoran 
presidentelect alfredo cristiani was responsible for several 
murders including that of archbishop arnulfo romero of el salvador 
in 1980 
he condemned what he called us intervention in panama and 
wednesdays vote in the organization of american states saying 
the yankees impose the points of discussion on the latin american 
agenda 
the oas voted to send a commission to panama to investigate 
charges of fraud in the may 7 elections which the government later 
annulled

four new parties obtained legal 
status raising to 17 the number of political groups that could 
take part in next februarys general balloting officials said 
thursday 
opposition groups however are still disputing the fairness of 
the electoral laws and it is not yet known how many of them will 
run candidates to challenge the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front 
president daniel ortega said thursday the political opposition 
should not expect any more reforms 
there will be no more concessions i want this to be very 
clear ortega said the reforms that were going to take place 
have taken place and thats the end of it 
ortega made his comment during a speech thursday evening in 
niquinohomo a small community 25 miles south of managua where 
gen augusto cesar sandino was born the speech was on the occasion 
of the 94th anniversary of the birth of sandino from whom the 
sandinista national liberation front takes its name 
five groups asking for legal recognition as political parties 
were rejected by the national council of political parties the 
council approved the request of four other parties said orlando 
tardencilla secretary to council president hugo mejia 
one group the authentic liberal party was denied legal status 
because its slogan neither somocism nor marxism harmed 
another party the marxistleninist popular action movement 
tardencilla said somocism refers to support for the regime of late 
president anastasio somoza whom the sandinistas ousted in the 
197879 revolution 
the council rejected another group the conservative national 
union because although its statutes formally speak against foreign 
intervention they accept it when a government fails to respect 
the principles of western democracy 
other groups were turned down because they had the same names as 
legally constituted parties or did not meet minimum requirements 
under the law 
critics say the reforms in election and news media laws were 
passed by the sandinistadominated national assembly or 
legislature without considering opposition demands they say the 
reforms are merely cosmetic and still give the sandinistas an 
unfair advantage 
in a letter to the national reconciliation commission chaired 
by cardinal miguel obando y bravo the opposition repeated its 
complaints and accused the government of failing to live up to its 
commitments of democratic reforms in a regional peace accord 
vice president sergio ramirez said his government cannot 
accept that the national reconciliation commission become a 
negotiating panel between the government and the opposition because 
this is not its role 
under a central american peace accord signed in february 
president daniel ortega moved up elections by 10 months to feb 25 
1990 and promised legal reforms to ensure the balloting is free 
and fair 
ortega and his colleagues from el salvador honduras costa rica 
and guatemala also agreed to draft a plan by may 15 to dismantle 
the nicaraguan rebel force now encamped in honduras near the 
nicaraguan border the deadline was later extended to a yet 
unspecified date in july by mutual accord

students heading the largest demonstrations ever 
to confront communist china have specific demands they say must be 
met before they halt their protests and less defined demands for 
changing the longrange political character of china 
their conditions for ending a hunger strike by thousands of 
students on tiananmen square center around demands for government 
recognition of their new independent student organizations 
as a first step the students say the government must engage in 
a televised dialogue with student representatives acknowledgement 
of the activist groups as the voice of the students must follow 
the government has talked to delegates from official student 
unions but has balked at recognizing the new studentelected 
groups 
one major factor is government concern that independent student 
groups could be followed by workers breaking away from the 
statecontrolled trade unions and interest groups forming political 
parties opposing the ruling communist party 
students also demand that the government apologize to the nation 
through the peoples daily the communist party mouthpiece for its 
criticisms of the student movement students are particularly 
incensed over an april 26 editorial that accused the students of 
being agitators bent on causing social turmoil 
communist party chief zhao ziyang and other leaders now refer to 
the students as patriotic and have met student demands that 
there be no violence or recriminations against them but they have 
not responded on the issue of a written apology 
the broader demands are less defined but focus on official 
corruption press freedom and the resignation of top leaders 
students have demanded that senior officials disclose their 
incomes as one step toward ending the corruption bribery 
influencepeddling profiteering in scarce goods and nepotism 
that is rampant among officials and bureaucrats 
student demands for press freedom have in part already brought 
about significant changes the staterun press pressured by 
journalists supporting the students has given extensive 
sympathetic and factual coverage to the demonstrations before the 
current protests that would have been impossible 
the students continue to demand the rehabilitation of qin benli 
editor of shanghais liberal world economic herald who was removed 
from his job in the early days of the protest for attempting to 
print articles critical of government leaders authorities have 
since stopped publication of the weekly 
although student leaders have not come out against the 
government many protest participants are carrying banners and 
signs demanding the resignation of top officials 
a main target is 84yearold deng xiaoping the father of 
chinas economic reforms who students say is now too old to 
understand the rapid changes china is undergoing 
students also are calling for premier li peng to step down li 
is accused of incompetance and is generally associated with more 
conservative factions who favor slowing economic and political 
reforms 
students also have demanded more money for the nations 
underfunded and inadequate educational facilities and better 
treatment for teachers among the nations poorest civil servants

president bush promises to veto faster than 
the eye can see a raise in the minimum wage and republican 
lawmakers are confident bush will win his first domesticpolicy 
clash with capitol hills majority democrats 
there are enough votes in the senate to support a presidential 
veto senate republican leader bob dole said wednesday before the 
senate gave 6337 approval to legislation increasing the minimum 
wage for the first time in eight years 
doles prediction was borne out by the fact that the final vote 
was four votes short of the margin that would be required to enact 
the bill over a bush veto 
democrats pushing the measure vowed nonetheless to press their 
case with the president and while refusing in advance to concede 
defeat said they would advance another bill if bushs first veto 
is sustained

the mushroom treatment is not the latest in 
french cuisine and fort fumble is not on the list of defense 
department installations to be closed down next year 
both are examples of pentagonese that pinnacle of bureaucratic 
jargon used by the men and women responsible for americas national 
security 
fort fumble the fudge factory and the fivesided wailing wall 
are names used more or less affectionately by the 23000 people who 
work daily in the 37 million square feet of office space in the 
pentagon 
jargon may be the most distinguishing feature of the building 
erected in the early months of world war ii in a style known as 
early ugly but on closer inspection pentagon palaver 
resembles that of other big bureaucracies in which separate offices 
compete for money attention and jobs 
as in any bureaucracy those who work in the pentagon but 
havent learned the lingo risk the mushroom treatment defined by 
author perry smith as being kept in the dark and fed on manure or 
something equally tasty 
the retired air force major general in his book assignment 
pentagon has compiled a glossary not only of defense department 
gobbledygook but of the acronyms that the military uses in 
smiths words as a shortcut language for defense issues 
bmews for example is not a verb meaning to stupify but is the 
nations ballistic miissile early warning system gwen is not a 
womans name but the ground wave emergency network 
mirv and sam are deadly multiple independently targeted reentry 
vehicles and surfacetoair missiles jstars is not a breakfast 
cereal but the joint surveillance target attack radar system 
mad is already familar as mutual assured destruction moa and 
mou are not fruit from south seas but a memorandum of agreement 
and a memorandum of understanding 
pols are not the folks elected to congress but petroleum oil 
and lubricants slep is not yiddish for to carry but is the 
surface life extension program for aircraft carriers 
warmaps are not what you think but wartime manpower planning 
systems and wtvd is not an easylistening station but a combined 
english and russian acronym for the western theater of military 
operations the european front 
the glossary includes these other tidbits 
above my pay grade perhaps the most commonly heard expression 
along the 13 miles of pentagon corridor it means go ask 
someone more important 
analysis paralysis what happens when you study excessively 
bears big bosses feeding the bears means giving 
information to senior commanders 
bedbug letter an effusive nonresponsive answer to a 
complainer similar to one from the president of a motel chain who 
never mentions the bedbugs in his letter of apology 
bells and whistles hyperbole to sell a weapons system 
bow wave large financial requirements that appear on future 
rather than current budgets 
bfo a blazing flash of the obvious 
elephants another word for big bosses as in lets solve 
this before the elephants get involved 
elevator speech a short two or threeminute briefing 
face time time spent near big bosses in attempts to impress 
them with diligence and loyalty 
night face face time with bosses at night counts twice as 
much as day face time 
weekend face counts four times as much as day face 
go ballistic get overly excited 
gold plate add lots of systems to a weapons platform 
pearl harbor file a complete record of an action so that when 
disaster strikes you can trace the course that led to the disaster 
purple suiter an officer who works in a joint command as

nbc is showing some class this weekend by giving 
its nowlukewarm but once sizzling detective series miami vice 
an honorable sendoff in a special twohour conclusion sunday 
the series that launched don johnsons career and a wave of 
fashion trends is leaving the air after five seasons unlike abc 
which allowed its onceballyhooed moonlighting to whimper away 
in soso final episode that ended up at the bottom of the nielsens 
nbc is giving vice the coveted sunday movie slot 
the producers and the network have refused to prescreen or 
discuss the episode in order to keep the ending a secret but 
executive producer michael mann has a penchant for the dramatic he 
ended crime story prematurely it turned out by 
incinerating his villains with no less than an atomic bomb 
when miami vice premiered in 1984 it amazed jaded 
television critics with its fresh writing charmingly seedy 
characters and art deco miami landscapes the show derived from a 
nowfabled scribble of an idea by nbc entertainment president 
brandon tartikoff mtv cops 
anthony yerkovich a producerwriter on hill street blues 
created the characters and wrote the twohour pilot which still 
stands as one of the best cop shows ever 
the look came from michael mann then a relatively obscure film 
director the jericho mile thief who knew how to put film 
and rock music together in a way that made hair stand up on the 
back of necks beginning with the opening montage set to pounding 
synthesized caribbean rhythms created by jan hammer 
thomas carter hill street directed the first episode and 
american tv entered a new era of style cool colors hot sounds 
straightfromthecharts music such as phil collins in the air 
tonight wafted from television speakers in the middle of network 
prime time 
the show didnt catch on in the ratings until summer reruns 
when word of mouth got around in later seasons the kids favorite 
show met its ratings demise ironically enough at the hands of 
cbs aging nighttime soap dallas 
in the beginning vice viewers were as intrigued by the 
characters as the color scheme don johnson was virtual unknown 
with a credit list of failed pilots and ignominious movie parts 
but he connected with sonny crockett a downattheheels former 
football star who lived on a boat guarded by an alligator named 
elvis 
another unknown philip michael thomas played ricardo tubbs an 
interloping black cop from the new york streets who came to miami 
looking for his brothers murderer city slicker tubbs and 
goodolboy crockett were the classic odd couple and were 
naturally forced to become partners nbc will try the unlikely 
buddies concept again in a new cop show hardball that goes 
into vices time period next season 
vice might have impressed the critics but it was virtually 
ignored by the hollywood establishment it won only a handful of 
technical emmy awards except for edward james olmos 1985 win as 
best supporting actor in a drama olmos joined the cast midway 
through the first season as martin castillo a mysterious taciturn 
successor to the cops first boss gregory sierra who left the 
series 
if the industry establishment ignored vice the feeling was 
mutual mann shunned the usual tv writers and hired playwrights and 
authors to create his scripts he bypassed the pool of hollywood 
regulars and cast new york stage actors in guest roles 
the late playwright miguel pinero short eyes wrote for 
vice and played tubbs archrival calderon bruce willis who 
later became a star on moonlighting had only an off broadway 
production of fool for love to his credit when he was cast as 
an arms dealerwife beater in an episode rock star glenn frey made 
his acting debut in an episode based on his song smugglers 
blues 
the show took chances in a remarkably sophisticated episode 
evan crockett and a onetime partner william russ confronted 
their longhidden mutual guilt over the suicide of another partner 
they had rejected because of his homosexuality 
in the last three seasons the show drifted away from character 
development and flirted with selfparody it still hit the mark 
sometimes but by then was taken for granted 
vice lives on on cable usa network bought the reruns

when local boosters chose a bavarian theme 
to turn this depressed mining town into a fairytale tourist 
village they had in mind a cinderella transformation 
after four years what theyve got is more like beauty and the 
beast 
a quaint wooden sign proclaiming willkommen zu kellogg sits 
near a milelong heap of mining debris downtown falsefronted 
shops mimicking old german architecture share main street with 
dumpy dirty brick buildings 
kellogg is not the first downandout western town to try to 
revive itself by dressing up as something its not tourists with a 
good road map and a willingness to suspend their disbelief can find 
simulated frontier cowboy towns bavarian hamlets and 19thcentury 
mining villages scattered across the west 
but the theme town concept successful in some places faces 
a serious challenge in this northern idaho town after four years 
of having its seamier side covered up painted over or carted away 
kellogg still resembles more the rough mining town it is than the 
charming village it wants to be 
that does not daunt town fathers who remember how things were 
grocer bob chapman sums it up by describing his cavernous metal 
warehouse store now trimmed with stained wood and painted flowers 
its still ugly but its improved a great deal 
life in kellogg couldnt have gotten much worse than it was in 
1981 when the bunker hill silverleadzinc mine closed 
unemployment soared to 50 percent and 80000 homes suddenly 
became 30000 homes when a buyer could be found at all 
it was small comfort that bunker hills two towering smokestacks 
no longer belched noxious smelter fumes across the valley years of 
smoke had already done their damage turning onceforested hills 
into barren eroded slopes and lacing the yards and gardens of 
kellogg with toxic lead cadmium arsenic and mercury 
the 1980 census counted 3417 people in kellogg by 1986 that 
number had fallen 22 percent to 2650 as city leaders watched 
business after business fold they desperately sought something to 
keep kellogg alive 
they found it in leavenworth wash a little town in the 
cascade range that adopted a bavarian alpine theme in 1966 when it 
too was on the edge of ruin now the thriving village of 1400 
boasts 26 gift shops and 19 restaurants all meticulously fashioned 
after the quaint shops and cottages of old bavaria 
kellogg set out to copy that success civic leaders started a 
muralpainting flowerplanting campaign the city council passed 
an ordinance to require that all commercial construction or 
remodeling be done in the bavarian theme and be approved by a 
design review committee 
the centerpiece of the towns conversion was to be a 31mile 
tram ride linking the towns center and a nearby ski area but no 
private investor would touch the risky venture it took a 64 
million federal grant assailed by president reagan as pork barrel 
but approved december 1987 by congress to make the gondola 
project a reality 
construction began last month and boosters say the gondola will 
kick kelloggs conversion into high gear 
a kick clearly is needed fewer than 25 percent of the buildings 
downtown have gone bavarian and even those arent entirely 
convincing 
on one block a jewelry store masquerades as a turreted castle 
next to a pawn shop with a ski chalet facade next to a dress store 
painted like a quaint country cottage next to a flower shop with a 
clock tower that chimes tunes from the sound of music 
people come in and say this isnt really bavarian we say we 
dont care it looks nice said city clerk terry sharp 
there are local critics too including dennis seagraves owner 
of dirty ernies tavern his only concession to bavaria at the 
review committees insistence is the old english lettering on his 
sign 
when i was growing up i thought you had freedom of choice 
he said with the bavarian theme you either do it their way or 
you dont do it at all 
pauline watson a leavenworth gift shop owner and traveling 
consultant on theme towns has doubts about kelloggs chance of 
success she has seen many communities get excited about becoming a 
theme town only to lose steam when they realize the financial 
investment and longterm commitment involved people see it as a 
magic cure but its not she said 
sometimes it does work leavenworth has prospered and so has 
solvang calif drawing tourists with a danish theme since the 
1940s winthrop wash has become a convincing old west town 
kimberley british columbia has gone bavarian and just 12 miles 
from kellogg the town of wallace idaho is trying to build on its 
silvermining heritage 
kellogg is at a disadvantage watson said because it is far 
from a large population center and its business district is too 
spread out to concentrate shoppers 
but kelloggs boosters prefer to dwell on the positive they 
cite the allure of northern idahos mountains lakes rivers and 
forests and they say interstate 90 which cuts through town will 
carry in moneyspending motorists 
there are other reasons for optimism they say the bunker hill 
mine has reopened on a smaller scale employing fewer workers but 
sparing residents the pall of smelter smoke by shipping its ore 
elsewhere for processing 
a few eroded hills around town still cant support vegetation 
but most slopes now sprout lines of planted pines and firs and the 
environmental protection agency plans to start digging up 
leadcontaminated yards and carting in fresh soil this summer 
boosters say kelloggs greatest cause for hope is the unflagging 
determination of its residents 
several hundred of them attended a recent groundbreaking 
ceremony for the gondola dignitaries on a crepe papercovered 
stage spoke of kelloggs bright future of hard work paying off 
the high school band played the the starspangled banner and 
the crowd cheered as fireworks exploded over a nearby slag heap 
kellogg has a long way to go said bill scudder chamber of 
commerce president but youve really got to admire this 
community it has never said die

kazuo okuyama began his career with typical 
japanese movie fare gangster and cute animal movies 
now the ambitious young producer hopes to inspire jaded japanese 
with the tragedy of an idealistic rebellion in 1936 which tried to 
install a military government under the late emperor hirohito 
okayamas problem in making the film due for release june 17 
has been that the attempted coup by 22 fervent young rightwing 
military officers was quashed under orders of hirohito himself who 
was then revered as a living god 
the emperor isnt portrayed in the film but his order against 
the young rebels whom okuyama describes as martyrs is depicted as 
a misjudgment that ultimately led japan into world war ii the 
producer said 
reflections on the emperors judgment and the question of his 
responsibility for the war are acutely sensitive here although 
discussion of hirohitos historical role has become freer since his 
death jan 7 at age 87 
historians generally agree hirohito was a figurehead wielding 
little real power his most famous decision was japans world war 
ii surrender in 1945 when the government was deadlocked over the 
issue 
but hirohito also ordered the 1936 leaders of the coup back to 
their barracks after two days of assassinations and political 
turmoil in the 226 incident so called because it was launched 
on feb 26 
several coup leaders committed suicide and others were 
imprisoned on july 12 1936 two civilians and 13 of the rebel 
officers were executed by firing squad 
okuyamas movie 226 tells the story of the young officers 
who led about 1500 soldiers and nine civilians in a bloody attempt 
to overthrow the government and install a military regime under 
hirohito 
the rebels claimed they sought to restore integrity to a nation 
they believed was corrupted by a political elite living in luxury 
while millions suffered depressionera deprivation many of the 
rebels historians say were sons of poor farm families who had 
suffered hunger and seen their sisters sold into prostitution 
but in the repressive atmosphere after the failed coup an 
opposing faction in the military used the incident to build its own 
power eventually establishing a militaristic regime that led japan 
into world war ii 
there was an energy and an intensity alive then that has been 
forgotten in todays japan the 35yearold producer said 
one main reason i wanted to produce this film is because we 
live in a similar era when young women prostitute themselves and 
revelations of political corruption surface every day said 
okuyama the only difference is that then we were poor and now 
were rich 
the film is coming out amid outrage over a scandal in which 14 
prominent bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on 
suspicion of bribery and other illegalities and more than 150 
people embarrassed by disclosures that they accepted unlisted 
shares at discount prices from an employment information firm 
i wanted to sound an alarm to use the tragedy and drama of 
the 226 incident to tell people what they dont want to hear about 
political corruption and decay okuyama said 
influential people are gathering dirty money like the martyrs 
of 226 people should care 
the film depicts the deaths of the coup leaders as a tragic loss 
of courageous young men who died still true to their ideals 
even though the emperor doesnt understand that we were right 
history will answer for us says one coup leader before putting a 
bullet in his head 
okuyama said in an interview that he knew a decade ago that 
there was material to make a good movie but it just wasnt 
possible because of a lack of funds and sensitivities about the 
emperor 
the screenwriter didnt want to get involved he said but 
finally agreed on the condition we play down politics and aim the 
movie more toward young people 
corporate backers also feared a backlash from rightwing groups 
that vociferously protest anything they interpret as disrespectful 
toward the imperial family 
when we get to the last print just before distribution we 
plan to show the film to some of the major rightwing groups to try 
to gain their understanding okuyama said 
but he still expects some trouble actually im very worried 
just now very afraid but even if theres controversy i think i 
can explain what were trying to do 
the film ends on a note the rightists should appreciate a clash 
of gongs and tenno heika banzai or long live the emperor

when talking heads rhythm sectionspouses chris 
frantz and tina weymouth decided it was time to delve back into 
their roots the place to begin was obvious cbgbs 
it was in the funky manhattan club on the bowery where the heads 
first surfaced as part of the burgeoning newwave scene that 
produced blondie and the ramones and so the tom tom club returned 
to headline a threeweek stand announcing their comeback after a 
sixyear absence 
it was fun we saw all the old people you know the old hard 
core at cbgbs said weymouth bass player with talking heads 
we had a lot of technical problems but it was great fun 
we had people come up dee dee ramone jerry harrison debbie 
harry lou reed people really appreciated it 
so did the tom tom club the nonheads project of drummer frantz 
and bassistvocalist weymouth husband and wife they liked it so 
much the band is currently doing a nationwide tour of clubs and 
campuses returning to the smaller venues where the heads started 
out in 1977 
chris and i were really in fear of leading insular lives 
it seemed important to get out of that ivory tower weymouth said 
in a recent interview we feared selfindulgence we began to 
go back to our roots 
the results are evident on boom boom chi boom boom the 
current tom tom club album featuring covers of bob dylan she 
belongs to me and lou reed femme fatale 
the whole point being to try to find out what it was again 
that had made us really keen and interested in music said 
weymouth and we wanted to stay well clear of what talking heads 
were doing 
touring she said will insure that the heads havent toured 
since some dates early in 1984 tom tom clubs summer tour of north 
america will run through august 
in addition to giving frantz weymouth and bandmates mark roule 
guitar and gary pozner keyboards a chance to perform live it 
will also give talking heads rhythm section a chance to do 
something outside the constraints of their other band 
even though talking heads always tried to avoid the pitfalls 
of being defined by our image just the fact that we got successful 
meant that it did kind of confine us to a certain set of 
definables said weymouth 
although its all of our band very much from the point of 
view of lyricwriting and melody it is very much a david byrne 
vehicle which is great but we wanted to have it more open so 
its not always going to be the same lead singer the same 
lyricist 
for their third album tom tom club also went for a different 
sound than its earlier wellknown dance hits wordy rappinghood 
genius of love or the man with the 4way hips 
weymouth is resigned to the fact certain people wont like what 
her band is doing these days and she means either talking heads 
or tom tom club 
people who never liked talking heads as a threepiece resented 
it when we added jerry harrison and when we ceased to be a quartet 
and came onstage with eight or nine people the same thing 
happened oh they were great back then said weymouth 
the bassist sighed and shook her head 
this is often the case people who were not at all into rap 
music and hiphop in 1980 now remember genius of love and wordy 
rappinghood oh those were great cuts cant you do something 
like that again and you just have to laugh

the beard is tinged with gray but george 
lucas whose trilogies of star wars and indiana jones have 
written film history still conveys the boyish wonder of the 
moviestruck kid from modesto 
lucas who just turned 44 came to town from his northern 
california empire to do some interviews for indiana jones and the 
last crusade which seems certain to restore the luster of his 
golden touch after a series of monumental hits lucas productions 
turned sour with labyrinth and howard the duck 
his 55 million willow performed decently in this country 
and impressively abroad but critics complained that lucas was 
repeating himself lucas traditionally has paid little heed to 
critics pursuing his own course at the lucasfilm headquarters 
north of san francisco 
director steven spielberg and star harrison ford have indicated 
that the last crusade will be the last of the indiana jones 
adventures does producerstorywriter lucas believe it will be 
probably he said unless i come up with some completely 
inspired idea three i think is a pretty nice number 
we originally thought about doing three of them we wouldnt 
have done the second one the temple of doom unless we came up 
with a story that we all thought was fantastic and really wanted to 
do we werent really interested in making a film just to be making 
a film 
the last crusade comes five years after the temple of 
doom which followed raiders of the lost ark by three years 
the longer gap said lucas was due to failure to find a script the 
three principals agreed on 
i wanted to do a film about the holy grail steve thought it 
was too abstract an idea lucas said we developed a story on 
another idea which didnt turn out menno meyjes came in to do 
another screenplay and he didnt like that idea we started 
talking about the grail and decided to try to sell steven on it 
the screenplay is credited to jeffrey boam 
one of the major mythological threads of the grail is inner 
happiness and fulfillment which really deals with compassion and 
caring about other people in relationships in that its a natural 
evolution to relationships with your parents 
that resulted in the role of the senior jones for sean connery 
in his early thinking about indiana jones lucas had figured the 
character had been raised by a father who was a teacher but that 
was as far as he had gone the father role was written for an older 
man a john houseman type but spielberg announced i want 
sean connery 
lucas was reluctant at first but he agreed after talking to the 
scottish actor about the script the casting proved to be 
brilliant beyond our wildest imaginations said the producer 
theres nothing new to report on a resumption of the star 
wars saga originally planned as a triple trilogy by lucas 
its still sitting on the shelf he said itll be a few 
years before i get back to it thats the way those things work 
ive got to get motivated by ideas and themes and that sort of 
thing before i can go back and do it ive got a lot of other 
things im more interested in at the moment 
one of them is a modern story a small film for a change he 
plans to write the script whenever he can find the time and 
surprise he would direct it himself hailed as a superior 
director with american graffiti he has not directed a film 
since the original star wars 11 years ago 
directing he observed is a lot of fun and a lot of work as 
producer i get some of the fun without all the work ive likened 
the difference between producing and directing as the difference 
between coaching and being the quarterback theres a joy in both 
but theyre two different jobs 
i was a quarterback for a while and i was a coach for a 
while lucas said i can go back to being a quarterback if the 
situation seems right

the city water tower was in sight just above the 
waves breaking on the florida coast to the 101 haitian men women 
and children jammed into a ramshackle 50foot boat the tower 
beckoned as if it were the statue of liberty 
the group had sailed at least 500 miles from hopelessness in 
haiti toward a vision of new lives in a prosperous land 
but 1000 yards before reaching the threemilewide ring of us 
territorial waters that vision evaporated a coast guard cutter 
called escape appeared and the haitians were taken aboard and 
returned to their capital portauprince 
had they gotten inside the territorial limit the us 
immigration and naturalization service would have been obliged to 
grant them asylum hearings 
few have come quite as close before being stopped by the 
governments haitian interdiction program which critics say not 
only dashes dreams but also discriminates against a predominantly 
black nation 
supporters say the program protects florida shores and cities 
from being overwhelmed by illegal aliens who come here seeking jobs 
in 1981 haiti gave the united states permission to patrol the 
waters off its shores picking up the thousands who try to leave 
the poorest country in the hemisphere each year 
in those eight years more than 20000 people have been stopped 
under the haitian interdiction program 
its clear theyre playing games with the black refugees 
said gerard jeanjuste director of miamis haitian refugee center 
he believes the policy is intended to keep blacks from entering 
the united states while latin refugees have been welcomed 
in january thousands of central and south american bus 
people streamed into miami after a federal judge ruled they could 
no longer be held near their points of entry in texas 
they were accommodated in a public stadium opened to hold them 
after the city determined that a private shelter was dangerously 
overcrowded although the immigration status of many is uncertain 
they havent been sent back to their homeland 
during violent miami racial disturbances in january some black 
leaders said perceived racism in the treatment of haitians and 
latin aliens was among the sparks to violence 
immigration officials deny the interdictions are racially biased 
if we could prevent the people in central america and south 
america from reaching our borders we would do that said verne 
jervis assistant director of public affairs for ins in washington 
its a different situation 
haiti is the only country with which the united states has such 
an arrangement ins officials say 
but miami ins district director perry rivkind said it makes 
sense 
there is no choice whatsoever he said that is the 
heaviest movement to the united states in this hemisphere 
the coast guard says approximately 1300 people were picked up 
at sea in march alone more than in the first two years of the 
program combined 
several factors help explain the increase 
at the time of the march wave a rumor was circulating that the 
us government had relaxed its immigration policy 
another factor has been political instability in haiti a series 
of coups and coup attempts followed the overthrow of the duvalier 
family dictatorship three years ago 
the business and economic achievements of many haitianamericans 
also are a lure rivkind said 
you now have a haitian community thats very successful he 
said pointing out that haitians own numerous thriving businesses 
in south florida 
he described the wave of haitian wouldbe immigrants as a 
standard immigration trend where those left behind in the homeland 
follow the pioneers who came to america and made good 
the difference is the others generally came legally he 
said referring to european immigrants who arrived earlier this 
century and were abosorbed into the american melting pot 
as for the haitians he said i think the whole island would 
be here if it could 
rivkind is concerned about the implications of the situation 
which has spurred angry protests by miami haitian advocates and 
simmering tensions at a detention center on the edge of the 
everglades on may 11 rivkind said immigration officers headed off 
a riot plot by seizing homemade weapons and placing 700 
undocumented aliens most of them haitians under lockdown 
the tension from it isnt very conducive to good will 
rivkind said 
jeanjuste agreed 
i hear haitians yelling long live castro us is racist 
they dont like black he said 
jervis explained that us immigration law works best for people 
who have a wellfounded fear of their governments who have family 
here and who have job skills that will sell in the united states 
the problem is that many people from third world or developing 
countries those people dont fit either one of those categories 
and they dont have relatives here so theyre not eligible to 
enter he said 
the way haitians try to escape their homeland indicates how bad 
things are there 
the coast guard usually discovers them crammed aboard homemade 
open sailboats with a cooking area but no toilets petty officer 
luis diaz said the situation of those who suffered the nearmiss 
in march is typical 
you come in you say thanks god but i dont know how many 
of my brothers and sisters got killed in the sea water said a 
haitian who asked to be called timmy he came by boat in 1980 
interdictions are hard on the men and women of the coast guard 
whose job forces them to deal firsthand with the haitians 
desperation 
weve got to look at it in a positive way said diaz many 
may make it but many may not at least were trying to save their 
lives 
in april the coast guard doubled its interdiction patrols 
stationing vessels hundreds of miles southeast of florida to reduce 
the time and effort involved according to jeff karonis spokesman 
for the seventh coast guard district 
but that cuts resources devoted to another mission the 
increase in patrols is all coming out of vessels assigned to drug 
operations karonis said 
our flexibility is greatly reduced and thats just one more 
thing we have to deal with down here

the democraticcontrolled congress gave final 
approval to legislation raising the minimum wage for the first time 
in eight years but president bush said it was inevitable he 
would kill the measure with the first veto of his administration 
the vote wednesday was 6337 to approve the plan which would 
boost the minimum wage from 335 an hour to 455 by october 1991 
that vote left supporters shy of the 67 needed in the senate to 
override bushs veto 
majority democrats are short of a twothirds override margin in 
the house which passed the bill earlier this month but sponsors

speculators sold mcgrawhill inc stock after 
the company announced a standstill agreement barring british 
publisher robert maxwell from attempting to take over the company 
for 15 years 
the pact with maxwell communications corp was part of a joint 
educational publishing venture between maxwell affiliate macmillan 
inc and mcgrawhill announced wednesday 
mcgrawhill fell 575 a share to 69 in composite new york 
stock exchange trading wednesday 
the market is saying it is a less likely takeover candidate 
because mr maxwell has been an active buyer of media properties 
said analyst peter appert of cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc 
but he added maxwells one player in the universe it seems 
to me the stock is way overreacting 
analysts said the selloff was led by speculators abandoning 
mcgrawhill because of the reduced likelihood that the company 
which has been considered a weak performer in recent years would 
be acquired 
they speculated that maxwell proposed the standstill to allay 
fears he would go after new partner mcgrawhill considered a 
takeover target for some time 
macmillan spokesman david adler declined to say whether maxwell 
had made buyout overtures toward mcgrawhill the new yorkbased 
publishing and information services company 
maxwell one of the worlds 10 biggest communications 
information and publishing groups owns no stock in mcgrawhill 
adler said 
maxwell communications offered to enter into the standstill 
agreement and mcgrawhill accepted mcgrawhill spokeswoman betsy 
russo said we have nothing more to say than that 
the joint venture in elementary secondary and vocational 
education publishing combines units of macmillan and mcgrawhill 
that had 440 million in total sales last year 
londonbased maxwell last year acquired new yorkbased macmillan 
for 25 billion after a bitter takeover battle 
the combination of macmillans educational business with that 
of mcgrawhill is a dramatic illustration of the high quality of 
the publishing businesses we acquired in macmillan robert 
maxwell said in a statement 
the publishing venture will create a new chicagobased company 
macmillanmcgrawhill school publishing co equally owned by 
mcgrawhill and macmillan 
mcgrawhill units that will enter the venture are its school 
division gregg division ctbmcgraw hill and educational 
resources the units accounted for about 9 percent of mcgrawhills 
total 1988 revenue or about 165 million operating profits of the 
divisions was 85 million 
macmillan units in the deal are its school division glencoe 
division and barnell loft operations mcgrawhill will buy maxwell 
communications science research associates and london house for 
190 million and place them in the new company 
the macmillan units last year had combined revenue of about 275 
million or about 20 percent of macmillans total revenue 
operating profits totaled about 40 million 
this restructuring of our elementary and high school units 
into an independent entity fits nicely with our strategy to develop 
core businesses with significant market share mcgrawhill 
chairman joseph l dionne said 
analysts said the deal would catapult the new company to among 
the top four elementary and high school publishers 
mcgrawhill has not been a power in the elementary and high 
school side they definitely take a step up in the ranks 
appert said its going to help mcgrawhills profit quite a 
bit 
mcgrawhill which also owns business week magazine four 
television stations and the standard amp poors credit rating 
service earned 1855 million last year on revenue of 18 
billion maxwell communications reported 2305 million in 1988 
profit on sales of 19 billion

miffed at what it called an hysterical and 
irresponsible rejection of its 21 billion takeover bid amway 
corp withdrew its offer to acquire rival avon products inc 
the move came late wednesday just hours after avons board 
rejected amways 39ashare offer saying that uniting the nations 
two biggest companies in persontoperson sales would cause a 
culture clash with disastrous consequences 
the boards rejection of amways bid had been expected given 
previous statements from avon that the company was not for sale 
avons stock had edged down 12 cents a share to close at 
4012 in consolidated new york stock exchange trading amway 
which had sought a friendly deal and had indicated it would be 
willing to increase its offer withdrew after the market closed 
in a letter to amway a privately held directselling concern 
based in ada mich avon chairman james e preston said the board 
reviewed the acquisition proposal thoroughly before voting 
unanimously to turn it down 
we are convinced that our shareholders longterm interests 
will best be served by avon remaining independent preston said 
in the letter released from the companys new york headquarters 
avons shares are undervalued and dont reflect the companys 
improved prospects preston said noting we are confident that 
the longterm value of the avon common stock is significantly 
higher than 39 per share 
avon lost 4045 million in 1988 on revenue of 306 billion 
the loss came as avon continued the process of divesting its 
operations in the healthcare services field so it can focus its 
efforts on enhancing its beauty and directselling businesses 
preston said avons management is turning the company around 
so from a shareholder perspective now would be the worst time to 
sell the company 
the lengthy letter sent on behalf of the avon board contained a 
litany of reasons why avon objects to amways interest one of the 
key objections was that there would be dangerous friction in trying 
to meld the two companies 
combining our cultures would be disastrous to our business 
the letter said it would create hostility within the sales force 
and would destroy avons good name 
in response amway characterized avons rejection letter as 
hysterical irresponsible and irrelevant as well as vicious 
and irrational it described avons charges as baseless 
reckless and defamatory 
amway said it doesnt intend to pursue a bid as long as avons 
board maintains its current hostile position that the company is 
not for sale under any circumstances 
analysts and investors believed amways offer was too low and 
some valued avon as high as 45 a share amway may have 
intentionally made a lowball offer in the likelihood that no 
other competitive bids would surface they said 
avon said it conducted a survey this week in which almost half 
of its topselling sales representatives responded that they would 
quit rather than be associated with amway nearly 40 percent of the 
representatives in the united states said they would probably 
leave also 
avon has about 425000 sales representatives in the united 
states and another 1 million agents marketing avon products in more 
than 80 foreign countries 
avon had planned to mail letters to shareholders today providing 
details of its plans avon spokesman john cox said shareholders 
would be told the basis for the boards decision not information 
about antitakeover tactics

eastern airlines boss frank lorenzo has accused 
the carriers striking unions of brainwashing members and has asked 
psychiatrists to study the materials sent by strike leaders to the 
rank and file 
in a speech last friday to students at stanford universitys 
business school lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air 
corp said the psychiatrists met in washington to examine the 
union literature 
texas air spokesman art kent said the company had no immediate 
comment on lorenzos remarks an account of lorenzos speech in 
palo alto calif was released by the business school 
we have people here in the unions who have been totally 
completely brainwashed said lorenzo as quoted by the stanford 
press release 
we have in fact a meeting going on today in washington 
dc by a bunch of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts who are going 
through the propaganda materials that these people are being sent 
and this is brainwashing in the style of the 40s 
what is being put into their heads gets them excited about 
giving up their jobs and giving up their careers 
it was unclear from lorenzos remarks whether he had hired the 
psychiatrists it also was unclear how he intended to use their 
analysis of the union materials 
dan ashby a spokesman in new york for the eastern pilots union 
on wednesday called lorenzos remarks a continuation of his 
desperation tactics 
we would suggest that mr lorenzo sit down with these people 
the psychiatrists and find out what his own problems are he 
said were very sane people were very serious about what were 
doing 
since march 4 pilots and flight attendants at miamibased 
eastern have supported a strike by the airlines machinists union 
lorenzo put eastern into chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on march 
9 
protestors threw eggs in lorenzos direction before he entered 
the auditorium to make his onehour speech and called him 
hitler and greedy bastard when he left the business

a federal jury has rejected a womans claims that 
gd searle amp cos cu7 birth control device caused her 
infertility marking the companys 15th victory of 19 cases that 
have been decided in court 
the jury in us district judge rya zobels court concluded 
wednesday that the cu7 device was not responsible for any alleged 
injury of the plaintiff cindy nickerson the jury also found in 
favor of the other defendant ortho pharmaceuticals manufacturer 
of the lippes loop intrauterine contraceptive 
we are pleased that the massachusetts jury was persuaded by 
the weight of science the long history of safety and 
effectiveness of the cu7 and the continuing endorsement of the 
product by the medical community said william i greener jr 
searle spokesman 
so far 19 such cases have gone to a judge or jury said searle 
spokeswoman kay bruno 
weve won 15 of the 19 of the four losses two are completed 
cases and two are on appeal she said unfortunately there are 
still cases pending against the company 
although most of the cases thus far have favored searle the 
company was ordered last year to pay damages to a minnesota woman 
in the amount of 875 million which was later reduced by a judge 
to 815 million 
ms nickersons attorney anil madan said an appeal is being 
considered she criticized defense attorneys conduct 
we felt that the defendants particularly searle made the 
plaintiff a victim and paraded her sexual and personal history 
before the jury madan said 
searle maintains that its product is safe when used properly 
the product is still approved by the fda as safe and effective 
when used by its label bruno said while we have not been in 
the iud market for three years now we have said that we would 
vigorously defend this product 
three years ago searle discontinued its iud business in the 
united states citing difficulty in getting product liability 
insurance and the cost of defending against suits

researchbased company that develops manufactures and markets

eastern airlines proposed plan to rebuild as a 
smaller carrier and sell 18 billion in assets could gain critical 
support at a meeting today of the committee representing its major 
creditors 
the creditor panels financial advisers investment firm 
goldman sachs amp co and accountants ernst amp whinney have 
concluded that easterns restructuring plan may be feasible and are 
expected to present that view to the committee sources close to 
the situation said wednesday 
that would add to the building momentum in favor of the 
strikebound carriers proposed plan as prospects for a sale of 
eastern as a whole appear to dim some observers and sources said 
court officials have labeled as inadequate the buyout proposals 
submitted so far by two investor groups a federal bankruptcy judge 
has approved the idea of selling the airlines prized northeast 
shuttle and eastern has moved further along with its own plan to 
sell assets and reorganize as a smaller carrier 
the judge on wednesday gave eastern permission to lease 14 
boeing 727200s to pan american world airways for 579 million 
over three years as part of its restructuring plan eastern had 
signed a tentative agreement with pan am to lease the jets for 
966 million over five years eastern has announced similar 
agreements with other carriers in recent weeks but the pan am deal 
was the first approved by the bankruptcy court 
some union representatives admitted privately that the recent 
developments were a setback for the unions because of the 
likelihood the airline would be broken up something the unions 
have opposed strongly 
they eastern seem to sort of win by default said one 
union operative who asked not to be named 
the longer it drags on the less value eastern brings to a 
buyer said paul karos an airline analyst for first boston corp 
something has to happen very quickly 
miamibased eastern has been under chapter 11 protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the start of a paralyzing 
strike by its machinists union that was supported by pilots and 
flight attendants the bankruptcy court must approve any sale of 
eastern or any of its assets including the shuttle service 
david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner for eastern said 
at a bankruptcy hearing tuesday there were no real live offers 
to buy the entire carrier and challenged suitors who have made 
proposals to risk at least 100 million of their own cash for any 
purchase 
two investor groups one headed by chicago commodities trader 
joseph ritchie and the other headed by former piedmont airlines 
chairman william howard have submitted formal bids in response to 
shapiros request the ritchie group said it planned to revise its 
proposal with a new plan that would include substantial equity 
capital 
also on tuesday us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland said 
eastern had provided valid reasons for its plan to sell the new 
yorkwashingtonboston shuttle eastern already has an agreement to 
sell the shuttle to developer donald trump for 365 million but 
lifland gave the airline until monday to consider a higher bid by 
america west airlines 
joel zweibel the attorney representing easterns major 
creditors said they supported a prompt sale of the shuttle 
the growing likelihood of a shuttle sale coupled with the 
apparent lack of credible buyout offers for the whole airline 
bolster easterns proposed plan to cut its size and sell another 
14 billion or so in assets separately some observers say 
easterns unions tried to put a good face on the developments 
shapiros statements on the inadequacy of the offers are a 
blessing in disguise because they will draw out improved bids 
from the suitors and speed up the process of reviving eastern 
pilots union spokesman dan ashby said wednesday in new york 
however some union sources suggested privately that a sale of 
the shuttle which long has been vigorously opposed by the unions 
could crush their morale and may even prompt eastern pilots to 
return to work 
easterns parent texas air corp had no comment on the matter 
spokesman art kent said 
phoenixbased america west has offered to pay 415 million for 
the shuttle and 336 million for 10 boeing 757s in a total package 
worth 751 million 
trumps 365 million agreement with texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo expires on may 27 under their contract the developer 
would receive 8 million from eastern if the shuttle deal collapses 
america west has said it would not employ eastern employees if 
it purchased the shuttle while trump has recognized the eastern 
unions for his shuttle

some consumer advocates say an agriculture 
department plan to speed up federal inspection at major cattle 
slaughter plants is enough to ruin your summer barbecue 
but a meat industry official says the criticism is 
sensationalism and irresponsible 
a coalition of consumer and labor organizations was adamant 
however in calling on usda to withdraw the proposal and redesign 
it with the views of consumer and public health groups in mind 
sen patrick leahy dvt and rep kika de la garza dtexas 
also have been asked to support the move to have usda recall the 
proposal the consumer advocates told a news conference wednesday 
the proposal was announced dec 1 an extended period for public 
comment ended this week but no final decision is expected by usda 
for some weeks or months 
under the departments streamlined inspection system for 
cattle called sis by the bureaucracy federal inspectors at 40 or 
50 of the largest slaughter plants would turn over some of their 
responsibilities to company employees 
the idea is to let inspectors concentrate on checking for 
abcesses tumors and other abnormalities in the heads and innards 
of slaughtered cattle instead of spending so much time on seeing 
that that workers keep hair mud excreta and other contaminants 
from beef headed for consumers 
one result would be to speed up the lines of carcasses moving 
along the inspection route as this is done inspectors would have 
less time to do their jobs 
manly molpus president of the industrysupported american meat 
institute said his organization has repeatedly urged that usda not 
put the new system into effect until it is reviewed by an 
objective third party panel of scientific experts to ensure that 
meat safety would not be diminished 
molpus said in a statement that attempts to use 
sensationalistic meat safety tactics to discourage 
modernization of the federal meat inspection system which dates 
back to 1906 are irresponsible 
mudslinging through the media does nothing to further a 
reasoned debate on how to modernize the inspection system he 
said 
but carol tucker foreman who oversaw federal meat inspection 
while an assistant secretary of agriculture in the carter 
administration told reporters the usda proposal would define clean 
beef as the average quality of product produced by the 
slaughter plants 
in other words she said whatever is produced becomes the norm 
the average or aesthetically acceptable product that meets 
the interpretation of federal standards 
foreman said the proposal if implemented would shift 
responsibility for food safety away from federal inspectors sworn 
to uphold the law and protect the public health to plant management 
whose first concern is profit 
moreover she said the plan would allow increases in speed of 
carcass lines which would push up already high injury rates in the 
meatpacking industry 
foreman said it also could lead to higher beef prices for 
consumers because only the 40 or 50 largest packing companies would 
use the new streamlined procedures giving them a competitive 
advantage 
department officials say the 40 or 50 largest plants account for 
about 80 percent of the nations beef output in all there are 
approximately 1700 federally inspected slaughter plants that 
handle cattle 
usda is out to ruin your summer barbecue ms foreman said 
in a statement beef is a favorite food of the american people 
especially during the summer cookout season which we are fast 
approaching unfortunately the usda has proposed regulations that 
will call into question the safety and wholesomeness of beef 
stamped usda approved 
steven d chockerham a usda meat inspector who works at a 
montfort inc plant in grand island neb said the plan which 
has been tested at the grand island plant and in several other 
locations is based on statistics averages and odds in hopes 
that contamination rates will be kept in bounds 
but chockerham a member of the american federation of 
government employees and a whistleblower working with government 
accountability project one of the consumer groups in the 
coalition said he has seen evidence to the contrary 
chockerham said he kept an informal unofficial but accurate 
record of slaughtered cattle heads coming across his inspection 
station and found that 24 percent were contaminated including 
hair hide and stomach contents the contamination rate under the 
old procedures was about 3 percent he said 
linda golodner executive director of the national consumers 
league said the streamlined system would demean the traditional 
usda stamp of approval on beef

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter is being 
urged to think hard about opening up millions of acres of longterm 
conservation land to haying and grazing in droughtstricken areas 
yeutter is under pressure from capitol hill and other quarters 
to approve haying grazing or both on highly erodible land taken 
from crop production under the conservation reserve program 
but kenneth a cook vice president for policy at the center for 
resource economics and justin r ward senior project associate of 
the natural resources defense council said wednesday it is 
premature to open up the crp as a source of livestock feed 
in the 1988 drought the agriculture department approved haying 
on millions of acres of crp land in dozens of states but none has 
been approved for haying or grazing in 1989 
cook and ward said in a letter to yeutter that several major 
farming areas face the possibility of a second consecutive year of 
severe drought 
it is early in the growing season and the threat will not 
materialize if moisturedeficient areas in iowa kansas nebraska 
and other states receive the amount of rainfall the national 
weather service has recently forecast the letter said 
it is understandable cook and ward said that many farmers 
particularly livestock producers are extremely anxious at this 
time 
but they told yeutter we urge you to proceed with 
deliberation and caution in any decision to open the crp the 
public has already invested billions of dollars in the crp and will 
invest billions more in the years ahead 
such investment yeutter was told could be compromised if usda 
does not establish clear consistent criteria and procedures 
for deciding on the emergency use of crp lands 
more than 28 million acres have been set aside under the crp and 
is supposed to remain out of production for 10 years the contracts 
specify that protective grass and trees must be planted to project 
the fragile soil from wind and water erosion 
in return farmers get initial financial help from usda to plant 
the grass and trees each year they get federal rental payments 
averaging around 50 per acre these currently cost about 15 
billion a year 
any decision to open the crp in selected counties will result 
in requests and increased pressure for similar treatment of 
additional counties cook and ward said and since drought 
afflicts some part of the country every year it is safe to assume 
that you will face similar decisions about the crp year in and year 
out 
they added this year and in future years we urge you to 
establish a formal public procedure for making determinations 
about emergency use of the crp we feel this procedure should 
include consultation with farm environmental and wildlife 
interests and between usda and the us fish and wildlife 
service

the latest survey by the agriculture 
department shows that prospects for summer water supplies in much 
of the west have declined from last month because of belowaverage 
precipitation and early snowmelt 
warm temperatures and sunny skies throughout the west in april 
caused snowpack to melt sooner than usual for the month wilson 
scaling chief of the departments soil conservation service said 
wednesday 
april precipitation was below average or well below average 
throughout the region except in the pacific northwest and montana 
he said consequently seasonal forecasts have been reduced in most 
basin areas 
early runoff improved reservoir storage dramatically 
scaling said however inflows have already begun to taper off in 
many basins 
april precipitation was less than 50 percent of average in the 
southwest except for pockets of above average precipitation in 
southern arizona southeastern new mexico and central colorado 
streamflow forecasts have been reduced throughout the west 
through september scaling said however nearaverage flows are 
expected for most rivers in oregon as well as for the upper 
columbia the upper snake and along the mainstem of the yellowstone 
river 
nevada is the only state where reservoir storage is well below 
average he said summer inflows to reservoirs are likely to be 
below average in all western states 
the west depends on snowmelt for about 75 percent of its water 
supply

the world bank will loan mexico the 
developing worlds secondlargest debtor nearly 2 billion to fund 
two hydroelectric projects and help reduce its interest payments 
the government has announced 
the announcement by finance minister pedro aspe on wednesday 
came the same day mexico resumed negotations in new york with a 
15member committee representing creditor banks and two days after 
the government liberalized its foreign investment rules 
the new loan package will support structural changes 
undertaken by the federal government in the financial industrial 
commercial and staterun sectors aspe said 
one portion of the resources will be utilized for debt 
reduction serving as an important advance in the process of 
renegotiation with foreign creditors aspe said without 
elaboration 
only brazil at 118 billion has a higher foreign debt among the 
developing countries than mexico which owes creditors 1074 
billion 
aspe said the money could be available almost immediately 
once the world bank directors approve the package and would be 
directed toward developing hydroelectric projects and debt 
reduction he did not allow reporters to ask questions 
aspe said only that the loan would fund a government 
hydroelectric project in the western state of nayarit and in the 
central state of hidalgo 
the loan recognizes the achievements in stabilizing the 
economy and control of inflation and the fundamental objectives 
of mexicos economic program for 198994 the minister said 
consumer prices in mexico rose 159 percent in 1987 a record 
high then slowed to 52 percent last year 
the loan supporting the staterun sector recognizes the 
advances the federal government has undertaken to make stateowned 
companies more efficient and rationalize subsidies aspe said 
president carlos salinas de gortari has pledged to sell off some 
moneylosing state companies long protected by his predecessors 
cut inflation and modernize the economy 
on monday commerce secretary jaime serra puche announced new 
foreign investment regulations that open some sectors of the 
economy sheltered by years of protectionism and increase the amount 
of foreign ownership allowed in others 
the new rules open up previously closed areas such as auto 
parts telecommunications fishing and petrochemicals production to 
a maximum of 49 percent foreign investment 
other industries mexico deems strategic such as banking 
petroleum mineral exploration transportation and broadcasting 
will remain offlimits for foreign investors 
also wednesday an official of the international monetary fund 
was quoted as saying that international lending organizations and 
private banks could allow a 20 percent reduction in mexicos debt 
service 
the staterun notimex news agency quoted eduardo borenstein as 
saying that debt reduction would be the inevitable result of 
negotiations between debtors and creditors

the proposed combination of the computer 
reservations systems of two of the nations major airlines is 
troublesome but could produce more competition if properly 
structured the department of transportation says 
in a letter and accompanying summary to attorney general 
richard thornburgh transportation secretary samuel skinner raises 
concerns about the proposed merger of the crs operations of 
american airlines and delta air lines 
but skinner says assurances that the new partnership would be 
operated separately and would not favor either carrier could remedy 
his departments concerns about the deal 
both american and delta said wednesday they viewed the letter as 
a favorable development 
we have said from the beginning that we wanted other 
partners said bill berry spokesman for atlantabased delta 
we are talking to several foreign and domestic carriers who want 
to buy as little as 1 percent and as much at 10 percent 
it wont even be like a subsidiary said john hotard a 
spokesman for fort worthbased american it will be keeping an 
arms length from each of the other owners and make marketing 
decisions on its own 
the proposed transaction now before you has the potential to 
adversely affect competition in the crs industry and the airline 
industry skinner said in his letter dated monday 
the merger could combine the largest and smallest of the five 
firms in the crs industry which are controlled by two of the 
largest and most successful members of the airline industry 
while we do not believe that competition in the crs market is 
threatened so seriously that the transaction should be challenged 
on that basis we do believe that the transaction as currently 
structured poses a substantial likelihood of producing an adverse 
effect on airline competition by being used as an unfair 
marketing weapon for american and delta the nations number one 
and number three carriers respectively skinner said 
thus we believe the transaction should be challenged unless it 
is modified to include at least one additional airline owner and 
to assure separate management and marketing of the surviving 
system 
in a summary of its findings however dot says with adequate 
assurances that the new company will be controlled and operated 
in a carrierneutral manner the transaction could actually 
benefit airline competition if it makes the largest us crs a 
truly neutral distribution tool 
american and delta announced the joint partnership in february 
under the deal delta would pay american 650 million and they each 
would own half of the resulting company 
initially the airlines said they would sell up to half of their 
shares in the partnership for 20 million for each percentage 
point three months later they cut the price to 15 million for 
the first 20 percent to spur interest in gaining another partner 
under the stillunnamed partnership americans sabre system 
would eventually absorb deltas datasii system an acknowledged 
weak point of the airline 
computer reservations systems are used by travel agents to book 
airline tickets sabre has been the industry leader but also has 
been the target in the past of government complaints that it 
unfairly favored american flights 
american subsequently changed the program to answer those 
complaints and now operates as a neutral unbiased crs that sells 
a whole assortment of travel products hotard said 
the justice department is expected to decide by early june 
whether it will challenge the merger on antitrust grounds

blinder robinson amp co inc has been accused by 
florida officials of scheming to defraud its customers and the 
comptroller moved to stop the company from doing any business in 
the state 
florida comptroller gerald lewis announced wednesday that the 
denverbased company with offices nationwide was ordered to 
immediately stop its alleged violations of florida securities laws 
blinder robinson could lose its florida license and faces more 
than 5 million in fines as a result of the states 2year 
investigation into alleged market manipulation of penny stocks 
lewis charged that the firm licensed in florida since 1973 
made millions of dollars in illegal profits by inflating the 
purchase price of certain stocks beyond the legal limit conducting 
excessive stock trades just to earn commissions and buying and 
selling stock without clients permission 
penny stocks are lowpriced thinly traded securities that 
generally cost less than 5 per share and are traded over the 
counter 
in a statement issued wednesday company officials said blinder 
robinson was in full compliance with florida law and would 
vigorously defend itself against the charges 
rick rouse director of compliance for blinder robinson said 
the florida department of banking and finance had acted 
irresponsibly in its action 
whenever there have been problems we have addressed them i 
cannot rationalize how the department could neglect to ask for our 
cooperation before instituting such an action he said we 
intend to pursue all appropriate recourse 
the florida action cited numerous infractions of state 
securities laws including sale of unregistered securities 
unreasonable markups failure to maintain proper records 
unauthorized trading and scheming to defraud 
it also named 29 former and current employees including the 
companys president meyer blinder and vice president larry 
blinder his son 
the case has been turned over to the statewide prosecutors 
office for possible criminal prosecution lewis said 
blinder robinson has 21 days to ask for a hearing to stop its 
florida license from being revoked which would prohibit the 
company from conducting any securities business in florida the 
firm has 10 branch offices and 423 agents in florida 
the history of their company is one of litigation lewis 
told a news conference in miami were ready for battle 
the firm has been under investigation in other states and by 
federal authorities state securities officials say thousands of 
investors in florida may have been victims of blinder robinsons 
practices 
an example of the firms alleged market manipulation involved 
the sale of shares of onnix financial group inc lewis said in 
addition to selling the original shares at up to a 112 percent 
markup blinder robinson allegedly sold nearly 42000 nonexistent 
shares he said 
the companys troubles with the securities and exchange 
commission date to 1980 and include a massive probe initiated by 
the sec in april 1987 into allegations that it defrauded customers 
the sec has been investigating allegations stretching back to 
august 1983 that blinder robinson violated federal law by 
marketing nine distributions of unregistered securities by falsely 
representing the business prospects of the companies involved and 
by excessively marking up the prices of the securities 
the sec had two other actions pending against the company for 
alleged bookkeeping violations 
company attorneys have contended that the government had a 
vendetta against the firm blinder said negative publicity 
devastated business in 1988

the state office of energy resources will 
investigate why wholesale gasoline prices rose 22 cents a gallon 
from march 10 to april 21 
energy secretary sharon pollard said among the issues to be 
examined is whether the oil industry is exploiting the march 24 
exxon valdez oil spill in alaska 
the goal of this investigation will be to get to the bottom of 
this issue and determine whether the oil companies are just lining 
their pockets or whether these increased prices are justified 
pollard said 
consumers are outraged and we intend to give them some 
answers she said 
prices at the pump have increased 9 to 15 cents per gallon 
indicating some of the wholesale price increases have been absorbed 
by the companies and not passed on to consumers 
oil company executives and some independent energy analysts said 
the valdez spill had little or nothing to do with the price 
increase 
i dont think youll find that more than 5 percent of the 
increase was related to the valdez accident henry lee director 
of harvards energy and environmental policy center and former head 
of the state energy office told the boston globe 
companies seized the opportunity to raise prices faster and 
higher than they would have and it made a huge financial impact 
said edwin rothschild a consumer activist who organized a 
nationwide boycott of exxon 
they probably would have tried to pass those increases through 
gradually but this was sudden and extreme 
lee said one factor in increased prices was the loss of 420000 
barrels of oil a day because an oil platform in the north sea 
broke that has panicked all the gasoline refiners in europe 
from which northeast states get a lot of their fuel he said 
frank tivnan director of the massachusetts petroleum council 
which represents gasoline refiners and sellers said investigations 
in massachusetts and new york should prove that policies of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries air pollution 
regulations increased demand and expensive changes at european 
refineries led to the price increases 
he said the opec price increase accounts for 8 to 9 percent of 
the retail price increase 
the demand by northeast states for gasoline that is slower to 
evaporate and so will cut summer emissions of dangerous organic 
compounds makes fuel more difficult to get and more expensive 
tivnan said 
he said oil executives and a study by the us environmental 
protection agency said prices would rise because of the new 
gasoline 
if the valdez had any effect on oil prices it was simply a 
psychological effect on the west coast for a few days or week 
tivnan said after a week or so tanker traffic returned to 
normal

three days after blueberries are plucked from 
the bushes in bacon county clerks place them on shelves in west 
german supermarkets so winterweary shoppers can satisfy their 
craving for fresh fruit 
last year south georgia growers exported 105000 pounds of 
rabbiteyes native blueberries bred from wild plants the 1988 
crop totaled 52 million pounds and was valued at about 4 million 
this year growers are shipping southern highbush varieties such 
as georgia gems an early ripening berry that goes to market about 
two weeks ahead of rabbiteyes when prices are highest freezing 
temperatures last winter has cut this years crop roughly in half 
but export efforts continue 
a few hours after harvesting the berries are packed in plastic 
baskets and trucked to jacksonville fla for a flight to 
frankfurt 
theres a demand for fresh blueberries in that part of the 
world were trying to cash in on it said danny stanaland the 
county extension agent in alma an agricultural community of about 
5000 that bills itself as the blueberry capital of georgia 
georgias blueberry industry has been growing since the early 
1970s when farmers began experimenting with the fruit as an 
alternative crop 
while tobacco is still the top cash crop in the area stanaland 
said blueberries have gained in importance corn and soybeans 
wouldnt pay the bills but fortunately we have blueberries to pick 
up the slack he said 
currently about 3000 acres are devoted to blueberries 
trade experts point to blueberry exports as an example of new 
business opportunities for south georgia a rural region plagued by 
poverty and high infant mortality the area has been described as 
the other georgia because it has lagged behind atlanta in 
sophistication and economic growth 
the world is growing smaller and even an area like south 
georgia can be involved in international trade if you have the 
right product said horticulturist gerard krewer a fruit 
specialist with the georgia extension service 
athens ga economist keith scearce said forestry and farming 
can provide many export opportunities but businesses will have to 
make a special effort to develop new markets 
youve got to get people thinking bigger than they have in the 
past said scearce 
shipping blueberries to germany would have seemed like an 
impossible task a decade ago but now its viewed as a growing 
opportunity for farmers 
stanaland said local officials are seeking federal funds to 
improve almas airport and growers are considering the possibility 
of using the communitys 5000foot runway to ship their berries 
directly to germany 
we would like to say that one day we can pick our berries and 
take them to our local airport he said that way we might be 
able to pick them today and sell them tomorrow wherever there is a 
demand 
we know we have something good he said we hope the world 
likes it

sunningdale holdings ltd a group linked with 
british investors jacob rothschild and james goldsmith said 
thursday it has agreed to buy a 299 percent stake in britains 
ranks hovis mcdougall plc currently held by goodman fielder wattie 
ltd of australia 
sunningdale said it agreed to buy the stake at 400 pence or 
648 a share contingent on the failure of a current takeover bid 
by ranks hovis for goodman fielder if the bid succeeds 
sunningdale will be entitled to a payment of 50 pence 81 cents a 
share 
last month ranks hovis a baking and foods concern offered the 
equivalent of about 21 billion for goodman fielder the biggest 
food processor in australia and new zealand 
the bid represented a turnaround in a longstanding battle which 
last year saw the australasian groups 28 billion takeover bid 
for ranks hovis thwarted by a british government investigation into 
its impact on competition in the foods sector 
the entry of sunningdale to the fray represents the first joint 
investment venture by goldsmith and rothschild since the pair 
announced plans to create anglo leasing plc in march anglo leasing 
is to be owned equally by goldsmith and rothschild companies which 
also have holdings in sunningdale 
rothschild and goldsmith have said the aim of their new company 
would be to acquire one or more large publicly quoted british 
companies which could benefit from restructuring 
goodman fielder which has been seeking a buyer for its 299 
percent stake in ranks hovis since its bid for the british foods 
group lapsed last august stands to make a windfall gain on the 
sale 
in its recent talks with ranks hovis goodman fielder has 
indicated it might be willing to proceed with a merger but only on 
its own terms it has rejected the initial goodman fielder offer 
saying it doesnt adequately reflect the value of the company 
ranks hovis which currently holds a 149 percent stake in 
goodman fielder said the sale breached one of the conditions of 
the bid adding that it was still considering what actions to 
pursue

when roseanne barr sizes up a stack of bills 
swamping her televisionshow husband she tells him pay the ones 
marked final notice and throw the rest out 
the advice from the abc comedy star on a recent episode was 
meant as a joke but many reallife bill payers sometimes do just 
that unaware they could possibly create a blackmark on their 
credit rating that mysterious dossier used by everyone from banks 
to employers to decide whether youre responsible 
while most people know a file on them exists somewhere theyre 
not sure exactly who keeps it whats in it or how to track it down 
its a real web said robert morton head of the united 
consumer credit alliance a miamibased consulting group a lot 
of people are confused 
credit files exist on nearly all adult americans and are kept 
primarily by four large private credit bureaus with offices 
nationwide these bureaus get their information from lenders and 
in turn sell it to creditors evaluating consumerloan applications 
each file contains three types of information personal data 
such as a social security number and address record of payment 
and legal records such as court judgments involvings debts or 
insolvency 
your credit file will reveal whether you have paid your bills 
on time if collection agencies were hired to dun you or if 
youve gone through bankruptcy bankcard holders of america a 
consumer group based in herndon va states in a pamphlet it 
publishes on understanding credit bureaus 
what the credit file usually wont include is salary 
information late payments within a 60day grace period or records 
on utility bills said mike van buskirk a vice president for trw 
information systems group which runs the nations largest credit 
bureau 
its a little like a library only it has the unusual problem 
of not having direct ability to validate the information van 
buskirk said if theres an error in the file most people wont 
find out about it until theyve suffered a damage or 
embarrassment 
consumer fear of reputationtainting information in a credit 
file especially at crucial times such as when applying for a 
mortgage has helped trw sell its credentials service to nearly 
750000 subscribers across the country 
lately the company has been advertising heavily with mission 
impossible star peter graves as spokesman in tv ads in large 
markets such as new york 
for a 35 annual fee credentials offers consumers unlimited 
access to their files notification whenever someone checks on 
them the release of credit data to authorized lenders and a 
creditcard registration service to protect against theft or loss 
in the process trw also collects extra financial information that 
may not included in the files it already has 
while some people describe the service as a convenience others 
call it a slick gimmick since all consumers are entitled under law 
to a copy of their credit file from a bureau for free or a nominal 
fee 
consumers also are entitled to receive from any credit bureau 
the identities of those who have sought their file although in 
most cases theyll already know an inquiry is imminent since 
federal law strictly limits access to credit files to anyone other 
than lenders to whom youve applied for credit 
if youre a busy executive and youre buying a home a boat a 
car and applying for a person loan all in one year credentials 
would be a good deal said elgie holstein executive director of 
bankcard holders of america but its unlikely most consumers 
would have the need to apply for major credit loans enough times in 
the course of the year to make this worthwhile 
morton agreed its a service thats little if any value for 
the consumer but a high value for trw consumers are paying to give 
trw more information 
morton recommends that average consumers check their credit 
report for accuracy at least once a year 
to do that consumers must write to a major credit bureau in 
their area which may be appear under credit bureaus or 
creditreporting agencies in the telephone directory besides trw 
the big bureaus are trans union credit information csc credit 
services inc and credit bureau inc csc and cbi recently agreed to 
merge their data services although they operate separately

the fair credit reporting act enacted in 1971 gives americans

whatever information they believe to be inaccurate 
if youre denied credit youre entitled to know whats in your 
file within 30 days of receiving a rejection letter that notice 
will contain the name and location of the creditreporting bureau

corn and soybean prices rose in the wake of the six to 10day 
forecast released wednesday by the national weather service it 
calls for belownormal rain and abovenormal temperatures in much

perfect growing conditions prices at these levels arent 
justified

the federal government will require automakers to 
boost their fleets average fuel economy for 1990 cars a move 
praised by a consumer advocate as a clear break from the reagan 
administration 
an analyst however said the plan will have a minimal effect on 
us gasoline consumption and general motors corp said it could 
result in job cuts 
manufacturers must improve overall fuel economy by 1 mile per 
gallon over 1989 models to 275 mpg transportation secretary 
samuel skinner announced wednesday 
im hopeful this will be an incentive to carmakers to 
explore better ways to develop better engines and get better 
mileage skinner told reporters 
weve got to get beyond where we are today in miles per 
gallon if were going to deal with this energy crisis 
skinner said the united states is importing more than 8 million 
barrels of oil a day for the first time since the 1970s 
congress in 1975 gave the transportation department authority to 
set the fuel economy standards for passenger cars sold in the 
united states the standard known as the corporate average fuel 
economy is measured over an automakers entire fleet 
the energy problem is such that every bit helps said con 
hitchcock a lawyer for public citizen a washington dcbased 
consumer group founded by ralph nader the automobile is the 
single largest user of petroleum and any saving will be helpful 
hitchcock noting that the us government had lowered the 
standard to 26 mpg for 198688 models lauded the higher standard 
it is a clear break with the reagan administration policy 
he said this is a sign that the bush administration is more 
concerned about energy and the environment than its predecessor 
was 
but david cole director of the university of michigans office 
of study of auto transportation said the new standard will not 
make much of a difference in overall us fuel consumption or have 
a big effect on car prices 
from a consumers standpoint its probably not going to make 
that much difference cole said in a telephone interview in 
terms of the industry meeting the 275 its real doable because 
theyre real close already 
william noack a gm spokesman in washington said the new 
standard could endanger us jobs by restricting the number of 
familysize americanmade cars 
today americans want larger familysize vehicles and if we 
are restrained from competing with foreign manufacturers for those 
sales the effect will be a loss of american jobs and no energy 
savings for the country noack said 
though foreignmade cars sold in the united states are governed 
by the standard most foreign manufacturers have built up credits 
under the program by marketing highly fuelefficient cars in past 
years and can now sell bigger cars without penalty he said 
hitchcock said the car companies have been making that same 
tired argument since 1974 without it really coming true 
theres no evidence weve seen that the standard has driven 
prices of us cars up he said 
spokesmen for all three us automakers said the companies would 
comply with the standard 
skinner in chicago as part of national transportation week 
observances said he could not estimate how much fuel will be saved 
under the new rules

depend on the timing of the selection of a successor 
ruder assured the president that he will continue to perform his 
duties actively until his return to northwestern and will work with 
the administration to secure a smooth transition 
ruder a nominee of former president reagan was appointed to 
the commission in august 1987 for a fiveyear term

japan may react strongly if the us government 
lists it among countries deemed to seriously violate free trade 
principles a foreign ministry official said thursday 
under us trade law the bush administration must decide by may 
30 which countries maintain high trade barriers to us products 
japan topped a preliminary list released last month by us trade 
representative carla hills of 34 countries deemed to have such 
barriers 
this is a matter that has already created quite a reaction in 
this country foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told a 
regular press briefing 
if japan is listed as a serious free trade violator he said 
the reaction could be rather emotional 
the new york times reported from washington earlier this week 
that the american embassy in tokyo had recommended that the us 
government use restraint in pressuring japan to eliminate trade 
barriers 
it quoted secret embassy cables as warning there might be an 
emotional outburst in japan if the country is included in the 
list of most serious free trade violators 
many japanese feel their country has done a great deal in recent 
years to open its markets to foreign products and that the united 
states has not tried hard enough to sell highquality products in 
japan or to reduce its massive government budget deficit 
some japanese officials also were embittered by the us 
handling of a recent agreement to jointly produce japans next jet 
fighter us congressmen demanded a renegotiation of the pact and 
contended japan was using it to acquire us technology even 
though japan had hoped to develop the plane alone 
the foreign ministry spokesman said japan might retaliate if the 
united states violated international trade regulations in 
attempting to reduce its trade imbalance with japan 
if there is any action taken on the part of the united states 
in violation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade we have 
to think of what we should do in response watanabe said 
according to figures released wednesday by the us commerce 
department japan accounted for 67 percent of the us trade 
deficit in march up from 53 percent in february many observers 
say japan is likely to be included in the hit list of serious 
freetrade violators because of its large portion of the trade 
deficit 
other asian nations including south korea and taiwan were 
included in the preliminary listing of alleged unfair traders and 
have been lobbying in washington to avoid being included in the 
upcoming list workers and farmers in south korea have demonstrated 
against the us trade pressure 
under us trade law nations on the final list will be targeted 
for intensive negotiations aimed at removal of alleged trade 
barriers if the barriers continue the law provides for 
retaliation including duties of up to 100 percent on imports from 
those nations 
watanabe said all of the charges against japan in the trade 
representatives report were based on erroneous understandings or 
simply not based on facts 
he said the united states would realize there is no foundation 
for putting those items as candidates on the list if it 
investigates the charges further 
us officials acknowledge that japan has one of the lowest 
average tariff rates in the world but say cultural and other 
factors make it difficult to sell here 
last year the united states had a 52 billion trade deficit 
with japan according to us figures

reality is elusive in economics where fads come 
and go where strawmen are created so they can be cut down and 
where myths sometimes serve as well as facts especially in popular 
interpretations 
it is a myth for example that japan is the biggest investor in 
the united states and it will remain a myth until japan overtakes 
the united kingdom and the netherlands and by then it could be 
overtaken by canada 
myths persist for many reasons one being that myths lend 
themselves to dramatic tales and because they have at least the 
ring of truth some vested interests seize them and use them for 
their private propoganda purposes 
but no the japanese arent the biggest buyers of us assets 
it might appear to be so because they increased their direct 
investments sharply from 47 billion in 1980 to 334 billion in 
1987 
with less public concern however europeans and canadians have 
long invested heavily in the united states in 1987 the united 
kingdom owned 749 billion of us assets the netherlands 47 
billion and canada 217 billion 
why the concern about the japanese the speed perhaps but the 
increase in japanese investments may not be maintained do you 
recall in the 1970s when the oilrich arabs were said to be buying 
up america 
it is because of such misconceptions that the washingtonbased 
citizens for a sound economy foundation has issued another in its 
series of myth booklets this one written by its own economist 
michael becker a doctoral student 
recognizing the low level of economic literacy the foundation 
states its position clearly it is it says a nonpartisan research 
and education organization its goal is to educate policymakers 
the media and citizens 
among myths it seeks to disprove is the one about foreigners 
buying up america well they are you say well theyre not says 
becker the fact he says is that foreignowned assets are a very 
small percentage of us assets 
despite the recent influx of foreign capital becker claims that 
foreign investors own only 4 percent to 5 percent of us physical 
assets 
well you say theyve been snapping up american farmland and 
if theyre getting our farmland then theyre increasing their 
control over our food prices and food makes up a very large part 
of our consumer price index 
no says becker they are not snapping up farmland its a myth 
he says they own negligible amounts of farmland by his 
estimates less than 1 percent 
the confusion he suggests might arise from the nomenclature 
because timber land is sometimes classified as farmland it isnt 
of course but mythologists sometimes fail to observe such 
distinctions 
as a result becker points out maine the pine tree state has 
the highest percentage 7 percent of foreignowned 
agricultural land maine says becker is hardly located in 
the breadbasket of america 
becker also tackles the notion that the united states is the 
worlds largest debtor nation a red light flashes before his 
eyes why he says it isnt even clear that the united states is a 
debtor nation at all 
he doesnt denounce the notion altogether but he does offer 
this explanation among others for his doubts 
the commerce department values direct investments at the 
amounts paid at purchase these amounts are not updated to account 
for growth or inflation many us investements abroad we made way 
back in the 1950s and 1960s 
foreign investments in the united states are of more recent 
vintage their dollar figures are more likely to reflect current 
values 
while commerce department figures on direct investments and 
stocks show the united states was a net debtor by 549 billion in 
1986 becker reminds us that market conditions have pushed up us 
assets abroad 
he asserts that by adjusting the figures to 1986 market value 
the united states was actually a net creditor by 296 billion

the house broke a partisan gridlock today and 
approved a measure providing 12 billion for veterans benefits 
money that lawmakers felt they had to provide with the approach of 
the memorial day recess 
the legislation was approved on a voice vote following hours of 
conferences among congressional leaders final legislative approval 
by the senate was possible later in the day 
the veterans funds to be spent in the current fiscal year had 
been part of a larger measure that had become bogged down because 
of a fight over 822 million it contained for antidrug programs 
democrats argued the money was needed for one of the nations worst 
problems but republicans insisted the extra money could wait until 
next year 
late wednesday it appeared that the dispute over the drug 
financing had ended all hopes of finishing work on the bill until 
the memorial day recess ends on may 31 
but both parties finally agreed to break the veterans funds out 
of the bill and leave the rest of it for the future memorial day 
recess when lawmakers traditionally give speeches to veterans 
groups begins this weekend for the senate and next week for the 
house 
we do realize other things are controversial said rep 
jamie whitten dmiss chairman of the house appropriations 
committee 
meanwhile senate approval was all that was needed for final 
adoption of a 117 trillion federal budget for 1990 whose 
defenders point not to what it does now but to what it avoids and 
what it portends 
the house passed the spending plan on wednesday by a 241185 
margin with a majority of democrats and republicans voting in 
support the senate planned to approve the measure today 
the bipartisan endorsement was predictable because the package 
reflects a 28 billion deficitreduction deal the bush 
administration and congressional leaders reached last month 
but though support was wide it was not deep critics have said 
the budgets claim to cut the deficit to 997 billion is based on 
rosy economic assumptions that make the shortfall appear less 
serious gimmicks like moving the moneylosing postal service off 
budget and onetime infusions of money from auctioning federal 
loan portfolios 
one lawmaker rep frederick upton rmich referred to the 
plan as a silhouette in silliness 
but defenders argued that the package avoids legislative 
gridlock between president bush and his no new taxes pledge and 
the democrats who control congress and their reluctance to slash 
domestic programs 
they also said it lays groundwork for legislativeexecutive 
cooperation for fiscal 1991 when the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law requires a shortfall of no more than 64 
billion 
the choice here is whether we take a first step or no step at 
all said house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
on the spending side the plan bolsters domestic spending at the 
expense of the pentagon defense spending would increase to 2992 
billion 42 billion short of what would be needed to counter the 
costs of inflation 
domestic programs as a whole would be allowed to grow by about 
4 billion above the rate of inflation 
education space science law enforcement health and 
lowincome assistance programs would be given enough money to 
expand over last year growth would be restrained for energy 
environment transportation agriculture and commerce initiatives 
foreign aid programs would reach 167 billion enough to hold 
even with inflation 
the package assumes federal military and civilian workers would 
receive 36 percent pay raises annual costofliving increases for 
recipients of social security and other incomesupport programs 
would be granted in full 
to find savings the plan would pare medicare growth by 23 
billion an amount expected to come from reducing payments to 
hospitals and doctors changes worth 11 billion would have to be 
made in federal pension programs and a change in the way the 
department of veterans affairs sells housing loans would raise 496 
million 
credit would be taken for 850 million in savings by shifting 
some agriculture payments from 1990 to this year and 477 million 
would be saved by taking credit for unused food stamps 
many of the savings called for in the plan are likely to trigger 
congressional battles over the coming months for example the 
budget calls for 53 billion in new tax receipts but the nature 
of those levies is expected to prompt prolonged fencing between 
bush and the democrats in congress 
the budget says the government would pocket 57 billion by 
selling assets such as loan portfolios and 27 billion by raising 
fees for certain federal services but again lawmakers must yet 
thrash out which assets and fees would be affected and there is a 
chance that stalemate would mean the savings would not occur 
the budget does not require the presidents signature congress 
uses it as a guide when passing future spending and taxing bills 
for the fiscal year starting oct 1

when housing starts begin to fall recession 
fears rise 
the relationship might be less now than it used to be but a 
decline in housing has preceded and accompanied most recessions in 
recent years and that makes housing a very sensitive economic 
barometer 
there are good reasons for following that barometer because as 
housing people point out the building of just one singlefamily 
house generates 18 workeryears of employment in construction or 
constructionrelated industries 
understandably houses are built by crews rather than 18 
workers but it averages out to that stated a bit differently one 
house provides 18 jobs of 40 hours a week for one full year and 
twothirds of another year 
the national association of home builders which makes that 
estimate from government figures strives to show that housing is 
good not only for them but good for the country not only good for 
builders but for other trades too 
working from official government figures the nahb estimates 
that 1000 singlefamily homes generate 393 million in wages and 
161 million in combined federal state and local taxes 
those amounts are just for singlefamily houses add in 
multifamily housing and the impact of 1000 units comes to 882 
workeryears 19 million in wages and 78 million in combined 
federal state and local revenues 
when you consider that there are more than a million housing 
starts each year more than 2 million in 1978 and probably 14 
million this year the impact grows to enormous proportions 
from 1983 through 1987 home builders say they built 86 million 
units creating 25 million fulltime jobs and generating 55 
billion in wages each year and a fiveyear total of 113 billion in 
tax revenues 
the impact even goes further who needs to be reminded that when 
a house is purchased a series of bigticket items are sure to 
follow including furniture appliances fuel contracts lawn 
mowers and more 
no wonder that housing construction is an economic barometer no 
wonder that when the barometer falls it sends a warning about the 
economys direction as surely as its meteorological counterpart 
signals inclement weather 
housing construction has fallen for three straight months 
enough to spur members of the nahb to pay a visit this week to alan 
greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board their message 
ease up 
what builders fear and many professional economists too is 
that any further increase in interest rates could pitch the economy 
into a recession before the year is out heed our barometer they 
said 
conceivably greenspan already had taken notice after about 14 
months of fighting inflation via higher interest rates the fed 
seems to have let up if only for an assessment in fact home 
mortgage rates have been falling 
a decline in mortgage rates coming as it does at the height of 
the buying season could pump some energy into the industry 
especially into the singlefamily home market that market already 
has shown renewed signs of life 
it is the multimarket category of housing that shows the 
greatest weakness and that weakness is generally attributed to the 
elimination or reduction of tax incentives such as accelerated 
depreciation 
recession the housing barometer hasnt yet made that 
declaration 
what is has indicated is that some stormy weather lurks not far 
away and that we should be mindful lest it come our way another 
monthly decline in housing the barometer says and it might

demonstrators assembled peacefully today 
at exxon corps annual shareholders meeting carrying protest 
signs and accusing the company of lying about its disastrous 
alaskan oil spill 
more than three dozen police officers watched as about 250 
demonstrators lined the entranceway to the aspen manor hotel in 
this suburban community 35 miles west of exxons corporate 
headquarters in new york city 
speaker barry commoner a former presidential candidate and 
longtime ecologist said the spill in alaskas prince william 
sound points out the united states overreliance on fossil fuels 
we are here to pass judgment on a crime against nature and the 
american people commoner told the crowd that is the only 
adequate description for what exxon has done in alaska 
consumer activists and leaders of national and state 
environmental groups also planned to address the crowd which 
assembled peacefully outside the hotel and displayed signs that 
read overthrow exxon and clean up your entire mess as 
stockholders arrived 
isabel byrd of trenton was dressed in an overstuffed tuxedo 
wore a pigs nose and walked on stilts she identified herself as a 
pig from exxon and said her outfit represented the companys 
corporate mentality 
we just came to say we dont have to care because were 
exxon said ms byrd were greedy and were pigs 
steve kosnac of somerville said he had worked on laying alaska 
pipeline during the 1970s he accused exxon of deliberately 
spilling the oil that poured from the grounded tanker exxon valdez 
on march 24 in alaskas prince william sound saying that spoiling 
the areas coastline would render it useless for anything but oil 
exploration 
oil companies are oil companies kosnac said theyre big 
money and theyd walk through your property and just fight you in 
court at a later date 
weldon monsport of boonton carried a sign that said exxon pr 
is more viscous goo on the truth he said he blamed exxon the 
people of alaska who bought the safety of oil exploration hook 
line and sinker and the federal government for the pollution 
along the alaskan coastline 
exxon has lied from the start and the government has dragged 
their feet and knuckles said monsport

company documents describe the former 
captain of the exxon valdez as an intelligent skilled seaman who 
failed to live up to his potential and suffered from depression and 
alcoholism 
the previously confidential documents were released wednesday 
during hearings into the march 24 tanker accident in which nearly 
11 million gallons of crude oil spilled into prince william sound 
the third days testimony before a national transportation 
safety board panel opened today with second officer lloyd lecain 
jr who was asleep when the wreck occurred he was questioned 
about the ships navigational equipment 
lecain said the wheel would not change the ships course if 
turned while the vessel was on autopilot and no alarm would sound 
third mate gregory cousins who was in charge on the bridge when 
the tanker ran aground had testified this week that he set off the 
autopilot about 12 minutes before the wreck but the ship did not 
respond to his course changes 
earlier during the second day of the fiveday hearings the 
ntsb panel heard testimony that 
capt joseph hazelwoods bloodalcohol content may have been 
more than five times the legal limit when the tanker ran aground 
and bottles of lowalcohol beer were found in his cabin shortly 
after the accident 
the chief mate feared for his life when he discovered how much 
oil was gushing into the water he said hazelwood told him well 
this is one way to end a career 
coast guard radar failed to identify the tankers position in 
the minutes before the wreck and may have been out of calibration 
an exxon shipping co disability report dated may 14 1985 
details the reasons for hazelwoods admission to a hospital for 
alcohol treatment a doctor wrote that hazelwood then 38 had been 
drinking excessively causing problems at home and work 
the doctor described hazelwood as depressed and demoralized 
and recommended a 28day treatment program the doctor concluded 
that hazelwood should take a leave of absense to get involved in 
alcoholics anonymous 
work evaluations from 1982 to 1987 describe hazelwood as getting 
along well with his crew and meeting the normal requirements of 
the position but lacked creativitity or interest in running a 
ship 
joe does not try to achieve the true potential his gifted 
intelligence warrants one supervisor wrote 
three of the four evaluations recommended at least temporary 
shore assignment but theres no indication company officials acted 
upon the suggestions 
the last evaluation in 1987 said hazelwood handles unusual 
situations well and rated him above average on decisionmaking 
ability a 1984 report ranked him high on safety consciousness 
in testimony wednesday toxicologist mike peat said hazelwoods 
bloodalcohol level would have been 022 percent when the vessel 
ran aground assuming he did not drink any alcoholic beverage from 
then until his blood was tested nearly 11 hours later 
peat director of a sacramento calif laboratory that tested 
hazelwoods blood and urine samples said the blood sample showed 
an alcohol level of 0061 percent 
the coast guard considers commercial vessel operators illegally 
intoxicated at 004 percent 
mark delozier chief warrant officer at the coast guard marine 
safety office in valdez was the third witness to testify that he 
had smelled alcohol on hazelwoods breath 
i would describe it as very intense delozier said it 
smelled like someone who had been sitting in a bar drinking for 
quite some time 
delozier and lt cmdr thomas falkenstein were among the first 
officials to board the ship after it ran aground falkenstein also 
said he smelled alcohol on the captains breath 
delozier said hazelwood tried to mask his breath by placing his 
hand over his mouth drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette which 
the coast guardsman asked him to extinguish because of the volatile 
oil fumes 
like previous witnesses delozier and falkenstein said hazelwood 
did not appear drunk but peat said thats not unusual for someone 
with a history of alcoholism even at 022 percent a persons 
judgment and vision would be impaired regardless of physical 
appearance he said 
hazelwood has pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges of 
operating a vessel while drunk and has declined to testify at the 
ntsb hearings 
the vessels chief mate james r kunkel said he grabbed his 
survival suit and thought he would die after the ship ran aground 
i dont mind telling you that at the time i knew that my 
world would never be the same again kunkel said i never knew 
if id see my wife again 
he said he considered wearing a respirator after the odor of 
crude oil filled the ships passageways 
im walking around wondering if im going to see the 
sunrise he recalled 
the two ship traffic monitors testified that the exxon valdez 
only showed up sporadically on radar after it left valdez narrows 
gordon taylor testified that ships appeared and disappeared on 
the radar possibly because of a tuning problem with the 
equipment 
the ship radioed to the coast guard traffic center in valdez 
that it was going outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid ice 
but it never radioed back to say it was changing course again to 
avoid bligh reef 
taylor said he lost sight of the tanker on radar and had no

the bush administration today renewed its 
strong opposition to senatepassed restrictions on the 6 billion 
fsx fighter jet del with secretary of state james a baker iii 
saying they would put the entire warplane agreement with japan at 
risk 
in a letter to the house foreign affairs committee baker urged 
the panel not to adopt the senate legislation sponsored by sen 
robert c byrd dwva baker said the byrd resolution 
establishes an unacceptable precedent infringing on the 
presidents constitutional authority with respect to the conduct of 
negotiations with foreign powers 
he added the conditions stated in the resolution would put 
the entire fsx program and our agreement with japan at risk 
house critics of the fsx deal initially had planned to go before 
the foreign affairs committee today to urge adoption of the 
restrictions embodied in the byrd resolution but the panel instead 
heard from several administration officials who underscored the 
opposition stated in bakers letter committee action on the 
resolution was postponed until next tuesday 
byrds measure directs the white house to bar the transfer of 
sophisticated jet engine technology to japan and to guarantee that 
american companies will get at least 40 percent of the work on the 
fsx an advanced version of the us f16 fighter 
earlier the white house had said it has grave concerns that 
the byrd amendment could erode presidential authority the state 
department said the provision could force renegotiation of the 
agreement with the japanese government 
the senate voted by a 5247 margin tuesday to defeat a 
resolution that would have scrapped the fsx deal but it then voted 
7227 to adopt byrds restrictions 
general dynamics is to join with japans mitsubishi heavy 
industries to codevelop and coproduce the nextgeneration fighter 
for deployment by japan in the late 1990s general dynamics has 
headquarters in st louis but most of the fsx work would be done 
at its f16 plant in fort worth texas 
in the house rep richard gephardt dmo who campaigned for 
the democratic presidential nomination last year on a platform 
urging retaliation against unfair trade practices by japan said it 
is essential that congress adopt the amendment because we dont 
want some vague promise that doesnt get fulfilled 
rep mel levine dcalif another outspoken opponent of the 
fsx declared that it is important to hold the administrations 
feet to the fire were saying that when you negotiate a deal 
demonstrate that we are really going to get the 40 percent you were 
talking about 
the senate passed the byrd amendment by a margin that would 
override a presidential veto and levine said there is a good chance 
the house can follow suit 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif said the byrd amendment was a 
classic example of micromanagement by congress he described it 
as a sourgrape amendment by those who lost the vote against fsx 
in the senate 
however rep helen delich bentley rmd predicted that a 
number of republicans would join the houses democratic majority in 
supporting the restrictions 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush 
told house republicans his administration would work against the 
byrd amendment when the measure gets to a housesenate conference 
committee to resolve differences between the measures passed by the 
two chambers 
fitzwater said bush was concerned about the amendment because 
it creates a system of congressional approval over these kinds of 
projects that we consider to be erosive of presidential power 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois said bush had 
asked republicans to support him on the fsx even though they face 
opposing pressure from back home

burger kings new management moved thursday to turn 
around years of erratic advertising results by selecting two new 
agencies to handle the major portion of its 215 million 
advertising and marketing account 
this is a nontraditional approach but for us it is far more 
important to be right rather than conventional said barry j 
gibbons burger king corps chief executive 
darcy masius benton amp bowles of new york will concentrate on 
reinforcing brand identity while saatchi amp saatchi advertising of 
new york will concentrate on daytoday brand retailing burger 
king said 
the agencies replace nw ayer the new yorkbased ad agency 
hired 20 months ago that created the we do it like youd do it 
theme burger king began using in january 1988 
the britishbased conglomerate grand metropolitan plc acquired 
burger king as part of its buyout of the pillsbury co based in 
minneapolis in january the miamibased burger king is a 
subsidiary of pillsbury 
burger king which had systemwide sales of 54 billion in 5800 
restaurants during fiscal year 1988 has had little or no sales 
growth over the past four years although it has held on to its 
secondplace position in the fastfood market behind industry 
leader mcdonalds corp 
average sales per restaurant slipped 1 percent last year but 
finished above 1 million for the fourth consecutive year burger 
king said 
the company estimates its market share has held fairly steady 
over that period at about 17 percent 
gary l langstaff hired in april as burger kings executive 
vice president of marketing after three years with hardees said 
the dualagency approach is part of an overall effort to improve 
the focus of burger king advertising 
there are two keys for us daytoday and longterm branding 
our goal is to make both of those work in tandem langstaff said 
he said no decision had been made yet on how ad spending would 
be split between the two new agencies he also declined to estimate 
when advertising from the new agencies may start running 
langstaff said burger king will continue to work on a 
projectbyproject basis with both its national promotion agencies 
einsonfreeman inc and august bishop and meier burger kings 
relationships are unchanged with other advertising agencies 
uniworld group inc and castor spanish international uniworld and 
castor create ads for burger king aimed at minority markets 
burger king disclosed last month that it planned to replace ayer 
on the national portion of its advertising business but said ayer 
would continue to produce regional advertising 
with thursdays announcement burger king indicated it would 
sever all ties with ayer after a brief transition period 
ayer was selected in september 1987 as burger kings ad agency 
ending the fastfood companys 11year association with j walter 
thompson of new york 
thompsons work for burger king included a roundly criticized 
1986 campaign that featured a search for the nerdy herb who had 
never been to a burger king 
subsequent campaigns from thompson that used the themes this 
is a burger king town and the best food for fast times failed 
to spark sales 
but ayers we do it campaign also failed to boost sales 
burger king also underwent a series of unsettling management 
changes during ayers tenure 
it has been said many times that timing is everything jerry 
siano the head of ayer said thursday in a memo to his employees 
we were a year and a half early 
he said grand met has indicated a commitment to management 
stability and marketing focus that will become the vital 
ingredients to burger kings future success we wish them much 
success 
a jubilant edward j wax chief executive officer of saatchi amp 
saatchi said he and other executives would travel soon to miami to 
begin defining roles and working up strategies 
obviously we think theyre a tremendous company wax said 
from new york theres a lot to be done theres been a lot of 
negative stuff written its a big challenge but were excited 
wax called the twoagency approach fascinating and innovative 
and said his earlier study of burger king found strong management 
commitment to improvement 
his agency in the past has handled assignments for the fast food 
operators krystal wendys and arbys wax said and experienced 
executives from those accounts will work on burger king

to expected dry conditions next week 
corn and soybean futures rose following word that the national 
weather services six to 10day forecast released wednesday calls

failure by the united states and the 
european community to fashion an agricultural reform plan could 
lead to serious trade disputes the departing us ambassador to 
the trading bloc warned thursday 
if the movement to reform worldwide agriculture fails then we 
could have in my judgment around the world a real trade war 
said alfred h kingon the us representative to the 12nation 
common market 
kingon who leaves his post june 3 after more than two years 
told reporters he generally was optimistic about trade relations 
between the united states and the common market 
there has been an effort especially in the last 12 months to 
try to put the tiffs that we haveinto some kind of 
perspectiveand not let them unhinge the whole relationship 
he said 
kingon noted however that the two sides have not settled a 
fight over a european ban on imports of american beef from cattle 
treated with growth hormones they also are at odds over government 
support for airbus industrie a fournation european aircraft 
building consortium that competes with boeing co and mcdonnell 
douglas corp 
but he said the most troublesome dispute concerned efforts to 
reach agreement on the politically sensitive issue of government 
subsidies to farmers 
the united states the common market and other countries are 
tackling agricultural policies as part of international trade talks 
held under the auspices of the 96nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade gatt is a forum and an agreement for removing 
trade barriers 
kingon said that if the united states and the common market do 
not resolve their differences then i must say im pessimistic 
about what will happen to the trade relations between the two 
groups 
the two sides agreed last month to freeze current farm support 
levels and reduce aid in 1990 the accord provides a framework for 
further discussions under the uruguay round of talks to liberalize 
global trade the round ends in 1990 
the united states wants the european community to end import 
barriers and export and domestic farm subsidies that it says 
distort trade 
kingon also predicted the european communitys openness to 
foreign goods after it becomes a single market in 1992 will depend 
on competition within the trade bloc and on world economic 
conditions 
once the barriers are dismantled he said european business 
executives will find their companies facing strong competition from 
other european concerns these tougher business conditions he 
said may take place during a period of economic recession 
the convergence of those two forces will put to the test the 
oftenstated wellintentioned expressionthat this will be an 
open market he said 
american and other foreign officials and business executives 
worry the europeans may use the single market to try to keep out 
us and other foreign competition 
the europeanwide market is intended reduce barriers that keep 
goods services people and money from moving freely among the 12 
countries

minorco sa said thursday it was appealing a us 
judges refusal to lift a preliminary injunction that scuttled its 
hostile 57 billion attempted takeover of consolidated gold fields 
plc 
the luxembourgbased south africancontrolled minorco said the 
appeal was filed wednesday to the us court of appeals for the 
second circuit 
the preliminary injunction blocked minorco from buying more than 
30 percent of the british gold mining giants shares 
minorco owns 299 percent of the shares and had received 
acceptances for its takeover offer that would have taken its 
holding to 55 percent a merger of the two companies would have 
created the noncommunist worlds largest gold producing concern 
repeated attempts by minorco to have the injunction lifted were 
denied by judge michael mukasey of the us district court for the 
southern district of new york 
the offer expired wednesday under british takeover regulations 
and minorco must wait a year before it can make another bid for 
gold fields if it wants to however if another suitor makes a bid 
for gold fields minorco can make a competing offer 
the suit that resulted in the injunction was brought by gold 
fields and by its 49percent owned subsidiary newmont mining corp 
gold fields later withdrew from the action leaving just newmont to 
pursue the case 
minorco said it is defending itself against newmonts lawsuit 
further action in the us courts including the appeal doesnt 
suggest any decision has been taken regarding its pursuit of gold 
fields the company said 
minorcos continued efforts to overturn the us court 
injunction could be an attempt to clear up any antitrust concerns 
in the united states in case the company decides to seek future 
expansion in the us natural resource sector 
minorco is 391 percent owned by anglo american corp and 21 
percent owned by de beers consolidated mines ltd which are 
respectively the gold and diamond mining interests of south 
african oppenheimer family

singing what do you do with a drunken 
sailor make him skipper of an exxon tanker more than 250 
demonstrators protested outside the oil companys annual 
shareholder meeting thursday 
demonstrators wearing costumes and holding signs reading 
overthrow exxon and clean up your entire mess lined the 
entranceway as exxon corp stockholders arrived for the meeting at 
the aspen manor hotel where about 80 police officers corralled 
protesters in a parking lot 
protesters acted peacefully but spoke angrily about the march 24 
spill of millions of gallons of crude oil from the tanker exxon 
valdez into alaskas prince william sound the nations worst oil 
spill ever 
our environment is going to hell in a bucket said rae 
mclaughlin a 30yearold office manager and member of new jersey 
citizen action one of the environmental groups sponsoring the 
protest theyre not even attempting to clean it up 
she and many others blamed exxon for hiring joseph hazelwood 
captain of the exxon valdez the coast guard has said hazelwood 
tested above the legal limit for alcohol nine hours after the 
accident but hazelwood has pleaded innocent to charges of 
operating a vessel while drunk 
the whole thing was ridiculous ms mclaughlin said there 
was no reason to have a drunk person at the helm 
five demonstrators perched on stilts wore pig tails and pig 
noses to complement their overstuffed tuxedos and briefcases 
festooned with exxon stickers and bulging with fake money 
we just came to say we dont have to care because were 
exxon said isabel byrd a 51yearold theater worker from 
trenton who identified herself as a pig from exxon 
one speakers addressing the crowd many of whom wore black arm 
bands and waved rags saying clean energy now was barry 
commoner the environmentalist and former presidential candidate 
from the citizens party 
he and other protesters said the spill points out the oil 
industrys failure to prepare for such disasters the united 
states overreliance on fossil fuels and a need to convert to solar 
energy 
commoner also drew cheers from the crowd which basked in sunny 
80degree weather when he laughed at exxons proposal to add an 
environmentalist to its board of directors 
if the dying sea otters could talk if the american people 
aghast at the criminal incompetence of the exxon management could 
be heard if justice is to be done the proper punishment is not 
adding one environmentalist to the board of directors commoner 
said the proper punishment is to replace every one of them 
steve kosnac a 63yearold retiree from somerville who said he 
helped lay the alaska pipeline during the 1970s accused exxon of 
deliberately spilling the oil spoiling the coastline of prince 
william sound would render it useless for anything but oil 
exploration he said 
oil companies are oil companies kosnac said theyre big 
money and theyd walk through your property and just fight you in 
court at a later date 
others said the time had passed to lay blame and hoped the 
disaster would spur congress to pass legislation halting oil 
exploration in the alaskan wildlife refuge 
township mayor frank priore said his sympathies lay with the 
protesters and that he would ask exxon to pay the police overtime 
costs which he estimated between 12000 and 18000

chrysler corp said thursday it has agreed to 
acquire thriftyrentacar systems inc for 263 million becoming 
the last of the big three automakers to take a stake in the rental 
car business 
the agreement announced by chrysler chairman lee iacocca during 
the companys annual meeting in san francisco calls for chrysler 
to pay 2775 a share for all of the tulsa oklabased thriftys 
stock 
thriftys five major shareholders have granted options to 
chrysler for acquisition of 54 percent of the outstanding shares 
the news sent thriftys stock price up 925 a share to 2725 
in national overthecounter trading in trading on the new york 
stock exchange chrysler rose 37 cents a share to 2475 
ford motor co has interests in hertz corp and budget rent a 
car corp and general motors corp owns part of national car 
rental 
iacocca called thrifty the fifthlargest car rental company in 
north america a solid player in the car rental business 
thriftys management would remain in place 
we are delighted with the prospect of joining forces with 
chrysler said thrifty chairman william e lobeck jr our board 
of directors recommends unanimously that stockholders tender their 
shares 
chrysler is epected to make a tender offer starting by wednesday 
for thrifty stock chrysler supplies 75 percent to 80 percent of 
the cars in thriftys fleet 
the rental car business is appealing to the automakers for 
several reasons 
rental cars make up a substantial portion of each automakers 
fleet sales they also provide added exposure of the products away 
from the showroom that could turn into sales later 
on a smaller scale sales of cars to rental car companies can 
help inventories of some models and serve as a testing ground for 
new trim packages or options 
obviously its a defensive move to keep its access to fleet 
markets auto analyst ron glantz of montgomery securities inc of 
san francisco said of the chryslerthrifty deal but defensive 
moves dont necessarily make you money 
ford the nations no 2 automaker had held 55 percent of hertz 
corp the nations largest automobile renter in a deal announced 
earlier this month volvo north american corp acquired a portion 
of fords equity which would reduce fords ownership to 49 percent 
of hertzs stock 
in march a financing package was completed in which ford would 
provide 324 million for the acquisition of budget rent a car 
corp the thirdlargest car rental company in the nation by beech 
holdings corp fords equity in that deal involved nonvoting 
preferred shares of beech 
ford supplies about 70 percent of budgets cars and a majority 
of the 180000car fleet operated by hertz which refused to say 
exactly how many cars were ford products 
gm the nations largest automaker acquired a significant

exxon corp chairman lawrence g rawl 
rejected a call for his resignation thursday but assured company 
shareholders that he and other exxon management would be part of 
major policy changes at the company including random drug testing 
i want you to know theres going to be equity rawl told 
about 1700 exxon shareholders attending the first annual meeting 
since the march 24 spill by the tanker exxon valdez we will have 
random testing of our people and of senior management including 
me 
addressing stockholders at the start of the meeting rawl 
repeated his apologies for the disaster and pledged again to clean 
up the fouled waters and beaches in and around alaskas prince 
william sound 
rawl showed a brief film made by exxon about its cleanup efforts 
and later fielded shareholder questions for nearly four hours in 
what turned out to be a quieter meeting than company officials had 
anticipated 
dozens of local police and company security patrolled inside and 
outside the meeting hall bags were checked and people attending 
had to pass through metal detectors 
a crowd of orderly demonstrators carried signs and chanted 
slogans outside but were kept at least 50 yards from the entrance 
some sang what do you do with a drunken sailor make him skipper 
of an exxon tanker 
parsippany police and exxon officials estimated the crowd at 
about 150 while other estimates were as high as 250 exxon 
officials said they had expected at least 600 demonstrators 
five demonstrators perched on stilts wore pig tails and pig 
noses to complement their overstuffed tuxedos and briefcases 
festooned with exxon stickers and bulging with fake money 
we just came to say we dont have to care because were 
exxon said isabel byrd a 51yearold theater worker from 
trenton nj who identified herself as a pig from exxon 
inside ed rothschild director of the consumer group citizen 
action called on rawl to resign 
we think that the shareholders and the board need to have a 
new set of people to deal with these circumstances and to set the 
company on a new course said rothschild who owns one share of 
stock the question is will you resign and if not why not 
the answer is no i wont rawl replied to a chorus of boos 
mixed with applause rawl said the best thing exxon could do was 
abide by the promises the company has already made 
jay d hair president of the national wildlife federation and a 
wildlife biologist called on exxon to set up a multibilliondollar 
cleanup trust fund starting with 1 billion immediately and annual 
contributions of 1 billion a year thereafter 
rawl rejected that proposal last week saying the company has 
already committed to doing everything possible to clean up the 
spill 
hair representing holders of 48000 shares of exxon stock told 
exxon management that areas already designated as cleaned by exxon 
remain badly soiled 
its an absolute joke hair said of the cleanup you can 
pick up a rock and it drips oil 
robin dexter a commercial salmon fisherman whose livelihood has 
depended on the nowfouled alaska waters said he purchased 10 
shares of exxon stock just to be able to attend thursdays meeting 
my intention is to convince people in the fishing industry 
to accumulate shares so we can seriously put an issue before 
shareholders that will result in some changes dexter said later 
several large pension funds had threatened in the weeks leading 
up to the meeting to vote against management if it didnt 
demonstate its willingness to avert future spills 
in the final tally 9766 million shares or 778 percent were 
voted in favor of electing the current slate of directors 
exxon president lee raymond said the number of customers who had 
returned their exxon credit cards was up to 18000 out of a total 
of 7 million 
among the demands by the institutional shareholders were the 
appointment to the board of an environmental expert and the 
formation of a committee to review exxon policies on the 
environment and worker safety and health 
rawl who has agreed to both requests said the company was 
reviewing a list of candidates and that an environmentalist would 
begin serving on the board before next years shareholders meeting 
despite jibes and namecalling by dissident stockholders rawl 
told reporters afterward it wasnt as bad as he had expected 
rawl called the recommendations useful and fair 
i dont feel beat upon he said 
weve got to communicate better he said its incumbent 
on me to communicate better we have to keep working on this 
problem but were going to get our reputation back

farm debt fell for a fifth straight year 
in 1988 dropping nearly 3 percent from 1987 and down almost 28 
percent from its 1983 peak the federal reserve bank of chicago 
reports 
the report also says that while farm debt was shrinking the 
quality of farm loans still held by most lenders continued to 
improve and repayment rates remained high despite the drought of 
1988 
the chicago fed said total farm debt not counting price support 
loans from the commodity credit corp and consumer loans for farm 
households dropped to 1386 billion last year from 1427 billion 
in 1987 
about 77 billion was loaned to buy farmland and the remaining 
616 billion was to finance operating expenses or capital 
expenditures such as the purchase of machinery 
real estate debt was down 27 percent from its 1983 peak and 
nonreal estate debt was off 30 percent with each of those 
components retreating to 10year lows said a report by economist 
gary benjamin in the chicago feds agricultural letter publication 
at the same time the value of all farm assets rose almost 5 
percent last year to about 743 billion climbing about 75 percent 
above the 1986 low 
compared with the 1981 peak however the value of farm assets 
was still down by 25 percent economist peter heffernan said in a 
companion report 
heffernan said the overall reduction of farm debt combined with 
the continued growth of assets increased total net worth of farmers 
by 67 percent 
the current forecast of the farm sectors balance sheet at the 
end of this year points to continued improvement in the sectors 
financial condition heffernan wrote 
he said the value of farmland and other agricultural assets each 
are expected to continue to rise about 2 percent heffernan also 
said farm debt is expected to show its first yeartoyear rise 
since 1983 with forecasts indicating an increase of 2 percent to 3 
percent 
despite the expected increase in debt farm sector equity is 
projected to show a moderate increase in 1989 rising 1 to 2 
percent from last years level he said 
farm sector equity stood at 604 billion at the end of last 
year a gain of 13 percent from the 1986 low but after adjusting 
for inflation equity was little more than half the 1979 peak and 
in a range that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s heffernan wrote 
benjamin said banks held 307 percent of all farm debt last 
year up 4 percent from 1987 while debt held by the farm credit 
system continued a retreat 
the farm credit system which is recovering from the brink of 
collapse as a result of a congressional rescue accounted for 264 
percent of total farm debt in 1988 or 366 billion representing 
a drop of 28 billion in five years 
the farmers home administration accounted for 157 percent of 
total farm debt down 71 percent from 1987 life insurance 
companies held 65 percent of farm debt off 24 percent from the 
previous year and individuals and other sources accounted for the 
remaining 207 percent down 44 percent 
despite drought farm loan repayment rates remained at a high 
level in 1988 the report said supported by generous government 
payments to farmers and high prices for commodities

pilots union leaders at strikebound eastern 
airlines say 170 eastern pilots can go to work for the companys 
northeast shuttle if it is sold to developer donald trump 
reversing their earlier position that the pilots should not work 
for trump until the strike was over 
the pilots who already have been hired for the planned trump 
shuttle had said they planned to defy union leaderships earlier 
position 
trumps agreement to buy the business for 365 million from 
eastern parent texas air corp still must be approved by the 
federal bankruptcy court 
the master executive council of the air line pilots association 
at eastern had asked its pilots not to work for trump or receive 
further training for the trump shuttle as long as the strike 
against eastern continued 
after a meeting thursday with trump shuttle officials the 
pilots leadership decided prospective trump pilots would be 
approved to go ahead and start training said dan ashby a 
spokesman for alpa in new york 
in an earlier message to pilots jack bavis the head of the 
eastern pilots union had directed that no pilot including those 
who have accepted employment with the trump shuttle will engage in 
any training of any kind until the strike is over or until the 
master executive council endorses another course of action 
easterns unions have opposed a sale of the profitable new 
yorkwashingtonboston shuttle and other eastern assets 
the company has been in bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the start of a machinists 
union strike that was joined by easterns pilots and flight 
attendants unions and virtually grounded the airline 
in a letter dated may 2 to henry duffy national president of 
alpa pilot bill sanford said the trump pilots have to question 
whether the association is working toward our best interest at 
trump if the master executive council continues to interfere in 
our business and alpa continues to ignore us then a reassessment 
and further examination of our alternatives will obviously have to 
be explored 
in recent weeks other prospective trump pilots have sent a 
flurry of similar letters to trump duffy us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland who is overseeing easterns chapter 11 
proceeding copies of some of the letters were obtained by the 
associated press 
trump shuttle management already has signed labor agreements 
with pilots and flight attendants 
america west airlines which has made a competing higher offer 
for the shuttle has said it mainly would use its own employees to 
operate the service although eastern workers would be eligible to 
apply for jobs america west a regional carrier based in phoenix 
ariz is nonunion 
the company has offered to pay 415 million for the eastern 
shuttle and 336 million for 10 boeing 757s 
in addition to the 170 eastern pilots already hired another 40 
or so pilots have been hired for the trump shuttle from other 
carriers and elsewhere before the strike easterns shuttle was 
its only profitable operation since then it has been running 
nearly at full schedule but with skimpy passenger loads as many 
passengers have defected to pan am corps rival service 
eastern said earlier this week that its share of the shuttle 
market split with pan am has dropped to around 23 percent from 53 
percent in december of last year

central banks battered down the dollar thursday 
in a battle with currency dealers who had driven the currency 
sharply upward in recent weeks 
traders shrugged off the central bank dollar sales at first but 
the rally broke by latemorning trading in new york when the 
dollar hit its highest point in years against key currencies 
still the dollar finished the day less than half a percent 
below its levels of late wednesday indicating that traders 
remained willing to challenge the resolve of government bankers and 
finance officials 
we have a market that still wants to test the upside potential 
for the dollar said nicholas sargen a salomon brothers inc 
analyst 
he said estimates of the official dollar sales ranged from 15 
billion to 3 billion including heavy sales by the bank of japan 
during tokyo trading hours 
in precious metals trading gold plunged in late activity to 
levels not seen since august 1986 republic national bank of new 
york quoted gold at 36830 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt down 
from 37175 late wednesday 
the dollar peaked at 19880 west german marks and 13960 
japanese yen approaching what traders consider to psychologically 
important levels of 2 marks and 140 yen reaching those levels 
could incite further speculative buying dealers say 
analysts grasped for explanations for the dollars strength the 
biggest factor appeared to be momentum of the market itself which 
often moves independently of underlying economic factors 
a labor department inflation report was mildly positive for the 
dollar consumer prices rose 07 percent in april or 02 percent 
excluding food and energy the report slightly diminished 
expectations of an interestrate cut by the federal reserve which 
would make returns less attractive on dollardenominated 
investments 
also helping the dollar was word that the west german central 
bank had decided against raising interest rates to defend the mark 
several analysts said central banks would have a hard time 
depressing the dollar without interestrate increases in japan and 
west germany or rate cuts in the united states 
but many traders doubt how serious the federal reserve and 
treasury department are about restraining the dollar 
a strong dollar helps us policymakers fight inflation by 
holding down import prices and cooling off exports said raymond 
worseck an economist for ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
worseck said the dollar should remain strong indefinitely 
because global investors believe the united states is a good place 
for their investments 
but andrew f brimmer a former federal reserve governor said 
the dollar eventually will be dragged down by the huge us trade 
deficit which is funneling dollars overseas 
i am convinced that the dollar is responding to shortrun 
transitory factors and not to longrun factors said brimmer who 
runs a washingtonbased consulting firm brimmer amp co 
joining the federal reserve were the central banks of britain 
switzerland france belgium austria italy canada and japan 
dealers said the west german bundesbank was conspicuously absent 
they said 
in london the british pound rose to 16180 from 16140 late 
wednesday in new york sterling rose to 16175 from 16115 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins

south korea hoping to head off threatened 
us trade sanctions has reached agreement on a package of import 
liberalization measures sought by the bush administration 
officials announced thursday 
under the agreement to be signed next week south korea pledged 
to ease conditions on foreign investments and open its market to 
foreignowned travel and advertising agencies and wholesalers of 
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 
us trade representative carla hills praised the actions taken 
by south koreas negotiators but said the united states still 
intends to push for the removal of other trade barriers especially 
those affecting us agricultural products 
koreas marketopening measures will bring real and 
substantial benefits to american and other exporters and 
investors she said in a statement 
under the 1988 omnibus trade act hills must by may 28 decide 
whether to include south korea in a list of countries that are 
possible targets for us retaliation because it has erected unfair 
trade barriers against american products 
hills statement did not indicate whether south koreas action 
would be enough to keep it off the target list but south korean 
officials indicated that they hoped that would be the case 
chances are higher than a month ago that korea will be 
excluded from the list of target countries said kim chilsu 
assistant south korean trade minister 
in the agreement south korea said it would replace an advance 
approval requirement for foreign investment with simple 
notification rules phasing in the change from 1991 through 1993 
south korea also agreed to admit foreign travel agencies starting 
in january 1991 officials said 
ms hills said the agreements create a useful precedent for 
the current round of global trade liberalization negotiations which 
are scheduled to be completed in 1990 
but she said the united states remains committed to further 
marketing opening in korea especially in agriculture 
the korean side last month announced plans to remove or lower 
import barriers by 1991 on 243 farm and fishery products but in 
the latest round it rejected us demands for the opening of its 
market to nine more foodstuffs including oranges officials said

southmark corp scrambling to avoid default on 
11 billion in bonds on thursday postponed a special directors 
election a move criticized by dissident shareholders seeking three 
seats on the companys board 
dallasbased southmark which earlier this week announced a 
104 billion quarterly loss said it had decided to postpone the 
meeting scheduled for thursday until may 31 because of the 
enormous confusion created by herbert parks and his investor 
groups changing campaign to gain representation on the board of 
directors 
parks meanwhile called the postponement highhanded 
the board unilaterally postponed a meeting knowing full well 
that hundreds of shareholders from all over the united states had 
already made arrangements to attend he said 
unlike most proxy fights regulations governing some of 
southmarks subsidiaries prohibit any one person from casting 
proxies for more than 10 percent of a companys stock as a result 
most shareholders would have to attend the meeting in person in 
order to cast votes 
the meeting was scheduled to take place in atlanta where 
southmark traces its corporate roots to its beginnings as the real 
estate investment trust of citizens amp southern national bank the 
rescheduled meeting also is set for atlanta 
the announcement was made shortly after a federal judge in north 
carolina refused to stymie parks bid the federal home loan bank 
board had sought to block parks under regulations prohibiting a 
group from gaining control of a savings and loan association 
without federal permission 
one of southmarks key holdings is san jacinto savings and loan 
association in texas 
southmark chairman arthur g weiss who has headed the company 
after its two top officers were ousted in january said the recent 
court maneuverings and statements from parks have clouded the 
issues surrounding the special meeting 
we believe the shareholders deserve an opportunity to fully 
consider the significance of these recent developments affecting 
the solicitation by the parks group weiss said 
parks a greensboro nc real estate broker and developer 
first sought to replace all seven southmark directors with his own 
slate but was forced to scale that back to three because of the 
federal regulations regarding change in control of financial 
institutions 
nevertheless the fhlbb still sought to block the election 
claiming the three directors would give the parks group effective 
control of the company 
parks who owns about 45 percent of southmarks common stock 
undertook his fight for control after complaining that weiss was 
in way over his head in attempts to turn around the company 
which was hit hard by the real estate depression in texas 
on tuesday southmark reported a 104 billion loss for the 
quarter ended march 31 mainly because of an 829 million reserve 
for losses in its battered real estate holdings 
the loss reduced the companys net worth to a negative 428 
million putting the company in technical default on about 11 
billion in mainly junk bonds raised through drexel burnham lambert 
inc 
southmark said it could continue to pay its creditors including 
bondholders who nevertheless could begin steps to force the company 
into bankruptcy

an exxon executive told federal investigators 
thursday that the company has enforced a strict policy against 
alcohol and drug violations on its oil tankers by firing 34 people 
over the past five years 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi also said that exxon 
has spent more than 92 million on the cleanup of the nations 
worst oil spill caused by its tanker exxon valdez hitting a reef 
on march 24 
in a hearing before a national transportation safety board 
panel iarossi said exxon ships go through rigorous alcohol and 
drug searches involving dogs trained searchers and occasionally 
us customs service agents in the past 6 years there have been 
30 searches he said that comes out to searches of five ships a 
year in the 16ship fleet he said 
iarossi said the companys alcohol and drug policy produced 55 
disciplinary cases among its tanker crews over five years 
including the 34 firings five of those cases were appealed by 
unions and all five were overturned by arbitrators who found the 
policy too severe he said 
the policy has come under scrutiny because the exxon valdez was 
under the command of a captain with a history of alcohol abuse who 
lost his drivers license in his home state of new york for drunken 
driving 
capt joseph hazelwood was fired after he was accused of 
operating the ship while intoxicated he is scheduled for trial 
june 20 and is not testifying before the ntsb 
iarossi said it was just by chance that he heard of 
hazelwoods alcohol problem in may 1985 after the captain completed 
a hospital treatment program iarossi noted that such employee 
information usually is kept confidential 
after hazelwood returned to work he was monitored by two 
supervisors who visited him in port twice a month iarossi said 
exxon documents released wednesday portray the former captain as 
an able seaman with a history of depression and alcoholism 
the documents include a 1985 report on his admission to a 
hospital for alcohol treatment a doctor wrote that hazelwood then 
38 had been drinking excessively and was depressed and 
demoralized 
in other testimony thursday a ship engineer aboard the exxon 
valdez the night it ran aground recalled how he hazelwood and 
another crewman drank alcoholic beverages at a valdez bar and pizza 
restaurant in the hours before the tanker left port 
chief engineer jerzy glowacki repeated details he gave 
investigators shortly after the spill 
glowacki recalled meeting hazelwood and the ships radio officer 
at the pipeline club in valdez where they talked and drank 
i believe he was drinking vodka glowacki said of hazelwood 
glowacki recalled having three drinks but said he could not 
remember how many his fellow crewmen consumed 
the engineer who has known hazelwood for nearly 20 years said 
he could not recall hazelwood ever appearing intoxicated 
exxon also released hazelwoods work evaluations on wednesday 
they described him as getting along well with his crew and meeting 
the normal requirements of the position but lacking in 
creativitity or interest in managing a ship 
three of the four evaluations recommended at least temporary 
shore assignment but theres no indication company officials acted 
on the suggestions 
the last evaluation in 1987 said hazelwood handles unusual 
situations well and rated him above average on decisionmaking 
ability a 1984 report ranked him high on safety consciousness 
in iarossis testimony the executive also defended his 
companys response to the spill he said exxon shipping co 
mobilized equipment from around the world and got it to the scene 
quickly despite logistical problems 
iarossi said the successful movement of the 987foot tanker off 
a prince william sound reef and removal of the ships unspilled 
oil cargo prevented a far worse disaster 
it took a lot of heroics on a lot of peoples parts they did 
an absolutely miraculous job under very difficult circumstances 
iarossi said on the third day of an ntsb hearing that is to 
continue through saturday

the united auto workers on thursday 
requested a vote on collective bargaining at nissans smyrna plant 
where management complained the union was conducting a drawnout 
organizing campaign 
weve already told our dayshift employees through the use of 
a video that the petition has been filed that its of no 
particular surprise to us and that were glad to put this issue 
behind us said gail o neuman nissan motor manufacturing cos 
vice president of human resources 
the uaw filed the petition with the national labor relations 
board asking it to authorize 2400 production workers to vote 
whether they wish to be represented 
the inplant organizing committee feels the time is right 
they feel the enthusiasm inside the plant for the union is high 
union spokesman maxey irwin said 
i feel confident that the union will be soundly defeated 
ms neuman said the vast majority of our employees tell us they 
have no interest in paying 850000 a year in dues our 
communications open and they like that 
nissan employees who oppose the union picketed outside the 
factory gates with signs saying uaw go home american flags and 
at least one tshirt that said nissan love it or leave it 
ms neuman said the unions cardsigning campaign began more 
than 16 months ago and talk about the matter began years before 
that 
we feel that the uaw has had more than enough time to present 
its case to our employees the time has come to let our employees 
speak through a secret ballot election she said in a statement 
should the nlrb agree to allow the election it would be the 
first such vote at nissans only us factory the japanese company 
began producing pickup trucks in 1983 and now also produces sentra 
cars at the plant about 25 miles southeast of nashville 
nissan said last month it will add 2000 jobs and boost annual 
production to 440000 cars and light pickup trucks a year the 
company says that would make the smyrna plant the nations largest 
automobile production factory by 1992 
nlrb procedure calls for it to comment only once it verifies 
whether 30 percent of the workers signed cards for union 
representation said wayne barksdale the boards officer in 
nashville 
he said the nlrb could hold a hearing within two weeks with the 
company and the union to work out details of a vote 
irwin says the company has pushed production speeds causing 
injuries nissan says its health and safety record is better than 
most automotive companies in the united states 
the company says workers are happy with salaries that range from 
1255 to 1719 an hour and benefits that equal those of 
uaworganized auto plants

congressional tax writers voted tuesday to 
make savings and loan associations add 600 million to their share 
of an industry bailout through 1992 but rejected an income tax 
surcharge last used in the vietnam war to finance the governments 
50 billion share 
the house ways and means committee amended the sampl legislation 
to remove a provision that would have allowed sampls to escape 300 
million annual industry contributions in 1991 and 1992 toward the 
costs of financing the bailout the biggest in the nations history 
that provision had been slipped into president bushs bailout 
bill two weeks ago by house banking committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez dtexas at the urging by some of the industrys 12 
district federal home loan banks 
before approving the bill on a 2610 vote the taxwriting ways 
and means panel also fought off an attempt to pay for the 
government share of the bailout through a fiveyear 15 percent 
surtax on personal and corporate income taxes 
the defeated surtax would have been the first time such a 
revenueraising device was utilized by the government since the 
late president lyndon johnson used one in the late 1960s to finance 
the vietnam war 
its purpose was to save an estimated 200 billion in interest 
costs that taxpayers will have to absorb over the next 30 years by 
financing the governments share of the bailout through increased 
borrowing 
weve got garbage and none of us wants to carry it out said 
rep sam gibbons dfla who proposed the surtax so what were 
saying is that our children and grandchildren are going to carry it 
out thats just morally and ethically wrong 
gibbons surtax would have added another 150 in taxes a year 
for every 10000 in federal income taxes paid by an individual 
family or company it also would have violated president bushs 
pledge of no new taxes 
it was defeated on a 1013 vote after rep frank j guarini 
dnj said it would only derail everything thats been done 
in view of president bushs campaign pledge of no new taxes 
over bushs objection however the committee reaffirmed its 
vote last week to make the sampl bailout part of the federal deficit 
defeating his elaborate scheme to finance it through private market 
bond sales 
bushs proposed bond sales would increase the governments total 
debt but would have added a total of only 35 billion to the 
yearly deficits in fiscal 1989 1990 and 1991 allowing the 
appearance of overall annual reductions 
the ways and means committee vote to waive 
grammrudmanhollings sets a precedent that would render its budget 
discipline meaningless said treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
the congressional budget office and others have estimated that 
bushs plan would cost taxpayers an additional 45 billion in 
interest costs over the next 30 years than if the money was 
borrowed directly from the treasury 
under the direct government borrowing alternative approved by 
the house tax writers the deficit would swell by 93 billion this 
year 233 billion in fiscal 1990 and 138 billion in fiscal 
1991 those amounts would be exempted from grammrudman deficit 
reduction targets of 100 billion in fiscal 1990 and 64 billion in 
fiscal 1991 
on a voice vote the committee said that sampls have to contribute 
600 million more to the bailouts cost in 1991 and 1992 and 
potentially billions of dollars more over the next three decades by 
indexing increases in a required 300 million annual contribution 
to inflation 
bush in february had proposed the industry pay 300 million of 
the estimated 4 billion to 5 billion of the annual interest costs 
over the next 30 years for the bailouts costs 
the 300 million is in addition to approximately 6 billion in 
upfront money that the nations 3000 thrift institutions have to 
contribute to the plan 
but even with those amounts the congressional budget office 
cbo estimates that taxpayers will absorb 70 percent of the total 
estimated bailout tab of 280 billion including interest over the 
next 30 years

a federal appeals panel thursday denied a request 
by two chicago futures exchanges to halt the sale of a new type of 
security known as stock baskets at three competing exchanges 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals decision is the latest in 
a 14month series of legal and regulatory skirmishes between the 
securities and exchange commission and several of the exchanges 
the socalled stock baskets which allow investors to bet on the 
direction of the stock market as a whole rather than purchasing 
individual stocks are currently being sold at the philadelphia 
stock exchange and the american stock exchange in new york 
the product is called a cash index participation in philadelphia 
and an equity participation exchange at the amex when the sec 
approved the sale of stock baskets in march it also included the 
chicago board of options exchange in its decision 
the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
the nations two largest futures exchanges had asked the sec to 
delay its authorization of stockbasket products while their 
lawsuit was being heard by the appeals court 
while the lawsuit which names the sec as defendant will 
continue a threejudge panel of the 7th circuit said in a brief 
order that the stay was denied and set oral arguments in the case 
for july 9 
the bot and merc which previously offered similar products and 
likely would lose business to the stockbasket products contend 
the instruments are thinly disguised stock index futures and must 
be regulated by the commodity futures trading commission rather 
than the sec

the companys plants here in singapore and in hong kong citing a 
slowdown in the market for computer disk drives 
miniscribe reported earnings of 259 million or 65 cents a 
share for fiscal 1988 down from earnings of 311 million or 82 
cents per share in the previous fiscal year

stockholders in us district court both complaints allege that 
miniscribe officials made false and misleading statements to 
artificially inflate the companys stock
