tropical chocolate a 
synthetic that tastes like the real thing but wont melt in the 
heat could be ready for shipment to the persian gulf in time for 
the holidays 
the allelectric tank wont be 
military historians are fond of saying that generals are forever 
fighting the last war the army materiel command has the job of 
making sure that doesnt happen 
the amc which is responsible for research and development of 
gear used by the army is playing host this week to an exposition 
of what the future may hold for the nations warriors 
the soldier in the field is our customer said edward brown 
civilian deputy director of the amc office of technology management 
and planning 
the projects presented at this base 30 miles north of baltimore 
are in various stages of development from a wild idea to a 
concept on the verge of production 
the allelectric tank which would use batteries or 
superconducting technology is one of those projects way off in the 
future 
taken as a whole the projects represent the beginning of a 
shift from a neartotal preoccupation with the soviet threat to a 
realization the nation could face a myriad of military challenges 
in coming years 
the buzzword we use these days is that instead of weapons of 
mass destruction were looking to produce weapons of mass 
disruption said brown 
the object said brown is to create a smaller leaner but more 
effective force that can fight a smallscale war in a jungle as 
well as it could a major tank battle in central europe 
to that end the army and its scientists are pushing against the 
frontiers of science 
in laboratories across the country researchers are looking for 
military applications for the next generation of supercomputers and 
trying to harness recent breakthroughs in magnetics and 
superconductors 
they are working with corporations and universities on new 
fabrics to improve uniforms new materials to enhance tanks and 
personnel carriers and robots to reduce the danger to soldiers 
the scientists and managers gathered here envision an army in 
which the soldier has enhanced survivability and enhanced 
lethality 
in the next century the gi on patrol may carry his own computer 
along with tastier rations he may be wearing a selfcontained 
airconditioned uniform to protect him from the heat as well as 
chemical weapons 
generals will be able to rely on computers that produce 
corpslevel battle plans in 40 minutes a task that now takes at 
least a day 
and those computers will be able to give commanders a range of 
options and tell them when a battle plan isnt working and suggest 
appropriate responses 
officers will brief their troops using tv screens instead of 
pointers and paper maps on easels 
the technology expo is designed to spark new ideas as well as 
sell the nation on the importance of such work in an era of budget 
cuts 
the decision was very specifically made to keep the rampd as 
high as possible because thats the seed corn brown said 
thats the future were going to push the technology

the air force has added a ninth 
navigation satellite to an orbiting network capable of pinpointing 
us military units anywhere in the world to within 50 feet 
a delta rocket blasted off with the 65 million navstar 
satellite at 556 pm mondayabout 25 minutes later the satellite 
separated from the booster as planned and settled in an orbit 
12532 miles above earth 
everything appears to have gone well said air force lt 
col jim jannette two launch attempts late last week were delayed 
by bad weather 
the 3675pound satellite is part of a series of advanced global 
positioning system spacecraft designed to guide warplanes ships 
and other military craft with extreme accuracy the first navstar 
was launched in february 1989 
fifteen more navstar satellites are scheduled to be launched by 
early 1993 under the 85 billion program three will serve as 
spares 
the satellites which have a working lifetime of 7 years keep 
track of the speed of vehicles on land sea or air to within a 
fraction of a mile per hour inside each is an atomic clock with an 
error rate of one second every 300000 years 
the spacecraft can pinpoint locations within 50 feet in any 
weather anywhere in the world in some locations within 10 feet 
military personnel use receivers as small as telephones to tune 
into the network 
seven earlier less sophisticated satellites still are 
functioning

it was 1130 am when rude laughter and the 
whoosh of rushing water sundered deborah terrells algebra lesson 
the odds against the lesson already were high enough for ms 
terrell and her 19 eighthgraders at burnet street elementary 
school a magnet school where 200 of 500 children are homeless 
this day like most ms terrell has spent here for the last 
decade would be a melange of frustration fatigue selfdoubt and 
perhaps a small victory or two 
but as she spoke of equations a former student in a prankish 
mood gleefully sprayed the glass in her classroom door with jets 
from the hallway fire extinguishers 
see that she said pointing angrily to the truant this 
is fun what kind of life is that 
later that day as if sent to restore her faith a second 
visitor dropped in tawana woolridge a prim polite 12thgrader at 
newarks tough central high whom ms terrell had taught five years 
earlier 
she was my favorite teacher tawana said she wasnt too 
strict but she didnt let you get away with anything either 
when one kid like that comes back and is making it thats 
what makes it all worthwhile said the teacher 
 
3 pm at last 
most of the students leaving room 303 headed for baxter terrace 
or other downtown newark housing projects three caught buses for 
homeless shelters at the lincoln or carlton hotels 
ms terrell slumped back in her chair exhausted 
she hadnt always wanted to be a teacher she studied psychology 
at rutgers university but quickly lost her taste for it after an 
internship at a mental health center too depressing 
when i went to school everyone wanted to be a teacher i came 
here to burnet to do my student teaching the seventhgrade teacher 
left one day and the principal just gave me her class the rest is 
history 
at age 36 her chosen career now earns her about 33000 a year 
i dont see myself here for another 10 years but i guess i 
wonder if i leave whos going to be here for these kids 
later back home in her neat woodframe house on a 
toughlooking downtown newark street shed make sure her sons 
malcolm 8 and toussaint 9 buckled down to homework as her own 
mother once had for her 
but now as the last pupil straggled out she needed to 
decompress 
i have to wind down before i can see my kids she said if 
i dont take half an hour to wind down i might take things out on 
them 
after dinner homework awaited grading neatly bound projects 
hr students had prepared on the evils of drugs to mark national 
drug awareness month then she planned to phone parents to exhort 
them to attend open school night 
she wondered aloud am i just speaking to the air did anyone 
learn anything today 
she thought 
well i know murad learned something 
murad a bright cocky reedthin boy is quick with excuses and 
short on study habits ms terrell had forced him to sit in a desk 
alongside hers a spot known in her class as out of society 
but today murad actually had taken notes in class and used them 
to solve a math problem 
a small victory 
and ronald a big day for him too quiet withdrawn homeless 
for the last year ronald had stood up for the first time and given 
an oral presentation the class had applauded ronald had smiled 
shyly 
another victory 
victories come hard at burnet street designated four years ago 
a magnet school for homeless children in kindergarten through 
eighthgrade only last year did the board of education add staff 
and resources to help the school accommodate this most troubled 
population teachers say they have yet to get any formal training 
on how to deal with them 
kids were sleeping on desks had to meet bus schedules had to 
make stops at the grocery stores ms terrell said 
average daily attendance at burnet street is just 876 percent 
the national average is more than 92 percent twenty percent at 
burnet need special help with basic skills and 15 percent have 
been held back a grade or more only 5 percent of parents 
participate in school activities according to new jersey state 
statistics 
for ms terrell teaching is a daily gantlet of delays 
interruptions excuses 
the pa system squawks messages the bell rings every 45 minutes 
in the space of a morning the attendance teacher knocks on the 
door to take roll four hispanic students get pulled out of class 
for special english classes eight others are summoned for remedial 
classes to boost low english and math test scores still another 
group goes for computer instruction in the afternoon ms 
terrells homeless students are called away early to catch buses to 
shelters 
and then there are the excuses 
a kid tells her she didnt do her homework because i left the 
book in school ok 
at that ms terrells mouth twists upward in a streetwise curl 
that says without words you think i havent heard that nonsense a 
thousand times before you think youre kidding me i was raised in 
the same streets you were 
no she finally says thats not ok you know how i feel 
about excuses and thats not even a good one and get rid of the 
gum 
she has a way of mixing humor affection and discipline on her 
desk is a small sign u toucha my desk i breaka u face 
sometimes shell say with a hint of a smile you know how 
unrational i am 
how do the kids feel about her 
defiant yet dependent she sometimes invites her students to 
write what they think without signing their papers they write her 
things they wouldnt tell their parents about drugs aids their 
neighborhoods being homeless 
 
her kids say ms terrell sometimes gets teary during her life 
lectures when she speaks about what she wants for them why 
shes there 
one such talk comes minutes after the classs standardized state 
test scores arrive 
the 7th grade scores the ones her kids took the spring before 
show only 28 percent testing above average in math the lowest 
passing rate in the school by far 
oh brother she says were the lowest on the list 
everyone has so much time to talk and play talk and play 
what bothers me is i know you can do better these scores are 
garbage thats a reflection on me whatever i have to do to get 
this up i will do 
you always should expect to do the best for yourself theres 
too much potential in this room im just here to help you but you 
have to help me help you you already have the strikes against you 
youre minorities blacks puerto ricans so people look at these 
scores and say what did you expect 
i know where you belong and i want to take you i certainly 
dont want any of you in here next year shooting fire extinguishers 
at the window

lt enrique torruella swooped the 
uh1h huey helicopter below 1000 feet into the range of 
guerrilla rifle fire he banked the craft steeply in a tightening 
gyre then abruptly landed in the combt zone 
the copters deafening rotor flattened the waisthigh grass 
pvt manuel zepeda squinting through swollen eyes his face 
bloodied by shrapnel from a grenade ran to the waiting ship so 
did another soldier carrying on his back pvt santos alfaro badly 
wounded in the head and arm by the same explosion 
the aircraft was on the ground less than a minute torruella 
revved the turbojet engine and raced off before the aircraft 
reached safety beyond the range of enemy fire medic cpl tomas 
vasquez had a needle in alfaros arm and plasma dripping into his 
veins 
the grupo de helicopteros at ilopango air base five miles east 
of san salvador embodies the single most significant tactical 
advantage government forces have over the fmln leftist rebel army 
military analysts consider the infusion of helicopters and pilot 
training provided by washington from 198285 crucial in preventing 
the farabundo marti national liberation front from winning the 
civil war 
the fleet provides transport of troops and supplies rocket and 
machinegun support for ground troops and evacuation of nearly all 
the wounded government soldiers 
according to casualty statistics no job in the military is as 
dangerous as that of the squadrons 60 pilots during the past 18 
months it has become more so 
the guerrillas since early 1989 have worked diligently on 
antiaircraft tactics virtually all the approximately 65 aging 
hueys and the few newer hughes 500s making up the squad have been 
hit by ground fire 
several perhaps a dozen have been shot out of the sky the 
precise number is classified 
thirty pilots have been killed in action since the group was 
formed in 1982 most of the survivors have been wounded part of 
torruellas right foot was shot off in august 1989 when rifle fire 
pierced the floor 
charcoal portraits of 26 of those killed adorn a wall of the 
lobby of the groups headquarters once the four pending portraits 
are added there will be space for only two more before room will 
have to made on another wall 
the air force jealously guards information on rebel 
effectiveness against its planes and helicopters but by way of 
indication on both days an ap correspondent and photographer 
accompanied crews on medivac missions at least one ship was 
struck by gunfire 
most of the time damage is limited to perforations of the 
fuselage but if 762mm fire from guerrilla ak47s strikes the 
engine the tail rotor or hydraulic hoses the helicopter may crash 
or be forced to land off base 
rene a guerrilla squad leader based on the slopes of 
guazapa mountain 20 miles north of san salvador sat in the shade 
one recent afternoon and described triangulation the tactic 
concentrates fire of up to 15 aks on helicopters descending to 
either pick up wounded or deliver supplies 
the circling and dipping practiced by the pilots are intended to 
minimize guerrilla efficiency 
if you approach in a straight line they get a bead on you 
said torruella a smoothfaced 24yearold like several of the 
squads members he looks out of uniform more like an adolescent 
than a combat chopperjockey 
all the pilots except one a recent graduate of the local 
aviation school were trained at the us armys fort rucker in 
alabama 
they have the same training as us pilots that instruction 
combined with constant combat has made them among the best in the 
world practice makes perfect said lt col arch kielly us 
air force attache in el salvador 
military analysts say the air force especially the helicopter 
squadron was essential to beating back novembers largescale 
guerrilla offensive 
the fmln accused the government of indiscriminate rocket fire 
and strafing of densely populated urban neighborhoods where 
guerrillas had dug in 
air force authorities and us advisors dispute the allegation 
saying dozens of requests from ground troops for air support were 
denied for fear of inflicting unacceptable civilian casualties 
judging from what reporters saw during the offensive and from 
inspections of battlescarred neighborhoods afterward the truth is 
somewhere between the government and guerrilla claims 
aerial machinegun fire perforated roofs in several areas and 
rockets were launched into a few residential districts but intense 
use of air power appeared to have begun on the offensives fourth 
day when most civilians had evacuated the battle zones 
with the insurgents talking of a new offensive in coming weeks 
the pilots face a new peril the rebels reported acquisition of 
scores of shoulderfired surfacetoair missiles could prove to be 
a strategic watershed in the nearly 11yearold war 
employment of similar weapons in the 1980s by usbacked afghan 
guerrillas was one of the keys to the success of their campaign 
against soviet forces

thousands of people from alcoholics to 
soldiers are slogging through the nations potato fields in a race 
to salvage the rotting crop and save muscovites from a hungry 
winter 
joining the forced laborers in the muddy trenches of what the 
press has dubbed the potato front are volunteers who are 
lending a hand so they can carry home a sack or two of the starchy 
staple that has vanished from store shelves in the capital 
tatyana shcherbach who was ordered into harvest duties by her 
bosses at the lepes metallurgical factory laughed heartily as her 
three coworkers joked about president mikhail s gorbachev 
weve been wondering whether gorbachev eats potatoes like 
this she said holding up a halfrotten one or if he gets 
potatoes from the states 
her laughter spilled across the collective farms halfplowed 
rows in the village of peshki about 30 miles northwest of moscow 
along the highway to leningrad 
the 44yearold woman giggled saying she and her colleagues had 
concluded gorbachev would opt for the soviet spud because hes 
not the kind of man to eat anything special 
as a stiff wind blew chilled unprotected hands in the 40degree 
temperatures shcherbach said it helps to joke and make fun of 
one another it makes the job much easier and such weather 
requires jokes 
she and about 100 colleagues from the factory plunked the 
potatoes into pails and carried them to large sacks standing in the 
rows many potatoes in the field already were rotten shcherbach 
said holding a shriveled one in her soiled thin cotton gloves 
before discarding it 
drenching rains have turned the fields to mud crippling harvest 
operations for most of september and killing much of the crop 
moscow has only 7 percent of the potato stock it needs for the 
winter 
students and soldiers were drafted into the harvest weeks ago 
and leaders of moscows regional government invited city dwellers 
to go to nearby collective and state farms to help dig potatoes 
with an option to buy them at low prices 
as shcherbach spoke young red army soldiers busily collected 
the 110pound sacks of potatoes and hefted them into the arms of 
compatriots riding atop an open trailer pulled by an old tractor 
wed rather be doing something else admitted pvt taras 
grebnichenko of kiev the soviet union has ordered 23000 soldiers 
into harvest duties in the moscow area 
welcome to the gulag archipelago laughed one of a 
halfdozen soldiers warming themselves at a nearby bonfire 
referring to the alexander solzhenitsyn book about soviet labor 
camps 
the soldiers roasted some potatoes on the embers a blackened 
one was picked from the ashes and handed to a comrade who pulled a 
folded up newspaper containing salt from beneath his tunic 
seasoned it and offered it to eat 
they kidded each other as they passed around the potatoes do 
you know how to speak arabic one joked alluding to the persian 
gulf crisis and possible duty in a drier climate 
the mood was more sullen about 50 yards away where 40 
recovering alcoholics from moscow methodically picked up the 
potatoes under the close supervision of a brigade leader 
alcoholics in the soviet unions treatment centers frequently do 
such forced labor 
working in a different part of the field and espousing a 
different attitude was nikolai g gorodetsky im eager to help 
and get some potatoes as a result because the shelves are picked 
clean he said 
individuals like gorodetsky are entitled to keep every sixth 
sack of potatoes they dig or pay 45 cents for every 22 pounds for 
their entire bounty 
the engineer joined by his wife lyudmilla and teenage son 
sergei said his family would harvest four sacks about 440 pounds 
and give two of them back to the collective farm taking home 220 
pounds at a cost of about 45 
that price is no different than in state stores but long lines 
of shoppers have snapped up all the potatoes in those 
establishments those few potatoes still in moscows markets are 
grown in private plots by farmers who are charging more than three 
times the state price 
rooting in the field for potatoes is not humiliating work said 
gorodetsky who lives in the surrounding solnechnogorsk region but 
grew up in a village 
i like to do it he said i like being the master of the 
soil no one forces me this is the russian character 
yevgeny a nazarov of the moscow suburb of khimki also said he 
would carry home two sacks 
im here because potatoes are very expensive in the market and 
because of the recent rumors that in the winter we wont have any 
so its the only way to provide for ones family said the 
37yearold aircraft designer who has a wife and two children 
nazarov who said the potatoes would hold them for half the 
winter admitted to being frightened by reports of a winter of food 
shortages but added we hope the situation will change im an 
optimist

lama alsuleiman is angry at an 
american woman soldier she saw on television 
this woman said all those saudis have got to know that 
slavery time is over mrs alsuleiman snapped 
she decried the image of saudi arabia abroad saying its a 
picture of being imprisoned of women being beaten were not 
maltreated we just need a little bit of change 
some young saudis say change could be one result as foreign 
troops including women flood saudi arabia to confront iraq 
other observers say iraqs invasion of kuwait might slow the 
pace of change the 15yearold civil war in lebanon and the 1979 
revolution in iran have made the saudis skittish about aping the 
west seen here as the main cause of both upheavals 
with the crisis people will rethink what theyre doing its 
like walking on a knife blade said lawyer majid ghazawi 
however other saudis view the confrontation with iraq as a 
strong catalyst for change 
part of the basic education of any nation is to go through a 
crisis to mature said nidhal taibah a 25yearold architecture 
student 
in the meantime young saudis point out how much saudi arabia 
already has changed 
whatever you write dont bring in tents bedouins or 
camels mrs alsuleiman said 
young men and women acknowledge that their lives from studying 
to working to attitudes toward sex are packaged by rigid social 
and religious codes that many would like relaxed 
but the tribal hierarchy frowns on public debate much less 
rebellion so they say theyll have to wait until the whole country 
wants to alter its ways 
free speech women driving more public mingling between the 
sexes a more flexible educational system greater access to the 
arts and late marriages are all on their agenda 
you can force change from the top but if you do it too fast 
you tear the social fabric said a young official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
saudi arabia has no taxes work hours are limited and long 
vacations are not unusual government housing loans are 
interestfree the state pays for medicine and education college 
students get stipends of 266 a month 
saudis acknowledge the largesse breeds complacency 
we have to put some of the blame on ourselves for not 
demanding the things we want said manal fakeeh a 24yearold 
manager at a hospital 
recent graduates said they got a basic university education 
here but many especially the women said their choices were 
limited and classes uninspiring 
they think engineerings too tough for women to handle said 
mrs alsuleiman who is pursuing a masters degree in 
biochemistry 
because women are not permitted to mingle with men under 
strictly observed islamic law they watch their professors on 
closedcircuit television 
its more like corresponding than attendance mrs fakeeh 
said 
with time you dont feel you have the right to ask for what 
you want because you think this is only for boys said dina bin 
mahfouz a 25yearold sociology graduate 
if you think you have the right people will let you know 
youre extreme moving out of society trying to change things 
they dont like change 
both men and women said they face intense pressure to get 
married after graduation marriage although no longer arranged is 
still a family affair where the womans reputation is everything 
premarital sex is almost unknown 
its a big nono its something that doesnt happen taibah 
said if it happened in riyadh youd hear about it in jiddah 
you have to be a virgin because youre a moslem i wouldnt 
even think of it miss bin mahfouz said 
many young saudis accept the morality of islam but reject the 
ways its rules have been interpreted 
no one will criticize the government directly for the record 
but many regret what they see as a timid stance on reform and the 
toleration of religious teachers who issue bizarre statements like 
one proclaiming the world is flat 
while princes are accessible public debate and any hint of 
political organizing is squashed those who push too hard for 
change have their passports confiscated and are ostracized 
you dont tell the ogre its eyes are red said one young 
saudi who has been behind bars he spoke on condition of anonymity

a flood of criticism of a payasyouspray scheme 
to activate the citys claude and mildred pepper fountain with 
credit cards hasnt splashed cold water on the plan 
the idea came up two weeks ago because the city says it cant 
afford to spend the 42 an hour or so it costs to run the 32 
million fountain whose computercontrolled water jets are designed 
to mimic the sea 
and city commissioners appear prepared to at least consider the 
proposal to install a machine like a banks automatic teller 
despite a deluge of ridicule 
its the most preposterous thing ive ever heard of in my 
entire life said howard kleinberg former editor of the miami 
news and now a history columnist for the miami herald to think 
of the endless possibilities this opens to credit cards 
as plastic as the plan may seem the commissioners are 
considering it as a sort of user fee to save taxpayers dollars as 
it stands no money is budgeted in the tight fiscal year that 
started monday to run the fountain named after the late miami 
congressman and his wife 
city manager cesar odio said his 269 million budget just cant 
spare the 370000 a year it would cost to keep the fountain 
running 
we can only afford to run it about two minutes a day he 
quipped 
the city is in the midst of its worst financial squeeze in at 
least 10 years so why not let those who want to muse before the 
mists pay for the pleasure 
i dont see anything negative about it said commissioner 
jl plummer 
the fountain at bayfront park in the heart of the tourist 
district was switched on in july and runs just several hours a 
day the rest of the time it sits idle its empty moat attracting 
skateboarders its saucershaped granite centerpiece dry 
an electrical contracting firm whose principals are active in 
civic affairs suggested the creditcard scheme 
i hate to see the city of miami get a black eye over this 
said paco farach president of the company edd helms electrical 
contracting inc the credit card thing is an interim solution to 
attract attention and create initial excitement 
farach says the company would guarantee to run the fountain at 
least 3000 hours during the next three years at a cost of about 
150000 and it has offered 10000 to start a corporate 
sponsorship program that would allow the creditcard machine to 
offer discounts to employees of companies that sign up as sponsors 
he envisions a machine that would take visa american express 
and mastercard 
the concept would have greatly disturbed the late isamu noguchi 
said shoji sadao the architect who worked with the sculptor on the 
fountain 
hed be very upset and very disappointed and just completely 
discouraged said sadao it certainly is a last resort if i 
had my choice i would not want to have something thats for the 
public having to be funded by private citizens but if it gets down 
to either that way or no fountain at all then id have to go with 
that choice 
one fan of the fountain is bryn mckim a recent transplant from 
oregon who loves to spend her lunch hour in the sun reading next 
to the spray 
sure id use an atm machine mckim said ive never heard 
of anything like that before but hey you have to try new 
things 
pointing to the dry fountain mckim said like that it looks 
like a meteor struck the park 
jeff homer whose nearby office building faces the fountain 
disagrees 
it seems tacky homer said of the creditcard plan if 
they found all that money to build this they should be able to 
find the money to keep it going

the strategically located korean 
peninsula is in the vortex of rapidly developing new relationships 
that may change the political landscape of northeast asia 
for the first time since the end of world war ii countries that 
have been bitter adversaries and battleground enemies are talking 
to one another delicate relations are being slowly cautiously 
realigned 
northeast asia is unique in that it engages the vital interests 
of four of the worlds great powers the united states the soviet 
union japan and china the tense and bitterly divided korean 
peninsula sits at its geographical heart 
all four countries are involved in and will be affected by 
changes in korea all four governments have an interest in security 
and peace on the peninsula and all four have economic reasons for 
wanting to encourage friendly ties between north and south korea 
the result is a gradual restructuring of alliances some of them 
unthinkable as recently as two or three years ago 
south korea and the soviet union established full diplomatic 
relations on sunday for the first time since russia and the yi 
dynasty broke off ties in 1905 the announcement followed by three 
days north koreas stated intention to open talks on normalizing 
relations with japan 
the two moves are seen as catalysts in breaking down cold war 
barriers and point toward the possibility of eventual recognition 
of the rival koreas by the others allies the united states and 
japan recognizing north korea and beijing and moscow recognizing 
south korea 
the surge in political activity comes as the divided germanys 
unite an event that holds deep emotional significance for all 
koreans who feel shamed at the division of korea 
the mending of decades of distrust between two koreas with 
starkly opposing ideologies is not expected to be quick or easy 
president roh taewoo hopes to see unification by the end of the 
century dissidents and radical students who harp on immediacy say 
it will take five years 
confrontation and tensions continue to hamper the relations 
between the two divided parts of korea said roh said on monday 
but he said new ties will make it impossible for north korea 
alone to resist the tidal wave of change 
prime ministers of the koreas held talks in september the 
highestlevel contact ever between the two nations a second round 
of talks is scheduled for this month 
because of its geography korea long has served both as a buffer 
and an invasion route for its powerful neighbors in the last 
century alone three wars have been fought on korean territory for 
35 years until 1945 korea was occupied by the japanese 
the peninsula was divided in 1945 and in 1950 north korea 
invaded the south launching a threeyear civil war that left more 
than 4 million people killed and wounded a peace treaty was never 
signed 
the border remains tightly sealed distrust and suspicion are 
rampant there is no mail telephone communication or travel 
between the two sides 
the longsought impetus for change has been the need for money 
and technology 
north korea is virtually bankrupt wealthy japan just 350 miles 
away could provide desperately needed capital and technology 
japan could find in north korea cheap labor raw materials and a 
land route into asia 
the soviet union also in need of capital has found in south 
korea a willing investor as well as factories anxious to build and 
market high technology 
the seoul government reportedly expects to sign an agreement for 
more than 2 billion in aid to moscow some also see the soviets 
ties to seoul as bait for japan which has turned down moscows 
overtures for investments 
china longtime ally of north korea needs to expand its 
markets and is expected to open trade offices with seoul before the 
end of the year 
south korea hopes relations with both china and the soviet union 
will stop beijing and moscow from vetoing its attempts to enter the 
united nations 
for its part washington hopes eased tensions will insure 
stability in the region eventually allow a scaleback of 43000 
us troops stationed in south korea and remove an excuse for 
antiamericanism 
for south korea new relations with the soviet union are the 
culmination of a vigorous twoyear campaign to develop ties with 
allies of the north 
the ties between seoul and moscow will have significant 
bearing on the charting of a new world order said kim hakjoon 
a top aide to roh we are seeing new opportunities for progress 
in northeast asia

when martin meyer of chicago set out 
to join the french foreign legion the legendary fighting force 
enshrined in film and song he faced one big hurdle finding their 
paris outpost 
it took meyer 24 hours of wandering the french capital before he 
stumbled upon fort norgent and told the burly legionnaires inside 
he had come to join up 
i knocked on the gate he recalled they tell you to 
wait 
it may not have been a glorious start to meyers stint in the 
foreign legion whose troops are the veterans of countless battles 
in jungles and deserts the world over their exploits made famous 
in pc wrens novel beau geste 
but now he is a 28yearold corporal and was among the first 
legionnaires to land in saudi arabia as part of the multinational 
force deployed to the region after iraq invaded kuwait 
there are 2300 legionnaires among the french ground troops and 
meyer is one of three americans the legion is 40 percent french 
and 60 percent foreigners culled from 90 nationalities 
like countless hardliving legionnaires before him meyer left 
behind a troubled past 
a native of arvada colo he crisscrossed the united states 
with a mother and two brothers he was the child of a broken home 
he said 
we had a lot of family troubles said meyer ive always 
been the black sheep 
five years ago he said his wife walked out on him in mexico 
mo taking their baby with her 
i just wanted to disappear he said ill never see them 
again 
he had first headd about the foreign legion during a threeyear 
stint with the us air force in west germany that ended in 1981 
and read about it in combat magazines 
after his wife left he said he checked out a book on the 
legion from the public library he applied for a passport and he 
left chicago on a chilly autumn day in 1985 
in some ways meyer was a textbook recruit legion officials say 
most applicants are mavericks who find they just do not fit into 
society false identities are not uncommon nor are past brushes 
with the law murderers and serious criminals are not welcome 
however 
in paris once meyer had passed an initial round of interviews 
with the legion they took away his possessions and shipped him 
south to their headquarters in aubagne there he underwent a 
twoweek round of physical and mental tests and relentless 
questioning 
about half of the wouldbe volunteers are accepted they agree 
to stay in the force for at least five years they learn french 
and undergo difficult even brutal physical training 
legionnaires get regular army pay afterward they are 
recommended for french citizenship 
formed in 1831 by king louisphilippe the legion lost some of 
its luster in recent years with frances bruising defeats in 
algeria and vietnam but a modernday legionnaire is still likely 
to see action in frances farflung former possessions 
six months after joining meyer was sent to the former french 
colony of djibouti on the red sea then the african nations of 
chad and gabon 
the legionnaires arriving in saudi arabia are heading for the 
front in armoured personal carriers with some light artillery 
we are very im losing my english said meyer searching 
for the word expendable we are the frontline forces 
he has never seen combat he hopes he will in the saudi desert 
i love it this is what we trained for he said i just 
hope they let us do it 
he does have one worry chemical weapons iraq is known to 
possess them and has used them in combat 
but we have to be ready for anything he said if its a 
mantoman trooptotroop battle we will win

dozens of kgb and police officers 
gathered recently around the blue mosque in tashkents crumbling 
old city and listened warily as an islamic cleric boomed out a call 
for political action 
allah akbar god is great shouted thousands of male voices 
in response to the mullahs call for islam to replace communism 
a few miles from the mosque workers were building an iron and 
concrete fence around the uzbekistan communist party headquarters 
which local newspapers report is being converted to a presidential 
palace 
workers said the fence will be electrified to hold back any mobs 
that might attack uzbek leaders as romanian mbs did during a 
revolution in that balkan nation last year 
they fear the romanian variant said abdulrashid sharif of 
berlik an uzbek popular movement he said public anger was rising 
against the reported corruption of uzbekistans communist 
leadership 
uzbekistan a central asian republic of 20 million about the 
size of soontobe united germany is a backwater of poverty at the 
edge of the democratic reform sweeping other parts of the soviet 
union 
some local leaders have called for political unity among the 
central asian republics against the ethnic russiandominated 
leadership in moscow unrest already has broken out in three areas 
of uzbekistan and the republics communist officials appear to be 
girding for more demonstrations 
we see on television what is happening in the baltics in 
russia and moldavia sharif said 
unlike their counterparts in the baltic and russian republics 
the uzbek communist party has kept its grip on power it banned 
demonstrations in february and suppressed a democratic opposition 
movement activists said 
in uzbekistan the power of the communists has not changed 
since the days of stagnation said activist igor kadirov who 
lives in the industrial city of almalyk the period of 
stagnation is the soviet term for the 196482 rule of leonid 
brezhnev 
uzbekistans per capita income is half the soviet average and 
10 percent of the population is jobless many of the highpaying 
jobs in the gold and gas fields go to russians rather than the 
native uzbeks the uzbeks make up 69 percent of the population 
russians 11 percent with the rest a mixture of ethnic groups 
the gas and gold produced in uzbekistan is controlled by the 
central government in moscow with few benefits flowing to the 
people of uzbekistan said poet yodgor obid a member of berlik 
natural gas lines to russia pass right through uzbek villages which 
have no gas themselves 
uzbek reformers have their eyes on the new president of the 
russian federation boris yeltsin who quit the communist party in 
july and has persuaded the legislature to approve sweeping 
political and economic changes 
but uzbek communist leaders have suppressed the local democratic 
movement reformers say 
while tens of thousands were allowed to march to the kremlin 
walls in july and september to denounce communism demonstrations 
in uzbekistan have been banned since february 
the uzbek communist party says its publishing house the only 
one in the republic capable of printing newspapers will refuse to 
print national publications it does not approve of kadirov said 
the new national law on freedom of the press which took effect in 
august is being ignored in uzbekistan 
leaders of berlik the popular movement that claims 15 million 
members said members are often arrested and beaten by police 
uzbekistan already has exploded in ethnic economic and 
political violence in the fergana andizhan and parkent areas as 
many as 800 were killed in june in uzbekkirgiz clashes in osh 
just over the border in kirgizia 
locals say such bloody outbursts could recur 
the situation is very dangerous and tense said damin 
narzikolov a berlik leader 
the tension is causing many ethnic russians to flee they crowd 
the tashkent rail office every day arranging their moves back 
home 
were afraid its dangerous to walk on the streets said 
railworker yuri yurtaev an ethnic russian 
we have nothing against russians who want to work said 
yodgor obid but those who want to command as a colonial power 
those can go 
despite the efforts of uzbek authorities to control dissent 
more and more infrmation is being published on corruption among 
officials newspapers recently disclosed that for the past 30 
years only children of the party elite have been accepted to 
prestigious foreign language and law schools 
the soviet press has carried numerous stories about official 
corruption in uzbekistan and many of the republics top leaders 
were convicted for collecting payments for nonexistent cotton 
the gradual lifting of restrictions on religion has freed moslem 
leaders to move into politics leading russians and nonmoslems to 
worry they will follow the lead of nearby iran into religious 
fundamentalism 
signs of fundamentalism were visible at the blue mosque where 
young moslem men glared in fury at a foreign woman escorted briefly 
into the service by an islamic official

about 30000 hindus considered 
untouchables in the countrys rigid caste system have adopted 
buddhism in the largest mass conversion in nearly a decade 
according to news reports 
the ceremony took place saturday in agra the site of the taj 
mahal about 110 miles south of new delhi 
the indian express newspaper said the conversions were prompted 
by clashes in june with uppercaste hindus near agra 
seven people were killed and 110 were injured in the threeday 
riots that began when a wedding procession was attacked by 
uppercaste hindus protesting the noise 
welcoming the converts a local politician sangh priya gautam 
said buddhism was the only religion based on realism and 
equality press trust of india reported 
the converts called harijans were below the complex hindu 
caste system that determines a persons social standing by birth 
and often affects economic position 
harijans are not assigned any caste making them 
untouchables for the higherborn hindus in many indian 
villages the socalled outcastes are not allowed to use umbrellas 
or wear shoes when in an uppercaste neighborhood 
despite official government rejection of the caste system it is 
prevalent in rural india efforts by harijans to assert their 
rights have often led to clashes with the upper castes 
university students who belong to upper castes have also been 
protesting some by selfimmolation an august government decree 
setting aside 49 percent of civil service jobs for lowcaste 
workers 
saturdays ceremony took place while hindus celebrated one of 
their most important festivals the dusshera which marks the 
victory of good over evil 
about 60 monks supervized the conversion the largest since 
1981 when about 300000 lowcaste hindus embraced buddhism in the 
western town of nagpur 
there are about 47 million buddhists in india comprising less 
than 1 percent of indias 800 million people 
hindus make up about 82 percent of the population 
buddhism which does not have castes was founded in india as a 
religion and philosophy about 2500 years ago by siddhartha 
gautama it teaches the practice of meditation and observance of 
moral principles

yosemite national park 
celebrates its 100th birthday monday hundreds of millions of years 
after the formation of the sierra nevada that glaciers later carved 
into majestic valleys 
the 748542acre park was created by congress on oct 1 1890 
26 years after the federal government gave yosemite valley to 
california for use as a public park and recreation area the park 
is about 130 miles east of san francisco 
john muir a naturalist first saw the area in the 1860s and his 
enthusiastic reports help spark interest in preserving yosemite 
now some 34 million people visit the park each year 
during the past century yosemite has seen controversies and 
disasters development interests and concessionaires have battled 
environmentalists about how much to build in the park this summer 
a fire raged through yosemite closing the valley for 11 days and 
burning 23000 acres 
but the park that includes el capitan half dome yosemite falls 
one of the worlds tallest waterfalls has survived its granite 
rock faces and tall trees reaching ever upward 
we believe weve seen 100 years of preservation and were 
working hard to ensure that the next 100 years are even going to be 
better for the visitors and the park said yosemite 
superintendent michael finley 
a ceremony marking the milestone will be held monday 
the sierra was created hundreds of millions of years ago when 
the earths plates collided according to generally accepted 
scientific theory ice ages then came unleashing glaciers tens of 
thousands of years ago

the likelihood of war in the persian gulf has 
grown significantly as sanctions and a hostile world push saddam 
hussein into a corner with no diplomatic escape european and 
israeli military analysts say 
but they say there is still a window for peace before the 
effects of sanctions sink in further and usled forces in saudi 
arabia become strong enough to consider launching a military 
operation to push iraq out of kuwait 
i think another six to eight weeks is available to prevent a 
conflict but after that it becomes almost inevitable said paul 
beaver publisher of janes defense weekly 
with the united nations demanding an unconditional iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait and iraq reiterating almost daily that it 
will never leave the analysts see little room for a negotiated 
solution 
saddam hussein could well now be driven into a corner which 
makes negotiations difficult and we could see a situation where he 
is left with very few options and those all being of a military 
nature beaver said in an interview 
dominique moisi deputy director of the french institute for 
international relations in paris said he would love to see a 
diplomatic option but it would mean that saddam hussein 
gives in to western pressure and its rather unlikely 
a compromise is still possible he said in which iraq would 
withdraw in return for agreement to hold an international 
conference to redefine kuwaits boundaries give iraq access to the 
sea and redistribute kuwaiti oil reserves 
but i do not see it in the cards right now moisi said 
maybe in the very beginning a diplomatic option might have been 
open now its a bit late 
even if iraq withdraws from kuwait which would satisfy the 
united nations the rest of the world has to be assured that saddam 
doesnt have the potential to strike again or continue developing 
nuclear and chemical weapons beaver said 
col andrew duncan assistant director for information at the 
international institute of strategic studies endorsed what he 
called a scattershot search for a peaceful solution being pursued 
by individuals and groups in the arab world and the west 
but both the united nations and the arab league have got to be 
the major players in the solution he said 
iraq believes support for the un embargo will eventually 
crack said ian anthony a researcher at the stockholm peace 
research center 
iraqs agenda now is to change the situation so radically in 
kuwait that it can never be put back to where it was anthony 
said he said iraq recently tried to depopulate kuwait by opening 
its borders baghdad has also moved large numbers of palestinians 
into kuwait to change the population balance 
moisi said he believes american objectives can only be achieved 
through war 
so unfortunately i think that war is the most probable 
outcome although paradoxically no one really wants it he said 
american military leaders are obsessed with the limitations 
imposed by the government on the us military during the vietnam 
war and are not likely to engage in a war without using all 
the means at their disposal moisi said 
duncan said iraq missed its best chance to attack saudi arabia 
immediately after its aug 2 invasion when the americans were not 
yet on the scene 
the usled forces now are just about in position to defend 
saudi arabia but a lot more is required before an offensive 
operation to retake kuwait beaver said 
us ground forces are not strong enough duncan said and it 
will be at least a month before enough tanks to face the iraqis 
arrive in saudi arabia 
the world alliance will not even be prepared for a 
military action until sometime in november said joseph alpher 
deputy head of the jaffee center for strategic studies at tel aviv 
university 
the ideal option for usled forces would be to wait for iraq 
to make the first move and respond which would be more popular in 
the west and especially in the arab world analysts said 
but i dont think it will be a prerequisite for a us and 
allied action alpher said 
if the mulinational force attacks a usled air strike 
followed by a ground attack would almost certainly be used to try 
to recapture kuwait the analysts agreed 
will it be on kuwait or will it be on iraq itself i think all 
options are open moisi said 
an attack by arab terrorists could also trigger a war the 
analysts said 
israel also has to give credence to saddams threat to attack 
israel if the embargo strangles his country alpher said 
i think the danger is to underestimate saddam hussein to 
believe he will be a fool moisi said he has not been a fool 
so far

as much of the world retreats from communism 
chinese premier li peng has toasted the partys 41year rule with 
praise for its great glorious and correct leadership 
li also lauded the army and police for their roles in 
controlling dissent and implementing new anticrime measures 
li made the toast sunday at an annual reception for foreign 
diplomats on the eve of the anniversary of the 1949 birth of the 
peoples republic of china following the overthrow of the 
nationalist government 
athletes from chinas asian games team also attended and mingled 
with the top leaders who begged for autographs the 36nation 
games are under way in beijing and scheduled to close oct 7 
the communist party turned an impoverished backward old china 
which was subjected to the bullying and enslavement by colonialism 
and imperialism into a socialist new china with initial 
prosperity li said in his 15minute toast 
the communist party of china is a great glorious and correct 
party we have every ability to manage our own affairs well and 
socialist china has a bright future full of infinite promise he 
said 
chinese leaders maintain that the collapse of socialism in 
eastern europe is only a temporary setback and capitalism will 
eventually fail since putting down a prodemocracy movement in 
1989 chinese officials have kept tight controls on any dissent and 
filled the official media with praise of the party 
the premiers annual national day toast serves as an abridged 
stateofthenation address summarizing chinas political and 
economic situation and the basic domestic and foreign policies 
this years toast contained no surprises reaffirming the 
governments determination to maintain a planned economy 
li said the government was intensifying efforts to complete a 
new fiveyear plan for submission to the party central committee 
he gave no explanation for the plans delay believed to be the 
result of sharp disagreement over resuming marketstyle economic 
reforms the new plan is due to take effect in january 
li praised an anticrime campaign that has resulted in more than 
650 death sentences being handed down from january to august 
according to the human rights group amnesty international 
in an unusual move party general secretary jiang zemin attended 
the reception held in the great hall of the people the annual 
event generally is considered a state affair rather than a party 
function 
the exiled leader of cambodias rebel resistance prince norodom 
sihanouk also attended and sat between jiang and li 
sihanouk said several weeks ago that he was ailing and would 
take a leave of absence from political and diplomatic activities

conversation with jiang 
several party elders were absent including vice president wang 
zhen 82 senior leader deng xiaoping 86 has retired from all

here is a transcript of remarks made by 
president bush and congressional leaders sunday at a rose garden 
ceremony announcing a budget agreement between the white house and 
congressional negotiators 
i am joined here today by the leadership of the congress the 
speaker of the house the senate majority leader the senate 
repubican leader the president pro tem of the senate the house 
majority leader and the house republican leader and other members 
of the budget summit negotiating group 
the bipartisan leaders and i have reached agreement on the 
federal budget 
over five years it would reduce the projected deficit by 500 
billion that is half a trillion dollars 
the agreement has five basic parts 
first it would save 119 billion in entitlement and mandatory 
programs 
second it would produce 182 billion in discretionary program 
savings these savings would come principally from defense in the 
next three years defense outlays would be reduced by 67 billion 
relative to the projected baseline 
all other discretionary programs would be firmly capped at the 
projected baseline level that is for the next three years they 
would in total be allowed to grow at no more than the inflation 
rate 
third the agreement would increase tax revenues by 134 
billion the largest single increase single contributor would be a 
phasedin increase in the gasoline tax of five cents per gallon in 
the first year and another five cents in the following years 
i do not welcome any such tax measure nor do i expect anybody 
up here does 
however this one does have the virtue not only of contributing 
to deficit reduction but also overtime of decreasing americas 
dependence on foreign oil an objective whose importance has become 
increasingly evident in the face of the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
i am pleased to be able to note that the budget agreement also 
includes several new incentives to increase domestic exploration 
and development of our own gas resources 
the combination of these measures should help reduce americas 
vulnerability to the interruption of supplies of foreign oil 
imports 
fourth the agreement extends the grammrudman budget discipline 
for five years 
in addition it improves the budget process and substantially 
strengthens the enforceability of the fiveyear budget plan to 
which we have agreed 
fifth this agreement includes important new initiatives to 
stimulate economic growth 
it authorizes new tax incentives for the development of 
enterprise zones extends the rampd tax credit it provides powerful 
new incentives in the kinds of companies that account for most of 
americas job growth 
these incentives include a new 30 percent credit for rampd 25 
percent deduction for the purchase of new equity indexing of the 
basis of new stock in such companies expansion of investment in 
tangible equipment and scientific equipment a minimum basis rule 
it encourages investment in new ventures and in companies with 
highgrowth potential and other such incentives 
in addition to these targetedgrowth incentives i would note 
that prompt enactment of this entire fiveyear deficitreduction 
package would itself help stimulate longterm economic growth 
with a halfatrillion dollars in real deficit reduction and 
let me repeat the leaders here and i think that these are real 
deficit reduction figures longterm interest rates should be able 
to come down 
this package should be a strong component of a positive 
responsible fiscal and monetary policy 
i heartily thank the negotiators who have worked so long and so 
hard to develop this package the bipartisan congressional 
leadership and i have pledged our very best to get this entire 
package signed into law by october 19th 
as any such plan would have to ours requires that virtually 
everyone contribute in some way it is balanced it is fair and in 
my view it is what the united states of america needs at this point 
in its history and we are united in our fim determination to see 
this program enacted 
i do not want to imply that some who have not been in the final 
negotiations are for every part of this but i can only speak for 
my part and then the top leadership here will speak 
but i will simply say this is priority this is priority for 
our nation this is something that the country is calling out for 
and world markets are looking for 
and so there will be some tough fights ahead but i have pledged 
to the speaker to congressman gephardt to bob michel on our side 
to george mitchell and bob dole and the senate pro tem leader 
senator byrd that i will do everything i can to lay aside 
partisanship here and to take this take the case for this deal to 
the american people in every way i can 
sometimes you just dont get it just the way you want and this 
is such a time for me and i suspect such a time for everybody 
standing here 
but its time put the interests of the united states of america 
first and get this deficit under control and mr speaker im 
grateful to you the democrats and the republicans for seeing that 
the interests of this country come first 
thank you for what youve been doing and id appreciate it if 
you want to say a few words

speaker of the house tom foley 
thank you very much mr president ill be brief in just echoing 
what you have yourself just said sir 
this is a package that your negotiators and the bipartisan 
participating negotiators from the house and the senate ranking 
republican members chairmen and the leadership on both sides have 
sought to achieve 
its not going to be easy or simple to obtain the votes that are 
necessary in both the house and the senate the majority of both 
parties in both bodies that will have to be found to enact this 
package and within the next three weeks 
but we pledge our efforts with yours to convince our colleagues 
and the country that this is strong undergirding of our economic 
future our national prosperity and joint national interests and 
in that spirit we are going to begin today to present to you 
legislation which will allow the orderly functioning of the federal 
government for the continuation of this next week in preparing to 
take the first step to implement this program 
i want to pay a word if i can a special thanks to all my 
colleagues who participated in this and especially to dick 
gephardt the chairman of these budget negotiations who all sides 
republicans and democrats senators and house members and you 
yourself have spoken eloquently to his patience and leadership 
thank you sir for your involvement and your determination to 
aid in the process of bringing this package in the interest of the 
country to final achievement 
 
senate majority leader george mitchell 
thank you mr president 
now comes the hard part its one thing to get a budget 
agreement among ourselves for which all involved should be 
commended 
its another thing to get the votes to pass it through the house 
and the senate that is a task to which we must now commit 
ourselves 
this agreement is a compromise both sides can accurately say 
that the agreement includes provisions they dont like both sides 
can also accurately say the agreement doesnt include some 
provisions they think should be included 
cutting the deficit requires difficult choices but our nations 
economic future requires that we make those choices 
we have already debated too long now we must act decisively 
 
senate minority leader robert dole 
mr president thank you very much and i want to thank my 
colleagues and again particularly dick gephardt 
the nay sayers the nit pickers may have a field day because the 
easy vote in this case is to find something you dont like and vote 
no 
but in my view we owe more to the american people than finding 
fault with what i consider to be a good agreement good positive 
solid agreement that in my view will help the american economy and 
demonstrate to the american people who are sometime somewhat 
cynical that the congress and the president and of the united 
states can work together and we can look ahead and we can do the 
right thing for our country 
and so i would hope that my colleagues and i speak now to my 
colleagues certainly will study this document very carefully will 
give it their best effort and when the roll is called that we will 
have a majority of republicans and democrats for this outstanding 
package 
thank you mr president 
 
 
house majority leader dick gephardt 
forty years ago a mountaineer who joined in the first successful 
climb of mt everest explained the success by saying no 
expedition enjoyed better teamwork 
to the speaker of the house congressman foley senate majority 
leader george mitchell to the members of congress who are here 
with us on the stage to the administration and their 
representatives and the great staffs of all sides who worked so 
long and so hard with us you have been heroic as weve made this 
climb together 
the american people are today asking why was this summit 
necessary why did it take so long and what did it achieve 
if we are to enact this agreement and i think we must these 
questions must be answered persuasively and honestly 
for ten years we have chosen a course together that has created 
large deficits and limited our capacity to meet the needs of our 
people and the demands of a very challenging age 
today we face a weakened economy and high rates of interest and 
inflation tomorrow in absence of an agreement massive 
acrosstheboard budget cuts would occur 
the alternative to this agreement is fiscal chaos to meet our 
responsibility to americas working families this summit simply 
had to succeed 
what delayed us for months is what has divided us for a decade 
the parties to these talks had and continue to have deep 
disagreements over values the role of government and the fairness 
of our taxes but we all made compromise in the national interest 
to bring this process to a successful conclusion all of us the 
american people and our national leaders must accept the 
responsibilities of the day 
and as this debate unfolds i hope this will be said that we 
achieved the largest deficitreduction package in our history that 
we focused the national debate on whether the tax code will be 
based on everybodys individual ability to pay that vital issues 
investing in our people making our nation competitive and 
realizing social justice will rise again on the national agenda and 
that enactment of this measure will enable us to confront these 
important issues successfully in the years to come 
i thank you mr president and i thank all of the members of the 
summit 
 
house minority leader bob michel 
thank you mr president and my colleagues 
i support the package wholeheartedly because i was one of the 
narrower group that within the last days last ten days or so made 
some of the final decisions 
there may be some reservations with respect to some of our other 
summiteers on the platform i think probably rightly so because 
were making decisions that reach far out into five years 
everyone is entitled to know exactly what we have wrought in the 
printed word as a matter of fact i dont have wasnt privy to 
the last few lines that were written early this morning 
but on balance when i look at what we were originally faced 
with and here we are refraining from increasing marginal rates and 
not touching the unmentionable out there social security 
and then to have the incentives for growth that i see here and 
the expenditure caps over the next several years that are real and 
enforceable it seems to me that in the alternative so much better 
that weve done what weve done and hopefully that in the ensuing 
days well be able to sell a majority of the members on both sides 
of the aisle in both houses to give us the affirmative both that i 
think is so imperative that i think that we have before we adjourn 
 
president bush 
thank you all very much and let me conclude by singling out the 
white house team by name secretary brady and dick darman john 
sununu who stayed in there day in and day out with the members of 
congress 
in my view they did an outstanding job too 
you know sen bentsen said in this meeting i its not 
betraying a confidence that he hoped that i would do my level best 
to take this case to the american people 
and i told him inside what i want to repeat here that i will 
do everything i can to generate support from the american people 
for this compromise 
i am convinced that the american people do not want to see us 
continue to mortgage the futures of their children and their 
grandchildren 
and as i say compromise is the word here all of us have had to 
do that 
but to sen bentsen i said in there and i would say here 
publicly i want the american people to understand how important we 
feel this is 
i want them to understand this is real this is not a phony 
smoke and mirrors deficitcutting program and i will do everything 
in my power to help the leadership republican and democrat get 
this passed in the united states congress 
thank you all very much for coming

breadlines are forming in the streets of 
washington these days but this isnt a story about poverty to the 
contrary 
this is about people who to their own amused astonishment are 
willing to wait an hour to lay out 375 for a twopound loaf of 
rye 
its bizarre exults baker mark furstenberg surveying 
people streaming hopefully into his marvelous market even though 
the sign on the door proclaims sorry no more bread 
furstenberg 52 started selling bread on connecticut avenue 
eight weeks ago traditional french baguettes boules and 
brioches fragrant rosemary bread pungent sourdough full of black 
olives sweet fig and currant loaves coursegrained slightly 
bitter ryes multigrain loaves handsome hefty oldfashioned 
loaves of bread that cost 125 to 750 
initial production was 300 pounds a day now that the local 
press has taken notice the oven works from 11 pm through the 
night and into the following afternoon producing 1200 pounds 
daily it still cant meet demand 
furstenberg is proving an old adage but better bread is his 
better mousetrap 
most days the breadline forms an hour before opening time the 
overnight production is gone within a few hours 
people who ordinarily would fuss about a fiveminute wait in a 
supermarket hang around for the fresh production satisfied some 
break off their first bite on the way out 
the state department putting on a banquet asked to buy an 
entire days output furstenberg refused he wouldnt deprive his 
neighborhood customers 
suburbanites drive in for the bread the bakery rations sales to 
two loaves per customer some make extravagant appeals for a third 
loaf for my pregnant sister who cant come in they beg to 
have bread airexpressed to distant relatives 
who are these people furstenberg asks in mock despair 
after all its only bread 
but he knows who they are for 30 years he said hed heard 
people say the same thing you cant get good bread in 
washington he said it himself 
so he invested 80000 in savings borrowed more from a bank 
studied baking in france traveled this country to sample loaves 
he imported an oven from france and dispatched two employees to 
spend a month in los angeles learning the craft from nancy 
silverton proprietor of famous la brea bakery whose bread 
furstenberg most wanted to replicate 
business was good even before the washington post discovered 
marvelous market and fell in love 
the newspapers home section wrote about the bread on a 
thursday the food section the following wednesday and restaurant 
reviewer phyllis richman on sunday now washington has 
worldclass bread the new york times also took approving 
notice 
thats when the lines started forming 
one morning last week sylvia mulhauser a visitor from fort 
lauderdale fla was asked if she ever thought shed wait 45 
minutes for bread 
no she said and i never thought id pay 375 for a 
loaf either 
asked why shed do it mrs mulhauser spelled out her reasons 
crunchy chewy flavorful good texture

return with us now to the fictional town of twin peaks where 
nothing is quite what it seems and everyone is out to lunch 
food is still a central theme although this time cherry pie has 
taken a back seat to huckleberries and half of twin peaks 
inhabitants are still playing lifes card game without picture 
cards 
no no one ever came right out and said who killed homecoming 
queen laura palmer during sunday nights twohour season premiere 
of abcs truly bizaare soap opera 
but then no one has ever accused twin peaks creators david 
lynch and mark frost of writing in declarative sentences 
for peaks freaks though sundays second season opener provided 
a host of substantial if sometimes incomprehensible clues to 
palmers murderer 
first things first however 
no pieloving fbi agent dale cooper is not dead despite taking 
three slugs in last seasons cliffhanger ending from an unknown 
assailant at pointblank range 
yes he was wearing a bulletproof vest but it seems a 
bothersome wood tick had caused cooper some discomfort and he had 
hitched up his vest to get at it 
his unprotected abdomen was hit this though did not stop him 
from springing out of his hospital bed to find palmers killer 
it did cause him to see a vision of a giant bathed in white 
light who gave him three clues to the cosmic goingson in twin 
peaks one of the profound nuggets theres a man in a smiling 
bag 
you hate to see that 
the mill did indeed burn to the ground and if you listened to 
the recently released cassette of coopers dictated ramblings to 
his secretary you would have already known that consumate witch 
catherine martell and mysterious widow josie packard are missing 
most of the other wacko residents are in comas or the hospital 
nadine hurley survived her suicide attempt but is comatose and 
the reason she always wears that eye patch is that her husband 
accidentally blinded her in one eye during a hunting trip that 
doubled as their secret honeymoon 
catherines longsuffering husband pete suffered smoke 
inhalation during the sawmill blaze as did shelly johnson 
her wifebeating jerk of a husband leo survived being shot 
but hes in a coma too and may be braindamaged nothing new in 
the latter development 
ok ok back to lauras killer we know now that on the night of 
her death palmer and coworker ronette pulaski eventually ended up 
blindfolded in an orgy with leo and jacques renault who now is 
dead too 
a mysterious longhaired third man showed up at the sexfest and 
beat the blindfolded girls ronette escaped laura obviously 
didnt 
if you had read the xrated make that nc17 secret diary of 
laura palmer written by lynchs 22yearold daughter jennifer 
you also would have known that bob as laura refers to him in her 
diary is most likely the killer 
that is if bob is a real person and not the figment of palmers 
cocaineinduced imagination 
but true to form the season premiere of twin peaks gave 
viewers two things beautiful pictures and an utterly confusing 
script 
sundays episode was directed by lynch and written by frost 
next week it moves to its new regular time period of 10 pm on 
saturdays

this country is on the brink of a famine 
worse than the one that killed hundreds of thousands of africans in 
the mid1980s but the ruling junta refuses to acknowledge the 
threat diplomats and relief officials say 
they say the military governments refusal to declare an 
emergency is preventing the international aid community from 
obtaining and distributing the million tons of food necessary to 
head off the famine 
they say up to 8 million sudanese are at risk and that the 
famine is expected to peak by april some people already are 
starving 
this famine will be worse than the ethiopiansudanese famine 
of 198485 and the conditions to relieve it are 100 times worse 
said a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
us officials in washington say the junta is using food as a 
weapon in its war with southern rebels they accuse it of bombing 
humanitarian relief sites in rebel areas including a red cross 
food barge 
the americans were outraged at a sudanese request last week for 
150 million in food aid 
i think its almost unimaginable that a government facing a 
disaster of epic proportions would have the audacity to bomb food 
shipments at the same time they are asking for more food 
assistance said andrew natsios head of the us office of 
foreign disaster assistance 
half the country is starving to death he said thursday in 
washington that is a recipe for massive political convulsions 
hundreds of thousands of people died in the 198485 famine and 
more than 250000 sudanese died of disease and starvation two years 
ago the 1988 deaths occurred because both sides in sudans civil 
war used the food weapon denying famine relief to people in 
territory controlled by the other side western relief officials 
said 
many of the 26 million sudanese are already suffering 
sudans main staple sorghum is in short supply in many 
markets farmers and nomadic cattle herders are selling off animals 
because drought has destroyed grazing lands and sorghum is 
unavailable or too expensive to feed them 
initial reports by foreign specialists say no fewer than 3 
million people and as many as 8 million will be affected by the 
expected famine 
more than 2 million sudanese are in makeshift camps around 
khartoum more than half are southerners who have sought shelter 
from famine and the 7yearold civil war the rest migrated from 
the kordofan region in the west during the mid1980s drought 
in recent weeks 10000 more some showing clear signs of 
malnutrition have crowded into the camps in a generally fruitless 
search for food 
the threat of famine comes at a particularly bad time much 
regular aid earmarked for lt gen omar hassan elbashirs junta 
has been cut back or stopped because of sudans lack of democracy 
human rights record and political isolation after its support of 
iraqs invasion of kuwait 
natsios and other us officials accused sudanese forces of 
bombing the southern town of bor where international food relief 
operations are under way last week 
other air raids have taken place near un food relief sites 
natsios said 
the presumed purpose of the bombing missions is to prevent the 
rebel sudan peoples liberation army from diverting food meant for 
starving civilians to its fighters like government soldiers in the 
bush war many rebels have lived on subsistence rations during 
their long fight against northern domination 
western relief officials are pressing for government action to 
allow the united nations western donors and relief agencies to get 
a relief campaign under way they say at least 500 million must be 
found to pay for purchase and distribution of a million tons of 
food 
sudans 1989 winter harvest of sorghum and other grains was less 
than half 1988s bumper crop and has not lasted until the next 
harvest expected in november 
the blow that guarantees a new disaster came in july when 
expected summer rains didnt come they began erratically and 
meagerly in september 
with the late rains and insufficient quantities maybe we will 
get only 30 to 40 percent of the crop maybe not even that said 
mukesh sanghavi of the european development and relief agency 
acord 
other western relief officials estimated as little as 10 percent 
of the yield can be realized

if this is monday it must be carlos menem of 
argentina and luis alberto lacalle of uruguay and borisav jovic 
of yugoslavia and the leaders of italy and el salvador and on and 
on 
those are just some of the fellow presidents george bush was 
meeting today on the final leg of his own version of the new york 
marathon 
he saved time sunday for a quick trot through the world summit 
for children at the united nations and a dash back to the white 
house to close a 500 billion budget deal with the leaders of 
congress 
but mostly what he did during three frenetic days was sit in an 
easy chair in his 35th floor suite at the waldorf astoria holding 
court with a score or more of presidents prime ministers and even 
a king 
for all but a special few including prime ministers toshiki 
kaifu of japan and margaret thatcher of great britain it was a 
15minute shot they were ushered in and out of the presidential 
suite almost as fast as the state department protocol squad could 
change the ceremonial flags 
this was no diplomatic minuet it was a break dance a chance 
for bush to strut his stuff with fellow movers and shakers in the 
very hotel he called home two decades ago during his stint as the 
permanent us representative to the united nations 
 
 
 
brian mulroney dropped by saturday evening a late addition to 
the schedule and boasted that more than 70 world leaders were in 
town for the childrens summit which the canadian prime minister 
helped pull together 
did you put the arm on all of them like you did on me 
cracked bush 
bushs heart didnt seem to be in the childrens summit 
he marched in the opening procession with one of his points of 
light 13yearold justin lebo of saddlebrook nj who fixes up 
broken bikes for needy kids and he sat through a halfhour of 
speeches by mulroney and others before barreling through his own 
plodding text 
by then the engines were already idling on presidential 
helicopters and jets waiting to whisk the president back to 
washington to ink the deficit deal the white house tipped 
reporters off that in the interest of saving time bush would not 
read every word 
among the passages that didnt make the final cut two 
references to antoine de saintexuperys classic fable of the 
wisdom and innocence of youth the little prince including an 
admonition against monarchs who issue one pronouncement after 
another all to no effect whatsoever 
but the president did find time to remind the international 
dignitaries that programs can best enhance the welfare of 
children by strengthening the mutual responsibilities of public 
institutions and individual families 
 
 
 
look at that hey how beautiful exclaimed bush when 
nicaraguan president violeta de chamorro presented him with an 
ak47 rifle cut in half with a blow torch and mounted on a frame 
mrs chamorro explained that the sovietmade rifle had been 
confiscated from a civilian and was a symbol of her efforts to help 
democracy take root in postsandinista nicaragua 
but despite bushs effusive remarks she wasnt convinced the 
unusual souvenir was a hit 
i dont know if you really do like the gift she said i 
dont have a silver tray 
i do i do like the gift insisted her host i like this 
better because it does have a message aides said later he has a 
spot in mind for it in a trophy room at camp david 
 
 
 
when colombian president cesar gaviria descended on a cramped 
press room after his teteatete with bush the everefficient 
white house communications agency had a microphone stand ready and 
a multbox that provides reporters with broadcastquality 
audio 
nevertheless many of the colombian press corps eschewed the 
multbox and crowded around the voluble gaviria holding up 
microphones and tape recorders one radio man held up a phone 
getting a beat on his rivals with a direct line back to bogota 
one television reporter apparently had her audio lines plugged 
into the multbox but after eyeing the spectacle of her colleagues 
crowded around gaviria with their company microphones under the 
presidents chin she took her own dummy mike replete with a 
large network logo and thrust it up into the thicket she kept it 
there for 10 minutes taping nothing but showing the company flag

the quest by nancy cruzans family 
for legal permission to let their comatose daughter die could get a 
boost from new evidence and the states desire to get out of the 
case 
missouri attorney general william webster who won a us 
supreme court decision in june preventing removal of the 
33yearold womans feeding tube said in midseptember that the 
state has no recognizable legal interest in the case 
we were in it initially to represent the state hospital 
because there was no law now there is case law as stated by the 
missouri supreme court and upheld by the supreme court he said 
webster also said missouris health director recently signed an 
affidavit saying if the court orders the feeding tube removed the 
state will carry out the directive 
and joe and joyce cruzan said last week that three people are 
willing to testify about discussions with their daughter concerning 
lifesustaining treatment before the 1983 car crash that left her 
in a comalike condition 
they have asked jasper county probate judge charles teel to hear 
the new evidence a hearing is expected to be held in november 
it removes the principal opposition now that they the state 
want out that means there are only two parties left in the family 
and myself it would help them out thad mccanse ms cruzans 
courtappointed attorney 
mccanse wont say what position he will take on the new 
evidence but he had previously urged the courts to side with the 
family 
even so joe cruzan refuses to be optimistic after many 
disappointments including the us supreme courts ruling against 
his family in its first righttodie decision in which it 
ruled 54 that the state could keep a patient on life support in 
the absence of clear and convincing proof that the person would 
want to die 
were just going to wait and see what happens cruzan said 
from his home at carterville well continue trying to do what we 
think is the right thing for us and nancy 
the cruzans visit their daughter weekly at the staterun 
missouri rehabilitation center in mount vernon her body is rigid 
her hands and feet bent into claws she breathes on her own and at 
times her eyes are open and move randomly 
the legal fight began when the parents after realizing their 
daughter would never recover asked doctors to remove the feeding 
tube the doctors refused and in 1987 the family went to teel 
teel ruled for the family in 1988 the missouri supreme court 
overturned that decision five months later the family appealed to 
the us supreme court 
ms cruzan left no written instructions about what she would 
want done under such circumstances the family however had 
testified they were certain about their request based on a 
lifetime of experiences and conversations the young woman had with 
a friend 
the cruzans said three people they wont identify have now come 
forward to say that their daughter had expressed a wish not to be 
kept alive in such fashion 
bill colby an attorney for ms cruzan and her family said the 
new evidence meets the clear and convincing standard 
the attorney general meanwhile said he has asked teel to hold 
a hearing on removing the state health department from the 
litigation the department runs the rehabilitation center no 
hearing date has been set

iraqi ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat is a 
man under siege 
secretary of state james a baker iii refuses to see him he 
usually is summoned not invited to the state department 
calls from capitol hill are few and far between and us 
businessmen shun his complex 
after the united states and iraq engaged in titfortat 
expulsions of diplomats forcing the iraqi embassy to close its 
trade military and press sections mashat found his embassy staff 
of 55 reduced to 16 
this is the most difficult period in our lives the last two 
months mashat 59 said in an interview in his huge 
woodpaneled office 
the walls are decorated with two pictures of his boss saddam 
hussein and a television set is tuned to cable news network a 
shortwave radio sits by his desk 
the atmosphere at the shortstaffed embassy is subdued a 
secretary answers two telephones reporters drop by asking for 
visas to travel to baghdad and iraqi officials chat in arabic on 
couches in the foyer 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 mashat has steadfastly 
defended his countrys action in the face of nearunanimous 
international criticism of the occupation he generally repeats the 
line espoused in baghdad 
in response to iraqs actions mashat has been dressed down 
privately by assistant secretary of state john kelly challenged by 
television interviewers from ted koppel to barbaa walters and in 
essence been called a liar by returning americans who had been 
held hostage in iraq 
when mashat showed up at washington dulles international airport 
to greet a group of returning americans citizens he called them 
guests of his country who had been treated well 
i wasnt a guest retorted 76yearold lloyd culberton of el 
paso texas i damned near starved to death 
he is faced with some difficult problems said marshall 
wiley a former ambassador to iraq who knows mashat even the 
most skilled diplomat would have a tough time 
hes a likeable enough fellow but he is not negotiating or 
trying to improve his countrys situation through his 
personality said a state department official speaking on 
condition he remain anonymous 
diplomats familiar with mashat said he does not have the 
charisma of his predecessor nizar hamdoon who is now iraqs 
deputy foreign minister 
mashat has made frequent appearances on television and he does 
not shy away from the social scene despite the official strains 
between his country and other nations of the world 
he attended for instance an annual blacktie ball for 
diplomats last week sitting at a table near that of gen colin 
powell head of the joint chiefs of staff 
an americaneducated diplomat who served as his countrys 
ambassador in london paris and vienna before he came to the united 
states a year ago mashat is bitter about the us response to the 
invasion of kuwait 
the gulf crisis is an arab problem and solutions should come 
from the arabs he said adding that he views the united 
nationsimposed sanctions on iraq as outrageous 
moreover mashat said iraqs actions are no worse than the us 
military intervention in panama and grenada or the mining of 
nicaraguan harbors in the 1980s 
the americans held against their will in iraq will be released 
as soon as the united states gives written assurances that iraq 
will not be attacked mashat said 
echoing saddams statements mashat also said iraq will never 
fire the first shot but that any provocation by the united 
states to start a war would lead to a prolonged conflict the 
aftereffects of such a conflict would sour usarab relations for 
decades he said 
despite official tensions mashat who was educated at the 
university of california and university of maryland still thinks 
americans like iraqis personally 
as for his future mashat has no plans to leave anytime soon he 
and his wife and three children intend to remain in the nations 
capital until saddam recalls him

mayor alex olejko can look out his office 
window at sea gulls gliding over piles of iron ore a reminder of 
this lake erie ports industrial past 
he also can see the remains of the once bustling american 
shipbuilding co yard that shut down in 1983 
but he has a vision of the mostly barren 54acre site 
transformed into a 300 million casino resort that would spur 
development along the black river and bring jobs to this 
bluecollar city 
he hopes to take the first step toward that dream nov 6 when 
ohio voters decide whether to let lorain hold an election on 
allowing a casino 
if the states voters give their ok and lorain voters follow 
with their own approval the city will become ohios first site for 
an experimental casino if the venture was deemed successful after 
three years the state could eventually have seven other 
casinoresort districts 
the proposed constitutional amendment was put on the ballot by a 
petition drive after the state senate rejected the idea it has 
drawn opposition from religious leaders as well as gov richard 
celeste and the mayors of cleveland cincinnati and columbus 
olejko and other supporters of the plan are trying to focus the 
debate on giving lorain residents the right to decide for 
themselves 
if they dont want to gamble thats fine i dont like to 
gamble either but dont deny me my choice just like if i want to 
have a beer thats my choice thats what america is all about 
freedom of choice the mayor said 
gambling opponents say the right to vote argument is a ploy 
to have the casino issue decided only in lorain where it is most 
likely to pass 
their let us vote campaign uses a slick public relations 
theme to somehow portray that if anyone is against issue 3 they are 
somehow unamerican or unpatriotic said the rev john adams of 
lorain who heads a coalition opposing the casino plan 
colorado and north dakota are among several other states that 
have ballot measures on gambling this year 
colorado voters will decide whether to permit smallstakes 
gambling in three oldtime mining towns cripple creek central 
city and black hawk in north dakota voters are considering 
whether to allow gambling in roland township which includes the 
lake metigoshe resort area 
voters in north dakota also will decide whether to permit video 
gambling machines in bars a similar issue is on the ballot in 
nebraska 
riverboat gambling has been approved in illinois and iowa but 
the illinois law doesnt take effect until january and the iowa 
statute not until april 
voters in gary ind last year endorsed gambling in 
hotelcasino resorts but a bill to allow it died in the 
legislature in march 
elsewhere 
voters in louisiana will decide in saturdays election whether 
to have a lottery 
supporters of an arkansas lottery gathered enough signatures 
to put the issue on the nov 6 ballot but opponents have gone to 
court to try to get the question removed 
new jersey residents will vote on permitting sunday horse 
racing 
voters in trousdale county tenn will decide whether to 
become the second locality in that state to legalize horse racing 
memphis voters previously approved it but no license has been 
issued for a track 
in lorain olejko a former steelworker said the casinohotel 
would be a great tourist destination and would create 3000 to 
7000 jobs 
lorains steel and auto industries are prone to severe setbacks 
when the nations economy slumps and the mayor said employment has 
been declining over the years at lorains ford assembly plant and 
the former usx lorain works now the usskobe japan joint 
venture 
the citys population estimated at 80000 in 1980 has fallen 
to about 75000 
adams pastor of lake breeze revival center a 
nondenominational church said his opposition is not based on 
religious or moral values 
casinos dont deliver what they promise plain and simple 
he said there is a certain element of wanting something for 
nothing that comes along with pulling the handle of a slot machine 
or making a bet people may think they will get a lot more out of 
it than they actually do get

if you smoke drive or drink the proposed 
budget agreement will hit you where it hurts one congressional 
leader says but even if you dont do any of those things youll 
still feel the pain 
elderly or disabled medicare recipients will pay higher 
premiums 
students will see their federal loan program reduced 
farmers would lose 13 billion in agricultural subsidies 
among the other intended effects higher taxes for families 
moving up from toyota to mercedes less opportunity for low income 
families who depend on subsidized housing and for high income 
taxpayers whose accountants look for every possible deduction 
jobless americans would wait longer to receive their initial 
unemployment benefits 
the bush administration believes the 500 billion in tough tax 
and spending measures prescribed in sundays agreement with 
congressional leaders is necessary as a means of denting the 
federal deficit 
in terms of pocketbook impact nothing can be more important 
to every american men and women who are either alone or who have 
families they have to care for than the overall economic 
climate said white house chief of staff john sununu 
the budget negotiators sununu included believe that after 
the yelps of protest die down their budget agreement will pass 
congress and have a positive effect helping the average american 
by spurring the economy enough to let interest rates drop and 
businesses prosper 
whether the package even if enacted in full will ever have 
that effect is uncertain there are too many question marks 
ranging from the whims of foreign investors to the price other 
countries demand for oil to predict how the us economy will 
behave 
but while the countrys economic doctors wait for the 
prescription to take effect americans of all classes are being 
asked to bear a part of the pain 
some of the major elements of the fiveyear budget plan were 
best summed up by senate minority leader bob dole rkan who 
said if you smoke drive or drink youre going to pay a little 
more 
cigarette taxes will gradually grow from the current 16 cents 
per pack to 24 cents 
the tax on a sixpack of beer will go from 16 cents to 36 cents 
a gallon of hard liquor will be taxed 1370 up 120 from today 
the levy on table wine will grow from 3 cents to 24 cents per 
bottle 
gasoline now taxed by the federal government at 9 cents per 
gallon will eventually carry a 21centpergallon levy 
if you fly the federal tax you pay on your airline tickets will 
grow from 8 percent to 10 percent 
fancy cars private boats furs and jewelry will be taxed 
another 10 percent above price thresholds for each item boat 
owners also will be assessed a 25 annual fee to help cover the 
coast guards costs of patrolling the waterways 
people who earn more than 100000 annually will lose 3 percent 
of their deductions above that amount 
uppermiddleclass wage earners will notice higher taxes taken 
out of their paychecks too the 145 percent tax that helps support 
the medicare program which is now applied to only the first 
51300 of income will now be subtracted for the first 73000 
medicare recipients the nations elderly and disabled will 
be paying more and getting less their 2860 monthly premium for 
doctors care will cost about 3430 and they will have to pay the 
first 150 of doctors bills themselves double the current 
deductible 
farmers will see the programs that support them cut by 13 
billion over the five years federal retirees now allowed to take 
in a lump sum a portion of their pension funds will lose that 
option 
the government will get tougher on students who default on 
guaranteed student loans veterans programs will be reduced as 
well

here are excerpts from a translation of 
iraqi president saddam husseins address to moslems on sunday 
carried on iraqi state television and radio on the occasion of the 
birthday of the prophet mohammed 
 
we have said on more than one occasion that the infidels have 
not carried out aggression against the people of faith in iraq 
because of the events that took place after aug 2 their 
aggressive actions took place long before aug 2 even the american 
decision to impose a bread embargo on iraq began before aug 2 
besides even before aug 2 there was talk in america and europe 
of exploring ways of boycotting iraq 
this provides enough documented evidence that they harbored 
aggressive intentions using the pretext of what they called iraqs 
dangerous and growing military might its developing industry and 
the military industrialization of our country and our remark on 
april 4 in response to aggressive postures and statements that 
whoever strikes at iraq or any other arabs we will hit back 
strongly these statements were cover by the west for aggression in 
the form of political informational and economic actions 
after the criminals realized that all these aggressive actions 
had not prevented iraq from its program to call for and demand the 
liberation of palestine narrow the gap between the poor and the 
rich and use oil within a humanitarian and rational policy they 
pushed the croesus of kuwait and his supporters the backward sheiks 
in kuwait and other places to play their shameless treacherous role 
in plotting against iraq and to weaken it with the aim of 
achieving their disappointed aspirations 
instead of relinquishing our principles the honor involved in 
the right and responsible position and the great iraqi peoples 
role the blow was directed at the croesus of kuwait and his 
supporters and by this defensive and revolutionary measure which 
achieved an unprecedented success with the help of god the usurped 
right of faithful iraq was restored a right on which the throne of 
corruption had been established until kuwait had been deprived of 
any light during the past period 
the infidel people and the enemies of the arab nation who 
betrayed the arab nation went out of their mind and realized that 
the punishment inflicted on those who appeared on the stage of 
hostility to the line of faith and struggle to liberate palestine 
would increase the ability of faith and the faithful and help 
spread right and diminish the influence of falsehood therefore 
armies and fleets came from every evil corner led by the haven of 
evil in the united states instead of learning the lesson of aug 2 
to stay away from plans and measures preceding the event they 
began as usual with those who fall into the abyss and whose 
behavior is dominated by satan and grudge to increase their forces 
and commit another crime against god his messenger and the 
faithful by occupying the land of the arab and moslem sanctities in 
the arabian peninsula and the arabian gulf 
the iraqi armed forces will be prepared to stay alert ready to 
face any eventuality and prepared to defend the province of kuwait 
the same way it would defend any other province in the country 
the arab solution can only be achieved in an atmosphere of good 
arab relations since good arab relations cannot be conceived in 
the presence of foreign forces on arab lands and moslem holy places 
and under threats these forces must go 
should the international community be involved in a solution to 
the crisis then the emphasis should be on the initiative of aug 
12 1990 which underlined that peace could not be achieved 
without the settlement of all problems of the region 
withdrawal of foreign forces from the lands of najd and hejaz 
saudi arabia and the arabian gulf and ending the blockade of 
iraq is a slogan for all arabs and believers to raise 
in all cases we must encourage every foreign move including 
those made by those who were involved in amassing the fleets to 
retreat without bargaining over our objectives and principles we 
should also regard any retreat that is based on the fact that the 
picture was not clear at the beginning as a virtue for those who 
make this retreat therefore we view the speech of the french 
president despite certain reservations as being of a different 
language and we hope our positive interpretation is correct 
difference in opinion does not annoy us what annoys us is the 
grudgefilled baseless accusations by certain leaders unwilling to 
discuss our perceptions and interpretations 
it is not important to agree or disagree with this initiative or 
that including that of french president mitterrand what is 
important is that a serious dialogue be launched in search of a 
possible just and comprehensive solution that would allow peace to 
prevail and lay solid foundations for the future of the concerned 
people of the region that are not shaken by circumstantial changes 
we intend to launch contact with the french government with the 
aim of formulating a precise viewpoint so that action could 
be launched on clear and solid foundations 
our main concern is that the situation that prevailed before 
aug 2 on all levels may not be repeated that palestine returns to 
its people the palestinians so they can set up their independent 
state and the foreign occupation forces depart from the land of 
najd hejaz saudi arabia and the gulf without any conditions

sen john kerrys reelection bid has suddenly 
turned into a dogfight with republican challenger james rappaport 
who is trying to capitalize on a wave of voter anger with 
established democrats 
only a few days after winning the gop nomination last month 
rappaport fired off a hes baaaaack television advertisement 
painting kerry as a clone of gov michael dukakis 
jim rappaport obviously wants to use mike dukakis to hide the 
fact that he doesnt have a record and that hes unwilling to run 
against me on my record responds kerry 
until recently many political observers did not give rappaport 
a 34yearold real estate developer much of a chance of unseating 
kerry who is completing his first term 
but that changed after the sept 18 primary voters ousted many 
highprofile politicians showing frustration with a 
democratcontrolled state government that has been mired in fiscal 
hardship since dukaki lost the 1988 presidential race 
rappaport seeking public office for the first time has seized 
on this antiincumbency mood and after spending 17 million of 
his own money on the primary he has shown the financial ability to 
wage an allout battle 
the combination of these factors has turned the race into a 
virtual dead heat in recent public opinion polls 
this one wasnt on the radar screen a few weeks ago said 
stuart rothenberg publisher of the political report a washington 
dc newsletter that monitors congressional elections 
the race has gained more prominence in the eyes of the national 
republican senatorial committee which now considers massachusetts 
one of its top prospects for defeating a democratic incumbent said 
wendy burnley spokeswoman for the committee 
republicans for months have believed the political climate in 
massachusetts made kerry vulnerable but officials took a 
waitandsee attitude until after the primary burnley said 
once the primary was over once the voters in the strongest 
terms possible made their views known certainly massachusetts 
became a top race burnley said 
that will mean more money for rappaport the senatorial 
committee intends to spend the maximum amount of money allowable on 
rappaports behalf which will total about 460000 burnley said 
in addition the committee will contribute 17500 directly to his 
campaign also the maximum amount 
one of rappaports main tactics has been to link kerry with 
dukakis calling him a philosophical twin of the unpopular 
governor a recent campaign ad showed dukakis face slowly 
transforming into a picture of kerry 
kerry 46 who served as lieutenant governor under dukakis for 
two years before winning the senate seat has tried to fend off 
these attacks he said that when he left for washington the state 
government was in sound shape also kerry noted that he was an 
early supporter of the grammrudman act to control the federal 
deficit 
but rappaport says kerrys responsibility toward the state did 
not disappear when he entered the senate 
as a leader what he should have done was challenge the 
leadership in this state to get spending under control rappaport 
said 
former democratic sen paul tsongas who gave up the seat kerry 
won said he thinks the attempts to link kerry and dukakis are 
too cute 
were talking about the us senate not a race for the 
legislature he said 
some political analysts suggest rappaport must continue to 
define the race as a referendum on kerry and the democrats rather 
than a headtohead matchup 
chris greeley political director for kerry said the campaign 
will try to point out inconsistencies in rappaports background 
such as his opposition to farm subsidies even though his familys 
dairy farm in vermont received such assistance 
rappaport says he would give up that money if kerry would stop 
accepting subsidies through franking privileges that allow him 
to send mail to voters 
but kerry is hitting back with his own ads 
if you live by the sword you die by the sword the senator 
said recently 
one of his recent radio commercials says rappaport knows vermont 
and hawaii where he has had other business interests but jim 
rappaport doesnt know diddly about massachusetts 
i think massachusetts voters are rational voters greeley 
said yes they are angry but that is not to suggest the anger 
will make it possible for any candidate for any office to receive 
their support

boston celtics rookie dee brown forced 
from a car by police and ordered to lie on the ground at gunpoint 
in a case of mistaken identity is thinking twice about moving to 
this wealthy mostly white suburb 
the basketball teams top draft choice is black 21 and fresh 
out of jacksonville state in florida where he heard of bostons 
reputation for racism 
when you think of towns up north and you think of racism you 
think of boston brown said 
wellesley police converged on brown and his fiancee who is 
white as they sat in a parked car sept 21 across from a bank that 
had been robbed of about 1700 a few days before 
police arrived after a bank employee saw brown and reported he 
could be the robber brown who is 61 said he was forced from the 
car by at least five officers told to lie face down on the 
pavement and had guns pointed at his head before his identity was 
confirmed and the two were freed 
its always going to be in the back of my head he said 
brown had his eyes on a 100yearold victorian house in this 
boston suburb of about 26000 but he said he may not complete the 
deal despite apologies from police chief john fritts and some 
residents 
black white no one should be subject to that kind of 
harassment brown said i have to dig deep and look at if i 
love this town or not 
the incident has raised anew questions about racism in the 
boston area a year after black neighborhoods were descended upon 
by police searching for the killer of pregnant carol stuart in what 
later turned out to be a hoax concocted by her husband charles 
charles stuart apparently jumped to his death in the boston harbor 
after his story began to unravel 
i think police harassment is something that happens often i 
think it got the press that it did because brown is a boston celtic 
player said louis elisa director of the boston chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people 
a black former celtic bill russell took a direct approach to a 
similar problem in the 1950s 
russell who was named the nbas greatest player ever and played 
for the celtics for 13 years beginning in 1956 said in his 
autobiography that he was harassed several times by police he 
chose to make his family the only black household in reading a 
suburb north of boston 
barbara shanahan chairman of the wellesley board of selectmen 
said browns treatment by police is under investigation if the 
board determines police are not sensitive to blacks programs on 
ethnic and cultural understanding will be started she said 
brown hopes his wellesley experience will open the eyes of 
people in boston that racial tension is here 
you try to make boston wellesley anywhere you want to live 
a better place he said 
shanahan said she hopes brown makes his home in wellesley 
i guess im hoping that it would be a recognition on his 
part that this is a community that will welcome him and will be a 
good community for him to live in she said

the leader of angolas usbacked rebels says 
he believes peace negotiations with the countrys leftist 
government are so far advanced that a ceasefire is likely within 
the next three months 
we feel the climate is favorable by the end of the year 
jonas savimbi head of the unita rebels said in an interview he 
based his optimism on the last round of negotiations with 
government representatives which ended thursday in portugal 
savimbi outlined his thoughts to two american reporters on 
sunday at the start of a weeklong round of official talks and 
media appearances he meets with president bush on tuesday 
the veteran guerrilla leader seemed more upbeat about peace 
prospects than at any time since he took up arms against portuguese 
colonial rule 25 years ago he and his followers have been waging a 
bloody civil war against the sovietbacked government for 15 years 
savimbi said it should be possible for free elections to be held 
in angola by the end of 1991 if all goes according to plan but he 
said the process could be upset if congress denies his forces 
additional aid 
if aid to unita is put in doubt then this is going to hamper 
tremendously the negotiating process he said the us 
assistance provided covertly is believed to average about 60 
million annually 
savimbi said his purpose here is not to discuss aid but that 
issue is certain to arise in his talks on capitol hill 
angolan government officials have said that previous 
justifications for continued us aid to unita have disappeared 
among other actions these officials noted that cuban troops 
have been leaving the country at a rate of about 1500 a month and 
angola has agreed to a multiparty democracy and to a free market 
economy 
there also have been repeated allegations that savimbi runs 
unita with an iron fist dealing ruthlessly with potential rivals 
unita has denied the allegations 
the government has also charged that unita attacks in the 
countryside have displaced more than 1 million people 
paulo tuba a member of an opposition party who nonetheless 
supports the governments negotiating position said last week that 
us aid to unita should be suspended 
continued aid to unita is not conducive to a peace 
settlement he said 
savimbi cited as evidence of progress the presence for the first 
time of american and soviet representatives at the last round of 
peace talks the two superpowers have been at odds over angola for 
many years sending arms to rival sides 
another plus savimbi said was that there were more extensive 
discussions than ever before on ground rules for a ceasefire 
he acknowledged that the angolan government has been more 
flexible than before because circumstances forced a change 
angolan authorities he said realize that a doctrinaire marxist 
approach is no longer sustainable at a time when prosoviet regimes 
elsewhere are collapsing under popular pressure 
savimbi said once the angolan government extends to unita 
political recognition and a ceasefire is reached the rebel forces 
can relocate to internationally monitored enclaves during the 
process leading up to the election of a national government 
there is no military solution he said only a political 
solution

mammograms would be cheaper and perhaps more 
effective in preventing breast cancer deaths if the united states 
did not have as many mammography machines researchers reported 
today 
the researchers from the national institutes of health and the 
food and drug administration reported in the annals of internal 
medicine that the country has 3 times more mammography machines 
than it needs 
martin l brown of the national cancer institute the reports 
lead author said the high number of the xray screening devices 
reduces the number of patients per machine keeping costs high 
and with so many facilities using the machnnes its unlikely 
they can afford the recordkeeping and followup care that make 
mammography useful in preventing deaths from breast cancer he 
said 
an accompanying editorial by dr alvin mushlin of the university 
of rochester medical center also warned that the oversupply of 
mammography units may ultimately lead to a situation in which 
more care does not mean better care and it certainly is unlikely 
to mean more costeffective care 
researchers estimate that each year 150000 american women 
develop breast cancer and 44000 die of the disease 
breast cancer rates could be lowered about 30 percent if women 
received mammograms as recommended by the national cancer 
institute according to earlier studies about onethird of women 
eligible get regular screenings the centers for disease control 
reported 
although an estimated 10000 mammography machines were installed 
by 1990 the actual need is only about 2600 the authors said 
if doctors lowered the average cost of a screening test from 
100 to 50 by using fewer machines the country could save 763 
million a year in health costs brown said

the long gray row of rundown tenements on 
east berlins mainzer street drips with communist flags and defiant 
banners a splash of color dedicated to the demise of germany 
radical leftists have taken over 12 of the 20 abandoned 
apartment houses on the street part of a bleak workingclass 
district just east of the city center 
for many of the hundreds of people in this squatters commune 
the unification of germany on wednesday is a call to battle 
it depends on the police it depends on the fascists it 
depends on what happens that day said a west berliner who only 
identified himself as tommy he was designated as spokesman when a 
reporter visited on sunday 
im quite scared that germany coming together is already 
turning germany against foreigners against leftist people he 
said you wont find anyone on this street saying yeah a big 
strong germany 
radicals and police alike say violent clashes have become a grim 
probability on the night before and the day of german unity 
police have beefed up their presence noticeably especially at 
historical sites designated for unity day celebrations 
east german interior minister petermichael diestel a 
lawandorder advocate declared sunday that police should act 
with decisiveness against radical occurrences 
west berlin interior minister erich paetzold warned of an 
alarming security situation in east berlin in a message to that 
citys police 
but he urged east germanys police to use restraint and to avoid 
letting confrontations escalate 
diestel said safeguarding the official unification events is a 
matter of extreme urgency 
east berlin has become a cauldron of extremist violence by 
neonazi skinheads selfdescribed hooligans and leftwing 
radicals 
the groups frequently stage attacks on each other 
not far from mainzer street neonazi skinheads have taken over 
a large apartment house 
the city government has said it is up to the federal police to 
remove them while the federal government says it has no evidence 
to link such groups to attacks 
much of the burgeoning leftist scene in east berlin has been 
nurtured by the veteran radicals in west berlin who stage 
firebomband rockthrowing riots every may 1 the international 
labor day 
much of the rightwing violence is prompted by a resentment of 
foreigners and is aimed at the large turkish vietnamese and 
mozambican populations in berlin 
east berlins vast main square alexanderplatz has become a 
focal point for such clashes on any given night groups of young 
turks warily share territory with rightist skinheads and apolitical 
young people who label themselves hooligans 
on friday night hundreds of hooligans clashed with police on 
alexanderplatz and 15 were arrested 
three days earlier 200 leftist radicals wearing ski masks 
slowly marched down east berlins leipziger street stopped at a 
grocery story that has been trying desperately to compete with a 
new west german chain outlet nearby and destroyed its glass facade 
with iron bars and rocks 
they walked slowly away while stunned pedestrians watched 
remaining shards of glass crash sporadically to the ground no 
explanation was offered for their choice of target 
the leftists say they are united in opposition to what they say 
will be a rightwing germany that is a threat to peace and to 
people from third world countries 
in leaflets and conversations they have dubbed unity day 
action day and have scheduled protests to counter the official 
celebrations 
they have scheduled a main demonstration against racism and 
german megalomania for wednesday 
just dont bring a camera you like grinned one of the 
leftists on mainzer street 
the man who identified himself said his group wants peace and is 
trying to build relations with other people in the neighborhood 
but he would not rule out violence at the demonstrations scheduled 
in the coming days 
he said the group has been occupying the block on mainzer since 
april and is negotiating with the city to stay while it renovates 
the buildings 
he said half of the people living there are west germans 
east berlins government has been reluctant to evict squatters 
because of the dire housing shortage 
the whine of drills and circular sanders filled the air along 
mainzer street on sunday huge banners called for a dissolution of 
germany and installation of a state based on anarchy 
east german communist flags fluttered from window ledges and 
hundreds of slogans were painted across each facade

selling by individual investors trying to cover 
margin requirements drove down share prices monday on the tokyo 
stock exchange briefly driving them under 20000 points for the 
first time in more than three years 
meanwhile the dollar fell moderately against the japanese yen 
during monday trading 
the closely watched nikkei stock average of 225 issues briefly 
fell below 20000 points shortly after the afternoon session began 
but a lastminute buying spree stimulated by rumors that the 
ministry of finance would announce new market support measures 
pushed the nikkei up to 2022186 down 76164 points or 363 
percent from its friday finish 
a total of 400 million shares changed hands during monday 
trading 
the decline brought the nikkei average to nearly half its value 
at the end of last year when it peaked at 3891587 points 
the dollar closed at 13715 yen down 080 yen from its friday 
close the us currency fluctuated between 13700 yen and 13788 
yen 
in bond dealings the price of benchmark no 119 10year 
government bonds rose to 8139 points by 3 pm from 8075 friday 
their yields were at 8530 percent down from 8690 
on the stock market traders briefly bought the nikkei average 
to cover short or oversold positions said kazuhiro nomura a 
trader with new japan securities co 
but internal technical factors accentuated the selling mood and 
sent the market barometer tumbling over 700 points by the end of 
the morning session he said 
financial issues were sold monday to make up for artificial 
gains friday from institutional buying aimed at midfiscal year 
window dressing 
hightech issues however were sought by bargain hunters 
traders said 
investors are still trying to determine when share prices will 
hit bottom said a dealer with nikko securities co but they do 
not seem to agree about where the bottom line is yet 
in exchange dealings dealers said trading was mixed on news of 
a budget settlement in the united states that might lead to lower 
interest rates as well as rumors that iraq might be willing to 
negotiate a compromise in the middle east 
toru kanai an exchange analyst also with new japan securities 
said those factors led to dollar selling that brought the us 
currency as low as 13720 during early trading 
but the instability of the tokyo equities market limited the 
yens strength against the dollar he said

president roh taewoo said today that 
the establishment of diplomatic ties with moscow signals an end to 
cold war on the bitterly divided korean peninsula and could lead to 
reunification in a decade 
the soviet ties with south korea were announced sunday the same 
day moscow said it was upgrading relations with israel to the 
consular level 
consular relations are a level below full diplomatic relations 
the announcement of formal sovietsouth korean relations made 
b the countries foreign ministers in new york is considered a 
major diplomatic blow to north korea there was no immediate 
comment from its communist government 
roh said the new ties between moscow and seoul will make it 
impossible for north korea alone to resist the tidal wave of 
change sweeping the world 
north korea had vigorously lobbied moscow long a major ally and 
arms provider against establishing relations with south korea 
but the soviets are no longer able to afford extensive foreign 
aid and are eager for enhanced trade and economic ties with seoul 
the formal establishment of ties culminates a twoyear effort by 
roh to develop trade and diplomatic ties with communist and 
socialist allies of north korea in hopes of easing tension on the 
peninsula 
sundays move is also expected to give south korea more leverage 
in its bid to join the united nations as a full member separately 
from north korea 
in his speech today roh said it was an opportunity for the 
rigid and totalitarian north to open its doors 
clearly the north has reached the deadend of its 
isolationist policy roh told 50000 spectators at an armed 
forces day review of troops interkorean relations are thus 
approaching a major turning point 
the cold war structure on the korean peninsula has begun to 
change he said it is becoming feasible to achieve peaceful 
unification before the present century is out 
the koreas were divided at the end of world war ii and fought 
the korean war from 1950 to 1953 they are technically still at 
war but have in recent months been engaged in dialogue that has 
for the first time included meetings at the prime ministerial 
level 
last week the north opened talks with japan on improving 
relations a move widely seen as an effort to counter seouls ties 
to the norths longtime allies 
south korea is expected to open trade offices with china by the 
end of the year it has established relations with every east 
european nation except albania 
in announcing ties with the soviets in new york foreign 
minister choi hojoong said a soviet trade and economic delegation 
would visit seoul next month to discuss broad economic cooperation 
he said he hoped china will also soon establish full diplomatic 
ties with south korea 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said we believe 
that establishing diplomatic relations between the soviet union and 
south korea will aid the cause of stability in asia and the pacific 
region 
in todays speech roh said the fact that our relations with 
moscow are normalized is spurring change in the security 
situation on the korean peninsula also 
he cautioned however that south koreas 600000 troops must 
remain vigilant 
the soviets and israelis said in new york on sunday that they 
would be opening consulates in each others countries a major 
step in restoring relations severed after the 1967 middle east war 
israel seized territory from moscows arab allies during that 
conflict 
shevardnadze and israels foreign minister david levy told 
reporters they intend to start meeting regularly and that the 
foreign ministries of the kremlin and the jewish state will be in 
regular contact 
shevardnadze said israel would open a consulategeneral the 
highest level consulate in moscow and the soviets would open a 
consulategeneral in tel aviv 
yossi ahimeir a spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said in jerusalem that direct airline flights between the 
soviet union and israel will begin within a month 
such flights could accelerate the exodus of soviet jews to 
israel which is already straining to accommodate more than 100000 
soviet emigres who arrived since last year

six dozen kings presidents and prime 
ministers have concluded what was billed as historys largest 
international summit with a pledge to create a healthier safer and 
more caring planet for children 
the task is daunting 
organizers estimate that even during the twoday weekend summit 
54000 children died from preventable illnesses and hunger 
the gathering sought to mobilize governments to save up to 100 
million children from death by disease and malnutrition in the 
1990s 
the leaders unanimously adopted a 1700word declaration to 
combat poverty disease hunger illiteracy aids and drugs they 
also vowed to grant children first claim on earths resources in 
peace or war 
prime minister brian mulroney of canada one of six leaders who 
10 months ago proposed the summit told sundays closing session 
in the un general assembly chamber that the declaration and its 
plan of action represent the promise of world leaders to 
succeeding generations 
a better world for children is within our reach but not 
yet within our grasp success will depend on the deaths we 
prevent the number of lives we improve it is time to match our 
words with action 
officials at the summit estimated that achieving the 
declarations goals would cost billions of dollars and there was 
no specific pledge of funds 
the accord gives no monetary figure and relies on the good will 
of nations for contributions 
louis sullivan us secretary of health and human services 
initialed the declaration for the united states although bush 
administration officials last week voiced some reservations 
their reluctance about endorsing the declaration had stemmed 
from its call for nations to ratify the 1989 un convention on the 
rights of the child the united states has not signed that accord 
which american conservatives oppose because it does not define the 
fetus as a child with rights and because it bans the death penalty 
for those under 18 
president bush who attended the summit on sunday said that 
this month the us government will announce ambitious new 
objectives for the year 2000 reducing infant mortality and low 
birth weight increasing immunization and improving the health of 
mothers and children 
the final declaration read by six youngsters from around the 
world pledges to combat disease and child labor to promote family 
planning universal education and breast feeding 
its plan of action establishes these goals 
reducing child mortality below age 5 by onethird or to 70 per 
1000 births 
cutting maternal mortality rates by half 
reducing malnutrition among children under 5 by half 
assuring universal access to safe drinking water 
providing universal access to basic education with 80 percent 
of primary students finishing school 
cutting adult illiteracy by half 
protecting children in times of war 
a clause was added to the declaration at kuwaits urging 
denouncing the suffering of children because of aggression 
foreign occupation and annexation no specific countries were 
named iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel who was imprisoned by the 
former comunist regime in his country said evil often has been 
committed in the name of children from the days of adolf hitler 
to those of iraqi president saddam hussein 
thousands of times i have heard people defending their 
servitude to a hated regime by the argument that they were doing it 
only for their children havel told the assembly 
in her speech british prime minister margaret thatcher 
emphasized the importance of the family and urged parents to give 
their children time affection and wise counsel 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu twice his countrys 
education minister said universal education provided the 
foundation for japans economic success he said public school 
teachers should enjoy extra pay and status 
there should be no more argument as to which should come first 
economic development or education kaifu said 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela emphasized the 
problems of homeless children child refugees delinquents and 
child laborers in latin america 
he said the international financial community must realize that 
difficult conditions of international debt repayment have 
intolerable consequences for children 
in his speech to the summit bush declared we are gathered to 
speak for the children of the earth 
let us affirm in this historic summit that these children can 
be saved when we live up to our responsibilities as a world 
community of adults of parents

4 each day countless children around the world are exposed to 
dangers that hamper their growth and development they suffer 
immensely as casualties of war and violence as victims of racial 
discrimination apartheid aggression foreign occupation and 
annexation as refugees and displaced children forced to abandon 
their homes and their roots as disabled or as victims of neglect 
cruelty and exploitation 
5 each day millions of children suffer from the scourges of 
poverty and economic crisis from hunger and homelessness from 
epidemics and illiteracy from degradation of the environment they 
suffer from the grave effects of the problems of external 
indebtedness and also from the lack of sustained and sustainable 
growth in many developing countries particularly the least 
developed ones 
6 each day 40000 children die from malnutrition and disease 
including acquired immune deficiency syndrome from the lack of 
clean water and inadequate sanitation and from the effects of the 
drug problem 
7 these are challenges that we as political leaders must 
meet 
8 together our nations have the means and the knowledge to 
protect the lives and to diminish enormously the suffering of 
children to promote the full development of their human potential 
and to make them aware of their needs rights and opportunities 
9 recent improvements in the international political climate 
can facilitate this task through international cooperation and 
solidarity it should now be possible to achieve concrete results 
in many fields to revitalize economic growth and development to 
protect the environment to prevent the spread of fatal and 
crippling diseases and to achieve greater social and economic 
justice the current moves towards disarmament also mean that 
significant resources could be realized for purposes other than 
military ones improving the wellbeing of children must be a very 
high priority when these resources are reallocated

10 enhancement of childrens health and nutrition is a first 
duty and also a task for which solutions are now within reach the 
lives of tens of thousands of boys and girls can be saved every 
day because the causes of their death are readily preventable 
child and infant mortality is unacceptably high in many parts of 
the world but can be lowered dramatically with means that are 
already known and easily accessible 
11 further attention care and support should be accorded to 
disabled children as well as to other children in very difficult 
circumstances 
12 strengthening the role of women in general and ensuring 
their equal rights will be to the advantage of the worlds 
children girls must be given equal treatment and opportunities 
from the very beginning 
13 at present over 100 million children are without basic 
schooling and two thirds of them are girls the provision of basic 
education and literacy for all are among the most important 
contributions that can be made to the development of the worlds 
children 
14 half a million mothers die each year fromn causes related to 
childbirth safe motherhood must be promoted in all possible ways 
emphasis must be placed on responsible planning of family size and 
child spacing the family as a fundamental group and natural 
environment for the growth and wellbeing of children should be 
given all necessary protection and assistance 
15 all children must be given the chance to find their identity 
and realize their worth in a safe and supportive environment 
through families and all other caregivers committed to their 
welfare they must be prepared for responsible life in a free 
society they should from their early years be encouraged to 
participate in the cultural life of their societies 
16 economic conditions will continue to influence greatly the 
fate of children especially in developing nations for the sake of 
the future of all children it is urgently necessary to ensure or 
reactivate sustained and sustainable economic growth and 
development in all countries and also to continue to give urgent 
attention to an early broad and durable solution to the external 
debt problems facing developing debtor countries 
17 these tasks require a continued and concerted effort by all 
nations through national action and international cooperation

unidentified gunmen raided and burned 
down a a prosandinista radio stations transmission tower on the 
eve of planned demonstrations against the government of president 
violeta chamorro 
the radio station manager william grisby estimated damages at 
more than 200000 he did not speculate on who carried out 
sundays attack 
grisby a sandinista and deputy in the national assembly has 
had public differences in recent weeks with some sandinista 
leaders 
his station la primerisima is a cooperative that follows the 
political line of the opposition sandinista national liberation 
front the sandinistas have been increasingly at odds with the 
government in past weeks 
the leftist sandinistas governed nicaragua until april when 
they were succeeded by mrs chamorros usbacked coalition 
her forces beat the sandinistas in february elections that 
signalled an end to a nineyear insurgency by ussupported contra 
rebels

a state law requiring hospitals and clinics 
to arrange for the burial or cremation of aborted fetuses instead 
of flushing them into the sewer system became effective today 
the measure considered the nations strictest was strongly 
opposed by medical groups which contended that it added costs and 
risks to disposal abortion rights advocates charged it might have 
a chilling effect on women considering an abortion 
i think it says that in minnesota we regard the remains of 
unborn babies with dignity and not something to be thrown down the 
sewer system said brian gibson director of prolife action 
ministries of the twin cities 
gibsons group helped initiate the law by exhibiting an aborted 
fetus it said came from a clinics garbage container the clinic 
denied it 
dave feinwachs general counsel for the minnesota hospital 
association complained that the law makes illegal the common 
sanitary practice of flushing fetal tissue into the sewer system 
storing tissue in barrels of formaldehyde and trucking it 
around is just plain stupid he said 
thomas webber executive director of planned parenthood of 
minnesota said the law is designed to give the inference that 
the state of minnesota is saying to women you just committed 
murder you just killed a little person 
the law also prohibits the burning of fetal tissue in hospital 
incinerators another common disposal method the law applies to 
miscarriages as well as induced abortions it carries up to 90 days 
in jail and a 700 fine 
planned parenthood sued to block the 1987 law contending it was 
vague and would stifle abortions by adding costs and psychological 
trauma a federal judge agreed in 1989 but a federal appeals court 
overruled him in august 
rebecca palmer a planned parenthood laywer said the group 
decided against appealing to the us supreme court because of the 
high courts 1989 decision giving states greater leeway to restrict 
abortion 
laws regulations or city ordinances in at least 15 other states 
have called for special disposal of fetal remains said thomas 
strahan of the rutherford institute in charlottesville va a 
nonprofit legal services organization 
but some of those laws were struck down as unconstitutional and 
others do not have penalties or are too vague to be enforced he 
said 
minnesotas law is the most comprehensive and definitive 
strahan said 
hospitals and abortion clinics have complained to the health 
department that some funeral homes and cemeteries have refused to 
take fetal remains fearing pickets from antiabortion groups 
dan mcinerney deputy state health commissioner said his 
department will approve alternatives only when burial and cremation 
prove impossible to obtain 
weve been advising our members to cooperate said gary 
larson executive director of the minnesota funeral directors 
association but on the other hand a funeral home is not 
responsible for handling fetal tissue we are in business to 
provide funerals for families of people who die 
dale carlson president of the minnesota association of cemetery 
officials denied there is any widespread opposition to taking 
fetuses 
its really not for us to pick and choose or question how they 
specimens for burial got to that point he said 
minnesota averages 16000 to 17000 abortions annually and 
feinwachs said it is unclear how many miscarriages there are its 
also unclear what the additional costs will be 
whatever it is its a waste of money because its 
unnecessary he said now we are faced with the very sensitive 
dilemma of telling them women who have miscarried that theres 
this extra cost for a funeral

over desk work would be hired under recommendations to be unveiled

the mayors in response to a string of shootings many of them 
involving children hit by stray bullets 
we the people dinkins said when asked who would pay for the 
plan

would cost between 500 million and 1 billion 
the payroll tax would start at 01 percent of a workers 
adjusted gross income next year and go to 015 percent the year 
after that 
the tax which requires approval by the legislature would cost 
a worker earning 50000 in adjusted gross income 50 next year and 
75 in subsequent years employers would have to match the amount 
their workers paid the new york times said today 
dinkins said friday that hiring more police officers will

intelligent reasonable responsible way to concerns about crime 
dinkins has insisted on waiting for browns recommendations

remained in serious but stable condition today at lds hospitals

pope john paul ii has opened a worldwide 
synod of bishops to address such questions as how to persuade more 
men to become priests without abandoning rules demanding that they 
be celibate and forsake marriage 
the monthlong synod on the priesthood is to focus on the problem 
of burnout among the churchs shepherds challenges to 
celibacy and the dwindling number of candidates interested in the 
priesthood 
the pontiff inaugurated the assembly on sunday by celebrating a 
solemn mass in st peters basilica for some 1000 priests bishops 
and cardinals from around the world 
the synod an advisory body that meets to discuss major issues 
in the roman catholic church was called by john paul to discuss 
the formation of priests 
let me express the hope that your labors here will produce the 
abundant fruit which the ecclesiastical community is expecting 
the pope clad in gold robes and miter said in his homily 
he noted that bishops from china vietnam and laos were missing 
from the gathering and said he hoped they would join the synod 
later 
no reason was given for the absence of bishops jean khamse of 
laos and cambodia paul nguyen van hoa and emmanuel le phong thuan 
of vietnam and lucas liu hsientang of china the vatican says the 
church faces serious restrictions in those communist countries 
at the last synod in 1987 dealing with the laity vietnamese 
prelates arrived midway through the assembly 
the synod is expected to focus on the difficulty in maintaining 
the churchs rules in a world characterized by eroticism as a 
working document put it the rules themselves are not expected to 
be subjects for debate however as the pope has shown no 
indication they might be changed 
several sexual scandals have embarrased the church in recent 
months 
the archbishop of atlanta eugene a marino resigned in july 
following revelations of a twoyear intimate relationship with 
a young woman in newfoundland canada a report in july by a 
churchappointed commission said priests had sexually abused boys 
in the province for more than a decade 
some priests question this requirement celibacy and some 
candidates leave formation for this reason the working document 
said 
it noted that in public opinion celibacy is often 
incomprehensible and ridiculed a priest who accepts celibacy 
is sometimes looked upon in a strange way it said 
in this situation a priest can become totally isolated and 
misunderstood to the point of becoming deeply demoralized it 
said in some cases the crisis in the priestly identity can 
explain why priests leave the ministry 
the vatican cited the phenomenon of burnout from which 
priests of all ages seem to suffer they live in situations marked 
by tiredness resignation lack of creativity 
the document lamented the shortage of priests and declining 
number of candidates in some countries 
the shortage of priests carries the further consequence that 
those older priests who are still active might become overburdened 
thus making them subject to stress and to approach their work 
simply as functionaries it said 
according to the latest statistics there are 400000 priests in 
the world down from 406000 five years ago in the united states 
students in the last four years of seminary numbered 3698 this 
year compared with 7855 in 1968 
the 200 bishops at the synod included cardinal joseph bernardin 
of chicago cardinal james hickey of washington dc archbishop 
daniel pilarczyk of cincinnati and bishop john marshall of 
burlington vermont

annoyance at the pilot of a world war ii 
navy plane intruding on a air show quickly turned to horror when 
the craft plunged into a lake killing at least seven people 
it was all over in just a split second a plume of water 
parts up in the air you heard the sound of the impact said stan 
sinn a san jose pilot who was among 350 spectators and competitors 
who watched the crash saturday 
then in less than a minute the lake looks like nothing ever 
happened it happened so quick if you had blinked your eye you 
would have missed it 
authorities believe seven people were on board no one survived 
said walt smith a federal aviation administration official based 
in nearby santa rosa 
six bodies have been recovered from the murky water and 
rescuers intended to search for a seventh victim today 
federal and county officials havent released the identities of 
those aboard the plane but the family of san rafael pilotplane 
owner doug lacey said they believe he was on board when it crashed 
officials have said that lacey 40 was at the controls of the 
aircraft when it stopped at sonoma county airport saturday morning 
to refuel 
but laceys family doubts the experienced pilot could have been 
at the controls when it crashed said rosemary wurst a cousin 
he was an excellent pilot somebody screwed up but they dont 
think doug was flying the airplane she said adding that one of 
the passengers migtt have been the pilot 
just before the crash the bulky aircraft made four low passes 
over the crowd and floating seaplanes meeting for the annual 
seaplane flyin at clear lake about 100 miles north of san 
francisco 
we could see it was a dangerous situation we were in the 
process of getting our aircraft out of the air when he made the 
last pass the fatal one sinn said 
the plane flew straight up to about 500 feet and stalled on its 
final pass sinn said an instant later the wing dipped and the 
plane turned upside down plunging nose first into the water and 
sending up a plume of water 60 to 70 feet high he said 
the plane landed in six feet of water about 50 yards offshore on 
the lakes west end the faa said 
officials said an initial investigation indicates a heavy load 
of fuel and passengers combined with high temperatures may have 
caused the plane to stall 
the plane had taken off from the sonoma county airport in santa 
rosa south of lake county investigators said 
the plane believed to date from 1945 was not part of the 
seaplane convention said walter windus vice president of the 
seaplane pilots association an event sponsor 
he was strictly an intruder said windus who witnessed the 
crash he saw an opportunity to show off and he took advantage of 
it he was doing air maneuvers that were not appropriate to that 
type of aircraft 
convention organizers tried desperately to contact the pilot of 
the mystery plane by radio planning to tell him to leave but 
could not reach him he said 
his behavior was so obnoxious windus said i was going to 
tell him to go away or i was going to report him to the faa

equipment and startup costs to begin operating the dams in 1991 
i made a choice to see these up and running and they will be 
i wont give up she said last week 
mrs hitchcock who decided in 1982 to establish a power 
company has worked out deals with utilities to buy power from her 
and has persuaded family members to raise the capital needed to get 
federal licenses on the dams 
after spending 180000 on consultants engineers 
environmentalists and other technical people to prepare her 
applications mrs hitchcock gained approval in march 1989 from the 
federal energy regulatory commission 
mrs hitchcock who lives in kohler a city of 1650 about 50 
miles north of milwaukee near the lake michigan shoreline said she 
has contacted about 40 lending institutions for financing and 
encountered absolute discrimination 
one bank told her no woman should get more than 50000 
said bob everett a lawyer for mrs hitchcock from ashland ky 
this lady has a iron stomach he said there are 
corporations who cannot handle this sort of hostile business 
climate 
her quest for loans rests on a 1978 federal law that requires 
utilities to purchase power from private operators the state has 
agreed to reduce interest on her debts from market rates to 3 
percent once loans are obtained 
mrs hitchcock who said she is in her early 50s began 
researching in 1982 the idea of buying dams abandoned in the 1950s 
and 1960s her husband is an engineer 
she reasoned the dams would provide a renewable and 
environmentally safe source of energy the profits perhaps 
100000 a year would ensure financial stability for herself 
husband and three adult children 
friends and relatives questioned whether it was worth it at one 
point her family told her to quit only a handful of people across 
the nation have started familyowned hydroelectric plants one 
recently failed in indiana 
in 1985 mrs hitchcock leased a dam on the eau galle river and 
a year later bought the rock river dam and its power plant in 
watertown for 3122 
mrs hitchcocks son carl 30 has leased two more dams for the 
family one on the sheboygan river and another on the red cedar 
river the dams have working generators but are awaiting federal 
licenses 
northern states power co signed a 20year contract to buy 
electricity from mrs hitchcock and a similar deal is about to be 
signed with wisconsin electric power co she said 
mrs hitchcock estimates the eau galle river project will 
furnish the yearly electrical needs of as many as 30 homes 
dan moran an analyst for the state division of energy said 
about 20 small hydroelectric plants owned by mostly local 
governments operate in wisconsin another 20 are idle but have 
working equipment that could provide a reasonable payback for 
private owners he said 
but john bartel a spokesman for wisconsin electric the states 
largest electric utility said mrs hitchcocks venture is risky 
and faces unpredictable weather and operating costs 
last year only 2 percent of the utilitys output came from the 
16 hydroelectric plants it operates he said 
shes got a tough row to hoe he said i hope she is 
successful

police have found evidence indicating 
the presence of a man other than the most prominent suspect at the 
scenes of two of the five college student slayings an unidentified 
source told one newspaper 
a second newspaper has cited an unnamed source that a man known 
to that suspect edward lewis humphrey is also a suspect in the 
five murders 
humphrey who has not been charged in the slayings has been 
jailed in brevard county for a month on 1 million bond in the 
beating of his grandmother 
laboratory analysis shows another man left important physical 
evidence at the scene of at least two of the five murders last 
month law enforcement officials told the st petersburg times 
investigators still consider humphrey a suspect in the slayings 
based on other evidence however and they are awaiting more lab 
test results those tests could take as long as six months to 
complete 
if officials know who left the physical evidence at the two 
crime scenes they arent saying but they do say its possible the 
killer may have worked in concert with a second person 
the mutilated bodies of sonja larson 18 and christina powell 
17 were found aug 26 the next morning christa hoyt 18 was 
found decapitated manuel taboada and tracy paules both 23 were 
found dead aug 28 
on sunday the tampa tribune quoted a lawenforcement source it 
did not identify as saying that a person known to be an associate 
of humphrey is a suspect and that his name became known to 
investigators soon after the killings 
the man was living in gainesville at the time of the murders but 
his whereabouts now are unclear the source said 
the lawyer representing humphrey said he finds it hard to 
believe the slayings could have been the work of more than one 
person 
im no expert on crime scenes and crime suspects but it 
doesnt seem likely to me to be a multiple participant case 
brevard county public defender jr russo said 
were not going to exclude the possibility that more than one 
person could be involved said gainesville police sgt dick 
gerard spokesman for the 150member task force investigating the 
slayings 
a day after the fourth and fifth victims were found in late 
august gainesville police chief wayland clifton said he believed 
the killings were the work of one person 
humphrey faces trial oct 8 on an aggravated battery charge in 
an attack on 79yearold elna hlavaty relatives identified 
humphrey 18 as her assailant on the night of the attack but mrs 
hlavaty has since denied she was beaten by humphrey

the foreign ministers of iran and saudi 
arabia met over the weekend iran said today in the first talks 
between senior officials from the countries since they broke 
diplomatic ties 2 years ago 
the official islamic republic news agency said that during the 
meeting sunday in new york the diplomats discussed restoring 
diplomatic relations and traded views on the persian gulf crisis 
the groundbreaking meeting apparently did not go much beyond 
both sides spelling out their positions but it was the most 
positive sign yet that the two countries may be moving toward a 
rapprochement amid the political upheaval triggered by iraqs aug 
2 invasion of kuwait 
a reconciliation would help draw iran into the antiiraq camp 
and intensify saddam husseins isolation 
saddam has been courting neighboring iran which was at war with 
iraq from 19801988 for help in puncturing the un economic 
embargo imposed after the invasion 
saudiiranian ties were severed in a dispute over the number of 
iranians allowed to attend the annual moslem pilgrimage to holy 
sites in saudi arabia there had been several violent incidents 
that the saudis said were incited by irans fundamentalist leaders 
the islamic republic news agency dispatch said the meeting 
between ali akbar velayati of iran and prince saud alfaisal of 
saudi arabia took place at un headquarters the official agency 
did not say how long it lasted 
the ministers were in new york for a global summit on children 
irna quoted velayati as telling prince saud that the main 
obstacle to resumption of relations was the dispute over the number 
of iranians allowed into saudi arabia to worship at islams holiest 
shrines at mecca and medina 
the iranian agency quoted prince saud as saying his government 
is eager to resolve this issue before the next pilgrimage in june 
the agency said prince saud promised that his government will do 
its best so that iranian moslems perform their rituals in a 
suitable matter 
in 1987 violent riots in mecca killed 402 people most victims 
were iranians defying saudi orders that ban political rallying 
during the pilgrimage season 
the following year the saudis announced a quota system that 
restricted the number of pilgrims allowed to participate in the 
annual event to 1000 per one million population for each country 
the iranias protested the move which would have cut the size 
of their contingent by more than two thirds from 150000 to 
45000 they called for stripping king fahd of saudi arabia of 
custodianship of the holy shrines 
in april 1988 the saudis severed relations with tehran 
accusing iran of subversion and terrorism 
the iranian complaints grew louder this year after 1426 people 
died in a stampede in a pedestrian tunnel in mecca tehran accused 
the saudis of failing to provide adequate protection for the 
pilgrims 
during its 198088 war with iraq iran accused the saudis of 
bankrolling baghdads war effort 
also during sundays meeting velayati explained irans position 
on the persian gulf crisis triggered by iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait irna said 
it said velayati told prince saud that iran is strongly 
opposed to the presence of foreign forces in the gulf and 
especially holy lands 
regional countries must cooperate for the security of the gulf 
and liberation of kuwait from iraqi occupation the news agency 
quoted velayati as saying 
saudi arabia invited the multinational force onto its territory 
fearing an iraqi invasion about 200000 us and other foreign 
troops have massed in the persian gulf mostly in saudi arabia to 
counter iraq 
baghdads government capitalizing on irans antiwestern 
sentiment moved quickly after the invasion of kuwait to formalize 
a peace deal with the iranians accepting all their terms for 
settling a border dispute 
although tehran says it is committed to the un embargo of 
iraq there have been increasing reports it is allowing food and 
other goods to move across the common border to iraq

indias supreme court today ordered the 
government to halt its job quota program the court said it hoped 
its temporary injunction would stop a wave of student protests and 
suicides 
the fivejudge panel also advanced the date for hearing 
arguments on the legality of the program by two weeks to oct 25 
press trust of india reported 
the court said the government could continue preparations for 
carrying out the plan which reserves 27 percent of federal jobs 
for lowcaste hindus 
the government is assembling a list of thousands of castes which 
will qualify for preference in job applications another 22 percent 
already are set aside for the lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy 
of indian society tribespeople and the socalled untouchables 
acting chief justice ranganath mishra said he hoped that peace 
would be restored while the issue was being studied by the nations 
highest court the temporary injunction will remain in effect until 
the supreme court rules on the legality of the quotas 
at least 70 people have died in demonstrations against the plan 
announced aug 7 by prime minister vp singh about 20 were 
uppercaste students who committed suicide by selfimmolation or 
poisoning after claiming they were victimized by the plan 
in parliament the government faced a separate problem when it 
failed to pass a constitutional amendment extending federal rule in 
the northern state of punjab where sikh militants are fighting for 
independence 
the state govenment in punjab was dismissed in 1987 and replaced 
by federal rule which the constitution limits to three years 
amending the document requires a twothirds majority 
in a surprise move aimed at embarassing the government the 
opposition congress party refused to support the bill leaders of 
all the parties were summoned to the speakers chambers to find a 
way out of the impasse 
singh 10monthold government suffered another setback when the 
speaker of the legislature agreed to hold a debate on a motion 
seeking to censure the government for mishandling the student 
protest 
the motion if passed would put pressure on the government to 
quit said kewal verma a parliamentary analyst 
there is no legal obligation on the part of the government to 
resign but it would amount to its defeat in moral terms said 
verma 
in the parliament congress party members accused singh of being 
obstinate for refusing to suspend or reconsider the affirmative 
action plan down down resign resign they shouted as singh 
stood up to speak he was prevented from addressing the house 
cant you see there is blood in your hands said congress 
lawmaker ajit panja some members advanced menacingly at singh but 
were stopped by colleagues you are a bloodstained politician 
said panja 
former congress minister vasant sathe said he was beginning a 
fast unto death until singh stops police terror on the 
students 
in the northern town of jammu 17yearold student sandeep 
sharma set himself on fire today in the latest suicide bid to 
protest the job quotas he suffered thirddegree burns over most of 
his body 
at least 20 students have died in the past 12 days from 
selfinflicted injuries most left notes blaming singhs job 
policy in addition 50 people have died by police gunfire in 
street battles 
singh announced the policy aug 7 to increase the quota for 
lowcaste indians in government jobs to 49 percent saying he was 
seeking social justice for indians discriminated against because of 
the social station of their birth 
uppercaste students say reverse discrimination will deprive 
them of government jobs for which they are better qualified 
singh also is facing a revolt in his own janata dal party over 
the issue 
former deputy prime minister devi lal resigned his parliamentary 
seat on sunday and dissidents called for a new party leader but 
the partys parliament bloc a key forum gave singh a vote of 
confidence 
allied parties whose tacit support keep the governing coalition 
in power also have attacked the governments handling of the 
demonstrations although none has criticized the idea of reserving 
jobs for deprived classes

president bush and key lawmakers avoided a 
crisis as the new fiscal year dawned today but they now must 
convince an electionyear congress to vote for 134 billion in new 
taxes and widespread cuts in federal programs 
its going to be very difficult for us house republican 
leader bob michel of illinois said today but white house chief of 
staff john sununu said president bush would lobby hard and i 
think in the long run it will be supported by a majority of 
republicans 
its a tough sale said rep tom tauke riowa one of many 
lawmakers who was troubled by what he was hearing of the package 
sunday 
democrats too were expected to swallow hard before agreeing to 
raising medicare premiums while cutting the benefits increasing 
taxes on gasoline alcohol and cigarettes and trimming everything 
from defense to student loans 
and despite a claimed 500 billion in deficit reduction it 
would stretch out the goal of a balanced budget and let the 
national debt increase another 1 trillion 
the 40 billion in deficit reduction for the fiscal year 
beginning today would still leave a record annual deficit of 254 
billion 
following president bushs announcement of the budget accord at 
the white house rose garden on sunday the house and senate easily 
approved and sent to bush legislation avoiding a government 
shutdown which was threatened for today 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the stopgap 
resolution which keeps the government going for five more days 
while more work is done on the budget would be signed by bush this 
afternoon 
because of the delays in enacting the fiscal 1991 budget the new 
fiscal year was starting without any of the normal spending bills 
required by law for government operations 
but while the stopgap bill was approved easily the votes in no 
way were endorsements for the budget agreement 
michel appearing on nbcs today show said he wouldnt be 
surprised if the budget pact failed to pass its first test votes 
later this week 
this is not going to be easy for everyone but it is 
necessary house speaker thomas s foley said on the same 
program 
sununu who appeared on abctv said the president would 
support it aggressively 
nitpickers may have a field day because the easy vote in 
this case is to find something you dont like and vote no senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan said sunday 
many on both sides seem ready to do just that 
i dont think its a compromise i think its totally caving in 
to the democratic liberals thats going to tax us right into a 
recession said rep dana rohrabacher rcalif 
it looks like a tax on people who are hurting the most 
excise taxes said rep charles rangel dny and you leave 
the richest of the rich alone 
the budget deal would raise taxes 134 billion over the next 
five years cut benefit programs 119 billion and for the 
remainder trim defense and domestic programs 
the most attractive part of the package politically may be that 
it is the only thing being offered to prevent the 33 percent 
acrosstheboard spending cuts of the grammrudman law those cuts 
if they took effect would cause everything from eliminating 
student loans to furloughing federal employees 
there are no pleasant choices here said rep ralph regula 
rohio the president as well as the democratic leadership is 
going to have to help sell it to the country 
bush promised to do just that i will do everything i can to 
generate support from the american people for this compromise he 
said 
hell also have to work hard on his notalwaysloyal 
congressional republicans one house gop leader rep newt gingrich 
of georgia refused to attend the rose garden ceremony sunday even 
though he was one of the negotiators 
aside from the grammrudman cuts the selling points amount 
mainly to vague promises about beneficial effects on the economy 
presumably the federal reserve would be able to reduce interest 
rates if the treasurys insatiable craving for credit were reduced 
but the downsides of the package are much more clear even as 
the agreement was being announced a group that lobbies for more 
benefits for the elderly was drumming up opposition 
it places a disproportionate amount of deficit reduction on 
the backs of older mericans said martha mcsteen president of 
the national committee to preserve social security and medicare 
about 60 billion of the deficit reduction would come from the 
medicare system roughly half by containing payments to health care 
providers and the rest from the elderly and all taxpayers 
the medicare payroll tax that now stops when a taxpayers income 
hits 51300 would keep going until a 73000 income cap state 
employees who currently dont pay the medicare tax or social 
security would be brought into the system 
meanwhile medicare patients would pay more of their doctor 
bills the annual deductible would double in two years from 75 to 
150 coverage for clinical testing would drop from full to 80 
percent and monthly premiums would rise from 2860 to about 34 
next year by 1995 they would rise to about 54 a month 
its asking the elderly to take a very hard hit said rep 
henry waxman dcalif the elderly didnt cause this problem i 
plan to vote against it 
strident opposition also was certain to raising the gasoline tax 
by 12 cents by next summer increasing the cigarette tax by 8 cents 
over the next two years and even a 25 annual fee on boaters 
sen alan cranston dcalif the deputy democratic leader said 
the best selling points for the plan may be the things that it does 
not contain a capital gains tax cut anathema to most democrats 
an income tax rate increase opposed by republicans or a cut in 
social security benefits considered poison by almost everyone in 
congress 
the president and congressional leadership have set a tight 
timetable with the first direct votes on the plan by friday and an 
oct 19 deadline for enacting the deal

president bush has put to rest his no new 
taxes pledge with a 134 billion flourish developing a plan with 
key congressional leaders that will prompt several weeks of 
tenacious debate but it wont solve the deficit crisis 
as the budget summit was ending in the white house rose garden 
on sunday bushs budget director was releasing a new deficit 
projection that showed that the agreements 40 billion in 1991 
savings already had been lost to economic reality 
richard darman blamed the nations poor economic performance and 
the spiraling costs of the savings and loan bailout for the 
worsening figures he said the fiscal year that begins today would 
end with a deficit of at least 254 billion even if congress goes 
along with the budget package 
a big if and without the package the deficit would soar to 
294 billion 
just because an impressive array of republican and democratic 
leaders shared the platform with bush in announcing the 500 
billion fiveyear agreement doesnt mean its a done deal 
far from it the agreement could have difficulty winning 
approval in both the house and senate although leaders can mount a 
strong case that it may be the last hope congress and the white 
house may ever have for reaching accord on cutting the deficit 
one key conservative rep newt gingrich rga the no 2 
republican leader in the house walked away from the pact and would 
not pose with bush in the rose garden with the others 
and with only three weeks remaining to enact the agreement a 
minority in the senate could keep the measure from passage through 
the threat of filibuster and other parliamentary maneuvering 
for all the ballyhooing by bush and congressional leaders about 
the boldness of the compromise plan the pact although 
ambitious in scope particularly in later years will not keep the 
fiscal 1991 deficit from being a record shortfall in excess of 250 
billion 
and it exacts a hard price on many americans 
of the total 500 billion deficit reduction package 1338 
billion is to come from new taxes and other revenue increases 
taxes on gasoline would more than double medicare premiums would 
rise farm subsidies would be cut and government services would 
decline 
welloff families earning over 100000 would find new limits on 
what they could deduct from their taxes and sharp new levies would 
be slapped on nonessential items like cigarettes booze and luxury 
boats 
bush said he would do my level best to take this case to the 
american people but he didnt elaborate white house officials 
said a primetime television address to the nation was a good 
possibility 
the president made the vow just days after he told republican 
audiences in the midwest he would take his case against 
congressional democrats to every state in the nation 
bush had scheduled a month of travels for october to speak on 
behalf of gop candidates presumably he will add a call for 
enactment of the bipartisan agreement to his stock speech 
the president has a history of compromising particularly on 
domestic issues so his willingness to stump the nation for an 
agreement that undoes two major tenets of his 1988 presidential 
campaign should not be a surprise 
still in going along with the pact bush formally put an end to 
his no new taxes campaign vow and he also abandoned at least 
for now a feature that until thursday he was insisting must be a 
part of any budget compromise a lower capital gains tax 
not only did bush not get a capital gains tax reduction in the 
package but the final measure also would have the effect of 
increasing taxes on the wealthy both through a 10 percent fee on 
luxuries and through new limits on tax deductions for higher income 
families 
white house aides pointed to a variety of other incentives in 
the plan designed to spur business investment and business growth 
but the fact remained that bush gave up plenty to get a budget 
agreement 
i dont think were going to get into the hot rhetoric of what 
gain or loss there is in political terms said bushs chief 
of staff john sununu there will be a lot of time for that to 
take place in the days and weeks ahead 
one final irony is that as negotiators were working hard to come 
up with even 40 billion in tax increases and spending cuts for the 
fiscal year that begins today about 10 billion smaller a package 
than originally planned budget officials were privately upping 
the estimate the deficit by an identical 40 billion 
before sunday budget officials warned that without a budget 
agreement the deficit for fiscal 1991 would be some 250 billion a 
record 
then darman on sunday said the deficit even with the agreement 
will be somewhere around 254 billion thats a far cry from the 
64 billion deficit figure called for under grammrudman 
faced with such a huge gap congress decided to change the 
grammrudman target and give itself and the white house another 
five years until 1998 to balance the budget

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether us businesses break the law if they discriminate against 
americans they employ outside the country 
the justices setting the stage for an important ruling said 
they will decide whether congress intended a major antibias law to 
reach beyond the nations borders 
a federal appeals court ruling in a case from saudi arabia 
said the law has no effect outside the country but federal trial 
judges have ruled in several other cases that the law does apply 
abroad 
the justices acted on appeals by the bush administration and a 
former oil industry employee 
ali boureslan of el paso texas is a naturalized citizen who 
was born in lebanon an engineer boureslan began working in 1979 
for aramco services co the houstonbased subsidiary of the 
arabian american oil co aramco 
he was transferred to saudi arabia in 1980 and alleges that 
once there he was subjected to racial and religious discrimination 
after filing a complaint with the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission boureslan sued aramco services and its 
parent company he charged them with violating an antibias law 
called title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 
the two companies contested the suit contending that title vii 
does not apply to alleged discrimination outside the united states 
a federal trial judge agreed and threw out the suit last 
february the entire 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the 
dismissal by a 95 vote 
in urging the justices to reverse the appeals court ruling eeoc 
and justice department lawyers said such a limiting interpretation 
of title viis reach would withdraw the acts protection from the 
many americans who spend a portion of their careers abroad 
the government appeal relied heavily on an exemption written 
into the law one that says the law shall not apply to an 
employer with respect to employment of aliens outside any state 
that exemption would be entirely superfluous if the act did 
not apply abroad in the first place the government appeal 
contended 
but the 5th circuit court said the exemption could be read to 
reflect a congressional intent to provide title vii coverage to 
aliens employed within but not outside the united states 
the cases are eeoc vs arabian american oil co 891838 and 
boureslan vs arabian american oil co 891845

cleared at a meeting wednesday between secretary of state james a 
baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
a us official briefing reporters said the bush 
administration would not go ahead with the summit unless the treaty 
is ready to be signed 
we do expect that things will shape up so that we will have an 
agreement at the time said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the 35 nations are all the european countries except albania 
plus the united states and canada east germany will drop out later 
in the week when it is merged into west germany to become one 
nation 
however the us official said the baltic states he referred 
to them as countries of lithuania latvia and estonia want to 
participate in the conference as observers or members 
we do hope they will be in a position to join he said 
that could mean a further separation of the baltics from the 
soviet union 
albania meanwhile is emerging from diplomatic isolation its 
participation in the conference would expand european membership 
among the issues facing the 35 foreign ministers here is where 
to base the small permanent secretariat that will be approved 
czechoslovakia has strong support in pitching for prague 
thats a real possibility the official said 
he stressed meanwhile that the bush administration does not 
want the european group to take on military functions 
the official said that role is reserved for nato and it will 
remain important so long as the soviets have a large army

the national legislature gave final approval today 
to a law on freedom of conscience aimed at ending decades of 
repression against religious believers 
the supreme soviet approved the law by a vote of 3412 with no 
abstentions 
the legislators approved the law in principle on wednesday but 
met again today to resolve a dispute between the two chambers over 
a clause permitting the use of school buildings for religious 
classes after regular hours 
the legislature voted 30346 with 16 abstentions to remove the 
clause after a confusing and tedious parliamentary dispute 
one of the chambers the council of the union had voted to 
remove the clause last week but the other the council of 
nationalities had no quorum for a vote 
patriarch alexi ii head of the russian orthodox church said he 
favored the clause as long as parental approval is required for 
students to attend afterschool religious classes 
if we remove this part of the law today we would be taking a 
step backward in our democratic development the patriarch said 
he also said church activities are now restricted to within the 
walls of churches because all schools were nationalized after the 
revolution 
historian roy medvedev a member of the supreme soviet also 
supported the clause arguing that in some small villages there is 
no place for students to gather for religious classes except public 
schools 
but other delegates argued that strict separation of church and 
state precludes the use of public schools for religious classes 
ukrainian legislator sergei ryabchenko argued that allowing 
schools to be used for religious classes could ignite religious 
tensions in some areas of the soviet union such as the western 
ukraine where there is conflict between ukrainian catholic and 
russian orthodox churches 
the legislatures agreement to drop the clause came after a 
meeting of a joint committee from the two chambers 
the lawmakers made other small changes voting to tax the 
profits of businesses run by religious organizations at the same 
rate as other businesses 
soviet religious leaders said thursday they are satisfied with 
the law but believe it should be shorter clearer and firmer 
after the revolution the communists seized some church property 
and assets and prohibited the teaching of religion they converted 
some churches into factories and established an officially atheist 
society 
the new law forbids the government from interfering in the 
practice of religion it also improves the legal status of 
religious organizations guarantees the right to study religious 
doctrine and calls for a religious council to advise the government 
on human rights 
western scholars estimate a quarter of the 285 million soviet 
people practice some faith and the number appears to be rising 
fast as official tolerance replaces hardline communist opposition 
to religion 
in recent years churches confiscated by the government have 
been reopened jews have been allowed to hold hebrew classes 
staterun television has broadcast holiday church services and 
government propaganda against religion has subsided

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating a libel lawsuit against janet malcolm a staff writer 
for the new yorker magazine by a psychologist who says she made up 
quotes attributed to him 
the justices said they will review a federal appeals court 
ruling that last year threw out jeffrey massons suit 
the appeals court ruling was criticized by some who said it 
recognized the right to fake quotes 
specifically the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled that 
public figures who sue for libel over allegedly altered quotes must 
show that the quotes are not even rational interpretations of 
what was said 
private citizens who sue for libel must prove only that the 
suedover statements are false and were made negligently but 
public figures who sue for libel must prove the statements are 
false and were made with actual malice knowledge or reckless 
disregard of falsity 
in dismissing massons suit the 9th circuit court said 
malice will not be inferred from evidence showing that the quoted 
language does not contain the exact words used provided that 
the fabricated quotations are either rational interpretations of 
ambiguous remarks made by the public figure or do not alter the 
substantive content of unambiguous remarks actually made by the 
public figure 
the appeals court did not rule on whether ms malcolm actually 
fabricated quotes attributed to masson a former projects director 
of the sigmund freud archives 
it instead said the fake quotes alleged by masson when compared 
to what he contends he said do not amount to actual malice 
the appeals court vote was 21 judge alex kozinski in a 
dissenting opinion said while the courts have a grave 
responsibility under the first amendment to safeguard freedom of 
the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my 
view a concomitant of a free press 
ms malcolms twopart article in the new yorker focused on 
massons struggle with other archives officials over sigmund 
freuds abandonment of a theory that certain mental illnesses 
originate in sexual abuse during childhood 
the article discussed massons claim that his contract with the 
archives was terminated because he made public his views that freud 
abandoned the theory simply to further his career and placate his 
colleagues 
the article subsequently was published in book form by alfred a 
knopf inc massons suit named the new yorker and knopf as 
defendants also 
the case is masson vs the new yorker 891799

workmen set up floodlights outside the 
reichstag today and camera crews from around the world filmed the 
carnivallike scene at the brandenburg gate in the final countdown 
to german unification 
it looked more like a hollywood set than the remnants of one of 
the most sinister sites of the cold war 
organ grinders played young women hastily planted new flowers 
and the sellers of soviet bloc military memorabilia could hardly 
keep with the demand from thousands of visitors 
at midnight tuesday as many as million people are expected to 
pack the squares in front of the reichstag and at the brandenburg 
gate 200 yards away chancellor helmut kohl will lead the official 
celebrations close to where the berlin wall once divided the city 
the masscirculation bild newspaper said that 10000 leftist 
radicals were expected to rampage in berlin on tuesday night and 
into wednesday to disrupt the unity fest west berlin police 
spokesman joerg gallas said he thinks the predicted number was 
exaggerated but said authorities were prepared for trouble 
from leftist and rightist extremists 
for 40 years there was dictatorship in east germany said 
60yearold ferdinand scheben of the west german city of cologne 
now im glad that were finally unifying in a peaceful way 
scheben promised to be at the tuesday night celebrations i 
plan to film the whole thing he said holding up his video 
camera 
germans from east and west joined by thousands of foreign 
tourists will start the nations party of the century tuesday 
afternoon 
the beer will flow and fireworks will light up the sky as the 
germans usher in unification with a wild street celebration that 
will be repeated in dozens of cities nationwide 
still there is trouble on the horizon as many predict clashes 
between leftist and rightist radicals 
im afraid thats something we will have to count on said 
west berlin policeman manfred seelig 
but for the jolly barrelchested seelig there was much more 
satisfaction in thinking about the historic merger 
certainly everyone thought it would come but no one not 
even the politicians thought it would come so quickly said the 
42yearold policeman 
around him there were dozens of cranes and booms hauling up 
film crews to get a better shot of the scene 
thousands of people strolled the area jamming the pariser platz 
on the eastern side 
under the communist regime east germans were hauled in to the 
police just for approaching the deserted square while those on the 
western side looked on to the site from special bleachers 
but for some the joy of unification was tempered by 
apprehension 
there are a lot of negative things that will happen said 
sylvia reichenbach from east berlin and unemployment is in first 
place among them 
the 26yearold nurse said she still has her job but her mother 
will lose hers next week and her father most likely will be out of 
work next year 
i dont plan to come here tomorrow night were worried about 
riots said ms reichenbach holding onto her 3yearold 
daughter julia as she tottered along one of the low walls in 
front of the reichstag 
the reichstag the historic site of the german parliament will 
on thursday play host to the first meeting of the joint parliament 
comprised of german lawmakers from east and west

the supreme court today refused to allow the 
display of a christmas nativity scene on the lawn of a county 
government building in charlottesville va 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that allowing a 
private group to display the nativity scene or creche on public 
property would violate the constitutionally required separation of 
church and state 
the albemarle county board of supervisors approved a request by 
the local chapter of the jaycees to display the creche and it was 
set up on the front lawn of the county office building from dec 6 
1987 until jan 10 1988 
a group that included unitarian ministers and a jewish rabbi 
sued the board in federal court over allowing the display 
the county officials said the lawn is a public forum where many 
public activities have been permitted including a beauty pageant 
a united way billboard weddings and a civil rights demonstration 
the officials said the freespeech rights of the jaycees would 
be violated if the group were barred from displaying the creche 
the officials also noted that the creche was accompanied by a sign 
that said it was sponsored by the jaycees not the county 
a federal judge declared the display unconstitutional and the 
4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the ruling last february 
the unmistakable message conveyed is one of government 
endorsement of religion the appeals court said 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1989 supreme court ruling 
that said a nativity scene standing alone inside a government 
building in pittsburgh was unconstitutional 
the justices that same day allowed a jewish hanukkah menorah to 
be displayed outside a pittsburgh government building a block away 
because it was accompanied by some secular or nonreligious 
items 
the rulings last year were the high courts latest 
pronouncements on what has become a familiar issue for the 
justices 
but the pittsburgh decisions left unclear whether either 
building there was a public forum where individuals or groups 
traditionally exercise freedom of expression 
the court split 44 in 1985 in forcing the affluent new york 
city suburb of scarsdale to permit a private groups nativity scene 
in a village park where nonreligious displays were allowed 
the albemarle county officials said the lawn in front of the 
county building is a recognized public forum just as that scarsdale 
park was 
the charlottesville case was clouded by the absence of the 
jaycees as a party to the dispute in effect the county officials 
defended the freespeech rights of the jaycees 
the case is county of albemarle vs smith 892010

argentine president carlos menem said today that 
iraqs saddam hussein has to be stopped but declined to say 
whether he was prepared to send argentine forces into battle to 
force iraq out of kuwait 
president bush conferred separately this morning with menem and 
uruguay president luis alberto lacalle thanking both latin leaders 
for their solidarity in the international stand against iraq for 
invading kuwait 
menem also assured bush that he has completely deactivated a 
secret condor missile development program that past argentine 
military governments had pursued 
the united states has feared that the program could make it 
easier for hostile regimes in libya and elsewhere to get their 
hands on such mediumrange missiles 
menem questioned about whether he was prepared to commit his 
forces to fight against iraq said we have sent this group of 
professional officers to consolidate and give support to the 
embargo that was decided upon by the un 
but i cannot give you an opinion on something that has not 
yet happened he said 
did bush give menem the impression that war was likely 
no no no said menem adding that they did not discuss 
the possibility of war but he said we have agreed that 
iraqs president has to be stopped 
menem recently dispatched two warships to the persian gulf 
becoming the first and so far only latin leader to commit forces to 
the international armada 
bush called menem courageous and said the united states 
is very grateful to you not just for his stand in the gulf 
crisis but his economic reforms as well 
lacalle told bush that uruguay has been really hurt by 
honoring the sanctions 
we had 30 million of meat mutton ready to be sent to iraq 
under recently negotiated contracts he said its two punches 
the oil and the cutting of those contracts 
uruguay is asking the united nations for some of the 
international aid that will be distributed to third countries that 
bear the brunt of the effort to isolate iraq 
uruguay is a country that has paid a serious price for 
complying with the sanctions assistant secretary of state 
bernard aronson said afterwards we would hope that their claim 
would be looked on sympathetically and seriously 
on the condor missiles aronson said menem told bush it had been 
completely deactivated 
we certainly take menem at his word said the state 
department official thats a major step in reducing the threat 
of missile proliferation 
menem also said he is cooperating with brazil on efforts to 
assure safeguards in the latin countries nuclear programs 
bush and the latin leaders also discussed efforts to forge a 
common market of brazil argentina uruguay and paraguay and their 
desire to see the general agreement on tariffs and trade produce a 
breakthrough on lowering trade barriers around the world 
bush told menem the united states shares argentinas concerns 
about the agricultural subsidies that the european community 
provides its farmers aronson said

history is opening up windows to the past by offering the public a 
way to trace the roots of former slaves 
the department is establishing a computer index of the first 
labor contracts that onetime slaves in mississippi entered into as 
free people in 1865 and 1866 
we plan to make the information available to the public in 
february said ht holmes director of the departments library 
division the computer searches would be free 
librarians would guide families through thousands of labor 
contracts kept by the freedmens bureau formed by congress after 
the civil war to ensure former slaves were treated fairly holmes 
said 
the contracts detailed the former slaves names where they were 
working their bosses terms of their pay and in some instances 
their general health 
the washingtonbased documents are extensively used said judy 
thorne a consultant at the national archives 
a lot of people who are doing southern history are interested 
in them a lot of people interested in afroamerican history use 
them and a few military historians are interested in them because 
the military was running the project thorne said 
the freedmens bureau supervised abandoned or confiscated land 
issued rations of clothing and medicine established hospitals 
monitored working conditions recorded new and old marriages and 
set up schools 
mississippi had 436631 slaves in 1860 out of a total population

the supreme court said today it will try to 
clarify what authority police have to pursue and detain people who 
run away after seeing police 
the justices agreed to consider reinstating the cocaine 
conviction and 68month sentence of an oakland calif youth who a 
state court said was chased and caught unlawfully by police 
california attorney general john van de kamp argues that the 
state court ruling limits too severely police authority in such 
situations 
two members of the oakland police departments drug task force 
were on patrol april 18 1988 when they saw four young men 
standing by a parked car the youths saw the officers when the 
patrol car was about 40 yards from them they immediately ran away 
and the parked car sped off 
the officers who said they suspected they had interrupted a 
drug transaction decided to give chase officer jerry pertoso took 
a course that resulted in his running straight into a youth 
identified as hodari d 
initially looking over his shoulder the youth did not see the 
officer until they were about 10 feet apart pertoso testified that 
the youth then threw away what turned out to be a rock of cocaine 
pertoso stopped hodari d forced him to the ground and 
handcuffed him the officer then retrieved the cocaine 
hodari d was found to have possessed cocaine by a juvenile 
court judge who ordered him placed in an appropriate county 
facility for five years and eight months 
a state appeals court however overturned the youths 
conviction 
the appeals court ruled that the police chase undertaken 
without a reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed 
amounted to an unlawful detention 
the appeals court also ruled that hodari ds abandonment of the 
cocaine rock was a direct result of the unlawful detention so the 
drug should not have been used as evidence against him 
the constitutions fourth amendment generally requires police to 
obtain a court warrant before conducting searches or making 
arrests courts have allowed some warrantless searches and arrests 
but only when police do not have time to get a warrant and have 
probable cause or a reasonable suspicion to suspect a crime 
the california supreme court refused to hear the states appeal 
last march 15 
in the appeal acted on today van de kamp argued that a police 
chase never can be a detention 
when a citizen exercises his constitutional right to leave the 
vicinity of a police officer the former is not detained until the 
latter has forcibly restrained him the attorney general said 
in deciding a michigan case in 1988 the nations highest court 
said officers sometimes may chase someone who starts running at the 
sight of them even if they have no reason to suspect criminal 
conduct 
but the court left undecided whether police pursuit ever could 
amount to a seizure 
the case is california vs hodari d 891632

university of the district of columbia 
officials said today that the embattled school is now open but 
some 400 protesters urged students to continue a boycott that 
halted classes for three days last week 
at this time compromise is not in our vocabulary said mark 
thompson a leader of the protest it is ludicrous for the board 
not to do what we are asking them to do 
students barricaded themselves in a university building last 
wednesday and refused to leave unless 11 mayoral appointees to the 
board of trustees agreed to immediately resign 
interim university president miles fisher said staff and 
administrators were reporting to school today at their regular 
times a meeting between students and administrators was scheduled 
today along with two student rallies 
hundreds of students gathered outside campus buildings today 
still calling for the resignations of the board members appointed 
by mayor marion barry the resignations would take effect march 31 
protesters claim board members have lost touch with students and 
allowed the quality of the 12000student universitys academic 
programs to decline 
students also are upset at plans to renovate a building to 
display the controversial feminist artwork the dinner party 
the renovations a condition of acquiring the work would cost the 
financiallystrapped school 16 million 
trustee roger wilkins a veteran civil rights activist said 
school officials had agreed to reconsider that decision and had 
come to terms with students on about 40 demands 
the negotiation sessions have been civil and very 
professional he said sunday they have been marked in my 
judgment by a mutual desire a very strong desire on each side to 
improve this university and to heal it 
wilkins said two board members resigned voluntarily for personal 
reasons though others on the 15member panel refused to do so 
the trustees nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the city 
council cannot be forced to resign without cause 
the schools faculty senate and several city officials have 
voiced support of the students 
city council members have attempted to get past stalemated 
negotiations by offering to consider expanding the board to 21 
members trustees have offered to support the idea 
wilkins said demands to which the board has agreed include 
assuming control of the schools cafeteria providing daycare 
facilities and establishing a formal grievance procedure to resolve 
student complaints

the supreme court today agreed to hear an 
appeal by a former west virginia legislator convicted of extorting 
money from a group of foreigntrained doctors and not reporting it 
as taxable income 
the court said it will consider overturning a 50000 fine and 
threeyear suspended prison sentence and probation for robert l 
mccormick a former member of the west virginia house of delegates 
mccormick who represented an economically depressed coalmining 
region suffering from a shortage of doctors was a longtime 
supporter of legislation allowing foreigntrained physicians to 
practice in underserved areas of the state without meeting full 
licensing requirements 
federal prosecutors said that in 1984 mccormick told john 
vandergrift a lobbyist for the doctors that his reelection 
campaign was expensive and that he had not heard from the 
physicians 
vandergrift then delivered an envelope to mccormick containing 
nine 100 bills from dr ernesto manual head of the group called 
the coalfield health care association prosecutors said mccormick 
received additional cash payments bringing the total to 4300 
mccormick sponsored legislation in 1985 to give permanent 
medical licenses to experienced foreigntrained doctors who failed 
to get passing grades on licensing exams the doctors had been 
practicing with temporary permits 
mccormick was convicted of extorting 900 from the doctors and 
not reporting it as taxable income the jury deadlocked on counts 
of the indictment charging him with taking additional payoffs 
the former lawmaker said the money was a campaign contribution 
and said he did not report it to the internal revenue service 
because the cash reimbursed him for expenses 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in upholding the 
conviction in february ruled there was substantial evidence for 
the jury to conclude mccormick was guilty of extortion 
the appeals court said it is not necessary to show there is a 
quid pro quo exchange of money for government favors to prove a 
violation of the federal hobbs act outlawing extortion 
such a quid pro quo may be present in an extortion but as 
long as the use of official power is the basis for the extortion 
then it is not an essential element of the crime the appeals 
court said 
the appeals court also noted that west virginia law forbids cash 
campaign contribution of more than 50 
mccormicks acceptance of money in violation of state law is 
additional evidence of extortion the appeals court said 
it also rejected mccormicks argument that the money was not 
taxable personal income but reimbursement for campaign expenses 
the jury had ample evidence to conclude the 900 was not a 
legitimate campaign contribution and therefore to decide it was 
taxable the appeals court said 
the case is mccormick vs us 891918

the supreme court today rejected a challenge 
to the federal law barring some state and local government 
employees from being political candidates 
the court without comment let stand connecticuts loss of 
about 150000 in federal welfare money because two welfare workers 
ran for office 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for connecticut argued 
that the federal law known as the hatch act violates the 
constitutionally protected right of political association and 
tramples state sovereignty 
a federal trial judge and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
rejected those arguments previously 
the hatch act limits not only the political activities of 
federal employees but also those of state and local government 
workers employed by agencies that receive federal loans or grants 
the act bars federal employees from taking an active part in 
political management or in political campaigns it originally 
imposed such a ban for some state and local government workers but 
was narrowed so that now only political candidacy is barred for 
them 
in 1985 wayne camillieri worked for the connecticut department 
of human resources in a position involved with federally funded 
programs camillieri since 1983 had been a member of the hartford 
city council 
the us merit systems protection board in mid1985 informed 
camillieri that the hatch act prohibited him from seeking 
reelection to the city council if he remained in his state 
government job 
camillieri nevertheless ran for reelection he was defeated in 
the democratic primary 
the board subsequently ordered the state agency to remove 
camillieri from his position warning that failure to do so within 
30 days would result in the withholding of federal loans and grants 
equal to two years pay for camillieri 
the state agency refused to remove him and 90150 in federal 
funds were withheld 
jack winkleman also was an employee of the connecticut 
department of human resources involved in federally funded programs 
when in 1986 he was endorsed by the republican party as a candidate 
for probate judge 
winkleman ran for the office while holding his state agency job 
but he was defeated in the general election 
the federal board later ordered that winkleman be removed from 
his job threatening to withhold federal money equal to two years 
of his pay if he were not within 30 days 
the agency balked and 60896 in federal money was withheld 
state officials sought review in federal court but the 
withholding of funds was upheld by us district judge jose 
cabranes 
citing past supreme court rulings cabranes said 
infringements upon the ability of government employees be they 
federal or state to be candidates for elective office do not 
violate the first amendment 
he also rejected arguments that the federal governments action 
against the state violated the 10th amendments granting of state 
sovereignty 
the appeals court upheld cabranes ruling in a brief order last 
january 
state officials then sought help from the nations highest 
court 
the case is connecticut vs us merit systems protection board

a former san jose city council member who won 
and then lost a 101 million libel award against his local 
newspaper lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand rulings that claude 
fletcher failed to prove the san jose mercury news in california 
published statements about him with actual malice knowledge 
or reckless disregard of their falsity 
fletcher sued the mercury news over a series of 1984 articles 
reporting on his conduct while a city council member and as a board 
member of a local antipoverty agency 
fletchers 1984 bid for reelection failed after the articles 
were published the articles reported that five agency officials 
said fletcher tried to steer a 16 million contract to an 
insulation business in which he became a partner 
the articles quoted the agencys executive director as saying 
that fletcher once offered him and his wife a trip to hawaii which 
the agency official interpreted as a bribe 
a jury in 1986 awarded fletcher 250000 in general damages 
25000 in special damages and 735000 in punitive damages 
but the trial judge threw out the award ruling that fletcher 
had failed to prove the articles were published with actual malice 
a burden facing any public official who sues for libel 
private citizens who sue for libel need only prove that an 
allegedly libelous statement was false and made negligently 
a state appeals court upheld the dismissal of the award and the 
california supreme court refused to hear fletchers appeal last 
february 
in its 1989 ruling the appeals court said the evidence 
suggests a sincere attempt to report what the mercury news viewed 
as unethical behavior on the part of a san jose public official 
it added clearly the articles contained factual errors but 
was there clear and convincing evidence that the papers reporter 
did not believe his story was true we do not think so 
in the appeal acted on today fletcher said the articles about 
him represented highly unreasonable conduct constituting an 
extreme departure from ordinary standards of investigation and 
reporting 
he said there was sufficient evidence of actual malice 
the case is fletcher vs san jose mercury news 891788

worried that the mayors mind is 
elsewhere a nashville car dealer has offered the citys chief 
executive 75000 to quit 
but mayor bill boners answer will have to wait until he returns 
from hawaii where he reportedly has gone to marry an aspiring 
country singer today 
it is obvious to all of nashville that bill boner is 
distracted from his job businessman lee beaman said friday 
our city is suffering from the void in leadership for the good 
of the city bill boner should resign so we can elect a mayor in a 
special election and move our city forward 
in order to make it easier for mayor boner to resign i have 
offered to pay the 75000 in salary he would be giving up if he 
resigns now 
boner 45 turned heads in nashville when he announced his 
engagement ot traci peel 34 at the time he was still married to 
his third wife 
boners exploits were chronicled far and wide after the 
nashville banner published an interview with peel in which she said 
the mayors passion could last seven hours 
bumper stickers quickly appeared in nashville that said seven 
hours for traci three years for nashville 
beaman head of beaman automotive group and an officer with the 
beaman bottling co said he made the offer a month ago to two

the supreme court today turned down the appeal 
of a pennsylvania man given the longest prison sentence and biggest 
fine in us history for any person convicted of an environmental 
crime 
the court without comment let stand the threeyear prison term 
and 200000 fine john pozsgai of morrisville pa received for 
violating the clean water act 
pozsgais lawyers told the justices his punishment was unfairly 
severe for what was essentially a regulatory offense 
there was no evidence that any wildlife or fishery habitat was 
harmed or that water quality was impaired pozsgais appeal 
said 
yet his punishment included the appeal said the longest 
unsuspended jail term imposed in the history of the united states 
for any environmental crime including the dumping of extremely 
toxic and hazardous wastes and where people were even injured and 
killed 
pozsgai 57 operates a truckrepair business from a garage 
behind his house in the small town near trenton nj across the 
street from his house is a 14acre lot that for years had been used 
as a dumping site mainly for thousands of old tires 
a small stream ran through the lot leaving at a point not far 
from the pennsylvania canal 
while pozsgai in 1986 was negotiating to buy the lot 
engineering and environmental consultants told him the lot was 
considered protected wetlands any development would have to be 
approved by the us army corps of engineers pozsgai was told 
he began filling a portion of the property even before 
finalizing the purchase in june 1987 
in april of that year a corps of engineers inspector warned 
pozsgai that federal law barred him from continuing to deposit fill 
on the land without first obtaining permits 
according to court records truckloads of fill continued to be 
dumped on the land 
in september 1987 pozsgai was informed that the filling was a 
violation of the clean water act and was ordered to stop all such 
activity the filling continued 
the federal government sued pozsgai in the summer of 1988 and 
obtained a court order directing him to immediately stop depositing 
fill on the land 
in a jury trial pozsgai was convicted on 40 counts of violating 
the clean water act asked by federal prosecutors to send a 
message to all property owners us district judge marvin katz 
sentenced pozsgai to three years in prison five years of probation 
and one year of supervised release he also fined him 200000 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals upheld the conviction and 
sentence last january 
in the appeal acted on today pozsgais lawyers argued that his 
dueprocess rights had been violated at trial and that his 
punishment was too stiff 
since the justice department has announced its intention to 
use this case and others like it to bring a reign of terror upon 
environmental violators however minor the offense this court 
should ensure that the rules they play by are lawful ones the 
appeal said 
the case is pozsgai vs us 891735

frank snepp the excia operative turned 
author lost a supreme court appeal today in his fight with the spy 
agency over getting prepublication clearance for some of his work 
the court without comment left intact rulings that put the 
burden on snepp not the cia to seek a courts help if 
disagreements arise over what the agency is entitled to censor 
snepp worked for the central intelligence agency from 1968 to 
1976 working either in vietnam or on vietnam matters at cia 
headquarters in langley va 
in 1977 snepp published a critical account of the final days of 
us involvement in vietnam the book decent interval was 
published without first having been submitted for agency 
preclearance 
the supreme court in 1980 ruled that snepps publication of the 
book was a breach of his employment contract with the cia and 
ordered that he forfeit all proceeds from the book to the agency 
the high court also ruled that the cia could continue to require 
snepp to submit any agencyrelated writings for prepublication 
approval 
a footnote to the 1980 decision said allowing such preclearance 
was not condoning censorship if snepp in compliance with 
contract had submitted his manuscript for review and the agency 
had found it to contain sensitive material presumably an 
effort would have been made to eliminate harmful disclosures the 
court said 
absent agreement in this respect the agency would have borne 
the burden of seeking an injunction against publication the 
footnote said 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for snepp said that 1980 
footnote overturned what had been the cias policy of forcing 
employees and exemployees to go to court to challenge an agency 
decision not to allow publication of certain material 
prior to the 1980 supreme court ruling in snepps case the 4th 
us circuit court of appeals had ruled that cia employees and 
exemployees should have the responsibility for initiating court 
fights when disputes arise over the agencys preclearance 
procedures 
the current dispute between snepp and the cia stems from his 
submission for preclearance review in 1985 of a potential 
television miniseries called background lawcase story 
after several rounds of negotiations the cia sought just one 
deletion but by that time the television deal had fallen through 
the 4th circuit court last february rejected snepps contention 
that the agency had been obligated to seek a courts help in its 
effort to keep snepp from publishing the submitted manuscript 
the appeals court said the 1980 supreme court footnote did not 
reverse its previous ruling absolving the cia of the responsibility 
of seeking judicial review

the supreme court today permitted the random 
drug testing of new york citys 10000 jail guards 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by the guards 
labor union which said the tests violate the officers privacy 
rights 
the new york court of appeals the states highest court upheld 
the city department of corrections drugtesting program by a 43 
vote in may 
the city uses a computer to select 50 guards at random every two 
weeks for urine tests 
the state court said the city has a compelling interest in 
requiring the tests and said the guards who undergo other 
inspections not required of ordinary citizens or other government 
workers have a diminished expectation of privacy 
by choosing to work in the paramilitary milieu of the city 
corrections department guards voluntarily sacrifice certain 
cherished freedoms judge joseph bellacosa wrote for the state 
court he noted that the guards already undergo drug tests apart 
from the random program they challenged when they apply for jobs 
and while they are on probation 
the city also has a big stake in assuring the guards are drug 
free he said 
the prevention detection and resolution of the myriad daily 
crises in this nether world demand the acutest sensory awareness 
undulled by the use of illicit drugs bellacosa said 
chief judge sol wachtler in a strongly worded dissent said the 
state court ruling made an important constitutional right the 
latest casualty in the war on drugs 
union officials for the guards said tests should be required 
only of those the city has reason to believe are using drugs the 
union said the guards do not have direct responsibility for 
protecting the safety of the general public and because they work 
in confined quarters are less likely to be exposed to drugs 
the union noting the citys claim that 12 percent of tenured 
guards and 29 percent of probationary officers use drugs said 
random testing is unwarranted when such a minute proportion of 
the staff may be using drugs 
the supreme court in 1989 upheld mandatory blood and urine tests 
for railroad workers involved in accidents and for us customs 
service employees seeking drugenforcement jobs 
the high court has not ruled specifically on random tests for 
government workers but it repeatedly has denied without comment 
appeals by such employees challenging random tests 
police officers in new york city also must undergo random drug 
tests they did not challenge the tests in court 
new york state officials have not instituted such tests for 
prison guards who have completed probation 
the case is seelig vs koehler 9048

a group of atheists challenging an oath for 
potential trial jurors that includes the phrase so help me god 
lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand rulings in a texas case 
that excluding atheists from jury service for refusing to take such 
an oath does not violate their rights 
the court also rejected the atheist groups challenge of texas 
courts policy of asking potential jurors about their religion 
use of the juror oath and questionnaire challenged by famed 
atheist madalyn ohair and her austinbased society of 
separationists was upheld by a federal judge and the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals 
in its ruling last february the appeals court said the 
occasion to serve on a jury in undeniably a duty a privilege and 
an opportunity for many citizens to actively and personally serve 
their government even so jury service has not been construed 
as a constitutionally protected right 
the appeals court also said that the so help me god phrase 
in the jurors oath for travis county texas trials is merely a 
solemn declaration of truthfulness not an oath to a deity 
about potential jurors being asked on information cards to state 
their religious affiliation including atheism the appeals court 
said atheism is indeed a relevant factor for the parties and 
attorneys involved in the jury selection process as much so as 
whether a potential juror is a baptist a presbyterian or a 
buddhist

the supreme court today left intact a policy 
that lets federally regulated banks sell insurance 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by insurance 
industry lawyers who said the federal reserve board policy could 
lead banks into the same morass that has befallen the savings and 
loan industry 
the cost to american taxpayers of bailing out the thrift 
institutions recently was estimated at 500 billion the insurance 
officials reminded the court 
the independent insurance agents of america and other groups 
challenged a 1989 federal reserve board order permitting two 
indiana banks acquired by a bank holding company to sell insurance 
the fed said the bank holding company act of 1956 does not bar 
bank holding companies from acquiring bank subsidiaries engaged in 
nonbanking activities 
the board acted after a congressional moratorium had been lifted 
on nonbanking activities by banks 
merchants national corp a bank holding company was granted 
permission by the fed to acquire the anderson banking co and the 
mid state bank of hendricks county in indiana 
anderson bank has sold insurance since the bank opened for 
business in 1916 mid state purchased an insurance agency in 1985 
the ability of bank holding companies to enter risky 
businesses directly threatens to compromise the financial stability 
of bank holding companies insurance industry officials said in 
their high court appeal 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled in november that the 
fed did not exceed its authority in the merchants national case

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
the murder conviction of clarence lee brandley a former high 
school janitor set free this year after more than nine years on 
death row in texas 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that brandley 
who is black was denied a fair trial in the rapemurder of a 
16yearold white girl 
the justices rejection of an appeal by texas officials appears 
to put an end to the muchpublicized case prosecutors said 
previously they would not retry brandley if the high court rejected 
their appeal 
the case generated widespread attention with charges that 
racially biased police officers concealed evidence failed to 
pursue leads and mistreated key witnesses 
brandley 39 of houston once came within five days of being 
executed he now is studying to become an electrician 
he was freed in january after the texas court of criminal 
appeals threw out his conviction for the aug 23 1980 murder of 
cheryl dee fergeson she was strangled after attending a volleyball 
tournament at the houstonarea high school where brandley worked as 
a janitor 
brandleys first trial ended in a hung jury an allwhite jury 
convicted him of capital murder in his second trial 
brandleys lawyers said he was the victim of racism and texas 
courts lent support to charges he was accused falsely 
a judge in 1987 recommended a third trial citing discrimination 
against brandley 
the texas court of criminal appeals said last december that 
brandley was the victim of blatant unfairness 
the violent end to cheryl fergesons young life is both 
senseless and tragic the state court said our outrage over 
her murder however cannot justify the subversion of justice that 
took place during the investigation 
the state court noted that prosecutors relied heavily on 
contradictory testimony by three other janitors all of them white 
moreover the state court said texas ranger wesley styles who 
headed the investigation failed to question the other janitors 
separately when he conducted a walk through of the events of 
the day of the murder 
the state court noted that one of the janitors who testified 
against brandley later admitted he had lied saying he was afraid 
of styles and one of the other janitors 
the state court cited evidence the murder investigation was so 
contrived that it created false testimony and failed to follow 
any leads which did not comport with the preconceived premature 
notion that brandley committed the murder 
district attorney peter speers of montgomery county texas took 
the appeal to the supreme court state attorney general jim mattox 
refused to go along saying brandleys conviction was racially 
tainted 
the case is texas vs brandley 891887

the supreme court today killed a 9yearold 
libel lawsuit stemming from two letters written to thenpresident 
reagan opposing a north carolina mans appointment as a federal 
prosecutor 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that dismssed the 1981 suit filed by david smith of 
greensboro nc against robert mcdonald the operator of 
childcare centers in virginia 
smith was seeking nomination and appointment as a us attorney 
in north carolina when mcdonald wrote the letters opposing smith 
copies of both letters one mailed in late 1980 and one in early 
1981 were sent to various members of congress and edwin meese who 
guided reagans transition team 
according to court documents the letters accused smith of 
violating the civil rights of various individuals while a state 
judge and charged him with extortion or blackmail and 
violations of professional ethics 
smiths suit against mcdonald went all the way to the nations 
highest court before it ever reached a trial 
in 1985 the supreme court justices used the case to rule that 
people may be sued over allegedly libelous statements made in 
letters and petitions to government officials the decision said 
the first amendment right to petition the government did not cloak 
mcdonald in absolute immunity from being sued over what he said 
about smith 
the case then went to a federal jury which awarded smith 
200000 in damages 
but the 4th us circuit court of appeals in february threw out 
that award after ruling that mcdonald was entitled to absolute 
immunity under north carolina common law 
in the appeal acted on today smith argued that the states 
common law provides only qualified not absolute immunity from 
lawsuits in such circumstances

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
that usx corp illegally discriminated against blacks at a fairless 
hills pa steel mill 
the justices without comment rejected arguments that a federal 
appeals court flagrantly disregarded a 1989 supreme court 
decision in ruling against the giant manufacturer 
the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled 
that usx formerly known as us steel corp discriminated against 
blacks who applied for nonskilled production and maintenance jobs 
at the steel mill 
the justices then ordered the appeals court to restudy that 
ruling in light of their 1989 decision called wards cove packing 
co vs antonio 
in it the high court made it far more difficult for workers to 
win some jobbias lawsuits 
the courts wards cove ruling was one of several 1989 decisions 
congress is seeking to overcome in a major civil rights bill 
passed in slightly differing versions by both the house and 
senate 
president bush saying he believes the legislation would force 
employers to adopt racial quotas has threatened to veto the bill 
unless considerable changes are made before it reaches his desk 
after reexamining the fairless hills case the 3rd circuit 
court again ruled against usx 
although wards cove may have reduced the employers burden of 
showing a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged 
practices we perceive no reason to disturb the district courts 
and our own prior rejection of usxs assertion that its 
practices were not discriminatory the appeals court said 
although wards cove may have relaxed the employers burden to 
rebut the plaintiffs case we do not read the decision as 
requiring us to accept at face value an employers explanations of 
adverse impact of its hiring practices on blacks the appeals 
court added 
a federal judge in 1983 ordered usx to end all discrimination in 
the hiring of production and maintenance employees at the fairless 
hills mill and awarded more than 123 million to those 
represented by a class action lawsuit 
the judge ruled that statistics showing the disparity between 
the percentages of black applicants and black hires proved that usx 
violated a federal antibias law known as title vii of the civil 
rights act of 1964 
the appeals court upheld the judges title vii ruling but 
ordered him to reconsider the monetary award in a way usx lawyers 
said could raise the award to about 30 million 
the fairless hills mill where 7000 to 10000 workers are 
employed at a given time hired 5516 people including 977 blacks 
to production and maintenance jobs in the years 197182 
in those years blacks represented 259 percent of the 
applicants and 176 percent of the hires 
in the appeal acted on today usx lawyers argued that the 3rd 
circuit court flagrantly disregarded the justices mandate by 
giving wards cove only lip service 
the 3rd circuit imposed on usx the burden of proving that 
innocent factors not race caused the bottom line disparities 
rather than merely producing a reasonable business justification 
for the specific employment practice at issue the steel 
companys appeal said 
the case is usx vs green 891816

iraqi president saddam hussein today 
ordered the release of nine french nationals the official iraqi 
news agency reported 
the frenchmen were among hundreds of westerners believed held at 
key military and other installations saddam fears might be attacked 
by the west 
it was the second gesture by iraq toward france in as many days 
on sunday saddam complimented french president francois mitterrand 
for offering positive ideas to resolve the persian gulf crisis 
the iraqi agency monitored in nicosia said president saddam 
hussein has issued orders to allow some french guests to leave iraq 
in the company of mr gilles munier the president of the 
association of francoiraqi friendship 
ina the report added has learned that nine frenchmen are 
included in this humanitarian gesture 
foreigners mainly westerners were banned from traveling after 
the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait and the subsequent annexation 
of the oilrich emirate 
as of late last month 4200 westerners remained in iraq and 
kuwait including an undetermined number being held at iraqi 
military installations 
in sundays message saddam softened his confrontational stand 
in the gulf crisis calling for replacing the language of threats 
and warnings with a dialogue however he again linked any 
solution to an israeli pullout from the occupied territories 
the united states has rejected that proposal insisting on an 
unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
but mitterrand in a speech before the un general assembly 
last week stressed the need to resolve other issues although he 
demanded an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
he also suggested a simultaneous withdrawal of the iraqis from 
kuwait and the usled multinational force from saudi arabia 
in his message to arabs and moslems released by the official 
media on sunday saddam said he intended to initiate contact with 
paris he said mitterrands initiative could be developed to 
serve as a foundation for a settlement in the gulf 
but britain and france responded that there would be no dialogue 
with iraq until saddams troops are out of kuwait 
the frenchmen to be released were identified by ina as bouban 
jean ive frank ouzeau gerard wisat laurant lucal christophe

president saddam hussein of iraq says he 
is ready for a dialogue with his international adversaries in the 
persian gulf crisis but he is still tying any settlement to other 
conflicts in the region 
his message sunday addressed to the arab and islamic msses 
represented a departure from previous more bellicose declarations 
he said he wanted to launch a dialogue with france to explore 
the possibility of using president francois mitterrands ideas on 
the crisis as the basis for a settlement 
saddam urged his 1 millionmember army to remain ready to fight 
any foreign attempt to drive iraqi forces from kuwait which they 
invaded aug 2 but in another switch from past speeches not 
once in almost 45 minutes did he renew his pledge never to 
relinquish the emirate he seized two months ago 
responding to saddams overture frances foreign minister said 
france and iraq have not discussed opening negotiations 
any useful discussion can take place only if two conditions 
have been fulfilled the evacuation of kuwait by iraqi troops and 
the release of all the hostages foreign minister roland dumas 
told the french radio network rtl on sunday as of late last month 
4200 westerners remained in iraq and kuwait including an 
undetermined number held at key iraqi military installations 
britain another leading member of the multinational military 
force standing up to saddam also rejected his latest proposals 
there is nothing new in this a foreign office official said 
on condition of anonymity 
saddams message was read over state television and radio by 
announcer mikdad murad and monitored in nicosia the backdrop 
behind murad alternated between a portrait of saddam in a western 
suit and one of him in military uniform praying in front of a 
picture of minarets 
his message marked the birthday of the 7thcentury prophet 
mohammed and was punctuated by lengthy recitations from the koran 
islams holy book 
saddam said reducing tensions could begin if dialogue replaces 
the policy of threats and warnings if the language of peaceful 
politics replaces the policy of troop buildups and threats of the 
use of force 
he withdrew his previous opposition to the involvement of 
foreign powers in the search of a settlement to the dispute 
should the international community be involved in a solution 
to the crisis then the emphasis should be on the initiative of 
aug 12 1990 which underlined that peace could not be 
achieved without the settlement of all the problems of the 
region he said 
on aug 12 saddam linked an kuwaiti settlement to israels 
withdrawal from the occupied territories he has also tied it to a 
syrian pullout in lebanon 
in earlier statements he has also rejected any outside 
involvement insisting the problem is for arabs to resolve 
saddam said sunday withdrawal of foreign forces from the 
lands of najd and hejaz saudi arabia and the arabian gulf and 
ending the blockade of iraq is a slogan for all arabs and 
believers to raise 
but he did not repeat an earlier threat to dislodge these troops 
from the region by force 
in mitterrands speech before the un general assembly a week 
ago he suggested a serious drive toward settling the conflict over 
kuwait in concert with other problems in the region including the 
israeli occupation of arab territories and the lebanese civil war 
mitterrand was the only western leader to link the problems 
the united states has rejected such a connection setting off 
arab accusations that it is applying double standards in the middle 
east toward iraq and israel 
saddam said we view the speech of the french president 
despite certain reservations of being of a different language and 
we hope that our positive interpretation is correct 
it is not important to agree or disagree with this initiative 
or that including that of french president mitterrand 
what is important that a serious dialogue be launched in 
search of a possible just and comprehensive solution that would 
allow peace to prevail 
the iraqi president said we intend to launch contact with the 
french government with the aim of formulating a precise viewpoint 
so that action could be launched on clear and solid 
foundations

the supreme court today killed sioux indian 
tribes legal challenges stemming from their loss through us 
treaties of some 27 million acres of land stretching across three 
states 
the court without comment let stand rulings that the tribes 
waited too long to attack a 1972 plan by congress for distributing 
a 6 million settlement between the tribes and the federal 
government 
under that plan the tribes will receive threefourths of the 
money and 1970 descendants who are not themselves tribal members 
will receive onefourth 
the tribes contended in their 1987 lawsuit that they are 
entitled to 100 percent of the 6 million settlement fund and the 
interest it has earned since 1972 
the dispute has its roots in treaties of 1830 and 1851 in which 
the sisseton and wahpeton sioux ceded to the united states vast 
stretches of land in what now is south dakota iowa and minnesota 
the tribes sued the government about 100 years later contending 
that they had not received just compensation the suit was settled 
and congress in 1968 appropriated the money to pay the settlement 
four years later congress devised the distribution plan but the 
tribes did not challenge it in court until 1987 when the bureau of 
indian affairs indicated the 25 percent set aside for nonmembers 
of the tribes was almost ready for distribution 
us district judge paul hatfield in montana threw out the suit 
ruling that the tribe had only six years to sue after congress 
unveiled the distribution plan 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal last 
february and the tribes then sought help from the nations highest 
court 
the case is sissetonwahpeton sioux vs us 892015

the supreme court today turned down the appeal 
of a kentucky couple who say they were disqualified as adoptive 
parents for a biracial child because they are white 
the justices withut comment let stand state court rulings 
that threw out lisa and ronald wilsons civil rights lawsuit 
against the kentucky cabinet for human resources and several of its 
officials 
the wilsons contend that their racebased disqualification was 
automatic but state officials say the couples race was taken into 
account but was not the controlling factor 
the state agency in august 1984 took legal custody of a 
monthold child maria who had been born to a white woman and a 
black man she was placed in a foster home with a woman known by 
lisa wilson then 24 and single 
lisa started taking maria home with her every weekend and then 
four or five days each week in august 1985 lisa inquired about 
adopting maria 
after a 1986 meeting with cabinet for human resources employee 
brooke darrow lisa received a letter telling her she and ronald 
wilson whom she planned to marry in early 1987 would not be 
considered in selecting marias adoptive parents 
if parental rights are terminated we will be requesting an 
interracial adoptive family since the child is biracialile live in 
an integrated neighborhood and live an 
integrated lifestyle he said 
two months before the wilsons married maria was placed in the 
home of an interracial couple who had been selected as prospective 
adoptive parents 
the wilsons sued in state court contending they had been 
discriminated against 
after a 1988 trial a jury ruled against the wilsons 
the kentucky court of appeals upheld that ruling last year and 
the kentucky supreme court refused to review the wilsons ensuing 
appeal 
in the appeal acted on today the wilsons challenged what they 
called the state agencys automatic racematching of adoptive 
parents and adopted children 
but state officials urged the justices to reject the appeal 
noting that the prospective adoptive parents with whom maria was 
placed had been approved more than a year before lisa wilson first 
inquired about the possibility of adoption 
the case is wilson vs darrow 90123

president bush to the united nations general assembly 
mr president mr secretary general distinguished delegates to 
the united nations it is a great privilege to greet you today as 
we begin what marks a new and historic session of the general 
assembly 
fortyfive years ago while the fires of an epic war still raged 
across two oceans and two continents a small group of men and 
women began a search for hope amid the ruins they gathered in san 
francisco stepping back from the haze and the horror to try to 
shape a new structure that might support an ancient dream 
intensely idealistic and yet tempered by war they sought to 
build a new kind of bridge a bridge between nations a bridge that 
might help carry humankind from its darkest hour to its brightest 
day 
the founding of the united nations embodied our deepest hopes 
for a peaceful world and during the past year we have come closer 
than ever before to realizing those hopes weve seen a century 
sundered by barbed threats and barbed wire give way to a new era of 
peace cooperation and freedom 
the revolution of 89 swept the world almost with a life of its 
own carried by a new breeze of freedom that transformed the 
political climate from central europe to central america and 
touched almost every corner of the globe 
that breeze has been sustained by a now almost universal 
recognition of a simple fundamental truth the human spirit cant 
be locked up forever the truth is people everywhere are motivated 
in much the same way and people everywhere want much the same 
things the chance to live a life of purpose the chance to choose 
a life in which they and their children can learn grow healthy 
worship freely and prosper through the work of their hands their 
hearts and their minds 
were not talking about the power of nations but the power of 
individuals the power to choose the power to risk the power to 
succeed

the supreme court today refused to let the st 
louis postdispatch see some confidential documents in the 
governments corruption investigation of pentagoncontracts 
the court over two dissenting votes let stand a ruling that 
the privacy rights of mcdonnell douglas corp the nations largest 
defense contractor and some of its employees outweigh the publics 
right to know more about the weapons procurement case 
justices byron r white and harry a blackmun voted to hear 
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such 
review 
the justice department investigation called operation ill 
wind began in 1987 and has yielded more than three dozen guilty 
pleas or convictions on fraud and briberyrelated charges 
among the contractors investigated was mcdonnell douglas which 
is based in the st louis area and receives some 9 billion a year 
in pentagon contracts 
the fbi in 1988 conducted a search of defense contractor 
offices including those of mcdonnell douglas and its 
vicepresident thomas gunn search warrants were based on 
information the fbi obtained listening to wiretapped telephone 
conversations 
the postdispatch asked to see sealed documents related to the 
warrants particularly government affidavits that mi the 
company and its employees weighs heavily in favor of the privacy 
interests and nondisclosure 
these search warrant affidavits implicate some individuals 
directly in criminal misconduct others only indirectly the 
appeals court said disclosure could seriously damage their 
reputations and careers 
lawyers for the postdispatch said the appeals court ruling 
created novel rights of privacy that prevail over the first 
amendment interests of the public and the press 
the newspapers appeal said the appeals court ruling held 
without precedent that in preindictment situations privacy 
concerns outweigh access even when as here the government 
favors access 
the case is pulitzer publishing co vs certain interested 
individuals 891974

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether lawyers in noncriminal cases may bar potential jurors 
because of their race 
the justices said they will use the case of an injured black 
construction worker in louisiana to decide whether such racially 
motivated exclusions are prohibited in 982 five years 
after leaving the us marine corps in the interim five years he 
had served in the marine corps ready reserve both as a member of 
the individual ready reserve and the selected marine corps reserve 
all ready reserve members may be called to active duty in the 
event of war or national emergency but individual ready reserve 
members have no required training obligations 
when kolkhorst began his police job he was an irr member and 
therefore had no drill or camp obligations 
since 1979 the 2900member baltimore police department had 
limited to 100 the number of police officers permitted to join an 
active military reserve unit 
the departments policy was motivated by two concerns 
activation of local reserves during civil disturbances or other 
emergencies would deplete the departments manpower to a point that 
would jeopardize public safety 
most reserve training takes place in summer months when 
vacation and other leave requests are at their highest 
kolkhorst subsequently joined a selected reserve unit and 
received orders to report to camp lejeune in north carolina in the 
summer of 1986 when notified of those orders the police 
department told him to quit the active reserves immediately 
he quit but sued claiming the department had violated the 
veterans reemployment rights act 
a federal judge last year ruled that kolkhorst must be allowed 
to join the active reserve unit and ordered the police department 
to pay him 4164 in damages the amount of income and benefits he 
would have earned by participating in the reservist training 
the 4th circuit court upheld that ruling 
the case is tilghman vs kolkhorst 891949

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration its views on a state court ruling that bars 
communities from regulating the use of pesticides 
the court asked justice department lawyers to comment on an 
appeal by the rural town of casey wis the appeal had been 
supported by state officials 
the justices are not expected to say whether they will grant 
review to the towns appeal until hearing from the government 
lawyers which could take months 
the wisconsin supreme court ruled in march that local regulation 
of pesticide use is preempted by the federal insecticide 
fungicide and rodenticide act of 1972 
opponents of local regulation argue that towns and cities cannot 
cope with everchanging scientific advances and the complexities of 
pest control but local officials say they are the only ones 
familiar with local conditions and hazards 
the wisconsin court said it did not weigh the merits of the 
policy dispute relying instead on congress intent in passing the 
federal insecticide law 
we conclude the preemptive action of the congress 
deprived the town of casey of its police power to regulate 
pesticides the state court said 
officials in casey a town of some 400 people in wisconsins 
northwest corner required permits for pesticide use and aerial 
spraying the local law imposed fines of up to 5000 for each 
violation 
the ordinance was challenged by a group that included farmers 
and tree growers and a state judge declared it invalid in 1986 
the case is wisconsin public intervenor vs mortier 891905

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration for its views of a ruling that could help elect 
blacks to a florida county commission and school board 
the court wants to know what justice department lawyers think 
about an appeal by liberty county fla officials who said a lower 
court went too far in seeking to protect the voting rights of the 
countys black minority 
the governments comments could take months to reach the 
justices who arent expected to say until then whether they will 
grant review to the liberty county case 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in april ruled in favor 
of black voters challenging the atlarge method of electing 
commissioners and school board members in liberty county 
blacks want members of the two bodies elected by districtwide 
voting one of the five county districts has a majority of 
votingage blacks while blacks comprise only 11 percent of the 
county population 
a black never has been elected to the county commission or 
school board each with five members 
the 11th circuit court stopped short of eliminating countywide 
elections but it sent the case back to a federal judge with 
instructions that may lead to districtwide voting the appeals 
courts 10 members were evenly divided over exactly how to 
implement its ruling 
the decision relied heavily on a 1986 supreme court ruling that 
made it easier for minorities to challenge redistricting plans that 
may dilute their voting strength 
the high court in that case struck down a north carolina 
legislative redistricting plan as a violation of the voting rights 
act 
congress in 1982 amended the 1965 voting rights law to eliminate 
the need for minorities to prove intentional bias when challenging 
districting plans the new law requires only that minorities show 
that districting plans have the effect of diluting their voting 
strength regardless of intent 
in the liberty county case the 11th circuit court said there is 
sufficient evidence the black population is concentrated and 
politically cohesive and that the vote is racially polarized 
an opinion signed by five judges on the 11th circuit said 
black voters have never had an opportunity to elect a black 
representative despite their manifest preference for those black 
candidates that have presented themselves six futile elections is 
enough 
a separate concurring opinion signed by five other judges on the 
appeals court expressed reservations about their colleagues 
opinion they said that opinion would create a right to 
proportional representation for all large compact and cohesive 
minority groups 
the case is liberty county vs solomon 90102

let me also emphasize that all of us here at the un hope 
military forces will never have to be used we seek a peaceful 
outcome a diplomatic outcome and one more thing in the 
aftermath of iraqs unconditional departure from kuwait i truly 
believe that there may be opportunities for iraq and kuwait to 
believe that there may be opportunities for iraq and kuwait to 
settle their differences permanently for the states of the gulf 
themselves to build new arrangements for stability and for all the 
states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that 
divides the arabs from israel but the worlds key task now 
first and always must be to demonstrate that aggression will not 
be tolerated or rewarded 
through the un security council iraq has been judged by a 
jury of its peers the very nations of the earth today the 
regime stands isolated and out of step with the times separated 
from the civilized world not by space but by centuries 
iraqs unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era a 
dark relic from a dark time it has plundered kuwait terrorized 
innocent citizens and held even diplomats hostage iraq and its 
leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and 
destruction but this outrageous disregard for basic human rights 
does not come as a total surprise thousands of iraqis have been 
executed on political and religious grounds and even more through 
a genocidal poison gas war waged against iraqs own kurdish 
villagers 
as a world community we must act not only to deter the use of 
inhuman weapons like mustard and nerve gas but to eliminate the 
weapons entirely that is why one year ago i came to the general 
assembly with new proposals to banish these terrible weapons from 
the face of the earth 
i promised the united states would destroy over 98 percent of 
its stockpile in the first eight years of a chemical weapons ban 
treaty and 100 percent all of them in 10 years if all nations 
with chemical weapons capabilities sign the treaty 
weve stood by those promises in june the us and the soviet 
union signed a landmark agreement to halt production and to 
destroy the vast majority of our stockpiles today us chemical 
weapons are being destroyed 
but time is running out this is not a merely bilateral concern 
the gulf crisis proves how important it is to act together and to 
act now to conclude an absolute worldwide ban on these weapons 
we must also redouble our efforts to stem the spread of nuclear 
weapons biological weapons and the ballistic missiles that can 
rain destruction upon distant peoples 
the united nations can help bring about a new day a day when 
these kinds of terrible weapons and the terrible despots who 
would use them are both a thing of the past it is in our hands 
to leave these dark machines behind in the dark ages where they 
belong and to press forward to cap a historic movement towards a 
new world order and a long era of peace 
we have a vision of a new partnership of nations that transcends 
the cold war a partnership based on consultation cooperation and 
collective action especially through international and regional 
organizations a partnership united by principle and the rule of 
law and supported by an equitable sharing of both cost and 
commitment a partnership whose goals are to increase democracy 
increase prosperity increase the peace and reduce arms

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration whether state lemon laws should be allowed to 
give buyers of chronically defective automobiles more legal 
protection than they receive under federal law 
the court invited justice department lawyers to comment on 
arguments by domestic and foreign car makers that such state laws 
impermissibly conflict with federal law 
the justices are not expected to say whether they will grant 
review to the manufacturers appeal until hearing from the 
government which could take months 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled against the car 
makers when it upheld new yorks lemon law last march 
congress did not intend to occupy the field of informal 
dispute resolution mechanisms and it is possible to comply with 
both the new york and federal schemes the appeals court ruled in 
giving car consumers a significant victory 
congress in 1975 passed the magnusonmoss warranty act aimed at 
giving consumers more information about the warranties provided on 
the new cars they buy the law does not require that a warranty be 
provided but requires that if one is given it not be misleading 
the law also permits car manufacturers to require consumers with 
complaints about the cars they bought to resort to some informal 
type of dispute resolution such as arbitration before suing 
the federal law was not successful in resolving consumer 
problems with chronically defective cars and many states responded 
by assing their own lemon laws 
the new york law enacted in 1983 requires manufacturers to 
give consumers full refunds or to replace defective cars if unable 
to repair the same problem after four tries or if a car is out of 
service for 30 days or more within the first two years or 18000 
miles of operation 
the law was amended in 1986 to make any arbitration decision 
binding on car manufacturers but not on consumers and to entitle 
consumers to oral arbitration hearings 
the motor vehicle manufacturers association and the association 
of international automobile manufacturers sued over the 1986 
amendments a federal judge ruled that the amendments are 
preempted by the magnusonmoss act but the 2nd circuit court 
reversed that ruling 
the case is motor vehicles manufacturers association vs abrams

and as we look to the future the calendar offers up a 
convenient milestone a signpost by which to measure our progress 
as a community of nations 
the year 2000 marks a turning point beginning not only the turn 
of the decade not only the turn of the century but also the turn 
of the millennium 
and ten years from now as the 55th session of the general 
assembly begins you will again find many of us in this hall our 
hair a bit more gray perhaps a bit less spring in our walk but 
you will not find us with any less hope or idealism or any less 
confidence in the ultimate triumph of humankind 
i see a world of open borders open trade and most 
importantly open minds a world that celebrates the common 
heritage that belongs to all the worlds people taking pride not 
just in hometown or homeland but in humanity itself 
i see a world touched by a spirit like that of the olympics 
based not on competition thats driven by fear but sought out of 
joy and exhilaration and a true quest for excellence 
i see a world where democracy continues to win new friends and 
convert old foes and where the americas north central and south 
can provide a model for the future for all humankind the 
worlds first completely democratic hemisphere 
and i see a world building on the emerging new model of european 
unity not just europe but the whole world whole and free 
this is precisely why the present aggression in the gulf is a 
menace not only to one regions security but to the entire worlds 
vision of our future it threatens to turn the dream of a new 
international order into a grim nightmare of anarchy in which the 
law of the jungle supplants the law of nations 
that is why the united nations reacted with such historic unity 
and resolve and that is why this challenge is a test we cannot 
afford to fail i am confident we will prevail success too will 
have lasting consequences reinforcing civilized standards of 
international conduct setting a new precedent in international 
cooperation brightening the prospects for our vision of the 
future 
there are ten more years until the century is out ten more 
years to put the struggles of the 20th century permanently behind 
us ten more years to help launch a new partnership of nations 
and throughout those ten years and beginning now the un has a 
new and vital role in building towards that partnership last 
years general assembly showed how we can make greater progress 
towards a more pragmatic and successful un and for the first 
time the un security council is beginning to work as it was 
designed to work 
now is the time to set aside old debates old procedures old 
controversies and old resolutions its time to replace polemic 
attacks with pragmatic action 
we have shown that the un can count on the collective strength 
of the international community we have shown that the un can 
rise to the challenge of aggression as its founders hoped it 
would and now in this time of testing we must also show that the 
un is the place to build international support and consensus for 
meeting the other challenges we face

president bush today condemned iraqi leader saddam hussein for 
his invasion of kuwait but he also offered an opening to baghdad 
suggesting that an iraqi withdrawal could lead to settlement of the 
arabisraeli conflict 
also today iraq ordered the release of nine french nationals in 
its second conciliatory gesture in as many days and in israel the 
army said it will give out gas masks to every israeli to protect 
them in the event of a war 
on sunday saddam hussein urged an international dialogue and 
mentioned france as a possible partner us french and british 
officials rejected the offer saying they wouldnt talk until iraq 
withdraws from kuwait 
the nations allied against iraq meanwhile were laying the 
groundwork for possible military action 
us and soviet officials were reported sunday to be drafting 
new un resolutions that would authorize the use of force against 
iraq if the unordered economic blockade fails to force saddam 
out of kuwait 
in his address to the un general assembly today bush mixed 
harsh language against saddam with an overture for a resolution of 
the 2monthold persian gulf crisis 
iraqs unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era a 
dark relic from a dark time bush said in his prepared remarks 
but he added we seek a peaceful outcome a diplomatic outcome 
in the aftermath of iraqs unconditional departure from 
kuwait i truly believe that there may be opportunities he said 
for iraq and kuwait to settle their differences permanently for 
the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for 
stability and for all the states and peoples of the region to 
settle the conflict that divides the arabs from israel 
in past speeches saddam has linked an iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait to an israeli pullout from the occupied territories and a 
syrian withdrawal from lebanon he repeated those conditions 
sunday 
in other developments iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati and his saudi counterpart prince saud alfaisal met in 
new york to discuss resuming diplomatic relations and ending a 
2year rift irans official islamic republic news agency said 
today 
the agency monitored in nicosia said in a dispatch from new 
york that the meeting took place sunday at un heaquarters 
it was the first time senior officials from the two countries 
have met since the saudis broke off ties in april 1988 citing 
terrorism and subversion it was the most positive sign yet that 
they may be moving toward rapprochement 
thousands of french troops joined the usled multinational 
force in saudi arabia on sunday and us and british warships in 
the persian gulf stopped and searched an indian ship carrying 
refugees from kuwait the refugee ship was not found to be in 
violation of the un embargo 
european and israeli military analysts said the likelihood of 
war has grown significantly as sanctions and a hostile world push 
saddam into a corner with no diplomatic escape 
i think another six to eight weeks is available to prevent a 
conflict but after that it becomes almost inevitable said paul 
beaver publisher of the respected janes defense weekly in an 
interview in london 
such reports prompted the israeli army to announce today that it 
will begin distributing gas masks to israels 47 million citizens 
next week 
the announcement follows threats by saddam to attack israel 
including one in which he said he would burn half the jewish state 
with chemical weapons 
the official iraqi news agency said today that saddam has 
ordered the release of nine french nationals they are believed to 
be among the westerners saddam has ordered placed at strategic 
sites to serve as shields to prevent potential western attacks 
on sunday in a speech on iraqi state tv and radio saddam said 
he no longer opposes involvement by foreign powers in seeking a 
settlement to the crisis which was precipitated by iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
saddams speech read by an announcer said tensions can be 
reduced if dialogue replaces the policy of threats and warnings 
if the language of peaceful politics replaces the policy of troop 
buildups and threats of the use of force 
however he again linked any solution to an israeli pullout from 
the occupied territories and he said iraq would defend kuwait if 
necessary 
saddam said he wanted to open a dialogue with france to explore 
the possibility of using president francois mitterrands ideas on 
negotiating a broad middle east peace as basis for a settlement 
he said he viewed mitterrands proposals as being of a 
different language than past foreign denunciations of iraq 
adding we hope our positive interpretation is correct 
in a un speech on sept 24 mitterrand suggested settling the 
conflict over kuwait together with other regional problems that 
might include israels occupation of arab territories and the 
lebanese civil war 
but he also insisted that if iraq wants to see foreign military 
forces leave the region it must quit kuwait and release the 
estimated 2200 western hostages it holds 
responding to the overture france britain and the united 
states said they would not negotiate without an iraqi withdrawal 
from kuwait 
it still doesnt address the two basic un resolutions which 
are withdrawal from kuwait and restoration of the government 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater

construction spending stalled in august 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait after posting its first gain in 
four months in july the government said monday only an increase 
in government projects kept overall spending from declining 
confidence is the major problem we have acrosstheboard right 
now said daryl delano an economist with cahners economics in 
newton mass confidence is certainly at the lowest point weve 
seen in a long time 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government spending was virtually unchanged at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4425 billion following a revised 03 
percent increase in july 
the oftenvolatile government spending jumped 61 percent 
offsetting declines of 12 percent in residential construction and 
43 percent in nonresidential outlays 
the residential sector was very weak delano said of the 
1869 billion spending rate for single and multifamily 
buildings its consistent with everything weve seen in that 
sector 
residential spending has fallen for five straight months 
singlefamily spending was down 13 percent to an annual rate of 
1085 billion following a 12 percent loss a month earlier 
apartment construction was up 11 percent to 19 billion after a 
05 percent gain in july 
but nonresidential spending which advanced 42 percent in 
july fell 43 percent to annual rate of 1048 billion in august 
and more than erased the gain industrial spending which jumped 
162 percent in july slipped back 127 percent 
theres a lot more weakness to come delano said its 
consistent with a lack of confidence and a waitandsee attitude 
government spending totaled an annual rate of 1151 billion 
following a 27 percent decline the previous month spending on 
highways and streets led the advance with a 90 percent gain 
the 03 percent increase in construction spending in july was 
the first advance since a 04 percent gain in march spending fell 
28 percent in april 02 percent in may and 06 percent in june 
in addition to consumer caution over the state of the economy 
and the persian gulf crisis analysts have attributed the general 
weakness in the construction industry to high interest rates tight 
lending requirements and in some areas overbuilding resulting in 
high vacancies 
the weakness has been illustrated in recent labor department 
reports showing the loss of nearly 100000 construction jobs in the 
past three months this included 40000 jobs after a seasonal 
adjustment in august the sixth consecutive monthly decline 
construction spending in august was 20 percent above the 4339 
billion in the same month of 1989

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration whether states should be allowed to regulate the 
shipment of hazardous substances by railroads 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before deciding whether to review a ruling that such ohio 
regulations are preempted by federal laws governing rail safety 
the justices are not expected to say whether they will review 
the ohio case until hearing from the government lawyers which 
could take months 
ohios appeal to the high court was supported by nine other 
states a nationwide alliance of state regulators and a railroad 
union group they urged the justices to overturn 6th us circuit 
court of appeals ruling that invalidated ohios hazardous substance 
controls 
leaving regulation of such shipments to the federal government 
is an invitation to disaster the state officials said 
when rail hazardous materials accidents occur the results can 
be catastrophic the officials said they noted that billions of 
tons of dangerous substances are transported each year and said 
federal agencies lack the staffs or will to carry out adequate 
inspections and enforcement 
supporting the ohio appeal were arizona california louisiana 
missouri montana nevada tennessee texas and washington the 
national association of regulatory utility commissioners 
representing officials in all 50 states also urged the high court 
to step in 
the railway labor executives association representing the 
railroad unions said the number of accidents involving trains 
carrying hazardous material increased from 351 in 1987 to 517 last 
year 
the unions accused the federal railroad administration of doing 
little to correct the problem leaving regulation to the railroads 
themselves 
the unions said that if the 6th circuit ruling were to apply 
nationwide all railroads that transport hazardous materials and 
toxic substances can effectively avoid compliance with any and all 
regulation 
the 6th circuit court has jurisdiction in ohio kentucky 
michigan and tennessee 
the appeals court last april ruled in favor of four railroads 
that challenged ohios regulations the railroads are csx 
transportation inc conrail norfolk and western and grand trunk 
western 
the appeals court said the federal railroad safety act strictly 
limits the power of states to regulate rail safety the aw 
generally bars states from duplicating federal safety rules the 
appeals court said 
but ohio and the other states argued that a second federal law 
specifically gives the states power to control shipments of 
hazardous material by any form of transportation including 
railroads 
ohio officials said that law the hazardous materials 
transportation act established a dual system of federalstate 
regulation state rules must be consistent with federal regulations 
under the law the ohio attorney generals office said 
ohio enacted its hazardous material control law after a 1986 
accident in which 15 cars on a baltimore amp ohio train derailed in 
miamisburg ohio a tank car containing phosphorous ruptured 
causing 35 million in property damage and prompting evacuation of 
some 40000 people 
a report on the accident by the national transportation safety 
board said the federal railroad administration had not exerted 
sufficient control over tank car safety 
the case is public utilities commission of ohio vs csx 
transportation inc 9095

in the ohio sentencing case ediberto huertas fatally stabbed 
ralph harris jr in lorain ohio on june 7 1986 he now is 
serving a life prison term for the crime 
on leave from the air force harris was spending the night with 
elba ortiz huertas who had fathered two children with ms ortiz 
allegedly warned harris he would waste him if he continued to 
see the woman 
a state jury imposed the death sentence after hearing evidence 
that harris parents wanted huertas to die for his crime elizabeth 
harris the victims mother also testified emotionally she was 
proud of her churchgoing son and that his death had devastated his 
son 
the supreme court in 1987 ruled that such victimimpact 
evidence should not be considered by sentencing juries 
and last year the justices voted 54 that a jury generally may 
not be told about the victims character the court said a south 
carolina murderer unfairly was sentenced to die because the jury 
heard such testimony 
that ruling was written by justice william j brennan who has 
since retired 
the four justices who dissented from last years decision said 
then they were ready to overturn the 1987 ruling and permit 
victimimpact testimony in criminal sentencing 
the ohio supreme court relied on both us supreme court rulings 
when last may it reduced huertas death sentence to life in prison 
prosecutors argued that the jury should have been allowed to 
consider the impact of harris murder on his family because huertas 
and harris had been high school friends and huertas knew the 
family the killer was aware of the impact his crime would have on 
the family they said 
but the ohio supreme court said such evidence is relevant to the 
sentence only when the evidence has a connection to the 
defendants personal responsibility and moral guilt 
otherwise the state court said such testimony undermines the 
defendants right to be sentenced by an impartial jury 
the case is ohio vs huertas 891944

a state district judge ruled today that the ousted 
dallas police chiefs perjury trial belongs in a lower court 
state district judge joe kendall transferred mack vines trial 
to dallas county criminal court saying his court lacks 
jurisdiction because the perjury indictment does not allege 
official misconduct 
nothing in the indictment in this case distinguishes the 
charge in this case from that against any other member of the 
general public kendall said 
dallas county assistant district attorney ted steinke said the 
transfer to criminal court would have no bearing at all on the 
case 
steinke who argued today that kendalls court had jurisdiction 
in the case said the lack of mention of vines role as a public 
official was not an omission in the indictment but he refused 
comment on whether it should have been included 
this was the courts decision to make we have no quarrel with 
it steinke said 
vines lawyer bill boyd praised the ruling 
its certainly not bad for vines and its good for him in 
that were clearly dealing with a misdemeanor he said 
obviously on the advice of my counsel i am satisfied 
vines said i guess we just go on from here to a misdemeanor 
court 
state district courts have jurisdiction over felony charges 
while criminal courts handle misdemeanors 
steinke said the main difference is that six criminal court 
jurors will hear the case as opposed to 12 in state court 
vines pleaded innocent sept 12 to the perjury charge hours 
later he was fired by city manager jan hart 
the misdemeanor charge alleges that vines lied to a panel 
investigating a police shooting about a conversation he had with 
his assistant greg holliday aug 2 vines has maintained his 
innocence 
holliday said vines called him late at night and tried to 
influence hollidays testimony before the special panel which he 
was scheduled to give the next day holliday told ms hart of the 
conversation and she suspended both men with pay holliday later 
was reinstated

the supreme court today permitted the 
prosecution of an alleged honduran drug dealer who said us 
officials kidnapped and tortured him 
the court over one dissenting vote rejected arguments that the 
defendant should be freed because us officials violated 
international law and the us and honduras constitutions 
only justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals in february refused to bar 
prosecution of juan ramon mattaballesteros who faces drug charges 
in arizona and california and was sentenced in a federal court in 
florida to three years in prison for an earlier escape 
matta escaped from the eglin air force base prison in florida in 
1971 and fled to his native honduras which does not extradite its 
own citizens 
he was arrested by honduran authorities at his home in 
tegucigalpa on april 5 1988 and was turned over to us marshals 
matta said the marshals who took him to a federal prison in 
marion ill beat him severely and burned him with a stun gun that 
uses electric pulses to immobilize victims 
us officials denied those allegations and said any 
mistreatment matta suffered while in custody was the work of his 
honduran captors 
matta was transferred from illinois to florida where he was 
convicted of escaping from federal custody 
the 7th circuit court ruled that even if mattas rights were 
violated he is not entitled to be freed 
for the past 100 years the supreme court has consistently 
held that the manner in which a defendant is brought to trial does 
not affect the ability of the government to try him the appeals 
court said 
if matta was mistreated the appeals court said his remedy is 
to sue the government and the officials who allegedly violated his 
rights 
a related issue has been raised by the arrest of a mexican 
suspect in the 1985 murder of us drug agent enrique camarena 
a federal judge has ruled that us officials violated an 
extradition treaty with mexico when they seized dr humberto 
alvarez machain a gynecologist accused of administering drugs to 
camarena while the agent was tortured 
justice department lawyers are appealing the judges ruling 
the mexican government protested alvarezs arrest in contrast 
to mattas capture in which the honduran government cooperated 
the supreme court last february bolstered the fight against drug 
smuggling and terrorism when it ruled that us agents do not need 
warrants to search in other countries the court upheld the 
warrantless search of the home of a suspected mexican drug 
smuggler 
the case acted on today is mattaballesteros v henman 891797

impeached former federal judge alcee 
hastings is trying to make a comeback in public life running for 
florida secretary of state with the same defiance he displayed 
toward prosecutors and us senators 
hastings faces exnewspaperman jim minter for the democratic 
nomination for secretary of state in the only statewide race in 
tuesdays primary runoff election in florida 
a lot of people really do know that i took a political hatchet 
in the face hastings says of his impeachment which came despite 
his acquittal in court on bribery charges i will not be made 
into some kind of clown 
the 53yearold former judge removed from office by the us 
senate in 1989 finished second to minter ina threeway primary 
that also featured former ku klux klan grand dragon john paul 
rogers who got more than a quarter of a million votes 
polls show minter leading hastings by 11 percentage points but 
more than a third of those questioned were undecided wellfinanced 
republican incumbent jim smith would beat either candidate in the 
nov 6 general election the polling data indicates 
low voter turnout for tuesdays runoff could benefit hastings 
who has picked up support from the states labor unions and has a 
strong base among minority voters in his miami home dot joyce 
director of the division of elections predicted a miserable 
turnout tuesday that might reach 20 percent if the weather is good 
hastings who decided to run for secretary of state after a 
brief campaign for governor was floridas first black federal 
judge when appointed by president carter in 1979 
the senate ousted hastings from the federal bench for conspiring 
to obtain a 150000 payoff involving the alleged fixing of court 
cases a friend of hastings william borders was convicted of 
bribery conspiracy in the case but hastings was acquitted in a 
1983 jury trial 
the impeachment proceeding gives new meaning to double 
jeopardy and renders a severe blow to the jury system 
hastings declared after the senate removed him from office 11 
months ago 
minter 52 resigned as an editorial writer and columnist for 
the tallahassee democrat to seek his first political office he 
cites his experience as a speechwriter for former gov reubin askew 
and as an aide to exsecretary of state george firestone to show he 
knows his way around the capitol 
minter who has picked up nearly every newspaper endorsement 
has directed his lowbudget campaign toward those he calls good 
government folks such as political activists and 
environmentalists 
its going to be a very close race and it depends entirely on 
the turnout minter said if the good government folks dont 
turn out the democrats are going to wind up with a strange 
bedfellow 
hastings bristles at the comment pointing out that he is the 
only candidate who was selected by a president for a federal 
office the exjudge also said the states newspaper editorial 
boards havent treated him fairly 
they formed their judgments without even hearing from me he 
said i will beat the living daylights out of every daily 
newspaper and prove they cannot elect people 
hastings has proposed abolishing the independently elected state 
cabinet as too cumbersome even though he seeks a seat on it and 
he has suggested that legalized casino gambling might help solve 
the states budget problems 
the secretary of state is floridas top elections official and 
oversees corporate charters and state records minter and hastings 
have called for campaign finance reform and both have outlined 
positions on the environment education and other issues that face 
the cabinet which makes a wide range of executive decisions

the world remains a dangerous place and our security and 
wellbeing often depends in part on events occurring far away we 
need serious international cooperative efforts to make headway on 
threats to the environment on terrorism on managing the debt 
burden on fighting the scourge of international drug trafficking 
and on refugee and peacekeeping efforts around the world 
but the world also remains a hopeful place calls for democracy 
and human rights are being reborn everywhere these calls are an 
expression of support for the values enshrined in the un charter 
they encourage our hopes for a more stable more peaceful more 
prosperous world 
free elections are the foundation of democratic government and 
can produce dramatic successes as we have seen in namibia and 
nicaragua and the time has come to structure the un role in such 
efforts more formally and so today i propose that the united 
nations establish a special coordinator for electoral assistance 
to be assisted by a un electoral commission comprised of 
distinguished experts from around the world 
as with free elections we also believe that universal un 
membership for all states is central to the future of this 
organization and to the new partnership weve discussed in 
support of this principle and in conjunction with un efforts to 
reduce regional tensions the united states fully supports un 
membership for the republic of korea we do so without prejudice to 
the ultimate objective of reunification of the korean peninsula 
and without opposition to simultaneous membership for the 
democratic peoples republic of korea 
building on these and other initiatives we must join together 
in a new compact all of us to bring the united nations into the 
21st century and i call today for a major longterm effort to do 
this we should build on the success of our distinguished secretary 
general my longtime friend and colleague javier perez de cuellar 
we should strive for greater effectiveness and efficiency of the 
un 
the united states is committed to playing its part helping to 
maintain global security promoting democracy and prosperity my 
administration is fully committed to supporting the united nations 
and to paying what we are obliged to pay by our commitment to the 
charter international peace and security and international 
freedom and prosperity require no less 
the world must know and understand from this hour from this 
day from this hall we step forth with a new sense of purpose a 
new sense of possibilities we stand together prepared to swim 
upstream to march uphill to tackle the tough challenges as they 
come not only as the united nations but as the nations of the 
world united 
let it be said of the final decade of the 20th century this was 
a time when humankind came into its own when we emerged from the 
grit and the smoke of the industrial age to bring about a 
revolution of the spirit and of the mind and began a journey into 
a new day a new age and a new partnership of nations 
the un is now fulfilling its promise as the worlds parliament 
of peace i congratulate you i support you and i wish you 
godspeed in the challenges ahead

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether unfit prison living conditions may amount to cruel and 
unusual punishment when there is no evidence officials acted 
maliciously 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by an ohio inmate who 
accused officials of being indifferent to overcrowding 
ratinfested kitchens freezing cold oppressive heat and other 
miserable conditions 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals in january threw out a 
suit by pearly wilson a prisoner in the hocking correctional 
facility in nelsonville ohio 
wilson said prison officials violated the eighth amendment to 
the constitution which forbids cruel and unusual punishment 
he said the inmates were in cramped cells subject to excessive 
noise foul lavatories and housed with the physically and mentally 
ill the prison is frigid in winter and stifling in summer he 
added 
but the appeals court said wilson did not demonstrate that 
officials have engaged in persistent malicious cruelty at 
worst the state is guilty of negligence and that does not prove 
any constitutional violation in such circumstances the appeals 
court said 
wilson argued that evidence of deliberate indifference is enough 
to warrant intervention by the federal courts to order states to 
improve living conditions 
he also said the 6th circuit court ruling conflicts with 
decisions by other federal appeals courts 
ohio officials in urging the high court to reject wilsons 
appeal said the inmate filed more that 70 lawsuits against the 
state since 1976 almost all them frivolous or premature 
the officials also said there is ample evidence the state tried 
to improve conditions at the facility 
the case is wilson vs seiter 897376

the us supreme court hears arguments 
tuesday in a case that could define the federal judiciarys duties 
and responsibilities after a school system is declared 
desegregated 
in the long run up to 500 school districts nationwide could be 
affected by the high courts decision say lawyers for both sides 
in the case its not known when the court will rule 
the question before the court is whether the oklahoma city 
school boards 1985 decision to abandon forced busing will lead the 
district away from a desegregated or unitary system 
us district judge luther bohanon ruled in 1985 that the 
federal court could not intervene to stop the boards neighborhood 
school plan which abandoned forced busing for students in 
kindergarten through fourth grades students in upper grades are 
still bused 
bohanon reasoned that since he had declared the oklahoma city 
district desegregated in 1977 the federal courts no longer had 
jurisdiction 
the naacp appealed and the 10th us circuit court of appeals 
reversed bohanon the school district appealed to the supreme 
court 
the 10th circuit said federal court supervision in such cases 
extends beyond the termination of the wrongdoing it said the 
oklahoma city school board had a continuing duty to refrain from 
any action that would weaken racial balance in the public schools 
and ordered bohanon to study alternatives to maintain racially 
balanced elementary schools 
school superintendent arthur stellar maintains that no 
segregation results from the neighborhood school plan 
steller said there are no identifiably white schools left in the 
district but admits that 10 of the 58 elementary schools are 90 
percent or more black 
he blamed that on the fact that the neighborhoods are not 
entirely integrated but he added if the present trends 
continue they would become more and more integrated 
i think ideally we would live in a world where schools 
churches and neighborhoods would all be integrated unfortunately 
thats not the situation in which we live steller said 
not everyone agrees the system is desegregated 
we have 32 elementary schools in oklahoma city that are 
racially identifiable and by racially identifiable i mean 90 to 98 
percent one race or the other said roosevelt milton president 
of the local chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
milton said the neighborhood plan has shortchanged blacks 
id say essentially were getting inexperienced educators and 
a lack of adequate books and supplies and i think relegating a 
very high number of socioeconomically deprived students into the 
same school he said 
the case has spanned nearly three decades 
in october 1961 al dowell a black optometrist filed a 
lawsuit contending his son robert was denied admission to a 
predominantly white high school he alleged a quota system was used 
to keep black enrollment at predominantly white schools to a 
minimum and that there was a double standard for the two races 
nearly two years later bohanon ordered the district to take 
extensive steps to bring racial balance to the schools in the 
197273 school year courtordered busing began and thousands of 
children were transported throughout a district where only 251 
percent of the students were black and 749 percent were white 
about 5000 children rode school buses before bohanons 1972 
busing order that number jumped by 15000 for the 197273 school 
year according to minutes from school board meetings 
many whites left the school district for the suburbs from an 
enrollment of 68904 in 1971 the district dropped to 59241 the 
next year it was down to only 37735 pupils in the school year 
just completed 
white students were the minority last year 447 percent of the 
total enrollment black enrollment was up to 40 percent while the 
remaining 153 percent was listed as spanish american indian or 
oriental 
six years after the forced busing began bohanon ruled that it 
had achieved its objective he declared the oklahoma city school 
district to be desegregated and ended court supervision 
school officials continued the busing until the 198586 school 
term when the neighborhood school concept was implemented

the supreme court today refused to force 
states to allow some public access to juvenile court hearings or 
records 
the justices without comment let stand kentucky court rulings 
that upheld the mandatory secrecy of the states juvenile courts 
kentuckys policy was challenged in 1988 by the courierjournal 
and louisville times after a newspaper reporter was forbidden to 
see transcripts of a juvenile court hearing 
the dispute arose over the case of a 16yearold youth 
identified in court records by the initials ftp who fatally 
beat another juvenile who lived in the same staterun facility 
after ftp was charged state prosecutors sought to have his 
case transferred out of juvenile court so he could be tried as an 
adult 
in response lawyers for ftp asked a juvenile court judge to 
declare the states transfer law unconstitutional the judge did 
so 
it was the hearing on the transfer laws constitutionality that 
the louisville newspapers sought to attend they later sought to 
obtain transcripts and records from the hearing 
a trial judge ruled that the juvenile court proceedings must 
remain secret and the kentucky court of appeals upheld that ruling 
last year 
the kentucky supreme court refused to hear the newspapers 
appeal last april 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the newspapers argued 
that past rulings by the nations highest court established a 
presumption of openness in criminal trials and pretrial 
proceedings 
there is simply no reason why proceedings which the 
constitution would require to be presumptively open if the accused 
was an 18yearold can be mandatorily closed when the accused is 
17 the appeal said 
juvenile courts in kentucky are not required or even allowed 
to consider closure on a casebycase basis inquiring into the 
existence and intensity of interests supporting closure it 
added 
the case is courierjournal vs ftp 90107

father sergio giuramondos quest for inner peace 
provides the drama on screen in the taviani brothers night 
sun off screen finding the actor to play father sergio was an 
equally difficult task 
we had an image in our head and we couldnt find someone in 
italy or in france said paulo taviani in a press conference with 
brother vittorio after the films recent screening at the new york 
film festival one day we saw a picture of english actor 
julian sands and just from his face his body we thought he would 
be right 
we met with him for a long time we had him read parts from 
other films of ours it was a little difficult at first not to have 
an actor whos italian but its happened many many times perhaps 
because we belong to an underdeveloped country that has to borrow 
bits of culture from others joked paulo whose previous films 
with vittorio include the night of san lorenzo and good 
morning babylon 
night sun is based on father sergio a short novel by 
leo tolstoy and takes place in 18thcentury naples the original 
story was based in 19th century st petersburg 
as a boy the intense sergio wishes to serve his king and 
eventually receives his wish but the king pushes him into a 
disastrous engagement with the beautiful cristina nastassja 
kinski who reveals that for a year she was the monarchs 
mistress 
an enraged sergio storms out of her home and decides to become a 
monk the monastery also proves unsatisfactory too close to the 
temptations of the secular world and sergio chooses to become a 
hermit 
even then his will is tested he is twice visited by women who 
desire him sexually and receives unwanted fame when villagers 
believe he is responsible for making a dumb boy speak the film 
ends with sergio wandering from village to village 
the film centers on the predicament of ones desire for 
privacy and ones desire to interact with others explained 
vittorio taviani 
a constant was a desire to tell a beautiful story added 
paulo the most important stories such as the iliad often 
have a journey as their theme 
night sun runs for 112 minutes and does not have an american 
distributor 
the new york film festival opened sept 21 with millers 
crossing and closes oct 7 with the nasty girl

iran and syria have agreed on a plan to 
free western hostages in lebanon a beirut newspaper reported 
today 
also today the israelibacked south lebanon army said it freed 
40 shiite moslem detainees to mark the birthday of the prophet 
mohammed the demands of the shiites holding most of the 13 
westerners missing in lebanon include the release of the 340 
moslems held by the south lebanon army 
the westerners comprise six americans four britons and two west 
germans and a missing italian most are believed held by shiite 
factions linked to hezbollah tehrans main ally in lebanon 
the conservative daily addiyar citing unidentified diplomatic 
sources said syrian president hafez assad worked out the accord to 
free the westerners in talks in tehran last week with president 
hashemi rafsanjani of iran 
the iranian embassy in beirut and the headquarters of the syrian 
security force in west beirut declined comment on the newspaper 
report 
in new york white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
we welcome the release of the 40 shiite muslim prisoners in 
lebanon 
it is consistent with our position that for humanitarian 
reasons all persons being detained without legal basis in the 
middle east should be released immediately our particular concern 
is quite naturally the americans being held hostage in lebanon and 
we call upon all parties to use their influence to effect their 
immediate and unconditional release 
as president bush has indicated the release of american 
hostages would help improve our relations with countries 
contributing to that release 
there have been other indications that efforts to free the 
captives were gathering momentum amid the persian gulf crisis 
triggered by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
irans ambassador to pakistan a country used by the americans 
as a conduit into tehran said shortly before assads visit to the 
iranian capital that some hostages could be freed soon and iran 
and britain restored relations last week ending a 19month rift 
addiyar said the releases would begin not with the freeing of a 
westerner held in lebanon but with iran freeing british businessman 
roger cooper within the next few days to warm up the newly 
resumed diplomatic ties between britain and iran 
cooper has been in prison in tehran since 1985 iran says he is 
a spy and was convicted last year but has never disclosed his 
sentence 
addiyar said that after coopers release proiranian shiites 
in lebanon would free their british hostages 
shiite political and religious leaders have said privately that 
two of the missing britons world war ii flying ace jack mann and 
writer alec collett have never figured in negotiations to free 
hostages these talks have involved only anglican church envoy 
terry waite and journalist john mccarthy they said 
addiyar said the third stage of the plan would be the start of 
serious negotiations for releasing six us hostages simultaneously 
with the release of frozen iranian assets held in the united states 
since 1979 
the united states agreed to hand over assets worth at least 200 
million last month and sources close to a usiranian tribunal in 
the hague have said larger claims are nearing settlement 
among the americans held in lebanon is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he is the 
longest held of the hostages he was kidnapped march 16 1985

falling prices and mortgage rates combined 
with rising incomes in august to improve the typical american 
familys ability to buy a home a real estate trade group said 
monday 
but the national association of realtors said the improvement 
was curtailed by the persian gulf crisis and weakness in the 
overall economy 
the realtors said its housing affordability index rose from 
1024 in july to 1056 in august that meant a family with a median 
income of 34467 had 1056 percent of the income needed to buy a 
medianpriced existing home costing 97000 
the median means half of the families earn more and half earn 
less or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less 
declining interest rates in early august which brought 
borderline buyers into the market had the biggest positive impact 
on the index reading last month said realtors president norman 
d flynn however the decline was shortlived due to the middle 
east conflict and resulting united states military buildup in the 
persian gulf 
flynn said that while the problems with the economy were not 
rooted in the persian gulf crisis the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait has greatly increased the chances for a recession 
due to increasing oil prices we expect rates to increase 
during most of the fourth quarter pushing the housing 
affordability index down flynn said however we dont expect 
the index to go much below the 100 mark 
the interest rate used to calculate the index declined from 
1015 percent in july to 998 percent in august but has returned to 
doubledigits the rate is a composite of fixedrate and 
adjustablerate mortgages as reported by the federal housing 
finance board 
the median price for a house fell 1800 from 98300 in july 
while the median income rose 109 from 34358 the previous month 
the changes resulted in a 19 decrease to 680 in monthly 
mortgage payments including principal and interest 
the august median income exceeded the 32633 needed to qualify 
for a medianpriced home a family earning the median actually 
would qualify to buy a home priced at 102400 using conventional 
financing covering 80 percent of the cost 
under augusts affordability conditions a family earning 
20000 would have sufficient income to qualify for a 59500 home 
using a 47600 loan a family earning 30000 would qualify for an 
89300 home with a 71400 loan 
a family earning 40000 would have sufficient income to qualify 
for a 119000 home with a 95200 loan and a family with a 
50000 income would qualify for a 149000 home using a 119000 
loan

things may get a bit chaotic with about 
4000 people expected to be on hand but then the subject thats 
attracting everyone is chaos 
the growing field of mathmatics will be discussed at the the 
26th annual nobel conference at gustavus adolphus college 
at its basic chaos says that very simple mathematical formulas 
can produce very complex behavior it also says that some very 
complex and irregular action has underlying simplicity 
chaos seems to have application in such diverse fields as 
weather forecasting psychology and economics 
samuel patterson professor of mathematics at carleton college 
in northfield referred to chaos as the study of turbulence 
the twoday conference which starts tuesday has the official 
endorsement of the nobel foundation which presents the nobel 
prizes the foundation provides only its name not funding said 
school spokesman brett pyrtle 
each year a group at gustavus adolphus picks a topic invites 
experts to speak and the public to listen 
it has been practice to have at least one nobel prize winner at 
the conference this year it is ilya prigogine who received the 
prize for chemistry in 1977 and is author of several books on 
chaos 
among the speakers will be john polkinghorne an anglican priest 
and president of queens college at cambridge england who puts a 
theological twist on chaos he says chaos allows for free will and 
divine influence concepts at odds with newtonian mathematics that 
imply the universe runs like a clock 
the final speaker for the conference will be journalist james 
gleick whose 1987 book chaos making a new science won a 
national book award the book has sold 300000 copies in paperback 
david reese associate professor of economics at gustavus 
adolphus said he has been meeting for about a year with a group of 
people ranging from psychologists who think chaos might explain 
how people think to biologists who see chaos patterns in the 
bodys circulatory system 
chaos is tantalizing it can be a new tool to research systems 
including economic that dont repeat themselves but stay 
within certain boundaries reese said 
an example of implications of chaos is the butterfly effect 
in 1960 meteorologist edward lorenz discovered while testing a 
computer simulation of weather that very small differences at the 
outset resulted in very large differences at the end that means 
very longrange weather forecasting is impossible because 
forecasters could never know enough of the original conditions 
the name butterfly effect refers to the notion that the motion 
of a butterflys wings disturbing the air in beijing might lead to 
tornadoes in kansas

the norwegian nobel institute and the 
countrys news media are in the throes of a guessing game with 
traditions as strong as the peace prize itself 
the ritual is simple norways press tries to guess the name of 
the annual nobel laureate and the institute says nothing even 
though the decision was probably made several months ago 
we never say who the winner is before the official 
announcement said institute director geir lundestad there are 
100 nominations including 26 organizations for the 71st peace 
prize he said the winner will be announced oct 15 in oslo 
the other nobel prizes will be announced in stockholm starting 
with medicine on oct 8 the economics prize established in 1968 
and funded by the bank of sweden will be announced oct 16 
physics and chemistry prizes funded by income from the will of 
dynamiteinventor alfred bernard nobel will be announced oct 17 
the date for the literature prize has not been announced 
this years prizes are worth 695000 
there is an opportunity for one more meeting but most of the 
pieces have fallen into place lundestad said when asked if a 
1990 peace prize winner had been selected 
the media has picked four hot names soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev african national congress deputy president nelson 
mandela chinese prodemocracy student leader chai ling and 
czechoslovak president vaclev havel 
their brash predictions are sometimes off by a continent or two 
late last year newspapers were betting on eastern europes 
democratic reform leaders when the dalai lama the exiled spiritual 
leader of tibet had probably already been selected 
other recent winners were lech walesa leader of polands 
solidarity union south african anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
mother teresa and the united nations peace keeping forces 
lundestad said the great secrecy about the coveted prize first 
awarded in 1901 protects some candidates from reprisals or keeps 
their activities confidential 
names of candidates are never released no notes leave the room 
after deliberations by the fivemember nobel peace prize committee 
appointed by norways parliament for sixyear terms 
but nominations are often announced by those forwarding a 
candidate 
there are thousands of people and organizations with the right 
to nominate including former laureates elected officials even 
some university professors and organizations said lundestad who 
is not a voting member of the committee 
the picture becomes more clouded by scores of nominations from 
groups who have no right to make them norways largest labor 
union for example announced its enthusiastic but invalid 
nomination of gorbachev 
in that particular case the name was also forwarded in 
several other valid nominations lundestad said he confirmed the 
nomination because several groups have announced it 
the fiveemployee institute sifts through thousands of letters a 
year hunting for valid nominations that arrived before the feb 1 
deadline 
the us chamber of commerce this year pushed for the award in a 
secret campaign that appears to have started after a winner had 
already been selected 
it doesnt do any good anyway lundestad said about such 
campaigns 
the fiercely independent committee aided by institute 
researchers searches for a person or group fulfilling criteria set 
in nobels will 
there have been 19 years in which no prize was awarded

the gray doors of a prison swung open monday 
and karsten petermann strolled into the sunlight a free man in a 
free land for the first time in his life 
its a new chance petermann 21 said as he walked through 
the massive steel gate of east berlins highsecurity rummelsburg 
prison 
petermann was among the first convicts freed after the east 
german parliament in one of its last official acts before german 
unity on wednesday adopted a broad amnesty plan for people behind 
bars 
the program meant to make up for the harsh sentences handed 
down by the former communist regime trims prison sentences by a 
third for all inmates who were not convicted of violent crimes 
it was also a bit of a shock for inmates who were released not 
only into a newly democratic east germany but one that is two days 
from being absorbed by west germany 
sven heyse 20 served 13 months of a 20month sentence he said 
was handed down because he stoe 50 east german marks from his 
sisters boyfriend that cash was the equivalent of about 20 west 
german marks 12 under the former official exchange rate 
we lived in an oppressive land and we could never have 
expected this kind of amnesty from the communists under honecker 
and mielke he said referring to ousted communist party boss 
erich honecker and the chief of his secret police erich mielke 
heyse from the east german city of magdeburg said he plans to 
live in west berlin 
we wanted very much to be out here said sven bein 22 an 
east berliner who also was released from rummelsburg on monday 
petermann who said he was convicted of breaking into a house 
and given a severe sentence because of his political views said 
the amnesty is a great chance to start over 
im for unification said petermann who served 20 months of 
his sentence i never thought it would happen so fast 
heyse bein and petermann were among five youthful offenders 
freed monday from the 400inmate prison 
lawmakers feuded bitterly over the amnesty plan before adopting 
it late friday their last act before meeting for a final time 
tuesday to officially dissolve east germany 
the amnesty was meant to help people who were given unjustly 
harsh sentences by the former communist government which often 
used sentences for petty crimes to punish people who resisted the 
rigidly controlled social system 
naturally all of these people are very pleased said helmut 
raschdorff an official at rummelsburg prison 
he said he expects 115 inmates at the prison to fall under the 
amnesty program and hundreds of others nationwide each will be 
released after serving twothirds of his sentence 
the amnesty is the second since the communist government was 
ousted last autumn early this year scores of political prisoners 
were released 
the weeks of debate over the latest amnesty program coincided 
with uprisings at prisons across east germany inmates occupied 
prison rooftops and staged hunger strikes to demand amnesty 
the government of a united germany still has to deal with 
perhaps an even more senstive topic whether to grant amnesty to 
the spies and secret police agents from the former communist 
government

aeronautics and space administration in recent months is 
unwarranted

and industrious about getting the job done he said 
nonetheless lounge said he is as perplexed as anyone about the 
hydrogen leaks that have struck columbia as well as atlantis 
im really surprised were having this kind of problem in a 
mature system a system thats flown 35 times and for nine years 
he said 
no matter how bad things are it could be worse lounge said 
weve still got a mission were still going to fly it were 
still healthy well get it done and it will be worth it when we

former major leaguer jim bouton struck out 
monday with his pitch to the supreme court to revive a bigstakes 
contract battle over a baseball bubble gum product 
bouton lost an appeal to revive a 1 million damage award the 
justices without comment let stand a ruling that threw out the 
award against a subsidiary of the wrigley chewing gum company 
bouton a bestselling author and former pitching star was with 
a minor league team in portland ore in 1977 when he and coach 
rob nelson came up with the idea that led to big league chew 
shredded bubble gum in a pouch 
the idea was to devise a goodtasting substitute for chewing 
tobacco a macho symbol for many big leaguers 
the novelty was a bonanza that launched boutons business 
career sales were 18 million in 1981 after bouton and nelson 
teamed up with amurol products co of naperville ill a wrigley 
subsidiary to market the bubble gum 
bouton who lives in teaneck nj got into a dispute with 
amurol in 1984 over an advertising campaign for the gum that led 
to a mailgram the company sent to bouton agreeing to new contract 
terms 
a federal judge in new york city ruled that amurol violated the 
agreement and ordered it to pay bouton and his partner nearly 1 
million plus interest 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last may overturned

a highprofile american general furled the 
flag of his command monday and said there was close cooperation 
with soviet commanders who are also dropping some functions before 
reunification 
for the first time in 45 years germany will be a sovereign 
nation at midnight tuesday and there will be no room for soviet 
border checks within the former east germany or western allied 
military commandants with unusual lawmaking powers for west 
berlin 
the us commandant maj gen raymond e haddock formally 
deactivated his command at a ceremony attended by topranking 
diplomats and his two allied counterparts british maj gen robert 
js corbett and french maj gen francois cann 
the blackredandgold west german flag was flying for the first 
time beside the us flag over the cobblestone parade ground in 
front of the old nazi air force building that is the us command 
headquarters in west berlin 
honor platoons from the us army and air force stood at 
attention as haddock furled his command flag a redandwhite 
banner with the black berlin bear emblem and put it in an 
olivedrab cloth casing 
the twostar general who commanded the deployment of 
nucleartipped pershing ii missiles in west germany before he took 
the top us soldierdiplomat post in west berlin said allied 
determination to keep west berlin part of the democratic world had 
been tested repeatedly 
we in full cooperation with our french and british allies and 
our german partners have passed the test he said 
berlin and germany are being united in peace in freedom and 
upon a firm foundation of democratic values and the rule of law as 
a result the us command berlin is being inactivated 
he told a later news conference that soviet troops in east 
germany were ceasing to operate some border checkpoints 
the soviets had even invited western allied officers to join 
closingdown celebrations such as at the glienecke bridge the 
famed spyexchange crossing point between west berlin and potsdam 
in east germany he said 
they are joining with us to return normality to what will be a 
sovereign nation in a few hours haddock said its a matter of 
close cooperation and working together 
but no soviets attended haddocks deactivation ceremony nor did 
military representatives from west germany haddock said west 
german military officials had been invited to attend but declined 
because the present status of west berlin forbids a german military 
presence in the city 
i respect that decision but i want it made absolutely clear 
that an invitation was extended he said noting that a retired 
top west german general attended the ceremony 
forbidding a german military role in berlin was a key element of 
the postwar allied policy of demilitarizing germany 
the deactivation of the american british and french commandant 
functions in west berlin will be marked at a ceremony tuesday in 
which generals of the three countries hand their powers over to 
german officials opening the way for a german military presence in 
the city 
the soviets and the three western allies will continue to base 
troops in germany after the two germanys unify 
the soviets have agreed to withdraw their troops by the end of 
1994 
the western allies are talking about troop reductions in what is 
now west germany and are expected to pull their forces out of west 
berlin as the soviets leave east germany 
haddock said the present us strength of about 6000 troops in 
west berlin will be cut in the coming year by about 700 as a sign 
that we are ready to reduce our force in berlin 
and as the soviets are ending border checkpoints so are the 
allies he said but he refused to liken the western presence in 
germany to that of the soviets 
we have been asked to stay here they have been asked to 
leave he said 
haddocks post as commandant held an unusual combination of 
military and diplomatic duties reflecting the fact that berlin has 
been in legal terms an occupied city since 1945 laws passed by 
the west german parliament have to be signed by the three allied 
commandants before taking effect in west berlin 
that power fades into history at midnight tuesday

president bush today denounced iraqi 
president saddam hussein as an international outcast who plundered 
kuwait but bush also offered baghdad hope that relinquishing its 
grip on its persian gulf neighbor could spur negotiations on the 
arabisraeli conflict 
the presidents speech to the un general assembly blended 
condemnation of saddam with an overture for a resolution of the 
twomonth crisis we seek a peaceful outcome a diplomatic 
outcome bush said 
significantly he offered the iraqi leader the prospect of new 
arrangements among the states in the gulf region as well as a 
chance for a settlement between the arabs and israel provided 
iraq leaves kuwait unconditionally 
iraqs unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era a 
dark relic from a dark time bush said it has plundered 
kuwait terrorized innocent civilians and held even diplomats 
hostage 
the president lining up with a proposal first advanced last 
week by soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said iraq 
and its leadership must be held liable for these crimes of abuse 
and destruction 
but at the same time bush edged perceptibly closer to saddams 
demand that his territorial dispute with kuwait be linked to the 
arabs grievance with israel for holding on to territory syria and 
jordan lost in the 1967 mideast war 
shevardnadze said afterward that bush had delivered a 
brilliant speech 
a similar gesture last week by president francois mitterrand of 
france drew a mixed response sunday from saddam who suggested that 
iraq would fight to defend its seizure of kuwait but also offered 
to open a debate with france on the regions future 
we intend to make contacts with the french government to 
explain after inquiry questioning and dialogue our views 
accurately so that everything is based on clear ideas and 
actions the iraqi leader said in a broadcast message on the 
birthday of the muslim prophet mohammed 
mitterrand in a fourstep proposal called first for iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait which it invaded on aug 2 the pullout 
would be supervised by international observers as the emirates 
sovereignty was restored 
then negotiators would deal with the division of lebanon and 
the arabisrael conflict in the fourth stage armaments in the 
middle east and the persian gulf would be scaled down 
bush reiterated that iraqs annexation of kuwait will not be 
permitted to stand and that saddam has placed his country against 
the world 
however the president said in the aftermath of iraqs 
unconditional departure from kuwait i truly believe that there may 
be opportunities 
for iraq and kuwait to settle their differences permanently 
for the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for 
stability and for all the states and peoples of the region to 
settle the conflict that divides the arabs from israel 
and yet bush said the worlds key task now first and 
always must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be 
tolerated or rewarded 
the speech seemed to reflect a us policy shift throughout the 
gulf crisis us officials insisted that iraqs seizure of kuwait 
could not be linked in any way to the arabisraeli dispute or other 
regional problems 
the united states has long been committed to a mideast 
settlement in which israel would exchange territory for arab 
recognition of its right to exist bush made no reference on how 
the talks would be held the soviets and the arabs demand a mideast 
peace conference but the israeli government objects 
in an exchange with reporters later bush said his position had 
not changed 
there is no flexibility here he said 
asked then if his speech reflected a shift in emphasis bush 
replied you are reading too much into this there is no nuance 
to be read into the remarks 
on the question of whether the un should vote to authorize the 
use of force against iraq bush said we have not been pressing 
for that at this point 
bush said that some experts now believe that this man 
hussein if you look at his record will do a 180 you look at 
his history with iran and hes done a 180degree turn and done 
exactly what he said he wouldnt do 
bush assured saddam that we seek no advantages for ourselves 
in the gulf 
nor he said do we seek to maintain our military forces in 
saudi arabia for one day longer than is necessary 
bush said the 165000 us troops defending the oilfields of 
saudi arabia were sent there at the request of the saudi government 
following iraqs aug 2 invastion of kuwait 
the american people and this president want every single 
american soldier brought home as soon as the mission is 
accomplished he said 
bush praised the soviet union for collaborating with the united 
states in a worldwide cutoff of trade with iraq the superpowers 
had indeed put four decades of history behind us he said 
more than ever before bush said the united nations is now a 
center for international collective security 
the passage hinted that the united states and soviet union would 
seek security council approval for military action against iraq if 
saddam does not withdraw his troops from kuwait 
us officials said sunday the two superpowers as well as a 
number of other countries had begun preliminary drafting of 
resolutions to authorize the use of force 
praising the uns resolve bush said this challenge is a 
test we cannot afford to fail i am confident we will prevail 
the gulf crisis and the proliferation of nuclear chemical and 
biological weapons along with the ballistic missiles that can 
rain destruction upon distant peoples contrasted with the rosy 
picture of a world emerging from cold war tensions 
weve seen a century sundered by barbed threats and barbed 
wire give way to a new era of peace cooperation and freedom the 
president said 
behind the scenes meanwhile the united states the soviet 
union and a number of other nations have begun drafting resolutions 
to take action against iraq if the squeeze does not force iraq to 
release its hold on kuwait us officials said sunday 
everybody is looking at options thinking what can we do 
next said a us official who described the soviet unions 
approach to saddam as potentially tougher than the stance taken by 
the bush administration 
the drafting has not reached the point where bush is ready to 
make an announcement the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity described it as back of the envelope work at this 
point

the us supreme courts rejection monday of an 
appeal by three white defendants in the howard beach racial death 
case closes off only one avenue of appeal a defense attorney says 
there are some new trial issues which we will be exploring 
said lawyer charles weintraub 
the court made no comment when it let stand the manslaughter and 
assault convictions of jon lester scott kern and jason ladone 
weintraub had argued they were wrongly limited in excluding blacks 
as trial jurors 
new yorks highest court rejected the argument last march 
the issues were significant but obviously the court is not 
prepared to address those issues at this time weintraub said 
there are some other issues that will be addressed in new trial 
motions 
he refused to discuss what the new issues would be 
on dec 19 1986 a car carrying four black men broke down in 
the predominantly white howard beach section of the borough of 
queens 
three of the men michael griffith cedric sandiford and 
timothy grimes left the car to seek assistance 
the three were attacked by a gang of white teenagers including 
lester kern and ladone according to trial testimony 
the youths chased griffith onto a highway where he was struck 
and killed by a car sandiford was beaten with a baseball bat and 
tree limbs 
the case galvanized black activists in new york in the weeks 
that followed police reported a sharp increase in racial violence 
in the city several fights between blacks and whites were 
punctuated by cries of howard beach howard beach 
during the 1987 trial of lester kern and ladone prosecutors 
complained that the defense lawyers were using their peremptory or 
automatic challenges of potential jurors to exclude all blacks 
in response to the prosecutors complaints the trial judge 
justice thomas demakos barred the defendants lawyers from using 
their automatic challenges to exclude potential jurors because of 
their race 
defense lawyers argued unsuccessfully that prosecutors were 
using their automatic challenges to keep whites off the jury 
the states highest court upheld the three mens convictions 
after ruling that defendants lawyers in all criminal cases may be 
barred from excluding potential jurors because of their race 
the us supreme court in 1986 barred prosecutors from doing 
that ruling that such exclusions are unconstitutional but the 
justices never have said the us constitution imposes such a 
prohibition on defense lawyers 
the state courts ruling appeared to rely solely on the new york 
constitution 
lawyers for lester kern and ladone said the state court ruling 
was an unwarranted expansion of the supreme courts 1986 decision 
the appeal said the new york constitution as interpreted by the 
state court should be declared a violation of the us 
constitutions protections for criminal defendants fairtrial 
rights 
lester was sentenced to up to 30 years in prison kern to up to 
18 years and ladone to up to 15 years weintraub said all have 
begun serving time

the suprem court opening its 199091 term 
one justice short agreed monday to decide whether juries may 
impose stiffer sentences because of a crimes impact on the victims 
or their families 
the court said it will use a case from ohio to consider 
reversing recent rulings banning such victimimpact evidence 
the case was among some 1000 acted upon by the eight justices 
as they returned from a threemonth summer recess they rejected 
appeals in the vast majority agreeing to hear and decide just 25 
david h souter president bushs first nominee to the high 
court is expected to fill the vacancy created by the july 
retirement of justice william j brennan the senate is expected to 
confirm souter on tuesday making him the 105th justice in the 
courts history 
the court in this term plans to hear arguments in key cases 
involving abortion counseling fetal protection school 
desegregation and the war on drug the justices previously granted 
review of appeals in those cases 
for the first time in 34 years brennan was not on the bench as 
the court convened for a new term he walked into the courtroom 
using a cane and sat in a section reserved for special guests as 
his former colleagues paid tribute to him 
chief justice william h rehnquist praised brennan for his 
personal warmth and wise counsel as he read an exchange of letters 
between brennan and the other justices brennan 84 the courts

asked the bush administration for its views on the power of 
employers to bar workers from joining or serving in the military 
reserves the court is being asked to revive the baltimore police 
departments policy of limiting the number of employees allowed to 
be in active reserve units 
in the victimimpact case the court said it will consider 
reinstating the death penalty for ediberto huertas in a 
lovetriangle murder 
huertas fatally stabbed ralph harris jr in lorain ohio on 
june 7 1986 he now is serving a life sentence for the crime 
on leave from the air force harris was spending the night with 
elba ortiz huertas who had fathered two children with ms ortiz 
allegedly warned harris he would waste him if he continued to 
see the woman 
a state jury imposed the death sentence after hearing evidence 
that harris parents wanted huertas to die for his crime elizabeth 
harris the victims mother also testified emotionally that she 
was proud of her churchgoing son and that his death had devastated 
the victims young son 
the supreme court in 1987 ruled that such victimimpact evidence 
should not be considered by sentencing juries 
and last year the justices voted 54 with brennan writing for 
the court that a jury generally may not be told about the 
victims character the court said a south carolina murderer 
unfairly was sentenced to die because the jury heard such 
testimony 
the four justices who dissented from last years decision said 
then they were ready to overturn the 1987 ruling and permit 
victimimpact testimony in criminal sentencing 
the ohio supreme court relied on both us supreme court rulings 
when it reduced huertas death sentence to life in prison last may 
prosecutors argued that the jury should have been allowed to 
consider the impact of harris murder on his family because huertas 
and harris had been high school friends and huertas knew the 
family the killer was aware of the impact his crime would have on 
the family they said 
but the ohio supreme court said such evidence is relevant to the 
sentence only when the evidence has a connection to the 
defendants personal responsibility and moral guilt 
otherwise the state court said such testimony undermines the 
defendants right to be sentenced by an impartial jury

american and british relatives watched 
a video recording monday of the last radar blips of pan am flight 
103 in which their loved ones were killed by a terrorist bomb 
it was like watching them being killed one said 
the start of the first public inquiry concentrated on events of 
dec 21 1988 when the boeing 747 exploded over the nearby town of 
lockerbie claiming 270 lives 
as family members watched video screens in the courtroom air 
traffic controller alan topp traced the final moments of the square 
blips on a green radar screen that indicated flight 103 until the 
moment the plane exploded 
a square blip with a cross from radar on the planes flight 
deck vanished immediately leaving an empty square designating 
ground radar readings 
this single square gradually multiplied as the radar picked up 
separate pieces of the disintegrating aircraft falling to earth 
31000 feet below 
topp 54 who was at the prestwick scotland air traffic 
control center described frantic efforts to contact the plane 
i came to the conclusion the clipper was lost when i didnt 
get through and saw this mess on the screen he said 
light debris from the aircraft showed as blips on the radar 
screen drifting across the north of england and southern scotland 
for the next 20 to 30 minutes topp said 
the fuelladen wing section and part of the fuselage crashed in 
lockerbie less than a minute after the explosion with a force 
equivalent to an earthquake of 13 on the richter scale said 
terence turbitt a geophysicist with the british geological survey 
the replay was horrible said dr jim swire who heads the 
group of british relatives before it exploded i could see in my 
mind the inside of the cabin and its bright lights warmth and 
companionship 
from the moment the bomb went off all hell must have broken 
loose we know the plane turned on its left side and went into a 
vertical dive what we dont know is how long they survived thats 
whats worrying us he said 
can you imagine going from warmth and bright lights to a gale 
with 400knot winds which would blow your clothes off thats 
why most of the bodies had no clothes said swire whose 
24yearold daughter flora was on the plane 
george williams of joppatowne md whose only son geordie a 
24yearold army lieutenant died in the crash said a lump came to 
his throat 
to see the actual moment when my son lost his life was 
tough he said 
for pamela dix of dublin whose brother peter 35 died it 
was like watching them being killed 
this is just the start theres worse to come said jean 
flick of coventry whose son clayton and his fiance were on the 
plane 
like all the relatives mrs flick said she wants the fatal 
accident inquiry to reveal the truth about the crash 
and those that havent done their jobs right must be made 
accountable she said 
williams was tougher 
i want people from pan am jailed people from the government 
censured and fired that were involved in the coverup and i want 
the criminals executed he said 
the inquiry will examine airport security but will not take 
evidence on the question of criminal responsibility for the 
bombing 
capt robert l gould pan american world airways senior vice 
president for operations who attended the opening issued a 
statement saying the airline also wants the truth 
he said pan am wants airlines protected from terrorist attacks 
but airports have not been built to meet todays sophisticated 
terrorist threats and risks

indias supreme court ordered the 
government on monday to halt its controversial job quota program 
and appealed for an end to protests against the policy that have 
killed dozens of people 
we hope that the law and order situation will immediately 
improve chief justice ranganath mishra said after issuing the 
ruling 
the courts temporary injunction remains in effect until the 
panel rules on the legality of the quotas press trust of india 
said the court could begin to hear arguments on the affirmative 
action program as early as oct 25 
at least 70 people have died in a rash of riots and student 
suicides since prime minister vp singh announced aug 7 that 
almost half of all government jobs would be reserved for 
lowercaste hindus 
public opposition to the governmen has been widespread in the 
politically influential cities of northern india the army has been 
called out and curfews clamped on several towns to control rioting 
students joined sometimes by middleaged housewives and government 
employees 
two members of singhs governing party have resigned from 
parliament and some colleagues demanded his ouster because of the 
quotas singh has refused to abandon the policy saying it is an 
affirmative action program that would give social justice to the 
lower castes 
critics say he fears alienating the lower castes which form a 
majority of the eligible votes among indias 880 million people 
uppercaste students say reverse discrimination will deprive 
them of government jobs for which they are better qualified 
on monday the decision was taken out of singhs hands 
the supreme court said the government should take no action on 
the policys implementation until its legality is determined 
until the matter is heard and we expect it to be finished 
before the end of the year no further steps should be taken 
mishra said 
the court however allowed the government to continue 
assembling a list of the thousands of castes that will qualify for 
the job quotas 
the plan reserves 27 percent of federal jobs for lowcaste 
hindus an additional 22 percent already are set aside for the 
lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy of indian society 
tribespeople and the socalled untouchables 
in parliament the government faced a separate problem monday 
when it failed to pass a constitutional amendment extending federal 
rule in the northern state of punjab where sikh militants are 
fighting for independence 
the state govenment in punjab was dismissed in 1987 and replaced 
by federal rule which the constitution limits to three years 
amending the document requires a twothirds majority 
in a surprise move aimed at embarassing the government the 
opposition congress party refused to support the bill leaders of 
all the parties were summoned to the speakers chambers to find a 
way out of the impasse 
singh 10monthold government suffered another setback when the 
speaker of the legislature agreed to hold a debate on a motion 
seeking to censure the government for mishandling the student 
protest 
the motion if passed would put pressure on the government to 
quit said kewal verma a parliamentary analyst 
there is no legal obligation on the part of the government to 
resign but it would amount to its defeat in moral terms verma 
said 
in the parliament congress party members accused singh of being 
obstinate for refusing to suspend or reconsider the affirmative 
action plan down down resign resign they shouted as singh 
stood up to speak he was prevented from addressing the house 
cant you see there is blood in your hands said congress 
lawmaker ajit panja some members advanced menacingly at singh but 
were stopped by colleagues you are a bloodstained politician 
panja said 
former congress minister vasant sathe said he was beginning a 
fast unto death until singh stops police terror on the 
students 
in the northern town of jammu 17yearold student sandeep 
sharma set himself on fire monday in the latest suicide bid to

a southern baptist seminary in new orleans 
being forced to grant a divinity degree to a man it says is unfit 
for christian ministry lost a supreme court appeal monday 
the court left standing louisiana rulings that force the 
seminary to grant the degree as it rejected arguments that the new 
orleans baptist theological seminarys religious freedom is being 
trampled 
the dispute centered on rudolph babcocks attempt to receive a 
master of divinity degree in marriage and family counseling 
seminary officials said babcock was unfit because of continued 
physical and verbal abuse of his wife 
a state appeals court ruled that it was not bound by numerous 
past decisions keeping courts out of ecclesiastical or 
churchgoverning disputes 
this is not an ecclesiastical matter the state court 
this case involves an institution which although perhaps having 
characteristics of a church necessarily functions as a school 
lawyers for the seminary after being denied help by the 
louisiana supreme court sought help from the nations highest 
court 
to permit such an action to stand would inextricably entangle 
the government in the affairs of the church and have dire 
consequences for every religious body in america the seminarys 
appeal said 
in a supporting brief the baptist joint committee on public 
affairs the christian legal society and the national council of 
churches called the louisiana appeals court ruling as astonishing 
as it is unprecedented

the supreme court said monday it will consider 
letting states outlaw all barroomstyle nude dancing the justices 
voted to hear an effort to reinstate such a law from indiana 
the court will review a ruling that nonobscene nude dancing 
performed as entertainment is expression and as such is entitled to 
limited protection under the constitutions first amendment 
in striking down the use of indianas public indecency law to 
prosecute nude dancing the 7th us circuit court of appeals last 
may relied heavily on a 1981 supreme court ruling 
in it the justices said nude dancing is not without its 
first amendment protections from official regulations the 1981 
decision did not specify the precise scope of those protections 
the appeals courts ruling in may reached by a 74 vote said 
while clearly not all conduct is expression dance as 
entertainment is a form of conduct that is inherently expressive 
the indiana law was challenged by two south bend businesses a 
bar and an adult bookstore that features live dancers and three 
women who say they want to dance without having to wear pasties and 
gstrings 
indianas appeal was supported in friendofthecourt briefs 
submitted by arizona connecticut missouri north carolina and 
pennsylvania and by the american family association previously 
known as the national federation for decency

these are house niggers these are uncle toms these are 
black prostitutes who are still being bought by white politicians 
selling out their people mitchell said during a radio program

22 but one day after mitchells comments campbell pulled out of 
the debate 
im not about to give him a forum for his vitriolic diatribe

eight state attorneys general on monday 
complained to president bush about a republican fundraising scheme 
they compared to mailorder frauds and telemarketing scams 
in a letter to bush the attorneys general objected to a program 
under which the republican presidential task force mailed 25 
checks to more than a million potential campaign contributors 
the task force asks recipients to deposit the checks in their 
checking accounts to test a new republican fundraising procedure 
cashing the checks authorizes the gop to deduct 1250 a month from 
the recipients checking accounts indefinitely unless consumers 
take steps to halt the payments 
this solicitation marks a shameful low in the history of 
american campaigning the attorneys general wrote to bush it 
reduces the political process to the level of integrity normally 
associated with flybynight con artists mail frauds and 
telemarketing scams 
besides abrams the attorneys general of minnesota oregon 
alabama north dakota connecticut michigan and illinois signed 
the letter attorneys general don siegelman of alabama and neil 
hartigan of illinois have filed lawsuits against the task force

the oregon supreme court has restored five 
initiative measures to the nov 6 ballot reversing a lower court 
ruling that had disqualified them on a technicality 
in a secondary ruling the supreme court upheld lower court 
decisions that had struck financial impact statements from three 
measures on grounds officials missed a deadline for approving them 
state law requires that financial estimates be printed on 
ballots and in the state voters pamphlet for measures having a 
substantial impact on the state treasury 
two marion county judges ruled that fiscal statements for three 
measures were invalid because state officials approved them after a 
legal deadline election officials had removed fiscal statements 
from five other measures because they were handled under the same 
procedures 
the result was that as many as eight of the 11 statewide 
measures on the general election ballot were in jeopardy because of 
the legal tangle 
elections officials have said the financial effects statements 
might be posted in voting booths as a substitute for having them on 
the ballot or in the voters pamphlet 
the supreme court announced its unanimous decision friday after 
hearing oral arguments and had no further comment saying written 
opinions would be issued later

sinai medical center in cleveland where she had the operation in

103000 to pay for jaysons upbringing until age 18 ms harmath 
20 and single when she became pregnant said having the child 
created a heavy financial burden

the supreme court on monday asked the bush 
administration whether employers should be able to limit the number 
of workers who join or serve in te military reserves 
the court said it wants to hear what justice department lawyers 
think about a ruling that struck down the baltimore police 
departments policy of limiting the number of employees allowed to 
be in active reserve units 
after hearing from the government lawyers which could take 
months the court will decide whether to review the baltimore 
dispute 
although the courts action comes at a time when president bush 
has ordered tens of thousands of reservists to active duty in the 
wake of iraqs invasion of kuwait in august the baltimore dispute 
dates back to 1986 
at issue is whether a federal law the veterans reemployment 
rights act gives employees an absolute right to join the reserves 
and an absolute entitlement to a leave of absence to fulfill 
reserve training obligations 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last march ruled in the 
baltimore case that employers never may interfere with a workers 
joining or serving in the reserves 
other federal courts however have said employers need not 
honor an employees request for a leave to serve in the reserves if 
the request is not reasonable 
lawyers for the baltimore police department urged the justices 
to resolve the conflicting rulings

the governments main national newspaper 
izvestia has missed publication the last two sundays because of a 
newsprint shortage indicating the severity of the breakdown of 
supplies to state enterprises 
the governments flagship newspaper a daily with a circulation 
of 101 million did not come out on sept 23 and sept 30 the 
first such break since it began publishing seven days a week 10 
years ago managing editor vasily zakharo said monday 
the paper explained the breaks in publication saturday in a 
fourparagraph column headlined for the enlightenment of 
readers saying it hoped the breaks in publication would be the 
last 
president mikhail s gorbachev using his newly granted 
emergency powers issued a decree last week ordering all companies 
to fulfill their supply contracts with state enterprises 
ostensibly including newsprint but it was unclear how effectively 
the order could be enforced 
supplies of many products ranging from food to newsprint and 
other materials have been increasingly hard to find as some 
factories refuse to honor contracts with enterprises in other 
republics or workers siphon off supplies for private sale 
zakharo also said monday the newspapers editorial board has 
decided to cut back to six days a week on jan 1 1991 to meet a 
demand by mail carriers for a day off on sunday he insisted the 
decision was unrelated to the paper shortage but added the size of 
the paper would not increase to make up for the lost day 
soviet mail service is miminal on sundays with the national 
newspapers izvestia and pravda accounting for much of the delivery 
work

chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will tour military bases in 
five states before returning to the pentagon on friday for a news 
conference 
the soviet general who has been quoted as saying he is helping 
the united states with data on soviet weapons given iraq went 
first to powells office for photographs 
weve left a very good picture for the history books the 
soviet general said as the flash units flared 
powell escorted moiseyev to the office of defense secretary dick 
cheney for a visit then led him to the meeting room used by the 
military chiefs for private talks 
following a private lunch he helped lay a wreath at the tomb of 
the unknowns at arlington national cemetery before beginning talks 
on capitol hill with congressional leaders 
over the week moiseyev 51 will visit army air force navy and 
marine corps units in new york michigan south dakota california

highest ranking soviet military officer to visit the united states

the federal reserve will move quickly to lower 
interest rates now that negotiators have reached agreement on a 
deficitcutting plan many economists predicted monday 
but these analysts said the interest rate relief will be too 
little and too late to avert a recession 
this forecast was made on the eve of a key meeting tuesday of 
the feds top policymaking group the federal open market 
committee the panel composed of fed board members in washington 
and fed regional bank presidents meets eight times a year to set 
interest rate policies 
president bush told reporters monday that he was looking for the 
fed to lower interest rates once they see that a sound budget 
agreement has been put into effect bush and congressional 
leaders have pledged to try to write the agreement into legislation 
and enact it by oct 19 
many economists expected a vote at tuesdays meeting to nudge 
shortterm interest rates down by about onefourth of a percentage 
point the actual rate cut they said might come as early as next 
week 
some economists said the rate cut would be enough to prompt 
commercial banks to lower their benchmark prime lending rate from 
10 percent to 95 percent although there wasnt universal 
agreement on this forecast 
analysts who expect a fairly prompt fed easing move noted 
numerous statements federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has 
made that the central bank stood ready to lower interest rates 
following a credible multiyear deficit reduction package 
greenspan has got to ease if he doesnt he is telling the 
financial markets that he doesnt view the deficit agreement as 
credible said david wyss chief financial economist with 
drimcgraw hill 
wyss said that if congress showed evidence of moving quickly to 
approve the budget agreement and the september unemployment report 
due out on friday showed a further rise in the jobless rate then 
the fed would move perhaps as early as next week to cut the federal 
funds rate from 8 percent to 775 percent 
the fed funds rate the interest that banks charge each other 
for overnight loans is the bellwether rate the fed often uses to 
signal changes in its credit policies 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said while he 
was looking for a quick rate cut on the feds part markets should 
not expect anything beyond a quarter of a percentage point drop 
given the inflationary pressures arising from a doubling of oil 
prices since august when iraq invaded neighboring kuwait 
the fed is being tossed back and forth by the iraqi event 
sinai said it wants to ease because of an impending recession 
but aggressive easing is very hard to do as long as the inflation 
threat is as great as it is 
david jones an economist at aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer in new york said regardless of 
whether the fed eases immediately or waits until congress actually 
passes the budget agreement the rate cut will not be in time to 
keep alive the current recovery which has already lasted a 
peacetime record of eight years 
the handwriting is on the wall jones said the fed has 
already waited too long if it had hoped to avoid a recession 
jones and many other analysts believe the first economic 
downturn since the 198182 slump will begin sometime in the final 
three months of this year 
while a number of analysts forecast a fed easing move to support 
a budget deal this forecast was not universally shared 
jerry jordan chief economist of the first interstate bancorp of 
los angeles said it would be a mistake for the fed to rush to 
support the budget deal with lower interest rates 
jordan one of a group of economists who monitor fed actions as 
part of the shadow open market committee warned that fed efforts 
to ease rates ran the risk of allowing the higher inflation from 
this years oil shocks to become embedded in the economy 
many analysts who believe the fed will begin to ease rates in 
coming months said they looked for those rate cuts to accelerate 
early next year once it becomes clear the country is in a 
recession 
jones said the fed will be forced next year to keep pushing 
rates down because the banking system which already faces heavy 
losses from collapsing real estate markets will move slower than 
it has in the past to lower the cost of loans to businesses and 
consumers in response to fed easing moves

fundamental freedoms set down in the 1975 helsinki agreement 
produced by the european security conference 
depending on the decisions taken by the foreign ministers the 
paris summit is expected to establish a new structure to bridge 
east and west and also a treaty to cut us and soviet weapons in 
europe 
bush after a meeting with shevardnadze said the soviet 
minister was confident the accord would be ready for signing in 
paris 
i came out of the meeting encouraged also in asking for 
flexibility so these negotiators can polish off the remaining 
differences bush said 
baker and shevardnadze made headway in two meetings last week 
and will meet here again wednesday 
meanwhile the administration gave its support to full 
membership for the three baltic republics and said albania may be

two descendants of a founder of procter amp 
gamble co said monday they want stop the giant company from buying 
coffee grown in el salvador in an effort to end that countrys 
civil war 
the coffee growers benefit from the war james gamble said 
at a news conference here it produces a very cheap labor 
force that cannot organize because of the civil strife 
but james gamble and his brother robert admit they have little 
chance of winning their proxy fight at the companys stockholder 
oct 9 meeting in cincinnati 
it was an accomplishment for us to get the resolution 
officially on the ballot james gamble said we dont have an 
illusion of actually winning the vote but if were able to win 3 
percent this year then the resolution stays on the ballot for next 
year 
salvadoran beans make up about 2 percent of the coffee used to 
produce procter amp gambles folgers coffee 
we could very easily replace the salvadoran coffee with coffee 
beans from other countries but this isnt an economic decision for 
us said company spokesman donald tassone 
as a company we cant let a very small but vocal group inject 
us into their dispute with the us government no matter how 
wellintentioned it might be he said 
the white house has asked procter amp gamble to continue buying 
the beans because of the importance of coffee sales to the 
salvadoran economy 
white house chief of staff john sununu called a 10monthold 
consumer boycott of some coffee that uses salvadoran beans 
including folgers a misguided attempt to cripple the salvadoran 
economy that will do nothing to advance the peace process 
democracy or human rights 
procter amp gamble calls the conflict a dispute between peace 
activists and us foreign policy and would prefer not to get 
involved 
in a position paper distributed to shareholders the company 
noted that el salvadors roman catholic bishops oppose the coffee 
boycott because lost sales would hurt farmers and workers 
james gamble said salvadoran landowners would be likely to 
pressure their government to negotiate for peace if their sales to 
a major client were on the line 
the corporation he said could play a very critical role in 
speeding up the negotiation process 
there is a total of 346425304 voting shares in procter amp 
gamble james gamble 27 owns 24806 shares worth about 2 
million robert gamble 30 said he wasnt sure how many shares he 
controls 
both brothers said they had the support of their father and 
other family members 
they wouldnt say how much stock owned by other family members 
would be voting their way next week but conceded it would be less 
than 1 percent of the total

blocked in sections of croatia on monday after minority serbs 
proclaimed autonomy in the region and staged antigovernment 
rallies 
the serbian people must use all means to resist the terror of 
the fascist croatian government and to protect its human dignity 
and civil and national rights the serbian national council said 
in a statement carried by the tanjug news agency 
the council an unofficial body claiming to represent the 
estimated 500000 serbs in croatia said the declaration was based 
on an august referendum that showed nearunanimous support for 
limited selfgovernment croatian authorities declared the 
referendum illegal 
yugoslav leaders plan to meet tuesday to discuss the conflict in 
croatia a northern state of about 5 million people belgrade 
television reported 
belgrade radio reported barricades were set up early monday 
across roads and railway lines to knin a serbiandominated city of 
about 10000 people near the adriatic coast the blockades sealed 
off traffic through much of western croatia 
tension between serbs and croats dating to the birth of 
yugoslavia in 1918 intensified earlier this year following the 
first free elections in croatia since 1945 the serbs accuse the 
newly elected authorities of discrimination 
croatian leaders claim the unrest has been orchestrated by the 
communistruled republic of serbia to destabilize democracy in 
croatia and gain support for its hardline policies 
in belgrade more than 1000 serbs rallied monday night a few 
thousand serbs also gathered in banski grabovac a village 
southeast of zagreb around a flameshaped monument honoring the 
mainly serbian partisans who fought the croatianled goverment 
established by nazis during world war ii 
borisav mikelic head of a faction of the croatian socialist 
party said serbs cannot promise to halt attacks until authorities 
stop revanchist detentions and arrests 
last week serbs raided police armories in several towns and 
seized automatic weapons 
hundreds of serbs have reportedly taken refuge in an army 
barracks in petrinja about 25 miles south of the croatiaa capital 
of zagreb to escape riot police seeking to recover weapons at

temple university on monday renewed its 
request for a court order ending a 27day walkout by professors 
claiming it will have to cancel fall semester classes unless they 
are back on the job by tuesday 
the 1100member union went on strike over pay sept 4 at the 
private university which has 30000 students union members sunday 
night rejected the latest contract proposal by 37262 
temple and union attorneys argued in court over whether the 
professors should be ordered back temple officials have said if 
pickets are still marching tuesday they will cancel 40 percent or 
1900 of the 4700 classes 
common pleas court judge samuel lehrer said his response will 
hinge in part on determining how serious a threat the strike poses 
to the public 
if it doesnt matter whether temple goes out of business or 
cancels classes then there is no public danger lehrer said 
but if it does matter and if there is a threat to the public 
then i must consider that 
lehrer denied a union request that he throw out the universitys 
request for a backtowork order the hearing continued late in the 
afternoon 
alaine williams attorney for the temple association of 
university professionals said the university was trying to force 
the judges hand by threatening to cancel classes 
but the judge replied i think they have made a case and your 
motion is denied 
temple officials have said that if the strike continues there 
will not be enough time to make up lost class time before the 
spring semester some 23000 students are missing at least one 
class and 6000 have had no classes because of the walkout 
witnesses for the union argued that even if the strike 
continued professors would be able to make up for lost class time 
by extending the semester or scheduling extra class hours 
it would be difficult but we can work it out successfully 
said violet kettles of the english faculty 
the proposal rejected sunday included 5 percent raises in each 
of four years and a requirement that professors contribute 260 a 
year toward health coverage 
the professors whose salaries average about 45500 want 7 
percent raises and do not want to pay for health care 
some students have blocked city streets and stood outside a 
courtroom demanding an end to the dispute some have been arrested 
for invading university president peter j liacouras office 
were very upset we just want it over nobody is interested 
in the students anymore were like pawns said rachel smith a 
19yearold sophomore from margate nj if i transfer im not 
coming back

president bush said monday that iraq and 
its leaders must be held liable for crimes of abuse and 
destruction in the takeover of kuwait but he also suggested to 
baghdad that an unconditional military withdrawal could help speed 
an end to the arabisraeli conflict 
bush in a speech before the un general assembly said all 
nations hope that military force will not be required to drive iraq 
from kuwait yet he won applause by vowing anew that iraqs 
annexation of kuwait will not be allowed to stand 
praising the uns resolve bush said this challenge is a 
test we cannot afford to fail i am confident we will prevail 
even as bush was speaking the white house announced the united 
states was sending two batteries of patriot airdefense missiles to 
israel on an emergency basis 
the weapons will help israel defend against an increased threat 
from ballistic missiles in iraq presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
nearly every seat in the general assembly hall was full as bush 
combined a blistering indictment of iraq with an overture for 
baghdad to end the twomonth old persian gulf crisis 
iraqs unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era a 
dark relic from a dark time bush said it has plundered 
kuwait it has terrorized innocent civilians it has held even 
diplomats hostage 
aligning himself with remarks last week by soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze bush said iraq and its leaders must 
be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction 
bush met separately with shevardnadze later to discuss the gulf 
crisis the plight of the soviet economy and lagging arms control 
talks emerging from the meeting bush said shevardnadze was very 
confident that a treaty between nato and the warsaw pact to cut 
us and soviet nonnuclear weapons would be ready for signing at a 
35nation summit in paris 
bush said he was not as confident about completing a separate 
accord with the soviets to cut longrange nuclear missiles bombers 
and submarines by 30 percent bush had hoped to sign that treaty 
during a trip to moscow in december but said shevardnadze talked 
about completing the agreement early next year if not by the end 
of 1990 
shevardnadze praised bushs speech as brilliant 
aside from his hardedged rhetoric bush appeared to try to 
undercut iraqi president saddam husseins demand that his 
territorial dispute with kuwait be linked to arab demands that 
israel give up territory lost by syria and jordan in the 1967 
mideast war 
bush said that i truly believe there may be opportunities to 
settle the arabisraeli conflict and to build new arrangements 
among the states in the gulf but only after iraq makes an 
unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
saddam has suggested he would pull his troops out if the arab 
dispute with israel is handled simultaneously 
the united states has long been committed to a mideast 
settlement in which israel would exchange territory for arab 
recognition of its right to exist 
bush said a military pullout by saddam could clear the way for 
iraq and kuwait to permanently settle their territorial 
differences 
and yet bush said the worlds key task now first and 
always must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be 
tolerated or rewarded 
later talking with reporters bush said his comment about 
opportunities created by an iraqi withdrawal did not mark any 
change in policy and was not designed to convey flexibility or 
shift in position 
he said he did not intend to suggest that kuwait should make any 
territorial concessions youve got to make whole kuwait the way 
it was 
bush also said it was possible that saddam will make a 
180degree turn and pull out of kuwait 
however the president said there would be great unease 
about a simple return to the preinvasion status quo if it left 
saddam with a very troublesome capability of military power 
the international community would have to have something to 
say about that bush said im sure that neighbors would want 
to know that there was not a risk of another reckless invasion of 
this nature 
in his speech bush did not mention his oftstated demand that 
the exiled emir of kuwait be restored to power yet he told 
reporters later that the restoration of kuwaits leaders is a 
terribly important part of any settlement 
bush assured saddam that we seek no advantages for ourselves 
in the gulf 
he said the 165000 us troops defending the oilfields of saudi 
arabia were sent there at the request of the saudi government 
following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the american people and this president want every single 
american soldier brought home as soon as the mission is 
accomplished he said 
bush praised the soviet union for collaborating with the united 
states in a worldwide cutoff of trade with iraq the superpowers 
had indeed put four decades of history behind us he said 
more than ever before bush said the united nations is now a 
center for international collective security 
bush has met with more than 20 leaders here over the past three 
days and he said he was encouraged by reports that saddam is 
beginning to understand that it is him against the world 
bush also said there is more optimism in various quarters 
that the sanctions are really beginning to bite hard 
even so us officials said sunday the two superpowers as well 
as a number of other countries had begun preliminary drafting of 
resolutions to authorize the use of force against iraq if saddam 
does not withdraw his troops

the house appropriations committee voted 
monday to boost spending by the national endowment for the arts to 
180 million next year and rebuffed attempts to abolish the agency 
or impose new antiobscenity curbs on the projects it subsidizes 
the committee in effect ducked the politically explosive issue 
of federal support for obscene art in favor of house floor 
action later this week on a separate proposal to shift the 
responsibility for deciding what is obscene from the nea to the 
courts 
an nea compromise being patched together by reps pat williams 
dmont and e thomas coleman rmo is tentatively scheduled for 
floor debate starting wednesday or thursday 
the pair circulated the outlines of a proposed compromise among 
their house colleagues for comment monday but williams said there 
was no final agreement 
their proposal reportedly would extend the neas life for five 
years and drop the strict obscenity ban congress slapped on the 
agency last fall at the request of sen jesse helms rnc 
instead it would embrace a bipartisan senate measure that would 
require the nea to get its money back from any grant recipient who 
is convicted of violating obscenity laws the guilty artist would 
be barred from receiving any new federal grants for at least three 
years 
in a gesture to the neas congressional critics the 
williamscoleman compromise reportedly would include a modest 
increase in the current 20 percent portion of federal funds 
allocated to state arts agencies 
the bills new proposed 275 percent share for the states is far 
less than the 60 percent originally proposed by the conservative 
coleman who also had sought a ban on nea support for any works 
that violate the supreme courts obscenity standards 
the 180 million the appropriations committee approved for the 
beleaguered arts endowment would be a 5 percent increase in its 
current 171 million budget 
the nea an independent federal agency spends most of the money 
on grants to artists and arts institutions that mut be matched by 
private funds 
at the urging of rep sidney yates dill a staunch nea 
supporter the committee resoundingly defeated by voice vote a 
proposal by rep tom delay rtexas to eliminate all funds for the 
endowment until congress votes to extend its life in separate 
legislation 
some people want to abolish the nea and this is what this 
amendment is all about rep bob carr dmich told his 
colleagues if you are for this amendment you are for the end of 
the national endowment for the arts yates said 
under heavy pressure from yates and other committee democrats 
rep ralph regula rohio withdrew a proposed amendment that would 
have banned subsidies for obscene or indecent works and required 
the nea to support art that is appropriate for a general 
audience 
democrats said regulas proposal was so vaguely worded it could 
not be enforced and might be ruled unconstitutional on the ground 
that it involved prior restraint on an artists first amendment 
guarantees of freedom of expression 
the committee bowed to pleas by yates and rep vic fazio 
dcalif that it sidestep the obscene art issue in favor of 
house action on a williamscoleman compromise later this week 
the neas proposed 180 million spending budget for fiscal 1991 
which began monday was included in a 145 billion appropriations 
bill for a variety of federal agencies including the interior and 
energy departments the forest service and the smithsonian 
institution 
the committee approved the bill by voice vote and sent it to the 
house floor

budget negotiators agreed on a 1991 level of 
military spending that pits president bush and the senate against 
the house 
unbelievable rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior 
member of the house armed services committee said monday as 
members closely examined the details of the broad plan that 
includes tax increases and spending cuts 
defense spending authority in the fiscal year that began monday 
would total 289 billion in the compromise worked out by white 
house and congressional bargainers 
that was the same total proposed by sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee earlier this year 
and adopted by the full senate in its version of the defense bill 
in august 
although he originally proposed 307 billion in military 
spending back in january bush accepted the 289 billion amount in 
a speech this summer and the white house has endorsed the figure 
the house last month approved a 283 billion defense bill that 
would slash more than 2 billion from the strategic defense 
initiative halt production of the b2 bomber and cut troop 
strength by 129500 
the senate legislation would cut 1 billion from the sdi budget 
and reduce us troop strength by 100000 but leave the b2 stealth 
bomber program intact 
i think the defense numbers are reasonable and i certainly can 
support those nunn said of the negotiators agreement in an 
interview monday 
members of the house and senate planned to meet tuesday to begin 
crafting a final defense package for fiscal 1991 from their two 
widely divergent bills 
house democrats and republicans on the armed services committee 
expressed the hope that lawmakers in their chamber would not give 
in to the senate and the administration 
i really hope we dont retreat and stand our ground at 283 
billion said rep larry hopkins rky who envisioned lawmakers 
adding 6 billion of their pet projects to reach the higher number 
they dont ever have any trouble ratcheting up theyll find a 
good cause hopkins said 
lawmakers also expressed concern over the absence of the cost of 
operation desert shield the us military deployment in the 
persian gulf from the budget compromise 
defense secretary dick cheney has estimated that the buildup 
could cost about 15 billion in fiscal 1991 
schroeder suggested that the 6 billion difference between the 
house and senate numbers could be used for operation desert shield

notification but the rest of the world didnt said rep sherwood 
boehlert rny if in the future there is a credible threat 
there will be a mechanism for notification so that people can have

the faa also would be required to hire federal security managers 
at highrisk domestic airports and foreign security liaisons at 
those overseas airline and airport employees with access to 
security areas would have to undergo background checks and new 
training 
to coordinate the activities the legislation establishes a new 
assistant secretarys position in the transportation department for 
security and a similar new assistant administrators post at the 
faa 
it would provide the families of the victims aboard pan am 103 
the same tax relief provided to families of government employees 
aboard the flight which exploded dec 21 1988 killing a total of 
270 people aboard and on the ground 
the state department would be required to negotiate agreements 
with other nations to achieve the enhanced security measures at

a twoyear study of wic operations in five 
states showed monday the supplemental feeding program can reduce 
medical costs of caring for lowincome pregnant women and their 
babies 
the study of the special supplemental food program for women 
infants and children was ordered by congress in 1987 to help 
determine savings in medicaid costs during the first 60 days after 
birth 
typically the wic program provides improved nutrition for poor 
women during pregnancy and for them and their infants after birth 
from its beginning in 1972 the wic program has grown to a 21 
billion operation this year with an enrollment of 45 million women 
and children medicaid is a joint federal and state program that 
covers medical costs of lowincome people 
the 11 million study was done for the departments food and 
nutrition service by mathematica policy research inc of princeton 
nj 
department officials said the study strongly indicated that 
wic participation during pregnancy is associated with reduced 
medicaid costs and increased birth weight 
the study involved births and costs in florida minnesota north 
carolina south carolina and texas over periods in 1987 and 1988 
among the findings were increased birth weights and reduced 
medicaid costs involving the women and their babies 
however the study cautioned that there are considerable 
variations among the wic and medicaid programs operated by 
individual states and that situations are changing rapidly 
these problems are compounded by the exclusion of other 
indigent care costs from the study which means only a partial 
picture of the healthcare costs of lowincome women and newborns 
is available it said 
even so the benefits of wic participation by medicaid 
recipients were so clearly demonstrated in all five study states 
with all their population and program differences that a 
nationwide in 1987 would have shown positive benefits the report 
said 
looking to the future researchers said medicaid expansion is 
allowing a higherincome group of pregnant women to enroll and that 
many of those are likely to participate in wic 
conversely aggressive outreach and improved eligibility 
procedures may bring a higherrisk group of pregnant women into the 
medicaid and the wic programs the report said the net effect 
of these enrollment changes on estimates of wic benefits is 
uncertain 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said in a statement that 
the study reaffirms the success of the wic program and 
underscores our emphasis on serving pregnant women and infants as 
wics top priority 
yeutter said that in 1974 as an assistant secretary of 
agriculture he cut the ribbon launching the first wic program 
facility in pineville ky

the beirut newspaper addiyar reported 
monday that presidents hafez assad of syria and hashemi rafsanjani 
of iran have agreed on a stepbystep plan to free western hostages 
in lebanon 
the conservative daily citing unnamed diplomatic sources said 
assad worked out the accord in talks with rafsanjani last week in 
tehran 
hours later the south lebanon army an israelibacked militia 
announced it freed 40 shiite moslem detainees to mark the birthday 
of the prophet mohammed founder of islam 
shiite kidnappers holding most of the 13 missing westerners 
including six americans have repeatedly demanded the mainly 
christian south lebanon army free the 340 moslems it holds in 
exchange for releasing their captives 
in new york white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the united states welcomes the move and said it is consistent 
with our position that for humanitarian reasons all persons being 
detained without legal basis in the middle east should be released 
immediately 
as president bush has indicated the release of american 
hostages would help improve our relations with countries 
contributing to that release 
other westerners held are four britons including anglican 
church envoy terry waite two west germans and an italian most are 
believed held by shiite factions linked to the fundamentalist 
hezbollah or party of god it is tehrans main ally in lebanon 
there was no way to assess the authenticity of the addiyar 
report the iranian embassy in beirut and the headquarters of the 
syrian security force in the lebanese capitals moslem sector 
declined comment 
but the report came amid indications that efforts to free the 
captives were gathering momentum amid the persian gulf crisis set 
off by iraqs aug2 invasion of kuwait 
among the signals 
irans ambassador to pakistan a country used by the americans 
as a conduit into tehran said shortly before assads visit to 
tehran that some hostages could be freed soon 
tehran and london restored relations last week ending a 
19month rift 
addiyar said the release process would begin not in lebanon 
but in iran with tehrans freeing british businessman roger cooper 
within the next few days to warm up the newly resumed diplomatic 
ties between britain and iran 
cooper has been in prison in tehran since 1985 for allegedly 
spying iran says he was convicted last year but never disclosed 
his sentence 
addiyar said the next step would be release of british hostages 
held by proiranian shiite extremists in lebanon in a matter of 
days after coopers release 
the third stage was said to be starting serious negotiations for 
releasing the six us hostages simultaneously with unfreezing 
iranian assets held in the united states since 1979 
washington last month agreed to hand over assets worth at least 
200 million and sources close to a usiranian tribunal in the 
hague have said larger claims are nearing settlement 
most of the hostages have been held three years or more the 
longest held is american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
the south lebanon army commander retired lebanese army gen 
antoine lahd said monday the 40 shiites were freed specifically to 
celebrate the prophets birthday an event traditionally marked in 
arab countries by freeing prisoners 
lahd told the voice of the south radio station i also took 
into consideration their humanitarian condition he did not 
elaborate

new englands first shelter for homeless veterans 
honored by president bush as a point of light faces possible 
closure because of state budget cuts 
to do this is unconscionable ken smith president of the 
shelter said monday these guys have already paid the price 
officials of the financially strapped state said they were 
considering closing the new england shelter for homeless veterans 
and one other homeless shelter in the greater boston area that 
could put nearly 400 people onto the streets 
mayor raymond flynn said sunday he might sue state officials if 
they do cut funds to the shelters 
i believe its a violation of the law to not provide 
protection and help for needy people flynn said by cutting 
back these programs theyre leaving these people on the streets to 
die 
human services secretary philip johnston said he will meet with 
flynn this week to try to save shelter funding 
well do everything possible to help johnston said well 
try to find cuts elsewhere to soften the impact on direct care 
soldiers homes in holyoke and chelsea also are threatened 
gov michael s dukakis announced last week the state would 
close the soldiers homes as part of a series of budget cuts as the 
state struggles to balance its budget officials said the soldiers 
homes could remain open if the legislature can find equivalent cuts 
elsewhere 
western massachusetts lawmakers met monday at the holyoke 
soldiers home and said they would fight a closing tentatively set 
for april 1 
to even propose that this institution be closed is really 
absolutely ridiculous so im confident that the governor will know 
that we will fight him tooth and nail on this and that if he hasnt 
gotten involved in a fight with western massachusetts people 
before hes got one on his hands now said state rep carmen 
buell 
the boston veterans shelter opened in january and receives about 
70000 a month from the state which marks about 90 percent of its 
budget 
smith said he was working on contingency plans and trying to 
get veterans organizations in the state to draw their wagons 
around us 
also the veterans shelter was making an appeal to bush for 
help smith said adding that the project received a point of 
light award from the white house for community service 
were one of the thousand points of lights smith said 
well see what that means 
flynn called on gubernatorial candidates john r silber and 
william f weld to announce whether they support cuts in homeless 
services 
if they do not support them the cuts should not happen 
flynn said there are only three months left in this 
administration the next governor will be taking office with 
hundreds of people in the streets

acts of persecution and harsh antisemitism among 
nazi collaborators were relived and reexamined monday 50 years 
after the start of a notorious crackdown that led to the deaths of 
more than 73000 french jews 
we must not blame the nazi occupation for what was the sole 
responsibility of the legitimate french government the laws met 
only utter silence from the french people said former justice 
minister robert badinter who presided over the daylong symposium 
on the vichy laws 
vichy was obsessed with taking measures against jews 
badinter told about 250 people at the conference 
the vichy laws named for the vichy government that 
controlled unoccupied france and territories from 1940 to 1943 
prevented frances 350000 jews from holding public office 
teaching attending university owning stores and working in the 
media it was implemented 11 weeks after paris fell to the germans 
the laws later reinforced by measures to send jews to 
concentration camps defined who is a jew using criteria far 
more sweeping than the racial laws drafted by the nazis 
nazi hunter serge klarsfeld estimated 3000 jews died from cold 
and starvation from 1940 to 1942 in frenchrun camps where there 
wasnt a single german soldier 
in all 76000 jews were deported to death camps from france 
about 2500 survived historians estimate 
the jewish laws did not come out of the blue because 
antisemitism existed in france well before the german victory in 
june 1940 said henri amouroux a historian at the symposium 
sponsored by the center for contemporary jewish documentation and 
the sons and daughters of jews deported from the france 
antisemitism developed in the 1930s in a climate of economic 
and social crisis thousands of jews chased out of poland and 
austria fleeing the nazis came to france and were accused of 
taking jobs he said 
historians say the vichy laws were a cornerstone of a rightwing 
ideology that sought to undo the liberalizing human 
rightsoriented reforms of the french revolution 
the laws erased the advances made during the age of 
enlightenment said zev sternhell a history professor at the 
university of jerusalem they reflect a new concept of the 
nation not as a melting pot but as an extended family with 
everybody having the same blood 
for historian denis peschansky the laws were a way for marshal 
philippe petain vichys leader to explain the french military 
defeat and punish those deemed responsible 
petain had to find reasons within french society for the 
debacle he certainly couldnt blame the army because it was in 
power so he blamed the jews communists freemasons and other 
foreigners peschansky said 
the laws also revoked the citizenship of about 400000 jews in 
colonial algeria and morocco and tunisia which were french 
protectorates 
my mother who had six small children and worked in the 
arsenal in algiers was fired immediately said a woman in the 
audience 
other survivors described the discrimination and persecution 
that followed 
in september 1943 samuel and rachel ewenczyk closed their dry 
goods store in grenoble fleeing to the alps to escape deportation 
one week later thanks to the vichy laws the french police 
requisitioned the store as a jewish store and sold it to a 
nonjewish person mrs ewenczyk 78 recalled 
after grenoble was liberated by us troops in august 1944 the 
family returned to claim the property 
the man in the shop protested saying he had bought the shop 
but my husband asked who did you buy it from i never sold it 
we were back in business a week later she said 
the vichy government named for a city in central france was 
never recognized by the allies the nazis annulled the armistice 
with vichy after the allies invaded north africa in november 1943 
and occupied france

its a jungle out there on the streets of 
suburban lisle 
so village officials have hired four brookfield zoo police 
officers to slam the brakes on motorists speeding through the city 
and trying to escape the crowded highways that bisect the 
community 
lisle police chief harold fitzsimmons hired the four as 
parttime community service officers in february armed with city 
police vehicles and radar guns the officers have issued almost 
1000 tickets to motorists speeding down lisles residential 
streets 
fitzsimmons indicated he chose the zoo officers because they 
knew how to soothe an angry motorists temper 
these guys know how to interact with people the paid visitor 
comes to the zoo for a pleasant visit and the officers are there 
mostly to help them out fitzsimmons explained in a telephone 
interview from the suburb which is about 10 miles west of chicago 
such skills are useful while patrolling lisles streets the zoo 
officers said although the brookfield officers graduated from the 
same police academy that trained lisles 25 regular patrol 
officers they dont carry guns or make arrests while on patrol 
i see how people are always in a hurry and they always have an 
excuse on a residential street theres no reason to be doing 14 
or 15 miles an hour over the speed limit said lee zeitlin one 
of the four zoo officers 
fitzsimmons said that under the suburbs program motorists 
cited by zeitlin and his colleagues face a 25 fine rather than 
the minimum 50 fine mandated by the state most motorists choose 
to pay the fine which goes directly to lisle because drivers are 
cited for violating village laws not state traffic regulations 
if the motorist pays the fine city officials dont report the 
violation to the county clerk and the violation never appears on 
the drivers record fitzsimmons noted 
as a result not everyone is sold on the traffic program 
dupage county circuit clerk john cockell said monday that the 
citys traffic enforcement program may violate state laws 
i think theyre jumping around the law cockrell said 
all traffic citations must be reported to the circuit court 
within 48 hours thats the law if theyre not doing that theyve 
got a problem he said 
bob kay village attorney said city officials are trying to 
determine whether the program complies with state law

energy department officials raised more 
questions than they answered monday about whether an ohio atomic 
weapons facility would permanently stop producing uranium and shift 
to cleaning up decades of radioactive wastes 
henson moore the departments deputy secretary first announced 
during a briefing with reporters that a decision had been made to 
never produce uranium again at the fernald plant near 
cincinnati 
instead he said the plant would concentrate on cleanup and 
development of cleanup technologies that also might be used at 
other weapons facilities with contamination problems 
within hours however a department spokesman disavowed moores 
characterization and said no decision on production would be made 
until january the department said that management at fernald had 
been shifted to the doe office in charge of cleanup activities 
the plant which faces a major cleanup problem from past lax 
production procedures has not produced weapons grade uranium since 
july 1989 the 1000 plant employees have been awaiting word on 
whether production would ever resume 
some fear a shift away from production eventually would shut 
down the facility 
moore raised the issue of uranium production at fernald in 
opening remarks at a briefing with reporters saying he had wanted 
to take the opportunity to disclose that energy secretary james 
watkins had decided making permanent what has been de facto for 
about a year 
it fernald will never produce uranium again moore said 
although not contesting what moore had said department 
spokesmen later said an actual decision by the department on the 
production question at fernald is not expected to be made until 
january 
were probably on the road to closing down production said 
department spokesman bill griffin the decision will be made in 
january whether to at any point resume production or permanently 
turn the facility over to a cleanup mode 
dan darmond a spokesman for moore later also acknowledged 
that a decision on the production issue at fernald is not 
completely finalized but said the department was planning to 
stop uranium production at the ohio facility 
uranium production has been suspended since july 1989 because of 
the facilities environmental problems including widespread 
contamination as a result of past lax production practices 
moore said he didnt anticipate that a permanent halt in 
production would cause job losses at fernald instead the work at 
the 1000acre complex 18 miles from cincinnati would focus 
exclusively on cleanup safely packaging contaminated materials and 
developing new cleanup technologies he said 
the fernald plant was opened in 1951 to process uranium for 
atomic weapons the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials at the 
plant has been estimated at 1 billion to 5 billion 
stored at the plant are more than 500000 metric tons of 
radioactive wastes dating from current plant operations to the 
world war iiera manhattan project to develop the atomic bomb 
meanwhile sen john glenn dohio said the decision to shift 
management authority from does production side to the cleanup 
offices was a major step toward ending uranium production fernald 
and should trigger a retraining program for workers 
according to my legislation which was passed last year the 
end of fernalds production mission requires doe to have a job 
retraining plan for existing workers glenn said through his 
press office

israel will start distributing gas masks to its 
entire population of 47 million citizens next week following iraqi 
threats to attack the jewish state with chemical weapons the army 
announced monday 
each kit contains a gas mask a syringe with a nerve gas 
antidote and purifying powder instructions will be in hebrew 
arabic english and russian 
the announcement followed assessments of an increased threat of 
war in the persian gulf and foreign reports suggesting that israel 
has decided to absorb iraqs possible first strike without taking 
preemptive action 
distribution was advanced by two months and ended a heated 
public debate chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said sunday it 
was originally planned to issue gas masks in december 
officials had feared an immediate distribution of gas masks 
could panic the israelis or send iraq an incorrect message that 
israel planned an attack 
the army sought to allay public concern saying distribution 
of gas masks in no way whatsoever constitutes a change to an 
emergency status 
the purpose is to transfer the kits to citizens homes 
to shorten the time of distribution should a need arise 
army spokesman brig gen nachman shai maintained the 
distribution plan was developed long before the gulf crisis and 
other officials say iraqi president saddam hussein is unlikely to 
attack israel but that his actions are unpredictable 
the spokesman said sealed gas mask kits will be distributed next 
week in three towns in the center of israel the negev desert and 
the north starting oct 15 kits will be handed out at schools 
throughout israel beginning with cities and expanding to rural 
areas 
distribution announcements have gone to onethird of israelis 
living in towns israel radio said shai estimated the overall 
distribution will take weeks 
shai said foreign residents also will get masks and masks would 
be available for tourists at hotels he expressed hope the armys 
decision would not deter foreigners from visiting 
the spokesman said 140000 arabs living in the annexed east 
jerusalem will be issued gas masks 
he said purchase of the kits has begun for the 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip but they 
will have to pay the 100plus cost because they are not covered by 
israeli national insurance 
shai said the public will be ordered to keep the kits sealed 
under threat of legal punishment special sirens are supposed to 
sound a chemical attack warning he said 
experts have said israel could have little warning of attack 
zeev eitan a military analyst at tel aviv universitys jaffe 
center for strategic studies said israel could get a sixminute 
early warning if it got immediate data from us spy satellites 
debate about distributing gas masks began in april when saddam 
threatened to hit israel with binary chemical weapons and make 
fire eat half of israel in retaliation for an israeli nuclear 
attack 
israel in 1981 bombed a nuclear reactor near baghdad saying 
iraq was using it to develop weapons 
saddams threats intensified after iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
but shai insisted there is no urgency in the distribution 
now we dont have any actual information stating god forbid that 
hostilities will start tonight or tomorrow or in a week or two 
still signs of public anxiety emerged minutes after the army 
announcement 
i never thought that would happen when i heard it today my 
first thought was oh my god this is not a joke said margo 
iyoun a 29yearold immigrant from orinda calif 
coming and living in israel that for me was an idealistic 
thing but its hard to leave anything on the level of idealism 
when you have a child 
the only previous distribution of gas masks was experimental it 
was conducted 1 years ago in two towns and was declared successful 
after the army found the population kept the kits in good shape

the supreme court on monday agreed to review a 
1 million legal fee that the seller of a louisiana television 
station was ordered to pay in a breachofcontract case 
the court said it will examine the power of federal judges to 
order such payments 
the case stems from a 1983 agreement in which nasco inc a 
tennessee company signed a contract to buy kplctv in lake 
charles la for 18 million from g russell chambers 
nasco later sued accusing chambers of breaking the contract 
a federal judge ruled that chambers acted in bad faith in 
conducting his defense in the suit and in 1989 ordered chambers to 
pay about 1 million in legal fees to nasco 
the ruling was upheld in february by the 5th us circuit court 
of appeals 
in his appeal to the supreme court chambers said louisiana 
state law provided no basis for the attorney fee award he said the 
award was unreasonable and violated his rights 
the case is chambers vs nasco 90256

new requirements to improve the quality of 
nursing home care went into effect monday but nursing home owners 
say they will have trouble complying without adequate state funding 
or implementing regulations 
the comprehensive nursing home reforms were passed by congress 
in 1987 setting requirements for nursing homes to follow to 
participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 
those include provisions on quality of living conditions access 
to social activities accommodation of personal needs assessments 
for health care services protection of residents personal funds 
and privacy 
other provisions require confidentiality of medical records 
limitations on the use of physical and chemical restraints choice 
of personal attending physicians and access to telephones 
some of the regulations to implement the new requirements are in 
place but nursing home owners have complained that regulations for 
critical provisions of the law have not been issued 
gail wilensky head of the health care financing administration 
which handles medicare and medicaid said the majority of the 
regulations were in place and those that arent yet final soon will 
be 
states consumer groups and nursing home industry groups have 
been consulted and have been fully informed of the new requirements 
as we have developed and issued guidelines instructions and 
regulations during the past three years she said 
in a petition to the department of health and human services 
the american health care association said many states have not 
allocated adequate funds to implement the law 
the association representing 10000 nursing homes asked 
wilenskys agency to issue regulatory guidance to the states 
outlining what actions the federal government will take to ensure 
that state plans are funded

feasting on a big mac is going to take even a 
bigger bite out of soviet wallets 
mcdonalds has nearly doubled the price of the twopatty 
hamburger in moscow where a meal at the restaurant has become 
practically unaffordable for the average soviet citizen the 
government newspaper izvestia reported monday 
the price hike to 695 rubles more than four hours pay for 
the average soviet worker was attributed to the rising cost of 
meat a newspaper reported monday 
the oak brook illbased fastfood chain has been serving more 
than 1 million customers a month in moscow since the restuarant 
opened in january previously a big mac cost 375 rubles 
restaurants in state hotels charge 2 to 3 rubles for an entree 
while private restaurants may demand up to 50 rubles the exchange 
rate for rubles varies greatly 
in chicago near mcdonalds headquarters a big mac costs 195 
officials at mcdonalds headquarters could not be reached for 
comment 
the pricehike decision was made by the board of the joint 
sovietcanadian mcdonalds venture after the soviet government 
announced it was increasing prices for meat and other products this 
month according to m tulupnikova business manager of the moscow 
mcdonalds the worlds largest 
the ingredients are produced locally at a 50 million factory 
built by mcdonalds of canada 
the newspaper said the line at the restaurant wasnt noticably 
smaller monday because of the price increase 
during the summer some customers waited up to 90 minutes to 
reach the counter 
last month the official tass news agency reported that it 
would be wrong to say that all muscovites are satisfied with 
mcdonalds 
some are deterred by high prices it said visitors spend 
on average about 10 rubles in the shop for many this is much 
more than their daily pay 
mcdonalds plans to build 19 more restaurants in the soviet 
capital

if she sells sea shells by the seashore so 
will corporate america 
targeting los angeles countys big beachgoing crowd advertisers 
are slapping their messages on trash barrels phone booths tide 
charts and county beach vehicles 
the wave of ads could swell with a law passed last week in 
sacramento that generally expands advertisers access to the coast 
its not as if were trying to sell every square inch of 
beach said dusty brogan who oversees marketing for the countys 
beaches everything has to be harmonious with the surroundings 
wed never permit something like freestanding billboards 
the county is considering the sale of ad space on bicycle racks 
and benches to a swimwear maker and wants to post oversized 
thermometers underwritten by advertisers on lifeguard towers 
officials say the advertising will raise muchneeded funds for 
the upkeep of 31 miles of los angeles county beach property the 
beaches which cost about 17 million to maintain and patrol 
operate at an annual deficit of about 7 million 
the county could eventually bring in up to 4 million in 
additional yearly revenue from various beach marketing programs 
brogan said 
how else are we going to keep services up she asked 
where do we go 
the board of supervisors must approve each facet of the program 
the ad expansion also is being closely watched by environmental 
groups 
in los angeles going to the beach is the closest many people 
come to a natural environment said peter saundry chairman of 
the sierra clubs regional clean coastal waters task force 
its of concern to us any time advertisers show up on the 
beach but we realize the county is in a tricky situation he 
said environmental groups like ours are pushing them to clean up 
the beaches but those things do cost money 
the new law which goes into effect jan 1 broadens the 
authority of counties to sell ad space and license their property 
los angeles county is considering licensing a clothing line similar 
to that worn by lifeguards 
companies that have tried beach ads include the maker of 
gatorade sports drink who paid the county 12500 to place clocks 
featuring the gatorade logo on 120 lifeguard towers this year 
if the ad is relevant to what someone is doing thinking or 
buying at the beach it makes a lot of sense said advertising 
executive alan pando president of ddb needham west 
but it would be too bad if the beach ended up looking like 
nascar he added referring to the car racing circuit featuring 
autos plastered with sponsors logos 
longtime lifeguard larry kraus is philosophical about the ad 
blitz 
look at all this graffiti he said pointing to a lifeguard 
tower at venice beach on the scale of things that bother you at 
the beach advertising is very low

salvadoran president alfredo cristiani on 
monday proposed a ceasefire with leftist rebels in a bid to 
improve the atmosphere for peace talks 
the truce would take effect as soon as the guerrillas declare a 
reciprocal ceasefire cristiani said in a speech to the general 
assembly 
peace in el salvador will not come out of the muzzle of any 
rifle cristiani said there is no reason for war in el 
salvador we do not want war 
the fifth round of unmediated peace talks between the 
government and rebels ended in a stalemate sept 18 
cristiani who took office june 1989 also pledged to end abuses 
in the salvadoran armed forces the military has been linked to 
death squad activity against peasants and labor activists 
suspected of liberal or leftist tendencies human rights observers 
say 
a ceasefire arranged last year collapsed after several union 
halls were attacked and labor organizers were slain 
the rebels blamed the killings on the government and launched 
an offensive on the capital of san salvador 
last november during the height of the guerrilla attacks men 
dressed in army uniforms killed six jesuit priests who had 
criticized government policy their cook and her daughter were also 
slain 
cristiani said his government was not involved in the jesuit 
slayings but an army unit has been identified as being 
responsible 
in late 1989 a un human rights report said cristianis 
government presided over a resurgence of torture that included 
sexual abuse and beatings of prisoners and executions of political 
opponents 
the annual report by jose antonio pastor ridruejo a special 
representative of the un commission on human rights criticized 
both the government and leftist rebels 
pastor blamed the rebels for assassinating alleged collaborators 
with the armed forces among others 
salvadoran authorities said the claims of torture were part of a 
campaign by the rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation 
movement 
the united states has heavily subsidized the salvadoran 
government during the 11year civil war currently spending about 
1 million daily in foreign and military aid 
the us senate appropriations committee however is 
considering a bill to withhold half of the us military aid to el 
salvador for a year in retaliation for the slayings of the jesuits 
and other abuses by the army

a weekend budget agreement in washington 
headed off federal spending slahes but eight buildings at 
independence national historic park closed monday to save money 
anyway 
we knew in march that we were looking at a possible shortfall 
in the range of 850000 said bernard goodman assistant park 
superintendent we began reducing our hires of guides 
substituting temporary workers who were hired through the month of 
september 
the tight budget is expected to last through the fiscal year so 
the buildings may not reopen until next october goodman said 
closed were old city hall the home of the us supreme court 
from 1791 to 1800 the reconstructed graff house where thomas 
jefferson drafted the declaration of independence the 2nd bank of 
the us pemberton house which houses artifacts of the army and 
navy new hall a museum dedicated to the marine corps the todd 
house a refurnished quaker home where dolly todd better known as 
dolly madison from a later marriage lived and the bishop white 
house a refurnished historic house 
also about 30 temporary guides were fired according to 
goodman 
goodman said more of the parks 19 historic buildings may be 
closed he didnt say which ones 
we chose this particular group because they are lesserused 
buildings in the park he said we have decided that under no 
circumstances will we close independence hall the liberty bell 
pavilion or the park visitor center 
during 1989 goodman said attendance at the nowclosed sites 
ranged from 12869 at the bishop white house to 140036 at the 2nd 
bank of the us by contrast more than 1400000 people visited 
the liberty bell pavilion last year he said 
a spokesman for the national park service said parks across the 
country are squeezed for funds and many can cut back on such things 
as lawnmowing the philadelphia park doesnt have that 
flexibility he said 
goodman said mondays actions had nothing to do with the 
grahamrudman budget balancing law which would have forced 
acrosstheboard cuts in federal spending and even more cutbacks 
here and at other parks those cuts were averted by the sunday 
budget agreement in washington dc 
in washington park system spokesman duncan morrow said all of 
the national parks are acutely aware that government spending must 
be kept under control the only difference is that the cutbacks at 
independence national historic park may be a little more 
dramatic because about the only way to save is to close down 
buildings 
plenty of parks have to shorten hours at various facilities 
close them on certain days a week or reduce their maintenance 
schedule he said 
but at independence hall cutting back on maintenance is 
different from cutting back on lawn mowing at some of our other 
parks when you cut back on maintaining a historic structure it 
has a snowballing effect and the rate of decline accelerates 
rapidly particulary in the face of heavy public use

a police department report on how to deal with 
the citys crime wave is due on mayor david dinkins desk and 
officials said monday the mayor will call for a tax on every 
paycheck earned in the city to help fund it 
under the fixedrate tax someone earning 50000 a year would 
pay 50 in the first year and 75 in subsequent years and 
employers would have to match their employees payments said a 
city hall source speaking on condition of anonymity 
in albany gov mario cuomo was noncommittal about whether the 
legislature would approve the tax plan 
well know quickly if theres any interest in doing it 
because its an election year cuomo said 
republican sen nicholas a spano said he would try to organize 
opposition to the tax 
at a time when suburbanites property taxes are already a 
burden and their own municipal services are strained its unfair 
to expect them to pay for more of new york citys needs he said 
the police department report due on the mayors desk monday 
night is expected to shape the citys response to a flurry of 
violent highly publicized street crimes 
dinkins said he would discuss the report with police 
commissioner lee brown on tuesday when he also is expected to 
announce plans to put 880 more police officers on subway duty 
the additional transit police would patrol trains from 8 pm to 
4 am fulfilling one of dinkins campaign promises to put a cop 
on each train at night 
dinkins declined to comment on the number of extra police he 
wants or how he would pay for them but agreed commuters should be 
taxed theyre using city services and of course i want them to 
pay for it he said 
last week the mayor said that other revenue options included a 
raise in real estate taxes and a 25cent surcharge on 1 state 
lottery tickets sold in the city 
it appears dinkins wants the new payroll tax to cover half the 
initial cost of the new officers all workers would be taxed at the 
same rate no matter their income the tax would start at onetenth 
of 1 percent next july and jump by half a year later the sources 
said 
brown was expected to recommend the hiring of 6000 more 
officers and another 2700 civilians to free officers from desk 
jobs 
but the new officers wont be on the streets for months and 
possibly years the police academy can handle 2600 students at one 
time by splitting classes into two shifts it takes six months to 
train an officer

their rights and responsibilities with regard to berlin and germany 
are suspended the document said 
it added that the suspension will run until the treaty itself

its annual dues in a lump sum in the last months of the year 
bush told the general assembly on monday my administration is 
fully committed to supporting the united nations and to paying 
what we are obligated to pay by our commitment to the charter

united nations progress and recommended resumption of full 
funding

heavy artillery fired on charles taylors rebel army 
the force also began taking up positions around the executive 
mansion where about 1000 soldiers from the army of slain 
president samuel doe remain holed up 
the firing signaled an end to a weekold truce but that 
ceasefire had proved largely ineffective mondays action could 
force a quick conclusion to the fighting that has cut this capital 
city off from the outside world for three months 
a second rebel faction under prince johnson has threatened to 
launch an allout assault on taylors rebels and the remnants of 
does army if the task force failed to intervene 
the force composed of more than 5000 soldiers from nigeria 
ghana sierra leone guinea and gambia has come under criticism

killed at least 5000 people here even a peace in monrovia was not 
enforced 
a new field commander was sent in last week under nigerian gen 
joshua dogonyaro tanks and armored cars from the five nations

that the west african force act 
he told reporters if i do not see them out there there will 
be trouble i am ready to mount my missiles and attack the mansion

ready to move against charles taylor since aside from doe taylor 
is my second target

johnson supports the peace plan proposed by the economic 
community of west african states it calls for an interim 
government to oversee elections restoring a civilian government 
taylor opposes a transitional government and has declared 
himself president 
the move east by the task force also could be an effort to take 
the citys airfield which could be used by nigerian jets a radio 
station used by taylor to castigate the task force also is near the 
airport and task force commanders would like to seize it

rangers and tourists 
celebrated yosemites unique status as the granite gem of the 
sierra on the parks 100th birthday monday 
a moment of silence recalling the tranquillity before humans 
came to yosemite valley highlighted a centennial ceremony in 
sundrenched sentinel meadow the silence was broken only by a blue 
jays shrieks 
yosemite is not just for today it is for the children and 
their children tomorrow said yosemite indian jay johnson 
reciting a traditional miwok indian blessing 
lee stetson who depicted naturalist john muir during the 
ceremony said wilderness is a necessity as fountains of life 
and fountains of people if enough of us go among spirits of this 
wilderness we need not despair 
president bush restricted by the middle east crisis did not 
attend as expected leaving it to other federal officials to depict 
the legacy of yosemite in the majestic sierra range 
given all the history relating to yosemite and all of its 
controversies still its a marvelous place for the american public 
to see superintendent michael finley said in an interview 
the history ranges from muirs unswerving commitment to make 
yosemite a national park in the late 1800s to lightingcaused fires 
that blackened 23000 acres this summer forcing an 11day closure 
critics blame the national park service for failing to carry out 
a 1980 plan to remove most public facilities from the narrow 
valley which is visited by 34 million people a year park service 
director james ridenour said this summer that funds will be 
budgeted to relocate maintenance facilities 
another issue involves a concession contract with yosemite park 
amp curry co a subsidiary of the mca entertainment conglomerate an 
environmental group announced plans last week to take over the 
contract to run the parks hotels restaurants and concession 
stands the contract expires in 1993 
despite such issues finley said the park service has been a 
good steward of yosemite and its famous features such as el 
capitan half dome and yosemite falls 
we believe weve seen 100 years of preservation and were 
working hard to ensure that the next 100 years are even going to be 
better for the visitors and the park finley said 
weve undertaken major programs for restoration of the 
ecology reintroduced bighorn sheep recovered peregrine falcons 
up to four nesting pairs at this point he said 
were restoring trampled down meadows replanting oak trees 
have a major program to restore the merced river and will undertake 
another program on the tuolumne river and our lakes 
no one would appear to know more of yosemites history than 
87yearold carl sharsmith who has served as a naturalist in 
tuolumne meadows almost every summer for six decades 
my duties are light sharsmith said i get a group and go 
for a bit of a walk and chat along the way three hours at the 
most 
the parks centennial is attracting more attention in the area 
than did the historic formation of the park by congress on oct 1 
1890 
back then the weekly mariposa gazette the closest community 
newspaper put the story of yosemites beginning on page 2

the prosecution rested its case monday and 
jurors got their first look at the seven robert mapplethorpe 
photographs that resulted in obscenity charges against an art 
gallery and its director 
the eightmember hamilton county municipal court jury remained 
expressionless as the photographs were passed around 
the contemporary arts center and director dennis barrie are on 
trial on misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and using 
children in nudityrelated material 
if convicted of both charges barrie could be sentenced to one 
year in jail and fined 2000 the gallery could be fined 10000 
for conviction on both counts 
the prosecution completed its case after questioning its third 
witness and entering the photographs into evidence all of the 
witnesses were police officers 
after prosecutors rested judge david albanese rejected a 
defense request to dismiss the charges and the defense began to 
present witnesses 
the seven photographs were among 175 pictures in an exhibit 
called robert mapplethorpe the perfect moment the sevenweek 
exhibit drew 80000 people before it ended may 26 
five of the photographs show sexually graphic acts involving 
men and two are of children whose genitals are exposed 
prosecutors contend all that is necessary for a conviction under 
ohio obscenity law is to prove the photos were displayed 
the bottom line is the pictures were not required to show 
contemporary community standards because the court determines 
that prosecutor frank prouty said 
the prosecution entered the photographs into evidence over 
defense lawyers objections they argued that the photos were being 
taken out of context and should be presented as part of the entire 
exhibit as they were displayed 
during questioning of the first defense witness defense lawyer 
marc mezibov gave the photos to jurors to help them understand 
remarks by the woman who assembled the exhibit 
janet kardon former director of the university of 
pennsylvanias institute of contemporary art testified that she 
worked closely with mapplethorpe in choosing photographs for the 
exhibit she said the 175 photos were culled from more than 2000 
and that each was chosen for its artistic merit 
we looked for a body of work that has consistency saying 
something that is important to say ms kardon said 
she said she felt an urgency to put the exhibit together between 
april 1987 and december 1988 because mapplethorpe was dying of 
aids he died in boston in march 1989 at age 42 
he was one of the most important photographers working in the 
80s i felt it was my responsibility as a curator to work with him 
while he was alive ms kardon said 
when asked by prosecutors to describe the artistic merit of four 
photos depicting sexually explicit acts ms kardon said they were 
artistically lighted and framed and showed symmetry and use of 
horizontal and vertical lines 
jacquelynn baas director of the university of californias art 
museum referred to texture and effectiveness of expression in 
describing the same photos 
robert mapplethorpe was an artist who set out very consciously 
and with a great deal of courage to create a wide range of art 
he very consciously explored what makes a work of art a very 
powerful experience she said 
barries lawyer h louis sirkin told jurors that the gallery 
director and its officers knew the exhibit would be controversial 
but he said they believed the educational and cultural value 
outweighed other considerations and was consistent with the 
gallerys mission to display contemporary art 
there was controversy but there was only one intent and 
purpose to add to the cultural enhancement of the citizens of 
this city and this area sirkin said 
it was brought here not to appeal to anyones prurient 
interest he said it was brought here to teach and to show 
the world this brilliant photographer and some of the inner makings 
of that man and some of the torture that perhaps he suffered

demonstrators staged a mutant pageant 
monday the eve of the 10th anniversary of the last evacuation of 
love canal to protest resettlement of the neighborhood near the 
infamous dump 
the demonstration attracted about two dozen environmental 
activists some in costume to suggest the result of ruinous 
environmental policies one woman dressed as a smiling face with 
only one eye a multilegged mutant dubbed miss environmental 
bonding was two women in one dress 
the demonstration outside the capitol included a blistering 
attack on gov mario cuomo who is running for a third term this 
year and is considered a potential 1992 democratic presidential 
candidate 
we are governor cuomos walking talking living victims and 
potential victims of his bad policies said lois gibbs a former 
love canal resident who heads the washingtonbased citizens 
clearinghouse for hazardous waste 
one demonstrator serving as pageant judge dressed as a 
caricature of cuomo with fluorescent pingpong balls coming out of 
his ears and a badge proclaiming him a parttime 
environmentalist 
among other things the activists are fighting the states 
effort to resettle part of niagara falls love canal neighborhood 
renamed black creek village in an effort to attract potential 
home buyers 
the activists also protested nuclear power and new yorks effort 
to find a dump site for its lowlevel radioactive waste 
love canal became a symbol of the nations toxic waste problem 
in the late 1970s after about 2500 people were forced to abandon 
their homes they left when 22000 tons of dioxin pcbs and other 
hazardous chemicals dumped there 30 years earlier by the hooker 
chemical co were discovered to have spread through the 
neighborhood 
the first evacuations were ordered in august 1978 
thenpresident carter ordered the last round of evacuations on oct 
2 1980 
the dump has been capped but most of the chemicals are still 
buried under a fencedoff 70acre mound state officials insist the 
area planned for resettlement is no more contaminated than 
comparable neighborhoods in niagara falls 
thomas conroy a spokesman for cuomo said state health 
department studies were the only consideration in the love canal 
resettlement 
love canals resettlement was done exclusively on the 
scientific evidence period conroy said

the government on monday 
announced the arrests of three black men in connection with a 
shooting rampage on a train that left 26 blacks dead and more than 
100 injured 
the statement by law and order minister adriaan vlok did not 
name the men or say if they were associated to a particular 
political group 
according to witnesses men with guns and machetes randomly 
attacked black commuters on an evening train sept 13 heading from 
johannesburg to the neighboring township of soweto 
the attack was one of the worst single incidents in the recent 
fighting in the townships around johannesburg about 800 blacks 
have died since early august 
most of the battles have been between the african national 
congress and the rival inkatha movement but the anc says it 
believes a third force possibly tied to the security forces 
has been orchestrating the violence 
also monday police said 11 blacks had been arrested in the

a lawyer conceded monday in opening 
arguments that his client killed the 10 women he is accused of 
murdering during the past two years 
only a fool would come up here and tell you that mr shawcross 
did not commit some of these murders or all of these murders 
thomas cocuzzi told the monroe county court jury 
arthur j shawcross 45 was arrested in january after state 
police found him near the body of one of the victims during 
questioning he told police he had killed the women during sexual 
encounters gone awry 
one of the nonissues in this case is that mr shawcross 
committed the acts that caused the deaths of these women cocuzzi 
said but conduct alone does not constitute a crime you must 
consider the context of the mental state of the accused 
cocuzzi said the defense will ask jurors to acquit shawcross by 
reason of insanity at the least he said the jury will be asked 
to reduce the charges from murder to manslaughter because he was 
emotionally disturbed at the time of the killings 
assistant county district attorney charles siragusa said in his 
opening argument that shawcross himself supplied police with their 
best evidence when he confessed 
most of the victims were prostitutes he said all were easy 
prey easily approached easily isolated easily killed and easily 
disposed of he said 
siragusa also said police found fibers on many of the victims 
bodies that matched carpeting in cars used by shawcross as well as 
other evidence linking him to the killings 
judge donald wisner granted a request to impose an order 
prohibiting members of the district attorneys office and the 
offices of the defense lawyers from publicly discussing the case 
the order does not extend to the defense lawyers themselves or to 
siragusa but does include district attorney howard relin 
defense lawyers complained that comments relin made last week to 
a newspaper about the insanity defense could affect the trial 
when he was arrested shawcross was on parole after serving 15 
years in prison for the 1972 strangling of an 8yearold girl in 
watertown his hometown shawcross also confessed to killing a 
10yearold boy there 
shawcross lawyers said during jury selection last week that 
there will be testimony that shawcross was sexually abused as a 
child and had traumatic experiences in vietnam 
he faces a later trial in wayne county for a november 1989 
strangling

the education department said monday an 
investigation has proven that a graduate mathematics program at the 
university of california at los angeles discriminated against asian 
americans 
michael williams assistant secretary for civil rights said a 
30month investigation found a statistical disparity in the rates 
of admission to the mathematics department on the basis of race 
and an inconsistency in how asian and white applicants who 
received the same evaluation ratings were treated 
there was insufficient evidence to show a nondiscriminatory 
basis for this pattern said williams 
seventyfive other departments were cleared of discrimination 
allegations while eight departments were found to have 
inconclusive records williams said 
the office of civil rights also is investigating undergraduate 
admission practices at ucla and at harvard 
as a result of the findings williams said ucla must offer 
admission to five asianamerican students who had been 
discriminatorily denied admission the university also must 
establish a uniform system of admission and improve recordkeeping 
to allow us to determine whether or not it is observing the civil 
rights laws 
ucla chancellor charles young said the university will appeal 
the violation finding because te admissions processes enrolling 15000 
students 
per year a total of 2000 student files were examined and dozens 
of interviews with students faculty and administrators were 
conducted 
the department said ucla must maintain certain records on their 
admission decisions in eight other graduate programs including the 
school of management computer science department electrical 
engineering department philosophy department biological chemistry 
department school of public health and school of architecture and 
urban planning

nearly 1000 egyptian workers died in iraq 
the past nine months and evidence from those who had autopsies 
performed showed that 60 percent of the deaths were caused by 
bullet wounds and skull fractures the government said 
interior minister abdelhalim moussa told the state newspaper 
alahram the dead were all men aged 19 to 44 moussas statement is 
set for publication tuesday but an advance copy of the report was 
obtained by the associated press 
moussa made his statement after submitting a report monday to 
president hosni mubarak about the marked increase in the number of 
egyptians dying in iraq following baghdads aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
more than 1 million egyptians most of them imported workers 
were in iraq when it invaded kuwait egypt has strongly opposed the 
invasion and has contributed thousands of troops to the 
multinational force sent to saudi arabia to defend against a 
possible iraqi attack 
there were reports before the invasion that some iraqi soldiers 
returning home after the 1988 ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
attacked egyptian workers in the belief the egytians had taken 
their jobs 
moussa said 995 bodies of egyptian workers arrived from iraq the 
past nine months and autopsies by egyptian doctors indicated 60 
percent of the deaths were caused by assault it was not 
immediately known how many autopsies were performed 
he said recent iraqi medical reports shipped with the bodies 
said the deaths resulted from bullet wounds or skull fracture but 
did not indicated the circumstances that led to the violent deaths 
before the invasion moussa said iraqi medical reports 
mentioned only natural causes for the deaths 
he said the number of deaths since the invasion has grown 
sharply but there were no reliable detailed figures 
he said the egyptian foreign ministry has asked iraq for 
detailed reports on the circumstances of the deaths and added that 
his ministry is questioning egyptian workers returning from kuwait

a highly publicized strike called by 
the leftist sandinista labor unions fizzled on monday most people 
went to work and only minor incidents were reported 
tires burned at a few intersections but drivers skirted them as 
traffic proceeded as usual for a monday morning 
a protest march called by the unions drew at most 500 people 
expecting a bigger turnout the government had assigned about 2500 
police to the route 
the only violence was the burning of the transmission tower of a 
prosandinista radio station sunday night 
the strike was called to protest an austere economic recovery 
program by president violeta chamorros government it includes 
privatizing the broad state sector trimming the public payroll and 
doing away with state subsidies to diminish the financial deficit 
those programs plus weekly devaluations of the nicaraguan 
currency the cordoba have boosted inflation to about 80 percent a 
month 
the government granted broad concessions friday hoping to head 
off strikes similar to those that crippled the nation in may and 
july labor leaders said the strike would take place anyway 
although the government announced a suspension of layoffs a food 
distribution program for peasants a commission to supervise land 
distribution and a job bank 
prosandinista newspapers ran exaggerated frontpage headlines 
monday promoting the strike call 
the people to defend themselves trumpeted barricada 
official newspaper of the sandinista front 
neighborhoods on fire a headline read in el nuevo diario 
with a second line below civic protest takes off in managua 
however enabus the government bus depot was the only site in 
managua where sandinista supporters were visible even there only a 
dozen militants showed up all helping keep the fires going 
bums why dont you go to work shouted a taxi driver at the 
supporters as they piled fresh tires on the pyres 
i dont agree with this carpenter mario mora 61 said of 
the announced strike on his way to work at the state construction 
company sovipe 
even an illiterate can understand that we cant behave like 
macho cats all the time 
its like dona violeta says if we dont work this country is 
going to go down the drain

mauritanias arabled security forces have stepped 
up a campaign of murder and torture against blacks in the northwest 
african nation amnesty international said in a report released 
tuesday 
some of the victims were decapitated or their heads were crushed 
by stones according to the londonbased human rights organization 
a year ago we said the persecution of mauritanias black 
community had reached a peak the organization said that 
appalling situation has now gone from bad to worse 
the conflict began with a 1989 border dispute between 
predominately arab mauritania and senegal a mostly black nation to 
the south the two former french colonies are separted by the 
senegal river 
amnesty said mauritanian troops have abducted and killed 
hundreds of mauritanian blacks and paraded through rural villages 
with the decapitated bodies of victims about 19 percent of mauritanias 
19 million people are black 
what is taking place in southern mauritania is in effect an 
undeclared war in which one community is using the resources and 
power of the state against another amnesty said 
in april 1989 two sengalese goat herders who crossed the border 
were shot hundreds of mauritanians and senegalese were killed in 
the ensuing clashes and tensions escalated between mauritanias 
black and arabberber communities tens of thousands of blacks were 
expelled from mauritania 
the report said the government troops were backed by haratine 
militia composed of descendants of freed black slaves who share 
arabberber culture 
people are disappearing or being killed by government 
soldiers in the south every day the report said 
people taken by troops have had their heads crushed with heavy 
stones or cut off and paraded around village centers to intimidate 
others other have been shot dead simply for fishing while a curfew 
was in force the report added 
amnesty said security forces have picked up hundreds of black 
villagers the past year and detained many without trial 
authorities have imposed curfews that vary in different areas 
the security forces seem to have a free hand in abusing 
innocent villagers the report said

protesters at the university of the district 
of columbia said they were successful in persuading most students 
to stay away from classes monday the sixth day of a demonstration 
called to oust the schools board of directors 
administrators opened the university for the first day since 
wednesday when several hundred students barricaded themselves 
inside a campus building and refused to leave until the 11 mayoral 
appointees to the 15member board resigned 
all buildings except the one occupied by the students were 
reopened but instructors were seen conducting classes with fewer 
than 10 students each 
some students who arrived on campus monday said they showed up 
even though they were not sure whether classes would be held 
as far as we are concerned school is still closed student 
mark thompson a leader of the protest told about 500 students who 
were on campus monday morning 
trustees and students have reached agreement on nearly all of 
about 40 demands submitted by students talks have stalemated on 
the issue of the resignations with most board members refusing to 
quit 
it would not appear to be in the best interests of the 
university for them to quit udc spokesman john britton said 
we want to reiterate that the resignations are still on the 
table and it is ludicrous for them not to do what weve asked them 
to thompson said 
two trustees have agreed to resign but for personal reasons 
not because of the protest britton said 
trustee lourdes miranda submitted her resignation three weeks 
ago and trustee arthur reynolds has verbally agreed to resign he 
said 
thompson said trustee herbert o reid has agreed to quit because 
of illness but britton said the school had not received a letter 
of resignation from him 
trustee nira long has agreed to step down as board chairwoman 
but has refused to resign

an allwhite jury on monday began 
hearing the trial of a record store owner who is charged with 
selling a 2 live crew album to an undercover officer after a judge 
had ruled it obscene 
the trial is the first time the black rap groups album as 
nasty as they wanna be has faced scrutiny in criminal court 
charles freeman was arrested in his ec records store by six 
undercover broward sheriffs deputies on june 8 the arrest came 
two days after us district judge jose gonzalez said the 
miamibased groups album was obscene 
the lyrics include sexually explicit language and have been 
criticized as promoting violence against women 
using gonzalez ruling prosecutors say they have a strong case 
before broward county judge paul backman 
when you have listened to the album you will know that it 
is openly offensive to an average person leslie robson broward 
assistant state attorney told the jury in her opening statement 
if convicted of selling obscene material 31yearold freeman 
faces up to one year in jail and a 1000 fine 
freeman who is black said before the panel was chosen that he 
would be comfortable if other blacks were selected 
but he declined to comment about the jurys racial makeup after 
its selection his attorney bruce rogow who also represents 2 
live crew said the defense was surprised that of a pool of about 
35 potential jurors only one was black 
rogow said he was confident that if the defenses arguments are 
clearly presented whatever kind of jury we have will come back 
with the right answer 
the defense which will present its case after the state rests 
tuesday will argue the album does not appeal to anyones prurient 
interests and that it has literary and artistic value rogow said 
they may be strong words words that are not used in everyday 
conversation but they are spliced together into ways that are 
imaginative and creative said rogow the mistake here is to 
only hear the nasty words you have to listen to the whole 
record 
although backman refused to allow a transcript of the as nasty 
as they wanna be lyrics presented in court he did allow the 
album to be played monday 
the judge also has forbidden prosecutors from referring to 
gonzalez ruling the federal judge ruled that the album violated 
community obscenity standards in three south florida counties 
backman said that since freeman was arrested for selling the record 
to an adult prosecutors will not be allowed to discuss any 
possible impact on juveniles 
first amendment experts are monitoring the case and that of the 
2 live crew members who were arrested after performing live 
versions of the banned lyrics at a nightspot in nearby hollywood 
their trial is scheduled to begin oct 9

people were wounded monday night by gunfire from troops loyal to 
rebel christian gen michel aoun at a checkpoint at the death river 
in east beirut

lebanese forces militia was monitored in nicosia

where they fell the radio quoted the lebanese red cross as saying 
the area was full of land mines and too dangerous for ambulances at 
night 
neither aouns forces nor authorities in beirut could be 
contacted immediately for comment on the report 
the checkpoint area is less than 1 mile from the northern edge 
of christian east beirut

sen lloyd bentsen dtexas acknowledged 
monday that the home heating oil tax of 2 cents per gallon in the 
budget deal between the white house and congress was included at 
his urging to spread the pain of tax increases to the northeast 
bentsen who chairs the taxwriting senate finance committee 
said he objected to home heating oil being left out of the 
agreement just before it was struck sunday 
its a question of equity of ensuring that all regions of 
this country bear a fair share of the burden of reducing the 
federal deficit bentsen said 
residents of the south and west will have to shoulder a greater 
burden through the increase in taxes on gasoline amounting to 12 
cents per gallon eventually 2 cents from a general fuels tax and 
10 cents specifically levied on gasoline 
symbolically it is important to send a signal that the 
different regions of the united states will all carry a fair share 
of this burden bentsen said 
the inclusion of the tax was done so close to the announcement 
of the agreement by president bush on sunday that it stunned rep 
silvio conte a massachusetts republican who opposed it in the 
budget talks 
it caught senate finance committee staffers by surprise they 
told told reporters heating oil had been exempted from the fuel 
tax 
when i went into the white house it was not taxed conte 
said on sunday when i left it was taxed 
the northeast is not the only cold region of the country in 
winter by any means but it is the one where oil dominates the home 
heating market 
conte said monday he was furious at the lastminute change and 
was trying to get massachusetts gov michael s dukakis who 
selected bentsen as his vice presidential running mate in 1988 to 
lobby the texas senator he used unusually harsh language in 
criticizing bentsen 
it was real affront to his running mate mr dukakis conte 
said of bentsens move he spat at him he spat at new york gov 
mario cuomo he just better not come up to the northeast theres 
a bounty on that guy 
both conte and bentsen were participants in the budget summit 
bentsen said home heating oil was in the tax provisions saturday 
but on sunday it was gone 
when i learned sunday morning that in a midnight deal home 
heating oil had been totally exempted from any tax at all i 
protested in the strongest possible terms bentsen said 
a typical new england household used 736 gallons of home heating 
oil in the winter of 1987 the latest for which figures are 
available said tom welch of the energy information administration 
the increased tax would add 1472 to the cost of that much fuel 
oil 
in 1988 average gasoline consumption per household was 917 
gallons in the northeast 1016 gallons in the midwest and 1046 
gallons in the south and west welch said 
based on those figures the average driver in the northeast 
would pay 11004 more each year with the gasoline tax increase a 
midwest driver would pay 12192 more while one in the west or 
south would pay 12552 more 
the tax on home heating oil is expected to yield the government 
200 million over five years the gasoline tax is expected to bring 
in 45 billion in that period 
both fuels have seen sharp price runups since the aug 2 
takeover of kuwait by iraq

iraq unexpectedly postponed its speech to 
the general assembly on monday just hours after president bush 
hinted an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait could help resolve 
arabisraeli tensions 
iraqs un mission gave no explanation for rescheduling the 
address to wednesday but diplomats speculated baghdad wanted time 
to evaluate bushs message 
earlier monday iraqi ambassador abdul amir alanbari praised 
bush for saying he preferred a diplomatic outcome 
in his speech bush said iraqs unconditional withdrawal from 
kuwait could create opportunities for iraq and kuwait to settle 
their differences permanently for the states of the gulf 
themselves to build new arrangements for stability and for all the 
states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that 
divides the arabs from israel 
bush in the speech and in a later news conference did not 
elaborate on what settlements could be possible the united states 
has long been committed to a mideast settlement in which israel 
would exchange territory for arab recognition of its right to 
exist 
iraqi president saddam hussein has suggested he would pull his 
troops out if the arab dispute with israel is handled 
simultaneously on sunday saddam announced he wanted to pursue 
dialogue toward a reasonable solution and that this solution 
should be comprehensive so that we could enjoy peace 
saddam also said palestinians should be given a homeland that 
occupation armies must leave the region 
we do support any peaceful settlement of the situation or of 
the crisis said alanbari who is scheduled to give iraqs un 
speech fortunately he did mention he would prefer to have a 
peaceful diplomatic solution 
the tone of bushs remarks echoed french president francois 
mitterrands speech to open the 45th general assembly on sept 24 
if iraq were to withdraw its troops and free hostages 
everything may be possible said mitterrand 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2

tentative agreement monday hours after its contract ended and 
negotiators in washington state agreed to settle the nations 
longest strike of the school year

school board officials said was a 13 million contract

tentative agreement on a 236 million contract that would raise 
salaries 55 percent both sides said the pact was limited to one 
year because of the rocky economy

your ability to fund it doesnt seem to be wise mayor david 
dinkins said were fortunate everybody sort of understood 
that 
the raise would bring starting salaries to 26375 and senior 
salaries to 52750 the old contract covering 65000 public 
school teachers and 20000 other school employees expired at 
midnight school was in session monday 
the pact went to the united federation of teachers 3000member 
delegate assembly which voted overwhelmingly monday to recommend 
it to the full membership voting by the membership could three 
weeks 
about 80 percent of the delegates backed the new contract in a 
voice vote said union spokeswoman susan amlung 
it was a very strong vote but i dont think anyone is really 
content said amlung the feeling is that the city went as far 
as it was reasonably expected to go given the financial situation 
it was clearly a compromise 
she said the teachers had been seeking a raise of at least 8 
percent 
the new contract will cover employees of about 1000 elementary 
junior high and high schools that serve about 946000 students the 
20000 employees who are not teachers include counselors social 
workers and secretaries 
in everett wash where 460 teachers have been on strike since 
aug 30 negotiators assisted by three state mediators reached a 
tentative agreement after talking through the night said 
washington education association spokesman john cahill 
the proposal was ratified on a voice vote monday evening by 
teachers in the mukilteo school district but contract details were 
not immediately disclosed classes were set to start wednesday for 
the 9100 students 
we are especially pleased for the children its been a long 
month out of school said schools superintendent james shoemake 
classes were to have started sept 5 key issues included class 
size teacher assignment and transfer policies school 
decisionmaking panels and pay for extra time responsibility and 
incentives 
in new orleans about 3000 of the citys 4500 teachers are on 
strike which disrupted classes for 84000 students 
board president dr carl robinson said there was little else the 
financially strapped school system could do to meet the demands of 
the united teachers of new orleans and its president nat la cour 
we stepped over backwards to do what weve done and his 
response was to ask for more money robinson said 
lacour said the offer was unacceptable because it did nothing to 
raise teacher salaries this year

we just got too many phone calls too many complaints he 
said

new television sets with 13inch screens or 
larger would have to include builtin decoders for displaying 
closed captions for the deaf under a bill approved monday by the 
house and sent to president bush 
on a voice vote the house approved a measure passed by the 
senate in july requiring tv sets sold after july 1993 to be 
equipped with circuitry for converting audio portions of a tv 
program into subtitles on the screen 
decoders are available now but they sell for 160 to 200 
separately 
the house energy and commerce committee estimated that decoder 
chips could be included in sets when manufactured without adding 
more than 15 to the retail price 
for a small cost we can ensure that the promise of the 
information age is accessible to all americans said rep edward 
j markey dmass chairman of the committees telecommunications 
and finance subcommittee 
in addition to the estimated 20 million to 24 million americans 
who are deaf or hearing impaired markey said the decoders also 
would benefit millions of children and functionally illiterate 
adults in learning to read as wells as immigrants trying to learn 
english 
all primetime television shows broadcast by the three major 
networks now carry closed captions as do most national news shows 
and sports events

the president of el salvador assured president 
bush on monday that he will pursue the murder investigation of six 
jesuit priests and two others to the end a us official said 
bush met with salvadoran president alfredo cristiani during his 
string of oneonone meetings with world leaders attending a united 
nations session 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for latin american 
affairs told reporters bush noted the importance of the case for 
ussalvadoran relations and said he supported cristianis 
efforts 
the priests their housekeeper and her daughter were shot to 
death last november eight military officers have been charged with 
the crime but none has been brought to trial 
aronson quoted cristiani as saying he would push the murder 
investigation until the end 
this is the same message that cristiani has been giving members 
of congress in a lobbying effort aimed at heading off deep cuts in 
us aid 
the judge in the case according to aronsons account of 
cristianis conversation with bush is more optimistic about a 
resolution of the case since members of the military high command 
visited him to promise cooperation in the investigation 
he quoted the salvadoran leader as saying he was concerned that 
the rebels in his country were waiting to see what congress did 
about aid before agreeing to a ceasefire 
the house already has voted a 50 percent reduction in the 85 
million in annual military aid the bush administration is trying 
to keep the senate from going along 
cristiani has he would accept the cut if congress made it 
contingent on the rebels signing a ceasefire

president bush assailed iraq on monday for invading kuwait but 
hinted an iraqi withdrawal could lead to settlement of the 
arabisraeli conflict israel warned its response to an iraqi 
attack would be harsh and painful and said it was giving out 
gas masks to all citizens 
america announced it was sending two batteries of patriot 
airdefense missiles to israel to help defend against an increased 
threat from ballistic missiles in iraq 
in baghdad iraqi president saddam hussein ordered the release 
of nine french nationals believed to have been held at iraqi 
targets as shields against attack his second conciliatory gesture 
in two days 
on sunday he urged a peaceful international dialogue and 
mentioned france as a possible negotiating partner 
us french and british officials said monday they wouldnt 
talk until iraq withdrew from kuwait 
also monday irans official news agency said the foreign 
ministers of iran and saudi arabia met sunday in new york for the 
first such highlevel talks since the nations broke diplomatic ties 
2 years ago 
no progress was reported but the meeting was the most positive 
sign yet the two countries may be moving toward a rapprochement a 
reconciliation would help draw iran into the antiiraq camp and 
intensify saddams isolation 
saddam has been courting iran its war enemy from 198088 for 
help in puncturing the un economic embargo imposed after iraq 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
in other developments 
oil prices tumbled 3 per barrel to 3610 following bushs 
speech at the united nations which was seen as raising hopes of a 
diplomatic solution to the 2monthold crisis as oil fell the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials jumped 63 points to 251584 gold 
prices fell 1590 an ounce to 38660 on the new york commodity 
exchange 
saddam addressed a message to participants in a un summit on 
children telling them un sanctions are depriving iraqi children 
of milk and food a matter of deep concern and regret 
iraq denied responsiblity for a grenade attack thursday on a 
djibouti cafe in which a french child was killed french foreign 
minister roland dumas said france would retaliate if iraq was found 
responsible 
britain announced it is sending a 3500strong support force 
including a 400bed field hospital to the gulf to back up an 
armored brigade the desert rats 
in his address to the general assembly bush echoed his previous 
harsh line against iraq but tempered it with talk of a diplomatic 
solution 
iraq has plundered kuwait terrorized innocent civilians and 
held even diplomats hostage bush said 
aligning himself with remarks last week by soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze bush said iraq and its leaders must 
be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction 
a british un briefing quoted prime minister margaret thatcher 
as saying on a talk show monday you cant go in and cause all 
that damage and desolation and damage to life without 
expecting to have to pay some compensation nor can you go 
and have your soldiers do some of the things that have been done 
without expecting them to be brought before the court and be 
answerable for their terrible deeds 
in bushs demand for unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
he suggested this could lead to a resolution of the arabisraeli 
conflict 
in the aftermath of iraqs unconditional departure from 
kuwait i truly believe that there may be opportunities he said 
for iraq and kuwait to settle their differences permanently 
for the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for 
stability and for all the states and peoples of the region to 
settle the conflict that divides the arabs from israel 
the bush administration has rejected saddams attempts to link 
his pullout from kuwait with a simultaneous israeli pullout from 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
bush who has praised the united nations for its handling of the 
crisis also promised to pay the 5219 million in us arrears to 
the un budget 
shevardnadze called bushs speech brilliant iraqs 
ambassador said his government disagreed with everything but 
took positive note of bushs mentioning a desire for a peaceful 
solution 
a spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said he 
did not see bushs speech as linking the gulf crisis to israels 
conflict with the arabs 
i dont think that is a linkage avi pazner said he said 
similar things before 
the israeli army announced it will begin distributing gas masks 
next week to all its 47 million citizens including jews and 
israeli arabs 
saddam has repeatedly threatened to attack israel at one time 
threatening to burn half the jewish state with chemical weapons 
officials said the distribution plan was developed long before 
the gulf crisis 
the 140000 arabs living in annexed east jerusalem will be 
issued gas masks the government said the 17 million palestinians 
of the west bank and gaza will have to pay the purchase price of 
100plus per kit because they are not covered by israeli national 
insurance 
each kit contains a gas mask a syringe with a nerve gas 
antidote and purifying powder instructions will be in hebrew 
arabic english and russian 
gas masks will be available for tourists at hotels officials 
said 
at the united nations israeli foreign minister david levy said 
israel will know how to defend itself if attacked and its 
response will be harsh and painful 
egyptian president hosni mubarak was quoted as saying on the 
french la cinq television network on monday that saddam has had 
secret contacts with israel during the gulf crisis israel denied 
it

disabled activists barricaded themselves in the 
presidents office at morehouse college on monday to try to force a 
meeting with health and human services secretary louis sullivan a 
former dean at the college 
more than a dozen demonstrators in wheelchairs rolled into 
morehouse president leroy keiths office before noon monday 
scores of additional protesters followed blocking the front 
door and hallways and chanting we want sullivan and we 
shall overcome 
keith left by a rear door 
the protesters belonged to americans disabled for attendant 
programs today or adapt a national advocacy group for the 
disabled 
the groups members were angered that sullivan a former dean of 
the morehouse school of medicine did not respond to an invitation 
to meet with them but agreed to speak at a recent aids symposium in 
san francisco 
this group invited him to speak on an issue as serious as 
aids he chose to ignore the issue said michael auberger 
cofounder of adapt 
at least 50 demonstrators said they planned to remain in the 
presidents office overnight 
morehouse officials told the protesters that sullivan had 
refused to meet them 
he will not meet with you under these circumstances by 
holding an institution hostage said richard ammons vice 
president of development 
the protesters said they came to georgia because the state is 
one of the worst at caring for its disabled citizens 
georgia and 12 other states do not provide statefunded care for 
disabled people outside of nursing homes said mark johnson 
spokesman for the georgia branch of adapt 
protesters also complained that many operators of nursing homes 
for the disabled have nothing more than a business license 
the nursing home lobby is real strong in georgia and that is 
who the decision makers are listening to right now johnson said 
institutions are being rewarded for bad work and the people who 
need help are not getting it

japan to consider what it can do to cooperate fully with the un

action 
we have heard that when we cooperate with the united nations 
we should not limit ourselves to simply putting up money but should 
should toil together with others that is my feeling as well

the supreme court said monday it will use a 
dispute growing out of a settled strike by continental air lines 
pilots to set new guidelines on unions duties to represent their 
members 
the court will consider killing a lawsuit against the air line 
pilots association by striking pilots who said their union denied 
them fair representation 
the bush administration had urged the justices to hear the case 
uncertainty regarding the extent to which settlements will 
expose unions to liability for a breach of the duty of fair 
representation can only complicate the efforts of management 
unions and federal mediators to achieve negotiated resolutions of 
those disputes government lawyers told the court 
a strike against continental that began in october 1983 ended 
two years later in the interim more than 1600 pilots either 
stayed on the job or were hired to replace the strikers who 
numbered about 1000 
the pilots union agreed to a settlement that let striking pilots 
return to work on terms considerably less favorable than pilots who 
flew for continental during the strike 
striking pilots sued in federal court accusing the union of 
violating the federal railway labor act that governs employment for 
railroads and airlines 
a federal appeals court said the case should go to trial to 
determine whether the settlement was arbitary and a breach of the 
unions duty to represent its members 
continental filed for bankruptcy protection in 1983 and has 
undergone an extensive financial reorganization

air force gen curtis e 
lemay who relayed the order to drop the abomb on japan and said 
the united states should threaten to bomb north vietnam back into 
the stone age died monday he was 83 
lemay who also directed the 1948 berlin airlift and ran for 
vice president in 1968 as george wallaces running mate died of a 
heart attack at the 22nd strategic hospital said sgt steve 
mahnke 
an ambulance had picked him up minutes earlier at his retirement 
home outside this base east of los angeles 
he was one of the real american heroes of world war ii 
wallace said i am proud to have served under him in world war ii 
and proud to have had him on the ticket as a vice presidential 
candidate in my thirdparty campaign i will always count it a 
high honor to have been his personal friend 
the former fourstar general who built the strategic air command 
into a global strike force 
considered the father of strategic bombing lemay and his 
tactics were instrumental in pressing the daylight bombing 
offensive against the nazis in europe in world war ii 
lemay was the architect of b17 bombing formation tactics in 
europe and later transferred to the pacific where he organized the 
b29 bombing campaign against the japanese islands 
years later he said the nuclear bombings of hiroshima and 
nagasaki were unnecessary to force japans surrender 
we felt that our incendiary bombings had been so successful 
that japan would collapse before we invaded lemay said in a 1985 
interview with the omaha neb worldherald 
we went ahead and droppped the bombs because president harry 
truman told me to do it he told me in a personal letter 
but lemay told the newspaper he felt the united states could 
have defeated japan in a few more days if it had continued the 
firebombing of japanese cities 
after the war lemay was given command of the us air force in 
europe he was there in 1948 when the soviet union cut off ground 
access to west berlin his management of the airlift that kept west 
berlin supplied brought lemay much notice at home 
he was named commanding general of the strategic air command in 
october 1948 and held the command until june 1957 longer than any 
other general 
the 1955 jimmy stewart movie strategic air command 
provided a glimpse of the strike force lemay built a 
cigarchomping frank lovejoy portrayed a character that displayed 
lemays tough demanding persona 
he was sacs second commander but was widely credited with 
having built its bomber force to a formidable level 
within a few short years he transformed the largely demobilized 
air arm into a global striking force that could deliver nuclear 
weapons anywhere at any time 
in a 1965 biography mission with lemay published in 1965 
after his retirement as air force chief of staff during the early 
years of the vietnam war h wrote that a solution to the war might 
be to warn the north vietnamese that they have got to draw in 
their horns and stop their aggression or we are going to bomb them 
back into the stone age 
his reputation was that of a man who was equally unsparing of 
his men and himself he said he was unable to distinguish between 
the unfortunate and the incompetent and he tolerated little if any 
error from his subordinates 
but he would willingly do any job that he demanded of his 
followers he was as comfortable in a machine gun cupola as he was 
in the cockpit he personally led dozens of missions in europe 
one of many famous stories about lemay was that he once found a 
sac sentry who had put down his weapon to eat a sandwich 
this afternoon i found a man guarding a hangar with a ham 
sandwich there will be no more of that lemays subsequent memo 
said 
he was promoted to full general while at sac 
after leaving sac lemay became vice chief then president 
kennedy named him chief of staff of the air force 
lemay retired in 1965 frustrated by the politics of the 
pentagon and by robert s mcnamara defense secretary under 
presidents kennedy and johnson 
mcnamara had denied lemay the b70 which the general had wanted 
as the successor to the b52 and forced him to accept the f111 
fighterbomber in so doing mcnamara had subordinated lemays 
coveted bombers to the new ballistic missiles 
lemay also grew angry over mcnamaras restraints on us air 
power in vietnam a sore point for lemay who believed in an allout 
war 
at a news conference at which he was introduced as wallaces 
running mate lemay said he saw nothing wrong with using nuclear 
weapons to shorten any war and thus save lives 
lemay had been living in air force village west a military 
retirement community outside march 
a memorial service is scheduled for wednesday at the air base 
chapel burial will be at the us air force academy on thursday 
he is survived by his wife helen and a daughter

fletchers 1984 bid for reelection failed after the articles 
were published the articles reported that five agency officials 
said fletcher tried to steer a 16 million contract to an 
insulation business in which he became a partner 
the articles quoted the agencys executive director as saying 
fletcher once offered him and his wife a trip to hawaii which the 
agency official interpreted as a bribe 
a jury in 1986 awarded fletcher 250000 in general damages 
25000 in special damages and 735000 in punitive damages 
but the trial judge threw out the award ruling fletcher had 
failed to prove the articles were published with actual malice a 
burden facing any public official who sues for libel 
a state appeals court upheld the dismissal of the award and the 
california supreme court refused to hear fletchers appeal last 
february 
in its 1989 ruling the appeals court said the evidence 
suggests a sincere attempt to report what the mercury news viewed 
as unethical behavior on the part of a san jose public official 
it added clearly the articles contained factual errors but 
was there clear and convincing evidence that the papers reporter 
did not believe his story was true we do not think so

the supreme court refused oct 1 to let the 
st louis postdispatch see some confidential documents in the 
governments corruption investigation of pentagon contracts 
the court over two dissenting votes let stand a ruling that 
the privacy rights of mcdonnell douglas corp the nations largest 
defense contractor and some of its employees outweigh the publics 
right to know more about the weapons procurement case 
justices byron r white and harry a blackmun voted to hear 
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such 
review 
the justice department investigation called operation ill 
wind began in 1987 and has yielded more than three dozen guilty 
pleas or convictions on fraud and briberyrelated charges 
among the contractors investigated was mcdonnell douglas which 
is based in the st louis area and receives some 9 billion a year 
in pentagon contracts 
the fbi in 1988 conducted a search of defense contractor 
offices including those of mcdonnell douglas and its vice 
president thomas gunn search warrants were based on information 
the fbi obtained listening to wiretapped telephone conversations 
the postdispatch asked to see sealed documents related to the 
warrants particularly government affidavits that might reveal what 
was learned by listening to the wiretaps 
the justice department initially opposed making the documents 
public but substantially dropped its opposition in december 1988 
the government now siding with the newspaper said it no longer 
had a compelling interest in keeping portions of the material 
secret since it had concluded part of the investigation 
but mcdonnell douglas gunn and five unidentified employees 
continued to oppose disclosure 
a federal judge ordered parts of the documents unsealed but the 
ruling was reversed in february by the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals 
the appeals court said the absence of an indictment against the 
company and its employees weighs heavily in favor of the privacy 
interests and nondisclosure 
these search warrant affidavits implicate some individuals 
directly in criminal misconduct others only indirectly the 
appeals court said disclosure could seriously damage their 
reputations and careers

the supreme court on oct 1 refused to kill a 
libel lawsuit stemming from advertisements comparing blue cross and 
blue shield services to those of a health industry competitor 
the court without comment left intt could send 
us healthcares libel allegations against blue cross and blue 
shield to a federal jury in philadelphia 
at issue was whethact a ruling thaer some libel cases involving commercial 
speech could be held to less stringent standards than others 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in reviving healthcares 
suit last march relaxed the rules for commercialspeech libel 
cases 
since 1964 public figures including most businesses suing 
for libel must prove that the suedover statements are false and 
were made with actual malice knowledge or reckless disregard 
of falsity 
private citizens suing for libel face a far less demanding 
burden having to prove only that the statements are false and were 
made negligently 
in ruling on healthcares lawsuit the 3rd circuit court said 
the more stringent actual malice standard need not be arise over what 
the agency is entitled to censor

1976 working either in vietnam or on vietnam matters at cia 
headquarters in langley va

book was a breach of his employment contract with the cia and 
ordered that he forfeit all proceeds from the book to the agency 
the high court also ruled the cia could continue to require 
snepp to submit any agencyrelated writings for prepublication

killers and to a pattern of apparent racism 
odessa police said they were aware of the threats

had angered some in the community 
mr bissinger has every reason to think he might face an 
unpleasant situation if he came im not sure that it would be 
lifethreatening but i think he made a good call she said 
she said people were angry because they felt the book had a 
significant impact in a decision made last week to bar permian from

university interscholastic league which regulates high school 
sports and other extracurricular activities in the states public

reporters cant be jailed for refusing to 
provide notes photos or news sources to people who sue one another 
based on an eventthe reporter covered the state supreme court 
ruled sept 27 
californias press shield law which forbids holding reporters 
in contempt for withholding confidential sources or unpublished 
material provides ironclad protection in civil cases the court 
said in a unanimous decision 
the shield law was made part of the state constitution by the 
voters in 1980 in response to the jailing of several reporters for 
refusing to reveal their sources 
the court ruled in may that in criminal cases reporters can be 
required to testify or provide evidence if necessary to protect a 
defendants constitutional right to a fair trial but the justices 
ruled sept 27 that parties to a civil suit have no similar 
constitutional right that can overcome the shield law 
this is a complete victory for the journalists and the 
public said c michael cooney lawyer for new york times co 
publisher of the santa barbara newspress the case arose when an 
automobile company sued in a 1984 accident sought a newspress 
photographers pictures of the crash 
michael zuk lawyer for the company volkswagen of america said 
the ruling would deny my client access to what may be critical 
evidence in civil litigation the voters who passed the shield 
law did not intend to foreclose any evidence held by reporters that 
could be essential to a civil suit he argued 
the rulings main impact is on civil suits that do not directly 
involve the news media in which evidence is sought from a 
reporter if the reporter cannot be held in contempt of court and 
jailed until he or she testifies there is little a judge or a 
party to a suit can do to compel the testimony 
the opinion by justice david eagleson said the party seeking the 
evidence could sue the reporter under a law providing a 500 
penalty plus actual damages caused by a witness refusal to provide 
evidence but eagleson said the law was rarely used and would be 
virtually ineffectual in compelling testimony 
in a case that has a news organization as a party such as a 
libel suit the ruling has a lesser impact because judges can take 
other steps against parties who withhold evidence such as deciding 
the case in the opponents favor

backers of legislation to reregulate cable 
television prices and services say theyll be back next year with 
an even tougher bill following a defeat in the senate 
on sept 28 sen timothy wirth dcolo objected to bringing 
the bill to the floor for debate or a vote where it was expected 
to pass easily faced with a possible filibuster a sponsor of the 
bill sen daniel inouye dhawaii declared the measure dead and 
buried for the 101st congress 
congress is expected to adjourn as early as the middle of 
october 
backers of the bill said that the cable industrys victory might 
be shortlived and that it would only strengthen the hand of 
wouldbe competitors 
home satellite companies are itching to compete with cable and 
are expected to push provisions of the senate bill that would 
guarantee them access to cable programming broadcasters also want 
cable to pay for the programming it now takes virtually for free 
there may come a time when the cable industry will devoutly 
wish they had taken todays deal said edward o fritts 
president of the national association of broadcasters 
the office of management and budget had issued a veto warning on 
the bill which would have restored some of the government 
oversight of cable that congress lifted in 1984 
omb said that the bill imposed too many restrictions on cable 
and that increased competition perhaps from the telephone 
industry was the answer to any problems in the cable industry

theres a lot of babble about unconventional tv 
shows nowadays mainly by people who talk about but dont watch 
twin peaks but there are some truly unconventional shows 
about 
case in point abcs veteran tuesday series about high school 
life head of the class which began its fifth season last 
month its wellcrafted literate and even funny 
this cant be said of the newer high school sitcoms nbcs 
ferris bueller and foxs parker lewis cant lose theyre 
so conventional that the students are smarter than their teachers 
and high school principals 
abcs class on the other hand is set in an honors program 
class its students are there to learn and as in the earlier era 
of abcs longrunning welcome back kotter the teacher knows 
more than they do 
if you havent yet seen this seasons class you might take 
a look tonight because it has yet another unconventional touch a 
new history teacher from scotland played by comedian billy 
connolly 
connolly who even is from scotland brings a wonderful warmth 
and exuberance to the show 
full of good will with a musical lilt to his voice he belies 
the rumor that all scots are dour the rumor started in 1746 after 
the scots and the english had a frank exchange of views at a place 
called culloden 
as oxfordeducated billy macgregor connolly succeeds howard 
hesseman who played the original more laidback teacher charlie 
moore but left to pursue various nonseries projects 
in the class premiere moores departure was explained as a 
sudden exit to take a shot at acting as one student jokingly put 
it he left to be in a lowbudget musical seven brides for one 
brother 
there is some resentment of the newcomer with the strange accent 
and obvious eyes for the lovely vice principal jeannetta arnett 
most of the resentment is by dennis dan schneider the rotund 
chemistry whiz who berates the class nerd arvid dan frischman 
for taking such an immediate liking to the new teacher 
but its hard not to like a guy who not only knows his history 
but also describes the first westward rush of east germans after 
the berlin wall came down as a tangled wave of bad denim 
in tonights episode connolly who greets his young charges 
each morning with a cheery good morning geniuses has to cope 
with the impact of a flu epidemic on a citywide high school 
shakespeare competition 
there might not be an epidemic at his school were it not for 
arvid obsessed with maintaining a perfect attendance record he 
insists on coming to class even tough hes so stricken by flu he 
faints at the start of the show 
this prompts macgregor to tell him you look like something 
the cat dragged in changed its mind dragged back out again came 
back in threw up went back out dragged it farther away and 
diiiiiiiied 
its not said meanly though but in the caring tradition and 
gentle humor of yesteryears kotter who like macgregor taught in 
a new york school albeit to a class that was er of a lower iq 
there also are nice bits of byplay in class between the 
lovely vice principal and the new teacher as when he agrees to 
help out in the fluravaged shakespeare competition 
assuming a shakespearean look he intones i would sooner mine 
eyes be plucked from my head than deny thy lips request 
she smiles sweetly thats beautiful but its not 
shakespeare 
yep this is unconventional television dont know if itll 
survive why the kids dont even say surfs up 
but take a look at this class tonight you may enroll in it 
 
elsewhere in television 
on the frontline of global dumping public tvs frontline 
starts its ninth season tonight with a 60minute report by 
frontline visitor bill moyers on the international export of 
toxic waste from the united states entitled global dumping 
ground its a collaboration by moyers the center for 
investigative reporting and san francisco public tv station kqed

the united states lost its financial bearings in 
the late 1970s and 1980s not slowly but in a rush as if 
institutions that once locked pennies away suddenly sought to force 
millions on borrowers 
billions of dollars were sent abroad to earn the high interest 
rates that less developed nations were willing to pay while some 
of the same banks were turning down american homebuyers seeking 
mortgages 
the money people claimed to know what they were doing too that 
as bankers they could tell a good customer from a bad one they 
were warned that loans to less developed countries could turn bad 
nonsense said many wellknown bankers 
individuals saw the phenomenon in the form of letters urging 
them to accept bank cards with builtin lines of credit a 
surprising turn they mused since the same bank wouldnt have 
given them a dime a year or so before 
and as we are reminded again and again in these days of big 
debt budget deficits rising taxes bankuptcies high interest 
rates and recessionlike economic activity the people of the 1990s 
will pay for it 
in a discussion on corporate takeovers earlier this year 
william m kearns jr managing director of shearson lehman 
brothers graphically compared the old days with the new in a way 
that few in his audience could forget 
back in the late 60s and early 70s he said if wall street 
was going to do a hundredmillion dollar bond offering for 
somebody like exxon they would inspect all that companys 
properties that was just the beginning 
then representatives from all the major underwriting firms 
first boston salomon brothers goldman sachs would sit down 
and talk with exxons ceo cfo chief executive and chief financial 
officer and other officers 
youd go through a cia duediligence study of a triplea 
credit in order to float a hundredmilliondollar offering all 
this for a relatively small loan to one of the most financially 
secure companies in the world 
then we hit 86 or 87 a guy youve never seen walks into 
your building and says ive got a million bucks can you lend me 
onehundredmillion dollars and wall street would say sure 
step right over here 
simon business the magazine of the university of rochesters 
graduate school of business administration named for william e 
simon former treasury secretary recently published some of 
kearns remarks revealing the extent to which standards were 
lowered 
referring to the easy money prof gregg jarrell asked him so 
the door was opened to corporate raiders 
kearns responded yes to blackhat guys who never should 
have been financed by wall street 
in those days you didnt need a lot of money to buy a major 
asset accessibility to money increased either through banks or 
through junk bonds people were putting up 2 percent and borrowing 
98 per cent 
in a typical deal said kearns you could put up 10 percent in 
equity obtain secure debt financing on 50 percent to 60 percent 
and then for the balance offer unsecured subordinated call it 
thirdrate debt to investors 
thats the mentality and morality that led to savings and loan 
disasters the downfall of securities firms a bear market and the 
shaky structure of many banks it probably has led also to the 
recession of 1990

editors note americas military service academies have a 
reputation for accepting only the top students with thousands of 
applicants rejected each year but theres a way for students with 
mediocre grades to join the cadet corps especially if they are 
minorities or good athletes almost one in five of todays cadets 
are graduates of special prep schools 
</TEXT>

eric ver hage by his own admission was a 
lousy high school student and a troublemaker who earned almost 
ridiculously low grades 
he finished near the bottom of his class of 310 at 
mechanicsburg pa and didnt have enough credits to graduate 
six years later ver hage is entering his senior year at the 
us naval academy where he ranks in the top third of his class 
a change of heart and a lot of hard work helped ver hage make 
the transformation from high school goofoff to successful scholar 
so did a 40000 oneyear prep school education financed by 
taxpayers 
ver hage like generations of naval officers before him is a 
graduate of the 75yearold naval academy preparatory school naps 
in newport ri it is run by the navy solely to qualify students 
for the naval academy and the coast guard academy 
the army and air force have similar schools that serve as feeder 
schools for their academies 
the armed forces spend more than 20 million annually to prepare 
about 800 young men and women for the service academies while each 
year the academies turn away hundreds of qualified applicants in 
fact prep school graduates make up about 15 percent to 20 percent 
of the cadet corps 
we wirebrush them get them all shined up get the brass 
looking good and then we deliver them says capt thomas p 
danaher director of the navy prep school 
generally the prep schools have gone about their business with 
little interference from the outside but now congress has asked 
the general accounting office to look at the three schools and 
submit a report next year 
congress just wants to know if the schools are doing their job 
well and if the money is being well spent says james schweiter 
a staff aide with the house armed services committee 
some prep school students such as ver hage are late bloomers 
seeking a second chance others are minorities whose grades and 
test scores are too low 
still others are athletes recruited to play sports 
schweiter says some members of the committee have questioned 
whether prep schools are improperly used to groom intercollegiate 
athletes the gao study may answer that question he says 
the navy prep school the oldest of the three began in 1915 
with 13 enlisted men as students 
it was a very small school to provide a commissioning path for 
enlisted men says john w renard dean of admissions at the 
academy 
the original mission of the schools was to help men and women 
from the regular army air force and navy enter the academies but 
the role has been expanded in recent years to help athletes and 
minorities qualify for the academies 
prep schools also offer a way into the academies for students 
who do not follow the normal admission route a nomination from a 
member of congress 
despite the cost there is no talk at the academies of cutting 
back or eliminating the prep schools even in a time of tight money 
and dwindling military budgets 
the academies are not short on applicants 
at the naval academy more than 12000 applied for admission 
this year more than 2000 of them qualified scholastically 
medically and physically for the 1232 openings in the class of 
1994 
renard acknowledges he could easily fill the class each year 
without the prep school 
but would i want to the answer is no he says 
students at prep schools may have had shaky academic records in 
high school but they are bright and often have the motivation and 
leadership qualities that produce the best officers renard says 
officials at all three schools emphasize the importance of the 
prep schools to their efforts to enroll minorities they say prep 
school graduates add a diversity that would not exist if the 
academies restricted enrollment to the top scholars 
the air force academy just couldnt meet our minority 
recruiting goals without the prep school says col james wright 
head of the air force academy preparatory school at colorado 
springs colo 
if you close the prep school you eliminate a source of entry 
to west pointfor soldiers for minorities for some females who 
wouldnt otherwise have a chance to go says col jim orahood 
commandant of the us military preparatory school at fort 
monmouth nj

you need all these segments of society he says 
minorities dont come from the best schools as a group we do 
want to keep them in the mainstream of our military and often this 
is the best way for them to get in 
orahood is a walking advertisement for the military academy 
preparatory school the west point graduate returned to fort 
monmouth as its commanding officer 26 years after he graduated from 
the prep school 
i came from one of those small high schools he says 
there were 20something in my class i didnt know what a slide 
rule was i didnt know calculus 
the prep schools say their graduates often go on to become medal 
winners war heroes and topechelon officers 
astronaut loren shriver is a graduate of the air force prep 
school so is graham shirley who flew 200 combat missions in 
vietnam and rose to the rank of brigadier general 
the naval academy prep school numbers among its graduates vice 
adm joseph metcalf now retired who commanded us forces during 
the invasion of granada and vice adm frank donavan currently 
commander of the military sealift command 
all three academies use the prep schools to boost their athletic 
programs 
we would not be able to field the athletic teams that we do 
without prep school wright says 
we need every little edge we can get because of the high 
academic standards at the academy says jack lengyel navys 
athletic director 
if an athlete meets normal admission standards but the 
academics are shaky then we will offer the athlete the prep 
school renard said 
that was the case with john casey a junior from doylestown pa 
he was asked to go to prep school when he was recruited to row on 
navys crew team 
that was fine with me he says i figured that would give 
me a good background for my military training and boost my 
academics 
mark smith a wrestler from holt mich went the prep school 
route because he made a lastminute decision to attend the naval 
academy instead of michigan state 
i called the academy and they said they were interested 
smith says they said they could get me into naps on short 
notice it was a great avenue for me 
by accepting appointment to the prep school students commit 
themselves to military service whether they go on to the service 
academy or not 
if they pass the course they are virtually guaranteed 
appointment to one of the academies 
if they dont pass they become part of the regular military 
service as enlisted personnel 
all prep school students take the same basic course two units 
of math one of english and one of science students also begin 
military training 
those who go on to an academy graduate at about the same rate as 
those who enter directly from high school or college 
prep schools say their graduates tend to stay in the military 
longer than other academy students 
a study by the army showed retention rates higher by 5 percent 
to 10 percent at key landmarks such as five years when academy 
graduates can first leave the service and 20 years the first 
retirement mark 
prep schools require applicants to commit an extra year of their 
young lives to the military 
my brother had gone that route he recommended it says 
chris oddo a junior at the naval academy 
i dont think i had the grades to get in here first i dont 
think i could have made it here without a year at naps 
ver hage says he did poorly in high school because i was 
lazy 
now i am the complete opposite he says i dont want to 
miss anything again because im lazy 
academically i learned an incredible amount at naps naps was 
my foot in the door

editors note whats more important to a movie the story or 
the star the men and women behind the scenes who write words that 
actors mouth have been grossly underpaid compared with the people 
in front of the camera but that is changing now with major 
studios shelling out millions of dollars for scripts

actor michael douglas wants 10 million a 
picture tom cruise commands just a little less arnold 
schwarzenegger collects as much as 12 million per film joe 
eszterhas recently got 3 million 
joe who 
the screenwriter 
a handful of working movie writers whose median annual pay 
floats around 39000 are starting to draw spectacular salaries 
with several scripts selling for 1 million and more 
its wonderful to have paul newman in a movie but if he 
doesnt have great words he cant improvise them says ray 
gideon who wrote 1984s starman with partner bruce evans for 
the thenunheardof sum of 300000 
the movie studios still fawn more lavishly over actors and even 
director renny harlin die hard 2 gets 3 million a picture 
although screenwriters are perhaps the most important ingredient 
in a films recipe their compensation continues to be far from 
commensurate 
the writers guild of america says salaries across the board are 
growing all the same many cant make a living at the craft half 
of the wgas 7500 members have no writing income at all some 
years 
writers are really starting to catch up but they still are a 
long way behind says a leading hollywood deal maker 
thats the case even though star power doesnt necessarily 
guarantee packed houses as this past summer proved 
the seasons biggest hit didnt have milliondollar names such 
as tom cruise eddie murphy arnold schwarzenegger and bruce 
willis the runaway smash was anchored by a strong script and for 
that reason long lines materialized for writer bruce joel rubins 
ghost 
in the end story is what people want rubin says 
most of the precious screenplay sales these days are for 
socalled spec scripts written on speculation of sale not on 
an assignment from a producer or studio 
in frantic bidding wars these scripts and sometimes book 
manuscripts when no screenplay is yet penned are auctioned off 
to the studios and major independent producers 
even the walt disney co the stingiest studio paid out 1 
million in a deal for the ultimatum and one other script from 
its writers and 1 million for hell bentand back by doug 
richardson and rick jaffa 
selling spec scripts isnt a new way of doing business preston 
sturges sold 1933s the power and the glory on spec and william 
goldman wrote 1969s butch cassidy and the sundance kid with no 
guarantee of income the new twist is the price 
veteran writers with strong track records on assignment earn 
around 200000 with another 200000 or so paid if the movie is 
made for the spec gamble the stakes grow logarithmically 
this april shane black sold his script for the action movie 
the last boy scout to music mogul david geffen for 175 
million black had a better offer 225 million from carolco 
pictures but chose geffen because he preferred geffens producer 
joel silver 
previously black earned 250000 for writing lethal weapon 
a fascinating account of instant hollywood riches comes from 
brian helgeland and manny coto talking on the telephone not long 
ago the two jokingly decided not to hang up until they concocted a 
1 million script idea 
with their script completed the agent for coto and helgeland 
mailed on a thursday ticking clocks to 20 industry executives with 
the warning the ticking man is coming the script for the 
pairs the ticking man a story of a nuketoting android was 
sent out the next tuesday morning it sold that night for 1 
million 
in these bidding wars some scripts age like vintage wines 
laurence dworet and robert roy pool wrote a script for the 
ultimatum in 1980 but couldnt sell it for a decade their 
patience had a good price the 1 million disney deal 
so warm is the script fever that some screenwriters without 
recent hits or even any real credits are selling spec scripts 
for astounding sums joe eszterhas a former journalist sold 
basic instinct for 3 million even though his latest movies 
betrayed and music box generated only moderate boxoffice 
business 
it was ready to go into principal photography more or less 
thomas levine a spokesman for cexplaining the 
extraordinary basic instinct purchase price the total costarolco 
said in 
for the film will be staggering star michael douglas will be paid 
more than 10 million and director paul verhoeven will earn as much 
as eszterhas

among them was bechler until then a loyal soldier and a loyal 
nazi but he changed sides while a prisoner he said later because 
of the traumatic experience at stalingrad where hitler had ordered 
the outgunned outmanned 6th army to fight to the last man 
bechler joined the moscowbased national committee for free 
germany comprising communists and disillusioned german officers 
that sought to demoralize the wehrmacht news of his defection was 
broadcast by soviet propaganda stations 
the communist underground in germany focused on his wife in the 
hope of gaining an ally she received hundreds of anonymous letters 
denouncing the hitler regime and was called on by mysterious 
visitors 
knowing him i did not believe them when they told me that my 
husband had changed sides she recalls i thought this was a 
provocation that could endanger my family i thought above all of 
my two children 
under the nazi wartime rule even close relatives of people 
found guilty of antistate activities risked being sent to a 
concentration camp 
to ward off any suspicion of being a communist sympathizer she 
handed the letters to police who placed her home under 
surveillance when another uninvited visitor arrived he was 
arrested and executed in 1944 
like many others of my generation i grew up with this kind of 
patriotism that seems inextricably linked with thinking in terms of 
black or white enemy or friend explained the silverhaired 
author now 76 
the nazis sentenced her husband to death in absentia for high 
treason when word of his defection passed through wehrmacht 
channels the local commander urged her to divorce him she 
stubbornly refused it meant ostracism for her and her children 
reduced food rations exclusion from public schools and other 
sanctions 
bernhard bechler returned to germany with the victorious red 
army before his wife was arrested in june 1945 and charged with 
murder in the execution of her communist visitor 
bechler told friends later he gave up an attempt to locate his 
wife after he was told that she was a prisoner of the soviets 
their two children whom she had left with friends got a new 
mother with his second wife 
for margret bechler the arrest meant 11 agonizing years in 
seven prisons she was among the last inmates of buchenwald the 
former nazi concentration camp used by the soviets for another 
five years mass graves recently discovered in east germany suggest 
that thousands failed to survive sovietrun internment camps 
in 1950 she was turned over to east german jurisdiction and 
sentenced to death as being responsible for the wartime execution 
of her communist visitor only six of the 32 prisoners convicted 
then for alleged war crimes escaped execution including ms 
bechler the only woman in the group 
she was released in 1956 and moved to the west she became a 
teacher so i could be with children again after i had lost my 
own among those helping her was her husbands brother a highly 
decorated former wehrmacht general turned preacher in west germany 
her husband had long severed all links with his family 
including his brother through a friend ms bechler obtained the 
east german address of her son who also had become a teacher a 
letter she wrote was sent back with a curt note that drove her to 
sheer despair she recalls 
we have the best possible mother since 1945 said the 
typewritten note signed by her son hansbernhard and daughter 
adelheid it added ominously that competent authorities would 
be alerted in case of further molestation by you 
you will realize that we were forced to sign this letter 
her son told her after their reunion 
her son has already visited her three times in west germany and 
she has visited him and his family north of berlin he also keeps 
in touch with his sickly father 
thats a good thing ms bechler says i dont want him to 
lose his father because he found his mother

editors note the motor city motown detroit was a legend of 
the manufacturing world a beehive that spawned wealthy suburbs 
such as bloomfield hills and grosse pointe but today its decrepit 
center decays under the blows of poverty and crime yet there is 
fight left in this great lakes city which may become the free 
trade link to canada

at least a third of this citys population has 
left since 1960 and a third of those who remain are on welfare 
there is bad news everywhere the percapita homicide rate is 
among the nations highest 60 per 100000 people in 1989 in the 
last decade it has had the biggest population loss of all the 
nations top 15 cities 
a federal grand jury is probing the police forces use of a 
secret fund the debthaunted school systems students test below 
the national average 
adding insult to injury the motor city and its suburbs lost 43 
percent of their auto dealers in the past 11 years down from 51 to 
29 including the suburbs of highland park and hamtramck 
some experts say that detroit a 70percent black island 
surrounded by mostly white suburbs now faces the flight of 
middleclass blacks 
that defection is partly blamed for a preliminary 1990 census 
count showing the citys population about 30000 people below 1 
million costing detroit money prestige and a congressional seat 
there has been a steady decline from a population of 167 
million in 1960 to 151 million in 1970 to 12 million in 1980 
the city considered the countrys sixthlargest until last 
year would drop to ninth if the contested 1990 count stands 
detroit is the quintessential big industrial northeast and 
midwest city says mark neithercut of the michigan metropolitan 
information center 
it is clearly in decline he says the same thing is 
happening in baltimore but its greater here 
wilbur rich a political scientist at detroits wayne state 
university and the author of a biography on fiveterm mayor coleman 
young says the flight is a double tragedy 
why detroit it had so much going for it rich says it 
was one of the few places where a black could make a decent wage 
buy a house that wasnt attached living in detroit meant success 
we dont attract people anymore people get on a bus now to 
leave 
not all detroiters are packing up some perhaps personified by 
the 4ton outstretched bronze fist of boxer joe louis that graces 
the median along jefferson avenue downtown are fighting back 
i think detroit has reached its lowest number of population 
itll start to come back says paul hubbard president of new 
detroit inc an advocacy and communityaction group founded after 
riots in 1967 left 43 dead 
detroit has what suburbs need workers a water system and 
recent tony waterfront housing developments they are luring 
people back which may in turn draw back businesses he says 
the new uscanadian freetrade pact could make detroit the 
midwests major port he says if we take advantage of it were 
headed in the right direction 
new detroit is pushing free trade which could be its biggest 
success hubbard says to date major triumphs include breaking up 
gangs that sprang up in the 1970s and nurturing more than 100 
citizens groups that fix up neighborhoods or drive out the drug 
dealers who lurk in detroits thousands of abandoned houses 
theres been a resurgence of community groups rebuilding 
neighborhoods in the past three years says david dasher of the 
nonprofit michigan avenue community organization founded in 1975 
to battle blight it renovated and resold 22 homes in the past 
three years trying for a 10percent profit to plow into the next 
project 
his groups westside neighborhood is holding its own which 
is no small accomplishment as long as people care theres a 
chance 
mayor young thinks the most pressing need is jobs to counter 
detroits high unemployment rate hubbard and rich believe a better 
school system is essential 
were putting more emphasis on preschool to break that welfare 
cycle hubbard says thats what the school system has to do i 
dont think they understood that until recently 
the 262school 172000student system was so indebted that the 
state considered taking over last year to balance its budget bond 
issues approved by voters last fall eased that while making city 
residents total tax bill the highest of any michigan city

before the referendum passed comedian jay leno on national 
television poked fun at the systems 1 million 
howtobemorefrugal study until 1988 school board members were 
driven to meetings by chauffeurs 
it isnt just money an april attendance report showed that only 
21 schools had 90 percent to 94 percent attendance each day a 
dress code took effect this fall a measure to curb violence such 
as the shooting of an osborn high school student over his 135 
jacket and the slaying of a kettering high school student who was 
stripped of his coat and 70 sneakers 
mayoral spokesman bob berg says racism is part of the citys 
trouble the citys about 70 percent black the suburbs are 
white he says 
there are people who brag about not coming downtown in years 
they say its not racial but it is 
detroits black population soared from 289 percent to 631 
percent between 1960 and 1980 census data shows detroits 1980 
black population was the largest among the nations 10 major 
cities 
the racial divide between detroit and its suburbs is deepening 
as it is in chicago baltimore and gary ind according to the 
university of michigans 38th detroit area study its most recent 
the social segregation is astonishing says steven 
rosenstone of the ann arbor schools center for political studies 
macomb oakland and wayne counties are 922 percent white compared 
with 751 percent black in detroit detroits 206 percent 
unemployment includes people who have given up looking for jobs a 
third of detroiters surveyed lacked access to a car in good 
condition meaning blacks cannot get out to the betterpaying 
jobs 
i think things are going to get worse before it gets better 
rosenstone says 
what detroit needs is jobs says berg explaining mayor youngs 
sometimes controversial strategies knocking down a neighborhood 
for a chrysler corp plant plans to demolish another neighborhood 
to expand the airport and to exploit the free trade pact 
encouraging more riverfront development such as the downtown 
renaissance center complex 
detroit is lifting itself from the doldrums of population decay 
auto industry slumps and a bad image say hubbard and berg 
during last octobers devils night about 30000 residents from 
an array of community groups patrolled the streets to dampen the 
annual arson spree 
the detroit civic center hosted 14 percent more business in 1989 
over 1988 an increase to 84 million visitors a survey of 24 
major metropolitan areas by national accounting firm grant thornton 
found detroits economy advanced in the 1989 fourth quarter to its 
highest in five years 
the racial controversy over a white woman heading the council of 
a mostly black city ended with maryann mahaffeys election last 
fall to council president 
the detroit pistons who play their home games 30 miles north of 
downtown won their second straight nba champsionship 
ten years from now detroit will be more of an information and 
service industry for manufacturing well be more of a convention 
industry hubbard says stressing the need to shift from the 
cyclical auto industry that has dominated and determined much of 
detroits past 
and the city might just make it over the 1million mark in the 
census count neithercut says 
berg says there are easily 30000 detroiters missed by the 
count 
i think all this is going to turn around i think the movement 
to the suburbs will collapse you cant have a rotten core in the 
doughnut rich says the same economic forces working on the 
city will work on them 
people in the suburbs will realize they dont want those 
overpriced homes and theyll reclaim the city rich says 
pointing to the socalled gentrification of washington dc 
detroit is not going to be the bangladesh of the midwest

lenny clarke is a fast talker which might 
explain why he was torn between politics and comedy 
while in his early 20s clarke ran for mayor city council and a 
congressional seat in cambridge mass but he eventually chose the 
tougher course and became a comedian 
thats good fortune for tv fans clarke stars in lenny a 
cbs comedy on wednesdays about a boston bluecollar irishcatholic 
family thats one of the funniest new shows of the season 
lenny is not a man who suffers lifes indignities silently he 
has an line on everything and its from his lips to your funny 
bone 
clarke grew up in the massachusetts stronghold of the kennedys 
and like them went through harvard but clarke was on foot every 
day i passed through harvard yard on my way to high school 
clarke says 
at the age of 13 he personally contacted thomas p tip 
oneill former speaker of the us house of representatives and 
got his father admitted to a local hospital which had a long 
waiting list 
as a student at the university of massachusetts clarke 
supported himself as a janitor in the mayors office in cambridge 
then he decided to really clean up city hall 
it was 1975 and my friends convinced me i should run for 
mayor he says i was 21 so what the hell i gave it a shot i 
was upset about the way they were treating the homeless and the 
elderly i lost but i still cleaned up city hall as janitor then 
i ran for city council and came in 16th out of 26 they only picked 
nine 
next he ran for congress when tip oneill retired by then i 
was a fulltime comedian he says when joseph p kennedy ii 
bought a house in the district i dropped out of the race i spent 
80 but i forced him to spend 2 million i still got a few 
writein votes 
as lenny callahan in the cbs comedy clarkes a man who holds 
down two jobs to support his wife and three children hes got a 
father whose opinions are more outrageous than his an 
independentminded mother whos rarely allowed to open her mouth in 
her husbands presence and a goodfornothing brother 
the scripts for lenny have been running longer than the 
usual sitcom script thats to accommodate clarkes rapid tongue 
i talk so fast everybody on the shows starting to talk faster 
he says 
on the set this day hes rehearsing a scene with eugene roche 
who plays his father and alice drummond who plays his mother lee 
garlington also stars as his wife and peter dobson is the brother 
my father passed away but having gene around is like having 
my father around clarke says of roche hes always there for 
me my sister saw the pilot and wrote gene a sweet letter and my 
mom approves of the woman playing her 
the set looks just like my house growing up and were like a 
big family on the show we call everybody every day i grew up with 
four sisters three brothers mom and dad and one bathroom 
as a former politician clarke also has a few campaign promises 
i think cbs will go to first and i think my show will be one of 
the shows that turns it around 
cbs has been in last place in the ratings for several years and 
clarke faces formidable ratings competition from abcs the wonder 
years and nbcs unsolved mysteries on wednesday nights 
clarke has no children of his own but says if the shows a 
hit ill have kids in every room my wifes the one thing thats 
more important to me than the show its family first 
he met his wife while performing in a comedy club in birmingham 
ala shes a redhaired jewish girl named ferd he says the 
first week after i met her my phone bill was 600 i said i could 
fly there cheaper we got married a year to the day after we met 
that was six years ago 
it was about the time he dropped out of the congressional race 
that clarke decided to move to los angeles 
my wife felt i had reached my water level in boston he 
says i sold out all my performances she said if i wanted to see 
how good i was id have to come here i came out here and i 
couldnt even get on stage i got a few walkons for 20 a night 
for the next few years i lived in la and flew to boston 
every week to perform it was the time of the air fare wars and a 
ticket was 198 i made enough to pay for the ticket and live out 
here i once owed the airline 13000 on my credit card when they 
started the frequent flier program i broke all the records i sent 
all my relatives to europe and hawaii and i still have 30000 free 
miles left 
clarke was discovered while making one of his rare los angeles 
appearances by someone from wittthomas productions paul junger 
witt and tony thomas were persuaded to go see him and then jeff 
sagansky president of cbs entertainment 
sagansky immediately ordered a show to be created for clarke

when water came to this droughtstricken 
andean village it seemed like a miracle but within a day it was 
clear it was an omen of disaster 
the water didnt come from rain it surged from an underground 
spring that started flowing through a crack in the village square 
this year within a day half the village was flooded and now maca 
is sinking into the earth 
the crack was the result of tremors from sabancaya a nearby 
volcano that lumbered to life in august after several months 
dormancy 
the 19720foot sabancaya has been rumbling off and on since 
1987 in late april it began spewing gases ash and rocks sending 
up clouds over 3 miles high 
more than 600 earth tremors a day kept farmers and villagers 
jittery until the volcano appeared to calm down in june but 
vulcanologists now warn it could erupt any day 
sabancaya is 80 miles north of arequipa perus secondlargest 
city scientists say the citys 500000 people wouldnt be 
endangered by an eruption 
but the people of the steep slopes and precipitous valleys 
around the volcano have a lot to worry about 
mateo casaverde director of the geophysical institute of peru 
says an eruption would send a massive landslide thundering down the 
populated colca and siguas valleys burying towns and fields along 
the way 
thousands of tons of ice mud and rock could shake loose from 
sabancaya and the neighbouring 20790foot mountain of nevado 
ampato he said 
casaverde believes the landslide could be of a similar magnitude 
to the one that buried the northern andean town of yungay in 1970 
killing all 20000 inhabitants 
lava from sabancaya represents no real threat however 
vulcanologists say the lava has never flowed farther than 6 miles 
from the crater in previous eruptions thousands of years ago 
several thousand farmers and their famililes live in the shadow 
of sabancaya in the villages of maca pinchollo achoma and 
cabanaconde they are the ones casaverde pinpoints as the first 
victims in an eruption 
despite having been evacuated several times the villagers 
always return to look after their crops of potatoes and corn and 
their livestock 
the known dangers are bad enough but the geophysical institute 
also fears what it does not know it says it lacks equipment and 
staff to predict when the volcano is going to erupt 
were not experts said leonides ocola who heads a team of 
volcanologists in arequipa studying sabancaya just because some 
of our members have been to universities doesnt mean were 
qualified to be studying the volcano but if we dont no one else 
will 
and the longer villagers stay the more they and their livestock 
are at risk several thousand head of cattle sheep and llamas have 
already died from grazing on ashcovered vegetation 
residents are also suffering from respiratory illnesses like 
silicosis caused by inhaling ash and sulphurous and carbon monoxide 
fumes which have darkened skies in the area 
if you think about it theyre breathing the equivalent of 
ground glass ocola said 
the volcano is also threatening majes a 11 billion irrigation 
project near arequipa one of the largest in the world 
if it blows im going to look for another job said rafael 
urday head of operations at the 16billioncubicfoot dam that 
provides water for the majes project 
project coordinators fear an eruption could destroy miles of 
canals causing millions of dollars in damage 
the colca canyon one of perus biggest tourist attractions 
would also be threatened by an eruption the canyon plunges 11220 
feet the worlds deepest gorge 
nearby village artisans embroider delicate and complex designs 
on skirt and blouses llamas wander through picturesque villages 
and ancient stone agricultural terraces 
the colca valley also is sprinkled with ruins from the preinca 
huari culture 
the influx of tourists already cut to a trickle by fears of a 
growing rural insurgency and highway robbery would likely dry up 
altogether if towns and roads are destroyed by an eruption

playing lips manlis in dick tracy was a 
cinch but paul sorvino worried that he couldnt act with enough 
cold evil for the role of the mafia don in goodfellas 
i think i was more attracted to martin scorsese and others 
involved than i was to the part says the rangy moonfaced 
actor i never felt the part was sufficiently like me to be 
really good in it but i thought i would take a shot anyway 
most of the time when i read a part i know i can do it and i 
know how to do it very rarely will i take an assignment that i 
dont have a strong inkling about in terms of its playing in this 
case i really didnt feel i had that kind of lethality that the 
part called for but i was willing to make the investigation into 
my innards and come up with and strengthen that kernel of whatever 
part of my personality that might exist 
the reviews indicate sorvinos success he has been praised as 
the figure of stability albeit evil amid the triggerhappy 
goodfellas who include robert de niro ray liotta and joe 
pesci sorvino is don paul cicero who directs the misdeeds of a 
brooklyn mob over a 30year period 
its not a matter of his actually doing it he orders it 
explained sorvino he does it with the same dispatch he would 
order asparagus i dont want to see him again to have that kind 
of stonelike internal persona must come out as absolutely 
believable in terms of his remorseless souless business 
on the other hand i had to retain a humanity a love for 
henry hill liotta a love for my children and for all the right 
things an august gentleman in his middle years and then to his 
twilight years behaving as one should as head of a corporation 
except that their product is death 
youd think that sorvino would have special insight into the 
goodfellas world having grown up in brooklyn youd be wrong 
i never had any truck with gangsters or tough people he 
said our lives were very different i never saw beatings i knew 
these things existed as we all did there were certain gangsters 
who lived in the neighborhood but i never saw them i never had 
anything to do with them 
i was like ferdinand the bull 6 feet 2 inches of poetic 
sensibility a good bit of athleticism and strength but my ideas 
were more about keats and shakespeare and verdi and pucci and 
constantin stanislavski 
the husky sorvino graduated from brooklyns lafayette high 
school and began acting in summer stock his acting career failed 
to take off because as he once explained i had the body of an 
olympic athlete but with a cherubic face the look was off so i 
was hard to cast i sang and acted in new york but i was only 
marginally effective 
with a wife and three children to support he veered into 
advertising and became an agency vice president but after seeing 
jack warden performing in the man in the glass booth he 
realized he had to return to acting by this time the face and the 
body seemed more compatible and the jobs kept coming 
sorvino has appeared on broadway that championship season 
in tv series well get by chiefs and in films reds 
oh god slow dancing in the big city often he has been 
cast as a hoodlum the brinks job bloodbrothers dick 
tracy never had he faced such a challenge as paulie cicero 
that kind of deadliness is so antithetical to my nature that 
it took me two full months to find it he said when i crossed 
a mirror once when i was preparing all of a sudden i saw that in 
myself and i was startled i couldnt believe that existed in me 
im in good company because that also existed in shakespeare 
otherwise he couldnt have written those horrific villains 
sorvino plans to pursue a less villainous endeavor opera 
singing after two more films rocketeers and life in the 
food chain he will make his redebut in grand opera he 
appeared in die fledermaus with the seattle opera

the garretts passed on to their heirs two 
family traditions collecting fine objects and adding on to their 
mansion 
t harrison garrett bought carefully but even so his 
collections had outgrown evergreen house a few years after he moved 
in in 1878 he either had to stop buying the coins rare books 
prints and manuscripts or build more rooms 
so he added on and on a wing here a library there servants 
quarters and reading rooms 
sixty years and a few generations later the classic revival 
house ended up as 48 rooms with a separate wing for the gymnasium 
school room and bowling alley 
there are other big houses in the united states this is a 
little bit different because the house actually grew out of the 
collections said susan g tripp director of university 
collections at johns hopkins university which owns the museum 
as the collections grew they loved adding to the house to house 
the collections 
the house museum reopened to the public last month after a 
threeyear 43 million renovation to replace the heating air 
conditioning wiring plumbing and roof the furniture was 
refurbished by sothebys restorations 
the yellow mansion is a fine example of the way people of wealth 
and culture lived in the early days of the 20th century in the 
midatlantic region tripp said 
the garretts immense wealth was built on commerce and 
investment banking two generations of garretts served as president 
of the baltimore amp ohio railroad 
the familys passion for beauty and the arts is evidenced by 
their collection of tiffany light fixtures and glassware a theater 
decorated by russian designer leon bakst and a collection of dutch 
marquetry furniture from the 18th and 19th centuries 
the former bowling alley is a gallery for an extensive display 
of netsuke inro and lacquer boxes 18th and 19thcentury chinese 
snuff bottles chinese ceramics dating from 200 bc and japanese 
ceramics from the 18th to 19th centuries 
exhibition rooms on the second floor display a comprehensive 
collection of tiffany and steuben glass rookwood pottery and 16 
paintings by dufy works by modigliani degas and vuillard are 
scattered throughout the mansion 
the house boasts a splendid bathroom where the window frame 
shutters cabinet and water tank are gilded with 23 carat gold 
leaf the floors walls and ceilings were finished in a marble 
mosaic 
people who visit love to see the grandeur of a house people 
come to see not so much each object but the house as a whole 
said tripp 
john work garrett a career diplomat who inherited the house in 
1920 continued the family traditions of collecting and enlarging 
the house until he died in 1942 
john work garrett originally was motivated to be a collector 
of books and coins said james garrett of baltimore the 
grandnephew of john work garrett and a member of the board of the 
evergreen foundation he was particularly interested in books 
that dealt with the natural world they had a real appreciation and 
desire to preserve wonderful things 
the estate is tucked away on 50 acres in the city a few blocks 
from johns hopkins university the property and its collections 
were given to the university on garretts death 
the renovation was carried out in a sensitive way to the 
intent of the wills of the last residents that is be used for 
future generations garrett said 
their motivation would have been for developing a collection 
which would be available to share he said throughout their 
lives they didnt specifically open the doors to the city but 
they did share their things with friends and acquaintances they 
did have performances by various theater and music groups that 
sometimes were in residence so they opened the house up to others 
in that way 
they were very thoughtful in what they chose to add to the 
collection the chinese and japanese works being an example and 
specific in certain areas of the book collection 
the reading room added in 1885 contains painted panels 
depicting each of john work garretts diplomatic postings rome 
berlin the hague paris rome argentina venezuela luxembourg 
and washington 
he was interested in early voyages and travels he collected 
the maps the explorers used he was a very fussy collector people 
asked why he didnt have a gutenberg he had looked for a wonderful 
copy but it was a continual search for best one said jane katz 
assistant director of museums for johns hopkins 
alice warder garrett johns wife had a passion for the visual 
and performing arts under her direction the gymnasium was turned 
into a theater designed by bakst a russian artist who dazzled 
europe with his imaginative costume and set designs for the ballet 
russe it is the only surviving theater designed by bakst 
the designs on the walls the stage sets and decorations belong 
to what is considered one of the largest and most important private 
collections of baksts works he decorated the walls and ceilings 
with stencils based on russian peasant motifs

seemingly poised three years ago to supplant 
ritchie valens as the most successful mexicanamerican rockers 
ever los lobos turned away now theyre back to reclaim their 
turf 
the neighborhood a collection of bluesy rockers and pointed 
social commentary is the first the rock world has heard from this 
east los angeles band since their cover version of valens la 
bamba saturated the airwaves in the summer of 1987 
most musicians would sell their soul for a hit of the magnitude 
of la bamba los lobos acted as if theyd stumbled upon a 
hornets nest 
we were becoming like a household word said songwriter 
louie perez i was at the checkout stand and i could hear us 
blaring out of a car radio thats a real good thing but its 
another thing you have to deal with its as scary being struggling 
as it is equally frightening being successful 
the 15yearold band reacted to stardom by recording la 
pistola y el corazon a collection of mexican folk tunes as 
expected it was commercial suicide 
los lobos have a definite lovehate relationship with la 
bamba in recent concerts theyve pointedly refused to play the 
one song with which most of the general public identifies them 
thats because it was a cover song by a band that takes fierce 
pride in its own material 
if it was one of our own songs i think we would have felt a 
lot differently about it said singer david hidalgo who shares 
writing chores with perez and cesar rosas for a lot of people 
that was all they were expecting from us we were getting tired of 
that and wanted to get away from it 
so for the second time in their career los lobos abandoned 
rock n roll at least temporarily 
i talked to people who said that it really took a lot of guts 
to not chase after the heels of the big hit and to do something 
that was not going to be a hit record but really said something 
really meant something perez said 
we didnt snub our nose at success we appreciate what 
happened in a responsible way we put out a record of music that 
was not known to people in the united states it also gave us 
enough time to take a little bit of a break to cleanse ourselves 
of things to get back on track 
we personally needed to reaffirm our identity to ourselves as 
well as show some responsibility he added 
in interviews members of los lobos talk a lot about 
responsibility to themselves as musicians and to their community 
as role models 
sometimes it seems responsibility weighs too heavily on this 
band the neighborhood retrieves the sense of fun that was 
missing from by the light of the moon their last album of rock 
originals without sacrificing social conscience 
you cant take a song such as jennys got a pony too 
seriously especially when a chorus of neighborhood kids are 
singing in the background los lobos also cover an old rhythm and 
blues song called georgia slop 
we wanted to get away from the kind of deep introspective 
narrative feel that by the light of the moon had perez said 
but we somehow gravitated to something we wanted to say the 
neighborhood has a lot to say about the inner city and urban 
life 
perez doesnt live in east los angeles anymore but his mother 
still lives in the house where he grew up the neighborhood has 
deteriorated to the point where his mother has iron bars covering 
her windows and makes sure shes home by dusk after visiting her 
son and his family 
the disillusionment that perez and other band members feel about 
their neighborhood is reflected in the new albums title cut 
the accessibility and affordability of hard drugs in the 
community is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of the 
neighborhood he said in the song we take a particular family 
and go from brother sister father and mother to show how one 
family is torn by the social and economic struggles 
he calls the neighborhood the most direct song the band has 
ever written but its still in terms general enough so a listener 
can feel its his or her neighborhood the band is talking about 
not los lobos 
its really easy for us being in an ethnic group not so much 
a minority any more living in a very insular kind of community 
to write things that are directly out of our personal reality he 
said we wanted to take things beyond those boundaries and 
communicate an idea that were all survivors 
musically the neighborhood is a melange of folk rock 
country and blues one song even sounds vaguely irish john hiatt 
and levon helm lend their voices to a few verses 
but listen closely to be still a gentle hidalgo and 
perezpenned ballad it may represent an important middle ground 
for a band thats won a grammy for its mexican recordings yet also 
plays for fistpumping rock fans 
that was the last song we wrote for this record and it seems 
that might be a new direction that might be leading to something 
else hidalgo said that was the first time we successfully 
used traditional mexican rhythms with english lyrics 
its a combination of rock and traditional little by little 
theyre moving closer together

nobody from the lost generation of american 
expatriate writers has been more lost than robert mcalmon 
he squandered fame fortune and friends during the 1920s in 
paris he lost the manuscript of his major work family 
panorama and practically all his belongings fleeing the nazi 
occupation in 1940 and somewhere near oblivion mcalmon lost his 
life to alcohol at desert hot springs calif on feb 2 1956 
mcalmon the last of the lost is the one whose life most 
exactly fulfilled gertrude steins prophecy that his generation was 
indeed lost 
but as ernest hemingway replied to stein the sun also 
rises it is rising finally for mcalmon 35 years after his death 
with the publication for the first time in the united states of his 
two surviving novels village and postadolescence 
the university of new mexico press with the prodding and 
editing of english doctoral candidate edward ns lorusso sold out 
it first printing of village in a few months this summer and 
is going into a second printing postadolescence and about 20 
mcalmon short stories will be published next year 
at this point mcalmon is a discovery lorusso says most 
people have only known him as a footnote to the story of the lost 
generation more of a social figure than a literary figure and 
that may change 
the spare straightforward village is a series of loosely 
linked sketches set in the fictional town of wentworth nd 
around the turn of the century turning the century is precisely 
what mcalmon set out to do lorusso says 
there is a difference between village and winesburg ohio 
or main street that really does give mcalmon the edge he says 
he has one foot in the 20th century i think while sinclair 
lewis and sherwood anderson are still sort of 19th century in 
their approaches theres sentimentality and a lot of judgment and 
direction on how the reader should feel about characters which 
mcalmon doesnt do and which hemingway also went on not to do 
its left to the reader to make those kinds of decisions and i 
think mcalmon might really have been the starting point of that 
like many american towns wentworth is made up of disparate 
desperate people who somehow nonetheless have a collective 
conscience consciousness and will mcalmons eye roves from family 
to clique quirk to eccentricity 
having grown up in a town very similar to the wentworth of 
village i think he mcalmon is very conscious of this fact that 
the individual is robbed of his or her individuality because of 
this collective consciousness 
mcalmon was born on march 9 1896 in clifton kan son of an 
irishborn presbyterian minister and the youngest of eight 
children the family moved from town to town and stayed mainly 
poor says mcalmons nephew george mcalmon an attorney in el 
paso texas 
village thats the family thats autobiographical as far 
as i can tell george mcalmon says 
as a young man robert went to new york and became an artists 
model there he met and married british heiress winifred ellerman 
who wrote under the pen name of bryher an odd marriage as bryher 
was an acknowledged lesbian when they divorced mcalmon received a 
large settlement which enabled him to establish a small publishing 
business in paris during the early 20s 
if he has his rightful place its more often given him as a 
publisher than as a writer lorusso says he did publish 
hemingways three stories and ten poems he did publish steins 
the making of americans he did publish other things by hd 
hilda doolittle william carlos williams and nathanael west its 
easy to see yes he was the one who started these people and got 
them into print first 
but as a writer i think this is where he is likely to be some 
kind of a discovery 
lorusso says the missing body of mcalmons work including 
dozens of short stories must be resurrected in print so his proper 
place in literature can be assessed 
i think at that point we can decide objectively whether or not 
mcalmon was the beginning of the whole new literary tradition the 
break from the 19th century the break from the british english so 
commonly used by people like henry james and edith wharton 
his own generation of writers with a few exceptions already 
had relegated him to a literary scrapheap even though he had given 
so many of them money food and their first break 
it had been mcalmon who paid for hemingways 1923 trip to spain 
from which emerged the sun also rises he helped james joyce 
type ulysses editing and rearrangingportions of molly blooms 
concluding streamofconsciousness soliloquy 
he literally supported joyce for a long period of time 
lorusso says 
but when mcalmon wrote a memoir about the paris period being 
geniuses together joyce called it the office boys revenge 
and when f scott fitzgerald learned that charles scribners 
sons might consider publishing mcalmons family panorama he 
wrote to scribners editor maxwell perkins advising him to pass 
by the way fitzgeralds letter says mcalmon is a bitter 
rat and im not surprised at anything he does or says hes failed 
as a writer and tries to fortify himself by tying up to the big 
boys like joyce and stein and despising everyone else part of his 
quarrel with ernest hemingway some years ago was because he 
assured ernest that i was a fairy god knows he shows more 
creative imagination in his malice than in his work next he told 
morley callaghan that ernest was a fairy hes a pretty good 
person to avoid 
perkins passed 
all those people he literally supported turned on him 
lorusso says 
what was it about mcalmon anyway 
honesty says lorusso because he was willing to look 
objectively at people around him including himself 
generosity 
i think its like with any kind of handout says lorusso 
maybe at first youre appreciative of it then after a while you 
become resentful 
mcalmon had money mcalmon had a press plus with his own 
personality he ended up alienating just about everybody when he 
tried to establish a foothold in america to try to get some of his 
work published here it all worked against him 
after mcalmon returned to the united states in 1940 with little 
more than the clothes he wore he took a job in his uncles medical 
supply business in el paso 
he got out of europe just ahead of the germans nephew 
george mcalmon says at that time i was 16 i knew him pretty 
well he had a drinking problem all those guys writers they 
either went to aa or they died from it he died from it 
it was a sad existence for him he wasnt doing any 
literary work he went downhill lost a lot of interest his 
friends died i remember him commenting on when james joyce died 
he moved to california in 1953 to be near his sister victoria 
less than three years later he was dead

vince gill has resurrected a sputtering 
recording career with a classic country music weeper about lost 
love 
gill was a little noticed singer throughout the mid1980s who 
finally asked to be released from his recording contract with rca 
records in 1987 
he went without a record deal until he emerged this year with 
mca records and put out the acclaimed single when i call your 
name and the album of the same name the lp is closing in on gold 
status 500000 copies sold or 10 times more than his three 
previous albums 
a lot of people figured i was done the amiable 33yearold 
gill said as he reflected on his lean years nothing major had 
happened and people started losing enthusiasm 
i never doubted the fact that i had a hit record in me it was 
just trying to find it 
gill found it with when i call your name which he wrote and 
which has become one of the years top country hits the song 
featuring a whining steel guitar and a compelling piano solo tells 
the story of a man who thinks about his lover all day and rushes 
home to find a goodbye note on the table patty loveless provides 
backup vocals 
its the kind of song that gave me goose bumps said gill 
former lead singer for pure prairie league it has a haunting 
chorus and its a very lonesome and sad song 
when i first heard it i definitely felt that if this was not 
a hit then i could throw my hands up and say i dont have a clue 
to what is 
gill said he treats records the way a casting director does a 
movie every part is so critical there are things that can 
enhance them or detract and i think we made all the right calls in 
what we did to the record 
it really took off when patty put her vocals on there i just 
love our voices together 
even without his newfound success gill had fashioned a 
rewarding behindthescenes career using his velvet tenor as a 
backup vocalist for recording sessions by his count he has sung 
on records done by more than 100 other singers 
he was with pure prairie league from 1979 to 1983 recording 
three albums and singing their hit let me love you tonight 
gill the son of a lawyer in norman okla grew up playing 
bluegrass and country music 
he was considering a career as a pro golfer when he chose to 
join the group bluegrass alliance instead he later joined 
sundance then hooked up with pure prairie league 
he arrived in nashville with dreams of a country music career 
but found himself perceived as a pop singer instead because of his 
stint with pure prairie league 
i had sung let me love you tonight and been on american 
bandstand gill said but i cant complain that i got to sing 
a no 1 pop record and met the solid gold dancers 
he was able to launch his solo career but didnt meet with much 
success until this year his album has been near the top of the 
country music charts and the single was no 1 during the summer 
its been like christmas a few months early gill said 
he called on some old recording session friends to provide guest 
vocals on the album loveless emmylou harris reba mcentire herb 
pederson of the desert rose band and kathie baillie of baillie and 
the boys 
i was there for their careers and helped their careers and 
they seemed to have a similar feeling for me gill said i 
think its a good calling card to have them in your camp 
the album includes dance hall swing tunes rodeo songs and 
contemporary pop music 
weve got a real good chance to go gold gill said we 
even got on the pop charts for awhile its been fun 
looking back im kind of thankful in a way that the success 
didnt happen right away thats real dangerous to go to the top 
and be the rage it doesnt allow time to build the way down might 
be just as quick 
he has no regrets about choosing music as a career instead of 
golf 
music is more fun much more creative i love golf but music 
is much more rewarding by writing songs and communicating with 
folks he said 
thats the true godgiven talent i was given i dont think a 
golf swing is my best blessing i can sing a little better than i 
can make a fourfooter

the joy of life is what most people 
recall about the years they battled death in saranac lakes 
tuberculosis sanitariums 
it was a very hopeful atmosphere there was very little 
depression said george conklin 81 of woodbridge conn his 
wife anne moved with the couples two children to saranac lake 
when her husband contracted tb in the navy in 1944 
mrs conklin remembered lots of parties in the village that 
came to be known as the city of sick 
we had parties for the people who lived here and parties for 
the patients it was very cheerful she said 
the conklins were among about 100 people at a reunion last month 
of former tb patients who took the openair cure in the 
adirondack mountains of upstate new york extended exposure to the 
bracing mountain air and regimented bed rest was thought to arrest 
the disease which was brought under control by antibiotics in the 
early 1950s 
in the trudeau sanatorium and the private cure cottages with 
rambling unheated porches where patients would sit by the hour in 
the mountain air the goal was to get well 
the enemy was a congestive respiratory disease that attacks the 
lungs and other organs so prevalent was tb in the early decades of 
this century that it became known as the white plague and 
experts say many of those afflicted with it carried the stigma 
that people do now who suffer acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
indeed the aids crisis is blamed for a resurgence in tb this 
summer experts at an aids conference in san francisco were told 
that tb has emerged as the worlds biggest bacterial killer and 
that scientists fear the immune systemweakening aids will again 
allow it to become a major health problem especially in africa 
kenneth ho 67 of syracuse ny said doctors tricked him and 
other patients when lung xrays revealed his tb infection in late 
1948 
you accept the news of the diagnosis tb then comes word of 
the therapy a sanitarium he recalled as he and about three 
dozen other reunion participants toured the grounds of the former 
trudeau sanatorium which has been a training center for a 
corporate management group since the early 1960s 
the doctors fool you into accepting it they say well maybe 
youll be there three months he said it turns out to be 
three years it turns out there are people whove been there five 
years 
some patients stayed longer though usually doctors tried to 
move them from trudeau to cure cottages to make beds available for 
newer patients the families paid for their stay ho said 
many of the onetime tuberculars said they were too young to be 
daunted by spending several months or years doing quite literally 
nothing 
the motto of openair curing was never stand when you can 
sit and never sit when you can lie the onetime patients said 
edward burgeni 76 of greenville sc said he worked out 
all kinds of strategies to pass his two years of bed rest in 
saranac lake starting in 1934 
once he recalled being chided by a doctor just for playing 
chess with another patient 
time still had a way of going by he said 
people who were ambulatory would come in the nurses would 
come in he said each thing was an event a highlight i would 
tell you quite frankly that time did not wear heavily at all 
burgeni said many people who survived tb were strengthened 
emotionally others turned into what he called professional 
invalids 
some people used this as a stepping stone in life as part of 
a growing experience he said there were some people who found 
in this life their mother and they were afraid to get well 
they never made the break to get out or if they did they would 
return very promptly because the outside world was very 
frightening

new york manager stump merrill has stopped his 
daily medical checks on don mattingly mattingly is feeling just 
fine even if its way too late to the help the yankees this 
season 
but theres 1991 and the yankees buried deep in the american 
league east cellar this season will need all the help they can 
get and that starts with mattingly their former allstar first 
baseman 
the first couple of days back he merrill was asking me how i 
felt now he just puts me in there said mattingly who has 
rebounded the last three weeks after spending six weeks on the 
disabled list with a bad back 
mattingly went 2for3 with three rbis sunday as the yankees 
beat the milwaukee brewers 72 since coming off the dl earlier 
this month hes 16for42 and has hit safely in 11 of 13 games 
sundays performance lifted his batting average to 260 far 
below his career mark of 332 but hes demonstrated to merrill and 
himself hes ready for next year 
as far as coming back off injury i think ive accomplished 
all i wanted to do getting back and just playing some defense and 
playing on a regular basis and knowing that im going to be fine 
for next year mattingly said 
thats really what i wanted to accomplish i think its been a 
success 
its a good step for us coming into next year ill just keep 
up with the work and stay with the routines and next season i can 
play every day with it 
when did mattingly know hed be able to play again with his 
back 
soon as i got all the information from the doctors who 
assured me that there was really nothing i could do to hurt it i 
just needed to keep up with my work and if i do exercises and 
strength im going to be fine he said 
hes all right merrill said if we get the question 
answered before this season even ends so you dont go to spring 
training with some doubts its great hes worked hard on his 
rehabilitation and gone about his business 
jesse barfield also had three rbis sunday including a 
basesloaded double to spark a fourrun fifth inning greg cadaret 
pitched four perfect innings of relief for his third save and dave 
eiland 21 got the victory 
greg vaughn hit his 17th homer of the season for the brewers 
who are just above the yankees in the al east milwaukee starter 
bill krueger left after 1 23 innings with a groin strain and 
reliever tom edens 45 gave up the four runs in the fifth 
it was allinall a lackluster sunday afternoon game said 
milwaukee manager tom trebelhorn the yankees big inning started 
when bob geren batting 212 walked and alvaro espinoza hitting 
224 was hit by a pitch 
you allow less than 220 hitters to get on base without 
swining the bat you set yourself up for something negative 
trebelhorn added

soaring crude oil prices because of the 
persian gulf crisis will mean higher operating costs for farmers 
but an agriculture department analysis says there is a brighter 
side too 
exports of us agricultural products are expected to rise as 
recycled oil dollars whet the appetites of overseas buyers 
the shutoff of petroleum exports from iraq and kuwait has 
raised the specter of rapid destabilizing oil price increases 
perhaps by enough to spark a worldwide recession the report 
said 
but the track record of previous oil price shocks in 197475 and 
again in 197981 shows that us agricultural exports do not 
necessarily decline 
recycled petrodollars can under the right conditions boost 
world demand for us farm products the report said the 
strength of this linkage to a large degree depends on the 
monetary policies adopted by the industrialized countries 
according to usda researchers if oil prices were to average 25 
per barrel in 1990 and continue up at a 12 percent annual rate the 
value of us agricultural exports would rise 1 billion to 3 
billion over the next three years 
the lower value in the range would reflect tight monetary 
policies while the higher value assumes that more 
accommodative policies will be adopted 
in another report both were in the october issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine the departments economic research 
service said farmers are not only seeing higher fuel prices but can 
expect costlier agricultural chemicals and fertilizer 
world crude oil prices jumped 50 percent within three weeks of 
iraq invading kuwait the report said 
further price increases have occurred last week for example 
the november contract for light sweet crude oil traded for as high 
as 4010 per 42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
double the july price 
the usda agency using computer simulations said that while 
farm chemical and fertilizer prices are rising they will not do so 
in step with the crude oil increases 
instead the report said those supplies probably will rise 
about onefourth the percentage increase in oil prices and would be 
spread over 24 to 28 months 
however analysts cautioned that factors other than oil prices 
will influence the costs of agricultural production items or 
inputs in the coming months 
farmers expectations of crop and livestock prices will help 
determine acres planted next year and the demand for inputs the 
report said all these factors will further influence chemical 
and fertilizer prices 
but a review of trends over 28 years and computer models used in 
the projections suggest that prices for agricultural chemicals 
including petroleum based pesticides would rise 024 percent for 
each 1 percent rise in crude oil prices 
the initial 50 percent increase in crude oil prices for 
example would generate a 12 percent increase in agricultural 
chemical prices over the following 28 months 
by the same token augusts 50 percent hike in crude would mean 
fertilizer prices would go up about 13 percent 
 
washington ap chile has been officially declared by the 
agriculture department to be free of footandmouth disease and 
rinderpest two major cattle diseases that have impeded livestock 
and meat imports from the south american country 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said last week that the absence of 
the two diseases in chile means some of our prohibitions and 
restrictions on importing meat from chilean cattle sheep and 
goats can be removed 
however we must keep in place a number of special 
restrictions on imports of these meat products and we also will 
continue current restrictions on swine and pork products he 
said 
glosser said he doesnt expect chile to ship much meat but 
foresees the possibility of a new flow of llamas and alpacas 
coming into the united states under the liberalized rules 
special health certification testing and quarantine 
requirements have been developed for these animals he said 
llamas and alpacas will continue to be quarantined at the harry 
s truman animal import center a highsecurity facility on fleming 
key near key west fla before they are allowed us entry 
rinderpest and footandmouth disease are viral infections that 
strike clovenhoofed animals and are no threat to human health 
glosser said rinderpest has never been known to occur in chile 
and footandmouth was eradicated in 1987 
 
washington ap an annual report by the agriculture department 
shows the 1989 potato crop was worth a record 272 billion to 
growers 
that was up 27 percent from the value of the 1988 harvest and 61 
percent more than the 1987 crop the report said 
production at 370 million hundredweight was up 4 percent from 
1988 but was down 5 percent from 1987 
prices paid to farmers averaged 736 per 100 pounds last year 
compared with 602 in 1988 and 438 in 1987 the report said

stock prices partially recovered after a 
precipitous fall today on expectations the government will take 
action to support the stock market traders said 
meanwhile the dollar fell against the japanese yen following 
news of a budget agreement in washington 
the closely watched nikkei stock average of 225 issues finished 
the day at 2022186 down 76164 points or 363 percent from its 
friday finish 
at one point the index fell below the key 20000 level for the 
first time in 3 years 
its really snowballing everything all thats bad is just 
carrying over one stock trader said during the slide 
the nikkeis fall brought it closer to 19458 points the level 
at which it would have erased half its value from a peak of 
3891587 points at the end of last year 
dealers said the fall was caused in part by uncertainty over the 
middle east combined with continuing sales of stock by individual 
investors 
an estimated 400 million shares changed hands 
in a report released today salomon brothers asia ltd said the 
continuing distress of tokyo equity markets was primarily linked to 
growing fears about the possibility of war in the middle east 
but second and most ironic the market is suffering from the 
economys strong momentum abovepotential growth and higher oil 
prices together imply that central bank policy will need to tighten 
further later this year to stem inflationary pressures it said 
higher interest rates if realized would make stocks less 
attractive to investors 
mondays decline was halted by a lastminute buying spree 
stimulated by rumors that the ministry of finance would announce 
new market support measures traders said 
in foreign exchange dealings the dollar closed at 13715 yen 
down 080 yen from last fridays close 
dealers said the days trading was mixed on news of a budget 
settlement in the united states that might lead to lower interest 
rates as well as rumors that iraq might be willing to negotiate a 
compromise in the middle east

saddam husseins conquest of kuwait has 
sent economic shock waves around the globe doubling oil prices 
plaguing stock markets undermining business confidence and leaving 
poor countries in eastern europe and asia in dire straits 
but it has brought windfalls for oilproducing countries who 
will make billions of extra dollars this year as crude prices 
climb since iraqs invasion they have gone from 16 a barrel to 
around 40 
some analysts believe prices could pass the 65 mark before 
long fueling inflation and raising the specter of recession and 
higher interest rates 
the persian gulf crisis is not only disrupting world peace 
and security its also casting a dark shadow over the prospects 
for world economic development and prosperity japans finance 
minister ryutaro hashimoto declared last week in washington 
the industrialized world was better prepared to cope with this 
crisis than the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 despite inflationary 
pressures but the debtridden third world faces a grim time 
the financial times londons respected business daily said the 
iraqi invasion has put on hold hopes that the 1990s might usher 
in a new world order founded in the eclipse of communism and 
generating prosperity in which all mankind might share 
among the hardest hit victims so far are the infant democracies 
of eastern europe who face a hard winter as they struggle to 
reorient their socialist economies to the marketplace 
they have been dependent for decades on cheap soviet oil and 
made little effort to develop alternative energy supplies or curb 
consumption which had been double that of western europe 
earlier this year moscow cut back on its oil deliveries because 
of declining production and its own economic woes now romania 
poland and much of the rest of eastern europe with little hard 
currency to pay for increasingly expensive oil are in deep 
trouble 
in czechoslovakia officials say they will not be able to cope 
if oil prices hit 65 dollars a barrel 
if that happens wed have to give up on economic reforms i 
guess we wouldnt be the only ones said a finance ministry 
official in prague 
if the price of oil goes as high as 50 a barrel retail 
prices will go up so much that gasoline will become a luxury 
item said leszek plotczyk of the polands state fuel monopoly 
cpn 
the united nations embargo on trade with iraq is squeezing 
baghdad as intended but it is also causing hardship to many 
other countries costing them billions of dollars in lost trade 
iraq owed 30 billion to 40 billion to the soviet union 
france italy and others it was repaying some of that with oil 
now that that flow has been cut economists and government 
officials say the debts are a writeoff 
some countries are hoping that the positions they stake out in 
the gulf crisis even if painful now will pay off in the long 
run turkey which hopes some day to become a member of the 
european community trading bloc has taken big losses supporting 
the embargo against iraq 
this crisis will set a precedent as to how the west acts 
toward its allies said turkish central bank governor rusdu 
saracoglu 
impoverished asian countries like india the philippines 
bangladesh and sri lanka as well as arab states have lost 
billions of dollars in remittances from two to three million of 
their nationals working in kuwait 
the cost of airlifting home the hundreds of thousands of 
refugees who have fled kuwait and iraq has further drained their 
treasuries 
few of these countries already deep in the red will be able to 
cope with rising oil prices without substantial aid 
in india political analysts are predicting trouble for prime 
minister vp singhs already unstable government once the 
financial effects of the crisis are fully felt 
the world bank the international monetary fund the european 
community and other organizations have rallied to help cushion the 
economic hardships caused by the crisis 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar reported that 11 
countries have asked for assistance bulgaria india jordan 
lebanon the philippines romania sri lanka sudan tunisia yemen 
and yugoslavia 
japan has pledged 2 billion to help egypt jordan and turkey 
bear the brunt of the embargo south korea says it will donate 
30000 tons of rice worth 10 million to these countries and extend 
longterm lowinterest loans of 40 million 
the ec has pledged another 2 billion 
imf and world bank officials have said more money will be 
available from oil producers who are reaping hefty benefits from 
high oil prices

china will harvest a record 422 million tons of 
grain this year providing the economys lone bright spot amid poor 
factory output and growing government debt official reports said 
monday 
the china daily quoted agriculture vice minister chen yaobang as 
saying the grain crop will be about 15 million tons over last 
years record 407 million tons 
he said good harvests also are exected in cotton edible oils 
and sugar 
chens announcement comes as good news to the communist party 
leadership which typically emphasizes grain production on the 
premise that a wellfed population is its best guarantee of staying 
in power 
during the past 18 months the party has been under particular 
stress from the collapse of communist rule in the east bloc 
demands for greater democracy at home and deep divisions among 
party leaders on how to respond 
determined to maintain stability in the countryside at least 
the government last spring increased investment in land reclamation 
and irrigation and made more credit available to farmers it 
recentralized the sale of fertilizer and pesticides which had been 
sold on the free market and were becoming expensive as demand drove 
up prices 
the government also renewed its insistence that farmers plant 
more grain and fewer vegetables and other crops grain production 
slumped in the mid and late 1980s because farmers found they could 
earn more by planting other crops 
this summer the government announced plans to raise its grain 
purchase price but did not say by how much 
it also said the state would buy the entire grain harvest a 
practice abandoned in the 1980s in recent years the state 
contracted with each farmer to buy part of his harvest leaving him 
free to sell the rest on the free market for a potentially higher 
price the arrangement was considered a first step toward market 
reform 
however the china daily said the government feared farmers 
would not get good prices on the free market this year because the 
supply of grain was so plentiful and that would discourage them 
from planting grain next spring 
so far the government has not announced any increase in the 
price at which it sells grain to city residents which has remained 
unchanged for 25 years city dwellers pay about 2 cents a pound 
about oneseventh of what the state pays the farmers 
subsidizing grain has become a major drain on the state budget 
the china daily recently said that by western accounting methods 
the budget deficit this year will total 9 billion 
stateowned industry has become another drain with profits down 
more than 50 percent from last years level a record number of 
state factories are reported in the red

the new company formed between jvc and mca music entertainment 
group will market and promote the record labels mca geffen and 
grp in japan according to a statement from jvc manufacturer of a 
wide range of audio equipment records compact discs 
jvc spokesman masayuki murakami said the move was not related to 
reports of a buyout of mca by jvcs parent company the consumer 
electronics giant matsushita electric industrial co 
murakami said the agreement will cover records and compact 
discs music videos were under negotiation among the artists that 
record under the three labels are tom petty guns n roses

the deal gives matsushita access to audio software while helping 
mca market its products in japan said barry dargan senior

the new venture which will be owned equally by the two 
companies and begin operations next year also could help jvc 
develop a market for digital audio tape or dat 
murakami said mca approached jvc about the record deal and 
negotiations began last spring 
as far as our talks with mca are concerned it was nothing 
related to matsushita talks with mca murakami said 
last week matsushita confirmed it was holding talks with mca 
but refused to elaborate reports said the japanese company was 
considering a buyout of mca which includes universal pictures

the 133percent rise in the federal gasoline tax 
included in the proposed budget agreement could be good news for 
the nation chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca says 
our biggest economic need is lower interest rates everybody 
agrees to that iacocca said in a statement after negotiators 
reached agreement on the program sunday this budget package 
gives federal reserve chairman alan greenspan the tools to make 
sure we get them 
but other us automakers who have been wrestling with slumping 
sales rising gasoline prices and declining profits were more 
cautious when reacting to the greement reached this weekend between 
congressional leaders and the bush administration 
general motors corp spokesman bill noack said this morning that 
company officials were reviewing the proposal in the past gm has 
oppos let the fbi keep parts of its 
file on todd patterson of north haledon nj secret for 
national security reasons 
when patterson was an elementary school student in 1983 he 
began an ambitious project to prepare a personal world 
encyclopedia to that end he wrote letters to representatives of 
169 countries seeking information about their peoples and 
governments 
patterson mailed his inquiries in envelopes bearing the return 
address of laboratory disposable products a business operated by 
his parents from their home 
according to government lawyers the large amount of 
international mail generated by the project came to the attention 
of the federal bureau of investigation through classified means 
the agency opened an investigation but it apparently was halted 
after an agent visited the pattersons home and discovered the 
nature and purpose of todds correspondence 
patterson now a student at the state university of new york at 
plattsburgh requested copies of his personal fbi file in 1987 
the request made under the freedom of information act was 
denied patterson was told the files could not be released because 
of national security reasons 
some information from the files subsequently was released but 
the rest remained classified 
patterson sued the fbi and an unknown government agency in 1988 
seeking full disclosure of the files and monetary damages 
in response to his lawsuit the government offered to expunge 
his name from all fbi records the offer was not accepted 
us district judge alfred m wolin in new jersey threw out 
pattersons suit last year after looking at the entire fbi file he 
ruled that the files properly were exempted from disclosure under 
the foia 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals upheld that rulin last 
january 
in the appeal acted on today patterson contended that his 
rights under the privacy act of 1974 were violated by the fbi 
investigation 
the law strictly limits government investigations into the 
freespeech activities of us citizens 
the case is patterson vs fbi 891731

the court said it will review a ruling that arkansas may tax 
cable tv as long as it also imposes the levy on similar 
communication services such as the unscrambling of satellite 
signals 
with millions of dollars in tax revenue at stake the ruling was 
challenged in separate appeals by both the state and cable 
operators and subscribers 
arkansas in 1987 imposed its sales tax on cable tv service the 
law did not apply to those who own satellite dishes and subscribe 
to services that unscramble satellite signals 
also exempted from the tax were all newspaper sales and magazine 
subscription sales 
the arkansas supreme court ruled in february that the tax 
unlawfully discriminated against cable tv service because satellite 
service was excludedbut the state court said it is permissible 
for the state to exclude the newspaper and magazine sales 
we are unwilling to hold that all mass communications media 
must be taxed in the same way the state court said we must 
however hold that a tax which discriminates between mass 
communicators delivering the same service runs afoul of the first 
amendment guarantee of free expression 
by the time the state court ruled the arkansas legislature had 
amended the law to extend the tax to satellite service and all 
other distribution of television video or audio services with or 
without the use of wires 
the state court ordered arkansas officials to refund to cable 
operators and subscribers more than 8 million in taxes paid prior 
to enactment of the amended tax 
state officials seeking to avoid the refunds asked the us 
supreme court to overrule the state court decision 
the cable operators and subscribers also appealed urging the 
high court to issue a more sweeping decision that the state may not 
single out the electronic media for taxation when print media are 
exempt 
the justices in 1987 in a case from arkansas said states 
generally may not tax some types of publications while exempting 
others 
the court by a 72 vote struck down an arkansas sales tax 
imposed on general interest magazines but which exempted newspapers 
and religious professional trade and sports journals 
the cases acted on today are pledger vs medlock 9029 and 
medlock vs pledger 9038

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether oklahoma may collect a sales tax on cigarettes and other 
items sold at a shawnee convenience store owned and run by an 
indian tribe 
the justices said they will review a ruling that would bar the 
imposition of such a tax 
asked for its views the bush administration advised the 
justices to send the case back to a federal appeals court for 
further study the justices ignored that advice 
the store belongs to the citizen band potawatomi indian tribe 
and is located on land held in trust for the tribe by the federal 
government 
oklahoma law requires all vendors to collect from consumers 
sales taxes of 6 or 7 percent 4 percent for the state and 2 or 3 
percent for local communities 
the state also imposes an excise tax on the sale of cigarettes 
the potawatomis have never collected sales taxes or the 
cigarette excise tax on items sold in their convenience store in 
1987 state officials assessed the tribe 27 million for the sale 
and distribution of untaxed cigarettes 
the tribe challenged the assessment in court and us district 
judge lee r west blocked enforcement of the cigarette tax pending 
the tribes lawsuit 
west later ruled that cigarettes sold to tribal members could 
not be taxed but that the tribe must collect taxes on cigarettes 
sold to nonmembers 
but the 10th us circuit court of appeals last november ruled 
that the tribe does not have to collect any state or local taxes on 
items sold at the store even to nonmembers 
the appeals court said oklahoma officials wrongly relied on a 
1980 supreme court ruling in a washington state case to justify the 
taxing of sales to nontribal members 
in the 1980 case the appeals court said the indian tribe had 
opted to come under state jurisdiction it said because no 
such jurisdiction exists in this case oklahomas reliance on the 
1980 decision is misplaced 
in the appeal acted on today oklahoma officials said the 
case turns on whether federal law has preempted state law or 
whether state action has infringed tribal selfgovernment 
the appeal added the state simply suggests that the tribe may 
operate its government in any way that it sees fit however if the 
tribe operates a business in the state it must obey applicable 
state laws 
the case is oklahoma tax commission vs citizen band potawatomi

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether savings and loan associations and other financial 
institutions may claim tax deductions for reciprocal sales of 
mortgage loans 
with a reported 419 million plus interest at stake the court 
said it will hear internal revenue service arguments against 
allowing such deductions 
two federal appeals courts have ruled against the irs and one 
has ruled for the tax agency the justices decision expected by 
july will resolve the conflicting rulings 
an irs victory would mean more bad news for some struggling 
sampls 
in the lead case granted review today a greenville texas 
savings and loan challenged an irs refusal to treat the sale of its 
mortgage loans to another sampl as a transaction that generated a 
loss for tax purposes 
centennial savings bank formerly known as first federal savings 
and loan of greenville entered into a deal with another savings 
and loan in which it sold a package of interests in a group of 
residential mortgage loans for a similar package of mortgage loan 
interests 
the thrifts were taking advantage of a rule adopted in 1980 by 
the federal home loan bank board allowing reciprocal sales of 
depreciated substantially identical mortgage loans without 
having to record a loss for regulatory accounting purposes 
the rule allowed savings institutions to engage in transactions 
to generate deductible losses for federal tax purposes without 
worrying about failing to meet the bank boards minimum reserve and 
liquidity requirements 
in 1981 centennials mortgage loan portfolio was comprised 
primarily of longterm home mortgage loans that had been issued in 
the late 1960s at fixed interest rates significantly lower than 
current rates 
because of the low interest they earned the fair market value 
of these older loans fell far below their face amount 
centennial had a tax incentive for disposing of the old mortgage 
loans selling them would enable it to realize a tax loss based on 
the difference between the face amounts and the sale prices of the 
mortgages it sold 
after the irs ruled that centennial could not claim a tax 
deduction for the transaction the savings and loan paid its 
assessed taxes and sued for a refund a federal judge ruled for the 
government but the new orleansbased 5th us circuit court of 
appeals last november reversed the judges ruling 
the appeals court also ruled in cases involving savings and 
loans from san antonio and temple texas 
in seeking supreme court review government lawyers noted that 
the cincinnatibased 6th us circuit court of appeals had ruled 
that such transactions do not result in taxdeductible losses 
that case involves the cottage savings association of 
cincinnati 
the irs has advised that there are currently pending 
administratively and in the courts 96 cases involving approximately 
419 million excluding interest that turn on the resolution of 
the mortgage exchange issue the governments appeal in the 
centennial case said 
while the dispute was pending before the 5th circuit court 
centennial was found insolvent by the bank board and the federal 
savings and loan insurance corporation was appointed as receiver 
the successor resolution trust corp then took over as receiver 
the cases are us vs centennial savings bank 891926 and 
cottage savings association vs commissioner internal revenue

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
libel lawsuit stemming from advertisements comparing blue cross and 
blue shield services to those of a health industry competitor 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that could send 
us healthcares libel allegations against blue cross and blue 
shield to a federal jury in philadelphia 
at issue was whether some libel cases involving commercial 
speech could be held to less stringent standards than others 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in reviving healthcares 
suit last march relaxed the rules for commercialspeech libel 
cases 
since 1964 public figures including most businesses suing 
for libel must prove that the suedover statements are false and 
were made with actual malice knowledge or reckless disregard 
of falsity 
private citizens suing for libel face a far less demanding 
burden having to prove that the statements are false and were made 
negligently 
in ruling on healthcares lawsuit the 3rd circuit court said 
the more stringent actual malice standard need not be used when 
the allegedly libelous statements were advertisements 
the appeals court overturned a ruling by us district judge 
marvin katz who had dismissed the suit 
as described by the appeals court the underlying dispute stems 
from a comparative advertising war between giants of the health 
care industry in the delaware valley of southeastern 
pennsylvania 
blue cross and blue shield fired the first salvos in 1986 after 
losing some subscribers to the health maintenance organization 
hmo offered by healthcare 
blue cross and blue shield ran what it termed a deliberately 
aggressive and provocative comparative advertising campaign for 
about six months at a cost of 217 million 
healthcare responded to that campaign by starting its own 
comparative ad campaign and by suing its suit alleged among other 
things defamation 
the case is independence blue cross vs us healthcare

the texas railroad commission voted 21 monday 
against raising oil production in the east texas field by 8000 to 
15000 barrels a day one commissioner said the extra oil isnt 
needed despite the persian gulf crisis 
there is no shortage of oil on the market any more the 
only thing hiking the price of oil is the new york mercantile 
exchange based on rumor said commissioner john sharp 
sharp and commissioner jim nugent outvoted chairman kent hance 
in keeping the east texas field production at 86 percent the us 
energy department had asked the commission to increase production 
to help offset oil lost due to the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the commission in august voted to allow the production of about 
20000 more barrels of oil per day from wells outside the east 
texas field most of the higher production is coming from fields in 
the austin chalk in south texas 
all of the oil that was stopped from kuwait and iraq has been 
replaced either domestically by venezuela or by saudi arabia 
sharp said 
according to the railroad commission the state produced 178 
million barrels of oil a day last year down from 336 million a 
day in 1974 and 255 million a day in 1980 
many independent oil producers in east texas opposed the 
production incrnglish husband an americanized version of the british film 
starring dudley moore the show was started while the team was 
still taking classes at bmi only later when the musical was 
nearly finished did the two collaborators learn they couldnt get 
the rights to the movie they still havent but that hasnt 
stopped them from trying 
ira weitzman major domo of the musical theater program at 
playwrights horizons spotted them at one of their many 
presentations of songs from bedazzled 
he was interested in us as writers flaherty recalls he 
said show me what you have 
through playwrights the team got a government grant and a lot 
of encouragement to keep writing weitzman put them together with 
george c wolfe author of such offbroadway hits as the colored 
museum and spunk they collaborated on a musical called 
antler but it fizzled too 
it was a good idea in search of a story ahrens says now 
then they wrote the emperors new clothes which was 
produced as an hourlong childrens musical by theaterworks usa 
at new yorks town hall and later toured the country 
playwrights horizons nourished their next show lucky stiff 
a nonstop musical farce in which the title character is anything 
but alive 
the musical had a short run at playwrights horizons in 1988 and 
since then has had productions around the country and in japan a 
toronto company is pending for this season 
emotion was what ahrens and flaherty were looking for in their 
fifth musical project they found it in my love my love by 
trinidadborn writer rosa guy ahrens discovered the novel on a 
remainder shelf in a discount book shop it eventually became 
once on this island 
the story set in the french antilles is simple and sweet it 
tells the tale of i moune a darkskinned peasant girl who falls 
in love with a wealthy young mulatto she saves his life but he 
marries among his own class ti moune dies of a broken heart but 
the gods take pity on her they transform her into a tree to guard 
the young mans home 
the pair wrote once on this island in about six months 
we made an outline of the scenes ahrens recalls we said 
this or that will happen here and then we just started coming up 
with the songs and the songs became the story 
ahrens also wrote dialogue for the musical but the team found 
the shows energy level dropping whenever the characters stopped 
singing and began speaking 
its not that we set out to musicalize everything its just 
thats the way it evolved flaherty says 
if they can composer and lyricist work together five days a 
week usually three or four hours a day in either ahrens greenwich 
village apartment or flahertys tiny east side studio 
their newest project musical no 6 is my favorite year 
based on the peter otoole movie about a drunken movie star and the 
young writer hired to keep him out of trouble 
act 1 is complete as are parts of the second act the book is 
by joseph dougherty writer of televisions thirtysomething 
eventually the team hopes to have a reading of the show perhaps 
at playwrights horizons and then maybe shop it around to a 
regional theater before braving new york again 
its a big musical with 12 principal roles says flaherty 
its got a real brassy 50s sound to it its so much fun 
the show is what musicals used to be like sighs ahrens 
it really belongs on broadway

eep the henry clay hotel 
alive 
thats how funerals help k bad business is at the 14room hotel that 
alma 
jarretts parents bought in their hometown 25 years ago 
most of the henry clays guests arent staying for pleasure 
some of them are motorists who just got lost 
usually the people who come in here are coming to do some kind 
of job or theyre here for a funeral mrs jarrett says 
the story is the same at thousands of small independent hotels 
and motels across the land they are being choked out by the big 
franchised operations 
the momandpops are dying says frank torres franchise 
coordinator of econo lodges of america based in charlotte nc 
you have a lot of independents that are feeling the pressure it 
might be a goodlooking pro 1988 
citing iranian terrorism and subversion the saudis were one of 
iraqs main backers in the iraniraq war 
the meeting apparently did not go much beyond both sides 
spelling out their positions but it was the most positive sign yet 
that the two countries may be moving toward a rapprochement amid 
the political upheaval triggered by iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
the meeting apparently came out of a mediation effort by syrian 
president hafez assad irans key arab ally and longtime rival of 
iraqs saddam hussein 
assad who is now also allied with the united states and saudi 
arabia against iraq visited tehran for the first time last month 
he apparently encouraged iranian president hashemi rafsanjani to 
speed up efforts to end the feud with riyadh 
healing the rift would help draw iran into the antiiraq camp 
and intensify saddams isolation at a time when unimposed 
sanctions are believed to be having an impact and a usled 
multinational force is growing mightier by the day 
an iransaudi rapprochement would be a major setback for saddam 
not only in his efforts to rally moslems to his cause but by 
perhaps causing iran to seal its long border with iraq making 
sanctions more effective 
saddam has been courting iran in efforts to puncture the un 
embargo 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists is keen to 
end irans isolation and restore relations with the west and gulf 
states 
rafsanjani faces powerful antiwestern radicals at home who 
favor helping iraq confront the swelling multinational military 
buildup in saudi arabia 
but the diplomatic and economic gains iran has garnered since 
the gulf crisis erupted has helped strengthen rafsanjanis hand 
irna gave no timetable for a rapprochement but it quoted saud 
as saying his country is eager to resolve the issue of how many 
pilgrims iran can send to mecca islams holiest shrine before the 
next pilgrimage season that starts in june 
irna quoted velayati as telling saud that the main stumbling 
block for resuming relations is the pilgrimage dispute 
prince saud promised that his government will do its best so 
that iranian moslems perform their rituals in a suitable manner 
the agency said 
in 1987 more than 400 people most of them iranian pilgrims 
were killed in what the saudis said were iranianinspired riots in 
mecca birthplace of the prophet mohammed islams founder 
the following year the saudis announced a quota system that 
restricted the number of pilgrims to 1000 for every 1 million 
citizens of moslem countries 
the iranians protested the move which would have cut their 
contingent from 150000 to around 55000 they have boycotted the 
pilgrimage since then 
irna said velayati stressed that tehran is strongly opposed to 
the presence of foreign forces in the persian gulf and especially 
holy lands in saudi arabia 
however the iranians have also condemned saddams invasion of 
kuwait and blamed him for bringing usled western forces back 
into the gulf

the nations manufacturing economy last month 
hit its lowest level since the end of the previous recession in 
late 1982 according to a key business survey released monday 
the third straight monthly drop in the national association of 
purchasing management index provided more evidence of an imminent 
recession and reflected increased prices from the persian gulf 
crisis 
the group said its indexes for production new orders imports 
inventories and employment all dropped sharply last month 
meanwhile its price index shot up to its highest level since 
september 1988 
coupled with sharply rising prices for petroleumrelated 
products spawned by the middle east crisis the immediate outlook 
appears to be the worst of all combinations a declining economy 
with rising inflation said robert j bretz chairman of the 
groups business survey committee 
the groups purchasing managers index which tracks overall 
business activity at 300 industrial companies fell to 444 
percent down sharply from 470 percent in august a reading below 
50 indicates the manufacturing economy is declining 
septembers reading was the lowest since 428 percent in 
december 1982 the first month of the current economic expansion 
the index stood at 460 percent a year ago 
in other economic news the government reported that 
construction spending stalled in august after posting its first 
gain in four months in july sagging consumer confidence and the 
gulf crisis were to blame analysts said 
a real estate trade group said the average american familys 
ability to buy a home improved in august thanks to a combination 
of falling prices lower mortgage rates and rising incomes but the 
national association of realtors said the improvement was curtailed 
by the gulf crisis and the general weakness of the economy 
the purchasing management report although grim helped spark a 
rally in the stock market coupled with the longawaited federal 
budget accord announced over the weekend the report raised hopes 
that the federal reserve would finally allow interest rates to 
decline 
david wyss chief economist with drimcgraw hill inc in 
lexington mass said the purchasing management figures were not 
surprising because the manufacturing sector has been slumping for 
more than a year but he added that right now were looking for 
evidence of recession and this is certainly one more bit 
the manufacturing sector has been in what some economists label 
a recession because of a decline in consumer purchases of durable 
goods such as automobiles a slowdown in nondefense capital goods 
purchases and a decline in defense spending 
new orders by companies fell for the third straight month to 
445 percent from 464 percent in august the lowest level since 
november 1982 at the trough of the recession 
thirty percent of those businesses surveyed said their new 
orders declined from august while 23 percent said they were better 
and 47 percent unchanged 
the groups production index fell to 451 percent from 485 
percent in august its lowest level since december 1982 a total of 
29 percent of those surveyed said production declined while 23 
percent said it increased and 48 percent reported no change 
the imports index fell to 455 percent from 475 percent its 
lowest level in nine months new export orders though increased 
for the 33rd straight month with the index up to 540 percent from 
530 percent 
but wyss said even the exports sector is likely to be pinched in 
the coming months now with the oil shock hitting the rest of the 
world too that is likely to be slowing down he said 
inventories declined in septmeber for the 22nd straight month 
while supplier deliveries were slightly faster indicating a 
declining economy 
prices shot up with 50 percent of those surveyed reporting 
increases against just 6 percent reporting decreases the price 
index leaped to 734 percent in septemer from 582 percent in 
august the biggest onemonth gain since august 1975 
meanwhile the groups employment index declined for the 19th 
straight month at its greatest rate in five years adding to the 
sectors woes 
the group said purchasers were concerned suppliers would use 
uncertainty from the middle east crisis to raise prices more even 
when increases are not warranted 
in a special question on capital spending plans for the next six 
to 12 months 88 percent of respondents said their plans had not 
changed because of the gulf standoff 8 percent said they were 
revised downward and 4 percent revised upward 
of the 69 percent of respondents who said they had requested new 
or additional credit since june 965 percent said they had 
encounted no difficulty and 35 percent reported tightened lending 
conditions

the stock market staged a strong rally today 
encouraged by falling oil prices and hopes for lower interest 
rates 
a monthly report on the economy from the national association of 
purchasing management coupled with the longawaited federal budget 
accord announced over the weekend raised hopes that the federal 
reserve would finally allow interest rates to decline 
alan greenspan the feds chairman has said the approval of a 
deficit cutting agreement would give the nations central bank more 
leeway in allowing rates to drop 
the purchasing managers report meanwhile provided further 
evidence of a weakening manufacturing economy the purchasing 
managers monthly index fell sharply in september for its third 
consecutive drop 
the market expected the report to put further pressure on the 
fed to lower rates as a means of stimulating the economy 
stocks also got some help from a drop in oil prices crude oil 
for november delivery fell more than 3 a barrel to just above 36 
a barrel in new york mercantile exchange trading

oil minister hisham nazer expressed 
concern about spiraling oil prices on monday and said saudi arabia 
would continue to increase production 
the kingdom has raised its own output by more than 2 million 
barrels per day to help remedy the situation and will increase 
its output at close intervals in the near future nazer was 
quoted as saying before the weekly session of the saudi government 
chaired by king fahd 
there is no need whatsoever for panic to spread in the market 
since consumption in the fourth quarter of the year is estimated at 
545 million barrels per day with various sources capable of 
providing 53 million barrels per day information minister ali 
alshaer quoted nazer as saying in a report on the cabinet session 
to the saudi press agency 
the remainder would be no more than 15 million barrels per 
day or 2 million at most and that can be withdrawn from the 
commercial stockpiles which are estimated at 700 million barrels at 
present nazer said 
since iraq invaded kuwait the price of oil has reached as high 
as 41 dollars a barrel for brent crude and 37 for dubai crude 
nazer warned that the effects of such increases if they continue 
to escalate will be grave for both developing as well as 
industrialized countries 
he recalled the special meeting of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries at the outset of the gulf crisis when prices 
were 2750 per barrel for brent and 25 for dubai 
it was a price far beyond what the market could absorb 
economically or be borne by the developing nations he said 
with the aug 2 invasion the market suffered a shortfall of 45 
million barrels per day that the two countries used to export 
nazer noted that saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter 
had raised its oil by more than 2 million barrels a day 
the kingdom is using the best industrialized techniques in its 
production he said and will increase that output at close 
intervals in the near future without affecting its oil fields 
the statement was an apparent denial of reports that saudi 
arabia might not be able to maintain its output of 75 million 
barrels per day because of technical difficulties

workers at general motors overwhelmingly ratified 
a new threeyear contract the united auto workers union announced 
monday union and company officials said the next round of talks 
would shift to ford 
uaw president owen bieber plans to resume negotiations tuesday 
with ford motor co which had been placed on hold for over a month 
during the general motors corp talks 
we want to get on with this thing ford spokesman dick routh 
said monday 
negotiations between the union and ford had been stalled since 
aug 28 when the uaw chose to focus its attention on gm the new 
gmuaw pact was approved by 86032 votes in favor to 21461 
opposed the union said in a statement monday less than 36 percent 
of the approximately 300000 eligible uaw members cast ballots 
during elections last week and sunday 
about 100000 active ford employees are covered under the 
existing contract that technically expired at midnight sept 14 
contract provisions at all three auto makers were extended while 
bargaining continued in all more that 450000 active auto workers 
are covered by the three contracts 
this agreement will serve as an excellent pattern for new 
contracts at ford and chrysler bieber and vice president stephen 
yokich in charge of the unions gm department said in a joint 
statement 
there are a few provisions of the gmuaw agreement that will be 
troublesome to ford including new premiums on overtime work but 
its expected that an agreement nearly parallel to the gm deal will 
be signed by ford 
the gm agreement contains three years of income guarantees for 
workers laid off because of slumping car and truck sales gm has 
said it would spend up to 41 billion on incomeguarantee programs 
in the new contact compared with about 13 billion in the 1987 
agreement 
various estimates put the cost of similar guarantees for ford 
workers at about 14 billion 
the gmuaw agreement also calls for a 3 percent increase in the 
base wage in the first year and lumpsum payments equal to 3 
percent in the second and third years cost of living adjustments 
on wages were continued from the previous contract negotiated in 
1987 
barring unforeseen complications its expected that negotiators 
will be able to present a tentative agreement to ford workers 
within two weeks 
the story may be different when intensive bargaining resumes 
with chrysler after a ford agreement is reached chrysler officials 
have called uawgm agreement very expensive 
chrysler by far is in the worst financial shape of the big 
three later this month its expected to report a substantial loss 
of 200 million or more for the third quarter

around washington legislators lobbyists and 
public interest groups looked monday at the plan to cut government 
spending with the foreboding of a motorist receiving his mechanics 
estimate 
they knew it would be costly but not exactly how costly 
the 500 billion dent the government plans to make in its red 
ink the next five years will trickle up from many streams small and 
large from a nickel from each gallon of gasoline at first to an 
added 570 a month for medicare from 134 billion in new taxes 
and fees to a 182 billion cutback in defense and domestic 
programs 
it starts with 40 billion in cutbacks the first year 
the broad targets are there but the details will have to be 
worked out 
heres a quick look at some of the prospects 
medicare 
the federal health care program for 33 million elderly and 
disabled americans would take the largest hit of any of the 
entitlement programs with a hopedfor reduction of 60 billion 
about half would come from recipients whose 2860 monthly 
premium for doctors care would increase to 3430 next year and 
whose 75 deductible on doctors bills would double by 1995 
the other half would come from cutting back on reimbursements to 
hospitals and physicians 
the 145 percent tax that helps support the medicare program 
would rise from the first 51300 of income to the first 73000 
groups representing the elderly cried foul arthur flemming 
head of the save our social security coalition said it was 
indefensible that the summiteers put half the revenue burden on 
medicare 
president bush and the budget summiteers are asking one eighth 
of the population to shoulder onehalf of the cuts in domestic 
spending and that eighth represents the oldest the sickest the 
poorest adults those least able to pay said ron pollack 
director of families usa 
agriculture 
house and senate agriculture committee leaders spent monday 
conferring with staff over how to cut 13 billion from agriculture 
programs without seriously damaging farmers income 
republican leader bob dole of kansas was said to insist on 
acrosstheboard cuts so no single commodity gets hurt worse than 
others 
crops protected by government price supports are wheat rice 
cotton and feed grains if market prices fall below the target 
price set by congress the government makes up the difference with 
a direct payment to the farmer 
the 1990 farm bill being worked out in a housesenate conference 
committee calls for 54 billion in spending on such subsidies over 
the next five years 
however under the budget agreement that figure must be cut 25 
percent 
we dont want to see target prices dropped but wed rather 
see target prices go down than loan rates go up said don lipton 
director of media relations for the american farm bureau 
federation 
loan rates are a method of helping farmers who sell abroad a 
big moneymaking enterprise for american farmers 
leland swenson president of national farmers union said the 
13 billion slash in usda programs would throw the farm sector 
into a tailspin 
post office 
postmaster general anthony frank says the price of stamps will 
go up more and sooner than had been planned because the budget 
agreement calls on the postal service to absorb some 5 billion 
over the next five years 
postage rates will be as much as 5 cents higher by 1995 than 
they otherwise would have been frank said there already is an 
increase scheduled for next february expected to raise the price 
of a first class stamp to 30 cents 
this is a conscious decision to shift obligations from the 
treasury to the postal service and has been characterized by many 
as a stamp tax clearly it is said frank

exxon corp and its shipping subsidiary 
have filed notices of claims against the us coast guard totalling 
more than 2 billion in connection with the exxon valdez shipwreck 
exxon spokesman les rogers said the sept 21 filings satisfy an 
administrative requirement that preserves options for exxon and 
exxon shipping co to sue the coast guard over the spill 
exxon has said it has spent more than 2 billion for both its 
cleanup efforts and payments to fishermen and related businesses 
for losses related to the spill 
the claimants allege the coast guard is wholly or partially 
liable for costs exxon incurred in cleaning up the spill and for 
amounts paid to parties in settlement of claims as well as for 
future costs expected to be incurred by exxon as a result of 
pending litigation said coast guard cmdr john mcelwain 
exxon declined to offer an explanation for why company officials 
think the coast guard should share responsibility for the march 24 
1989 oil spill that dumped nearly 11 million gallons of crude into 
prince william sound 
but in the past exxon has claimed that the cleanup was hindered 
by cleanup authorities refusal to give it blanket permission to 
use dispersants in the first three days after the spill the coast 
guard was involved in the decision exxon has said broader use of 
the chemical would have kept more oil off the shores of the sound 
were trying to evaluate the claims against the coast guard 
to see if they have any basis in admiralty law mcelwain said 
some 200 civil lawsuits involving thousands of plaintiffs have 
been filed against exxon mostly in state court in alaska 
plaintiffs include the state residents of villages in the 
spills path fishermen fish processors tourism companies 
fishing lodges and some of the nations largest environmental

gold prices fell nearly 16 an ounce monday 
following the price of oil lower on a belief of better prospects 
for a negotiated settlement to the middle east crisis 
an agreement on a us deficitreduction package sent the dollar 
lower against major foreign currencies traders said the package 
heralded a move to lower interest rates soon by the federal 
reserve 
lower us interest rates would make dollardenominated 
investments less attractive to foreigners seeking high yields 
the decline in gold prices in new york followed sharp drops in 
asia and europe which reacted to weekened reports that iraqi 
president saddam hussein might be willing to negotiate with kuwait 
over his occupation of the persian gulf nation 
on the new york commodity exchange gold bullion for october

gold futures prices have mirrored the rise and fall of oil 
futures since iraqs takeover of kuwait on aug 2 the pattern held 
monday as light sweet crude dropped 242 to 3709 a barrel for 
november delivery on the new york mercantile exchange 
higher oil prices increase inflation which tends to push 
investors to gold which is seen as stable in times of economic 
turmoil the us budget accord also helped to push down gold 
traders said

former treasury secretary donald t regan said 
monday the savings and loan industry would have plunged into the 
tank deeper and faster without the deregulatory policies of the 
reagan administration 
absolutely not regan replied when asked by rep chalmers 
wylie rohio if the thrift debacle discredited deregulation 
regan appeared before the house banking committee in the first of a 
series of hearings examining the causes of the sampl mess 
when you see the eastern european countries coming over 
here to find out how did we do it you have to say our policies 
were correct and deregulation was one of them said regan who 
served as treasury secretary from 1981 to 1985 when he became 
white house chief of staff 
regan said that after interest rates soared in the 1980s a 
result he said of the economic policies of the carter 
administration it became clear that a financial business confined 
to taking deposits from savers and lending the money to home buyers 
could not survive 
he said he had favored giving thrifts the same investment powers 
as commercial banks but had opposed the broader deregulation in 
some states that had given thrifts nonbank powers 
if not for the administrationbacked banking deregulation bill 
of 1982 i think the thrift industry would have gone into the 
tank sooner and may have never emerged he said 
regan who was chairman of merrill lynch before becoming 
treasury secretary was described as the father of brokered 
deposits by rep joseph kennedy dmass 
such highinterest deposits placed by wall street brokerage 
houses usually in amounts just under the 100000 deposit 
insurance limit are blamed for fueling the explosive growth in 
risky investments at many sampls 
regan however said he had recused himself from any policy 
matters affecting brokered deposits because of his connection to 
merrill lynch and said the firm did not deal in them extensively 
until after he left 
i want a blood test as far as being the father of brokered 
deposits i am not in no way shape or fashion he said 
kennedy countered that regan allowed his subordinate deputy 
treasury secretary rt mcnamar to forcefully advocate their use 
regan blamed the explosion of brokered deposits on congress 
1980 decision to raise the deposit insurance limit from 40000 per 
account to 100000 as a reform he advocated forcing depositors 
to pay for their own deposit insurance on amounts over 100000 
edwin gray the nations top thrift regulator from 1983 to 1987 
has accused regan of trying to force him from office when he tried 
to rein in the industry in general and brokered deposits in 
particular 
regan who previously had not had a chance to reply to gray in a 
public forum described him as an absentee lax regulator 
in 1985 when i became chief of staff i began to hear rumors 
that this man was not paying attention he was part of the problem 
not the solution he was sort of a front for the industry i 
didnt like that regan said 
he sid that between september 1983 and june 1986 gray was in 
his office only 397 weekdays and absent 466 days he also noted 
that gray was forced to repay his agency the federal home loan 
bank board 26000 for travel and entertainment 
he want to pebble beach he went to greenbriar my crack was 
i think hes working more on his handicap than hes working on the 
thrifts regan said adding later this guy gets religion when 
hes found out 
gray and former federal reserve board chairman paul volcker are 
scheduled to appear before the committee wednesday the committee 
chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas plans to hear from 
carter administration officials later richard t pratt grays 
predecessor at the bank board from 1981 to 1983 testified after 
regan 
pratt said he was rejected by congress and the reagan 
administration in his attempts to get money to pay for more sampl 
examiners regan he said would not take his calls 
pratt also defended his decision early in the sampl crisis to 
permit thrifts to use accounting techniques to hide their losses 
otherwise it would have cost 178 billion 350 billion in 1990 
dollars to liquidate insolvent thrifts he said 
pratt said when he took office nearly every sampl in the nation 
was technically insolvent because soaring interest rates had 
drastically cut the value of their lowinterest fixedrate 
mortgages regulators strategy was to close the worst institutions 
and to buy time for the others until interest rates fell as they 
did he said

was unqualified

the supreme court on monday agreed to decide 
whether workers who accuse employers of violating a federal law 
against age discrimination sometimes may be forced to submit their 
case to arbitration 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by a north carolina 
man fired at age 62 by a securities firm 
robert gilmer was fired in 1987 as manager of financial services 
for interstatejohnson lane corp and was replaced by a 28yearold 
who gilmer said was less qualified 
six years earlier when he was hired gilmer signed a 
registration form as a securities representative with the new york 
stock exchange in which he agreed to submit any dispute between 
himself and his employer to arbitration 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled in february that the 
arbitration agreement is binding 
gilmer said the agreement violates the federal age 
discrimination in employment act 
but the 4th circuit court said nothing in the law forbids 
arbitration congress clearly did not intend that all adea 
disputes be resolved in federal court the appeals court said it 
also noted that the supreme court in recent rulings has endorsed 
arbitration as an alternative to lawsuits in some cases 
the case is gilmer vs interstatejohnson lane 9018

two of the nations big three automakers said 
monday a deficitreduction proposal that includes a hefty 
gasolinetax increase is difficult but good for the country 
the nation needs a meaningful budgetreduction package said 
susan shackson ford motor cos director of public policy 
development is this the best one probably not but we are where 
we are i would say at this point lets get on with it 
congressional and administration negotiators reached an 
agreement sunday which would if enacted boost the federal 
gasoline tax by next july to 21 cents a gallon from the current 9 
cents 
it also would impose a 10 percent tax on new cars that cost more 
than 30000 
on the positive side shackson and chrysler corp chairman lee 
iacocca said the proposal was likely to be accompanied by 
interestrate reductions 
this budget package gives federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan the tools to make sure we get them iacocca said in a 
statement 
general motors corp spokesman bill noack said company officials 
were reviewing the proposal in the past gm has opposed any gas 
tax increase earmarked for deficit reduction 
we have said we thought a gasoline tax used in that way would 
be a regressive tax and would be disproportionately burdensome on 
lowincome families he said and there are americans who drive 
long distances and for those people it would be difficult 
the threestep boost in the gas tax 5 cents on dec 1 2 cents 
jan 1 and another nickel on july 1 1991 couldnt have come at a 
worst time for the auto industry 
oil prices have been creeping up ever since iraq invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 today gasoline prices are about 30 percent higher than 
before the invasion 
so far automakers have insisted that consumers arent turning 
toward smaller more fuelefficient cars and away from large 
gasgulping cars and trucks 
but evidence of a change may show up wednesday when the 
companies report september car and light truck sales figures its 
expected the downward trend sales have shown since the first of the 
year will continue 
the degree of decline may indicate if consumers are beginning to 
take a waitandsee approach to purchasing a new car or truck 
through sept 20 of this year the big three have sold 7196364 
north americanmade cars and trucks 8 percent lower than sales 
during the same time last year

electric boat gave layoff notices monday to 
582 employees at its groton and quonset point ri plants citing 
declining military orders and uncertainty about federal defense 
expenditures 
the layoffs mainly of support personnel represent less than 3 
percent of the total work force of electric boat a division of 
general dynamics corp but company officials said as many as 5 
percent could receive layoff notices by november 
how many people were going to lay off in the end will depend 
on the defense budget it could be up to 1000 but it wont be 
more than the 4 percent to 5 percent weve announced said neil 
ruenzel a spokesman for the submarine builder 
of the employees laid off monday 415 are salaried staff and 167 
are hourly ruenzel said 
most of the layoffs occurred in groton where 17000 are 
employed about 110 of those getting notices work at the rhode 
island plant which employs about 5000 
a few workers are also being laid off at eb satellite locations 
in such places as avenel nj and charleston sc ruenzel said 
this will affect primarily overhead and support personnel 
people in areas like financial management purchasing and materials 
control and few of the men and women actually involved in 
building the submarines ruenzel said we may have fewer orders 
now but we still have to build the ships 
employees in all departments of the groton plant milled around 
nervously monday during breaks many of them reading and rereading 
an announcement distributed all over the plant that morning in the 
companys employee bulletin 
the company said employees were being notified on a oneonone 
basis by their supervisors 
employees laid off monday will lose their jobs 60 days later 
ruenzel said in the meantime the companys new career transition 
center will help laidoff employees think through their options 
manage their stress and work on brushing up resume and interview 
skills 
but to many of those who woke up monday uncertain whether they 
would come home at the end of their shifts with or without their 
jobs the center is little comfort 
its like propaganda first they take away your job then they 
say they want to help said one employee of the nuclear 
department who asked that his name not be used it doesnt help 
much to work on your job skills when the only job youre likely to 
get has just been taken away from you

treasury bond prices surged monday as the market 
cheered a sharp drop in oil prices and the federal budget accord 
reached by congress and president bush over the weekend 
the bond market was kind of deluged with good news today 
said susan hering a treasury bond economist at salomon brothers 
inc 
the widely watched 30year treasury bond rose 1 132 point or 
1032 for every 1000 in face amount its yield which falls when 
the price rises dropped to 884 percent from 894 percent late 
friday it was the lowest yield for the long bond in about six 
weeks 
bond prices usually rise on signs that inflation may be easing 
one such signal is a drop in oil prices which bonds have tracked 
closely since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the november contract for oil dropped 242 a barrel to 3709 
on the new york mercantile exchange the secondlargest price drop 
since the start of the persian gulf crisis 
oil prices were influenced by a weekend statement from iraqi 
president saddam hussein that appeared to ease tensions in the 
middle east and by comments from bush who told the un general 
assembly on monday that he hoped there could be a diplomatic 
solution to the mideast turmoil 
meanwhile the bond market was encouraged by the accord on the 
fiscal 1991 federal budget the market has looked to the federal 
reserve to ease interest rates after the budget was resolved lower 
rates benefit fixedrate securities such as bonds 
william v sullivan director of money market research for dean 
witter reynolds inc attributed the sharp runup in bond prices to 
onethird budget twothirds oil 
it wasnt until the sharp plunge in oil following bushs 
united nations address that the bond market reenergized itself 
he said 
bond prices also were supported by another signal of growing 
weakness in the economy the nations corporate purchasing managers 
announced that their widely watched monthly index of industrial 
activity dropped for the third straight month to its lowest level 
in nearly eight years 
signs of economic sluggishness often are viewed favorably by 
bond investors because they may cause the fed to ease interest 
rates 
but ms hering wasnt optimistic that bond prices would retain 
their newfound strength she said the market remains tied to iraq 
and its effect on oil prices 
also monday the treasury sold at auction 92 billion in 
threemonth bills at an average discount rate of 718 percent and 
92 billion in sixmonth bills at an average discount rate of 721 
percent 
the rates were the lowest since threemonth bills sold for 717 
percent on sept 19 1988 and sixmonth bills averaged 719 
percent on aug 6 1990 
in the secondary market for treasury securities shortterm 
issues gained 332 point to 316 point intermediate maturities 
rose 1132 point to 1316 point and longterm issues jumped 2932 
point to 1 132 point according to telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer advanced 361 to 115016 
yields on threemonth treasury bills were unchanged at 734 
percent as the discount remained at 712 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell marginally to at 7504 percent as the discount 
remained at 715 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 761 
percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 711 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest banks charge one another 
for overnight loans was quoted at 8 percent up from 8 percent 
late friday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose rsqb point to 88 1932 the average yield 
to maturity fell to 778 percent from 779 percent late friday

ralph nader said monday he would consider suing 
forbes magazine if it doesnt respond within a week to his request 
to retract a highly critical cover story on the consumer activist 
nader in an interview called the story in the sept 17 issue 
of the biweekly business magazine on the low order of 
journalism 
they didnt do their homework he said claiming the article 
contains deeprooted error 
almost every derogatory statement is wrapped around a false 
statement he continued 
theyre used to going after people who have skeletons in their 
closet he said they picked on the wrong crowd this time by 
the time we get through with forbes magazine there will be a case 
study for journalism schools 
nader said he would consider filing a suit seeking a retraction 
if the magazine doesnt voluntarily print one 
the story claims that although nader portrays himself as an 
independent activist free of outside influence he in fact 
represents the interests of trial lawyers who sue companies in 
productliability cases and take other legal actions against 
companies 
in turn these lawyers contribute financially to naders 
organizations forbes claims 
the article also claims that one of naders groups the center 
for study of responsive law founded in 1968 has never made 
required tax filings with the internal revenue service 
in addition forbes wrote that though nader says he lives a 
spartan life in a simple room near his washington dc 
office he actually lives in an expensive townhouse that is owned 
by his sister 
forbes editor james michaels said the magazine stands by its 
story 
at this point and were making a very careful check we dont 
see that theres anything to retract he said 
he said the magazine also hasnt decided whether it would print 
a letter from nader rebutting the article its a very abusive 
letter michaels said

a sigh of relief sounded on wall street monday 
after the bush administration and leaders of congress finally 
compromised on a budget but the best thing many observers could 
say of the accord was that it exists 
i think the financial markets are grateful that the issue is 
going to be put behind us for a while said david h resler 
chief economist at nomura securities international inc 
regardless of whether people like or dislike the compromise 
there is some feeling that an albatross has been removed from 
around the markets neck 
a stalemate in the negotiations over a package of tax increases 
and spending cuts had added to the worries weighing down the stock 
market in recent weeks markets welcomed the break in the deadlock 
as a sign that interest rates could be header lower 
the dow jones industrial average climbed 6336 points closing 
at 251584 amid hopes that the budget accord will make the 
federal reserve more likely to relax its monetary policy in the 
credit market the benchmark 30year treasury bond gained 1lsqb point 
or 1125 for each 1000 in face value 
assuming that congress enacts most of what has been cobbled 
together by white house and congressional negotiators the most 
crucial question about the new 1991 budget proposal can only be 
answered over time will the higher taxes and spending reductions 
hit the economy too hard 
to the extent one can see through the smoke and mirrors i 
dont think it will harm the economy as it sinks into recession 
said manufacturers hanover trust cos chief economist irwin 
kellner in the shortterm it probably isnt enough fiscal 
restraint to push the economy down any more than its going on its 
own 
brian j fabbri chief economist at midland montagu said there 
is a danger however that the 1991 budget could be viewed in 
history as maybe the most illtimed fiscal response ever 
with the economy entering or already in recession this year 
might be the wrong time to enact measures that further discourage 
consumer spending 
a report released monday by the national association of 
purchasing management furnished fresh evidence of economic 
problems the groups index that tracks the manufacturing sector 
sank in september to the lowest level since the cusp of the last 
recession eight years ago 
imposing heavier taxes on alcohol tobacco and gasoline will 
take money out of peoples pockets meaning there will be less 
income available for discretionary purchases of other items fabbri 
said 
richard b hoey chief economist at barclays de zoete wedd inc 
said he expects the fed will ease policy slightly soon nudging 
down shortterm interest rates by about percentage point if the 
economy continues to deteriorate the central bank might have to 
ease again later 
the fed might wait to act until after congress completes the 
ratification process and the budget is a done deal a few weeks from 
now 
no matter what the fed does or when it does it interest rates 
probably will sink resler said rates will go down as credit demand 
shrinks because the economy is crumbling beneath our feet 
the deficitcutting blueprint isnt without merit which even 
cynical wall street insiders were willing to concede 
fabbri of midland montagu said the plan is based on fewer phoney 
economic estimates and less accounting gimmickry than past budgets 
because it includes some genuine tax hikes and spending cuts the 
administration also owned up to more realistic projections 
for kellner of manufacturers hanover the white house and 
congress appear headed on a proper course 
it is encouraging for the moment it seems to be one tiny 
step in the right direction he said im sure glad that they 
reached some semblance of an agreement instead of not reaching one 
at all

three veteran executives at turner broadcasting 
system inc were promoted but they said company chairman ted 
turner while less of a daytoday presence remains at the 
controls of the cable television empire 
this doesnt change teds role at all hes still extremely 
pervasive but there are some areas he doesnt need to be involved 
in day to day said terence f mcguirk who was promoted from 
president of turner sports to executive vice president of tbs 
mcguirk who has been with turner since 1972 will retain his 
position as head of the tbs sports division

companys cable affiliate in 1981 
mcguirk told reporters in a conference call that he has worked 
closely with ted turner for many years mcguirk said there would be 
no radical changes as a result of the management moves 
the promotions follow a string of defections from the tbs upper 
echelon over the past year including senior executive robert 
wussler and last month entertainment networks president gerry 
hogan 
mcguirk characterized the recent departures as part of the 
natural evolution of the 4500employee company 
were a big and deep company mcguirk said the fact that 
a few people have left i dont follow the story that theres 
any pattern to that

entrepreneurial spirit at tbs in favor of a more conservative 
approach to business 
i dont think that our growth is coming to an end mcguirk 
said i dont think the entrepreneurial spirit will ever go away 
ted sets the tone for that 
sassa said one of his main goals is to usher in the next stage 
of maturity for the turners flagship cable superstation he said 
he wanted to inject some new life into the stations marketing and 
promotions rather than make any significant changes in its

unisys corp on monday unveiled its strategy to 
link its computers with those of competitors saying it would 
provide a method unmatched by ibm digital equipment corp and 
other computer makers 
unisys the nations thirdlargest computer company said its 
integrated information environment would provide software that 
would mask the differences between unisys machines and those of 
other companies so they can be joined in a network 
unisys said it would do this by adhering to the increasingly 
popular open systems strategy in which computers and software 
follow sets of industry standards so they can be used 
interchangably 
its a milestone in the strategy weve been pursuing since 
burroughs and sperry became one said james unruh unisys 
president and chief executive referring to the 1986 merger that 
formed the company 
however unisys plan is similar in many aspects to the 
strategies of other computer companies as they contend with 
computer users who want their machines to operate together no 
matter which brand that means unisys will face tough competition 
they have no choice its a standards world said daniel 
mandresh a computer analyst at merrill lynch amp co but he said 
youve got to capture the customer before the other guy 
as part of its plan announced at a news conference here unisys 
said it would provide a new version of the operating system for its 
mainframe computers operating systems control a computers 
internal functions 
the new mainframe operating system will allow the machines to 
serve as information hubs in networks with other types of 
computers unisys said 
that strategy is similar to a plan announced last month by 
international business machines corp which also said it wants to 
position the mainframe at the center of computer networks that link 
personal computers and midsize machines 
but unisys claims its strategy for linking computers of 
different makes differs from that of ibm and other companies 
because it is not based on the computers themselves but on an 
overlay of software based on industry standards 
the strategy also differs from that of ncr corp which 
announced last month that it would replace its entire computer line 
with models based on industry standards 
in contrast unisys has said it will continue to make its two 
older mainframe lines based on proprietary standards but will 
mesh them with other machines with the new software 
on another matter unruh said the companys directors put great 
thought into their decision last week to eliminate unisys 
quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share the move is designed to 
save cash and help reduce unisys debt he said that 
philosphically unisys wanted to pay stockholders a dividend 
but that it would not resume doing so until the companys 
profitability and capital structure warrant it 
unisys based in blue bell pa has been struggling to return 
to profitability since reporting a 639 million loss last year 
last october it announced it would eliminate more than 8000 jobs 
close plants and refocus its mishmash of product lines inhereted 
from its predecessor companies 
unruh again said the company expected to report a loss for the 
third quarter but that it expected a profit in the fourth quarter

layoffs at a company that supplies meat to 
mcdonalds northeast restaurants is the latest indication that 
americans are looking beyond the burger for fastfood fixes 
analysts said on monday 
the equity group a processor of hamburger patties and steaks 
for mcdonalds gave notice friday to 54 of its 115 employees that 
they would be laid off oct 26 
the layoffs are to let the subsidiary of philadelphiabased 
keystone foods reposition itself for the 1990s said andrew 
kornick vice president and general manager of the plant just north 
of albany 
kornick would not say monday what precipitated the layoffs 
but he told the albany timesunion on friday that the cuts at 
the plant which produces exclusively for mcdonald corp were 
due to a national decline in beef consumption 
mcdonalds northeast regional coordinator terri capatosto 
denied hamburger consumption has fallen she said work at the 
upstate new york plant has been moved to plants in pennsylvania and 
ohio to be closer to beef suppliers in the midwest and southwest 
we are in fact selling more hamburgers this year than last 
by several million pounds she said 
overall sales at mcdonalds have risen 8 percent in the first 
six months of 1990 compared with the first half of last year 
capatosto said she could not say how much of the increase could be 
attributed to hamburger sales 
hugh zurkuhlen an industry analyst with salomon bros in new 
york said the layoffs were the first of their kind he had heard 
about he said they are probably due to the double hit of a 
weak economy and the national decline in beef consumption 
theres no question that beef consumption could have something 
to do with it zurkuhlen said 
restaurant sales in the industry are very very soft and any 
future growth in sales in mcdonalds is not likely to come from 
hamburgers they account for less than 50 percent of sales 
kathy duguid regional marketing supervisor for mcdonalds in 
albany said she could not comment on equitys decision or reveal 
the companys meat patty demand from equity 
the burger once the undisputed king of fast food began facing 
challenges in the 1980s as healthconscious americans switched from 
fatheavy beef to lighter fare fastfood restaurants began 
offering more nonbeef items 
mcdonalds introduced chicken mcnuggets in 1983 salads in 1987 
and a chicken sandwich in 1989 
in may miamibased burger king corp the nations no 2 
fastfood chain after mcdonalds introduced the bk broiler a 
broiled chicken sandwich on an oat bran bun 
cori zywotow director of media relations for the chain said 
the new sandwich has been a tremendous success she said the 
company is selling 1 million bk broilers a day already half as 
much as burger kings flagship sandwich the whopper 
burger king like other fastfood chains does not release a 
breakdown of sales figures 
hardees food systems inc which ranks right behind burger 
king has in the last 18 months introduced a nonfried chicken 
sandwich and the lean 1 advertised as the quarterpound 
hamburger with the least total fat 18 grams in the fastfood 
market 
look at the menus at any of the burger giants and it becomes 
clear that americans are leaning to more lowfat low cholesterol 
items said jerry singer director of public relations for the 
rocky mount ncbased chain 
sales of red meat in the entire industry have been declining 
for the past five years he said white meat has been on the 
increase for the past five years 
james murren an industry analyst with cj lawrence suggested 
that a decline in beef production probably wouldnt be enough in 
itself to cause the layoffs he said he thinks the plant likely 
closed because of reduced overall sales at mcdonalds 
mcdonalds is declining most severely in the northeast he 
said 
michael mueller an analyst with montgomery securities said the 
layoffs also could reflect sales losses mcdonalds has incurred 
since 1988 due to lowerpriced competition and delays in 
diversifying their menu 
a lot of mcdonalds problems are selfinflicted mueller 
said 
zurkuhlen said that although the hamburger will probably never 
regain the dominance it once had it will remain a fastfood anchor 
for the foreseeable future 
hamburgers are always going to be part of mcdonalds as long 
as people are eating them he said
