columbia gas is dropping its request to 
make naturalgas customers pay for costs associated with a visit by 
vice president dan quayle last year 
columbia gas had sought customer reimbursement for 703000 in 
costs related to the promotion of a bus powered by natural gas 
quayle unveiled the bus during a visit to ohio on sept 8 
the change in the companys position came friday a day after 
quayles press secretary said the vice president was sending a 
letter to columbia gas asking that the cost be dropped from a 42 
million rateincrease request pending before state utility 
regulators 
quayle said the companys attempt to recover the costs was 
outrageous 
columbia gas spokesman alan crockett said the companys decision 
to withdraw its request for the reimbursement had nothing to do 
with the vice president 
the company said in a statement certainly we want to assure 
that the many benefits of clean air technologies such as the 
natural gas bus are kept in proper focus the attention that now 
surrounds our request to recover these costs has shifted the focus 
of our original intent in developing this important new 
technology 
quayles press secretary david beckwith said the vice 
president had no idea the bus costs might be passed to gas 
customers beckwith said quayle assumed the utility would absorb 
the costs 
the use of my visit to columbus as an excuse to soak the 
ratepayers is outrageous beckwith quoted quayle as saying 
of the 703000 reimbursement ohio customers were asked to pick 
up 428839 of the bill with the remainder spread among customers 
in kentucky maryland new york and pennsylvania

here are some facts figures and 
theories about venus the planet visited early today by the 
jupiterbound galileo spacecraft 
diameter about 7520 miles or 95 percent as wide as earth and 
sixth largest of the solar systems nine known planets 
mass venus weighs about 82 percent as much as earth 
atmosphere about 96 percent carbon dioxide and most of the rest 
nitrogen but with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and water vapor 
the atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect that 
scientists believe evaporated liquid water long ago 
surface conditions temperature about 900 degrees fahrenheit 
crushing atmospheric pressure 90 times that on earth 
day length venus rotates on its axis very slowly so one day on 
venus equals 243 earth days its rotation is retrograde so the sun 
rises in the west and sets in the east 
year length venus orbits the sun once every 225 earth days 
distance from the sun venus is the second planet from the sun 
orbiting at a distance of 672 million miles it is closer to earth 
than any other planet other than the sun and moon venus is the 
brightest object in earths skies 
moons none 
geology earthbased and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of 
thousands of volcanoes on the venusian lowlands although 
scientists dont yet know if any are active venus also has 
meteorite impact craters and continentlike highlands with towering 
peaks that dwarf earths tallest mountains scientists suspect 
giant plates of rock may move in venus crust in a process vaguely 
like continental drift on earth 
gravity about 89 percent as strong as on earth

here are key events for the galileo 
spacecrafts looping sixyear trip to jupiter the solar systems 
largest planet 
oct 18 1989 galileo is released from the cargo bay of space 
shuttle atlantis then an inertial upper stage booster launches the 
spacecraft on its long voyage 
nov 911 1989 controllers order multiple firings of 
galileos thrusters for the first of about 30 course correction 
maneuvers 
dec 22 1989 thrusters fire again for second course 
correction 
feb 9 1990 galileo swoops near venus for its first gravity 
assist maneuver using the planets gravity to increase the 
spacecrafts speed to help it reach jupiter galileo makes photos 
and measurements of venus storing them on an onboard recorder 
late october 1990 galileo plays back to earth the photos and 
measurements it made near venus 
dec 8 1990 galileo passes within 600 miles of earth making 
photos and measurements during its second gravity assist 
maneuver which will help aim it toward jupiter 
oct 29 1991 the spacecraft swoops within 600 miles of 
asteroid gaspra taking pictures and measurements 
dec 8 1992 galileo zooms about 185 miles above earths 
surface in the third and final gravity assist maneuver needed 
to hurl it toward jupiter 
aug 28 1993 if galileo has adequate propellant supplies it 
passes 600 miles from asteroid ida for photos and measurements 
july 1995 the spacecraft separates into a 760pound galileo 
probe and a 4890pound galileo orbiter both continue toward 
jupiter 
dec 7 1995 the probe and orbiter arrive at jupiter the 
probe plunges into the planets atmosphere relaying measurements 
to the orbiter then is destroyed by intense atmospheric pressure 
the orbiter speeds about 600 miles from the moon io and its 
sulfurspewing volcanoes and geysers then goes into orbit around 
jupiter 
december 1995october 1997 the orbiter circles jupiter making 
photos and measurements of the giant planet and the moons europa

to his lawyer hes johnny to the media the 
dapper don to authorities the gambino crime family boss 
call him what you like but john joseph gotti jr has captured 
the public imagination like no gangster since capone 
his acquittal friday of conspiracy and assault in the shooting 
of a union official only added to his growing aura of 
invincibility which started when predecessor paul castellano was 
gunned down in december 1985 
since that slaying gottis beaten a pair of government cases 
while allegedly running the nations most powerful mob 
organization and he has become americas bestknown crime figure 
his penchant for 1800 suits silk shirts and diamond pinkie 
rings have contributed to his image as a throwback to the mobsters 
of old 
despite continual fbi surveillance gotti keeps a high profile 
making daily trips to hangouts like the bergin hunt and fish club 
in the borough of queens and the ravenite social club in manhattan 
he dines out frequently and enjoys italian food as his stocky 
5foot10 build attests 
phone taps have revealed gotti to be hottempered with a taste 
for gambling many of his friends and reputed crime associates date 
to his childhood one of them is actor ray sharkey who portrayed 
mob boss sonny steelgrave on the television show wiseguy 
sharkey and gotti grew up in the same brooklyn neighborhood 
they ate together at a restaurant recently after they hugged and 
kissed in court 
what do you think defense lawyer bruce cutler is my only 
friend gotti told reporters who expressed surprise 
gotti who turns 50 in october lives with his wife of 29 years 
victoria all agree he is a devoted family man though law 
enforcement officials say the family to whom he is devoted is the 
gambino organization 
in 1979 gotti suffered a family tragedy the death of his 
12yearold son frank who was riding a motorbike when he was 
struck by a neighbors car the accident was a tragedy for the 
neighbor too he disappeared four months later and has never been 
found 
authorities say another death no accident vaulted gotti into 
the position of capo di tutti capi the bold executions of 
castellano and bodyguard thomas bilotti outside a manhattan steak 
house on dec 16 1985 
no one has ever been charged with his murder but within days of 
the castellano hit police detectives reported seeing 100 organized 
crime figures paying their respects to gotti 
since then his lifestyle has been consistent with the 
stereotypical image of a mafia don he travels in a black stretch 
mercedes and he wears his expensive suits with matching ties and 
handkerchiefs 
yet gotti claims he is a salesman for the arc plumbing amp heating 
co of queens his attorney cutler says gotti is nothing more 
than an upfront guy who doesnt fit into their preconceptions of a 
ninetofiver 
so he didnt go to harvard so he gambled a little that makes 
him a mob leader asked cutler the government is very very 
resentful of his popularity jealous of him 
there is no questioning gottis popularity in his queens 
neighborhood he returned like a conquering hero after his 
acquittal on racketeering charges in 1987 during the carpenters 
union assault trial local merchants strung a banner across 101st 
street wishing him luck 
every year he funds a fourth of july street party in queens 
hordes of police have tried to stop the fireworks there to no 
avail 
gotti reputedly earned his mob stripes with the 1973 slaying of 
james mcbratney in a staten island bar he did two years in jail 
for the slaying after pleading guilty to attempted manslaughter in 
a pleabargaining agreement 
during the 1960s gotti was jailed twice one year for grand 
larceny and 3 years for hijacking 
but lately his legal luck has changed his only convictions in 
the past five years are traffic violations with cutlers help he 
beat a massive federal racketeering and conspiracy case 
the dapper don also beat an assault charge when the alleged 
victim after finding out who gotti was testified he was unable 
to identify his attackers i forgotti headlined the new york 
post after the 1986 trial 
the victories apparently convinced gotti he had become the 
teflon don untouchable by the authorities gotti never even 
flinched when dozens of law enforcement officers swooped down to 
arrest him last year for the union shooting 
an unflustered gotti surveyed the situation and said 
threetoone odds i beat this 
once again he was right

the democratic uprisings that have swept 
three continents stunned the world with their apparent suddenness 
but reform leaders say those impressions are misleading 
the struggle for democratic freedoms is always long and never 
easy said li lu a chinese student leader who is on his 
countrys most wanted list and was forced to flee after the 
massacre of protesters in beijing last spring 
nonviolent reform was the focus friday as about 180 political 
leaders scholars and journalists from around the world met for the 
first time to discuss the dramatic changes in recent months from 
the berlin wall to soweto 
everyone here is representative of different movements that 
are constantly in the headlines said roger powers of the 
cambridgebased albert einstein institution sponsor of the 
threeday conference 
our contention is that you cant understand international 
politics today without understanding nonviolent methods because 
those methods are behind the changes going on everywhere around the 
world he said 
leaders and scholars of democratic movements in china south 
africa the soviet union eastern europe and elsewhere spent the 
day exchanging strategies and stories of reform 
one of the principles of nonviolence is to weigh down the 
opponent until you outlast the resistance said patrick lekota a 
leader of the united democratic front of south africa each 
campaign is a springboard for advance 
in south africa he said boycotts strikes and external 
political economic and moral pressure have taken the democratic 
movement a long way toward fundamental reforms 
president fw de klerk made history last week by announcing the 
most sweeping reforms since the countrys apartheid system was put 
in place in 1948 
but lekota said those changes were set in motion long before de 
klerk announced his dramatic initiatives which include the planned 
release of jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela 
and the lifting of a ban on more than 20 outlawed antiapartheid 
groups 
de klerk did not just wake up one day with a heart of gold 
he said it was our steady pressure that took us to the point 
where he could no longer ignore us 
lu who is studying at columbia university said the story in 
china has been somewhat different but the movements impact cannot 
be overlooked and must not be misunderstood 
the goal of the students was to make the people aware of their 
situation lu said the next step is real practical 
change 
such changes could also be spurred by the recent popular 
uprisings across the soviet bloc and radical changes in the soviet 
union where this week the communists voted to end oneparty rule 
lu said 
we have a very conservative dictatorship in china he said 
but they no longer have anywhere to hide the changes are 
everywhere around them 
among the other panelists participating in fridays session were 
raymundas rayatskas one of the founders of lithuanian popular 
front and u tin maung win a leader of the committee for the 
restoration of democracy in burma 
activists said the roads had been long and pitted for 
nonviolent movements that stretch back to the chinese cultural 
revolution of the 1960s the prague spring of 1968 or the soweto 
riots of 1976 
political transformation is seldom swift but the boycotts 
rallies and marches are fired by necessity experts said 
when people are poor their stomachs empty and their minds 
oppressed they have no choice but to use nonviolence as a 
weapon said mubarak awad of the palestinian center for the study 
of nonviolence

andy rooney the humorist suspended from cbs 
news says his troubles came about because gays decided to charge 
me with racism 
rooney said in a column distributed friday that he was uncertain 
about damage done to him by racial comments attributed to him in a 
gay magazine 
rooney who earlier was defended by former cbs news anchor 
walter cronkite also received support friday from fred w 
friendly a former president of cbs news 
rooney was interviewed by chris bull a reporter with the 
advocate a biweekly magazine based in los angeles he was quoted 
as saying that most people are born with equal intelligence but 
blacks have watered down their genes because the less intelligent 
ones are the ones that have the most children they drop out of 
school early do drugs and get pregnant 
i not only deny the quote attributed to me i say the 
quotation was made up by a young reporter who couldnt take 
notes rooney wrote in his column 
bull the reporter said earlier this week that his quotations 
of rooney taken down during a phone interview three weeks ago 
were accurate he did not tape the interview 
rooney planned to continue writing his twiceweekly syndicated 
humor column which he said is distributed to about 260 newspapers 
rooney has worked in news and entertainment at cbs for 40 years 
and has been the resident humorist at 60 minutes since 1978 
he previously got in hot water with gay groups with a remark he 
made in a dec 28 cbs special a year with andy rooney 1989 
in that show he said that many of the ills which kill us are 
selfinduced and then cited too much alcohol too much food 
homosexual unions cigarettes 
in his column distributed friday rooney wrote it is not 
clear yet to me whether i have been destroyed or not but i know 
that a denial from anyone does not carry anywhere near the same 
weight as an accusation the accusation against me came from an 
angry gay organization which had decided that while the media 
might be relatively indifferent to the complaint of gays that they 
has been wronged it is difficult for any news organization to 
stand up against a charge of racism so in their organized 
campaign against me hundreds of letters were addressed to cbs 
national news gays decided to charge me with racism 
now theyre angry because the race issue got me and the 
homosexual issue did not 
for all the hurt to me i am even sorrier for the hurt to 
gays blacks and cbs news none of them needs more trouble 
friendly now director of the columbia university seminars on 
media and society said in defending rooney some of us who have 
known andy rooney for 50 years 48 in my case know that andy is 
blunt in talking the truth if andy rooney said he never said that 
i would believe it

a wizened old man brandishing a plastic 
bag containing six halfbaked loaves of bread shouts 1000 
pounds who pays higher 
1200 said a hungry resident of the christian enclave 
lunging at the bag 
the 250 price tag five times the regular amount enrages the 
other four men bidding for the scarce commodity and they chase the 
auctioneer away with shouts of thief thief 
shelves in the few grocery stories that were open in the furn 
elshubbak and neighboring ein rummaneh residential areas hardhit 
by fighting between rival christian forces were nearly empty 
friday 
hunger drove some residents to brave the sniper fire at the 
crossing point between the christian enclave and the citys moslem 
sector and dozens of pushcart fruit and vegetable vendors did a 
roaring business in the area 
since fighting broke out jan 30 at least 418 people have been 
killed most of them noncombatants almost 1700 have been wounded 
in the worst intrachristian fighting in lebanons 15yearold 
civil war 
the new confrontation lines between renegade gen michel aouns 
19000 troops and christian warlord samir geageas 6000strong 
lebanese forces militia have kept food distributors off the 
streets the troops are battling for control of the christian 
enclave north and northeast of beirut 
tree branches pieces of corrugated tin shrapnel and glass 
shards cover mines planted by the lebanese forces at entrances to 
furn elshubbak and ein rummaneh to block a possible tank thrust by 
aouns troops 
the camouflage is to protect those living in the area from 
inadvertently stepping on a mine while blowing up any tank trying 
to venture forward 
no cars can enter these areas 
pedestrians wave hysterically at civilians driving toward the 
mined strip dont drive any closer and when you walk keep your 
eyes on the ground watch out for suspiciouslooking objects 
lebanese forces militiamen lurking on street corners and toting 
sovietmade ak47 assault rifles prevent reporters and 
photographers from taking pictures without a visit to their 
kassardjian barracks in ein rummaneh for a permit 
the base withstood dozens of tank charges in the past 11 days 
these assaults caused colossal damage in ein rummaneh and furn 
elshubbak because tanks pounded every building that their crewmen 
suspected of harboring militiamen 
tell the general he will have to roll his tanks over our dead 
bodies before he can get into ein rummaneh one lebanese forces 
official said 
militiamen driving a reporter through the area kept the windows 
rolled down but swerved and zigzagged like madmen because aouns 
men are lurking there only a few meters away 
the two areas look as if a hurricane raged through their streets 
nearly every boutique has been gutted clothes lie in shreds on 
pockmarked streets covered with soot debris and metal bars 
the facades of apartment buildings are marred with gaping holes 
ringed with black soot they line narrow nearly deserted alleys 
filled with bulletriddled cars 
dejected civilians in ein rummanehs ghannoum street a 
confrontation line with aouns troops were mopping up water that 
flooded their 12squareyard shelter when a shell burst the water 
tanks 
we had to sleep on soggy mattresses and the alreadycold 
shelter grew colder francis yahshoushi said 
we didnt have any water left except in a few cannisters for 
drinking water we boiled the water we had stored on kerosene 
stoves we nearly choked on the kerosene fumes he added 
a day after the loss of the precious water yahshoushi said a 
shell hit the first floor of the building causing a fire that 
spread to the entrance of the building 
had it not been for the rain all 57 of us would have 
suffocated he said we placed pieces of cloth soaked with 
water on the faces of the children

mexican authorities say they are trying to 
figure out why fewer gray whales than usual are showing up in baja 
california waters to give birth this year 
it will have to be researched said graciela de la garza 
head of conservation for the department of ecology and urban 
development 
marine mammal experts said 2000 whales could be expected to 
enter the lagoons during a normal calving season but mexican 
authorities interviewed thursday and friday said only 12 to 20 
whales have been spotted 
a us group said friday that 40 to 60 whales were spotted in 
recent days at san ignacio one of four bays the whales use for 
breeding 
de la garza said it was the first time such low numbers had been 
observed so late in the season 
however anelio aguayo a marine mammal expert at the national 
university in mexico city cautioned that there are frequently 
transitory variations in the numbers of whales in the different 
lagoons 
we need to wait for the end of the season and then see what 
the outcome is he said 
the whales use the vizcaino biosphere reserve a 6millionacre 
protected zone because high salt content helps pregnant females 
float and give birth said jorge hernandez a marine biologist for 
a committee that oversees the reserve 
they calve in the bays of san ignacio guerrero negro magdalena 
and ojo de liebre or eye of the hare known to whale fans in the 
united states as scammons lagoon 
the whales usually begin arriving in the first week of november 
by april most have left for alaskan waters hernandez said 
but the few that arrived this year didnt start appearing until 
middecember said ulises cesena montano the reserves interagency 
coordinator 
we dont know the reasons there are only hypotheses he 
said 
the group of 100 an ecological group of mexican artists and 
intellectuals has suggested that an industrial salt plant in the 
reserves buffer zone may be damaging water quality or that the 
whales may have been affected by the exxon valdez oil spill in 
alaskan waters last year 
but de la garza and cesena discounted those ideas 
cesena said the prevailing theory is that an unusual cold 
current is keeping the whales away from their accustomed warmwater 
haunts in places the current is less than a mile from land he 
said 
the temperature strength and exact route of the current dubbed 
the corriente de la nina are still being studied and an aerial 
search is being conducted for whales in the pacific hernandez said 
once the cold water is past maybe the whales will appear 
cesena said he said only 20 whales have been spotted so far de la 
garza said the number could be as low as 12 
but mark palmer conservation director of ocean alliance based 
in oakland calif said in a telephone interview that a group of 
whalewatchers sponsored by oceanic society expeditions has observed 
40 to 60 gray whales in the san ignacio lagoon in recent days 
de la garza said the variations are not necessarily cause for 
alarm there can be delays in any species migration she said 
the species was hunted to the verge of extinction but recovered 
substantially after hunting was prohibited following world war i 
palmer said the gray whale population is estimated at 17000 to 
20000 from studies conducted over several years 
he said the varying figures suggest a need for a better survey 
in one part of the lagoons they probably dont have a good 
overall picture palmer said

since 1956 the government has 
charged helen joseph with treason detained her repeatedly placed 
her under house arrest and made it a crime to quote her 
but the 84yearold white antiapartheid activist survived 34 
years of bannings and on feb 2 became one of nearly 500 people 
living and dead whose restrictions were lifted by president fw 
de klerk 
i didnt think id see this day mrs joseph said adding 
that she was a bit disappointed the government no longer considered 
her a threat im a stubborn old bag and i wasnt expecting 
things to change 
police restrictions have been a way of life for many 
antiapartheid activists hundreds detained without charge during 
the 3yearold state of emergency were released but then placed 
under virtual house arrest 
the restrictions varied but often prohibited the activists from 
leaving their neighborhoods required them to be home each night 
prevented them from attending meetings or participating in 
politics and often made it impossible to hold a job 
zwelakhe sisulu son of recently released african national 
congress leader walter sisulu was freed from prison in december 
1988 after two years in detention but he had to report daily to 
police and was unable to resume his job as editor of the new nation 
newspaper until de klerk rescinded his restriction order 
few have endured as much as mrs joseph a former social worker 
and union official now confined to a wheelchair much of the time 
the government charged mrs joseph anc leader nelson mandela 
and more than 150 others with treason in 1956 for their 
antiapartheid activities all were acquitted in a trial that 
lasted until 1961 
however mrs joseph a divorcee with no children remained 
under a banning order and in 1962 became the first south african 
placed under house arrest for the next nine years police were the 
only visitors allowed to enter her comfortable white house with a 
red roof and a flowerfilled garden in a johannesburg suburb 
her house arrest ended in 1971 while she was undergoing a cancer 
operation but until feb 2 she remained a listed person 
meaning she could not be quoted in south africa 
she has been arrested numerous times most recently in 1983 when 
she sang a freedom song and gave a clenchedfist black power 
salute while attending a treason trial 
as part of his reform program de klerk lifted the police orders 
on 374 people who had been restricted after their release from 
detention he also removed the names of all 110 people who had been 
listed and could not be quoted many of the listed people are 
either dead or have left south africa they include 
most of the african national congress leadership such as 
president oliver tambo who is recovering from a stroke in sweden 
donald woods whose book biko about the life and death of 
black activist steve biko was made into a movie cry freedom 
three years ago woods now lives in london 
numerous whites including anne heymann who died of pneumonia 
feb 3 at the age of 66 and her husband isaac heymann who died 
of cancer four days later at the age of 79 
the heymanns both listed since the 1960s lived only a few 
blocks from mrs joseph and often visited her at her front gate 
during the years when she wasnt allowed guests inside her home 
so many people suffered for so many years mrs joseph said 
im not grateful for the lifting of the restrictions it was 
not an act of compassion it never should have been done in the 
first place 
despite failing health she occasionally travels to 
antigovernment protests such as an anc rally last october in the 
township of soweto where she received a rousing cheer from the 
mostly black crowd of 70000 
mrs joseph whose requests to visit mandela were repeatedly 
denied finally was granted permission and the two met last dec 21 
for the first time in 28 years 
he looked different after so many years but then so did i 
mrs joseph said he was in very good form full of jokes full 
of laughter 
four days later mrs joseph had christmas dinner with walter 
sisulu and dozens of other activists at the home of a friend 
after her house arrest was lifted she began a tradition of 
making a toast at noon on christmas to remember all the 
antiapartheid activists who were in exile in prison or had died 
word of the tradition had spread to exiles and prisoners and 
sisulu told mrs joseph it was observed during his years in jail 
she hopes one day all the activists will be able to hold a 
christmas toast together in south africa but she doubts shell be 
around to take part 
i dont think ill see the end of apartheid but ill see it 
diminish she said you cant wash away 300 years of cruelty 
and injustice overnight

gangprevention program called project serve held a drug and 
gang awareness super bowl to honor students who are working to 
end the violence 
and seventhgrader norvell was the showstopper at an assembly 
of the schools 950 students 
you could hear almost a pin drop thats how good it was 
eighthgrade teacher jacqueline cooney said of the girls 
awardwinning speech 
in the speech norvell told her classmates im sick and tired 
of these people coming into our neighborhoods frightening our 
friends and families and putting ideas into our little brothers 
and sisters minds that gangs are cool 
i say the only thing that you can get out of being in a gang 
is a hole in your head or 6 feet under take your choice 
john hope community academy in the citys south side englewood 
neighborhood straddles an invisible line dividing the turf of two 
gangs 
the rules for survival along that boundary are sometimes 
deceptively simple students say 
you dont go to that side of the boulevard and if you do you 
cant wear blue and black you have to wear red and black and wear 
caps to the left explains 12yearold kinisha gaston 
assistant principal jim murray acknowledged that when students 
leave school property they face harassment by gang recruiters 
often high school students 
but murray said the school is making some inroads with the help 
of programs like project serve in which offduty lawenforcement 
officials work to educate students about the dangers of drugs and 
gangs 
our students the vast majority of them do not get involved 
in the gang community he said the children tune in to what is 
being said and they respond positively 
norvell said friday that students who join gangs do so because 
they have low self esteem and want to belong 
she said she was approached two years ago on a day when she 
missed her bus by a group of threatening girl recruiters 
i didnt want to be in a gang norvell said i was 
thinking if i do this im going to be ruined for life ill 
miss out on everything 
she told the girls she wouldnt join the gang a vow she has 
repeated many times since 
since winning the super bowl this week she said several 
gang members have told her they are thinking about her speech 
most students norvell said simply dont want to join a gang 
and go to an early grave

since their communist governments started 
crumbling eastern european filmmakers have found it harder to come 
up with story ideas they dont have their leaders to kick around 
anymore say filmmakers and distributors at the miami film festival 
every good film in eastern europe was an anticommunist 
idea said adrian sarbu chief of the bureau of cinema and 
television for romanias governing national salvation front we 
have good filmmakers now we have to find the ideas 
the fall of the berlin wall and the revolutions against 
hardline communism throughout the region have resulted in a vacuum 
for ideas said sarbu who is attending the film festival which 
opened feb 2 and ends sunday 
before we were kicking the communists because it was popular 
now who are you going to kick asked john gluski of the american 
institute of polish culture in miami and a distributor of polish 
films 
before they didnt have good scripts because of censorship 
now there is no censorship and there are no scripts gluski a 
native of poland said thursday 
the soviet union has been an exception said andrel zinca a 
native of romania now with david productions in miami 
after perestroika and glasnost soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs policies of restructuring and openness soviet 
filmmakers produced some of the best films coming out of europe 
zinca said 
this years polish feature film at the miami festival has a 
familiar antigovernment theme but it was completed prior to 
solidaritys strong showing during free elections in june that 
forced the communists out of power 
the last ferry set in the year 1981 is about a solidarity 
activist carrying important documents to the west aboard a ship 
when martial law is declared by the communists the ferry heads 
back to poland but the passengers jump overboard the film won the 
grand prize at the national film festival in gdansk poland 
another east bloc film at miamis festival was the rise and 
fall of the ceausescu dynasty romanias first and only film 
released since the fall of dictator nicolae ceausescus regime in 
december 
the film graphically depicts the violence from the popular and 
military overthrow with the trial and execution of ceausescu and 
his wife the film nears its end with these animals are no 
longer 
the irony is that romanias first film since the revolution 
features the person romanians would least like to see sarbu said 
romanians were exposed almost exclusively to ceausescu and his 
propaganda for about two hours a day on their nations only 
television station for the last seven years 
sarbu said the films censored by ceausescu will eventually be 
released he expects new films to follow one theme we have to do 
politics in all of eastern europe 
that will require artist in the east bloc to restructure their 
language phraseology and thinking he said we must reinvent the 
language in all forms of art sarbu said thursday 
east bloc countries are not only short of ideas but also money 
polish filmmakers can no longer rely on government subsidies 
gluski said like other east bloc counties financing will have to 
come from their fledgling free markets 
there is no money you have to look for private financing 
gluski said 
gluski said a 5 million usproduced film would cost 500000 
in poland simply because of cheaper labor and other costs 
there are people with talent they have equipment they have 
the artists but they need the financial help to produce it 
gluski said

del shannon who wrote and sang 
anguished rock songs in the 1960s including the hits runaway 
and keep searchin died from an apparent selfinflicted 
gunshot wound he was 55 
shannons wife bonnie leanne found her husbands body 
thursday night in the den of their home 35 miles northwest of los 
angeles sheriffs deputy roger hom said friday 
hom said the death was being investigated as a possible suicide 
los angeles county coroners spokesman bob dambacher said an 
autopsy would be performed over the weekend he said shannon died 
from a 22caliber bullet wound in the head 
it had to be impulsive said his lifelong friend and 
personal manager dan bourgoise in the end he must have felt 
alone all the paranoid things that made him write those songs he 
wrote like runaway i think he just ended up being that lonely 
guy 
he said shannon was nearing completion on a new album with tom 
pettys group the heartbreakers 
im very saddened to have lost a friend petty said in a 
statement del was one of the true greats 
bourgoise said shannon had been depressed recently 
he was disoriented and he was sick and he started to do all 
kinds of worsecase scenarios in his head bourgoise said 
he was lonelier than he should have been with all the friends 
around him bourgoise said he said his friend had fought drugs 
depression and alcoholism as his career faltered but had been 
sober since 1976 
singer bobby vee said he talked with shannon last weekend before 
the two performed in fargo nd at an annual buddy holly memorial 
concert 
vee also said shannon was despondent about going on a british 
tour and his recent move into a new house i didnt realize the 
extent of his pain vee said 
it had been years since shannon who was born charles westover 
in coopersville mich on dec 30 1934 had a hit song or whirled 
around in the popularity frenzy that surrounded him in the 1960s 
in pettys recent hit runnin down a dream he writes about 
listening to the radio while on a drive me and del were singin 
little runaway i was flyin 
in the movie born on the fourth of july tom cruises 
character sings a bit of runaway along with shannons recording

shannon learned to play guitar at 13 entertained in high school 
and after a twoyear stint in the army began playing clubs in his 
home state of michigan an ann arbor disc jockey who heard him set 
up an audition and shannon flew to new york to record runaway 
for big top records 
it was his strong falsetto choruses on his hits including 
hats off to larry that became shannons trademark during the 
height of his career 
with the late roy orbison shannon set a groove for american 
rock in the early 1960s with countryinfluenced pop ballads and 
like orbison he was swept aside by the british music invasion

shannon who had an appearance with the beatles at the royal albert 
hall and was voted by several polls as the most popular male singer 
in britain in 1962 and 1963 
his other top 20 singles included hats off to larry 
little town flirt and keep searchin 
shannon and his wife of 27 years shirley divorced and he 
married the former bonnie leanne gutierrez in 1987 he leaves

the national transportation safety board plans 
to produce its own 10 most wanted recommendations in an effort 
to get government and industry to take more actions to protect 
travelers 
the list will include the top proposals of the board for saving 
lives in air land and sea transportation newly confirmed board 
chairman james l kolstad said friday he said too many board 
recommendations are ignored 
kolstad in an interview acknowledged the fivemember boards 
image has been somewhat tarnished in recent years and promised 
a firm but nonconfrontational approach to public safety 
the ntsb which investigates all plane crashes and other major 
transportation accidents but cannot enforce its recommendations 
has been plagued by a lack of trained investigators a tight 
budget low staff morale and bickering over leadership 
kolstads confirmation by the senate late thursday ended 17 
months of uncertainty for the board 
kolstad who has been acting board chairman since august 1988 
while he and former chairman jim burnett vied for the permanent 
post said he expects his confirmation to end friction on the board 
the chairman said he would work to improve the timeliness 
quality and efficiency of board efforts to ensure safety of the 
nations transportation systems focusing much of its efforts on 
what he said are the nations most pressing safety problems 
instead of shoveling out hundreds of recommendations a year 
and treating all of them the same at least we would have 10 that 
congress the public and industry know are the ones the ntsb feels 
are the most important he said 
kolstad finally moved into burnetts office this week while 
burnett remains on the fiveseat board the senate also confirmed 
former federal railroad administration deputy susan coughlin as the 
newest board member replacing lee dickinson one seat which 
belonged to the late joseph t nall awaits a presidential 
nomination the other board member is john lauber 
the board has not added a new staff position in 4 years 
president bushs requested 309 million budget for fiscal 1991 
would add 22 posts but the independent agency now has fewer 
employees than it had in the late 1970s when there were fewer 
accidents 
still transportation safety has improved over the years 
kolstad said and there are more accidents now because people are 
traveling more 
he defended his leadership style which has been contrasted with 
that of the toughtalking burnett who failed to win senate 
approval when former president reagan nominated him for a fourth 
term as chairman 
my style is to ensure that both the government and the 
industry understand the reason for our recommendations ive 
never felt that its effective to do this through a confrontational 
style kolstad said 
i want to see our recommendations become more realistic and i 
think we can do that with a twoway communication with all segments 
of the transportation industry he said 
but kolstad said he would criticize the federal aviation 
administration or other agencies if necessary and would continue to 
send teams to investigate any safety lapses 
were still going to continue to have a firm oversight and 
were going to call the shots as we see them he said adding 
watch what we do more than what i say

the resignation of a key official in president 
bushs beleaguered savings and loan bureaucracy is worsening fears 
the government may be botching the selling of failed thrifts and 
their repossessed real estate 
daniel p kearney chief staff officer of the resolution trust 
corp oversight board quit friday after complaining the board 
wasnt giving him the authority he needed to do his job 
the resignation is more evidence of the growing disarray in 
the bush administration said rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
chairman of the house banking committee he predicted delay in 
dealing with failed sampls would increase the taxpayer cost of the 
bailout 
economist paul getman of regional financial associates a 
consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa said bureaucratic infighting 
is also heightening concern that an overhang of governmentowned 
real estate will depress property prices in some areas 
it means that if theyre not selling much real estate now 
when they finally get around to selling the glut may be worse than 
people feared he said 
the board said late friday that it was naming william taylor to 
replace kearney on an acting basis the brief statement gave no 
reason for kearneys departure saying only that taylor who is 
head of the federal reserve boards banking regulation division 
would take over immediately at the rtc 
the oversight board created to set policy for government thrift 
rescues is composed of three officials treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady who serves as chairman federal reserve board 
chairman alan greenspan and jack kemp secretary of the department 
of housing and urban development 
the board has a small staff under kearney however the work of 
the bailout is performed by the federal deposit insurance corp an 
independent regulatory agency 
whats happened in a nutshell is that congress has set up an 
organization with responsibilities overnight far larger than 
citicorp the nations largest bank said rep jim leach of iowa 
the senior republican on the banking committee 
recent congressional hearings have focused on the tension 
between the oversight board and the fdic but kearneys resignation 
underscores reported infighting between the treasury department and 
the oversight board staff 
its an awkward structure on top of that treasury has 
played a particularly assertive role of the three institutions 
represented on the board leach said 
kearney did not directly respond to those reports in his 
statement but said his job does not currently afford me the 
authority that i believe is essential to be effective 
the resignation likely will add momentum to a proposal by rep 
bruce vento dminn to disband the oversight board 
kearney faced bureaucratic hurdles that no one could 
overcome said vento who heads a house task force monitoring the 
bailout his resignation only serves to confirm that the 
oversight board should be abolished 
kearney who served at hud and the office of management and 
budget during the ford and nixon administrations was hired as 
oversight board president in october his last job was pension fund 
adviser for aldrich eastman amp waltch inc in boston 
art siddon a treasury spokesman had no immediate comment on 
the resignation 
the rtc has accomplished nothing and has cost taxpayers 
millions of dollars perhaps that is why mr kearney quit said 
rep frank annunzio dill the taxpayers would like to quit 
also but unfortunately that is not possible

a leader of angolas anticommunist rebels 
says the us is assuring his forces will get continued american 
diplomatic and material support 
jeremias chitunda vice president of the unita rebels met with 
under secretary of state robert kimmitt on friday as the group is 
facing perhaps its severest battlefield test in 15 years of 
fighting 
the usbacked unita has been battling a government offensive 
in an area of southeast angola that has been in rebel hands for 
years most of the fighting has been centered on the town of 
mavinga 
we appreciate very much the sensitivity the understanding 
that is manifest here towards the urgency and the seriousness of 
the intensity of the offensive chitunda said in an interview 
he was not specific about the nature of the assistance he was 
promised the state department had no immediate comment on the 
meeting 
on tuesday angolan president jose eduardo dos santos claimed 
victory in the battle for mavinga but chitunda said that statement 
was not true 
us officials have said that government forces control the 
airport but that most of the surrounding area continues to be held 
by unita 
angola is one conflict that has not been affected by the recent 
improvement in relations between the united states and the soviet 
union kremlin military aid is believed to be in the range of 600 
million to 800 million according to officials and us arms aid 
to unita totals about 50 million 
thirteen senators sent a message to secretary of state james a 
baker iii in moscow earlier this week demanding he object 
strongly to the soviet role in the sevenweekold military 
offensive 
chitunda said he was told the bush administration would make a 
serious effort to promote a ceasefire in angola and to get peace 
talks under way 
he said cuban forces have become more involved than before in 
the offensive by assisting in the delivery of supplies to 
government combatants 
the battle for mavinga is the first major conventional military 
confrontation since south africa agreed in december 1988 to halt 
support for unita and cuba began a withdrawal of its troops backing 
government forces 
unita wants a settlement based on direct negotiations leading to 
national elections the government proposed an amnesty for the 
unita forces that would lead to their reintegration into angolan 
society

seventythree senators say they will oppose 
any cuts in aid for israel and egypt the largest recipients of 
us assistance 
in the middle east we should reaffirm the support of the 
united states for upholding our foreign assistance commitments to 
israel and egypt the senators said in a letter organized by 
sens pete wilson rcalif and carl levin dmich 
the senators letter delivered to the white house on wednesday 
but not publicly released until friday was written in reaction to 
proposals first advanced by senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan to trim aid to israel egypt turkey the philippines and 
pakistan those countries received about 80 percent of the total 
us foreign aid budget 
dole said reducing money for the five countries by 5 percent 
would generate more money for other countries namely those in 
eastern europe 
the underlying proposal to redistribute aid has been supported 
by sens robert byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee and patrick leahy dvt chairman of the 
appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations 
bush administration officials have called for more flexibility 
in dividing up the foreignaid pie 
the bush budget for fiscal 1991 totals about 14 billion 
traditionally israel receives about 3 billion annually from the 
united states with egypt receiving about 23 billion 
the 73 senators said they want to see the united states 
reinforce the democratic trends in the nations of eastern 
europe 
budgetary realities force us to make difficult choices but 
retrenching on our commitment to assistance to israel and egypt 
would not be a wise choice they wrote

the galileo spaceship swooped past venus 
early saturday and the cloudshrouded planet acted as a gravity 
slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its 1995 rendezvous with 
jupiter 
engineers at nasas jet propulsion laboratory received a radio 
signal confirming that the 28ton spacecraft made its closest 
approach to venus at 1259 am est cruising 10028 miles above 
the planets hellishly hot surface 
we have just flown through our closest approach point to 
venus said bill oneil science and mission design manager 
the greatest challenge of getting galileo to jupiter has been 
met 
four hours before the close encounter radio signals received on 
earth confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered galileos infrared 
light sensor to start observing venus the instrument was looking 
for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds 
overhead oneil said 
that started an eighthour period of intensive photography and 
measurements including a photographic search for lightning 
earlier friday galileo studied dust particles and magnetic fields 
in space and measured venusian atmospheric temperatures 
the venus encounter is our first major milestone in the 
mission said galileo project scientist torrence johnson after 
the encounter we have gained enough energy out of this celestial 
billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to 
jupiter 
the power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy 
of its propellant supply said mission director neal ausman 
the 135 billion mission will let galileo examine earth its 
moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into 
an orbiter and a small probe in july 1995 in december 1995 they 
arrive at jupiter the solar systems largest planet after a 
24billionmile trip including 182 million miles to reach venus 
galileo was deployed from the space shuttle atlantis last oct 
18 
venus circles the sun between the orbits of earth and mercury 
the closest planet to the sun acidladen clouds extend 40 miles 
above the surface trapping heat in a runaway greenhouse effect 
that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees fahrenheit 
atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on earth venus is about 95 
percent as wide as earth scientists suspect it may have active 
volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust 
the venus flyby was designed purely to give galileo a boost for 
its trip to jupiter by increasing its speed from 83750 mph to 
88740 mph in two other gravity assist maneuvers the 
spacecraft will use the earth as a slingshot next dec 8 and again 
on dec 8 1992 so it will be properly aimed toward jupiter 
ausman said 
scientists decided to take advantage of the venus encounter by 
having galileos camera and instruments make photographs and 
measurements of venus starting thursday night and continuing for a 
week 
but almost all the pictures and data stored on three tracks of 
galileos fourtrack tape recorder wont be sent back to earth 
until october when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the 
material with its lowgain antenna that antenna now can be used 
only for communications to keep galileo operating 
galileos main umbrellashaped antenna must remain furled to 
protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first 
flight past earth 
galileo was programmed to photograph venus and study the planet 
with its ultraviolet infrared and visible light sensors to look 
for lightning study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere 
examine cloud and wind patterns map cloudtop temperatures and peer 
at the lower atmosphere 
sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were 
programmed to study how solar wind interacts with venus 
atmosphere at the same time nasa arranged for the pioneer venus 
orbiter circling venus since 1978 to make similar measurements 
closer to the planet johnson said 
while nearly 20 other us and soviet spacecraft have visited 
venus we think were going to get some real good stuff he 
said 
but scientists wont know for months unless engineers meet 
success next week when they try to have galileo send back a small 
amount of data johnson added 
studies from earth and previous spacecraft indicate venus has 
continentsized highlands with peaks dwarfing mount everest and 
hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains 
nasas magellan spacecraft launched from atlantis last may 4 
will go into orbit around venus in august it will use radar to 
peer through the clouds and map at least 70 percent of venus 
surface during a 550 million mission 
when the galileo probe and orbiter reach jupiter the probe will 
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense 
heat and pressure vaporize it the orbiter will photograph and 
study jupiter and its major moons until late 1997 circling the 
planet instead of flying past it like the pioneer and voyager 
spacecraft 
the national aeronautics and space administration originally 
planned to send galileo on a twoyear trip to jupiter by launching 
it with a centaur rocket after it was released from a shuttle 
but the 1986 explosion that destroyed challenger and killed 
seven crew members raised safety concerns nasa decided against 
using the volatile liquidfueled centaur 
so galileo was launched with a much weaker inertial upper stage 
booster after it was deployed by atlantis crew the weaker rocket 
required nasa to redesign galileos route so the craft could

lawmakers are complaining they are having a 
hard time explaining to constituents why deeper cuts cant be made 
in us troop strength in europe 
the logic of all this is getting very hard to explain to 
taxpayers sen larry pressler rsd told william h taft iv 
us ambassador to nato on friday 
president bushs proposed 1991 defense budget does not 
recognize anything that has happened in the world in the past six 
months said sen paul simon dill we must be creative and 
responsive and i dont think at this point we are either 
taft told the senate foreign relations committee that american 
forces in europes central zone will not be reduced below 195000 
even if the soviets pull back every soldier they have in the region 
even without a direct and immediate soviet threat he said us 
troops are needed as a visible sign of continued american 
commitment to the north atlantic treaty organization and european 
security 
we have to have visible soldiers walking around pressler 
asked thats going to be hard for me to sell in south dakota 
pressler echoing concerns of committee colleagues said 
prosperous us allies such as france and west germany should 
shoulder a larger share of the defense burden and the united 
states should be able to reap some defense savings because of 
moscows rapidly shrinking sphere of influence 
taft said it was clear that the threat to western europe has 
greatly diminished both because of the changes in eastern europe 
and because of the new treaty limiting intermediaterange nuclear 
forces 
but taft said the 195000troop figure bush proposed in his 
state of the union speech last month is a rockbottom number 
because it looks right to the presidents military advisers 
for the foreseeable future natos strategy of deterrence for 
the prevention of war based upon both nuclear and conventional 
forces remains the best way to prevent war and protect our 
freedom taft said

a united germany could stay with the 
nato alliance and still carve out a special military status for the 
present territory of east germany alliance officials and analysts 
say 
the overriding concern for the north atlantic treaty 
organization is that a reunified germany maintain its ties to the 
west 
nato secretary general manfred woerner a west german says 
there is no acceptable alternative to germany remaining anchored 
in the atlantic alliance 
the new york times today reported that us secretary of state 
james a baker iii suggested a single germany with less than full 
membership in nato might be acceptable 
we favor a continued membership in or association with 
nato the newspaper quoted baker as saying in moscow where he 
was meeting with soviet officials he did not elaborate 
east german premier hans modrow has suggested that a combined 
nation be neutral west germany belongs to the 16nation nato and 
east germany is one of the seven countries in the sovietled warsaw 
pact 
but us and nato officials have dismissed the idea of such a 
large neutral state in europe 
a drifting neutral germany cannot be a solution given the 
countrys geostrategic position and its political economic and 
military potential woerner said in a recent speech in west 
germany 
woerner and president bush will discuss the german question and 
other nato issues this weekend at the presidential retreat at camp 
david md 
hansdietrich genscher west germanys foreign minister has 
sketched out another plan for a successor nation it would remain 
part of nato but only the territory of west germany would be tied 
to its military structure nato would not extend its forces farther 
east 
baker has registered his support for genschers plan 
a formula would have to be found for dealing with the large 
contingents of forces stationed in both germanys 
about 380000 soviet troops are stationed in east germany more 
than 200000 american soldiers are based across the border in west 
germany belgium britain france and the netherlands have an 
additional 100000 or so troops there 
negotiators for nato and the warsaw pact are bargaining in 
vienna to cut forces tanks artillery and other nonnuclear arms 
in europe bush recently suggested that washington and moscow set 
equal ceilings of 225000 troops in all of europe with 195000 
troops in central europe which would include both germanys 
on friday soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev proposed a limit 
of 195000 troops for both sides in all of europe 
some have raised the possibility that to ease the kremlins 
fears about a united germany soviet troops could remain in place 
in a guantanamo fashion that refers to the presence of us 
naval forces in guantanamo bay in communist cuba 
there are precedents for what some call a la carte 
membership in nato 
spain and france are members of nato but keep their forces 
outside the joint military structure spain also does not allow the 
storing of nuclear weapons on its soil 
norway which shares a border with the soviet union is a member 
of the integrated military structure but has set out certain 
peacetime limitations 
no foreign troops are stationed on its soil no alliance forces 
take part in military exercises in the extreme northern part of the 
country nuclear weapons also cannot be warehoused on its territory 
indeed west germany itself offers a special case 
the bonn government joined the western alliance in 1955 
becoming its 15th member 
as part of membership it had to put its military forces except 
for a defensive territorial army under the alliance command it is 
the only country to have assigned to the joint structure in 
peacetime

the bush administration has asked congress to 
remove import duties on clothing shoes and other laborintensive 
products from the caribbean and central america but says it opposes 
any tampering with sugar quotas imposed on the region 
endorsing an extension and expansion of president reagans 1983 
caribbean basin initiative us trade representative carla hills 
said friday that lifting the present duties would mitigate the 
need for foreign aid and raise our own exports to the region 
however she said changing import quota formulas on sugar to 
assure the caribbean a stable us market to the possible detriment 
of other exporters such as australia and the philippines would 
violate international trade agreements 
when asked at a senate hearing if she would recommend that 
president bush veto a bill that includes a guaranteed minimum for 
sugar imports from the caribbean mrs hills said she didnt know 
congress is expected this year to make permanent the current 
program now scheduled to expire in september 1995 but expanding 
it to include dutyfree status on a wide variety of goods that 
compete with us products is encountering widespread opposition

lincoln savings and loan association was 
manufacturing profits by giving its money away says an 
accountant who examined lincolns books at the governments request 
roger johnson testified friday in us district court that the 
collapsed thrift owned by phoenix financier charles h keating and 
seized by federal regulators last april recorded 135 million in 
pretax gains on 15 land transactions in 1986 and 1987 
but in reality there was a net outflow of cash from lincoln 
in each instance said johnson a certified public accountant for 
kenneth leventhal amp co 
the net cash expended by lincoln to accomplish the sales totaled 
217 million according to a draft of a report prepared last july 
by johnsons firm and introduced in court 
reading from the report johnson said the irvine calif thrift 
was made to function as an engine designed to funnel insured 
deposits to keatings phoenix holding company the american 
continental corp 
the cash outflow is precisely the opposite of what you would 
expect the profits reported should have been reversed 
johnson told us district court judge stanley sporkin 
lincoln is suing the governments office of thrift supervision 
seeking a court order to remove the conservatorship and 
receivership regulators imposed last year to seize control of the 
thrift 
american continental corp benefited from the 15 transactions 
under a taxsharing agreement in which lincoln made payments to its 
parent

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki has 
asked 17 creditor nations if his noncommunist government could 
halt payments on polands 40 billion foreign debt officials said 
mazowiecki requested a suspension of payments because we are 
at the moment introducing a very difficult economic reform 
program government spokesman zbigniew augustynowicz said in an 
interview 
mazowiecki made the request friday in a letter sent to fellow 
government leaders in the paris club which meets next week 
the club an informal grouping of representatives of western 
creditor nations that gathers occasionally in paris was expected 
to take up polands debt problems wednesday 
about 65 percent or 26 billion of polands hardcurrency debt 
is owed to 17 governments in the club 
poland which has had a noncommunist government since last 
summer has been paying about 15 billion annually to service its 
western debt the largest such obligation in eastern europe 
those payments while falling far short of polands obligations 
consume nearly all of the countrys net export earnings leaving 
poland little money to invest in rebuilding its dilapidated economy 
however major debt rescheduling with the paris club was refused 
until polands new solidarityled government and the international 
monetary fund could reach agreement on a tough adjustment program 
to reform polands economy the plan took effect jan 1 and was 
formally approved by the imf executive board last week 
according to augustynowicz the letter asks specifically that 
the creditor governments 
permit poland to suspend all paris club debt payments 
including interest and principal for 1989 and 1990 
consider freezing the countrys western debt at its current 
level of 40 billion this would require the paris club governments 
to exert pressure on their countries commercial banks which hold 
most of the rest of the 40 billion debt 
seek a longterm solution to the polish debt problem that 
would go in the direction of outright debt reduction 
the paris club had been expected to offer poland a 
magnanimous restructuring of the debt allowing it to stretch 
out 5 billion in payments due the next two years over 10 years a 
us finance official david c mulford said last month 
most of the debt was accumulated during the 1970s by the 
communist government under thenparty leader edward gierek 
in the 1970s communist authorities borrowed and spent western 
money freely on illconceived investment projects and on food and 
consumer goods in an attempt to win public affection later 
communist governments acknowledged that the money was wasted 
when polands economy slumped at the end of the 1970s and the 
beginning of the 1980s the country was no longer able to keep up 
payments and mounting interest doubled the debt to the 40 billion 
level by this year

a pentagon decision to shelve contingency 
plans for fighting a war with the soviet union in iran eliminates a 
strategic doctrine that has guided us policy in the persian gulf 
for four decades 
during that time us military planners have prepared for a 
soviet attack southward through iran toward the gulfs vital oil 
fields the americans would block it in the rugged zagros mountain 
range which parallels much of irans gulf coastline 
according to published accounts in washington the pentagons 
defense planning guidance report for 199297 just approved by 
defense secretary dick cheney declares that neither a soviet 
invasion of iran nor the us ability to counter it is now 
considered credible 
according to reports the pentagon document directs military 
planners to formulate a new strategy that assumes soviet military 
strength will be reduced through negotiations on conventional force 
levels in europe and that future threats to the gulf would 
originate elsewhere 
although not named potential adversaries evidently include 
iran which is hostile to saudi arabia and still technically at war 
with iraq despite their 1988 ceasefire iraq stronger as a 
result of its military triumph in the eightyear gulf war is also 
mistrusted by some arab states 
the zagros strategy by some accounts dates back to 1946 when 
thensoviet leader josef stalin hoping to gain access to the 
gulfs warmwater ports tested his former world war ii allies by 
attempting to annex territory in northern iran 
the effort was thwarted by us and british diplomacy at the 
united nations american policy has recognized moscows interest in 
obtaining access to the gulf and perhaps dominating the 
oilproducing arab states along its shores 
from those days until now according to foreign policy expert 
gary sick us leaders have seen iran as the most likely place 
outside europe where a ussoviet clash might escalate into 
another world war 
the united states had the advantage until its close ally shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi was overthrown in 1979 his islamic 
fundamentalist successor ayatollah ruhollah khomeini rejected 
ties with both washington and moscow making iran a hostile setting 
for both superpowers in the event of a showdown 
the us doctrine of blocking soviet moves through iran acquired 
new importance after moscow invaded neighboring afghanistan in 1979 
and deployed warships near the gulf 
although undoubtedly influenced by the easing of eastwest 
tensions the shift toward a new pentagon strategy for the gulf 
reflects thinking that predates the soviet bloc upheavals by at 
least a year us sources say 
as early as 1988 these sources have said military analysts 
were giving less weight to the prospect of a us counteroffensive 
in iran in favor of direct defense of the gulf itself 
this change the sources said was based partly on a belief that 
neither the soviets nor the united states could long sustain major 
military operations in a country where both terrain and politics 
are hostile the zagros mountains have peaks of up to 18000 feet 
in december 1988 the retiring commander of us central 
command marine gen george b crist was quoted as saying he had 
proposed to the us joint chiefs of staff a new plan for deploying 
us land sea and air forces to defend key objectives from the 
northern gulf to the strait of hormuz 600 miles to the southeast 
crist said new intelligence indicated the soviets would try to 
seize such objectives rather than mount a major land thrust through 
iran 
any new strategy would require at least prolonging the 
40yearold american naval presence in the gulf soon to be cut 
from 10 to seven ships in addition a nineship carrier group is 
in the arabian sea 
but how large additional forces could be maintained without land 
bases nearby is unclear while privately welcoming the us 
military presence the politically sensitive gulf states refused 
during the iraniraq war to allow us bases on their territory

the vanishing image of the harddrinking 
chainsmoking reporter has lost more of its varnish americas 
oldest press club has closed its doors 
the 98yearold pen amp pencil club survived the death of more 
than a dozen philadelphia periodicals but now has fallen victim to 
the changing drinking habits of journalists and the highcrime 
neighborhood it moved to in 1986 
more than a hundred people close to half the clubs dwindling 
membership jammed the bar friday night threatening the beer 
supply 
stories were swapped about the card games in the 1950s that 
would bring police raids the time a couple got caught in the 
restroom in an amorous clinch the numerous raunchy parties 
the club chartered in 1892 and billed as americas oldest press 
club by local newspapers and the national press club has seen a 
host of famous names cross its doorway 
red smith and damon runyon were members guests included mae 
west william jennings bryan and former mayor frank rizzo 
us presidents hoover coolidge and taft imbibed at the clubs 
bar according to club history taft skipped out on his tab 
there were some wild times at the club said larry fish a 
reporter for the philadelphia inquirer there was a real front 
page atmosphere there 
the journalist as harddrinker was firmly entrenched in 
americana after the premiere of the front page a play of the 
1920s that portrayed reporters as hoodlumesque halfdrunken 
caballeros 
inquirer reporter tom belden said the changing drinking habits 
of reporters caused the clubs demise 
when he first began coming to the club in 1979 there were a 
dozen or so single men who would drop 20 to 50 a night they kept 
the bar going themselves 
but journalism is no longer dominated by single men he said 
and married people tend to stay home with their family more often 
and drink more orange juice than liquor he added 
the national press club based in washington dc estimated 
that 22 press clubs closed between 1982 and 1985 
the philadelphia club had been located above a diner about 
halfway between buildings housing the inquirer and the evening 
bulletin when the bulletin folded in 1982 the club decided to 
move closer to the inquirer building 
that move was seen by many as the beginning of the end 
we thought people getting off work in the afternoon would 
wander over for a drink said fish who was on the clubs board 
at the time but every time i came over thered be nobody here 
members said the new location on the edge of a poorer 
highcrime neighborhood caused many people to stay away several 
people friday had stories of their cars being vandalized 
also gone were the scores of associate members those not in 
the profession who would stop by the downtown location 
before voting to close the pen amp pencil club officials even 
considered holding aerobics classes and childcare groups moves 
the older reporters dismissed 
the pen amp pencil was losing 300 to 400 a week when the clubs 
officers voted last month to close down 
jack sherzer a harrisburg patriotnews reporter traveled two 
hours for friday nights farewell 
journalists are a loner crowd and without a place like this 
well he said shrugging where are we going to go to meet

rightwing paramilitary groups funded by drug 
traffickers pose the biggest threat to human rights in colombia and 
investigations of their crimes are often hindered by police 
according to a un report 
the report published friday urged colombian authorities to 
dismiss anyone in the armed forces or police found to have 
cooperated with the death squads 
the report by amos wako to be presented to the un human 
rights comission said that for many years murder had been the main 
cause of death among adults in colombia 
it called for an international fund be established to help 
protect judges and witnesses and more international to increase the 
number of police investigators and improve their training 
in the first nine months of last year 2337 people lost their 
lives as a result of political and military conflict the report 
said 
it said 603 victims were whitecollar workers most of them 
government employees killed in retaliation for the governments 
clampdown on drug traffickers 
the report said another 456 victims were peasants who were labor 
activists or suspected of sympathizing with the various 
antigovernment guerrilla groups 
most died at the hands of the estimated 140 paramilitary groups 
trained and financed by drug barons and operating closely with 
elements in the armed forces and police it said 
it said in some cases police ignored the crimes hindered 
investigations or offered safe conduct passes to paramilitary 
members 
wako cited concerns by some private human rights groups in 
colombia that existing foreign aid was mainly military in character 
and focused more on countering antigovernment guerrillas rather 
than drug traffickers or paramilitary squads 
the report also criticized violence and blackmail tactics used 
by leftwing guerrillas it welcomed efforts by president virgilio 
barcos government to promote dialogue with the insurgency 
movements 
wako a kenyan wrote the report following a 10day un mission 
to colombia in october

the acquittal of reputed mob boss john gotti on 
charges he ordered the shooting of a union official brought cheers 
in court and a celebration in the queens neighborhood where the 
dapper don is king 
gotti the man authorities call americas no 1 organized crime 
boss won his third victory over government prosecutors friday when 
a jury found him innocent of assault and conspiracy 
his codefendant anthony guerrieri was also acquitted 
gottis supporters applauded loudly as the verdict was read 
provoking acting justice edward mclaughlin to threaten them with 30 
days in jail if they didnt stop 
gotti who favors 1800 suits and pinkie rings kissed his 
lawyer bruce cutler after the verdict and left the manhattan 
courthouse without commenting 
a short time later he arrived at a favorite hangout in 
manhattans little italy and was cheered wildly by people waiting 
for him on the street two women kissed him before he ducked 
inside later fireworks were set off 
near another gotti hangout the bergin hunt and fish club in the 
borough of queens residents decorated homes and stores with 
balloons and signs congratulating gotti on his acquittal 
were happy he won hes a good man to have on the avenue 
said resident phyllis maccarelli 
gotti 49 allegedly assumed control of the gambino family after 
the december 1985 execution of big paul castellano and his 
bodyguard outside a manhattan restaurant 
since then gotti has been tried three times and won each case 
he was cleared in 1986 of beating a man in a traffic dispute after 
the victim claimed he could not identify gotti he was acquitted 
the next year in a federal racketeering case 
when he was arrested on the latest charge gotti said his odds 
of winning were 3 to 1 
gotti and guerrieri were accused of commissioning the westies a 
hells kitchen gang to shoot john f oconnor on may 7 1986 he 
was shot in the buttocks and survived 
the prosecutor assistant district attorney michael cherkasky 
said gotti arranged the shooting because oconnor ordered thugs to 
vandalize a mobrun restaurant being built with nonunion labor 
the governments case was damaged when oconnor in testimony 
denied knowing who had ordered him shot 
we think it was a fair trial but were disappointed 
cherkasky said after the verdict 
cutler gottis lawyer said this verdict shows you cant put 
people in jail by calling them names calling them gangsters and 
things like that 
the defense lawyers ridiculed the prosecutions main evidence 
the testimony of former westie member james mcelroy and scarcely 
audible tapes secretly recorded in 1986 in the rikers island jail 
visiting room and at the bergin hunt and fish club 
cutler and shargel said a key tape on which gotti allegedly 
says were gonna gonna bust him up is inaudible and that 
prosecutors transcribed it to suit their theory that gotti had 
oconnor shot 
i did not hear anything in these tapes that would lead me to 
believe mr gotti had a hand in this assault juror richard 
silensky said 
another juror who wouldnt give his name said there was 
nothing to connect mr gotti to what happened zilch 
the jurors were sequestered for security reasons throughout the 
threeweek trial 
mcelroy who testified that he was part of the group that shot 
oconnor as a favor to gotti was portrayed by the defense as a 
liar who hoped to shorten the 60year prison term he is serving and 
get better terms for his girlfriend in a drug case 
oconnor testified as a surprise witness for the defense he 
admitted his union was plagued by internal troubles and 
acknowledged it was possible that a union rival could have arranged 
the shooting 
the judge told the jurors they could convict the defendants only 
if the prosecution proved they arranged the shooting and not simply 
because they might be members of organized crime 
had he been convicted gotti could have faced 25 years to life 
in prison as a persistent felon because of convictions in 1969 and 
1974 in the latter case gotti pleabargained down to an attempted 
manslaughter charge in the slaying of a man in a staten island bar

sixteen days before the presidential 
election the leftist government honored a pledge and freed nearly 
1000 contra guerrillas and the last 39 jailed members of former 
president anastasio somozas national guard 
president daniel ortega who is running for reelection 
proposed the pardon earlier this month the pardon and the 
release friday deprived his major opponent violeta barrios de 
chamorro of a campaign issue for the feb 25 election 
the release was witnessed by diplomats four contra commanders 
who have laid down their arms international election observers and 
church and red cross representatives 
the sandinista government made the most of the ceremony taking 
several busloads of reporters to the juan navarro central 
penitentiary where the inmates stood in lines in front of the 
assembled dignitaries 
among the guardsmen were men accused of the most serious crimes 
committed during the rule of somoza who was toppled by the 
sandinistas in 1979 
as a soldier i obeyed the orders of my superiors i didnt do 
anything without orders said former maj hugo torres who 
admitted to being part of a secret squad accused of killing 
opponents of somoza 
somoza was assassinated sept 17 1980 in asuncion paraguay 
where he lived in exile 
many guardsmen imprisoned after summary trials in peoples

larry rigby gambled five years ago on a 
biomedical device that mimics the human lung if it pays off 
beating long odds his tiny company could become a lifegiving 
giant 
rigby a venture capitalist teamed up with dr jd mortensen 
to found cardiopulmonics inc maker of the experimental lung 
device that was implanted in a teenager who died earlier in the 
week 
the operation was the first time a person had received the 
intravascular oxygenator dubbed ivox which has been approved by 
federal regulators in patients who have little chance of survival 
the device which works like a lung is a 20inch bundle of 
hollow polypropylene fibers designed to handle as much as half the 
bodys oxygen delivery and elimination of carbon dioxide it was 
designed for patients suffering acute but reversible lung disease 
or injury 
i think its very promising technology rigby said we 
could be a 100 million company in five years if the technology is 
what we think it is 
rigby said he was pleased that the instrument functioned as 
expected during its first human trial but sounded a cautionary 
note 
this is research he said you just cant make leaping 
conclusions from one example 
under guidelines approved by the us food and drug 
administration the ivox will be tested in up to 10 people who 
require 100 percent oxygen to detect possible tissue damage 
suffering from respiratory distress syndrome melicia mimi 
harvey 16 of arthur city texas died wednesday of pulmonary 
failure at lds hospital four days after the implant tim madden a 
spokesman at the hospital said there were no clinical 
complications from the device 
if the device proves successful up to 200000 patients annually 
in the united states and more in japan and europe could be 
recipients rigby said but the company which employs 32 people 
must overcome marrying high techology with sound business practices 
marketing is the tough chore a lot of the smaller companies 
look for small speciality niches where a large company wouldnt be 
interested in competing said bob brewer of utah technology 
finance corp an independent state agency that gave a small amount 
of seed money to cardiopulmonics 
some succeed others have difficulties he said 
the company was founded in 1985 with money from the two 
cofounders and mortensens 550000 grant from the federal small 
business innovation program 
by last year rigby had secured 77 million from five investment 
companies that now own controlling stock in the privately held 
company 
as a business opportunity something like this is very 
longrange and investors need very deep pockets but the return in 
the end could be very substantial he said 
if the ivox reaches the market its external gas pressure 
regulator will sell for about 10000 and the disposable 
oxygenator for about 2500 each 
ivox offshoots such as the coating that prevents blood clots on 
the fibrous bundle also could be marketed to manufacturers of 
surgical instruments rigby said 
he said cardiopulmonics has had inquiries from scores of 
domestic and foreign medical institutions and a few japanese 
companies whose identities he wont reveal

a former mortician serving a sentence for 
mutilating corpses was charged with murder in the poisoning death 
of a competitor in 1985 authorities said 
the case against david wayne sconce 33 of pasadena is believed 
to be the nations first prosecution of a death by oleander 
poisoning said deputy district attorney harvey giss 
sconce former operator of the lamb funeral home will be tried 
in ventura county for the death of timothy raymond waters 24 who 
ran the alpha society cremation service in burbank giss said 
sconce was charged friday with firstdegree murder with the 
special circumstances of murder by poison a conviction under the 
special circumstances allegation could bring the death penalty 
arraignment was scheduled feb 26 in ventura municipal court 
sconce was sentenced to five years in state prison last 
september after he pleaded guilty to mutilating corpses conducting 
mass cremations and stealing dental gold from bodies 
he also pleaded guilty to hiring thugs to beat up three 
competing morticians including waters failure to bury the body of 
a baby girl and car theft 
it was during a preliminary hearing concerning the macabre 
charges involving the funeral homes operations that witnesses 
testified sconce had bragged about poisoning waters 
the comments prompted authorities to reopen an investigation 
into waters death waters died april 8 1985 at his parents home 
in camarillo 
the ventura county coroners office initially determined the 
death stemmed from natural causes but ruled it was murder after a 
second autopsy revealed traces of oleander poison in blood and 
tissue samples 
testimony in a preliminary hearing revealed sconce possessed a 
book entitled the poor mans james bond which featured a 
chapter on how to kill by oleander poisoning oleander is a 
poisonous evergreen shrub 
deaths from oleander poisoning are rare some cases are 
accidental as in a california case several years ago when a woman 
died after brewing an oleander tea from what she thought were 
harmless leaves

west german opposition politicians said a 
libyan chemical plant allegedly built with west german help has 
begun to produce poison gas 
reinhard kraemer a spokesman for the environmentalist greens 
party in bonn said friday the greens have received information 
from the government that the plant has produced enough poison gas 
for 1000 artillery shells 
the libyan government denied the plant was making poison gas 
and the west german government refused to comment but us 
officials said the plant had started producing chemicals possibly 
for chemical weapons 
the plant 60 miles south of tripoli in the town of rabta 
caused a huge scandal last year with us allegations that west 
german firms helped build the plant 
west germany at first denied the allegations but it ultimately 
launched its own investigation and accused the imhausenchemie firm 
of helping build the libyan plant the investigation has not yet 
been concluded 
a government spokesman in bonn when asked about the new report 
that production had begun at the plant said we cannot take a 
position at this time 
a us official in washington said friday that the libyans have 
been producing very small amounts of chemicals possibly for 
weapons use for about a year 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the plant 
60 miles south of tripoli is producing nowhere near its design 
capacity and that the united states is monitoring the situation 
the libyan government of col moammar gadhafi has denied the 
rabta plant was designed to produce poison gas saying it is for 
the production of pharmaceuticals 
ali sunni muntasser libyas deputy representative to the united 
nations said friday night all these stories about manufacturing 
gases or chemicals or anything is untrue 
however albrecht mueller a federal lawmaker with the main 
opposition social democratic party said he was told by a west 
german government official the rabta plant is making poison gas 
he said the information was released during a meeting wednesday 
of the parliamentary economics committee 
i gathered from the meeting the production started last 
year mueller said in a telephone interview 
he said an economics ministry official identified the chemical 
name as lost which is a military term for 
dichlordiaethylsulphide a poison gas used to disable enemy 
soldiers 
mueller said he did not recall the name of the official who 
released the information 
the lawmaker said he had heard from other sources that the rabta 
plant has produced more than 20 tons of the poison gas since last 
year he would not identify the other sources 
other sources in bonn speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the matter came up at closeddoor meetings of the parliamentary 
foreign committee as well as the economics committee

john doe a man who remembers only bits and 
pieces of his life prior to last october says he doesnt know what 
to think about people claiming him as their lost relative 
i dont know how to explain it its good but i dont 
remember any of these people he said friday in a telephone 
interview 
doe said he last remembers being picked up by topeka police as 
he was wandering through a motel parking lot in october 
he had no identification and told police he did not know his 
name address or anything else about his past 
since then hes undergone extensive hypnotherapy and had his 
fingerprints sent to the fbi 
but the search for his identity produced only tiny clues until 
thursday night when milwaukee television station wititv aired a 
report on doe by wibwtv in topeka 
people in wisconsin who saw the program claimed to be does 
relatives according to does therapist rick selig 
selig said the presumed relatives say doe is actually melvin 
wolf a 53yearold small appliance repairman from angleton texas 
they said wolf left home aug 20 on a business trip and never 
returned 
donna caske wolfs sister from angleton is expected to arrive 
today in topeka to determine whether doe is actually wolf selig 
said 
legally we cant say that this individual is melvin wolf 
until we get confirmation with the fingerprints said selig a 
clinical social worker at the topeka psychiatric clinic selig has 
worked with doe since he was found in october 
but selig and authorities said its possible that doe is wolf 
selig said that about a month ago during hypnosis doe began to 
recall certain details of his life such as a us army serial 
number a farm scene and the first names of his parents he also 
spoke fluent german and stated that he served in germany during 
world war ii selig said he recalled vivid details of berlin and 
remembered that he once owned a 1966 dodge van 
the serial number belonged to melvin wolf selig said and all 
other information he gave under hypnosis had been corroborated 
friday with mrs caske and people in wisconsin also claiming to be 
relatives 
topeka police sgt greg halford said authorities plan to check 
does fingerprints with wolfs and meet with mrs caske and other 
relatives 
we do not think this is a hoax halford said 
selig said doe spoke friday on the telephone with mrs caske and 
others claiming to be relatives but he did not remember them mrs 
caske said wolf lived with her 
hopefully seeing them will spark some memories for him 
said selig who diagnosed doe as suffering from psychogenic amnesia 
a total memory loss that can come from some extraordinarily 
stressful event a very painful event 
after a lengthy hospital stay doe has been living at a halfway 
house in topeka 
i dont know what to say doe said about todays meeting 
im nervous excited scared everything you can say i hope

former president reagan will give a videotaped 
deposition for john poindexters trial in his first indepth 
questioning on the irancontra affair since his two interviews with 
the tower commission 
in those interviews conducted three years ago by the 
reaganappointed commission reagan said he couldnt remember when 
he had approved arm sales to iran 
reagan on friday consented to a videotaped deposition in which 
poindexters lawyers will ask him 154 questions plus followup 
questions 
the subject areas will include reagans knowledge of oliver 
norths activities on behalf of the contras and whether reagan 
authorized written responses to congress relating to the nicaraguan 
rebels poindexter now faces felony charges in connection with 
those responses to congress 
details on timing and other arrangements for the videotaped 
testimony will be worked out monday in a hearing before us 
district court judge harold greene who will preside at the 
poindexter trial scheduled to start feb 20 
reagan proposed to answer the questions feb 16 in los angeles 
reagan said in a court filing that he recognizes the courts have 
a responsibility to protect poindexters rights but his lawyers 
also said reagan retains the right to invoke executive privilege to 
specific questions during the deposition 
indicating they expect bush administration representatives to be 
permitted to attend the deposition reagans lawyers said they will 
defer to the incumbent president regarding issues of executive 
privilege on national security or foreign affairs 
the former national security adviser is charged with conspiracy 
two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of making false 
statements 
greene will attend the deposition to rule on disputes claiming 
executive privilege to specific questions could result in halting 
the deposition in midstream and taking the matter through court 
appeals or more likely the deposition would continue while the 
specific questions at issue remain unanswered pending appeals 
the videotape deposition format will provide an appropriate 
mechanism to protect sensitive classified national security 
information and confidential deliberations reagans lawyers said 
the edited videotape would be shown at poindexters trial 
reagan told the commission led by former sen john tower 
rtexas that he did not know the national security council staff 
was engaged in helping the contras the board said it was aware of 
no evidence to suggest reagan was aware of norths activities on 
behalf of the contras when north was an nsc aide 
poindexter however will ask reagan whether he knew far more 
than he told the tower commission about norths activities 
poindexter also plans to ask reagan if he approved responses to 
congress inquiring into whether north was assisting the contras 
in the responses poindexter endorsed letters sent to congress a 
year earlier by thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane 
denying north was raising money or providing military advice to the 
contras mcfarlane in 1988 pleaded guilty to withholding 
information from congress in connection with the letters 
reagan also would be asked about discussions with poindexter 
regarding a chronology on the iran arms sales that is involved in 
four of the five criminal charges against poindexter 
the chronology prepared by others at poindexters direction 
falsely states that no one in the us government knew until 
january 1986 that a ciaassisted november 1985 shipment from israel 
to iran contained hawk missiles 
when reagan first met with the tower commission he said he had 
approved the shipment of arms from israel to iran in august 1985 
but he changed his statements in his second meeting saying he 
hadnt approved the first shipment but authorized later ones 
a week later he wrote the tower board to saying simply i 
cannot recall whether he approved an israeli sale in advance

in a fight that may set the pace of 
political reform governing party factions are battling over the 
selection of a running mate for president lee tenghui who is 
expected to be nominated for reelection sunday 
the outcome of the struggle between conservatives and reformers 
may also help determine how long chiang kaishek loyalists many 
in their 80s remain in their powerful positions 
one conservative favorite for running mate is chiang wego a 
former general and son of chiang kaishek 
his father lost the civil war to the communists on the mainland 
and fled to taiwan in 1949 where he led an authoritarian regime 
for four decades 
the struggle for a presidential partner has been hard fought 
liu kuotsai speaker of the legislature quoted the president 
today as saying he was exhausted mentally and physically over 
the choice 
december elections gave urgency to the task of overhauling the 
nationalist party the governing party lost several key local seats 
to the opposition and overall gained 58 percent of the vote down 
from 70 percent in 1986 
the elections were the first multiparty vote since the lifting 
of 38 years of martial law 
chang chungtung a history professor of national taiwan 
university said people want president lee to establish a 
democratic insitution rather than becoming another dictator 
in the nationalist party convention sunday 180 members of the 
partys central committee are widely expected to nominate lee for 
another six years as president the central committee includes many 
military and government officials who pledged allegiance to lee 
after he succeeded another of chiang kaisheks sons president 
chiang chingkuo he died in office in 1988 
lee will then announce his running mate and the committee will 
vote on his choice 
elderly members of the national assembly taiwans electoral 
college which will meet in march to elect the president and vice 
president have lobbied for a conservative running mate as a 
counterweight to lee he is considered a political reformer 
many of the old guard who gained their positions as chiang 
kaishek loyalists fear that if lee picks a reformer like himself 
they will quickly be forced out of power loss of power will mean a 
loss of salary and lucrative perks 
lee the first native taiwanese to head the nationalist 
government and party gave no hint of his choice of a running mate 
on the eve of the convention his silence was an indication of his 
difficulties in finding a compromise 
lee reportedly would like to pick his running mate from 
reformminded cabinet ministers and officials such as james soong 
secretarygeneral of the nationalist party 
but observers say lee must also appease the assemblymen to 
prevent them from vetoing future reform bills 
they occupy 658 of the 764 seats in the national assembly the 
remainder being held by taiwanelected members and 
nationalistappointed members from overseas chinese all of the 
elderly members were elected before 1949 to permanent office to 
support the nationalist claim to be the sole legitimate rulers of 
all china 
more than 200 elderly assemblymen mostly retired military 
officials have pledged support to chiang wego a 74yearold 
former army general who is secretary general of the national 
security council 
chiang has said he doesnt want the job but he had not ruled it 
out if he is asked 
many elderly assemblymen also support 73yearold premier lee

us secretary of state james a baker iii 
challenged the soviet union today to end military and financial 
support to marxist cuba and came under a blizzard of criticism from 
soviet officials about us arms spending and the invasion of 
panama 
baker in an unprecedented appearance before the soviet 
legislature lectured his hosts about the darkness at noon era 
of the past and said the american people and congress cannot 
understand how the soviet government can send billions of rubles of 
assistance to countries like cuba and nicaragua 
not only were those countries supporting subversion in the 
western hemisphere baker said but the soviet aid is even less 
comprehensible when it happens at a time when your people clearly 
need those scarce resources put to good use at home 
baker spoke before the international affairs committee of the 
supreme soviet in an 18th century ceremonial hall with a marble 
bust of lenin behind him his appearance marked the first time a 
us government official appeared in the legislative chamber an 
event baker attributed to reforms undertaken by president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
for over 40 years we have waged a cold war against one 
other baker said now is the time to put the legacy of 
struggle behind us now is the time to build a new legacy now 
is the time to move beyond the cold war 
but while complimenting the steps taken under gorbachev 
including the historic decision this week to end the communist 
partys monopoly on political power baker salted his speech with a 
thrust at soviet support for marxist countries 
three times in the course of replying to questions baker called 
soviet support for cuba intolerable he complained about the 
shipment of new mig jet fighter planes and questioned why moscow 
was aiding president fidel castro when he is so critical of 
gorbachevs policies 
we remain especially disturbed by the military shipments your 
government continues to send to those seeking military solutions to 
conflicts in regions vital to us he said 
several committee members challenged baker on the invasion of 
panama and on several arms control fronts including us refusal 
to join the soviets in a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing or 
to consider naval disarmament 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev a military adviser to gorbachev 
said the united states at the end of world war ii had encircled the 
soviet union with military bases and had not retreated from that 
policy 
akhromeyev a leading figure in ussoviet arms control 
accords questioned why the us administration only trimmed 
defense spending while the soviets were cutting their defense 
budget by 14 percent as eastwest tensions ease

eight bombs exploded today in the 
stronghold of moslem militants seeking independence for the 
himalayan valley of kashmir authorities said no one was injured 
authorities said the blasts at two banks a post office and 
other shops and businesses occurred hours after fire swept through 
a shopping complex in srinagar the summer capital of jammukashmir 
state 
no one claimed responsibilty for the explosions 
police said they believe the blaze was an accident since it 
occurred before dawn while a curfew was still in force 
but other officials speaking on condition of anonymity blamed 
the fire and the bombs on the jammukashmir liberation front the 
militant group leading the fourdecadeold drive for the countrys 
only moslem majority state to secede from predominantly hindu india 
india routinely blames neighoring pakistan of arming training 
and supporting the militants pakistan denies the charge but says 
the kashmiri people have a right to selfdetermination 
at least 82 people have been killed since jan 20 in frequent 
street clashes between militants and security forces in srinagar 
and adjoining areas most of the victims have been protesters shot 
while defying curfew imposed by government forces to stem rising 
violence 
the curfew was relaxed during the day from 5 am to 6 pm 
except in the areas where the explosions occurred 
kashmir once a princely state was divided between india and 
pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end 
of british colonial rule in 1947 srinagar and the surrounding 
areas of the valley became part of jammukashmir 
sixtyfour percent of the states 5 million people are moslems 
but moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 million population 
nationwide 
kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with 
pakistan which claims kashmir because of its predominant moslem 
population but the militants now demand independence and the 
status of a neutral country 
india has fought two wars with pakistan over kashmir

federal marine agents concerned about reports 
that boaters are harassing migrating gray whales have orders to 
write fines of up to 25000 to anyone seen getting too close to 
the whales 
agent ray sautter of the national marine fisheries service said 
friday he called for the patrols today and sunday after going on a 
whalewatching cruise off san diegos point loma last weekend 
the coast guard will assist the fisheries agents he said 
i dont think anybody starts out their day by saying lets 
go harass some whales today i think they just want to get 
closer sautter said but when you start seeing boats that are 
making course changes to pursue the whales and whales making course 
changes to evade the boats that is a violation 
sautter said he saw several pleasure boaters venturing too close 
to the whales last week vessels should keep at least 100 yards 
from the whales and aircraft must fly at a minimum altitude of 
1000 feet while within a 100yard radius of the whales he said 
i dont want to scare people or blindside them he said 
were just trying to get people to enjoy the whales but to give 
them a little bit of room 
if you were out in south dakota and saw a buffalo in the 
middle of a field you wouldnt drive your car out in the middle of 
it to see the animal he said but thats what some people are 
doing out in the water with the whales 
the gray whales which are protected under the marine mammal 
protection act hug the southern california coast on their journey 
from alaska to their breeding grounds off baja california

politicians shrugged off remarks by a reputed mob 
leader in a secretly taped conversation that he had paid off local 
officials and influenced last years mayoral race 
two of the officials implicated in the tape played friday at a 
bond hearing cook county sheriff james ogrady and his former top 
aide county gop chairman james dvorak called for the appointment 
of a special prosecutor 
a full and impartial public hearing is the only way to answer 
these allegations ogrady said in a statement 
these allegations are absolutely preposterous said dvorak 
this is merely one mobster boasting to another 
the statements recorded in september were made by reputed mob 
gambling boss rocco infelice 67 of suburban river forest who was 
among 20 alleged mobsters whose indictments were announced 
wednesday by us attorney general dick thornburgh 
on the tape played at fridays hearing infelice said 10000 a 
month went to the sheriff an apparent reference to ogrady 
who said the remarks were untrue 
an internal revenue service agent who testified friday said mob 
officials identified dvorak as the conduit through which money was 
paid to the sheriffs office dvorak vehemently denied this 
if i was concerned about it id be in argentina right now 
not standing before you dvorak told reporters 
on the tape infelice also said he had given mayor richard m 
daley a lot of help in this last election mostly by not 
backing one of daleys rivals former alderman edward vrdolyak the 
republican candidate 
daley called the claim bs 
what are they talking about he said we ran a good 
campaign all of a sudden people like them are going to start 
taking credit for my election 
acting us attorney ira raphaelson said that daley was not a 
target of the federal investigation he had no comment when he was 
asked about the other officials 
the tape played at the bond hearing was recorded by william 
jahoda a bookmaker who agreed to cooperate with federal agents and 
wore a concealed recorder according to testimony 
jahoda was among those indicted wednesday the terms of his 
agreement with prosecutors have not been disclosed 
the government was attempting at the hearing before us 
magistrate thomas rosemond to block bonds for infelice and four 
other defendants the hearing was to continue monday 
the federal indictment charges infelice with a variety of 
offenses including murder racketeering conspiracy illegal 
gambling and tax cheating 
infelices lawyer patrick tuite said he thought the 
allegations on the tape were just a lot of hot air

three children who attended a 
daycare center owned by a man charged with having child 
pornography contracted a sexually transmitted disease police said 
authorities said no evidence links the infections to the 
preschool or its owner 
examinations found gonorrhea infections in the throats of three 
of the dozens of children examined at broward countys sexual 
assault treatment center 
the tests came after the arrest of preschool owner john w 
shaver 56 two weeks ago on five counts of possessing child 
pornography for magazines police found at his home across the 
street from his rainbow learning center 
police would not say whether the children who tested positive 
were male or female and did not release their ages 
police have said 20 children who attended shavers preschool 
were identified by their parents in hundreds of nude photographs 
found at shavers house the pictures do not depict sex acts or 
sexual poses but show the children at play authorities said 
this is an ongoing investigation and we cant answer any 
questions about the investigation itself police capt bruce 
smith said during a news conference late friday 
there is however no direct evidence linking the disease to 
the facility or shaver smith said 
police would not say whether shaver tested positive for the 
disease he remained under treatment friday at the crisis 
stabilization center in pembroke pines after cutting his wrist last 
week in an apparent suicide attempt 
shaver has denied any wrongdoing during the widening police 
investigation saying i have not behaved improperly to any 
child 
neither police nor joanne richter director of the treatment 
center could say how the children may have been infected 
the most likely hypothesis is they were forced to perform oral 
sex with the infected adult most likely a male said dr sally 
s atherton assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at 
the university of miami school of medicine its not something 
you pass around its a bacteria it requires contact 
the children have been treated police said most cases of 
gonorrhea can be cured with penicillin or other antibiotics 
especially if the disease is diagnosed early 
shaver was released on 5000 bond last week on the charges of 
possessing child pornography a thirddegree felony punishable by a 
maximum fiveyear prison sentence shaver has admitted owning the 
magazines but denies taking nude photographs of children 
although the photographs themselves are not pornographic under 
the law they could lead to sexual exploitation accusations against 
shaver if the evidence meets that criteria police have said 
police said they were being careful with the information they 
release about the case to prevent hysteria 
our no 1 concern is the children maj joe donisi said 
we dont want to traumatize the kids into thinking something has 
happened 
broward county officials shut down shavers daycare center last 
week contending shaver lacked good moral character about 200 
children have attended the center since shaver opened it in 1985 
for children ages 3 to 5

protesters upset over incidents stemming from 
the dismissal of a black superintendent promised to occupy selma 
high school and city hall until the majority white school board 
meets their demands 
many protesters planned to march today from a selma church to 
the edmund pettus bridge a landmark in the civil rights movement 
of 25 years ago and then spend a second night in the high school 
and city hall 
connie tucker a spokeswoman for the protests said the march 
would draw university students from across alabama the rev joseph 
lowery president of the southern christian leadership conference 
was expected to attend she said 
in 1965 state troopers attacked civil rights marchers on the 
bridge the marchers were on their way to a montgomery 
demonstration 
a federal judge citing the students right to freedom of 
speech turned down city attorneys friday who asked for him to 
intervene and block further disruptions at the buildings where the 
protests have been orderly 
us district judge charles butler of mobile told jl chestnut 
a lawyer for the protesters he was reluctant for the federal 
courts to step in but that excesses would force him to do so 
he told me he recognized constitutional rights to exercise 
free speech chestnut said 
chestnut said he told protest leaders of the judges concerns 
and indicated the buildings may be cleared by monday 
the racial turmoil began when six white members of the school 
board voted not to extend the contract of norward roussell the 
citys first black superintendent the dismissal of roussell last 
week ignited protests that led to the closing of two schools 
tuesday and all 11 of selmas public schools wednesday 
roussell was reinstated after the initial protests but the 
students want the school board to extend his contract which 
expires this year 
four blacks protesting the dismissal of roussell were arrested 
monday during a melee at the office of white mayor joe smitherman 
who held office during the turmoil of the 1960s 
a preliminary city report said allegations of police brutality 
at the protest was unfounded 
protesters also have pushed for commitments for a better 
education system for blacks 
state sen hank sanders said the main issue is not that 
schoolchildren missed days in the classroom at stake he said 
is the quality of education for the future

nearly 500 refugees from christian 
battles in lebanon arrived by ferry today at this port telling 
tales of dodging gunfire and of gunmen using civilians for cover 
the lebanese have done some futile things before but this 
must be the most futile ever said one passenger a british 
official of the fighting 
the clashes between rival christian forces have left more than 
400 people dead since jan 30 most victims have been civilians 
the ferry sunny boat steamed into larnaca on the south coast of 
cyprus after a ninehour 100mile overnight voyage from jounieh a 
christian town 10 miles north of beirut it was the first ferry to 
reach lebanon in a week 
the boat sailed for lebanon on friday after a shaky ceasefire 
was declared between rebel gen michel aouns troops and the 
lebanese forces militia of samir geagea despite the truce both 
sides clashed today 
many of the refugees came from christian districts of east 
beirut which have been the scene of fierce battles 
many had huddled in basements and bomb shelters for days and 
used the ceasefire to make a run for jounieh 
its been terrible with all the fighting that raged around 
us said hala habash a middleaged christian woman accompanied 
by two teenage children 
it was very dangerous during the fighting gunmen moved from 
house to house during the street fighting they took no notice of 
the people living in the houses said nawaz ephraim 19 who was 
accompanying his mother and two younger sisters 
sometimes they used the presence of noncombatants in the 
houses as cover he said 
a young mother with a little girl on her lap sat crying softly 
as she waited at the cypriot immigration desk for her passport to 
be stamped 
she refused to speak but a friend said she had been separated 
from her husband and a 10dayold baby during the fighting 
we dont know if theyre alive or dead the friend said 
a distraught middleaged woman with a heavily bandaged foot 
limped off the ferry and her husband who declined to be 
identified said she had been wounded in the fighting 
the british official one of two who said they were on official 
business at their embassy in beirut said the damage in dbaye had 
been quite extraordinary 
he was referring to a coastal town north of beirut that aouns 
forces wrested from the lebanese forces in handtohand fighting a 
week ago 
he said he and a companion had to drive to jounieh from beirut 
by a circuitous route over the mountains because the main coastal 
highway has been cut by the fighting

the united states and soviet union today announced 
preliminary agreement on an american plan for a phased elimination 
of the two sides chemical weapons 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said at a news 
conference at the end of three days of talks with us secretary of 
state james a baker iii that the soviets had accepted the us 
proposal and as a result of negotiations have agreed on a 
mutually acceptable draft of a prospective agreement of principle 
we believe such an agreement could be signed during president 
gorbachevs visit to the united states he added the soviet 
leader is scheduled to travel to washington in june to meet with 
president bush 
the announcement had been expected after bakers talks with 
shevardnadze and gorbachev 
in a joint statement the two sides pledged that after a 
multilateral treaty is reached in negotiations in geneva they will 
reduce their chemical weapons stocks to equal levels at a very 
small fraction of their present holdings over the first eight years 
of operation of the convention 
all remaining chemical weapons stocks should be eliminated 
over the subsequent two years the statement said 
the statement pledged the two sides to work out the last details 
even while a conference on banning chemical weapons continues in 
geneva 
in a speech to the un general assembly last year bush 
proposed to keep 2 percent of us stockpiles of weapons until all 
countries deemed capable of producing chemical weapons have signed 
an international treaty 
about a dozen countries including libya and iran are thought 
to possess chemical weapons although only the united states and 
soviet union admit having the deadly substances

a journalist closely tied to president hosni 
mubarak today criticized plo chief yasser arafat for failing to 
condemn a terrorist massacre of nine israelis on a bus in egypt 
the new criticism escalated a war of words over the attack 
between the palestine liberation organization and egypt 
jeopardizing efforts to organize israelpalestinian peace talks 
the article by editor ibrahim seda on the front page of the 
masscirculation weekly akhbar elyoms was the third article 
criticizing the plo since the attack sunday but it was the first 
that blamed arafat himself 
all three articles appeared in stateowned newspapers and were 
written by their top editors all known to be close to mubarak 
the media onslaught signaled strains in relations between egypt 
and the plo such tensions imperil american efforts to organize 
palestinianisraeli peace talks because egypt has been relaying plo 
positions to both the united states and israel 
israel outrage over the attack has also made organizing such 
talks more difficult 
mubarak sent a message to arafat this week that sources close to 
the government said was believed to have voiced displeasure over 
the plos reaction to the attack 
the plo said monday in tunisia that the incident should be 
placed in the context of the hundreds of palestinians who died in 
the 26monthold uprising against israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
in his article seda called the statement flimsy and silly 
for omitting a denunciation of the terrorist attack and comparing 
it to the violence in the occupied lands 
the bus carrying 31 israeli vacationers was attacked by two 
gunmen who showered it with automatic fire and hand grenades on a 
desert highway between cairo and the suez canal city of ismailia 
newspapers have quoted security officials as saying the gunmen were 
palestinians but that no arrests have been made 
we expected yasser arafat to react by flying to cairo 
immediately to declare to the world his personal and the 
palestinian peoples condemnation of this criminal act seda 
wrote in his weekly which claims a circulation of more than 1 
million 
he said arafat should at least have broadcast a statement in 
his own voice censuring the attack and vowing to help the 
egyptian security apparatus uncover the palestinian terrorist 
perpetrators 
the plos cairo representative saeed kamal told the middle 
east news agency today that his organization was cooperating with 
egyptian security authorities passing to them any information it 
had about the ambush 
however kamal said he could not rule out the possibility of 
israeli responsibility for the attack aiming to obstruct peace 
talks 
the chill in egyptianplo relations was the worst since mubarak 
shut down seven plo offices in egypt for seven months in 1987 after 
the palestine national council the organizations parliament in 
exile criticized cairos 1979 peace treaty with israel 
another stateowned newspaper alahram today reported that the 
ambush was plotted inside israel or the occupied territories 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified interior ministry official 
for the report

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany arrived in 
moscow today for talks aimed at reassuring the soviets that a 
reunited germany would not threaten their security 
kohl accompanied by foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
was to meet with president mikhail s gorbachev in one of a series 
of highlevel consultations planned in the east and west about 
german reunification 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told a news conference 
in moscow before kohls arrival that one of the key issues to be 
discussed was the need for a german guarantee on stable borders 
he also expressed support for a neutral demilitarized 
germany 
the chancellor has argued that soviet security interests would 
not be threatened if the two german states merged into a country of 
80 million people in the heart of europe 
after returning from the weekend talks in moscow kohl will meet 
in bonn with east german premier hans modrow see french president 
francois mitterrand and meet president bush in camp david all in 
one week 
the issue of unification has assumed urgency in recent days 
because of the instability of the east german economy 
with modrow kohl is expected to discuss plans to make the west 
german mark the currency in both states bonn hopes such a move 
would slow the exodus of people from east germany who have lost 
faith in their countrys future 
nearly 2000 east germans are leaving their country daily 
crippling an economy already troubled by strikes and absenteeism 
a highranking west german government official briefing 
reporters on kohls trip to moscow on the condition of anonymity 
said east germany could become insolvent in a matter of days he 
also said free elections already moved up from may to march 18 
might have to be advanced further 
the report was quickly denied by east german government 
spokesman wolfgang meyer and by kohls own spokesman hans klein 
klein said the bonn government did not think that east germanys 
economy is in danger of collapsing in the next few days but that 
some west german leaders believe that is the case 
the official who briefed reporters said the grim assessment was 
provided by some east german officials 
lothar de maiziere leader of the east german christian 
democratic party and one of modrows deputies in the cabinet was 
quoted by west germanys masscirculation newspaper bild as saying 
the situation in the country could become critical in two or three 
weeks 
since the ouster of hardline communist leader erich honecker in 
october and the opening of the berlin wall the following month 
reunification has become an urgent issue 
some europeans recalling nazi germanys march through europe in 
world war ii fear a united germany could again become a military 
threat 
genscher has sought to allay european fears by saying that both 
nations should soon sign an agreement not to build nuclear weapons 
or encroach on the borders of neighboring countries 
the superpowers worry that such a union could make their 
military alliances crumble nato has about 255000 troops in west 
germany most of them americans more than 380000 soviet soldiers 
are stationed in east germany a key member of the warsaw pact 
modrow has proposed that a united germany be neutral but 
western nations have uniformly rejected that stand 
officials in bonn have proposed that what is now west germany 
could remain with nato and the territory that was east germany 
could technically be neutral 
genscher also proposed that the 35nation conference on security 
and cooperation in europe meet in berlin this fall to discuss new 
security arrangements for europe

shipping pilots who steer oil tankers and 
freighters into los angeles harbor struck today over what they call 
unsafe working conditions that could trigger another massive oil 
spill 
at least one serious nearcollision at the heavily traveled port 
was due to conditions that included understaffing fatigue stress 
and the hurried training of newcomers said pilot capt joe silva 
president of the los angeles pilots association 
we could have a disaster silva said in a telephone 
interview today its totally unsafe to the public another 
valdez waiting to happen 
port capt james c card ordered closure to the harbor of 
vessels without a local pilot aboard the us coast guard said 
nine vessels were scheduled to enter the harbor this morning 
with two management pilot supervisors reportedly on hand to steer 
four of them to anchorages said coast guard petty officer carolyn 
feldman 
no immediate arrangements for the remaining five ships were made 
pilots voted friday night to walk off the job at 3 am today 
said wallace knox attorney for the masters mates amp pilots branch 
68 
dock workers were expected to honor the strike meaning the 
vessels brought into the harbor would be unable to berth ms 
feldman said 
telephone calls from the associated press to the harbor 
department seeking comment on the strike early today went 
unanswered 
the harbor department has been ordering a number of unsafe 
acts in the past several weeks and has been ordering untrained 
pilots to bring vessels into the harbor said knox 
he cited a nearcollision jan 24 between an oil tanker and 
another ship inside los angeles harbor 
the ships passed within 8 feet of each other forcing one pilot 
to drop anchor within the harbor channel rupturing a fuel pipeline 
in the process silva said 
despite such near misses the harbor department has persisted 
in irresponsible actions which raise serious safety concerns 
silva said 
silva said work weeks topping 84 hours were common 10 pilots 
often handled jobs designed for a staff of 16 and hiring officials 
were slow to fill vacancies prompting the rushed training of 
newcomers 
he said the harbor department had assigned the moving of vessels 
to a completely untrained trainee pilots had filed an action 
over the safety violations with the los angeles employee relations 
board he said 
branch 68 operates only in los angeles and none of its members 
was involved in this weeks huntington beach spill almost 300000 
gallons of alaska crude spilled from the tanker american trader on 
wednesday possibly after the tanker was gashed by its own anchor

us secretary of state james a baker iii 
challenged the soviet union on saturday to end military and 
financial support to marxist cuba and came under a blizzard of 
criticism from soviet officials about us arms spending and the 
invasion of panama 
the tough questionandanswer session in an unprecedented 
appearance before the soviet legislature contrasted with upbeat 
statements by both baker and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze on their three days of talks and an agreement on a 
us approach to banning chemical weapons 
the two sides agreed on a 10year phased elimination of their 
chemical weapons tied to an international agreement in geneva 
negotiations 
in an allusion to arthur koestlers novel about stalinism baker 
lectured his hosts about the darkness at noon era of the past 
and said the american people and congress cannot understand how the 
soviet government can send billions of rubles of assistance to 
countries like cuba and nicaragua 
not only were those countries supporting subversion in the 
western hemisphere baker said the soviet aid is even less 
comprehensible when it happens at a time when your people clearly 
need those scarce resources put to good use at home 
baker spoke in an 18th century ceremonial hall with a marble 
bust of lenin behind him his audience was the international 
affairs committee of the supreme soviet it was the first time a 
us government official had appeared in the legislative chamber 
an event baker attributed to reforms undertaken by president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
for over 40 years we have waged a cold war against one 
other baker said now is the time to put the legacy of 
struggle behind us now is the time to build a new legacy now 
is the time to move beyond the cold war 
shevardnadze in a news conference said a large measure of 
progress had been made in the talks on a variety of arms control 
issues and that an agreement on chemical weapons probably could be 
signed at the washington summit in june 
gorbachev in a nearly threehour meeting with baker on friday 
countered us president george bushs proposal for cutting the 
number of soldiers in central europe he urged bush to extend the 
plan to th entire continent including 30000 troops excluded by 
the us plan 
while complimenting the steps taken under gorbachev including 
the historic decision this week to end the communist partys 
monopoly on political power baker salted his speech with a thrust 
at soviet support for marxist countries 
three times baker called soviet support for cuba intolerable he 
complained about the shipment of new mig jet fighter planes and 
questioned why moscow was aiding president fidel castro when he is 
so critical of gorbachevs policies 
we remain especially disturbed by the military shipments your 
government continues to send to those seeking military solutions to 
conflicts in regions vital to us he said 
several committee members challenged baker on the invasion of 
panama and on several arms control fronts including us refusal 
to join the soviets in a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing or 
to consider naval disarmament 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev a military adviser to gorbachev 
said the united states at the end of world war ii had encircled the 
soviet union with military bases and had not retreated from that 
policy 
akhromeyev a leading figure in ussoviet arms control 
accords questioned why the us administration only trimmed 
defense spending while the soviets were cutting their defense 
budget by 14 percent as eastwest tensions ease 
yevgeny m primakov chairman of the soviet of the union one of 
the two chambers of the supreme soviet challenged the bush 
administration to join the soviet union in guaranteeing not to use 
force in latin america 
baker also was pressed to explain why us warships were exempt 
from arms control negotiations 
in reply baker returned to the issue of soviet support for cuba 
and nicaragua he said the military action in panama was unique and 
designed to remove gen manual noriega from power while restoring 
democracy 
the secretary of state also said a strong navy was essential to 
the united states which he described as sort of an island nation 
the 90minute session wound up bakers fourday visit to moscow 
which was capped by a gorbachev counterproposal to president bush 
on troop reductions in europe and headway toward arms control 
agreements 
baker then headed for bulgaria a soviet ally in the midst of a 
rocky evolution away from hardline communism he will stop sunday 
in romania which is undergoing an even rougher transition before 
traveling to ottawa canada for a meeting with the foreign 
ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw 
pact 
baker appeared before the committee after conducting marathon 
talks friday with gorbachev and other soviet officials during 
which he said progress was made toward agreements cutting 
longrange nuclear warheads and chemical weapons 
gorbachev urged the united states to remove 30000 more us 
troops from europe by extending bushs troop ceiling for europes 
central front to the entire continent 
among questions remaining after bakers talks with soviet 
leaders are the superpower differences over west and east germany 
the soviet union insists a unified germany should be neutral baker 
pressed the us position that a united germany should continue an 
association with nato 
on arms control baker said the two sides settled the questions 
of access to missile data during flight tests where to store 
nondeployed missiles and how many airlaunched cruise missiles may 
be carried by bombers but details about the range of those 
missiles remain unsettled he added 
the issues are part of negotiations on a treaty to slash 
longrange us and soviet nuclear missiles bombers and submarines 
that bush and gorbachev would like to sign at their summit meeting 
in washington in june

romanias embattled chief of 
broadcasting said today he was resigning because of intensifying 
political conflicts over the freedom of staterun television 
opposition members have accused the revolutionary government of 
using tv as a political weapon it has been one of the key issues 
as romania prepares for its first free multiparty elections since 
world war ii 
broadcasting chief aurel dragos munteanu said his goal had been 
to promote freedom of information and he worried that romanians 
had been so poisoned by the legacy of communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu that they looked for betrayal and hatred in every 
word even those spoken sincerely 
on jan 29 munteanu resigned as chief spokesman of the ruling 
council of the national salvation front in response to criticism by 
the opposition 
but almost daily demonstrations outside broadcasting 
headquarters since then also demanded his resignation as president 
of romanian radio and television saying he was too tied to the 
front which had decided to contest the elections in may 
protesters demanded that the freedom won during decembers 
revolution which toppled ceausescu be transferred to the tv screen 
munteanus letter of resignation published today on the front 
page of major newspapers drew bigger headlines than fridays first 
meeting of the new council of national unity which will run romania 
until elections 
in what was billed as perhaps the first democratically made 
decision in 40 years the new council of national unity agreed to 
expand from 180 to 259 members to provide a broad base for the new 
interim government 
the outgoing national salvation front agreed to the coalition 
government after protests of its decision to field candidates in 
the election the front which included many communist party 
veterans had ruled without opposition participation 
the consensus to increase the new bodys membership came after 
more than four hours of debate at the former national assembly 
building 
interim president ion iliescu who led the outgoing fronts 
ruling council presided over the meeting election of the new 
council president was apparently put off with iliescu a strong 
favorite 
this first meeting which was quite heated led to consensus 
and a final list of council members iliescu said at the end of 
the 7hour session 
an earlier decision to increase the council to 241 members was 
expanded to give even greater representation 
the assembly building is being used for the first time since the 
uprising against ceausescu who was overthrown dec 22 and executed 
three days later the council agreed to meet again tuesday 
the first four hours of debate friday centered on whether nine 
new parties registered in the last week should be given seats and 
on questions regarding the seating of ethnic groups 
in the expanded council 114 seats went to 38 parties 27 seats 
to nine organizations representing ethnic minorities three seats 
will be filled by former political prisoners and 114 seats go to 
prominent romanians from all walks of life who were part of the 
national salvation front the president is to fill the remaining 
seat 
before fridays session the legality of the decree creating the 
council was challenged by the national peasants party which 
opposed granting a large number of seats to former national front 
members it later dropped its challenge 
in another development a colonel awaiting trial on charges of 
complicity in genocide during the revolution committed suicide by 
hanging himself with his belt in a jail cell in timosoara the 
daily romania libera reported friday 
before his suicide col petre moraru told journalists of 
details of a clandestine operation to transfer the bodies of people 
killed in the first days of the revolt from timisoara to bucharest 
to be cremated 
also friday silviu brucan who resigned from the front 
leadership last month confirmed that some of ceausescus hated 
securitate secret police remained at large

secessionist rebels in the northern 
province of eritrea have launched a major new offensive 
threatening government access to a vital port and food shipments to 
millions of drought victims 
the offensive which the rebels said began thursday along a 
120mile front ended a nearly yearlong lull in fighting in the 
region and plunged all four of ethiopias northern provinces back 
into civil war 
the government confirmed the new fighting friday night and a 
government radio station in asmara the capital of eritrea said 
battles were raging today 
in a statement the ethiopian government said the renewed 
fighting has now dimmed the prospects of resolving the eritrean 
problem through the stalled peace talks and accused the rebels of 
using the peace talks as a subterfuge to prepare extensively for 
this destructive war 
but a senior eritrean official said today in jiddah saudi 
arabia that the rebels will meet ethiopian government envoys in 
the north yemen capital of sana on feb 15 in a new bid to resolve 
their 28yearold conflict 
saleh ahmed ayai deputy chairman of the eritrean liberation 
frontunified organization told the associated press the talks 
were in response to a mediation effort by north yemens president 
ali abdullah saleh 
the meeting had earlier been tentatively set for feb 1 but it 
was postponed when saleh visited the united states 
former president jimmy carter sponsored similar peace talks 
between another eritrean faction the eritrean peoples liberation 
front and the addis ababa government late last year in atlanta and 
in nairobi kenya 
the eritreans secessionist campaign is africas longestrunning 
conflict 
the new offensive also has jeopardized plans by the united 
nations to provide food in the next few months for an estimated 4 
million drought victims in northern ethiopia mostly in the 
provinces of eritrea and tigre 
the attack by the eritrean peoples liberation front came as the 
government appeared to be containing another offensive farther 
south by the tigre peoples liberation front a separate insurgent 
group 
the government said the eritrean rebels main objective appeared 
to be the capture of massawa the largest of only two ports on 
ethiopias red sea coast the other is at asab near the countrys 
border with djibouti 
in a clandestine radio broadcast the rebels said they had taken 
control of the road from asmara to massawa 40 miles northeast of 
the provincial capital in what they described as a crushing 
offensive 
the operation was very broad and and swift and the victory 
very great said the voice of the broad masses of eritrea it 
claimed rebel forces had scattered the government army deployed 
along the road 
the eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence for 
their province once an italian colony since 1961 in what has 
become africas oldest war 
the tigrean rebels based in the province just south of eritrea 
launched their own offensive in august pushing government troops 
out of their last remaining strongholds in tigre and sweeping south 
and east into the provinces of wollo and gondor 
the government declared a mass mobilization in september in a 
counteroffensive in january it recaptured some of the towns and 
garrisons taken earlier by the tigrean insurgents 
although their aims are different the eritrean and tigrean 
rebels have coordinated attacks against the government in the past 
the tigreans unlike the eritreans seek the complete overthrow 
of the marxist regime of president mengistu haile marian and its 
replacement with what they describe as a government modeled after 
that of albania the last hardline communist government in eastern 
europe

rival christian forces clashed with 
artillery and machine guns today in violation of a ceasefire in 
their 12dayold power struggle frightened rescuers left corpses 
to rot in beiruts streets 
by police count at least 433 people have been killed and 1684 
wounded most of them civilians since the battle for leadership of 
an estimated 1 million christians broke out jan 30 the fighters 
have not given rescuers guarantees to remove bodies that have been 
in the streets for days 
gen michel aouns troops and the lebanese forces militia 
commanded by samir geagea appeared to be gearing up for more 
savage attacks 
an antiaoun christian radio station reported a mutiny among his 
19000 troops one week after 1000 soldiers defected to the 
lebanese forces or to a moslem commander in west beirut todays 
report could not be immediately verified 
the two sides clashed during the night and early morning with 
machine guns in several districts of christian east beirut snipers 
dueled constantly three people were killed and four wounded during 
heavy shelling police said 
the situation does not indicate that the ceasefires going to 
hold said a police spokesman who cannot be identified under 
standing regulations 
aouns gunners bombarded a militia unit that blew up the daraya 
bridge northeast of beirut 
geageas gunners responded with heavy shelling to cover the 
units withdrawal the police spokesman said 
he said geageas artillery also shelled aouns howitzer 
emplacements in the bekfaya region north of beirut 
geageas headquarters said in a communique that aouns artillery 
was shelling population centers in northern kesrouan province 
this months fighting has been the bloodiest between christian 
forces since lebanons civil war began in 1975 
the police spokesman said several decomposing corpses remained 
in streets that form a nomans land between geageas men and 
aouns troops in east beirut 
civil defense teams havent been able to obtain guarantees 
from both sides that they wont shoot at them while evacuating the 
corpses the spokesman said 
civil defense officials believe some of the corpses are 
boobytrapped and thats why the combatants want to keep them 
there he added 
the police spokesman reported no progress in efforts to put into 
effect a truce worked out friday by representatives of both sides 
aoun has accused geagea of trying to enforce an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan to end the nations civil war the 
october accord worked out by lebanese legislators in saudi arabia 
led to the formation of a government under president elias hrawi 
also a christian 
aoun attacked the pact because it set no date for withdrawal of 
the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon aoun who was appointed last 
year to head an interim cabinet has refused to acknowledge hrawis 
government or obey his orders to quit his army post 
the syrian soldiers who control most of the country were 
deployed in lebanon in 1976 under an arab league mandate to quell 
fighting between moslems and christians 
however aoun says they violated their peacekeeping mandate by 
siding with the moslems

hundreds of workers and 
volunteers sopped up oily goo tarnishing miles of scenic beaches 
and boats skimmed crude from the water as the expanding slick from 
a ruptured tanker drifted northward 
the cleanup effort friday seemed no match for the spill of up to 
300000 gallons from the 811foot american trader methods to soak 
up the slippery viscous goo were inefficient some said 
this is a small oil spill said filmmaker jeanmichel 
cousteau son of renowned oceanographer jacques cousteau we 
dont know how to pick it up we do not have the technology we are 
not prepared 
the midweek spill from the british petroleumoperated tanker 
left oily globules along 18 miles of coastline from seal beach to 
newport beach where a dark brown tide marred the citys beaches 
officials there declared a state of emergency 
by morning southerly winds had blown the oil slick northward 
over two more miles of ocean lengthening it to 12 miles long 
medium concentrations of frothy windwhipped oil washed ashore 
along three miles of huntington beach said coast guard petty 
officer dennis hall 
winds turned offshore by sunrise sending fingers of the slick 
reaching westward expanding its width to 3 miles according to 
updated overflight charts 
hall said the slick reached northward to the long beach 
breakwater near anaheim bay he said long beach is a major ocean 
port adjacent to los angeles harbor another heavily traveled sea 
port a long breakwater protects both 
meanwhile los angeles harbor pilots struck today to protest 
what they called unsafe working conditions caused by fatigue and 
untrained pilots those pilots were not involved in the spill to 
the south in huntington beach 
two management pilot supervisors planned to steer four of nine 
scheduled tankers into port today but the ships would have to wait 
at offshore anchorages because dock workers honored the pilots 
strike the coast guard said 
several hundred workers hired by the oil shipper and an equal 
number of volunteers worked around the clock to soak up the goo at 
newport beach they filled hundreds of trash bags with towels 
fouled sand and oil 
are we out of the woods no not yet said charles webster 
crisis manager for british petroleum but were working to stay 
ahead of the curve 
workers in yellow waterproof gear combed the muck overnight near 
the huntington beach pier with a backhoe blotted oil with 
absorbent pads and dragged blue plastic pompons across the beach to 
soaked up oily pools 
residents scoured the sand with brooms and dust pans and carried 
oilsoaked sea birds to an emergency station but cleanup 
officials worried about chemical hazards and liability urged them 
to leave the job to hired crews 
british petroleum said 390 cleanup workers were cleaning a 
20mile coastal stretch from bolsa chica to laguna beach nine 
skimmers were at work on the slick a mile offshore and others were 
en route 
fiftyfour oilsoaked birds including 11 dead were reported 
friday by susan rimerman spokeswoman for international bird rescue 
and research a group hired by the state fish and game department 
department biologist john grant said 12 birds had died 
there were no reports of oil entering the wildlife habitats of 
the bolsa chica wetlands the santa ana river mouth and upper 
newport bay where booms blocked their entrances 
but there was concern the slick might drift south to laguna 
beach the scenic art colony fronted by rocky tide pools teeming 
with marine life webster said a cleanup company was placed on call 
there 
the coast guard pumped out 1 million gallons of oil still inside 
the forward hold of the tanker officials said the american trader 
which carried 21 million gallons of crude may have been gashed by 
its own anchor on wednesday as it tried to moor near a pipeline 
cousteau who flew over the slick early friday said the 
skimming equipment aboard the boats was not working 
you look at skimmers everybody is working very hard 
cousteau said it goes right under the boom i mean i filmed 
it there we are not being efficient and we do not have the 
technology to be efficient 
john turner director of the us fish and wildlife service 
said good weather had kept the slick offshore and available 
resources had helped cleanup efforts 
to date weve been lucky turner said but he warned that 
theres a lot of oil that could come ashore 
he said chemical dispersants would not be used due to the 
slicks proximity to shore and the potential danger of toxicity to 
animals fines and penalties were under consideration because of 
the dead and injured birds he said

nelson mandela given a life 
sentence for plotting to overthrow the south african government 
became the worlds most influential prisoner during what he 
described as long lonely wasted years 
mandela was unheard and unseen by the public since 1962 but 
nevertheless he came to be the most admired leader among south 
african blacks who consider him the embodiment of their quest for 
political freedom 
he rejected the governments repeated offers to release him if 
he would renounce violence or live in a tribal homeland he said 
the government should renounce violence end apartheid and lift the 
ban on his movement the african national congress 
president fw de klerk legalized the anc and 60 other 
organizations on feb 2 and announced mandela would be freed soon 
although apartheid and restrictive security laws remained in place 
in the meantime mandela had met regularly with government 
officials during the past year and issued statements saying he 
wanted to work for peace 
today de klerk announced that mandela 71 would be released 
unconditionally sunday 
after his historic meeting on july 5 1989 with president pw 
botha a statement by mandela was released by the prisons service 
and broadcast on governmentrun radio and television 
he said he had not deviated from the position i have taken 
over the past 28 years namely that dialogue with the mass 
democratic movement and in particular with the african national 
congress is the only way of ending violence and bringing peace to 
our country 
i only would like to contribute to the creation of a climate 
which would promote peace in south africa mandela said 
de klerk replaced botha in august 1989 and met with mandela at 
his cape town office on dec 13 1989 amid intense expectations 
that the prisoner would be freed in the new year 
mandela regularly entertained his family and streams of friends 
in a comfortable house at the victor verster prison farm in the 
winegrowing region of paarl he had been transferred there on dec 
6 1988 after recovering from tuberculosis contracted at pollsmoor 
prison in cape town in august 
expectations of his release had been raised before but each 
time the government balked at freeing the man many blacks believed 
should be their president 
former information minister stoffel van der merwe said in july 
1988 that mandela had served enough time to pay for his crimes and 
that the only thing keeping him in prison was the governments 
uncertainty about the effect he would have on politics and national 
security 
it was a tacit admission of what botha had denied for years 
that mandela was a political prisoner 
in 1985 botha allowed zindzi mandela to read her fathers 
response to the latest offer of conditional release before a crowd 
in soweto the township outside johannesburg where mandela had 
rented a home since the 1940s 
only free men can negotiate prisoners cannot enter into 
contracts mandela said i cherish my own freedom dearly but i 
care even more for your freedom too many have died since i went to 
prison too many have suffered for the love of freedom not only i 
have suffered during these long lonely wasted years 
during his imprisonment mandela was regarded as the leader of 
the african national congress although the highest office he held 
before it was banned in 1960 was deputy presidentgeneral 
he was the first commander of its military wing spear of the 
nation which he helped form in 1961 to engage in a program of 
sabotage 
he subsequently toured africa receiving military training and 
explaining the ancs cause he was arrested after his return in 
1962 and sentenced to five years hard labor for leaving the 
country illegally and inciting blacks to violate the law by 
striking 
mandela told the court that when his sentence was ended he would 
take up again as best i can the struggle for the removal of 
those injustices until they are finally abolished once and for 
all 
i have no doubt that posterity will pronounce that i was 
innocent and that the criminals that should have been brought 
before this court are the members of the government he said 
in july 1963 while mandela was at the robben island 
maximumsecurity prison near cape town police uncovered the ancs 
underground headquarters on a farm near johannesburg and seized 
documents outlining plans for the guerrilla campaign including 
mandelas diary in june 1964 he and seven codefendants were 
sentenced to life in prison 
i do not deny that i planned sabotage he said in his 
statement from the dock i did not plan it in a spirit of 
recklessness nor because i have any love of violence i planned it 
as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political 
situation that had arisen after years of tyranny exploitation and 
oppression of my people by whites 
he said he cherished the ideal of a democratic and free 
society in which all persons live together in harmony and with 
equal opportunities it is an ideal which i hope to live for 
and achieve but if need be an ideal for which i am prepared to 
die 
his wife winnie jailed or banished through much of his 
imprisonment said in each and every single letter he has 
written over the past 20 years and in each and every visit he has 
always been confident that he will come out and lead his people to 
liberation

during most of his 18 years on robben island mandela endured 
substandard food deprivation of news and reading material and 
hard labor that included gathering seaweed and smashing rock yet 
he often wrote his wife that the hardest thing to endure was the 
treatment she received 
he wrote that he sometimes wondered whether any kind of 
commitment can ever be sufficient excuse for abandoning a young and 
inexperienced woman in a pitiless desert 
in april 1982 mandela and five colleagues were transferred to 
pollsmoor prison in a white suburb outside cape town they shared a 
large cell where mandela cultivated a vegetable garden and 
complained about the conditions he was allowed to pursue his 
studies for an advanced law degree which he received in early 
1989 and eventually began receiving uncensored newspapers and 
radio reports 
mandelas communications with his wife and family were

one year after he was driven into hiding by an 
islamic death sentence salman rushdie has begun to fight back 
with a long interview and an essay in a sunday newspaper plus a 
lecture written from hiding the 42yearold author is mounting a 
vigorous unapologetic defense of the satanic verses and shows 
no inclination to bow to pressure to back down 
that pressure is manifesting itself in a heated debate about 
whether the satanic verses should be published in paperback 
yes says rushdie no say those who fear it will lead to moslem 
unrest 
the opponents include lawmakers writers and relatives of 
british hostages in lebanon free speech has its limits they say 
and a paperback edition would only worsen a conflict that has 
already damaged anglomoslem relations and led to deadly rioting 
some of rushdies supporters worry that the furor that greeted 
the death sentence imposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran 
last feb 14 is dissipating 
there has been this gradual shift into considering rushdie 
as a criminal from someone to be supported heres someone who 
caused disquiet unrest said frances dsouza head of the 
international committee for the defense of salman rushdie and his 
publishers 
the issue has domestic political implications too the 
opposition labor party which rushdie always supported is torn 
between the principle of free speech and the fear of losing moslem 
votes 
rushdie acknowledges his book has caused pain but appeals to 
moderate moslems to reconsider their campaign the bombayborn 
briton says he renounced islam in his youth and therefore cannot 
be accused of blasphemy or reneging on his faith 
if the uproar represents the conflict between islamic 
fundamentalism and western libertarianism rushdie is firmly on the 
side of the west 
his lecture at the institute of contemporary art delivered by 
playwright harold pinter and attended by a host of literary 
heavyweights cited an array of writers through the ages to defend 
free speech and decry religious absolutism 
the true believer knows that he is simply right and you are 
wrong he will seek to convert you even by force or despise 
you for your unbelief he wrote 
within days of the publication of the satanic verses in 
september 1988 moslems were claiming it insulted the prophet 
mohammed by associating him with prostitutes and the koran their 
holy book by suggesting it was mans work not allahs 
the worldwide protests and bookburnings and the deadly riots 
in pakistan and india culminated in iran promising a 
multimilliondollar reward for anyone who killed rushdie khomeini 
died in june but the edict stands 
rushdie was at his north london home last valentines day when 
the british broadcasting corp told him of khomeinis edict the 
same day rushdie dropped out of sight with his wife american 
novelist marianne wiggins 
since then he has been under roundtheclock armed guard at a 
series of houses operated by special branch security police and 
mi5 the domestic intelligence agency 
ms wiggins moved out in august she denies there were marital 
difficulties rushdie confined himself to publishing occasional 
book reviews but stayed out of the debate on his book saying he 
felt his silence would be more eloquent 
the satanic verses has sold more than 1 million copies in 
english almost threequarters of those in the united states and 
has been on the sunday times of london bestseller list for 49 weeks 
it has been translated into 15 other languages and been banned 
in more than 20 countries 
writers and commentators initially rallied to rushdies defense 
with 2500 worldwide signing a petition 
but in recent weeks spy writer john le carre and liberal 
political columnist hugo young have openly pressed rushdie to 
abandon the paperback edition 
rushdie maintains the paperback is essential if his book is to 
last for posterity 
without a paperback in a few years the book simply wont be 
there for anyone who wants to read it he told the independent on 
sunday it will in all practical terms have been suppressed 
but writing in the leftleaning guardian newspaper le carre 
said nobody has a godgiven right to insult a great religion and 
be published with impunity 
young a guardian columnist urged rushdie to renounce the 
paperback on the deeply considered grounds that it could do more 
harm than good 
relatives of british hostages issued a statement saying 
paperback publication would be misconceived and irresponsible 
and could make conditions worse for the captives believed held by 
moslem extremists 
viking penguin says no firm date has been set for paperback 
publication the publishers have reason to be evasive khomeinis 
death sentence extended to them too and they have received 35000 
abusive or threatening letters and 45 bomb threats in britain and 
the united states says spokesman bob gregory 
the companys british headquarters have been evacuated six 
times and five incendiary devices have been found in its stores 
two of which exploded worldwide security measures cost 34 
million a year gregory said 
in a 7000word essay for the independent on sunday rushdie 
touched on his lonely existence and the shock of being condemned by 
moslems for what he thought was a sympathetic account of their 
plight as immigrants in the west 
do i feel regret of course i do regret that such offense has 
been taken against my work when it was not intended rushdie 
wrote 
would i have written it differently if i had known what would 
happen truthfully i dont know would i change any of the text 
now i would not its too late

president bush welcomed the announcement today 
that black activist nelson mandela will be freed praising south 
african president fw de klerk for bold and imaginative 
leadership 
i welcome this move and view it as another significant step on 
the road to the nonracial democratic south africa which we all 
desire bush said in a statement released from camp david md 
where he is spending the weekend at the presidential retreat 
bush reiterated his intention to invite mandela and de klerk to 
the white house in separate visits some critics on capitol hill 
have said de klerk should not be welcomed as long as his nation 
retains its system of racial separation known as apartheid 
president de klerk has shown bold and imaginative leadership 
in recent days which has earned the admiration of many of us who 
hope for swift and peaceful evolution in south africa bush said 
he made no mention of whether the release of mandela after years 
as a political prisoner would cause the administration to push for 
easing of us sanctions against pretoria

to john odonnell the allegations of sexual 
misconduct against the rev bruce ritter are beside the point the 
point he says is that covenant house gives him a clean place to 
sleep each night 
he feeds us he clothes us and were behind him 100 percent 
said odonnell 20 who found shelter at covenant house two weeks 
ago after he and his mother were evicted hes the nicest guy in 
the world and i aint even met him but someday i will and im 
going to shake his hand 
the day before ritter had stepped down as executive director of 
covenant house pending an investigation by the franciscans the 
order of roman catholic priests to which ritter belongs of charges 
that he had had sexual relations with several youths who had sought 
his help 
ritter dismisses the allegations as garbage and odonnell 
and many of his fellow covenant house residents agree even those 
who think ritters accusers could be telling the truth say it 
doesnt diminish their gratitude for a man whose work changed their 
lives 
excuse my language but regardless if hes a homosexual or 
not hes doing the right thing for us said mitchell dedes 20 
as he stood outside the covenant house shelter a few blocks from 
times square and a block from the port authority bus terminal both 
are magnets for homeless youths 
we get three meals a day he said my clothes have been 
washed clean i was out on the streets about four weeks after i 
lost my job now i sleep in a room with a bed where the sheets get 
changed 
covenant house began in 1968 when ritter now 62 put a few 
runaways up in his apartment it now serves 25000 youths annually 
at 17 shelters in the united states canada and latin america 
nearly all of its 85 millionayear budget is funded by private 
donations in his letters to potential donors ritter details the 
lives of youths who leave abusive homes for a street life of drugs 
and prostitution but finally find peace at covenant house 
since the controversy began contributions are said to have 
fallen off as ritter a man who is accustomed to laudatory 
coverage who was celebrated by president reagan as a hero makes 
headlines of a different sort 
the charges against ritter first arose in december when the new 
york post quoted a onetime male prostitute as saying he had had an 
affair with ritter over several months last year the young mans 
father defended ritter calling his son an emotionally troubled 
liar 
then in january the village voice a new york weekly 
newspaper said a second young man had claimed during a 1986 
interview that he had had sex with ritter the interview was not 
published at that time last week two other young men were quoted 
in published reports as saying they had had affairs with ritter 
on tuesday the franciscans said they had instructed ritter to 
step down temporarily from the covenant house post while the 
allegations were investigated and the manhattan district 
attorneys office is investigating whether covenant house funds 
were misused 
i think the media has tried to exploit the negative said 
reginald lewis 22 who ran away from his oakland calif home at 
age 17 and spent nine months at covenant house before recently 
getting a place of his own and a job as a computer operator 
the accusations against ritter he added are unimportant the 
philosophy behind what father ritter has done is whats important 
why dont they talk about the good things hes done 
complained nina spear 19 who came to covenant house 2 months ago 
after living on the street for 2 years she left her home on 
staten island because she said her life was messed up drugs 
family 
at covenant house she said they teach us discipline 
selfrespect respect for others instead of sleeping on the 
subway you sleep in a bed 
andrew escalet 21 who has been at covenant house for more than 
a year and hopes to be on his own by may said i dont feel any 
disappointment i feel its irrelevant theres people that do so 
much worse in this world 
escalets family kicked him out of his house in the bronx two 
years ago i stayed with friends he recalled several times 
i stayed out in the parks and slept in a box got to a time when i 
needed some sort of rescue it wasnt nobody else but covenant 
house 
escalet now working for a pianomoving company and studying for 
his highschool diploma said when he talks to ritter about his 
problems the priest exhibits a tremendous amount of 
understanding caring thats important if he can have that much 
understanding for me i can have that for him 
with the voice of experience he added it only takes one time 
for you to mess up but it takes many many good things for them to 
realize youre good

congress edged rightward in 1989 despite 
flashes of courage on abortion flag burning and capital gains 
taxes the liberal americans for democratic action says 
a compilation of voting records on 20 key issues by the ada 
showed an average 50 percent approval of the liberal position in 
the house down from 52 percent in 1988 and a decline from 52 
percent to 48 percent of liberal causes in the senate 
the organizations national director amy issacs said liberals 
rarely had the votes to pass even moderate legislation over 
president bushs 10 kinder gentler vetoes in fact it passed 
none 
the first session of the 101st congress was often spent in 
wrangling often ugly debate on issues that had little to do with 
its real business passing laws ms issacs said while all 
this made for wonderful newspaper copy it did little to address 
the nations business 
with 100 percent right votes on the 20 issues the group 
hailed sens paul simon dill and patrick leahy dvermont as 
its liberal champions in the senate 
rep don edwards dcalif who has enjoyed perfect proliberal 
ada ratings since 1982 led a contingency of 25 house members with 
a 100 percent liberal voting records last year as compiled by the 
ada and released this week all 25 are democrats 
nine senate republicans and 39 gop members in the house scored 
zero ratings 
house democrats had an average 73 percent proliberal voting 
record compared with 70 percent for their party colleagues in the 
senate republicans compiled 15 percent right votes in both the 
house and senate 
democratic party leaders were more liberal 93 percent in the 
house and 75 percent in the senate than members of their party as 
a whole gop leaders were more conservative with average rankings 
of 5 percent in the house and 8 percent in the senate 
house democratic committee chairman were slightly more liberal 
77 percent than their party colleagues however senate 
democratic committee chairmen were slightly more conservative with 
an average 66 percent rating 
but ranking committee republicans in both the house and senate 
had much more liberal voting records a 22 percent average than 
the partys leaders and its members in congress as a lot 
lawmakers from massachusetts had the most liberal ratings 
averaging 89 percent followed by those from north dakota at 80 
percent connecticut 74 percent west virginia 73 percent and

eight bombs exploded in srinagar on 
saturday and moslem separatists urged city residents to 
demonstrate in the streets to mark the sixth anniversary of the 
execution of a militant leader 
police increased security and said srinagar would be under 
curfew throughout sunday the anniversary of mohammad maqbool 
butts death 
butt the founder of the militant jammukashmir liberation 
front was hanged in new delhis tihar jail on feb 11 1984 for 
the 1965 murder of an intelligence agent in kashmir 
butt was convicted in 1967 but he escaped from a srinagar jail 
in 1968 he was rearrested in 1979 and remained in jail until his 
execution 
the jammukashmir liberation front is spearheading a violent 
campaign for secession of the himalayan state of jammukashmir the 
countrys only moslem majority state from the predominantly hindu 
india 
the movement is centered in srinagar the summer capital of 
jammukashmir state and its largest city jammu region south of 
kashmir is hindu dominated 
at least 82 people have died in the latest round of secessionist 
violence that flared jan 20 when moslem militants took to the 
streets and clashed with security forces most victims were 
protesters shot for defying curfew 
curfew had been restricted to night hours since jan 26 because 
authorities said the situation had stabilized but it was clamped 
on the city at 11 am saturday after the bomb blasts 
police officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
blasts occurred outside two banks a post office and other shops 
and businesses they said no one was injured 
no one claimed responsibility but the officials blamed the 
separatists 
curfew was strictly enforced and streets remained deserted 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
wall posters that exhorted people to mark butts execution were 
being removed 
some of the posters said come out and demonstrate in memory 
of martyr maqbool butt who laid down his life for the cause of 
liberation of kashmir 
witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said dozens of 
army trucks carrying soldiers rolled into srinagar late friday 
apparently to counter possible violence sunday 
the city of 1 million was virtually sealed 
troops with machine guns patrolled the outskirts all vehicles 
entering the city were stopped and searched all travelers were 
told to leave vehicles and stood in lines with their hands raised 
to be searched

militants pakistan denies the charge and says the kashmiris have 
the right to selfdetermination the countries have fought two wars 
over kashmir 
pakistans prime minister benazir bhutto appeared to issue a 
veiled threat saturday in a speech to parliament about the kashmir 
situation 
we want a peaceful solution but at the same time pakistan 
cannot be intimidated ms bhutto told pakistani lawmakers we 
know how to defend our freedom and independence she said 
ms bhutto accused india of blaming pakistan for the violence

became part of jammukashmir

nelson mandela the symbol of 
unyielding black resistance to apartheid will go free sunday after 
more than 27 years in prison president fw de klerk announced 
today 
tomorrow will bring us to the end of a long chapter de 
klerk told a news conference he said he conferred with mandela on 
friday night and was convinced the black leader is committed to a 
peaceful resolution of the racial conflict that has plagued south 
africa for decades 
the president also said the 3yearold state of emergency would 
be lifted in a few weeks if no unrest accompanies mandelas 
release and he pledged to negotiate the possible release of 
remaining political prisoners 
mandela in recent talks with the government had demanded 
freedom for all political prisoners and an end to the emergency 
which still allows police to detain suspects for up to six months 
without charge ban protests and bar journalists and the general 
public from protests and areas of unrest 
the release of the worlds bestknown political prisoner has 
long been viewed as the crucial step needed to end south africas 
political stalemate and clear the way for negotiations on power 
sharing between blacks and whites after decades of racial conflict 
there can no longer be any doubt about the governments 
sincerity in seeking to create a just dispensation based on 
negotiations de klerk said 
the eyes of the world are presently focused on all south 
africans all of us now have an opportunity and the responsibility 
to prove that we are capable of a peaceful process of creating a 
new south africa 
de klerk who stunned south africans on feb 2 by lifting a 
30year ban on mandelas african national congress said the 
71yearold black leader would be freed unconditionally at 3 pm 
sunday 8 am est at the gates of victor verster prison farm 
outside cape town 
in lusaka zambia the ancs headquartersinexile the news was 
greeted with jubiliation i can hardly believe it said anc 
executive committee member james stuart its a great victory for 
our people 
de klerk said i hope that now that this chapter has ended 
the world and more especially the people of south africa will grasp 
the opportunity and play whatever supportive role can be played 
toward a peaceful conclusion 
the government has expressed fears about mandelas safety in 
light of reported death threats from right and leftwing 
extremists de klerk said the matter of security was being 
discussed with mandelas colleagues but added when he is 
released he becomes a free man he doesnt owe it to me to inform 
us about his program 
asked whether mandelas release along with the earlier 
concessions would bring about an end to western sanctions against 
south africa de klerk replied we are not working against 
checklists we are doing what we believe is in the best interests 
of south africa 
he said his discussion with the black leader had been amicable 
and described him as dignified 
mandelas wide winnie was at the family home in the black 
township of soweto outside johannesburg and made no immediate 
statement 
these are incredible days in which we are living said 
archbishop desmond tutu a major antiapartheid leader abc news 
showed the ecstatic tutu at his home near soweto with other mandela 
supporters jumping up and down dancing and singing after news of 
the release was announced 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for helping plan the start of the ancs guerrilla 
campaign many south african blacks consider him their paramount 
leader and he would be a favorite to win the presidency if blacks 
could vote 
de klerk in his historic speech feb 2 lifted bans and 
restrictions on dozens of opposition groups scrapped some 
stateofemergency regulations declared a moratorium on hangings 
and said the government would free mandela unconditionally as soon 
as possible 
however he made no mention of dismantling apartheid the system 
of racial discrimination under which the 28million member black 
majority is denied a say in national affairs by the 5million 
member white minority 
de klerks predecessor pw botha had offered to free mandela 
in exchange for a public renunciation of violence mandela refused 
saying the burden was on the government to legalize the anc scrap 
segregation laws and agree to political negotiations 
de klerk who succeeded botha in august has proposed 
negotiations with black leaders on a new constitution that would 
extend political rights to the disenfranchised black majority 
mandela quartered at a comfortable house at victor verster has 
been meeting regularly with a wide range of government officials 
and antiapartheid activists in recent months 
the government has indicated it would accept his offer to serve 
as mediator if talks with the anc take place 
concessions announced by de klerk in his speech met most of the 
ancs conditions for negotiations the organization says de klerk 
still must lift the state of emergency and free all political 
prisoners including those convicted of violent acts 
in his speech de klerk lifted longterm bans on the south 
african communist party and on the pan africanist congress a 
guerrilla movement smaller than the anc and less open to a role for 
whites in the liberation struggle 
a senior pan africanist leader barney desai today became the 
firstlong term political exile to return to south africa in the 
wake of de klerks announcement desai 57 went into exile in 1962 
while facing proscecution for defying restrictions placed on him by 
police

the birth control pill ushered in the sexual 
revolution 30 years ago but there have been so few new 
contraceptives marketed in the united states since then that 
american women now find their choices limited 
we clearly have less available than other places said rep 
pat schroeder dcolo ticking off a list of contraceptives 
unavailable in the united states that includes longacting hormonal 
implants and injectables as well as the french abortion pill 
ru486 
planned parenthood federation of america is trying to build 
support for more contraceptive research with a series of 
conferences around the country including one scheduled monday in 
boston 
a joint committee of the national research council and the 
institute of medicine will release a report wednesday on the 
regulatory climate for development of new contraceptives 
more than 13 million american women use oral contraceptives 
known collectively as the pill 
used correctly the pill is 99 percent effective but its 
existence does not mean it can be used safely and effectively by 
everyone said rebecca stone director of public policy for the 
private center for population options 
the pill has some minor side effects must be taken daily and 
its not recommended for smokers over 35 and women with a history 
of bloodclotting disorders heart disease breast cancer 
estrogendependent tumors undiagnosed genital bleeding and a few 
other conditions 
in 1987 more than 8 million american women of reproductive age 
chose to be sterilized as a method of birth control while 69 
million relied on condoms 17 million used diaphragms 12 million 
chose spermicides 11 million had iuds and 11 million used 
contraceptive sponges 
also 23 million relied on withdrawal before ejaculation 17 
million used periodic abstinence and 33 million used nothing 
according to the alan guttmacher institute a private education and 
research group 
the food and drug administration soon is expected to approve a 
device called norplant which prevents pregnancy for up to five 
years 
the silicone rubber capsules each the size of a wooden 
matchstick are implanted in a womans upper arm but can be removed 
at any time to restore fertility it already is on the market in 12 
countries and is being tested in 40 others 
when the pill became available in the united states in 1960 
researchers predicted it was just the beginning that soon there 
would be more options including vaccines and a pill for men 
thirty years later the search for better contraceptives 
continues but the pace has slowed to a crawl 
in the early 1970s there were 13 major pharmaceutical companies 
eight in the united states conducting contraceptive research 
today there are three and only one is a us company ortho 
pharmaceutical corp 
a few smaller companies and nonprofit organizations are doing 
research 
the upjohn co fought a nearly 20year battle in an unsuccessful 
effort to win fda approval of depoprovera as a longacting 
injectable contraceptive it was opposed both by the religious 
right and feminist health groups that cited possible cancer risks 
depoprovera has been approved in more than 60 countries as a 
contraceptive including the united kingdom west germany norway 
sweden france and belgium it is approved in the united states to 
treat endometrial and renal cancers and because it is an approved 
drug some physicians do prescribe it as a contraceptive 
however doctors prescribing any drug for any other than its 
labeled use can face greater risk of liability 
some say the controversy over depoprovera helped chill the 
research climate but the fear of lawsuits is the most frequently 
cited reason for the dropoff in efforts to find new contraceptives 
other factors include insufficient federal funding high cost a 
cumbersome government approval process and spillover from the 
antiabortion movement 
stung by the fallout from ah robins cos intrauterine device 
the dalkon shield gd searle amp co went to court 19 times to 
defend its copper 7 iud plaintiffs alleged that the dalkon shield 
caused infections that led to infertility spontaneous abortions 
and in some cases death 
searle won 15 of the suits but discontinued its iud in 1986 
because it could no longer get liability insurance said 
spokeswoman kay bruno 
the ultimate loser is the american woman who doesnt have 
these options in contraception anymore bruno said 
only alza corps progestasert iud remained on the market after 
the dalkon shield controversy and only one new iud had been 
introduced since paragard made by gynopharma inc 
the government through the national institute of child health 
and human development and the agency for international development 
will spend about 20 million in 1990 on contraceptive research 
and development 
when other contraceptiverelated research is added such as 
evaluating existing birth control methods the total rises to about 
30 million 
dr gabriel bialy chief of the contraceptive development branch 
at the institute said research funds have been inadequate for 
years 
contraceptive development does not have too much political 
clout bialy said however he doesnt attribute the lack of 
interest to pressure from antiabortion groups some of which also 
oppose contraception 
we were not terribly popular even in the era of more liberal 
administrations 
others however say abortion politics is having an impact 
antiabortion forces persuaded congress in the 1970s to prohibit 
funding of research into contraceptive methods that work after 
pregnancy including the french abortion pill ru486 
ru486 approved in france and china can act after the 
implantation of a fertilized egg in france the pill cannot be 
used beyond the fifth week after fertilization or three weeks 
after a missed menstrual period 
a woman takes the drug orally and two days later is given an 
injection or suppository of synthetic prostaglandin which causes 
contractions of the uterus to ensure it has evacuated completely 
antiabortion groups have promised to boycott any company that 
attempts to bring ru486 to the united states 
prochoice activists are trying to channel emotional energy away 
from the abortion controversy into contraceptive research 
it seems to me if we want to reduce the number of abortions 
we need to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies with 
better contraceptive options said rep olympia snowe rmaine 
schroeder and snowe are sponsoring a bill to establish three 
birth control research centers and two infertility research 
centers emphasizing research on new drugs and devices 
abortion foes oppose the bill which calls for 772 million to 
be spent over five years because it was written to permit 
federally funded research on abortion methods said douglas 
johnson a spokesman for the national right to life committee 
despite the controversy dr j joseph speidel president of the 
nonprofit population crisis committee is optimistic 
i dont think you can stop scientific progress he said i 
think well have some new contraceptives available but a lot 
of other countries will have them first

in a snowcovered courthouse about 125 
miles from the scene of the nations worst oil spill joseph 
hazelwood sits tugging nervously at his beard as testimony unwinds 
about a day that changed his life forever 
in the first week of his trial last week the former exxon 
valdez captain heard about every move he made and every drink he 
took during a relaxed presailing day ashore in the port town of 
valdez it was a day that culminated in the crash of his vessel 
spilling a gooey mass more than 10 million gallons of alaska crude 
oil into the clear waters of prince william sound 
the week ahead is expected to take hazelwood back aboard the 
987foot tanker with officers recalling events that preceded the 
march 24 grounding of the ship on jagged bligh reef 
the prosecutions star witness third mate gregory cousins is 
likely to shed some light on unexplained events including 
hazelwoods disappearance from the bridge for an hour before the 
accident 
was hazelwood drunk when the ship smashed into rocks or was the 
accident the fault of coast guard traffic monitors did the skipper 
leave an unqualified third mate cousins in control of the ship 
or had hazelwood left precise instructions which would have kept 
the tanker on a safe course 
those among other questions have been raised in the state 
court trial which is the only criminal proceeding to arise from the 
disaster 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is being tried on a felony 
charge of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges 
of reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating 
a vessel while intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on 
all counts is seven years three months in prison and 61000 in 
fines 
the skippers lawyers dick madson and michael chalos are 
trying to show that hazelwood was not reckless a requirement for 
being found guilty of criminal mischief they also seek to blame 
the coast guard for failing to notify hazelwood that his ship was 
heading for trouble 
madson maintains that coast guard monitors werent watching the 
radar screen when the accident occurred 
hazelwoods day ashore is at the center of the allegations 
against him witnesses outlined the path he took through valdez on 
that frosty day when light snow fell and easter was approaching 
three of hazelwoods shipmates said the captain asked them to 
lunch he stopped at his shipping agents office made some phone 
calls then headed to the pizza palace where he and his buddies 
lunched hazelwood drank iced tea 
after lunch marine pilot william e murphy drove hazelwood to a 
small shopping center where the captain may have entered a flower 
store to send flowers to his wife for easter or he may have gone 
directly to the pipeline club a bar across the street the point 
is in dispute 
perhaps the weeks most controversial witness was janice 
delozier wife of a coast guard investigator on the disaster who 
claimed she saw hazelwood drinking at the pipeline club hours 
before anyone else saw him she said the captain was ordering vodka 
at 145 pm his shipmates say he got to the bar about 4 pm the 
time element relates to how much liquor he might have consumed 
before sailing that evening 
mrs delozier acknowledged during crossexamination that she 
waited 10 days to come forward with her account because she thought 
people would consider her story fishy given her husbands link 
to the case and she feared questions about why she had spent her 
lunch hour in a bar she said she went there to drink coffee 
and how come she hadnt discussed her recollections with 
others in the bar that day asked attorney chalos 
theres no how come involved snapped the witness im 
not the town crier 
but she painted valdez as a small town where residents know 
everybody and discuss the local news 
no matter how many drinks hazelwood consumed one thing remained 
undisputed at weeks end the captain did not appear drunk murphy 
and two other officers said there was a telltale trace of alcohol 
on the captains breath but he didnt stagger or show any other 
signs of intoxication 
did he seem in command of this vessel asked chalos 
oh absolutely said murphy 
a bloodalcohol test administered to hazelwood 10 hours after 
the accident showed a level of061 under the state limit for 
driving but above the federal limit for operating a commercial 
vessel

here is the text of president 
fw de klerks statement saturday on nelson mandelas release 
in pursuance of my opening address to parliament i am now in a 
position to announce that mr nelson mandela will be released at 
the victor verster prison on sunday the 11th of february at about 
3 pm 
yesterday evening i met with mr mandela in cape town together 
with ministers gerrit viljoen and kobie coetsee during the 
meeting mr mandela was informed of the governments decision 
regarding his release 
we would all like mr mandelas release to take place in a 
dignified and orderly manner to attain this government officials 
are at the moment involved in discussions with parties concerned in 
order to afford them the opportunity to make suitable arrangements 
two issues were also raised during the discussions between me 
and mr mandela namely the state of emergency and the position of 
persons serving sentences for politically motivated crimes as well 
as those who have committed such crimes and are now outside the 
country 
i stressed the importance of creating conditions which would 
enable me to lift the state of emergency without jeopardizing the 
maintenance of law and order regarding the position of persons 
involved in politically motivated crimes i indicated that while 
this is a matter that should be dealt with in negotiations 
exploratory discussions could take place in the meantime 
i want to emphasize that there can no longer be any doubt about 
the governments sincerity to create a just dispensation based on 
negotiation i call upon mr mandela and all other interested 
parties to make their contribution towards a positive climate for 
negotiations 
the eyes of the world are presently focused on all south 
africans all of us now have an opportunity and the responsibility 
to prove that we are capable of a peaceful process in creating a 
new south africa 
ladies and gentlemen this announcement and tomorrow will bring 
us to the end of a long chapter what ive announced today was 
started by my predecessor a number of years ago since the moment 
that mr mandela met him at townhouse and since the moment that in 
that discussion mr mandela clearly stated his commitment also to 
peaceful solutions it has become a certainty that he would be 
released 
also in my two discussions with him late last year and last 
evening i came to the conclusion that he is committed to a 
peaceful solution and a peaceful process the government is 
committed to negotiation the government is committed to bring 
about through negotiation a new constitution which is fair and just 
to all the people of south africa i hope that now that this 
chapter is ended the world and more especially all the people of 
south africa will grasp the opportunity and play whatever 
supportive role can be played toward a peaceful conclusion of the 
process which has started

thousands of members of romanias 
hated securitate secret police have eluded authorities and may be 
plotting a counterrevolution to seize control timisoaras 
mayor warned 
alemorean pompiliu in an interview with the associated press on 
friday also said the official death toll of 100 that officials 
reported for timisoara in the december revolution was far too low 
he said doctors were intimidated into underreporting the number of 
deaths 
timisoara the cradle of the popular revolution that toppled 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu on dec 22 is officially 
described as romanias martyr city for its heavy toll in blood 
the city continues to suffer with shortages of basic foods 
especially eggs and milk long lines of shoppers loudly 
complaining of the shortages wait outside stores selling chicken 
imported from czechoslovakia 
the ousted communist system also left behind a series of 
social problems such as bad working habits and massive 
alcoholism pompiliu said 
we have accomplished only 20 percent of the revolution by 
changing the old system now the new system has to change the 
people pompiliu said 
in addition dangerous vestiges of the old system remain a 
threat he warned 
the situation in timisoara is still chaotic and fluid and we 
know that the securitate is active possibly planning a 
counterrevolution said pompiliu an architect who assumed the 
mayors post after the revolution 
only the heads of the securitate were arrested he said 
estimating that about 15000 secret police members remain at large 
in his city of 350000 timisoara is about 310 miles west of 
bucharest 
immediately after the victory of the revolution romanian and 
foreign media reports said as many as 4000 people had died in 
timisoara in clashes with the securitate troops who were fiercely 
loyal to ceausescu and battled the army when it joined the popular 
revolt against the dictator 
but officials recently said that according to reliable 
information only some 100 were killed and about 40 were reported 
missing they said however that the figure was not final 
both the official and the original figures are far from being 
correct the true death toll is somewhere in between pompiliu 
said 
it is a well known fact that the experts who estimated the 
official death toll and family members of the dead have received 
telephone threats apparently from stillactive securitate members 
in order to list the victims as if they had died of natural 
causes he said 
dusan nicolicin the secretary of the timisoara city council 
estimated that 1000 people died in the december fighting 
he added that dr leonard drexler the chief medical expert 
whose team released the official death toll figure in timisoara 
was under strong pressure from the securitate 
nicolicins statement was backed by romania libera and other 
newspapers which claimed that the director of the municipal 
hospital was a close relative of timisoaras former secret police 
chief drexler was not available for comment

katie tucker was on top of her world as 
1990 began serving as the states chief tax collector after 23 
years in state government last week she resigned in disgrace and 
faces felony charges 
talk of ms tuckers downfall has dominated the state capital 
since midjanuary when reports surfaced that she had personally 
ordered a 1988 tax investigation as a vendetta 
on tuesday ms tucker 46 resigned her 85292ayear job as 
director of the department of revenue minutes before republican 
gov bob martinez and the independently elected sixmember state 
cabinet were poised to fire her 
after an investigation by the florida department of law 
enforcement a state investigative agency she was arrested 
wednesday on felony charges of altering documents allegedly in a 
misguided attempt to prove the 1988 tax probe was part of a larger 
investigation to root out tax evaders 
her disgrace comes at an opportune time for the beleaguered 
martinez who is fighting for his political life while polls for 
this falls governors race showing democrats could beat him and 
even republican voters dont like him 
were not beating our chests on this thing but certainly the 
governor handled it appropriately and protected the taxpayers 
said brian ballard martinezs director of operations he led on 
it 
martinez who backed ms tucker in the 43 cabinet vote that got 
her the top tax job in 1988 led the fight to oust her 
all i can say is i must have stepped on some mighty big 
toes ms tucker said soon after resigning it must have been 
somebody with the ability to cause problems every time i tried 
to do anything 
ms tuckers troubles began when the fdle following martinezs 
orders investigated a report that she had personally ordered her 
department to look into the books of tallahassee businesses owned 
by donald g resha who lost a 1985 race for the presidency of the 
state aflcio to ms tuckers husband 
the fdle found no crime but martinez and the cabinet voted jan 
23 to suspend ms tucker for two weeks and allow her time to prove 
the resha case was not a vendetta 
after what aides said was a rambling hourlong interview between 
ms tucker and martinez the governor called for a second fdle 
investigation into ms tuckers claims she did not single out 
resha that probe found nothing to back up her story and suggested 
she had lied to martinez 
her troubles could have been avoided if she had admitted some 
overzealousness or perhaps even a few mistakes ballard said 
instead he said there were contradictory explanations of the 
storyline then there were denials new stories new denials i 
dont think well ever know exactly what happened 
things started getting mysterious soon after martinez called for 
her resignation jan 29 
the fdle said ms tucker made two afterhours visits to her 
office to type up backdated documents exonerating her showing one 
to a revenue department employee after telling him someone had left 
it anonymously on her porch 
the alleged falsifications turned up when her deputy revenue 
director sam alexander fearing his name was being used in 
forgery showed authorities scrap of paper with his initials on it 
and the center snipped out 
locks on the department doors were changed to keep ms tucker 
out and her typewriter and files were seized the tape cartridge 
of the typewriter showed a document prepared jan 31 was backdated 
to dec 21 1988 according to an fdle affidavit 
that led to the charges against ms tucker who turned herself 
in one day after her resignation she pleaded innocent to the 
charges and was released on her own recognizance 
state attorney willie meggs said ms tucker faces up to five 
years in prison and 5000 in fines but he doubts she would ever 
do any time its a little premature to say that but i think i 
can safely say no meggs said 
ms tucker also said she was resigning because she has been 
diagnosed with breast cancer and expects to learn a longterm 
prognosis in seven to 22 months it is not worth even a moment 
more of wasted energy on fights that only hurt me and certainly 
dont deserve my life she said in her resignation

residents hit by hurricane hugo needing 
everything from ice and water to food and a place to sleep didnt 
have to fight city hall for help 
they turned at the rate of some 150 people a day to the citys 
ombudsman a softspoken energetic woman who has been fielding 
residents gripes for 8 years 
barbara vaughn and her staff fielded thousands of calls from 
residents who weathered the worst hurricane to hit the antebellum 
seaport in more than two centuries hugo smashed ashore at 
charleston on sept 21 leaving 29 dead and 59 billion in damage 
as it swept across south carolina 
those who did not fare as badly simply wanted reassurance in the 
days after the storm later some needed a place to vent their 
frustrations 
somehow we did become a focus for the frustration it didnt 
do any good to yell at the roofer because that didnt make him work 
any faster ms vaughn said in an interview last week 
her office helps residents who have problems with city services 
or puts them in touch with those who can help if they city cant 
ms vaughn 47 who has a college degree in psycholgy said she got 
into her present job after working with her neighborhood community 
association 
in the first few days after the storm ms vaughn and her staff 
of two worked 18hour days fielding about 150 calls daily they 
found themselves counselors as much as anything else 
people werent angry or hostile they were frightened and 
wanted help she said 
later there were complaints about the debris cleanup from 
frustrated residents who wanted the garbage picked up more quickly 
other irate citizens called to complain that crews knocked over 
their mailboxes while removing debris 
why so much fuss about a mailbox ms vaughn has a theory 
after weathering the storm suffering property damage and going 
without power for days that was the proverbial last straw she 
said the mailbox was not a life and death issue but it gave 
people a reason to vent their anger 
many residents called with problems beyond the citys control 
but the staff would listen and often by the time they hung up 
callers seemed satisfied simply to have had someone listen 
nearly five months later the office still fields calls from 
those with stormrelated problems but the calls are dwindling 
on the federal level too calls for help are dwindling 
disaster assistance applications filed with the federal emergency 
management agency have steadily decreased but there are no 
immediate plans to pull out of south carolina an agency spokesman 
said friday 
we will be here as long as it takes frank mosco said 
one day last week fema received fewer than 100 applications 
the least since the storm there is light at the end of the 
tunnel mosco said 
fema has distributed nearly 95 million to 60000 eligible south 
carolina hugo victims 
at times ms vaughn felt she was not doing enough 
i understood we were dealing with peoples frustration she 
said but nothing would have pleased me more than to drop 
everything and go out and help i wished i had a dump truck or a 
chainsaw 
it was hard to say to someone this is the greatest disaster to 
hit charleston in over 200 years and that putting the pieces back 
in order is not an overnight thing

in an age of worry about the greenhouse 
effect ozone depletion and air pollution the thought of trying to 
solve the earths environmental problems may be enough to give many 
people a headache 
but what if we succeed what will the world be like sometime in 
the next century 
the worldwatch institute a washingtonbased environmental think 
tank sketches considers such questions in its annual look at the 
earth and its environmental problems 
the institute selected the year 2030 as the point at which 
mankind will succeed in building a sustainable society one in 
which basic human needs are met without jeopardizing future 
generations by putting the environment at risk 
thats a scant 40 years from today soon enough that hundreds of 
millions of people living today will if it comes to pass still 
be able to see it its closer than world war ii lester brown 
president of worldwatch and the studys director said in an 
interview last week 
while there is certainly no agreement within the scientific or 
environmental communities on whether such a world realistically can 
emerge in such a short period of time the worldwatch researchers 
provide a peek into at least one scenario that might develop if 
mankind comes to grips with todays environmental challenges 
on a self sustainable earth in the year 2030 worldwatch 
says our society may look like this 
fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas no longer will 
be relied upon as the primary source of energy instead energy 
needs will come primarily from solar and wind power farmers will 
harvest energy crops in marginal lands to run motor vehicles 
solar thermal plants will stretch across vast deserts and 
prairie lands some ranchers may earn more money from selling 
electricity than cattle as cities such as denver and kansas city 
mo rely on the wind for their electric needs 
the automobile no longer will be king replaced by mass 
transit and in many cases the bicycle with bike trails 
crisscrossing communities the cars that survive will get 100 or 
more miles to the gallon of fuel 
people will be living closer to their jobs and much 
socializing and shopping will be done by bike rather than 
automobile the worldwatch researchers say mass transit will 
welcome bikeandride customers 
citizens will be staying home more relying on computerized 
delivery services for their shopping and working in satellite 
offices at home freeing todays crowded highways 
conserving energy will be a hallmark of the self 
sustainable world of 2030 since total global carbon emissions 
which come from burning fossil fuels and are blamed for global 
warming would be reduced markedly 
homes will be so weather tight that it will not pay to install 
a furnace instead homeowners will rely on small electric heaters 
and lights and appliances will be so efficient residents may see 
almost the complete elimination of utility bills 
todays largely throwawaysociety will be replaced by a 
recycling ethic that will touch everything from milk bottles to 
automobiles 
the steel industry will rely on old automobiles appliances and 
other equipment for raw materials 
bottles containing everything from beer to milk will be 
interchangeable and returnable perhaps routed through a central 
computerized inventory and the fancy often excessive packaging 
that lines todays supermarkets will be prohibited by government 
regulators to cut down on waste 
shoppers will return to using canvas bags to carry home their 
purchases ridding supermarkets of todays reusable paper or 
plastic bags 
the worldwatch researchers acknowledged these changes will 
require a new set of values in the self sustainable world of 
2030 
it will become unfashionable to own fancy new cars and 
clothes they say adding this shift away from materialism 
will be among the hardest to make

lattie mcgee was only 4 but he knew as much 
about torture as any concentration camp inmate or prisoner of war 
his prison was a dark closet in his familys south side apartment 
where he often was hung upside down bound and gagged for hours 
lattie liked to play with his toy cars dance silly with his 
brother watch cartoons and romp in the mud outside when the 
weather was warm 
but latties joyous childhood vanished the summer of 1987 a 
summer of torture testimony about the agonies he endured shocked 
prosecutors defense attorneys and even the judge 
latties mother and her livein boyfriend who said he beat 
lattie and his brother because he thought they were homosexual are 
to be sentenced thursday by cook county criminal court judge 
michael b getty 
getty called latties death the most heinous brutally 
sadistic torture and murder that i have ever heard in my 6 
years as a judge my over 10 years as a prosecutor or indeed my 51 
years on this earth 
lattie was starved burned with a hot iron stuck with pins and 
needles singed with cigarettes beaten with a tree branch hair 
brush belt and hands scalded with steaming water and tied up 
with a clothesline rope and tights for 2 months that summer 
court testimony showed 
a severe blow to his head in august was the eventual cause of 
death but his emaciated body scarred from head to foot was so 
infected from untreated wounds that he likely would have died a 
short time later a pathologist from the county medical examiners 
office testified 
criminal convictions in abuse cases are more an exception than 
the rule unless the child dies said dr demetra soter coordinator 
of the pediatric trauma unit at cook county hospital 
abuse cases often are not prosecuted or even investigated 
until the victim is killed because people in high levels of 
position cant believe that people torture children she said 
hopefully with people seeing stuff like this theyll start to 
believe that it really happens 
latties was one of 40278 reported cases of child abuse or 
neglect in cook county in 1987 and one of 38 reported deaths said 
david schneidman a spokesman for the state department of children 
and family services statewide there were 91723 cases and 54 
deaths he said 
the numbers are worse for 1988 the most recent period for which 
statistics are available in cook county 54 of the 42564 reported 
abuse or neglect cases ended in death schneidman said statewide 
91723 cases of abuse or neglect and 98 deaths were reported 
the night before lattie died his mothers boyfriend johnny 
campbell taped potato peels over the boys eyes and hung him in 
the closet court records show 
when lattie was taken down the next day aug 14 1987 and 
asked for water campbell told him to act like a man and get it 
himself lattie tried but sapped of strength failed campbell 
punched him in the head the records show 
when lattie didnt move his mother called an ambulance he was 
pronounced dead on arrival at south shore hospital lattie weighed 
26 pounds the size of a normal 1yearold 
dr shaku teas the pathologist who did the autopsy was asked 
by a prosecutor if she found anything remarkable about his injuries 
everything was remarkable she said describing his injuries 
in gruesome detail as photographs of his body were shown in court 
his pelvis had been broken several days before he died and two 
of his ribs had been snapped several weeks earlier ms teas 
testified 
campbell 40 pleaded guilty dec 6 to murdering lattie and 
beating the boys brother cornelius abraham now 8 his attorney 
says campbell is psychotic 
on jan 11 getty convicted the childrens 28yearold mother 
alicia abraham on the same charges she acknowledged never 
reporting the torture of her children but said she did not abuse 
them herself 
prosecutors have urged getty to order the pair executed for what 
assistant states attorney james bigoness called a truly 
abominable crime 
its probably one of the ugliest cases you will ever see 
said clyde lemons jr ms abrahams attorney who argued that she 
was guilty of bad judgment but was not a murderer 
lavonne steger 18 whose parents cared for ms abraham as a 
child when her own parents died still cries when talking about 
lattie she considers ms abraham her sister and often played with 
the children when they were brought over for a visit 
cornelius liked to play basketball and read lattie was a quiet 
boy with shining dark eyes and a sweet smile 
he liked to go outside and play in the mud miss steger said 
in a telephone interview her voice at times choking with emotion 
other days he just liked to watch cartoons and play with his 
cars he was happy 
lattie was the second child born to ms abraham a small stocky 
woman she dropped out of south shore high school when she became 
pregnant with cornelius and had lattie two years later she never 
married the boys father lattie mcgee sr an attendant at the 
countys home for juvenile delinquents 
the couple were together five years until splitting up in 1984 
and she had another son and a daughter with another man the 
younger children live with their paternal grandmother under legal 
guardianship of the department of children and family services 
mcgee who now has cornelius could not be reached to talk about 
the case calls to his home went unanswered or were disconnected 
when a reporter called 
unemployed and on public aid ms abraham was accused of neglect 
in 1985 after state authorities found her living in a filthy 
apartment with no furniture her sons slept on the floor and were 
inadequately fed court records show 
ms abraham underwent counseling after months of supervision 
state investigators determined the situation had improved 
but then she met johnny campbell a short fineboned man with 
powerfully muscled arms who said he was a vietnam veteran and 
exsteel worker whod been fired for alcohol and drug abuse 
in early 1987 campbell moved into the small apartment ms 
abraham shared with her four children on the top floor of a tidy 
sixstory brick apartment building in the south shore district a 
black mostly middleclass neighborhood along chicagos southern 
lakefront 
latties father who kept in touch with his boys and has 
attended court proceedings last saw them in early june 1987 when 
cornelius graduated from kindergarten bigoness said both children 
appeared healthy 
things quickly changed

given two minutes to gather all the compact discs 
she could lisa lyles knew preparation physical mental and 
emotional would be key 
so the operalover who won the shopping spree through a bank 
promotion trained for the task she swam laps for endurance 
practiced yoga for control figured out how to make her hands 
sticky drew maps of the terrain and developed memorynudging 
devices 
i knew this was a onceinalifetime opportunity i had to go 
for it and meet the challenge lyles said saturday 
in the end she raced through the tower records building friday 
scooping up 60 compact discs chiefly classical ones and ran up a 
bill of 2054 during her twominute allotment five times what 
the promotors figured each contestant would rake in 
the 34yearold melrose resident was one of three people whose 
names were drawn a week ago for a twominute shopping dash 
the folks at baybank had estimated shelling out about 400 per 
contestant to promote a new branch little did they realize that 
lavish boxed sets of some classical music collections go for 250 
per 
i didnt do it intentionally but i was told outright there 
were no restrictions lyles said i knew i could not afford to 
purchase 180 boxed sets so i said to myself im going to hit 
these 
lyles a fundraiser for the boston symphony orchestra spotted 
which aisles had the best things estimated the trips she would 
need and made up singsong ditties to jog her memory about what she 
wanted 
she also discovered that a tacky cloth she and her husband used 
to strip furniture gave her sticky fingers when her time came at 
tower records she was ready 
when i see something well dont stand in my way lyles 
said yoga helps you get a hold of yourself but in the end its 
that animal drive and knowing what you want 
this is her normal way of doing things only very condensed 
said her husband james 
jaymes leavitt a northeastern university freshman from paxton 
eclipsed lyles haul by gathering up 86 compact discs but his 
taste was less expensive at a grand total of 1300 worth of 
merchandise 
another northeastern freshman edward monette of west hampton 
beach ny was the third entrant staggering out the door with 59 
compact discs worth 900 and weighing about 30 pounds 
over the past week leavitt and monette were looking over the 
stores second floor layout of 15 hard rock cds while lyles was on 
the third floor checking out 250 boxed sets of bachs organ works 
and wagners ring cycle

the main opposition coalition in the 
feb 25 election has been hampered by fear low funding personal 
rivalry ideological divisions and a presidential candidate with a 
fractured knee 
but it is drawing ever increasing crowds to its rallies and its 
true strength may be even larger on election day 
the ruling sandinista national liberation fronts rallies are 
larger and better organized than those of the united national 
opposition but they are also salted with government employees who 
fear they would risk their jobs if they dont attend 
youll never see me at an uno rally said a 37yearold 
managua professional who spoke on condition of anonymity theres 
still a chance of violence and who wants to get beaten up but im 
voting for uno thats for sure 
the uno candidate violeta barrios de chamorro publisher of the 
opposition newspaper la prensa suffered a fractured knee on new 
years eve and has been campaigning from a wheelchair in the back 
of a pickup truck under a sun tent looking like a saint at a 
procession as one of her aides put it 
attendance at uno rallies has shot from several hundred into the 
thousands in the last three weeks an estimated 7000 in the town 
of jinotepe 6000 in granada 10000 in esteli 7000 in rivas 
i know some people will come by tomorrow to nag you about 
having come said mrs chamorro in esteli referring to the 
sandinistas but just remember your vote is secret 
president daniel ortega seeking another sixyear term has shed 
his sober image and campaigned vigorously in tshirts and bomber 
jackets the sandinistas have also enlisted alf the us tv 
situation comedy character who is a favorite of nicaraguan children 
alf a fuzzy space alien with a long snout is pictured on wall 
murals as telling his planet earth host willy that he will vote 
sandinista 
an inveterate cathater alf also is pictured squeezing the neck 
of a feline representing uno sandinista spokesmen said they did 
not know if alfs creators had given their permission for the alien 
endorsement 
in any case the sandinistas seem to be nervous 
and when you return to your neighborhoods to your villages 
talk to your neighbor to your friend to your relative to anyone 
who still might be confused urged ortega at a rally in somoto 
violence subsided after an uno rally in masatepe last december 
turned into a bloodly riot that left one dead and about 20 injured 
police now patrol every rally and international election observers 
have praised the job theyre doing to keep order 
confusion is what seemed to reign at an uno rally feb 4 in the 
small town of posoltega 
a brief fistfight erupted between antonio lacayo campaign 
manager and mrs chamorros soninlaw and jaime bonilla of the 
independent liberal party which provided mrs chamorros running 
mate virgilio godoy 
nobody at uno wanted to discuss the fight in which lacayo and 
bonilla exchanged punches on stage before an amused crowd 
the brawl pointed to deep divisions within uno a coalition of 
14 parties with a broad range of ideologies from communist to 
conservative whose only common denominator is their opposition to 
the sandinistas 
personal and ideological rifts have been reported pitting godoy 
against lacayo mrs chamorros son pedro joaquin against mrs 
chamorros close adviser former contra directorate member alfredo 
cesar and a host of other minor rivalries 
mrs chamorros choice of campaign manager has been called an 
example of nepotism lacayo a businessman has no previous 
political experience 
the opposition also complains of lack of money and the un 
observer mission has noted the sandinistas continued use of 
government property use of public property is allowed but a party 
has to pay for it 
last week sovietmade military helicopters flew over the town of 
juigalpa showering sandinista flyers and touting an ortega rally 
the sandinistas regularly try to cut attendance at uno rallies 
by scheduling baseball games or free parties at the same time 
pressure tactics apparently have not muzzled some as people 
were boarding about 100 trucks and buses to return to their towns 
and villages following a sandinista rally in jinotepe one man 
climbing into a large truck yelled a loud and defiant viva la 
uno 
there are no reliable polls to help observers call the race and 
crowdcounting sometimes is the only game in town 
uno and sandinista crowds were about equal at rallies in 
granada nicaraguas secondlargest city but there was 
considerably more visible enthusiasm at the uno rally however in 
jinotepe the uno rally was only half the size of the sandinista 
rally 
my impression so far is that a lot of people are playing it 
safe but that on the day of the voting theyll quietly put their 
cross on uno said a senior west european diplomat 
mrs chamorro scored a point with an endorsement thursday from 
yatama a coalition of atlantic coast indians the indians may 
represent as many as 80000 votes in the 17 millionstrong 
electorate 
meanwhile the sandinistas are wooing as many groups as possible 
and trying to take the wind out of mrs chamorros sails on 
friday the government released 39 former members of dictator 
anastasio somozas national guard and almost 1000 captured contra 
guerrillas 
mrs chamorros promise to open the jails once she was 
elected had been one of her top applause lines 
taking advantage of a strong roman catholic cult of the virgin 
mary mrs chamorro usually wears white to signify purity 
that has been the despair of news photographers who frequently 
swirl around searching for a way to avoid photographing the 
whiteclad candidate against the brilliant tropical sunshine

nasas galileo spacecraft developed 
camera trouble today after zooming around cloudcovered venus in a 
celestial billiard shot that speeded the robot explorer toward 
its 1995 encounter with jupiter 
although the glitch threatened to prevent galileo from snapping 
five dozen more pictures of venus tonight and next week project 
scientist torrence johnson of nasas jet propulsion laboratory said 
it should cause no permanent problems for the mission 
mission director neal ausman said the tv camera shutter after 
taking 16 planned pictures of venus early today clicked open and 
closed 452 times twice per minute apparently because of faulty 
commands from the probes main computer 
ausman speaking at a news conference said the unwanted 
computer commands then stopped for reasons not immediately 
understood and a nasa was working to fix the problem 
the extra exposures werent recorded the malfunction wont harm 
the 16 pictures that were taken the camera was undamaged and 
engineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired project 
manager dick spehalski said 
the 28ton spacecraft made its closest approach to venus at 
959 pm pst friday it was supposed to pass 10028 miles above 
the furnacelike surface of the second planet from the sun but 
actually came three or four miles closer said mission science and 
design manager bill oneil 
we have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to venus 
a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach jupiter he said 
as a result scientists wont be very disappointed if the 
malfunction prevents galileo from snapping an additional five dozen 
planned pictures of venus which has been photographed by numerous 
other spacecraft johnson said 
the 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloud 
patterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presence 
of volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds 
the spacecrafts ultraviolet visible and infrared light sensors 
studied the makeup of venus carbon dioxide atmosphere mapped 
cloudtop temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot lower 
atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead johnson said 
the pictures and data were stored on galileos tape recorder 
and wont be sent back to earth until october when the spacecraft 
is close enough to transmit the material with its lowgain antenna 
that antenna now can be used only for communications to keep 
galileo operating 
galileos main umbrellashaped antenna must remain furled to 
protect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past earth 
on dec 8 
the 135 billion mission also will let galileo examine earth 
its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates 
into an orbiter and a small probe in july 1995 in december 1995 
they arrive at jupiter the solar systems largest planet after a 
24billionmile trip including 182 million miles to reach venus 
galileo was deployed from space shuttle atlantis last oct 18 
acidladen clouds extend 40 miles above venus surface trapping 
heat in a runaway greenhouse effect that raises surface 
temperatures to 900 degrees fahrenheit atmospheric pressure is 90 
times that on earth 
ausman said the photos and measurements of venus were secondary 
to the main purpose of the flyby using the planet as a gravity 
slingshot to expand the spacecrafts orbit and boost its speed to 
88740 mph from 83750 mph 
we have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard 
shot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to jupiter 
johnson said 
galileo will use the earth as a gravity slingshot next december 
and again dec 8 1992 so it will be properly aimed toward 
jupiter ausman said 
nasas magellan spacecraft launched from atlantis last may 4 
will go into orbit around venus in august it will use radar map at 
least 70 percent of venus surface during a 550 million mission 
when the galileo probe and orbiter reach jupiter the probe will 
parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense 
heat and pressure vaporizes it the orbiter will photograph and 
study jupiter and its major moons until late 1997 circling the 
planet instead of flying past it like the pioneer and voyager 
spacecraft 
galileos roundabout route to jupiter is an indirect result of 
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger and killed 
seven crew members after the tragedy the national aeronautics and 
space administration decided against using powerful volatile 
liquidfueled centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were 
deployed from shuttles 
instead galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it was 
released from atlantis cargo bay that made it necessary to use 
the gravity of venus and earth to help speed and aim galileo toward 
jupiter a centaur would have propelled galileo to venus in only 
two years 
environmentalists failed in court to block galileos mission 
they feared a challengerlike explosion could contaminate florida 
with plutonium in galileos nuclear batteries which generate 
electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium 
nasa said the risk was minimal

this could be the year that the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law goes from boon to boomerang as far as 
liberal democrats eager to cut the defense budget are concerned 
since its inception in 1985 the law has served as a guillotine 
over the heads of congress and the white house if the two sides 
prove unable to shrink the federal deficit to a series of declining 
annual levels the law automatically triggers spending cuts 
divided 5050 between defense and domestic programs 
democrats signed onto the law because they knew thenpresident 
reagan would be reluctant to risk the heavy slashes grammrudman 
would impose on his cherished defense buildup 
but now some democrats who want dramatic reductions in the 
pentagons coffers in the wake of political changes in eastern 
europe say the law now produces just the opposite effect 
liberals worry that if they push for defense slashes so deep 
that they exceed or even approach what the grammrudman ax would 
chop away president bush might just let grammrudman go to work 
that would mean deep cuts not just in defense but in many domestic 
programs dear to democrats hearts 
thats the dilemma were in says rep dale kildee dmich 
a member of the house budget committee and a longtime fighter for 
child nutrition education and other social programs the 
president holds the hammer on us this year 
this is having a practical effect on the debate over the 
socalled peace dividend the savings expected to flow from the 
brakes that are being applied to next years pentagons budget 
bushs proposed 123 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1991 
which starts oct 1 seeks 3033 billion for defense that is 7 
billion more than this years allowance but 32 billion less than 
the amount that would have been needed to let military spending 
keep pace with inflation 
democrats and many republicans want to cut deeper but the 
simple arithmetic of grammrudman dictates how much deeper they can 
go without risking trouble 
under current official projections lawmakers and bush will have 
to find 365 billion in savings to pare the 1991 deficit to the 
grammrudman target of 64 billion 
should there be a budget stalemate between congress and the 
white house those cuts would be imposed automatically about 183 
billion apiece on defense and domestic programs 
under the laws peculiar math cuts are made from the amount a 
program would be expected to grow to when inflation and other 
factors are considered that means that should the grammrudman 
cuts take effect defense spending would be pared to about 2882 
billion the number could change based on congressional action and 
unexpected economic performance 
thus 2882 billion flashes like an amber danger light for some 
democratic budget writers cut the defense budget to near that 
level they fear and bush can threaten to let grammrudman and its 
slashes in domestic initiatives take effect 
not everyone agrees with this scenario for one thing many 
democrats are talking about defense spending levels that would not 
go quite so low for another this is an election year which means 
lawmakers want to avoid a lengthy budget fight so they will have 
time to campaign 
congress will want to be out of town some time in early 
october says robert reischauer director of the congressional 
budget office congress nonpartisan budget analysts if the 
past is any indication they wont want to come back for a lame 
duck session theyre going to want to have their spending 
bills passed 
nonetheless the automatic grammrudman cuts kicked in last 
october when bush engaged congress in a lengthy and unsuccessful 
fight to win a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
in their final budget agreement lawmakers and the white house 
agreed to keep the reductions in effect for onethird of this year 
resulting in 15 percent cuts in defense spending and 14 percent 
reductions in most domestic programs the cuts are expected to 
produce 3 billion worth of savings this year

on a drizzling night in june chittavoravong 
saly waded silently into the mekong river stroking slowly so as 
not to splash he swam to freedom 
less than 11 years after escaping from his jailers in laos 
chittavoravong feels he is being persecuted again this time by 
the us budget ax which is threatening to eliminate his job at the 
voice of america 
to save 3 million the governmentrun radio network announced 
several weeks ago it would silence six of its 43 language services 
lao uzbek slovenian swahili greek and turkish chittavoravong 
after seven years at voa is among the most junior of the 11 lao 
staffers near the door 
however the publicity generated by the announcement led voas 
parent the us information agency to consider ways of possibly 
salvaging the broadcasts by asking congress to authorize a shifting 
of funds from other voa accounts 
usia directed us to solve the problem and find a way to keep 
broadcasting robert coonrod voas deputy director said 
saturday congressional approval of the funding still was 
uncertain he added 
chittavoravong loved listening to the voa back in vientiane the 
capital of the isolated southeast asian nation 
chittavoravong taught english at the laoamerican culture center 
and also at a teachers college he also taught laotian to diplomats 
at the australian british and us embassies 
soon after the communist pathet lao movement seized power in 
1975 a truck pulled up to the teachers college soldiers sought 
out chittavoravong handcuffed him and took him away 
the slightly built teacher was accused of being a spy for the 
cia no charges were ever brought against him and there was no 
trial 
for two and ahalf years chittavoravong shared a jail hall with 
about 250 inmates sleeping on a wooden floor with a blanket and 
mosquito net as cover 
chittavoravong was among a favored few whose families were 
allowed to bring them food once a month 
every night inmates sat crosslegged on the floor in groups of 
10 and conducted selfcriticism sessions in which they 
confessed their thoughts and misdeeds of the day typical 
confessions would consist of an inmate telling how he stole a 
banana from someones food package from home 
once every few weeks chittavoravong was required to write about 
his past sometimes at great length and sometimes in abbreviated 
form they were trying to confuse us and to find 
discrepancies he said in an interview 
occasionally chittavoravong heard gunshots but information 
about the shootings was hard to obtain i tried to be a good boy 
i didnt want to be punished he said 
in a suburb of vientiane his mother prayed to her ancestors 
spirits for her sons release she sacrificed pigs heads and 
pledged that if released her son would become a monk 
chittavoravongs incarceration ended as abruptly as it began 
one spring day in 1979 he was told he had been reeducated and 
was free to go but chittavoravong had by then decided to go much 
farther than his suburban home this system was not human he 
said i decided it was either death or freedom 
first however he had to fulfill his mothers vow so he shaved 
his head and entered a monastery 
at night lying under a blanket on his narrow cot 
chittavoravong listened to the outlawed broadcasts of the voice of 
america then as now it was the only western radio that could be 
heard in the landlocked country 
he planned his escape with the help of a relative who drove him 
to the banks of the mekong he was hidden by another relative until 
it was deemed safe for him to attempt the swim to thailand he took 
with him several personal documents some thai money a pair of 
pants and a shirt all of which he kept dry in an inner tube 
but his ordeal was not over yet upon reaching thailand 
chittavoravong was thrown into a small jail he had enough money to 
eventually bribe his way out and reach a un refugee camp from 
there he obtained a visa to come here 
now with four children and a new mortgage the 50yearold 
broadcaster feels his world is coming apart again i dont know 
what i can do its so sad i love this job he said 
voa has promised to help the laidoff employees find new jobs 
but lao service chief linthong noinala is doubtful that more than 
one or two can find jobs comparable to their current positions 
linthong a 22year voa veteran whose wife died last month is 
disconsolate we will survive we will do what we have to even if 
its cooking or cleaning but i dont understand why they are doing 
this to us

defense secretary dick cheney is en route to 
asia for talks in south korea the philippines and japan on such 
sensitive issues as possible us troop cuts and the future of 
american bases in the pacific

and hong kong is the first such trip for cheney as secretary of 
defense 
cheneys goal is to consult with his counterparts before an 
april 1 report to congress on reorganizing us forces in east 
asia it is required under legislation sponsored by sens sam nunn 
dga and john warner rva 
cheney has signed a longrange paper offering guidance to the 
military that assumes asian allies must take up more of the burden 
of their defense it also assumes a smaller us military presence 
in the pacific where the future of bases such as clark and subic 
in the philippines has come into question 
but the document also stresses that the united states will 
remain committed to the forward deployment of its forces in the 
region 
in the philippines president corazon aquino has said 
negotiations on the future of the bases leased under an agreement 
set to expire in 1991 might begin in march or april 
in a recent interview with wire service reporters cheney said 
he had a full range of items to discuss with the civilian and 
military leaders on his trip including the question of burden 
sharing 
the term refers to efforts to seek funding from the allied 
nations that host us forces and benefit from their defense such 
as japan south korea and western europe 
during a time of tight budgets at home the defense secretary 
has come under severe questioning in congress about the 
administrations 2921 billion request for pentagon spending 
during the next fiscal year 
and even though cheney announced in connection with his budget 
that some 2000 us personnel will be withdrawn from three us 
air force bases in south korea in an attempt to cut costs some 
lawmakers are demanding more severe drawdowns in us forces 
overseas 
the issue is a delicate one for south korea a nation that hosts 
43000 us troops under a mutual defense pact us forces fought 
on the south korean side after the communist north invaded to start 
the 195053 korean war 
cheney said that alan holmes a state department 
ambassadoratlarge who deals with burden sharing will be with us 
for part of the trip and that he intends to talk with our 
allies about the subject 
the secretary will visit south korea on feb 1417 hong kong 
feb 1718 the philippines on feb 1820 and japan from feb 2024 
at each stop except hong kong cheney is to meet with the us 
forces stationed there and he plans to review host nation forces 
in korea the philippines and japan 
a senior defense department official briefing reporters on the 
trip on condition he not be identified by name said there will be 
no announcements of troop cuts during cheneys visits 
and while cheney intends to discuss the future of the strategic 
us bases in the philippines he does not intend to enter into any 
kind of negotiations about them the official said 
this is not the first stage of negotiations secretary cheney 
is not taking any message about the upcoming talks the official 
said 
before traveling to south korea cheney planned a threenight 
stop in hawaii for talks with adm huntington hardisty the top 
military man in the pacific and visits with us troops at several

here is a text of the question 
and answer session of president fw de klerks news conference on 
saturday announcing that black nationalist leader nelson mandela 
would be freed the text was provided to the associated press by 
the presidents office 
question do you believe this now fulfills all the preconditions 
for the usa and other countries to lift sanctions against south 
africa 
de klerk we are not working against checklists we are doing 
what we sincerely believe to be in the best interests of south 
africa obviously there are still some of the preconditions which 
have been set by various sources which have not literally been met 
but the most important stumbling blocks in the way of negotiation 
in the way of positive developments to create a climate for 
negotiation have now been addressed to my mind 
question mr president will the state lend security personnel 
and apparatus to ensure mr mandelas safety and secondly do you 
expect that he will depart tomorrow for his home in soweto 
de klerk the question of security and the actual process of 
release is that which is being discussed now with interested 
parties by officials of the government the state will secure the 
position of mr mandela while he is in custody of the state as 
regards the rest of your question when mr mandela is released he 
becomes a free man and he does not owe it to me to inform us of his 
program i have not asked him about it either 
question mr president you said that mr mandela has committed 
himself to a peaceful solution in south africa does that mean that 
he now officially rejects violence 
de klerk i do not intend to speak on behalf of mr mandela this 
afternoon he will be able to do so tomorrow 
question a number of people who have met with mr mandela since 
your original meeting have spoken about it very positively and 
about the chemistry that exists between you and him i wonder if 
you can tell us about your impressions of him and give us some kind 
of idea of the exchanges that you have had 
de klerk the discussions really took place in a very civil 
atmosphere he is a friendly man i would like to think that i am 
also a friendly man yes the discussions really took place in good 
spirit he is an elderly dignified man and he is an interesting 
man 
question mr president the minister of constitutional 
development said that the state of emergency could be lifted within 
weeks is that a fair assessment on your part now after meeting 
with mr mandela 
de klerk as it is clearly stated in my statement the final 
test is the situation on the ground and everything will depend 
upon the question whether we get an increase in unrest or whether 
we get a decrease in unrest 
question mr president mr mandela has made clear over the 
past few weeks that he was uncomfortable being released in a 
situation where the state of emergency was still in force and not 
all political prisoners had been freed what was his reaction to 
you informing him of his release into those conditions 
de klerk once again i really do not want to speak on his 
behalf i can only give impressions and i went to great lengths to 
explain why the situation is as it is with regard to the state of 
emergency and that partiular question you must ask him tomorrow 
question mr de klerk how are you going to release mr 
mandela are you going to release him from the prison straight into 
freedom or are you going to take him away 
de klerk that is part of the process that is being discussed by 
officials now i wont be present and i do not intend to interfere 
in the detail 
question you spoke of an increase or decrease in violence what 
judgement or basis are you going to use for determining whether you 
feel there has indeed been the right climate established for doing 
away with the regulations 
de klerk well obviously any government has sources of 
information available to it it is official sources reports from 
its security forces its police wherever they are factual reports 
which come in regularly which are all assimilated at one central 
point analyzed and studied we deal with such things in a very 
scientific manner and we know what is going on in every corner of 
the country 
question what i meant sir you know that you are going to be 
subjected to some considerable scrutiny is there some sort of norm 
that you have established that you can set out for us now as to 
what would constitute stability

de klerk stability is stability stability is a situation where 
people can feel safe where people who want to go to work can do 
so where people can live a normal life without intimidation 
without threat stability is a situation where you do not have 
arson in a country because of political debate and differences 
stability is a situation where you do not have deaths as a result 
of political strife that is the sort of stability we are striving 
for obviously in any country at all times you have crimes and 
we go to great lengths to draw the necessary distinctions between 
ordinary and politically related instability 
question mr president when you talk about a fair and just 
preliminary to negotiations will you go beyond the state of 
emergency and discuss as well the negotiation process the 
establishment of full citizenship rights for the black people of 
south africa 
de klerk thank you for that question we have just won an 
election stating that as our goal that is the mandate that my 
party asked of the electorate and that is the mandate that we 
received there is a misconception that we do not want to give full 
citizenship rights to all south africans also to black south 
africans as a matter of fact we have already received such a 
mandate from the white electorate in an election in 1989 
it is no longer a question whether all south africans must get 
full citizenship rights the question is how to structure it how 
also to accommodate the diversity in a nondiscriminatory manner 
of our total population the fact that we have minorities but 
nonetheless that clear commitment is the system must give full 
classa citizenships to all south africans irrespective of race or 
color 
de klerk once again i do not want to speak on his behalf 
question mr president while in custody mr mandela indicated 
that he would act as an intermediary or facilitator between the 
government and the anc do you expect to continue to deal with him 
now on that basis 
de klerk i follow an opendoor policy and should come forward 
and should he be prepared to play the role of facilitator to 
interest himself in promoting a climate for negotiation should he 
interest himself in promoting talks even talks about talks yes 
that open door is also open to him 
question president de klerk i was wondering whether the 
presence of the rev jackson here in south africa had anything to 
do with the release of mandela laughter 
de klerk as far as the release of mr mandela is concerned his 
presence is totally irrelevant 
question president can i ask you did mr mandela give you any 
assurance that he would call for peace in this country 
de klerk i did not ask him 
question president from your last reply when you said that he 
is prepared to act as a facilitator does that mean he has not 
given you his agreement to enter negotiation 
de klerk his willingness to act as a facilitator has been 
published widely and over a fairly long period now i did not 
discuss it with him as such again last night 
question mr de klerk could you possibly describe mr 
mandelas reaction when you told him he would be released tomorrrow 
de klerk i do not think that i would like to try to do that 
question returning to the question of the lifting of the state 
of emergency the stability required does this imply that you will 
wait until there is complete peace in the natal province and do 
you think that that realistically will happen within the few weeks 
time that some of your ministers have given as a time span for that 
lifting 
de klerk there is an element of uncertainty obviously with 
regard to everything which lies in the future none of us can 
exactly say what will happen tomorrow and the day after it is 
really our hope that with the steps which we have taken that it 
will make a contribution and that will bring us soon to the 
situation where it can be considered we review this situation 
almost on an ongoing basis almost on a daytoday basis and we 
are as anxious as anybody else to have the state of emergency 
lifted as soon as possible 
question you said that the lifting of the state of emergency 
would be a matter for negotiations with whom do you propose to 
negotiate mr mandela the anc who 
de klerk no i did not say that is matter for negotiation i 
said that the question of political prisoners is a matter for 
negotiation the state of emergency was imposed by the government 
because of a state of instability throughout our country it will 
be a government decision to lift it and the test will be whether 
the stability has been restored sufficiently so that we can do so 
question but you did say that you have discussed it with mr 
mandela didnt you 
de klerk yes obviously because it is a matter which is being 
raised from many quarters as also being a stumbling block and in 
that sense it was discussed 
question mr president may i ask you have you already or are 
you about to inform world leaders and if so whom 
de klerk i have informed our minister of foreign affairs a few 
hours ago and in all probability he has undertaken an exercise so 
that they will not just read it in the press it is general custom 
which we adhere to and that i am sure he has done i did not speak 
to anybody 
question are you sir concerned at all for the safety of 
nelson mandela and if so how 
de klerk yes in my opening address or rather in another 
statement i indicated that yes i think there is reason for 
concern about his safety there are all sorts of people who might 
threaten his life i think radicals from the very far left might be 
tempted to do so and i think there is also a risk that it might 
come from radicalists from the right many publicc figures are 
being threatened throughout the world almost in all countries and 
with him having such a high profile i think yes there is a real 
risk and one must take every precaution to ensure that noghing 
happens to him but when he leaves prison then he will be moving 
to his own circle of friends and in all probability as in the 
case of mr sisulu and the other prisoners which we released there 
was no request to the state to give any assistance with regard to 
their security 
question mr president i wonder if i may ask you to define the 
mandate how do you define full constitutional rights is that one 
man one vote 
de klerk can we save that for the press conference of next 
week that is the type of thing i would likee to address then 
thank you very much

announced saturday 
shuttle managers said after a twoday flight readiness review 
that the launch would occur between 12 am and 4 am the fourth 
afterdark liftoff in 34 shuttle missions 
feb 22 has been the target date for some time and the review 
turned up nothing to change that there are no significant 
problems standing in the way of launch said a nasa statement 
replacement of a main engine turbopump had threatened a oneday 
delay but that work was completed saturday without affecting the 
schedule 
because atlantis payload is classified the pentagon and nasa 
will not announce the precise launch time until nine minutes before

ships sitting offshore to track the spaceship

less than a year after helping his first 
wife take her own life so she would not die a slow painful death 
from cancer derek humphry married again 
with his new wife ann he founded the hemlock society an 
organization that became a leader in the righttodie movement 
but after ann w humphry was diagnosed with breast cancer last 
year the couple became embroiled in a bitter divorce that has left 
mrs humphry accusing her estranged husband of abandoning the 
societys most basic principles as well as abusing his leadership 
its a tragic case of a lot of dirty linen being washed in 
public said william batt a director of the national 
organization and president of the societys upstate new york 
chapter 
last month the societys board of directors restructured the 
organization it voted both humphrys off the board appointed derek 
humphry executive director and placed ann humphry on sick leave 
the board expressed full confidence in derek humphry board 
member faye girsh of san diego said its his vision 
the moves were long overdue board members said it was really 
a momandpop organization board member john westover of tucson 
ariz said last week it had really outgrown the situation 
in fact the board would like someone else to take over 
administrative duties so that derek humphry can devote himself to 
developing policy and spreading the societys message westover said 
the intertwined story of derek and ann humphry and the hemlock 
society began when they were married 13 years ago in england he 
was a british journalist she was an american academic 
in 1978 they moved to los angeles where they founded the 
hemlock society in 1980 to crusade for the right to choose death 
as humphrys first wife jean had done 
the humphrys moved hemlock in 1988 to eugene ore where the 
national organization employs 13 people and counts 53 chapters 
across the united states 
ann humphry bought a 50acre farm in monroe 20 miles north of 
eugene where the couple lived until last october three weeks 
after she was diagnosed with breast cancer derek humphry went on a 
speaking tour in new mexico and never came home again 
she wouldnt let me have anything to do with her cancer 
said humphry 59 she wouldnt let me come to the hospital she 
wouldnt tell me the details she said you stay out of it 
he said his wife finally changed her mind but began to taunt 
him about his previous wife 
would i do the same for her did i love her as much as my 
first wife things were said that i could not bear the 
marriage just broke to pieces in my eyes and i left her 
it was a bad marriage for four or five years he said the 
cancer just cracked it open the cancer just finished it off 
ann humphry acknowledged that the couple had been seeing 
marriage counselors 
she said she had been growing more distant from both her husband 
and the hemlock society in recent years and the cancer was the 
final straw 
i think it was a terrible blow to him she said he said 
i cannot live with this misery any longer i dont choose to live 
through what i lived through once he added that if i were dying 
he would make certain that i would be looked after 
derek humphry said the point was she was not dying that the 
lump had been removed from her breast in time and her physician 
gave her a 75 percent chance of recovery 
in addition ann humphry said she believed her husband has hurt 
the righttodie movement 
the hemlock society has in its thesis that anyone with a 
lifethreatening illness should be provided a nurturing and 
supportive environment she said it is ironic that its leader 
left his wife three weeks after she was diagnosed and had surgery 
for her cancer 
she and others she said brought to the boards attention what 
they called serious tax abuses under humphrys leadership 
she said money was transferred from the society an educational 
nonprofit organization to politically active organizations a 
taxlaw violation 
humphry said the money was loaned to a group pushing for a 
righttodie ballot initiative in california and the irs questioned 
it 
humphry said there is a genuine difference of opinion over 
whether the transfers were legally proper 
members of the board of directors agreed 
this is something that was done in consultation with 
attorneys said batt who works as a tax policy analyst for the 
new york legislature this is not a case of one person blowing a 
whistle it is a difference among experts

world leaders welcomed south africas announcement 
saturday of nelson mandelas impending release from prison and 
international rejoicing began to build for an event so long awaited 
by so many 
britain said it was time to resume contacts with the 
internationally isolated pretoria government but antiapartheid 
campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure on south 
africas whiteled government 
president bush praised south african president fw de klerk for 
bold and imaginative leadership and the canadian government 
expressed delight at the announcement mandela would be released 
sunday 
in lusaka zambian president kenneth launda whose country has 
been a refuge for the exiled leadership of mandelas african 
national congress said his first reaction was to kneel down and 
thank god 
really we must believe in the leadership of the people of 
south africa to put their heads together and build on these 
developments kaunda said 
mandelas release will enable anc leaders to begin talking 
across color and any other artificial barriers kaunda said 
those things such as police brutality we can expect from time to 
time but the main thing is that the entire leadership should get 
together 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 for leading the anc into a 
guerrilla campaign against the whitedominated governments policy 
of apartheid which denies the black majority the right to vote 
on feb 2 de klerk stunned south africans by lifting a 30year 
ban on the anc ending bans and restrictions on dozens of 
opposition groups scrapping some stateofemergency regulations 
and declaring a moratorium on hangings 
hours after the announcement of mandelas release date the 
ancs leadership announced from its headquarters in lusaka zambia 
we welcome nelson mandela back from all those years of 
imprisonment into our midst with great joy 
anc executive committee member james stuart predicted mandela 
would probably concentrate on mobilizing our people and the unity 
of our people and will participate in all kinds of activities 
which will march foward toward the end of the apartheid system 
ireland rejoices that nelson mandela is free at last said 
charles haughey irish prime minister and current president of the 
european economic community which has been using economic 
sanctions to pressure pretoria to give up apartheid 
by his indomitable courage he has demonstrated once again that 
the human spirit can never be vanquished haughey said 
egyptian president hosni mubarak current chairman of the 
organization of african unity sent mandela a message of 
congratulation praising the sacrifices of the great people of 
south africa and assuring him of egyptian solidarity with his 
cause 
in the soviet union moscow radio broadcast news of the 
announcement then added nelson mandela has become the worlds 
most famous political prisoner put in jail for the struggle 
against apartheid in south africa 
amsterdams central leidseplein square was temporarily 
rechristened nelson mandela square 
in london a jubilant crowd of about 120 some waving pictures 
of mandela celebrated in the pouring rain outside south africa 
house in trafalgar square 
in a statement released by her 10 downing st office mrs 
thatcher said we believe that the steps president de klerk has 
taken merit a positive practical response 
we believe it no longer makes sense to discourage new 
investment in south africa a restraint which in our case in any 
event has been voluntary and we shall be discussing this with our 
ec partners she said 
in 1986 the ec banned imports of south african iron steel and 
kruggerand gold coins and barred new investment in the country it 
had already frozen scientific and cultural relations 
britain regards the iron steel and coin embargoes as mandatory 
but not the investment ban and has already announced that it is no 
longer observing the scientific and cultural embargo 
in a statement released from the presidential retreat at camp 
david md bush said i welcome this move and view it as another 
significant step on the road to the nonracial democratic south 
africa which we all desire 
bush reiterated his intention to invite mandela and de klerk to 
the white house in separate visits and said president de klerk 
has shown bold and imaginative leadership in recent days which has 
earned the admiration of many of us who hope for swift and peaceful 
evolution in south africa 
in london bob hughes chairman of the antiapartheid movement 
said he was delighted at the news which he called a tremendous 
victory for the people of south africa and for the international 
sanctions campaign 
commonwealth secretarygeneral sir shridath ramphal said 
mandelas safety must be guaranteed by the south african government 
and that until change there became irreversible the commonwealth 
would sustain its pressure for apartheids end it is not yet 
time to demobilize the international support for apartheids 
victims he said

troops of gen michel aoun captured a 
strategic town saturday that was a stronghold of rival christian 
forces and opened a new front in the war for control of lebanons 
christian region police said 
a communique from aouns command said his soldiers took 34 
prisoners in the attack on kleiat 15 miles northeast of beirut in 
the mountainous province of kesrouan the rival lebanese forces 
militia claimed its fighters counterattacked and drove back aouns 
men 
the battle for kesrouan has begun said a police spokesman 
who could not be named under standing rules kleiats capture 
opens the way for aouns army to punch deep into the region 
if aouns forces are able to oust the lebanese forces from 
kesrouan that would enable them to attack the important port of 
jounieh from dbaye in the south and kesrouan in the north aoun 
fighters seized dbaye last week 
jounieh is the largest lebanese forces base in the embattled 
christian enclave and the militias main harbor 
there was no updated word on casualties before the news from 
kleiat the toll from the 12day confrontation between aouns army 
and the lebanese forces militia of samir geagea was 433 killed and 
1684 wounded 
the intrachristian fighting is the worst in lebanons 
15yearold civil war 
aoun and geagea both have been at odds with syria which 
maintains 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate but aoun has accused geagea of trying to enforce an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan that he opposed 
aoun attacked the pact because it set no date for the withdrawal 
of the syrian troops 
geageas headquarters said his militiamen in kleiat retreated 
saturday to draw in and contain aouns attacking force and then 
counterattacked 
we drove them back in a ninehour battle they left behind 
five destroyed tanks and 15 armored personnel carriers said the 
communique 
the police spokesman refused to comment on the conflicting 
claims 
both sides dueled with howitzers mortars and machine guns all 
day in beiruts christian sector snipers prevented rescuers from 
retrieving bodies and corpses were left to rot on the streets 
civil defense rescuers believe some of the corpses are 
boobytrapped and thats why the combatants want to keep them 
there a police spokesman said 
a police spokesman said three people were killed and four 
wounded in the shelling before it subsided into intermittent 
exchanges around 10 am 
the shelling broke out when a unit of geageas 6000man militia 
used dynamite to blast the daraya bridge northeast of beirut and 
block any possible tank attack by aouns 19000 troops 
aouns gunners shelled the militia squad as it was returning to 
base and geageas men responded 
hundreds of civilians fled the 310squaremile christian enclave 
to safe areas in west beirut south east and north lebanon 
the blasting of the daraya bridge came two days after geageas 
militia blocked with rocks concrete and mines a 500yard tunnel on 
the coastal highway linking aouns territory with kesrouan 
aouns command issued a communique saying geageas militia by 
blowing up the daraya bridge violated a ceasefire called two days 
ago 
shortly before dusk aouns radio lebanon said geageas gunners 
were shelling the generals defense ministry in yarze east of 
beirut 
the police spokesman said the situation in the christian enclave 
does not indicate that a ceasefires going to hold 
the voice of lebanon an antiaoun christian radio station that 
is the mouthpiece of the phalange party reported a mutiny among 
aouns troops as they and geageas militia appeared geared for 
another round of allout fighting 
the station broadcast a statement by col paul faris who 
declared creation of the neutral army forces with headquarters 
in the coastal town of amsheet which is controlled by geagea 
forces 
he urged fellow soldiers to refuse aouns orders and 
immediately join the ranks of the neutral army forces leave aouns 
army now before its too late 
addressing the 54yearold aoun faris said you are a 
criminal general responsible for all the massacres being 
committed against your people the least you deserve is execution 
by a firing squad 
shortly after broadcasting faris communique voice of lebanon 
said it received calls from several army units declaring support 
for the mutiny the reports could not be independently confirmed 
aouns command released a statement that called faris a 
mutineer who had joined the gunmen a while ago and is wanted by 
justice 
it said those declaring support for faris are prisoners 
captured by the gunmen in the early days of the battle 
a military source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
faris mutiny is obviously coordinated with geagea to make it 
easier for aouns men to defect to a christian army command 
rather than taking the tough decision of declaring loyalty to 
the syrianbacked command of gen emile lahoud 
lahoud who has headquarters in west beirut commands the 22000 
predominantly moslem soldiers who are based in syriancontrolled 
territories of lebanon

the superpowers on saturday announced preliminary 
agreement on a us plan for a 10year phaseout of their chemical 
weapons stockpiles that links their total elimination to a 
negotiated worldwide ban 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told a news 
conference after three days of talks with us secretary of state 
james a baker iii that the superpowers reached accord on the draft 
of a prospective agreement of principle 
we believe such an agreement could be signed during president 
gorbachevs visit to the united states he added 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is to travel to washington in 
june to meet with president bush 
the announcement had been expected after the lengthy talks baker 
had with shevardnadze and gorbachev in moscow 
in a joint statement carried by the official soviet news agency 
tass the united states and soviet union pledged to work out an 
agreement for destruction of a significant part of their 
chemical arsenals the agreed reductions would put their stocks at 
equally low levels while 40nation talks on a worldwide ban 
continue in geneva 
when an international ban on the development production use 
and possession of chemical weapons enters into force the united 
states and soviet union will further cut stocks to a very small 
fraction of current arsenals over an eightyear period the 
statement said 
in the following two years remaining us and soviet chemical 
weapons would be destroyed it said 
the statement said all states capable of manufacturing chemical 
weapons must adhere to the convention indicating that if any third 
country refused to join a ban the superpowers would not be 
obligated to liquidate their remaining stockpiles 
only the united states and soviet union admit to having chemical 
weapons although a dozen nations including libya and iraq are 
thought to have production capability 
the geneva conference negotiating a global chemical weapons ban 
opened its 1990 session wednesday the conference dates to 1968 
diplomats for years have forecast an agreement soon although 
progress in separate bilateral ussoviet talks that began five 
years ago have now spurred optimism that a treaty might be signed 
within a year 
in december the superpowers exchanged confidential data on the 
size of their arsenals the chief soviet negotiator at the geneva 
negotiations sergei batsanov said last month there was no 
surprise implying his country believes it backed up its public 
claim that it has no more than 50000 tons of chemical arms 
some us analysts however have said the soviet arsenal is 
more than six times larger than that batsanovs former us 
counterpart at the geneva talks max friedersdorf said in december 
the soviets have considerably more than 50000 tons us 
stockpiles are estimated at 30000 tons 
in september bush offered to destroy 80 percent of the us 
chemical arsenal before an international treaty is reached if 
moscow follows suit the soviets however said then such 
reductions should be accompanied by a halt to production of new 
chemical weapons 
that demand would put an end to the us program to replace part 
of its obsolete stockpile with modern binary chemical weapons 
composed of two relatively harmless agents that become dangerous 
when mixed 
the ussoviet statement issued saturday said only that the 
international treaty should provide for a halt to production of new 
chemical weapons meaning us manufacture of binaries could 
continue until such a pact enters into force

president bush telephoned president fw de 
klerk on saturday to praise his planned release of imprisoned black 
activist nelson mandela and pledge us willingness to help 
create a climate for negotiations between black and white south 
africans an aide said 
de klerks announcement that mandela would be set free on sunday 
opens the way for lifting of us sanctions against pretoria one 
administration official said 
during their fiveminute conversation bush invited de klerk to 
meet with him at the white house and told him he was issuing the 
same invitation to mandela said white house spokesman john herrick 
he also expressed his admiration for the significant 
initiatives anounced by the south african government in recent 
days and reiterated his hope there would be continued progress 
toward a negotiated solution in an atmosphere of nonviolence 
herrick said of the call bush made from the presidential retreat at 
camp david md 
bush was joined at camp david by vice president dan quayle 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and nato secretary 
general manfred woerner the four discussed changes in eastwest 
relations and th future of the north atlantic treaty organization 
president bush stated us willingness to help create a 
climate for negotiations and his plan to continue meeting with a 
broad spectrum of south african leaders herrick said of the call 
to de klerk 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii in sofia 
bulgaria where he met with government and opposition leaders 
said i think thats really a very significant move by the south 
african government lets hope that this is a step on the road to a 
democatic nonracial government in south africa 
president de klerk has taken a number of actions recently that 
we can only characterize as very very endouraging he added 
baker recalled bush had said release of mandela from prison 
could lead to a visit to washington by him and deklerk 
de klerks announcement that he would free mandela and lift the 
national state of emergency within a few weeks would fulfill two of 
the five conditions set out in us law for lifting the economic 
sanctions against the apartheid government 
its quite possible that within the next few weeks that four 
out of the five will have been fulfilled which gives the president 
the authority to remove the economic sanctions said herman j 
cohen assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
in a statement released from camp david bush said president 
de klerk has shown bold and imaginative leadership in recent days 
which has earned the admiration of many of us who hope for swift 
and peaceful evolution in south africa 
under the law passed by congress in 1986 the president can 
suspend or modify the sanctions if mandela and other political 
prisoners are released and pretoria meets at least three of the 
other conditions lifting the state of emergency legalizing 
political participation for all parties repealing laws that 
regulate where nonwhites can live and work and beginning 
goodfaith negotiations with the black majority 
if the administration determines four of the conditions have 
been met cohen said bush will consult with congress on easing the 
sanctions 
he said the bush administration is actively looking at all of 
these details involved in de klerks pronouncements including a 
review of political prisoners and whether any of them remain 
jailed de klerk has previously freed several highprofile 
political prisoners 
he also recently lifted the ban on mandelas african national 
congress and other opposition political organizations and said he 
would negotiate with black leaders on a new constitution 
the us sanctions include a ban on importing south african 
steel textiles uranium coal and agricultural produce they also 
bar new us investment in south africa forbid new bank loans and 
end us landing rights for south african airways 
one administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said it was likely bush would back a partial easing of sanctions 
not a complete removal once the conditions are met 
that would leave him some leverage with pretoria to continue 
pressing for an end to apartheid that countrys policy of racial 
separation the source said 
bush did not mention the sanctions question in his statement 
saturday but he said a week ago that he was willing to review the 
sanctions as new developments take place 
he said at that time i think when people move in the right 
direction it is certainly time to review all policy 
once mandela is free the lifting of the state of emergency will 
be the action that really triggers administration willingness 
to move on the sanctions said cohen 
however he added the president is clearly not going to make 
a decision without consulting congress 
mandela 71 has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for helping plan the start of a sabotage campaign by the 
african national congress 
in his dramatic announcement saturday de klerk said the 
3yearold state of emergency would be lifted in a few weeks if no 
further unrest accompanies mandelas release and promised to 
negotiate the possible release of remaining political prisoners 
under the remaining restrictions police can still detain 
suspects for up to six months without charge ban protests and ban 
journalists or others from protests or areas of unrest 
bush was vice president in the reagan administration which 
fought the congressionally imposed sanctions

voyager 1 which joined its twin 
exploring the outer solar system will snap pictures this week to 
make an unprecedented family portrait of most of the planets and 
the vast empty space between them 
it will speak more to the mind than to the eye because of the 
tremendous distances what will be impressive will be the 
distances said jurrie van der woude a spokesman at nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory 
the complete portrait will be too large to be published but 
nasa may assemble the 64 eightby10inch photos into a mosaic 
stretching 100 to 150 feet along a wall at the laboratory 
neptune uranus saturn jupiter mars earth and venus will 
appear as tiny dots against a background of dark space and the 
constellation eridanus 
mercury will be hidden by the suns glare pluto is too distant 
to appear in any images 
while the solar system portrait wont have scientific value its 
purpose is really historical said bob macmillin a spokesman 
for the national aeronautics and space administration 
this is not just the first time but perhaps the only time for 
decades that well be able to take a picture of the planets from 
outside the solar system said voyager project scientist edward 
stone 
voyager 1 which is about 37 billion miles from earth will use 
its two cameras to photograph the planets and the sun between 515 
pm and 920 pm pst tuesday night 
because of other demands on nasa deep space network tracking 
antennas the photos wont be sent back to earth until late march 
and it will be late april until they are processed and can be 
assembled into a mosaic macmillin said 
the twin voyager spacecraft were launched from cape canaveral 
fla in 1977 and explored jupiter in 1979 voyager 2 explored 
saturn in 1981 uranus in 1986 and neptune last august voyager 1 
explored saturn in 1980 then flew above the plane in which the 
planets orbit the sun known as the ecliptic plane 
photographing the sun for the solar system portrait may warp the 
shutter blades on voyager 1s wideangle camera but there are no 
plans to use the camera again anyway nasa said 
voyager 1 will take the photos for the solar system portrait by 
looking down from a position 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane 
stone said no future missions are planned that would send a 
spacecraft so high above the ecliptic plane 
voyager 1 was chosen to make the photograph because it is in 
better position that voyager 2 
both spacecraft are now studying electrically charged particles 
and magnetic fields as they fly toward interstellar space they are 
expected to return at least limited measurements for another 25 to 
30 years

the top soviet official in charge of food supplies 
has warned that meat production already woefully inadequate could 
fall further because of a lack of grain used to fatten livestock 
in a speech to a meeting of communist party leaders this week 
vladilen v nikitin head of the state committee on food said the 
soviet union has been unable to grow the amount of grain mandated 
by the economic plan 
nikitin also said in remarks published in fridays edition of 
the communist party daily pravda that the government has been 
unable to buy an additional 5 million tons of grain from foreign 
sources needed to supply the country that will mean less fodder 
for animals he said 
there is no grain because there are no production means 
there are no other reasons pravda quoted nikitin as saying 
in some soviet cities meat is rationed with people receiving as 
little as the equivalent of two or three goodsized hot dogs per 
month 
in remarks published thursday nikitin said soviet agricultural 
production represents onethird of the national income but does not 
receive adequate equipment 
government statistics for 1989 published last week showed that 
after an investment of 110 billion in agriculture last year 
soviet food production rose only 1 percent and not the 66 percent 
expected 
the soviet government had hoped the program would help it obtain 
additional grain more cheaply than by buying it in the west but 
authorities were still forced to import nearly 40 million tons last 
year 1 million more than in 1988

miles of southern california 
beaches were closed saturday as cleanup crews tried to sop up a 
black tide and officials revised the size of the american trader 
oil spill up to 394000 gallons 
the 12milelong slick stained beaches threatened wildlife 
habitats and taxed crews dabbing at the onslaught with absorbent 
pads 
oil got through a boom across the santa ana river and caused 
damage there the coast guard said but booms guarding other inlets 
to ecologically sensitive wetlands areas were not breached 
twentysix sea birds were reported to have been killed by the 
spill and 60 birds were under care after cleaning 
authorities warned wouldbe volunteers to stay away because of 
the toxicity of the contamination and the hazard from heavy 
equipment being used in the shoreline cleanup effort 
the public can be a hazard in this process if they dont let 
the professionals come in and do their work said ray picard 
fire chief and civil defense director of huntington beach 
closed to the public were 9 miles of sand from seal beach south 
through sunset beach bolsa chica state beach and huntingtion city 
and state beaches farther south newport beach also warned the 
public off its beaches 
before lifeguards ordered spectators and volunteer cleaners to 
leave the shoreline saturday morning david manier 16 of la habra 
and two buddies walked along huntington beach picking up blobs of 
oil 
we come down here almost every weekend to bodyboard and 
stuff said manier this is just really bad 
the main body of oil lurked offshore but winds and tides have 
pushed fingers of the slick ashore at various points along the 
entire 18mile stretch since thursday evening 24 hours after the 
tanker began leaking 
the spills estimated size was revised upward by nearly 
onethird to 394000 gallons coast guard capt jim card told a 
news conference 
the slick had elongated to measure 12 miles by 3 miles and was 
centered 2 miles off the coast between huntington beach and 
newport beach some spots of oil were seen as far north as the long 
beach harbor entrance 
a fleet of skimmer boats had recovered about 900 barrels of oil 
by friday night card said eight skimmers were at work and two 
more were due saturday 
the coast guard meanwhile continued to pump oil from the 
811foot tanker which apparently punctured itself twice on its own 
anchor about 430 pm wednesday while mooring in shallow water at 
an offshore oil pipeline 
the accident remained under investigation the coast guard said 
drug and alcohol tests on the ships officers including capt 
robert laware were negative 
mike murphy vice president of american trading and 
transportation co said divers inspected the hull and made a 
videotape on friday 
there are very very sharp indents they almost look like the 
fluke of an anchor might have done it murphy said theres no 
doubt in our mind that either our anchor or something like an 
anchor did it were not exactly sure it was ours 
however i cannot explain the fact that i have a port anchor 
on the vessel damaged to the point that i have to take it off the 
ship and replace it 
the 90000 barrels of oil that did not leak from the punctured 
tank was transferred to a barge on friday card said completion of 
that process allowed for the more accurate assessment of how much 
oil actually got out resulting in the increase 
the tanker will move from its anchorage off huntington beach 
under its own power with 460000 barrels of oil still aboard in 
other holds murphy said

the operators of washingtons dulles 
international airport say a planned sequel to the action thriller 
die hard creates such a bad image of it that people may want to 
take off and land elsewhere 
the movie die hard ii die harder will show airport 
operations in a manner that will unquestionably undermine public 
confidence in the airport and in air travel attorney edward s 
faggen said in a letter last week to 20th century fox 
the script calls for a deposed latin american dictatordrug 
runner to be flown to washington for trial but a band of 
rightwing overzealous former us military officers believing 
that the dictator was an american ally decide to take over the 
airport and free him 
one plane crashes and others are forced to circle above running 
low on fuel until detective john mcclane played again by bruce 
willis shootshis way to the rescue 
faggen legal counsel to the metropolitan washington airports 
authority said the script reflects a reckless disregard for the 
truth or the reality of the airport and airport operations 
the script depicts some dulles management and employes in a 
loathsome and contemptible manner faggen added 
fox officials said the film would include a disclaimer 
identifying it as fiction but faggen said fox should give the 
airport a fictitious name and remove all references to dulles 
but the company has no plans to change the name spokesman 
dennis petroskey said the washington locale is very important to 
the story line 
the film is actually filmed at denvers stapleton international 
fox however is free to take exterior shots of dulles for the 
movie without permission faggen said

president kenneth kaunda one of the 
staunchest critics of the south african government said saturday 
he hoped the release of nelson mandela would lead to negotiations 
between the government and south african black leaders 
kaunda said he looked forward to serious negotiations starting 
as quickly as possible because i dont think we have the time to 
waste 
the zambian leader said his first reaction to news of the 
african national congress leaders scheduled release sunday was to 
pray 
i knelt down and prayed the first thing i did was to say 
thank god he is great said kaunda a lay preacher and former 
schoolteacher 
zambia is the external headquarters of the anc which until feb 
2 was outlawed in south africa 
in the groups first official reaction to de klerks 
announcement senior anc official james stuart called it very 
exciting news 
we welcome nelson mandela back from all those years of 
imprisonment into our midst with great joy stuart a member of 
the anc national executive committee told reporters 
it is really a turning point in our history something we and 
the whole world have been demanding he said 
stuart said the external anc leaders expected mandela to visit 
them in zambia at some point in the future to take up his place 
as the formost leader of our organization 
de klerk said that mandela will be freed at 3 pm 8 am est 
sunday from the cape town prison farm where he has been serving a 
life term for plotting to overthrow the whiteled government 
we can hardly believe it it is a little bit unreal now is 
the time for great celebrations for the anc and for our people at 
home and for all those who supported us over the many years said 
stuart 
stuart asked about possible anc policy changes in the wake of 
mandelas release said the groups leaders were scheduled to hold 
a series of meetings in lusaka 
i cannot say how we are going to react in the sense of what we 
are going to do immediately but we are certainly very happy he 
said 
kaunda said the months ahead would probably be a very trying 
period in south africa 
we cannot expect things to start moving quickly and smoothly 
all at once the greatest thing is that nelson mandela will be out 
of prison tomorrow this will enable the anc leaders to begin to 
get together the rest of the leadership in south africa and begin 
talking across color and any other artificial barriers he said

the perrier group of america inc began 
removing its bottled mineral water from us stores on saturday and 
shut down its francebased bottling operation after finding benzene 
in some samples 
benzene is considered a poison but a food and drug 
administration spokesman said saturday the levels detected in fda 
tests of perrier water pose no immediate health risk 
if i had a bottle in the refrigerator i would drink it 
said acting fda commissioner james benson 
benzene is a clear flammable poisonous liquid used as a 
solvent for fats and in making lacquers varnishes and dyes at 
high enough doses it has been linked to cancer in animals 
ronald v davis president of greenwichbased perrier group of 
america which distributes the bottled water in the united states 
characterized the presence of benzene as a freak accident 
the company believes the chemicals presence was caused by a 
human error in france either in the production of the glass 
bottles the bottling of the water or its transportation davis 
said at a news conference saturday 
there is no reason at all it should be in our product he 
said we dont understand it 
he said the company has ruled out sabotage and has found no 
evidence of benzene in the natural underground mineral spring in 
vergeze france where the water is drawn and bottled by a 
127yearold french company 
we are not producing at all until we are sure we have found 
this needle in a haystack he said 
the company plans to destroy its entire us inventory about 72 
million bottles and has directed distributors to start pulling the 
water from stores shelves davis said 
the company hopes to resume production very very soon he 
said but plans on losing two or three months worth of sales 
about 40 million because of the depletion of inventory and the 
halt in bottling 
perrier has not detected benzene in european samples and has no 
plans to recall the drink from european stores davis said 
the bubbly water sold in distinctive green bottles has 
acquired great popularity in the us as a healthy upscale soft 
drink the company estimates annual us sales at 150 million 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the agency found levels of 
benzene in perrier samples at two to four times the environmental 
protection agencys standard for drinking water the standard is 5 
parts per billion and the levels found ranged from 12 to 20 parts 
per billion he said 
the elevated levels were discovered by north carolina health 
officials during routine testing 
however nesbit said the fdas health evaluation board 
concluded that there is no immediate health risk people can 
continue drinking perrier 
these are fairly low levels and theres a negligible risk 
involved here he said 
a lifetime of drinking water with these levels of benzene would 
increase the risk of cancer by one in a million which is generally 
recognized as negligible he said 
nonetheless the company felt its actions were warranted to 
restore consumer confidence davis said were in the integrity 
business selling purity and quality 
the company will offer refunds to customers and has established 
a tollfree number for consumer complaints or inquiries he said 
in paris a spokeswoman for the french health ministry confirmed 
that there is no contamination at the spring tests at perriers 
source are done regularly by the local office of the direction 
generale de la sante 
french health minister claude evin has asked perrier to test 
some of the bottles and cans of water in france to make sure there 
is not a similar problem to the one in the united states the 
company is expected to begin testing the water next week

a woman whose initial refusal to have a 
gangrenous leg amputated led to a court battle thanked doctors 
saturday after they removed the infected limb her grandson said 
doctors amputated ruth trabelsis right leg just above the knee 
friday night she developed gangrene in the foot as a complication 
from hardening of the arteries and blood clotting 
after the operation she said i hope its all over and they 
wont have to take off anymore said peres trabelsi a grandson 
of the 84yearold woman 
she thanked the doctors but shes groggy now and has a little 
trouble breathing so we told her not to speak he said in a 
telephone interview from poriah hospital in tiberias 
trabelsi said doctors listed his grandmother in moderate 
condition 
mrs trabelsi initially refused to have the operation saying 
she wanted to enter the garden of eden on both feet doctors 
said she would die without the surgery 
the case went to court last week under a law that requires the 
state to protect people who may not be capable of making decisions 
for themselves 
but the government dropped the case after a geriatric specialist 
testified that mrs trabelsi was lucid and fully capable of making 
her own decisions 
some of the womans 258 children grandchildren and 
greatgrandchildren however continued to press the woman to have 
the surgery 
only on friday did mrs trabelsi consent to the amputation after 
a visit from mordechai eliahu chief rabbi of israels sephardic 
jews those of middle east and african origin 
eliahu who flew from jerusalem to tiberias by helicopter had 
said that if she refused the amputation of the gangreneinfected 
leg she would be violating religious law by in effect committing 
suicide

opposition parties said they will tell 
secretary of state james a baker iii on sunday that an interim 
government running the country until may elections is merely a 
guise for the old communist party 
its a dictate raul volcinski economic adviser to the 
centerright democratic christian union said saturday 
the interim government the council of national unity is a 
multiparty body formed friday it replaced the national salvation 
fronts ruling council that took power from hardline communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu in decembers revolution and executed 
him 
the front stepped aside after reversing an earlier pledge not to 
field its own candidates in the may 20 election but opposition 
leaders say the new council of national unity is packed with front 
supporters and former leaders of the nowdefunct communist party 
the front is the second edition of the communist party 
volcinski said 
a leading ceausescu critic who quit the fronts ruling council 
was quoted in an interview published saturday as saying the west 
should stop all economic aid to romania pending the creation of 
democracy in the country 
the revolution in favor of democracy and against communism is 
in great danger said doina cornea quoted by the frenchlanguage 
newspaper tribune de geneve in an interview at her home in the 
western town of cluj 
baker who planned a fourhour stopover in bucharest sunday 
morning en route to canada will be the highestranking us 
official to visit romania since the revolution washington welcomed 
the uprising but last month protested what it called the national 
salvation fronts intimidation of opposition parties 
baker was to meet interim president ion iliescu premier petre 
roman opposition leaders students and the ethnic hungarian priest 
laszlo toekes whose expulsion from the western city of timisoara 
sparked the revolution 
the council of national unity held its inaugural meeting on 
friday and iliescu praised it for reaching consensus a view backed 
by some political parties 
but the major opposition parties said they will tell baker that 
there was anything but consensus and they accused iliescu of using 
steamroller tactics to keep the fronts grip on power 
the council of unity expanded the number of people on the body 
from the 180 on the fronts council iliescu said it would have 253 
members but romanian reporters following the proceedings which 
were not open to the foreign news media counted 259 members 
tariceanu said iliescu ignored an agreement to limit the number 
of parties in the council to 30 and packed the nonparty bloc of 
seats entirely with front members 
other party representatives also charged that the party bloc 
included bogus parties created by the front for the purpose of 
assuring its majority 
it is very obvious to all the people that they tried to create 
the impression that the political parties are fighting for power 
which is not true said calin tariceanu a member of the national 
liberal partys top organizing committee 
but it was the front who were demonstrating that they did not 
want to share power they want to remain the leading force that is 
obvious he said 
the fronts decision to field candidates in the may election 
sparked widespread protests by opposition parties and students who 
were in the forefront of the revolution they demanded that the 
front resign arguing that it couldnt be both a referee and a 
player in the election 
the us protest on jan 30 followed the largest demonstrations 
in bucharest since the revolution in which profront demonstrators 
attacked the liberal party headquarters and attempted to get into 
the national peasant party headquarters twentysix offices of the 
peasant party around the country were attacked 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutweiler said the fronts 
intimidation appeared to be directed at legitimate organizations 
which are seeking a legitimate independent role in romanias new 
political order 
democratic christian union vice president voinea octavian 
charged that the front is using the still intact mechanism of 
ceausescus hated securitate secret police to intimidate and 
terrorize the political parties

three small children who attended a 
daycare center owned by a man arrested on pornography charges have 
been found to have gonorrhea sending distraught parents to a 
counseling center 
the youngsters ages 2 to 4 attended the rainbow learning 
center and were among 20 children identified from thousands of nude 
photographs found at the home of the centers owner john w 
shaver police said 
police announced friday that throat cultures done on the three 
children turned up the disease which is usually transmitted 
through sexual contact 
we have to find out where the infection came from fort 
lauderdale police spokesman ott cefkin said we have nothing that 
links shaver or the center with those three cases other people 
have had contact with these children 
all 20 youngsters identified from among 3200 photos of nude 
children found at shavers home were tested for gonorrhea as were 
other youngsters who attended the preschool 
results for the other children were pending saturday or had come 
back negative authorities said 
numerous worried parents not listed on the centers registry 
began to contact police after shavers arrest jan 28 on five 
felony counts of possessing child pornography in the form of 
magazines and other published material 
shaver 56 has not been charged in connection with the 
photographs of children the pictures do not depict sex acts or 
sexual poses but show the children at play authorities said 
police already know of more than 200 families who used the 
daycare center 
weve been counseling the parents said joanne richter 
director of the broward county sexual assault treatment center 
their state of mind ranges from disbelief to denial to anger and 
guilt that they sent their kids there 
after the announcement of the infections several parents 
contacted the treatment center to bring their children in for 
medical and psychological examinations or counseling cefkin said 
in such an alarming situation the parents feel better if they 
know whats going on ms richter said 
shaver ran a daycare center in hawaii in the mid1980s but it 
was closed in 1984 amid allegations that he fondled young girls at 
the center he was never charged and denied any wrongdoing 
shaver who posted 5000 bond on the florida charges denied 
any improper actions with children he tried to commit suicide feb 
2 by slashing a wrist and was undergoing treatment at a mental 
health center authorities said 
although the photographs themselves are not pornographic under 
the law they could lead to sexual exploitation accusations against 
shaver if the evidence meets that criteria police have said

rather than under the secrecy of night 
now she hopes trustworthy advisers will help him as he takes 
his first steps from imprisoned martyrdom to the downtoearth 
reality of life as a black leader 
he has to stop living now as this martyr this god and live 
as a human being said makaziwe mandelaamuah a fulbright 
scholar studying anthropology 
saturday morning just an hour after south african president 
fw de klerk announced that mandela would be freed unconditionally 
sunday afternoon the phone ran incessantly at his daughters 
apartment near the university of massachusetts 
mandelaamuah who is known as maki and lives in this college 
town with her husband and three children was elated by the news 
but her responsibilities as a mother took first priority she said 
she would spend the day with her children at a dinosaur exhibit she 
had promised them 
she said however she would be in church sunday to thank god 
it finally happened 
that will be my celebration said mandelaamuah whose 
father was jailed more than 27 years ago when she was 8 years old 
mandelaamuah the youngest of three children from mandelas 
first marriage said she didnt expect to visit her father before 
summer because until then he would likely be caught up in political 
matters 
what i want is that quality time said mandelaamuah who 
says she will be getting to know her 71yearold father for the 
first time i am selfish in that way but really i have to be 
selfish 
it had been rumored that mandela would be smuggled out at night 
to avoid the protests of political extremists but mandelaamuah 
said it would have been hypocritical for her father to leave prison 
under the protection of a regime he had battled for years 
he cant accept their security he has to walk out in the 
open she said its not that i dont have fear that my father 
is in great danger i am worried about that 
mandela imprisoned for his role in planning the african 
national congress guerilla campaign against white minority rule 
will likely receive protection from anc after his release his 
daughter said 
meanwhile at a news conference in boston activist patrick 
lekota said mandelas release was a victory in the battle against 
apartheid in south africa 
short of national liberation nelsons release marks total 
victory said lekota a spokesman for the united democratic front 
in south africa 
from here we can scale the heights said lekota who was in 
town to participate in an international conference on nonviolent 
political action sponsored by the einstein institution 
at a separate press conference later in boston mandelas eldest 
daughter zenani mandeladlamini said she was excited that her 
father was being freed 
this is what weve worked for all these years she said 
adding that there were still many problems in her country 
mandeladlamini 31 a student at boston university was 
accompanied at the press conference by her husband thumbumuzi and 
her two daughters and son 
im proud of who he is she said i know he has a job to 
do outside

the street saturday to celebrate nelson mandelas imminent release 
and other neighbors in this black township outside johannesburg 
sang and danced near the jailed leaders home 
in kathlehong another black township southeast of johannesburg 
police said five blacks were killed and 45 injured after officers 
used tear gas and birdshot to disperse a crowd of antiapartheid 
protesters police would not give further details saturday night 
he rally was held shortly after the whitedominated government 
announced the 71yearold leader of the african national congress 
will be freed sunday after 27 years of imprisonment 
come come come mandela women and children sang in zulu 
outside the small brick home that mandelas family has rented for 
40 years in the old orlando section of soweto 
tutu who lives a few blocks away came out of his home 
laughing its a happy day he said and began to dance 
commenting that he had never before given the popular viva 
black freedom salute tutu decided this was the time and he 
shouted viva 
as he was driven away in a car tutu looked out the window and 
yelled yaaaayyyyyyyyy waving to a few people gathered around 
in johnannesburg late saturday night more than 3000 blacks 
marched to celebrate mandelas scheduled release some ran as 
police cars followed others gathered in groups shouting viva 
mandela welcome to our leader 
women hugged sunday editions of newspapers bearing mandelas 
picture to their breasts kissing the photograph and shrieking with 
delight cars honked their horns and people waved from the 
balconies of apartment buildings 
a few whites gave anc salutes and there were a few in the 
procession others looked terrified shrinking against buildings as 
the marchers passed 
when some young blacks spat at white bystanders other blacks 
stopped them many white motorists honked their horns seriously and 
some drove at high speed sending black marchers scattering but 
causing no injuries 
some whites in highrise apartments hurled bottles as a column 
of marchers shadowed by police cars reached the multiracial 
neighborhood of hillbrow no one was hit young blacks pantomimed 
firing at police with makebelieve sovietdesigned ak47 automatic 
rifles the symbol of the ancs military wing 
but tutu said one of mandelas main tasks would be to try to 
bring south africans together and obtain social justice for blacks 
what nelson is going to be doing is to focus all those 
aspirations of the people and well be able to draw people of 
different points of view together in bringing about this new 
nonracial nonsexist democratic south africa tutu said 
president fw de klerk told a news conference in cape town that 
mandela would be freed at the gates of victor verster prison on 
sunday afternoon 
the rest of the world heard the news before most south africans 
it was not broadcast on governmentrun radio and television until 
an hour later and a blackoriented tv channel did not interrupt 
its coverage of a soccer game but later the entire news conference 
was shown and the story took up all of the evening news programs 
most of sowetos 25 million people got news of mandelas 
release by word of mouth 
mandelas wife winnie attended a funeral earlier saturday for 
clayton sizwe sithole boyfriend of her youngest daughter 
zindziwe sithole was found hanging in a cell at police 
headquarters two weeks ago after being arrested in the 
investigation of a yearold murder 
mrs mandela wearing a khaki uniform and military cap with 
braiding and epaulettes in the gold green and black colors of the 
african national congress arrived at the modern house where she 
has lived for several years in a separate section of soweto called 
diepkloof 
a crowd of 50 women and children were already in the street 
around her home but de klerks announcement was five minutes away 
a woman who answered the phone at the old mandela home said the 
prisons service had been calling mrs mandela all day to alert her 
to the news 
when mrs mandela finally heard she came out of her house and 
got into a white car which was immediately surrounded and halted 
by singing dancing neighbors she repeatedly reached out the 
window of the passenger side to shake hands with wellwishers but 
made no comment 
there was more cheering and dancing when she stopped briefly at 
the old mandela home where an anc flag flies from the roof 
wilton mkwayi a member of mandelas first guerrilla unit who 
was freed from a life prison term along with other anc leaders last 
october has been occupying the old mandela home 
we naturally feel very jovial it is a moment that for 28 
years we have waited for impatiently said popo molefe a leader 
of the united democratic front the nations largest antiapartheid 
coalition which de klerk legalized on feb 2 
his release has come as a result of the ordinary struggles 
taking place on the ground molefe said as he entered the mandela 
home for a meeting of black leaders

the rev jesse jackson said 
saturday he intends to be at the gates of the prison when nelson 
mandela walks out a free man 
jackson on his first visit here in a decade called president 
fw de klerks announcement that mandela will be released sunday 
a hopeful step in the right direction 
but he added he mandela is out of jail but not free not 
free to move to the neighborhood of his choice not free to send 
his grandchildren to the school of his choice not free to vote 
not free to run for office in his own country 
jackson also told a news conference that police had fired at a 
crowd of 2000 people who gathered in a township to greet him and 
one man was wounded 
police said a black man in possession of a south african 
security force rifle had fired at an opposing group and at 
police and that police returned fire but the man escaped 
police made no mention of injuries but said none of the 
vehicles in jacksons entourage was hit 
jackson said his aides were trying to contact a cabinet minister 
about the shooting 
if the police who reacted this way to 2000 people display 
the same mentality when tens of thousands of people are on the 
streets to welcome mandela what could be an occasion of great hope 
could be a disaster said jackson who has run two unsuccessful 
campaigns for the democratic partys presidential nomination 
jackson praised de klerks bold and courageous acts but said 
the president must be encouraged to dismantle apartheid 
he said he was worried about the powers police continue to wield 
under the national state of emergency which de klerk has said will 
be ended in a few weeks if political unrest does not erupt with 
mandelas release 
police currently are authorized to take any action they see fit 
to protect law and order and they can order gatherings to disperse 
within seconds 
i would not like to think what would happen if any policeman 
were to use his awesome powers under the state of emergency when 
mr mandela is on the streets or meeting people jackson said 
it would cause the kind of disaster nobody not even mr mandela 
could turn around 
jacksons comments and activities were heavily covered by the 
media at the start of his visit on thursday and friday there were 
a couple dozen reporters at his news conference on saturday but 
his trip by then had been overshadowed by news of mandelas release

hundreds of extreme rightwingers 
yelling hang mandela marched through the streets with swastika 
flags saturday to demand the overthrow of president fw de klerk 
members of the afrikaner resistance movement dressed in khaki 
uniforms and armed with whips knives and pistols marched to 
government headquarters with a tiny white coffin representing 
whites killed in terrorist attacks marchers dumped the coffin 
after police refused to accept it 
hang de klerk and we are ready to fight the column of 
about 2000 marchers yelled on their way to the union buildings 
hang mandela 
the march began before de klerk made the longawaited 
announcement that black leader nelson mandela would be freed from 
prison sunday but the news spread quickly among the demonstrators 
as the march progressed 
blacks throughout the country celebrated the news mandela 
leader of the african national congress has been in prison for 
more than 27 years 
police said five blacks were killed and 45 injured after 
officers fired birdshot and tear gas to break up an antiapartheid 
demonstration in the township of kathlehong outside johannesburg 
authorities provided no further details 
hundreds of police who authorized the white march in pretoria 
stood guard along the way marchers scuffled with some journalists 
and onlookers but there were no other incidents police ordered 
blacks to leave the area to avoid confrontations 
eugene terreblanche leader of the white resistance movement 
told about 3000 people at a rally before the march that de klerks 
plan to negotiate with blacks on extending some political rights to 
them was a betrayal of south africas white minority he said the 
governments move would trigger a massive white backlash 
we will launch a revolution to save our freedom he told the 
cheering crowd we wont give up a centimeter of south africa 
terreblanche said de klerks legalization of the anc and other 
antiapartheid groups feb 2 was an acceptance of terrorism he 
said the president was crippling the white security forces and 
preparing the way for black domination 
hes inviting the murderers of the anc to the table for 
talks terreblanche said 
his supporters including hundreds of men women and children in 
the groups khaki uniforms applauded and waved the groups 
swastikastyle red white and black flags some protesters carried 
nazi swastika flags 
no blacks and hitler was right said signs carried by 
marchers 
local journalists said the crowd attracted by the resistance 
movement was much larger than its other recent meetings in the 
pretoria area 
terreblanche tried to present 30 coins representing the 
biblical 30 pieces of silver paid to judas to betray jesus christ 
at the presidents office at the union buildings a senior police 
officer refused to accept the money and terreblanche hurled it on 
the ground 
judas come and fetch your money enraged marchers yelled 
hundreds of whites watched the march through the city many 
leaning out of apartment windows as the singing column passed but 
most people showed no sign of sympathy or support 
asked about de klerks announcement that mandela will be freed 
sunday terreblanche said he had no reaction he declined to 
comment on his plans beyond saying his group would call for a 
referendum to oust de klerk 
the group supports the continuation of white supremacist rule 
its support in the past has been confined to a few thousand members 
de klerk announced saturday that mandela would be released 
sunday after 27 years in jail as part of plans to begin 
negotiations with black leaders on extending political rights to 
blacks 
by law and custom south africas apartheid system establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services

inmates also includes guards and controls prostitution drugs and 
gambling at ohios maximumsecurity prison a legislative committee 
official alleges 
gov richard celeste on friday ordered an immediate and 
comprehensive investigation of gang activity at the southern ohio 
correctional facility at lucasville after the panel linked the 
group to the stabbings of four black inmates three of the inmates 
died of their wounds

inmates the whites have reportedly gained control over drug 
dealings prostitution and gambling within the facility davis

the prison has 2142 inmates 940 of whom are white 
in several other states prison officials said they use a divide 
and conquer approach to white supremacist groups in their prisons 
in california white supremacists have assaulted guards inside 
and outside prisons said tip kindel a california department of 
corrections official 
kindel said the problems peaked about five years ago to keep 
leaders from recruiting new members prison officials placed many 
of them in isolation he said

frequently within a prison and between prisons said veltry johnson 
of the department of corrections there 
in idaho where many supremacist groups often hold retreats

a 5weekold baby who underwent heart surgery 
before birth died from complications saturday after his parents and 
doctors decided to turn off his lifesupport systems hospital 
officials said 
doctors at guys hospital had described the two operations on 
the unborn child as the first successful prenatal heart surgery 
but dr michael tynan head of the surgery team said baby 
michele vermilios heart condition had taken a toll on his kidneys 
and they never improved enough to provide a proper blood supply to 
enable him to live without a ventilator 
if the ventilator supporting his lungs had been left running 
tynan said the baby would not have died but would have continued 
to suffer 
despite sedation and despite painkillers he was beginning to 
be very distressed tynan said 
kidney dialysis treatment which had been causing pain was 
stopped on friday 
hospital staff had continued to treat him with painkillers 
medication and food in case he was able to sustain life on his own 
a medical report said 
michele died within 45 minutes after the ventilator was shut 
off said tynan professor of pediatric cardiology at the hospital 
he died in his parents arms we were doing our best to ensure 
he did not have any unnecessary suffering tynan told a news 
conference 
the exact cause of death was not given 
he said the decision to turn off the ventilator which assisted 
the childs breathing was made by medical staff and the parents 
ann and bernard vermilio 
doctors said the baby suffered from a rare defect called 
critical aortic stenosis a blockage of the aortic valve in which 
blood cannot be pumped at the right pressure heart failure can 
result 
lindsay allan the doctor in charge of the fetal cardiology 
unit said most fetuses with the defect die in the womb and the few 
who survive birth do not live more than a day 
she said the two operations on the fetus involved inserting a 
catheter a slender tube down a hollow needle directly into the 
chest wall and heart 
once in place the tiny plastic balloon measuring 11 of an 
inch was inflated with a saline solution to open the heart valve 
ms allan said 
the mother received a local anesthetic and was awake during both 
operations 
there was no indication that the fetus felt anything said 
darryl maxwell director of the hospitals fetal medicine unit who 
monitored the surgery with an ultrasonic scanner

nelson mandela the symbol of 
south african blacks struggle for equality will become a free man 
sunday after 27 years in prison for fighting whiteminority rule 
president fw de klerk announced 
de klerk said saturday he hoped the longawaited release would 
halt decades of racial conflict and clear the way for negotiations 
that would extend political rights to the black majority 
the release will bring us to the end of a long chapter de 
klerk told a news conference there can no longer be any doubt 
about the governments sincerity in seeking to create a just 
dispensation based on negotiations 
six antiapartheid activists conferred with mandela about 
logistics of the release and told reporters the 71yearold black 
leader along with his family would ride to freedom in a 
bulletproof mercedesbenz through the gates of victor verster 
prison farm outside cape town 
de klerk said he met with mandela friday night and was convinced 
the prisoner jailed for helping launch the african national 
congress guerrilla campaign was committed to a peaceful 
solution 
the government released a photograph of the two leaders at their 
meeting the first picture of mandela made available to the public 
since the 1960s he is shown next to de klerk hands folded in 
front a big smile on his wrinkled face 
mandelas freedom has been a longstanding demand of black 
leaders in south africa as well as governments and human rights 
groups abroad and the decision drew immediate international praise 
in johannesburg and its main black township soweto blacks 
thronged the streets in celebration 
our leader is coming shouted an excited black youth in 
johannesburg amidst a din of freedom songs and car horns other 
blacks jogged through major thoroughfares holding aloft newspapers 
with the huge headline hes free 
archbishop desmond tutu did a jig on the street in soweto 
mandelas hometown and declared these are incredible days in 
which we are living outside the small brick home mandelas 
family has rented 40 years women and children sang in zulu 
come come come mandela 
but in kathlehong another township near johannesburg police 
said five blacks were killed and 45 injured after officers used 
tear gas and birdshot to disperse a crowd of antiapartheid 
protesters the rally began shortly before the announcement of 
mandelas release police would give no further details 
the south african press association an independent domestic 
news agency quoted mandela as saying in a recent interview that he 
sought to promote unity between blacks and whites 
whites fear the reality of democracy he was quoted as 
saying we must work towards a common destiny and that can only 
be achieved through a nonracial society and not one in which 
whites continue to demand special political treatment 
the news agency did not specify when the interview was conducted 
or how it was arranged mandela is not known to have received any 
journalists as visitors 
president bush said mandelas release would be a significant 
step away from apartheid british prime minister margaret 
thatcher congratulated de klerk for a wise decision and said 
the time had come to resume contacts with south africas isolated 
government 
its a great victory for our people said james stuart a 
member of the ancs executive committee i can hardly believe 
it 
but in the capital pretoria hundreds of extreme rightwingers 
yelling hang mandela marched through the streets with swastika 
flags to demand the overthrow of de klerks government 
de klerk who stunned south africans on feb 2 by lifting a 
30year ban on the anc said mandela would be freed unconditionally 
at 3 pm 8 am est sunday at the gates of victor verster prison 
bulelani ngcuka one of the activists who met mandela late 
saturday said police had expressed concern about his safety 
we thanked them but said the security of comrade mandela is 
our own affair ngcuka said we will do all in our power to 
protect him 
they said mandela would make a statement to the press and give 
an address from the balcony of cape towns city hall 
at his news conference de klerk also said the 3yearold state 
of emergency could be lifted soon if there was no upsurge of 
unrest he expressed willingness to negotiate the possible release 
of remaining political prisoners 
mandela in recent talks with the government had demanded 
freedom for all political prisoners and an end to the state of 
emergency 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for helping plan the start of the ancs guerrilla 
campaign many south african blacks consider him their paramount 
leader and he would be a favorite to win the presidency if blacks 
were allowed to vote 
under south africas system of apartheid the 28 million blacks 
have no vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the 
economy and maintain separate districts schools and health 
services 
the rev jesse jackson on a 12day visit to south africa said 
he welcomed de klerks bold and courageous acts but urged 
nations to maintain pressure on the government until all 
segregation laws are abolished 
mandela is out of jail but not free he said not free to 
move to the neighborhood of his choice not free to send his 
grandchildren to the school of his choice not free to vote not 
free to run for office in his own country 
there was no immediate comment from mandelas wife winnie who 
left the family home in soweto shortly before the announcement was 
made she smiled broadly as her car drove away 
 
de klerk in his historic speech feb 2 lifted bans and 
restrictions on dozens of opposition groups scrapped some 
stateofemergency regulations declared a moratorium on hangings 
and promised to free mandela unconditionally 
de klerks predecessor pw botha had offered to free mandela 
in exchange for a public renunciation of violence mandela refused 
saying the burden was on the government to legalize the anc scrap 
segregation laws and agree to political negotiations 
asked if mandela had now repudiated violence de klerk said the 
black leader would be able to speak for himself sunday 
de klerk who succeeded botha in august has proposed 
negotiations with black leaders on a new constitution that would 
extend political rights to the disenfranchised black majority 
the government is committed to bringing about through 
negotiation a new constitution which is fair and just for all the 
people of south africa de klerk said i hope that now that 
this chapter has ended the world and more especially the people of 
south africa will grasp the opportunity and play whatever 
supportive role can be played toward a peaceful conclusion 
asked whether mandelas release along with the earlier 
concessions would bring about an end to western sanctions against 
south africa de klerk replied we are not working against 
checklists we are doing what we believe is in the best interests 
of south africa 
the government has expressed fears about mandelas safety in 
light of reported death threats from right and leftwing 
extremists de klerk said the matter of security was being 
discussed with mandelas colleagues but added when he is 
released he becomes a free man he doesnt owe it to me to inform 
me about his program 
mandela quartered at a comfortable house at victor verster for 
more than a year has been meeting regularly with a wide range of 
government officials and antiapartheid activists in recent months 
the government has indicated it would accept his offer to serve 
as mediator if talks with the anc take place 
concessions announced by de klerk in his speech met most of the 
ancs conditions for negotiations the organization says de klerk 
still must lift the state of emergency and free all political 
prisoners including those convicted of violent acts 
in his feb 2 speech de klerk lifted longterm bans on the 
south african communist party and on the pan africanist congress a 
guerrilla movement smaller than the anc and less open to a role for 
whites in the liberation struggle 
a senior pan africanist leader barney desai on saturday became 
the first longterm political exile to return to south africa in 
the wake of de klerks announcement desai 57 went into exile in 
1962 while facing prosecution for defying restrictions placed on 
him by police

the head of a proarab french lobbying 
group who helped persuade guerrillas to release two french children 
in 1988 arrived saturday amid speculation he was on a new mediation 
mission 
lucien bitterlin drove to moslem west beirut from damascus 
capital of neighboring syria to meet defense minister albert 
mansour information minister edmond rizk and army commander gen 
emile lahoud at a beachside hotel 
bitterlin a former gaullist member of parliament who leads the 
francoarab solidarity association refused to talk to reporters 
about why he was in beirut 
but his arrival raised speculation that he was seeking to secure 
the release of french and belgian captives held by a radical 
palestinian guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind abu nidal 
bitterlin negotiated the dec 29 1988 release of marielaure 
valente then age 7 and her sister virginie then age 6 from 13 
months of the captivity with abu nidals fatahrevolutionary 
council faction 
the libyanbacked guerrillas still are holding the childrens 
mother jacqueline valente and a baby daughter born in captivity 
as well as five belgians 
they were taken captive nov 8 1987 when the silco an old 
sardine trawler was seized off the israelioccupied gaza strip by 
abu nidals guerrillas 
there have been reports that the boat was in fact seized off 
libya adding to the mystery that has surrounded the plight of the 
captives since they disappeared 
the abu nidal group claims the adults are agents of mossad 
israels intelligence service and have made valuable 
confessions 
the girls freedom was widely viewed as an effort by libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi to boost his image at a time when the 
us government alleging libya was building a chemical weapons 
plant threatened to launch a military strike 
gadhafi called for the girls release during christmas 1988 
the fatahrevolutionary council has been blamed for scores of 
terrorist acts including the december 1985 attacks on rome and 
vienna airports that killed more than 20 people the september 1986 
attack on an istanbul synagogue that killed 21 worshipers and the 
1983 midair bombing of a gulf air jetliner that killed all 122 
people aboard 
the case is considered unrelated to the 18 westerners held 
hostage in lebanon by proiranian factions they include eight 
americans the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped on march 
16 1985

west german chancellor helmut kohl said saturday 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev promised to respect 
german reunification and he declared it a very good day for 
germany 
kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher also disclosed 
that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the four 
victorious world war ii allies to be ready this year to present to 
a paneuropean summit meeting 
at a news conference following 2hours of talks with gorbachev 
kohl gave a glowing assessment of relations with the soviet union 
and the kremlins attitude toward the accelerating developments 
between east and west germany 
kohl said he acknowledged in his talk with gorbachev that de 
facto reunification is occurring faster than anyone expected and 
said the two germanies along with the allies must work out a 
program for controlling it 
gorbachev agreed that the decision on reunification is the 
sole right of the german people including the time frame and the 
method kohl said 
the official soviet news agency tass carried a report on the 
gorbachevkohl meeting that supported kohls assessment 
kohl said the world war ii allies the united states britain 
france and the soviet union should be consulted in reunification 
planning 
this should happen between the two german governments but 
not behind the backs of the four powers the chancellor said 
at the end of this year there would be an opportunity within a 
summitlevel european conference to discuss and announce these 
results kohl said the soviets had previously suggested such a 
meeting 
general secretary gorbachev told me unequivocally that the 
soviet union will respect the decision of germans to live in one 
state kohl said this is a very good day for germany and a 
happy day for me personally 
kohl and soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
indicated that a clear promise to respect the current boundaries 
outlining east germany and west germany also would be contained in 
a reunification plan 
kohl was received in the kremlin for an evening of negotiations 
with gorbachev who is trying to cut soviet losses from the 
democratic revolution that has drawn east germany away from the 
warsaw pact 
gorbachevs acknowledgment nearly two weeks ago that german 
unification was inevitable set off a chain reaction of events that 
have stepped up the movement toward a single germany 
tass commented in a report on the kohlgorbachev meeting that a 
new political situation has evolved in central europe and the two 
german states determine its nature in many respects 
the soviets face potentially major losses in military and 
economic cooperation if east germany joins with the rich west 
german nation now part of the nato alliance 
kohl on a twoweek diplomatic sweep to forge a unity plan 
acceptable to both east and west brought with him an offer of 132 
million in aid for soviet food purchases apparently to demonstrate 
that germany will help restore the economic losses from redirected 
east german trade 
east germany has suffered a severe economic decline in recent 
months as an exodus to west germany increasingly claims its best 
workers and precludes independent efforts at recovery 
as many as 3000 east germans flee the uncertainty in their 
homeland each day and some west german officials fear imminent 
collapse 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told reporters 
before the west german officials arrived that the kremlin sought 
assurances that a reunited germany would recognize current borders 
and never rise as a threat to its european neighbors 
both west germany and east germany are bound by treaties to 
respect the current borders of europe but a united germany is not 
committed to those terms 
conservatives in west germany have suggested that reunification 
should be sought within the 1937 borders which include areas in 
the soviet union as well as nearly a third of presentday poland 
shevardnadze called the border issue the most relevant issue 
to be resolved in the reunification process shevardnadze and 
genscher held their own talks before joining gorbachev and kohl 
the soviets also have pressed for a neutral germany in the event 
the two states are united a condition rejected by bonn as well as 
nato 
while soviet approval and that of the other victor powers would 
be needed to transfer control of berlin to a united germany the 
kremlin has little clout in determining the political shape of the 
reunited state 
last years prodemocracy uprisings throughout eastern europe 
have weakened the economic and defense bonds with the oncedominant 
soviet union and the potential loss of east germany would deal the 
kremlin its most harmful blow 
twothirds of the soviets 575000 europeanbased troops are 
deployed in east germany which is also the most important allied 
trading partner for the economically troubled soviets 
kohl returns to bonn for meetings with east german premier hans 
modrow on tuesday and wednesday when the west germans plans for 
economic integration with east germany will again be the primary 
topic of discussion 
kohl will see french president francois mitterrand after his 
talks with modrow then travel to camp david to meet with president 
bush 
east germans on march 18 vote in their firstever free 
elections and kohl has said he will negotiate the details of 
reunification only with the new elected leadership

jordan has asked the soviet union to halt 
jewish emigration to israel until the palestinian issue is 
resolved prime minister mudar badran said saturday 
badran speaking to the associated press during a break in a 
parliament session said jordan made it clear that if this 
immigration was to be to the israelioccupied territories it means 
that we started practical steps toward crushing all future peace 
chances 
he did not say how the jordanian request to the soviet union was 
made 
israeli officials have said they expect 300000 soviet jews to 
immigrate to israel over the next few years israels prime 
minister yitzhak shamir aroused anger in arab countries two weeks 
ago when he said israel should hold onto the west bank and gaza 
strip to handle an influx of immigrants 
palestinians are fighting for their own state in the 
territories which israel captured from egypt and jordan in the 
1967 middle east war 
badran praised a recent soviet proposal to discuss such 
emigration before the un security council 
we welcome such a move he said 
but he criticized israeli efforts to open direct flights from 
the soviet union to israel a plan that has been stalled due to 
the controversy over immigration to the occupied territories 
this is a roadblock in the way of peace the whole idea of the 
jewish exodus is a roadblock and it will not achieve any steps 
toward a settlement badran said 
the premier repeated a call for an arab delegation to tour the 
united states the soviet union and east european countries to 
explain the dangers of the soviet jewish exodus for the middle east 
peace process 
information minister ibrahim izzeddine said jordan should urge 
the united states to announce that israeli settlements would not 
be set up in the occupied territories and to cut all funds to 
israel if it israel wanted to finance those settlements there 
israel has appealed for foreign donations to help finance 
immigrant settlement but us officials have said no american 
government funds can be used for settlements in the territories 
about half of jordans 31 million people come from palestinian 
families who fled their homes during arabisraeli wars 
jordanian officials say they fear israel will again expel 
hundreds of thousands of palestinians from the occupied territories 
to make way for the immigrants 
in oman the emir of kuwait sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
arrived in muscat on saturday for three days of consultations with 
omans sultan qaboos 
official sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
immigration of soviet jews to israel was one of the top issues for 
their talks 
qaboos is the chairman of the sixnation gulf cooperation 
council which also includes kuwait saudi arabia bahrain qatar 
and the united arab emirates 
jaber is the chairman of the 46member organization of islamic 
conference an umbrella organization for the worlds estimated 1 
billion moslems 
in a recent message he castigated the soviet union and the 
united states for allowing the jewish immigration to israel

an 18yearold told his twin brother that 
they would not be taken alive during a standoff in which they held 
a sheriff hostage in a courthouse before they died in a 
murdersuicide 
in a tape recording made by one of the brothers during the last 
few minutes of the standoff and played by authorities at a news 
conference saturday brad jordan is heard making the comment to his 
brother chad 
they can come in and barge in or whatever they want im going 
to pull that trigger before anybody gets a chance brad jordan 
said 
his words were followed by screams and the sound of two gunshots 
at one point the twins had demanded an oxygen tank and tried to 
use it to create a diversion to help them escape county prosecutor 
james mayer said 
the purpose for the oxygen tank was they wanted to fashion a 
homemade bomb out of a tank that the emergency squad brought along 
with them he said i guess it was their intention to throw 
that out in the hall and distract the officers in the hall and try 
to shoot their way out of jail 
in a separate interview saturday the twins mother said they 
had been in and out of trouble all their lives 
sandra teeters spoke with her sons by telephone during their 
sevenhour standoff friday at the richland county courthouse where 
the two had been taken for questioning about a string of recent 
burglaries 
all they said to me was they wanted out they said they either 
wanted freedom or they were going out in body bags she said in 
an interview 
sheriffs deputy deb strine was questioning the twins chad and 
brad jordan when they overpowered her took her 9mm pistol locked 
themselves in a suite of offices and held her hostage 
sheriff dale shetler later exchanged himself for ms strine 
the standoff ended when brad jordan killed his brother then 
turned the weapon on himself shetler was uninjured 
mrs teeters said the twins the youngest of her seven children 
had been problems since they were in kindergarten 
it was just little things they kicked their teachers they 
actually got put out of kindergarten she said it just kept 
going that way mostly though they were just hyper and never 
really hurt anyone they always wanted attention 
the brothers were charged in a recent string of burglaries in 
northcentral and northeast ohio they were arrested in january 
after a clerk at a convenience store triggered a silent alarm 
during a robbery 
authorities said the burglaries began after the twins were 
released last fall from juvenile custody 
mrs teeters said she had sought professional help for the twins 
and had nothing to show for it but doctor bills 
what all the doctors have told me they just pass it off 
as them being premature babies you figure it out she said 
mrs teeters said the county children services board took 
custody of the twins when they were 13 or 14 mostly because they 
were runaways and placed them in a succession of mental and 
juveniledetention centers

senators of both parties on saturday hailed 
the plan to free black leader nelson mandela from a south african 
prison and called on both sides in that strifetorn nation to begin 
meaningful negotiations 
its the right move senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan said now comes the real test for south africa will 
there be peace as meaningful negotiations move forward lets hope 
so 
the comment came in a statement released by doles office after 
south african president fw de klerk announced that the african 
national congress leader would be freed sunday after 27 years 
de klerk also said the state of emergency under which freedoms 
have been suspended in south africa could be lifted within weeks if 
conditions of stability prevail across the country following 
mandelas release 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chief senate sponsor of 
legislation to impose sanctions on south africa said in a 
statement that freedom for nelson mandela means that freedom is 
closer for all the people of south africa 
his unjust imprisonment has long been the symbol of the 
cruelty and injustice of the racist system of apartheid kennedy 
said 
he expressed hope that todays historic development marks the 
beginning of a genuine commitment by president de klerk and his 
government to dismantle all aspects of apartheid as soon as 
possible 
sen paul simon dill said in a telephone interview that the 
release of mandela along with de klerks other remarks were 
welcome and significant 
it is significant because without this there could be no real 
negotiations and when you couple this with president de klerks 
statement that within a few weeks hes going to completely lift the 
state of emergency you have the conditions for a successful 
resolution of all this he said 
sanctions against south africa imposed by the united states and 
european countries were credited in large part for the change in 
course on the part of the south african government 
the us sanctions imposed in 1986 barred new american 
investment in south africa including bank loans to the government 
prohibited the import of south african iron steel coal uranium 
and agricultural products including sugar prevented the united 
states from exporting computers to south africa banned all nuclear 
trade and halted landings by south african airways 
the chairman of the congressional black caucus rep ron 
dellums dcalif said that the united states should continue to 
use the moral and economic lever of even more stringent sanctions 
as a vehicle for helping to accelerate and expedite the end of 
apartheid in a nonviolent context 
while i welcome the release of nelson mandela from almost 
three decades of imprisonment for his political beliefs i am 
concerned that no mention has been made about the release of more 
than 2000 other black south africans still in prison because of 
their struggle to end apartheid dellums said 
rep connie morella rmd who recently traveled to south 
africa issued a statement calling the release of mandela a major 
step forward for president de klerk and one indication that the 
winds of democracy that have swept across europe may be reaching 
south africa 
however before sanctions are relaxed or eliminated several 
additional steps must be taken she said these include release 
of the many remaining political prisoners lifting of the state of 
emergency and removal of troops from the townships 
new york mayor david n dinkins said mandela could have been 
released a long time ago if he had compromised his principles 
he is an inspiration to all those seeking freedom who will not 
compromise and i look forward to his unconditional release and the 
day all south africans will be free dinkins said 
just because we freed one man doesnt mean we freed an entire 
nation said rep william h gray iii dpa the house majority 
whip and author of legislation imposing us sanctions against 
south africa 
rep john lewis dga said mandelas release marked a 
significant step toward peaceful political change in the country 
however lewis a former activist in the us civil rights 
movement also urged political leaders here to continue to apply 
pressure on the south africa government in the form of economic 
sanctions 
randall robinson leader of the washingtonbased antiapartheid 
group transafrica said pressure from the united states and europe 
produced the release of mandela he described it as a tiny step 
political prisoners must still be released parliament must 
repeal apartheid laws and until these things are done it is too 
early to evaluate the good faith of president de klerk he said 
this is only the release of one great man he said 
sen jesse helms rnc and a leading conservative was not 
planning a comment on the development an aide said dole was the 
only republican with a comment despite calls to spokesmen for 
several prominent gop members of congress

a human rights group said in a report 
published sunday that iraq uses torture and execution to silence 
the opposition and it called on the united states to impose 
sanctions to end the alleged practices 
middle east watch a branch of the new yorkbased human rights 
watch said iraqis face forced relocation and deportation 
arbitrary arrest and detention torture disappearance and summary 
and political execution 
there is no meaningful legal recourse in iraq against these 
abuses it said 
large numbers of persons have unquestionably died under 
torture in iraq over the past two decades middle east watch 
said it did not give specific figures 
president saddam hussein was quoted last month by visiting arab 
legislators as saying that iraq soon will have a new constitution 
that will provide for greater press freedom and allow the formation 
of new political parties 
middle east watch said its report is based on interviews with 
iraqis government and intelligence officials scholars 
journalists and other reports it said its investigators were not 
allowed to visit iraq 
the investigators said that an extraordinary cult of personality 
around saddam is part of the repressive system 
saddam is president of the allpowerful revolutionary command 
council and secretarygeneral of the ruling baath socialist party 
as well as president and prime minister 
according to emigre testimony even spilling coffee on the 
picture of saddam hussein that appears daily on the front page of 
the newspapers has been known to lead to arrest and 
interrogation the report said 
it repeated charges confirmed by the united nations and the 
united states that iraq used chemical weapons against its 
rebellious kurdish population in 1988 
iraq also razed thousands of villages to relocate kurds and 
create a 19milewide buffer zone along 750 miles of border with 
iran and turkey the report noted at least 500000 of iraqs 35 
million kurds were forcibly dislocated it said 
the report accused presidents bush and ronald reagan of putting 
the nurturing of newly friendly relations with saddam husseins 
government well ahead of the violent and repressive nature of his 
regime 
washington is reluctant to risk a break with baghdad because of 
iraqs enormous oil wealth and the prospect of lucrative 
trade the report said

an emerging chemical weapons accord and 
significant progress on arms control marked a mostly successful 
marathon negotiating mission here by secretary of state james a 
baker iii that wound up saturday with an unprecedented live debate 
with soviet legislators 
the net result before baker flew off to sofia for talks with 
government and opposition forces in bulgaria an east european 
country in a rocky transition from hard line communism is that 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev can 
anticipate signing possibly two accords to curb chemical and 
nuclear weapons when they meet at the summit in washington in june 
in an exceptionally glowing joint statement issued before 
bakers departure the superpowers stressed that while certain 
significant differences remain between them the relationship 
is increasingly marked by understanding cooperation and the 
search for mutual advantage 
the evidence was striking during the four days of talks baker 
held with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and a long 
session friday with gorbachev who was still savoring his historic 
victory within the communist party 
at gorbachevs behest the central committee agreed to revoke 
the partys monopoly on political power and set the stage for 
political competition that might have gorbachev running for 
reelection as president 
surprisingly gorbachev told reporters lets wait and see 
when they asked whether he would make such a race as a communist 
the most significant result of the negotiations was an 
unexpected breakthrough on sealaunched cruise missiles the most 
difficult in a handful of knotty problems standing in the way of a 
treaty to reduce us and soviet longrange nuclear missiles 
bombers and submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent 
baker and the soviets agreed to take the cruise missiles out of 
the strategic weapons treaty that the two sides hope to sign at the 
june summit meeting instead the cruise missiles will be dealt 
with in a separate side statement that evidently will not be 
submitted along with the treaty to the senate for ratification 
for the first time baker openly acknowledged there is no sure 
way to verify how many of the weapons carried by submarines and 
surface fighting ships the other side has on board 
he did not disclose what the statements would contain but 
separating the issue from the treaty is likely to improve the 
prospects for a june signing ceremony at the white house 
after years of handwringing and stopstart negotiating efforts 
meanwhile baker and the soviets worked out a formula for 
destroying us and soviet chemical weapons stocks 
the emerging agreement also slated for a summit signing 
provides for substantial reductions over eight years in stocks of 
us and soviet poison gas to be followed by the elimination of 
all chemical weapons provided that dozens of other nations 
negotiating in geneva agree to abolish their stockpiles as well 
the outcome was a diplomatic triumph for the bush administration 
when the president advanced his proposal last year the soviets 
questioned the us determination to retain 2 percent of the deadly 
weapons until all nations capable of producing them signed the 
international accord 
the joint statement indicated the soviets had accepted bushs 
formula 
there also was marked progress toward a third arms control 
agreement gorbachev countered bushs state of the union proposal 
for a ceiling of 195000 us and soviet troops in central europe 
with a suggestion that the ceiling be extended to superpower forces 
on foreign soil throughout europe 
this would mean withdrawing the 30000 american soldiers that 
bushs initiative would leave in britain greece italy spain and 
turkey 
alternatively gorbachev said he would go along with bushs 
overall european ceiling of 225000 troops this would give the 
soviets leeway to have 225000 soldiers in central europe where 
most of the red army is based 
baker called gorbachevs approach very close to the 
presidents proposal but delayed a response until he meets with 
the foreign ministers of the 15 north atlantic treaty organization 
allies in ottawa canada on monday and tuesday 
even on a technical level the us arms control agenda moved 
ahead 
agreement was reached for a full disclosure of data from 
strategic missile tests and to set a ceiling on us and soviet 
landbased mobile missiles that will be kept in storage under the 
emerging strategic weapons limitation treaty 
also the two sides decided on limiting the cruise missiles 
carried by their bombers but could not agree on how to restrict 
the range of the missiles carried on the bombers 
on the other hand baker clashed with the soviets over the 
ongoing delivery of latemodel mig29 fighter bombers to cuba he 
acknowledged he could not persuade gorbachev and shevardnadze to 
keep the weapons out of president fidel castros hands 
baker concluded his visit with a 90minute appearance before the 
international affairs committee of the supreme soviet he is the 
first us official to appear before the legislative body an event 
he attributed to gorbachevs policy of openness 
 
baker then flew to sofia for separate meetings with government 
and opposition leaders he has criticized the country for the slow 
pace of its reform but prime minister andrei lukanov told 
reporters we are prepared to accept without any hesitation the 
wishes of the people 
lukanov appealed an expansion of us trade which now consists 
primarily of bulgaria shipping wine and tobacco to the united 
states in exchange for grain 
lukanov said the government was open for a dialogue with all 
political forces i mean it 
baker met first with the government leaders and urged them to 
conduct a free and fair election a senior us official said 
he also stressed the importance of not forcing the assimilation 
of ethnic turks who past regimes were charged compelling to adopt 
bulgarian names and to abandon their cultural and moslem religious 
practices 
the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
said baker stressed that the credibility of the government 
depends on how the elections are carried out 
then meeting with 17 members of the union of democratic forces 
an opposition coalition baker heard stories of political 
imprisonment in prior years and difficulty in preparing for the 
election because of newsprint shortages and problems in getting 
organizing throughout the country 
you can win if you stay united baker said he told 
reporters later the administration was reserving judgment in 
the contest 
on sunday baker flies to bucharest for a slightly longer than 
fourhour visit to the romanian capital 
in his appearance before the soviet legislators baker spoke 
from a podium with a marble bust of lenin peering over his shoulder 
and borrowed the title of the arthur koestler novel in recalling 
the darkness at noon that preceded gorbachevs rise to power in 
1985 
today we see reason return baker said today i come 
before the founding fathers of a new soviet union a new soviet 
union you are building 
but he then lectured the soviets against spending badly needed 
resources supporting marxist governments in cuba nicaragua angola 
and cambodia 
baker contrasted that activity with gorbachevs policy of 
noninterference in europe where the soviet leaders actions 
have played a vital role in supporting the creation of legitimate 
governments 
on the other hand baker said we remain especially disturbed 
by the military shipments your government continues to send to 
those seeking military solutions to conflicts in regions vital to 
us 
he added this is even less comprehensible when it happens at 
a time when your people clearly need those scarce resources put to 
good use at home 
several of the legislators responded in a questionandanswer 
session with attacks on the bush administrations refusal to engage 
in naval disarmament talks and to halt nuclear weapons tests they 
also criticized the invasion of panama 
gen sergei akhromeyev gorbachevs military adviser questioned 
the modest reductions in us military spending in contrast to what 
he said was a 14 percent slash in soviet spending and he said the 
united states had not dismantled dozens of military bases that have 
surrounded the soviet union for 45 years 
baker defended the panama invasion as a unique us use of force 
to remove gen manuel antonio noriega whom baker called a thug

virginia democratic leaders said saturday 
they have no candidate to oppose us sen john w warner after 
they spurned a supporter of political extremist lyndon larouche who 
offered to run as a democrat 
paul goldman chairman of the state democratic party and a close 
adviser to gov l douglas wilder said no democrat has expressed 
an interest in running against warner and the party will not hold a 
state convention this year unless someone steps forward by march 15 
warner 62 is in his second term and is the highest ranking 
republican on the powerful armed services committee 
no one says hes doing a fine job goldman said after about 
100 democratic leaders gathered at the marriott hotel for a 
democratic state central committee meeting id love to have a 
candidate to run against him 
the meeting was interrupted briefly by several supporters of 
larouche a former fringe presidential candidate sentenced to 15 
years in prison for conspiracy and mail fraud 
nancy spannaus a larouche supporter who wants to run against 
warner as a democrat was prevented from speaking at the meeting 
i have a democratic program ms spannaus said as party 
regulars shouted no and get her out of here 
alan ogden a larouche activist accused the democrats of 
tacitly supporting warner and president bush by refusing to run a 
candidate 
this is not the communist party ogden shouted 
ogden was escorted from the meeting by hotel employees 
state central committee members adopted rules that would make it 
virtually impossible for ms spannaus to win the democratic 
nomination under the rules any candidate who wants to run must 
win the support of 20 percent of the delegates picked at local 
caucus meetings for a convention to be held 
caucuses are to be held in the spring goldman said a convention 
would be held june 9 if a credible candidate steps forward 
were not going to foreclose anything at this juncture he 
said 
goldman said a strong current of pragmatism among party 
members has made them reluctant to run a token candidate against 
warner 
if someone just wants to run for the exercise they ought to 
enter their local marathon he said thats the sentiment im 
finding 
it would be the first time this century that state democrats 
have not run a senate candidate last year the party swept the top 
three state offices in an election that made wilder the nations 
first elected black governor 
the democrats strongest candidate would have been former gov 
gerald l baliles but he said last year he did not want to run 
warner announced his reelection bid monday he said saturday he 
plans to campaign regardless of democratic plans 
if the democratic party elects not to endorse a candidate i 
will accept that decision with humility warner said

about 600 blacks marched to the mayors house 
saturday and demonstrators continued sitins at selma high school 
and city hall to protest alleged police brutality and a black 
school superintendents dismissal 
protesters had planned to walk from a selma church to the edmund 
pettus bridge a landmark in the civil rights movement of 25 years 
ago but organizers postponed that walk until sunday 
the protests have kept all of selma schools closed since 
wednesday sitins have been held at the high school and city hall 
since thursday 
city attorneys friday asked us district judge charles butler 
of mobile to issue a temporary restraining order against the 
sitins butler scheduled a telephone conference with attorneys for 
monday when schools were scheduled to reopen 
the protesters lawyer jl chestnut said the judge told me 
he recognized constitutional rights to exercise free speech and was 
reluctant for the federal courts to step in but that he was also 
dutybound to deal with any excesses 
protesters said they would not give up 
marchers were led to mayor joe smithermans home by the rev 
joseph lowery president of the southern christian leadership 
conference the marchers prayed for the white mayor whose tenure 
stretches back to 1965 
smitherman did not appear for marchers who walked on to the 
home of a black county commissioner and a shopping center 
police made no arrests during the march or saturdays round of 
sitins 
we are wrapped in a sacred flag of history today lowery 
said at the start of the march 
the racial turmoil began when six white members of the school 
board voted last week against extending the contract of norward 
roussell the citys first black superintendent that ignited 
protests leading to the closing of two schools tuesday and all 11 
of selmas public schools wednesday 
roussell was reinstated after the initial protests but students 
and other protesters want the school board to extend his contract 
which expires this year 
four blacks protesting the dismissal of roussell were arrested 
monday during a melee at smithermans office 
rose sanders a selma attorney said she was the victim of 
police brutality during the melee a preliminary city report said 
allegations of police brutality at the protest were unfounded 
lowery told marchers saturday the issue here while we have 
to deal with police brutality is unequal education we must 
bring down the walls of unequal education in the 90s as we brought 
down the walls of disenfranchisement in the 60s

a wealthy landowner was 
convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison saturday for killing 
a farm workers leader he blamed for disputes over his property in 
a southern state 
the chiapas state court said in a statement that roberto zenteno 
rojas was guilty of the december 1988 shooting of sebastian perez 
nunez a former state legislator who led the independent center of 
agricultural workers and campesinos 
zenteno blamed perez nunez for disputes over his land peasants 
had been occupying 120 acres of zentenos 740acre ranch since 
august 1988 demanding it be turned over to them 
under mexicos agrarian reform law which has given land to 
millions of landless peasants the government may take over land 
holdings that are larger than legal limits or left idle and turn 
them into ejidos a type of communal farm 
personal disputes and vendettas over land rights are common in 
chiapas mexicos southernmost state bordering guatemala where 
hundreds of peasants have been killed in recent years over such 
disputes 
witnesses said zenteno shot perez nunez 13 times on dec 29

organization said after the conviction that his organization 
trusted the criminal justice system but that he was skill 
skeptical about the governments commitment to carrying out land 
reform 
roberto zenteno had a lot of money not only him but all of 
the big landowners who came to his defense nunez said 
perez nunez widow and the family of zenteno could not be 
reached immediately for comment on the conviction

us rep james courter a longtime abortion 
opponent who lost the new jersey governors race last year has 
changed his mind and supports a womans right to abortion a 
spokesman said saturday 
as excruciating as it is for an individual thats trying to 
make up her mind thats how excrutiating it was for him said 
bob friant a legislative aide its not easy to stand up and 
say hey im changing my mind 
courter who was soundly defeated by gov jim florio in the 
november election began the campaign assuring voters he would 
continue my prolife efforts and oppose abortion except in the 
case of rape incest or a threat to the mothers life 
later as it became apparent new jerseyites widely favored a 
prochoice position he softened his stance and said he would do 
nothing to restrict womens right to abortions 
the day after his loss to florio courter said he would 
reconsider his position on abortion he is now stating he will 
vote prochoice on all relevant legislation friant said 
although courter remains personally opposed to abortion friant 
said he has concluded government should not make personal moral 
or religious decisions for people 
when he was running for governor he was exposed to a lot of 
individuals who asked him to reconsider his position and made 
some very persuasive arguments friant said he began to 
realize that perhaps this is not a decision that government should 
impose on women 
were glad to be able to count him in the prochoice side 
said fran avallone state coordinator of right to choose i think 
the election in new jersey made it clear to a lot of people that 
the prochoice position is the majority position 
emma byrne florios spokeswoman said the governor had no 
comment on the report 
richard traynor president of the new jersey right to life 
committee said courters new position was consistent with his 
backpeddling during the campaign the committee initially 
backed courter but withdrew its support 
courter who represents the 12th congressional district is 
running for reelection but doubts abortion will be a major issue 
in the campaign

robbers shot seven people in a bowling 
alley office saturday killing a man his two young daughters and 
another girl before setting a fire to try to cover up the crime 
police said 
what we have here is a very vicious crime the assassination 
of kids said las cruces police capt fred rubio a whole 
family was assassinated 
the three survivors and residents living near the las cruces 
bowl lanes gave police a description of two men believed to have 
committed the robbery and shootings 
rubio said officers were looking for two hispanic men one 
described as about 5foot11 with short kinky hair and in his 30s 
the other as 5foot6 dark heavyset and in his late 40s or early 
50s 
officers were manning 10 roadblocks into and out of this city of 
about 55000 people located 45 miles north of the mexico border a 
helicopter was being used and 80 percent of the police departments 
criminal investigation staff was working on the case rubio said 
rubio identified the dead as steve turan a bowling alley worker 
believed to be in his 30s and daughters paula turan 7 and 
victoria turan 2 and another girl amy houser 13 
he said victoria was alive when the victims were found but was 
pronounced dead on arrival at memorial general hospital 
the three survivors were taken to the hospital where they were 
in critical condition rubio said he refused to release their 
names citing security reasons and concern for their safety he 
said one was 12 one was 30 and the third was in his or her 30s 
the police captain said a fire was reported at the bowling alley 
at 833 am a halfhour after it opened 
firefighters found the seven victims in the office 
according to our preliminary investigation they were rounded 
up and taken into that particular office rubio said they were 
concentrated in one area and shot in one area 
the robbers then started a fire in the office it appears it 
was to cover up the crime scene he said 
rubio said the apparent motive was robbery and apparently 
they decided to rid themselves of any witnesses 
youre talking about a 3yearold what could a 3yearold 
testify to this is why i say its the worst he said 
police did not disclose the amount of money taken but rubio 
said 
what makes it even worse is not only the amount of people who 
were shot for the amount of money taken if you start adding up 
all these ages youre going to come up with 100 years of life that 
was just gone by some ignorant people that did this 
authorities said junior league games for youngsters had been 
scheduled to start at the bowling alley at 9 am

the chief executive of the american medical 
association resigned a year before he planned to retire amid 
revelations about moneylosing deals involving ama investments and 
two top staff members 
i am convinced that the ama should focus on the future now and 
not wait until i go as planned dr james h sammons said in a 
news release the ama issued saturday 
sammons 62 who is credited with guiding the association 
through hard financial times over 15 years had his fiscal 
discretion curtailed two months ago by ama trustees who praised 
him on his departure 
the board of trustees said at its interim annual meeting in 
honolulu that sammons had failed to follow routine fiscal policies 
in approving deals between himself and two staff members 
in one deal approved by sammons in 1987 the ama used 
pensionfund investments to reimburse one of the staffers 353000 
for his losses in the stock market crash 
the officer resigned and has since paid back the money sammons 
turned in his resignation friday the ama statement said 
in another deal approved by sammons in 1989 the ama lost 
65000 in a foreclosure settlement on a 267710 loan it had given 
one of sammons assistants to buy a condominium 
the deals were brought to light last fall by the sun times of 
chicago which published more details last week 
the newspaper reported that the ama lost 45000 in the 1984 
purchase of sammons suburban home and sale of the home a year 
later 
the newspaper also described a similar deal in 1980 in which the 
ama bought a home owned by sammons top deputy and later sold it at 
a loss of 23000 
the washington state medical association subsequently called for 
sammons to step aside during an investigation of ama finances 
which the board initiated in october 
the illinois state medical society made an official call for 
such a probe and two other ama affiliates asked that sammons 
powers be limited 
ama trustee dr joseph painter said sammons increased the amas 
assets from 25 million to 193 million helped increase membership 
by 100000 to more than 270000 and expansion the associations 
activities in such areas as medical publishing education science 
and disease prevention 
the board saturday named dr james s todd acting executive vice 
president to replace sammons todd a former chairman of the ama 
board has been the organizations senior deputy vice president for 
five years

they showed him various pictures and other family mementoes and 
although wolf said a few things seemed familiar he was still 
unable to recall who he was 
its a little confusing to him said james caskey 30 he 
said theres no doubt theres some connection with all the pictures 
and the things weve been telling him but he doesnt know us 
saturdays reunion came after other relatives in wisconsin had 
seen a story about him 
selig had developed information that there might be a wisconsin 
connection and reporter russ ptacek of topekas wibwtv called tv 
in that state on thursday to encourage them to use a story he had 
done about the case 
ptacek said that minutes after his story was aired on wititv in 
milwaukee thursday night two people living in wisconsin 
independently called the station and said they were relatives 
ptacek then called selig and police to tell them of the 
developments topeka police said saturday they were still 
investigating the case they were still waiting on a fingerprint 
check 
in recent sessions selig had doe draw things under hypnosis 
including a detailed sketch of what appeared to be a map 
it had no meaning to anyone until saturday when mrs caskey 
looked at it and said it was the layout of the farm in wisconsin 
where she said they grew up 
mrs caskey said that wolf had lived with her and her family in 
angleton where she said he owned an electronics repair store she 
said he left home last aug 20 on a business trip to washington
