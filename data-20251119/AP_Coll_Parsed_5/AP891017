the rev ralph david abernathy hit the airwaves 
tuesday to attack his autobiographys critics questioning the 
motives of those challenging his assertion the rev martin luther 
king jr had extramarital affairs 
abernathy appeared on nbcs today show in the morning and 
the networks donahue program in the afternoon 
black leaders including other former king aides such as jesse 
jackson and andrew young denounced the book last week calling for 
abernathy to repudiate passages about the slain civil rights 
leaders personal life 
abernathy wrote that king had a weakness for women and that he 
had sexual encounters with two women and fought with a third woman 
the night before his 1968 assassination in memphis tenn 
the critics also cited abernathys two recent strokes and 
expressed doubts he wrote the book and the walls came tumbling 
down 
on today the 63yearold atlanta minister said jackson 
was not honest with martin luther king he wanted to fire him 
and i had to suspend him after i became the president of the 
sclc the southern christian leadership conference 
martin was angry with jesse because jesse was always trying to 
upstage and steal some of the glamour away from martin abernathy 
said on donahue 
abernathy said the criticism from his civil rights colleagues 
tells me that most of the black leaders in this country are not 
concerned about the movement the poor people the downtrodden 
abernathy suggested youngs motive for criticizing the book was 
political young the outgoing mayor of atlanta is expected to run 
for governor of georgia 
asked by today host bryant gumbel about three other black 
leaders who have criticized his book naacp executive director 
benjamin hooks and reps john lewis dga and bill gray dpa 
abernathy called them good men 
all of these men that youre saying are good men have 
repudiated the book and have a problem with it said gumbel 
but they have not read the book abernathy replied you 
have to read the book in its entirety 
hooks appeared on donahue with abernathy and disputed 
abernathys account that king had trysts 
i cannot understand to save my life even if it were true how 
he could say it hooks said 
he suggested that abernathys ill health and pressure from 
publisher harper amp row led to the inclusion of the controversial 
material as well as what hooks said were factual mistakes in the 
book 
if ralph had been in control he would have caught those 
errors he said harper amp row has said the words in the book were 
abernathys 
after the show hooks and abernathy embraced laughing and 
chatting 
earlier when donahue asked abernathy about his health 
abernathy got out of his seat waved an arm and snapped his 
fingers i can do anything he said he also gave a rambling 
account of an operation he underwent 
roy innis director of the congress of racial equality appeared 
on donahue to defend abernathy arguing that despite the 
revelations in the book kings stature is still as great 
on today abernathy repeated his contention that he had 
little choice but to write an honest account of kings difficult 
time resisting sexual temptation because previous king historians 
have addressed the subject 
i wanted to make it look like martin luther king jr was 
simply a human being that he was not a god he was not a saint 
but he was a human being a mortal human being subject to make 
mistakes and errors abernathy said

an ohio senator said tuesday he wants a new 
energy department safety oversight board to review the possibility 
that tanks holding radioactive and chemical waste at the hanford 
nuclear reservation could explode 
earlier democratic sen john glenns staff released a 1984 
report which concluded in a worst case the tanks at the reservation 
in southcentral washington state could explode with a force of 36 
tons of tnt and scatter radioactivity widely 
a followup report just months later however essentially 
dismissed the danger of explosion according to a spokesman for the 
lab that prepared both reports 
washington state officials said tuesday that the followup report 
focused on different chemical compounds found in the tanks and that 
the earlier report had some validity 
the energy department is currently studying the tanks and the 
potential for explosions and a spokesman said a report could be 
issued as early as next spring 
the possibility of a tank explosion is a key question as the 
department tries to decide whether to leave the waste in place or 
remove it solidify it and store it elsewhere 
the risk of explosions from these waste tanks has not received 
the attention it deserves said glenn as members of the senate 
armed services committee questioned nominees to the department of 
energy defense nuclear facility safety board we are not just 
dealing with an abstract problem 
glenn said later that the five members of board need to look 
over the shoulder of the department and offer a second 
opinion on environmental safety and health issues 
questions like those about these tanks should not go on year 
after year without being resolved said glenn who sponsored the 
legislation creating the board 
there was no indication from the nominees of what they planned 
to do about the tanks the prspective chairman john t conway 
said the new board would have to look at all nuclear safety issues 
in the nations nuclear weaponsbuilding complex 
a possible explosion in one of the tanks would not be a nuclear 
blast but could spread radioactivty 
the explosion of a similar tank at kyshtym in the soviet union 
in 1957 or 1958 scattered intense radioactivity over an area the 
size of rhode island killing hundreds of people and forcing such 
an extensive resettlement program that 30 villages simply 
disappeared from maps glenn said 
the wastes both chemical and radioactive are byproducts of 
more than 40 years of plutonium production some of the 
singleshell tanks at hanford date back to the manhattan project 
that built the first atomic bomb in world war ii 
there has never been a waste storage tank explosion at hanford 
but doe officals have said there have been burps caused by 
small gas bubbles 
both the 1984 report and the followup report were done by 
battelle northwest laboratories for contractors at the reservation 
according to the 1984 report up to 140 tons of ferrocyanide may 
be contained in old singleshell tanks at the reservation 
the ferrocyanide was added to the liquid waste stream from 1954 
to 1975 to precipitate radioactive cesium and radioactive 
stronitum two metals the report said the goal was to produce 
additional tank storage space by concentrating the waste 
mixed with nitrates and nitrites both of which are in the 
tanks cyanide has been shown to undergo explosive reactions when 
heated the report said 
the report said that under a worstcase scenario the energy 
released from a single waste tank could be equivalent to that of 36 
tons of tnt 
at present there is insufficient information to state that 
the hazard of a potentially violent cyanide reaction does not 
exist the report said 
the report said large amounts of cyanide were placed in at least 
14 of 149 tanks at the reservation with possibly up to 30 tons in 
a single tank 
ken morgan a department spokesman in richland wash said that 
19 tanks contained the cyanide 
the cyanide could be explosive if it reached temperatures higher 
than about 650 degrees fahrenheit the report said morgan said 
current temperature in the tanks is less than 130 degrees 
but morgan said the 1984 report failed to pass peer review a 
process in which it is critiqued by other scientists and was never 
published 
to say that wastes can explode is as useful as saying the 
flour in the kitchen can explode which it can under the right 
conditions morgan said 
gary petersen a battelle spokesman said the second 
peerreviewed report released in june 1985 concluded the chance of 
a potential reaction among the chemicals was nonexistent or 
negligible 
but that report focused on organics in the tanks not 
ferrocyanides battelle spokesman jerry holloway said later in the 
day 
i dont buy it don provost of the washington state 
department of ecology said of the second reports conclusion 
downplaying the possibility of an explosion i think the 1984 
report had some validity

sacks of ammonium bicarbonate an ingredient in baking powder with 
sodium nitrate when unloading cargo from hong kong in april 
the sodium nitrate was sent to the cookie factories by mistake 
and beginning in july ended up in cookies sodium nitrate is used 
in making explosives and fertilizers

it was a typical friars club roast celebrity 
victim bruce willis dais thick with cigar smoke thanks uncle 
miltie air blue with obscene jokes sorry not printable but 
this time for the first time women were permitted to share in the 
fun 
they have caved in to reality surrendered to reality 
they have to enter the 20th century said attorney gloria allred 
whose complaint about the friars nowomen roast policy opened the 
doors tuesday for about two dozen females at the willis affair 
ms allred entered after a brief but nasty exchange with a friar 
who told her youre yesterdays news lady we dont care about 
you ms allred proclaiming sexism is yesterdays news 
walked past him 
i feel it should have been done a long time ago said 
marilyn haft an entertainment lawyer who attended the roast but 
its sexism and it takes time to change sexism 
ms allred arrived at the sheraton centre shortly before the 
noon roast anticipating a fight to get in but other female guests 
already had entered the roasting room preventing a repeat of the 
ernest borgnine affair she was ejected from last year 
the friars founded in 1904 have banned women from their roasts 
with only a few exceptions lucille ball and phyllis diller have 
been roastees never before were women allowed in the audience 
despite the presence of the ladies the roasters promised the 
usual raunchy routines would not be toned down 
after my five minutes bruce will be convicted of a felony 
im sure said comedian rick ducommon he might get a light 
sentence being such a big star but hell be convicted 
the friars seemed to take the new policy in stride even henny 
youngman who engaged in a muchpublicized argument with ms allred 
last year over the clubs lunch policy banning women appeared 
kinder and gentler 
nobody bothers me any more i got money saved said youngman 
comic gilbert gottfried felt the admission of women while a 
good thing would not be personally rewarding 
they could allow millions of women in here and it still 
wouldnt help me said gottfried id still end up going home 
with henny youngman

the san francisco earthquake tuesday was a 
good warning the head of the us geological survey said 
the question is not whether a big earthquake is coming the 
question is when said dallas peck director of the service in 
an interview 
tuesdays quake was not a trivial earthquake but it was not a 
1906 earthquake peck said 
the surveys geologists estimated the magnitude of tuesdays 
tremor at anywhere from 62 to 69 on the richter scale well 
pin that down peck said while the 1906 quake has been 
estimated at up to 83 
tuesdays quake is telling us weve got a lot to learn and to 
do better strenghtening buildings and other structures to 
withstand a major quake peck said 
at present there is no way of warning of a specific quake at a 
specific time but odds can be calculated there was no 
warning of tuesdays peck noted 
in july 1988 a committee of experts convened by the geological 
survey was more worried about southern california than the san 
francisco area 
the committee estimated that a major quake one measuring 70 
on the richter scale had a 50 percent chance of occuring in the 
san francisco area along the san andreas fault the fault involved 
in tuesdays shocks during the next 30 years 
that committee said the chance of such a quake in the following 
10 years was about one in five 
but a repetition of the 1906 quake was given odds of less than 
one in 10 during the next 30 years 
the san andreas fault runs along the western side of san 
francisco bay the hayward fault runs along the eastern side and 
the committee gave the same odds for a quake there 
southern california was seen at more risk 
the committee said there was a 60 percent chance of a 
75magnitude quake along the southern california segments of the 
san andreas fault and a 50 percent chance of one of magnitude 80 
or greater 
elsewhere in southern california the committee put the chance 
of a 65 quake on the imperial fault at 50 percent over 30 years 
and the chance of a 65 to 70 quake on the san jacinto fault near 
san bernardinoriverside at at the same 50 percent during 30 years

prime minister felipe gonzalez the 
socialist who has eased western concerns about where he would lead 
spain after his unexpected landslide victory seven years ago is 
heading for what polls indicate will be an unprecedented third term 
in elections oct 29 
gonzalez a 47yearold former labor lawyer has since led the 
country into an economic boom with policies that upset some of his 
own socialists labor particularly 
he also has brought spain into the european economic community 
and reaffirmed its membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
so far it has been a successful road for gonzalez who once had 
to slip into spain from france in the trunk of a car because his 
party was outlawed by the authoritarian regime of gen francisco 
franco 
according to private and government polls the socialists are 
expected to win at least 40 percent of the vote from the countrys 
295 million registered voters for their third absolute majority in 
the 350seat lower house of parliament they now hold 183 seats 
polls also indicate little on the right or left can block the 
spanish socialist workers party the official name of gonzalezs 
party 
the main opposition group the conservative popular party is in 
disarray having struggled in the past two years for coherence 
under three different leaders 
its current leader and candidate to replace gonzalez is 
36yearold jose maria aznar he took the reins of the party less 
than two months before gonzalez on aug 25 issued the call for 
this election the conservatives now hold 91 lower house seats and 
are campaigning on a platform calling for privatization of state 
industry sharp cuts in public spending and lower taxes 
former prime minister adolfo suarez of the social democratic 
center party is repeating his 1986 attempt to recapture the office 
mainly with a call for the abolition of the 12month obligatory 
military service his party now holds 28 seats in the lower house 
in 1977 two years after francos death the 58yearold suarez 
formed spains first democratically elected government in 41 years 
the socialists response to suarez on the military service issue 
is that they reduced the obligatory service time to the current 12 
from the 18 months that existed during his administration the 
socialists also ask how suarez plans to pay for an allvolunteer 
army 
the united left coalition under julio anguita the 48yearold 
communist and former mayor of cordoba is expected to gain up to 
five seats more than its current seven by picking up the votes of 
socialists disillusioned with the gonzalez government which they 
perceive as having shifted towards the centerright 
their slogan we are the alternative is aimed at members of 
the general workers union the countrys largest and historically 
socialist labor movement the union has not called on its rank and 
file to vote socialist this time claiming that the gonzalez 
government has failed to promote an equitable distribution of 
spains new wealth 
according to the organization for economic cooperation and 
development spains per capita gross domestic product rose from 
4192 in 1984 to 7449 in 1987 the year after spain joined the 
eec and confirmed its membership nato 
its annual growth rate of 5 percent is europes highest 
in the 1982 campaign when gonzalez ran in his first successful 
campaign his antinato stance and populist style made western 
leaders nervous 
in this campaign gonzalez and other socialist leaders maintain 
that opposition parties have failed to come up with serious 
platforms and alternatives 
their exaggerated negativism is a reflection of their 
frustration gonzalez has said they would be better off if 
they tried to come up with alternatives that would appeal to 
voters 
another issue that has upset the opposition is gonzalezs wife 
carmen who is running for parliament on the socialist ticket in 
cadiz 
opposition parties have compared her to eva peron who had an 
exceeding influential role in argentina as the wife of populist 
dictator juan d peron and to imelda marcos the wife of former 
president ferdinand e marcos of the philippines 
gonzalezs only response to those who make the comparisons is 
that they lack democratic sentiment

northern rebels have launched a 
major offensive according to reports reaching the ethiopian 
capital and the guerrilla forces have inflicted defeats on 
government troops 
according to diplomats in addis ababa the rebels have pushed 
government forces back and reached nearly to dese 155 miles from 
the capital 
the reports could not be confirmed but a rebel advance to dese 
would raise a threat of cutting the road between addis ababa and 
the red sea port of assab site of ethiopias only oil refinery and 
one of two key points of entry for tons of emergency relief food 
one african diplomat said president mengistu haile mariams 
forces would have act to halt the rebel advance before it becomes 
serious trouble for the government 
the diplomats interviewed spoke on condition they not be 
identified 
the push southward is by a group calling itself the ethiopian 
peoples revolutionary democratic movement a combined force of the 
tigre peoples liberation front and the ethiopian peoples 
democratic movement 
the liberation front which took up arms in 1974 is pressing 
for increased autonomy for the province of tigre and the overthrow 
of mengistus marxist government the front has an estimated 20000 
troops 
the democratic movement a smaller group split four years ago 
from the radical ethiopian peoples revolutionary party formed 
after the 1974 ouster of the late emperor haile selassie 
the ethiopian army went through a leadership crisis following a 
may 15 coup attempt when troops loyal to mengistu killed at least 
14 generals and the government jailed 100 senior officers 
officers appointed to replace those killed or imprisoned have 
little field experience and apparently have failed to rally the 
support of the troops one african envoy said 
in a speech after the coup mengistu said the rebellious 
generals had lacked patriotism he blamed them for the governments 
repeated recent failures in clashes with the rebels 
he was referring to rebel victories that began with a joint 
offensive in may 1988 by the liberation front and the secessionist 
eritrean peoples liberation front when the rebels captured most of 
tigre and much of eritrea ethiopias northernmost province 
the eritreans have been fighting since 1962 but in september 
began peace talks with the government the second round of talks is 
scheduled for nov 18 in kenyas capital nairobi 
the government recouped most of its losses in tigre but the 
lines in eritrea remained static another liberation front 
offensive from february to march pushed government forces out of 
nearly all of tigre setting the stage for the recent offensive 
the reports said a string of rebel victories pushed 20000 
government troops and thousands of civil servants from the tigrean 
provincial capital of mekele south to maychew near tigres 
southern border and out of the province and into neighboring wollo 
last month 
diplomats said the army suffered a major defeat in maychew 
where they said the rebels destroyed at least 15 sovietmade tanks 
and captured more than 20 the rebels also seized an unknown number 
of antiaircraft guns multiple rocket launchers and ammunition 
they said 
two divisions were wiped out said one western diplomat 
the liberation front in a clandestine broadcast sept 20 said 
the rebels killed or wounded 17000 government troops and captured 
10300 it was impossible to verify the claim 
the ethiopian government has an estimated 313000 troops but the 
morale of the soldiers is questionable 
in addition to low troop morale mengistu also faces the problem 
of financing the war which he said consumed half of the 
impoverished nations budget this year 
the world bank calculates ethiopias per capita income at 120 a 
year and considers the horn of africa nation of 49 million people 
the worlds poorest 
diplomats say the soviet union ethiopias major arms supplier 
is pressing mengistu to seek a political solution to the fighting 
addis ababa residents say they are skeptical a negotiated end to 
the war is possible in tigre and wollo and believe the rebels will 
not stop until the current government is overthrown

tanks of radioactive waste at the governments 
nuclear reservation in washington state contain a potentially 
explosive mixture according to a fiveyearold consultants report 
the report never made public was compiled by batelle northwest 
laboratories for the operators of the hanford nuclear reservation 
in 1984 rockwell international corp according to a congressional 
expert who described its contents monday night on condition he not 
be identified 
the report estimated the potential explosive power of the 
mixture at 37 tons of tnt if all the worstcase assumptions 
underlying its analysis turned out to be true such an explosion 
would not be a nuclear blast but could scattered radioactivity 
widely 
the explosion of a similar tank at kyshtym in the soviet union 
in 1957 or 1958 scattered intense radioactivity over an area the 
size of rhode island killing hundreds of people and forcing such 
an extensive resettlement program that 30 villages simply 
disappeared from maps 
environmental groups have said similar tanks at the savannah 
river site in south carolina also pose a threat of explosion 
the hanford mixture could explode if it got too hot and as long 
as the waste is kept sufficiently moist i dont think 
realistically you can expect these tanks to blow up tomorrow the 
expert said 
he said the tank mixtures are at about 100 to 200 degrees 
fahrenheit while a realistic explosive danger would not arise 
until the temperature reached 300 to 400 degrees 
the expert said he obtained the report through state officials 
the energy department considered the report a draft which did not 
have to be released he said 
sen john glenn dohio has said he will raise the report at a 
confirmation hearing tuesday for the first members of the energy 
departments defense nuclear facilities safety board the expert 
said glenn was the author of the law that established the 
fivemember board last year 
according to this experts description from 1954 to 1975 
ferrocyanide was added to the liquid waste stream to precipitate 
radioactive cesium and radioactive stronitum two metals 
the resulting lessradioactive liquid was dumped in the ground 
and the two metals were removed while the ferrocyanide built up in 
14 of 149 singleshelled waste tanks he said 
in all 140 metric tons about 154 us tons of ferrocyanide 
waste accumulated in the tanks and as much as 30 metric tons could 
be in one tank the expert said 
the mushy waste complex also contains nitrate compounds that 
could explode and is generating explosive hydrogen and methane 
cases which have to be vented to the atmosphere he said

more than 52000 east germans have flooded into 
west germany since sept 10 including hardy britze katrin proehl 
and their 4yearold daughter this is the first of periodic 
reports of their progress as they adjust to life in the west 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for hardy britze the final 
decision to flee west came after the dreaded east german secret 
police searched his home and demanded to know how a baker could 
afford a frenchmade citroen 
they searched my business and home everything britze says 
now after abandoning friends and parents in the city of 
cottbus britze said only political reforms could take him back to 
his communist nation a prospect he says he hopes will one day come 
about 
for them im criminal now we look forward to being allowed to 
go back to visit our homes some day but that wont happen without 
major political reforms says the husky 23yearold britze 
relaxing over a few beers in frankfurt 
britze his 23yearold companion katrin proehl and their 
blonde 4yearold daughter linda arrived in west germany on 
sept 13 two days after hungary opened its western borders to the 
east german refugees 
for now they share one room in a cityrun refugee home 
furnished with twin beds a small table and desk with chairs a 
television clothes closet and wash basin 
its a little small but we expected things like that when we 
decided to come here ms proehl said in an interview we 
expected to start at the bottom and work up well be getting an 
apartment soon 
speaking as her daughter clambered on the bed to watch tv ms 
proehl said the family was encouraged by its welcome here 
everyone has been so friendly and helpful to us and shopping 
fantastic the first time we walked around the kaufhaus 
department store we spent an hour just looking and looking 
the couple came with just a few clothes and personal belongings 
packed in their car quickly for the trip from cottbus about 70 
miles south of berlin to west germany well have to start from 
scratch to furnish an apartment ms proehl said 
we left a lot behind we had our cafe and bakery our own 
business we had our own home but because of our car and business 
we had the stasi in our house checking on us 
stasi is short for staatsicherheitsdiest the east german 
secret police 
britze inherited the bakery from his grandfather and now the 
stasi will confiscate it he said 
our families grandmother mother brothers and sisters are 
all still there we telephoned them that were here but unless 
things change there i never ever want to go back ms proehl 
said 
britze added we want to be free to decide what to do for 
ourselves take care of our own business maybe go to venice or 
holland for a weekend i can save money and do that here 
britze said hes confident the family will make good in west 
germany 
i am one of the lucky ones we both already have jobs im a 
trained auto mechanic and i begin as a service station mechanic on 
nov 1 its a start and i can work up from there he said 
katrin starts the same day as a sales clerk in a boutique 
britze said we also have an apartment lined up and will move in 
within the next three months 
although britze feels free in west germany he still has 
concerns about east german secret police 
there have been cases of the stasi going to other countries 
like hungary and grabbing people off the street to take them back 
to jail in the gdr he said 
its something you cant imagine if youve never lived there 
here we are free to do as we want there youre locked in like an 
animal 
britze said his problems with east german police began 18 months 
ago when he bought a used 1982 citroen that had been imported new 
to east berlin for party members 
when they got new volvos in 1987 they sold their old cars and 
i bought one for 50000 east marks britze said that works out 
to about 3000 at the black market rate or 26000 at the official 
rate 
it was still a lot of money regardless of the rate britze 
said adding that he had saved the money from earnings at his 
bakery thats why the stasi started harassing us 
after two searches of their property by the east german police 
the couple decided to flee west hearing rumors that hungary might 
open its western border they applied for a visa to vacation there 
we didnt tell anyone our plans britze said we got our 
visa on sept 12 packed the car and drove all night we were 
searched twice by czechoslovak border guards but made it to passau 
in bavarian at noon the next day 
the family registered in passau in west germanys bavaria 
state stayed overnight then drove to frankfurt where they have 
some acquaintances

since becoming president two 
months ago fw de klerk has promised repeatedly to seek a new 
south africa to an extent it is here 
in the old south africa whites would have not turned on the 
staterun tv news or looked at progovernment newspapers and seen 
african national congress leader walter sisulu gazing back fist 
raised a free man 
but on monday there was sisulu flanked by six colleagues on 
tv and the front pages of virtually every daily paper in the 
country their guerrilla movement technically remains outlawed but 
at a news conference sunday following their release from long 
prison terms they made clear that they were back at work 
the anc has never lost its hold on support in the black 
community but most whites have accepted the governments view that 
it was a communistcontrolled terrorist group bent on forcible 
seizure of power and imposition of a oneparty system 
since de klerk replaced pw botha in august however the 
political climate has changed dramatically for the first time the 
government is openly acknowledging the ancs broad popularity among 
blacks and even relatively conservative whites are beginning to 
accept the inevitability of negotiations between the guerrillas and 
the government 
a difficult dangerous period lies ahead of us but this is 
inevitable if there is to be a new south africa said an 
editorial monday in the citizen one of the newspapers most loyal 
to de klerk 
the change in perceptions was epitomized by the remarkably 
highprofile coverage that progovernment media gave to the anc 
news conference sunday beeld the largestcirculation daily for 
the akrikaners who dominate the government ran a banner headline 
sisulu speaks out above a large color photo of the seven anc 
leaders raising clenched fists 
the south african broadcasting corp showed the same scene on 
its morning news with sisulu urging orderly and disciplined 
pressure to force the government into further concessions 
beeld significantly played down the freed prisoners 
endorsment of continued guerrilla activity by the anc and began its 
article with sisulus call for a democratic system in which either 
a black or a white could be president there seemed to be no effort 
by the newspaper nor by the tv network to stir up antipathy 
toward the anc 
the release of the seven anc leaders along with a member of a 
smaller guerrilla movement was the most dramatic move yet taken by 
de klerk but it followed a series of recent steps by government 
officials aimed at enhancing the prospects for blackwhite 
negotiations 
among these moves 
for the first time in years the government has allowed mass 
demonstrations and marches by antiapartheid activists hundreds of 
thousands of people have joined these marches in recent weeks 
openly displaying anc banners which in the past were likely to 
provoke police action 
the pace of desegregation has quickened johannesburg the 
countrys largest city has eliminated the last of its whitesonly 
public facilities and only a handful of beaches remain segregated 
de klerk met for three hours with three prominent 
antiapartheid church leaders including anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu by far the longest such talks in recent years between 
a head of state and black activists government officials held 
their first direct negotiations with activists on a 3yearold rent 
boycott in soweto the countrys largest black township 
there is debate over the degree to which these moves were 
influenced by foreign political pressure de klerk says he intended 
to move toward racial reconciliation regardless of overseas 
opinion but there no question that the threat of further sanctions 
has been on his mind 
mr de klerk had to move quickly after his inauguration 
said con botha chief spokesman for the governing national party 
this the prisoner release is a continuation of what he said he 
would do to make it possible for the leaders to get together to 
negotiate 
as yet de klerk has won only modest praise for his moves both 
at home and abroad those whose goal is a nonracial democracy are 
unlikly to applaud until the national party negotiates itself out 
of power 
almost wistfully de klerk spoke of this lack of recognition 
after meeting tutu last week 
it appears he said as if the undertakings of this 
government have not been fully appreciated

marina ogilvy is two months pregnant and refuses 
to marry the father until the child is born she says her parents 
are demanding they marry now or have an abortion 
it is a sad and commonplace tale of modern morality but it is 
also an uncommonly public royal scandal miss ogilvy is 24th in 
line to the throne her mother being the first cousin of queen 
elizabeth ii 
the royal family recently suffered the breakup of the marriage 
of princess anne the queens daughter now royalwatchers say 
miss ogilvy 23 has broken palace taboos by going public in lurid 
detail about her estrangement from her parents sir angus ogilvy 
and princess alexandra 
the affair took on bigger dimensions monday when miss ogilvy 
clutching the hand of boyfriend paul mowatt broadcast a tearful 
plea to her mother over bbctv 
i want you to really stand by me and love me as a mother 
she said in the taped interview with host robert kilroysilk 
we believe we are doing the right thing and its what we want 
to do miss ogilvy said 
i dont agree that marina should be pushed up the aisle into 
as such a shotgun wedding mowatt said they said the baby is 
due in may and they plan to marry sometime afterward 
miss ogilvy said in an interview published oct 9 in today a 
london tabloid that her parents had tried to trick her into an 
abortion disowned her and cut off her 160000 trust fund and 
450 monthly allowance 
her parents in brief statements from their official st jamess 
palace residence denied being cut off from their daughter 
they also have a son james 
marinas parents sadly do not know where she is but marina has 
their telephone numbers and they would love her to get in touch 
with them said a statement issued sunday night 
kilroysilk duly obliged by asking one of his talk show guests 
a royalwatching journalist who knows miss ogilvy to give her 
parents the phone number 
the parents are making an official tour to india and nepal later 
this week and at the moment the tour has to proceed said their 
spokeswoman 
buckingham palace the queens residence declined to comment 
princess alexandra 52 receives 230000 annually from the 
money the state gives the queen and it pays mainly for official 
duties ogilvy a commoner businessman refused a royal title when 
he married alexandra in 1963 
mowatt a 26yearold freelance photographer says he did not 
know miss ogilvy had royal connections until after their affair 
began miss ogilvy says that when she and mowatt visited her 
parents at their richmond park mansion in west london on sept 29 
they issued an ultimatum that you both get married before you 
have the child or you have an abortion if you dont do that we 
dont really want anything to do with you 
i expected them to say whatever decision you come to i 
want you to know we will stand by you she said 
andrew morton author of seven books on royalty was quoted in 
the sunday times as saying miss ogilvy had committed an act of 
betrayal no member of the royal family has ever done anything 
as bitter as this 
harold brooksbaker publishing director of the british 
bluebloods bible burkes peerage said he was dismayed by miss 
ogilvys public antics 
the strength of the royal family is that theyve always closed 
ranks and stuck together he said disagreements always 
happened behind palace walls 
he described princess alexandra as probably the most 
compassionate person the royal family ever produced no child 
should act that way even toward parents who are less perfect than 
these the ogilvys are 
she has exposed the achilles heel of the royal family to the 
world he said if were going to look at every single human 
foible that people in the royal family have and decide the post is 
no longer useful the monarchy will disappear 
its of great interest to the public but not in the public 
interest he said

anthony lipschitz lifted himself into 
the silvertrimmed saddle atop the gray arabian pulled down his 
black cowboy hat and rode into the corral to start the first rodeo 
ever seen in these here parts 
the rocky hills west of jerusalem seem an unlikely spot for a 
rodeo but lipschitz and his partner doobi solomon on monday 
managed to draw a crowd of several hundred to watch the horseplay 
eat corn on the cob and listen to songs such as you are my 
sunshine 
riders from the galilee the golan and even the occupied west 
bank roped calves pushed their steeds around barrels and made mad 
leaps onto galloping horses in the pony express ride much to the 
delight of younsters in skullcaps packing plastic pistols 
ive got horses in my blood lipschitz said when asked why 
he started a rodeo and riding school near jerusalem whose stony 
slopes are more associated with biblical shepherds than cowboys of 
the old west 
he and solomon are unlikely cowpokes lipschitz is from south 
africa his partner from rosh pina in northern israel both fell in 
love with rodeos from seeing them in the united states 
lipschitz 48 said he has always loved horses his father 
raised thoroughbreds but it was in texas and arizona that he 
got bitten by the rodeo bug about seven years ago 
when he decided to open a riding school in israel in 1987 he 
went to scotland to buy purebred arabians originally from lands to 
the east that israel has been at war with since its founding in 
1948 he calls his horse shades of silver 
solomon 33 spent two years in oklahoma and california learning 
rodeo tricks from reg camarillo brother of world champion cowboy 
leo camarillo before he returned to his native northern israel to 
start a horse ranch 
he was a good teacher i was a good student the bearded 
solomon said after he had put on a show roping dogies 
there have been other rodeos in northern israel where there are 
real working cowboys but solomon said none had ever been 
organized around jerusalem 
he said he hoped soon to have a full americanstyle rodeo but 
that neve ilan nestled in the hills above the arab village of abu 
gosh 10 miles west of jerusalem did not yet have the facilities 
for bucking broncos and bull riding 
you need a higher fence he said 
even without the more dangerous rodeo rides the crowd seemed 
happy many bought straw cowboystyle hats made in hong kong for 
5 apiece and tapped their feet to a trio of fiddle guitar and 
banjo 
im from out west the west bronx fiddler bruce brill 
replied when asked where he learned to play his guitarplaying 
friend dave mencher is from another new york city borough 
brooklyn and banjo player sid singer is from liverpool england 
steve berger who shoes the horses for lipschitzs riding school 
and comes from pottstown pa said he was not surprised at the 
crowds enthusiasm or size 
horses are really popular in israel he said there are 
thousands of them every week there are jumping shows there are 
races with all breeds even though theyre not regulated yet 
around him stood men and women in chaps fringed leather vests 
and broadbrimmed sweatstained hats but there were reminders 
that this was israel 1989 not texas 100 years ago 
one of the door prizes for the rodeo was special glass plating 
for the winners car to protect against stone throwers whove been 
attacking israelis in the west bank and gaza strip during the 
22month palestinian uprising 
some of the pistols tucked into belts were quite real and up to 
date worn by jewish settlers who live in the territories that 
israel captured in the 1967 middle east war and still occupies 
we should never need the guns said natie charles 
originally from livingston nj whose pistol rested in his belt 
next to the fringe of his jewish prayer shawl but its better to 
have them just like life insurance

wall street averted another black monday and had 
a blue chip day instead as some of the heaviest trading in history 
produced a rally in bigname stocks and losses in many smaller 
issues 
the dow jones average which represents stock prices of 
americas 30 biggest industrial companies rose 8812 points or 
34 percent to 265738 erasing nearly half the losses suffered 
in last weeks friday the 13th plunge 
volume totaled 41629 million shares the fourth largest in 
history 
it was a reasonably normal 400 millionshare 88point day 
new york stock exchange chairman john phelan jr joked at a news 
conference 
share prices rebounded sharply early tuesday on the tokyo stock 
exchange following its biggest drop this year the day before other 
asian stock markets followed suit rebounding from significant 
losses monday 
tokyos closelywatched nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues gained 61889 points tuesday or 179 percent in tuesdays 
morning session regaining most of the 64733 points it dropped 
monday 
gains were also posted in early trading in markets in hong kong 
singapore australia new zealand and manila the philippines 
in spite of mondays gains in the dow stocks whose prices 
declined outnumbered those that increased by a 5to4 margin at the 
new york stock exchange the 8812point gain was the fourth 
largest point rise 
when you get into a period like were in now theres always a 
flight to quality people want safety and they want companies that 
have either documented growth rates or a safe dividend said 
robert kahan manager of equity trading at montgomery securities 
inc in san francisco 
on friday the dow jones average suffered its secondbiggest 
point drop ever falling 190 points and raising fears of a repeat 
of oct 19 1987 when a friday decline turned into a monday rout 
that knocked a record 508 points off the average 
indeed it started to shape up as a repeat of black monday with 
sharp declines in foreign stock markets and the dow jones average 
falling about 63 points in the first hour monday 
but after gyrating wildly the market settled down in the 
afternoon indexes of the american stock exchange and 
overthecounter stocks fell but the new york stock exchange 
composite index rose 
what were seeing is a demonstration that the safety valves in 
the us financial system are in place and operating said david 
resler chief economist of nomura securities international inc in 
new york 
the huge trading volume for the day was exceeded only by the 600 
millionshare sessions of oct 19 and 20 1987 and the 450 million 
shares traded oct 21 1987 
in lower manhattan tourists lined up early outside the new york 
stock exchange hoping to get an eyewitness view of the trading 
spasms 
i feel like im watching a car accident said john egan 24 
a new yorker waiting to get into the visitors gallery 
but in a sign of the markets underlying strength stocks held 
up in spite of a steep decline in the us bond market and the 
weakness in foreign stock markets 
stock indexes fell 18 percent in tokyo 32 percent in london 
and a steep 128 percent in frankfurt west germany where one 
trader described trading as a blood bath 
the dollars value tracked the stock market and was mixed 
against major currencies 
traders said the stock market benefited from the experience 
gained in the 1987 crash the new york stock exchange managed to 
handle te heavy trading volume because of a big investment in 
technology made after the crash 
in addition traders were soothed by a promise over the weekend 
by the federal reserve to supply fresh money to the financial 
system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing to 
traders who lost money 
it turned out that little action by the fed was necessary as a 
precaution the central bank injected about 2 billion into the 
financial system on a day when it ordinarily would have drained 
reserves 
the fed injects money into the banking system by purchasing 
treasury securities putting cash into the hands of the sellers 
the stock market was never in any danger said angelos 
michalopoulos an independent bond trader in new york 
turmoil continued in the airline sector donald trump announced 
he was withdrawing his 7 billion bid for amr corp parent of 
american airlines after the companys stock fell however he said 
he would consider a new offer at a lower price amr fell 2225 to 
7637 
it was trouble with the pilotmanagement buyout of the parent of 
united airlines that sparked fridays 190point plunge in the dow 
the ual corp bidders continued scrambling monday to put together a 
new deal as the stock plummeted 5687 a share to 22287 
the top three leaders in trading volume were all familiar blue 
chips philip morris up 2 to 43 american telephone amp telegraph 
co up 325 to 43 and international business machines corp up 
1 to 103 
at the new york stock exchange all of the systems throughout 
the exchange have functioned extremely well throughout the day 
chief spokesman richard torrenzano said there has been no delay 
of any kind 
there were communications all day between the stock exchanges 
the federal reserve and the securities and exchange commission

chanting in english we are here to stay more 
than 4000 young people jammed into an east berlin church for a 
rock concert by musicians from across the land whose works bitingly 
lampooned communist leaders 
while east germanys opposition leaders have long flocked to the 
relative safety of lutheran churches the concert symbolized the 
new fervor of the growing movement to open up a tightlycontrolled 
society 
young and inspired by the zeal that carried along the 1960s 
protest movements in the united states and europe the supporters 
of east germanys opposition movement are vowing to push for 
changes from within 
they do not want to join the refugee exodus 
rock bands and folk singers from across east germany put on 
sundays benefit at the church of the redeemer in east berlin to 
raise money for protesters who face trial after being arrested at 
recent huge street demonstrations 
balladeers ridiculed the communist governments sudden professed 
willingness for dialogue and the crowd sang along in english as a 
band played john lennons give peace a chance 
a folk singer from leipzig parodied the rapid transformation 
last week of the communist partys orthodox ideology chief kurt 
hager from hardliner to advocate of dialogue 
now kurt hager has invented dialogue went one refrain 
followed by the sarcastic reforms we can start those tomorrow 
opposition groups believe the hardline communist government is 
attempting to sidetrack growing public calls for reforms by 
promising a limited dialogue with opposition groups it has long 
suppressed 
the protests and the exodus of tens of thousands of east germans 
to the west in recent months have forced the government to be more 
conciliatory to growing demands for change 
but communist leader erich honecker has rejected any talks with 
opposition groups 
speakers at sundays benefit also talked of the brutal treatment 
some protesters received after their arrest during demonstrations 
in east berlin 
a man was forced to stand for 16 hours at a police station 
before he collapsed said one of the speakers two policemen 
beat him until he pulled himself up 
during the more than threehour event representatives of 
several opposition and reformminded artistic groups announced new 
protest plans and initiatives 
members of the working theater federation vowed to hold a march 
demanding press freedoms on nov 4 for example 
others called for reforms in the nations closely supervised 
education system and an independent investigation into the behavior 
of state security forces during protests in cities across the 
nation 
police have used force to end many demonstrations 
students groups declared their intention to form independent 
federations and university officials demanded authorities not 
aexpel students for taking part in the demonstrations

smoking foes are proclaiming victory following 
housesenate negotiators vote to ban smoking on all continental 
us airline routes and on many flights to and from hawaii and 
alaska 
the restrictions which must be approved by the house and senate 
before being sent to president bush would cover practically all of 
the 16000 airline flights scheduled in the united states each day 
by the estimate of tobacco industry lobbyist charlie whitley 
the rules would allow smoking on about 55 flights daily lobbyist 
jo ellen deutsch of the association of flight attendants said she 
thought smoking would be permitted on fewer than 20 flights a day 
this isnt even a compromise said nancy hailpern lobbyist 
for the american cancer society one of many health groups that 
fought to expand current antismoking rules were using the word 
compromise basically for the benefit of the other side 
with few exceptions every airline passenger in america now 
can look forward to smokefree travel said rep richard durbin 
dill who helped write the measure 
durbin and sen frank lautenberg dnj who championed an 
airline smoking ban in the senate predicted the legislation would 
be approved by congress 
i dont think well have a bit of a problem lautenberg said 
the tobacco industry was battered in congress this year when on 
aug 2 the house voted 259169 to make permanent the current 
smoking ban on flights of two hours or less 
on sept 14 the senate voted 7721 against cigarettestate 
lawmakers effort to prevent adoption of even stricter rules the 
senate then passed a permanent ban on all flights by a voice vote 
with those defeats behind them tobacco interests had to accept 
what they could get 
whitley a former democratic congressman from north carolina 
said of the adopted language as much as it preserves well take 
that 
flights from the west coast to hawaii and alaska are scheduled 
for less than six hours and would be covered by the ban lautenberg 
and others said uncovered would be nonstop flights to those 
states originating in the central and eastern united states 
the prohibition would also apply to flights to or from us 
possessions in the caribbean but not to guam 
the current prohibition on smoking during short flights covers 
80 percent of us routes those restrictions are scheduled to 
expire in april 1990 the new rules will take effect 95 days after 
they are signed into law 
the provision is part of an 119 billion transportation measure 
for fiscal 1990 which housesenate negotiators are still trying to 
complete 
during bargaining lasting several hours lautenberg initially 
said he would insist that if house negotiators did not adopt the 
senate language he would force the house to vote on his proposal 
he said he believed he would have prevailed on the house floor 
but after house whip william h gray iii dpa and several 
others objected lautenberg accepted the compromise offered by rep 
martin sabo dminn 
i just felt it was a long a very very long time for people 
not to be smoking sabo said referring to the flights lasting 
more than six hours 
senate negotiators accepted the compromise without voting the 
11 house bargainers adopted the language on a show of hands there 
was no official vote count but the only member seen voting against 
it was rep jamie whitten dmiss

all danny morales ever wanted was to become a 
police officer so much so that he never considered college or 
another career in his 21 years 
when the dream began to slip away he took the revolver he had 
hoped to use as an officer and killed himself friday in front of 
his instructor on the police training academy shooting range 
ever since first grade he has wanted to be a police officer 
said linda zwier 21 his girlfriend it was the only dream that 
he had ever had and he never talked about college he never talked 
about doing anything else 
he was very focused and dedicated much more than most 
people said an uncle mark morales of louisville ky i admire 
the fact that he knew what he wanted to do with his life there are 
people who spend all of their lives searching for that 
his father and four uncles among them won six city high school 
wrestling championships and three state championships when 
morales turn came he didnt disappoint winning two city 
conference championships 
after graduating from milwaukee tech high school morales got a 
job as a police aide he studied police science at milwaukee area 
technical college biding his time until he turned 21 old enough 
to apply to the department 
he was accepted to the recruit class that started training aug 
20 but a month later his grasp on his future started to slip 
he failed a firing range test and then failed the retest and 
resigned from the academy sept 29 
then he found out he was nearsighted got glasses and appealed 
his resignation trainers gave him another chance to take the test 
on friday after a week of remedial training and full of renewed 
hope he returned to the range to retake the test 
danny felt real good and felt confident said geary morales 
of st francis minn another uncle 
but it quickly became clear the glasses hadnt helped 
morales needed a score of 210 of 300 in three rounds of shooting 
he scored a poor 62 in the first round and 66 in the second he 
needed an 82 in the third round and it was clear he couldnt get 
it 
with one shot left morales turned his gun on himself according 
to the milwaukee county medical examiners report 
family and friends preparing for morales burial today said 
suicide was completely out of character 
i think the environment he was in alone in that firing range 
didnt give him an opportunity to talk to someone for a few 
minutes and the fear was overwhelming said geary morales 
adding he wasnt criticizing the police department 
police lt peter pochowski who was morales supervisor when he 
worked as an police aide said i believe it was a splitsecond 
decision it was not part of his life plan that day in that one 
second he saw his whole world collapse and he couldnt face what 
had happened 
i just assumed he would do well in whatever he did 
pochowski said he was a blue chipper he was going to be one 
hell of a cop

the nuclear regulatory commission is 
investigating charges by members of its staff that senior agency 
officials tried to cover up evidence of serious problems at the 
comanche peak nuclear power plant in texas 
in an oct 4 letter to commission chairman kenneth carr an 
anonymous group of nrc inspectors said senior nrc officials had 
manipulated inspection data to make it look as though the plant was 
ready for fuel loading although the inspectors said it was not 
a copy of the letter and documents spelling out the commissions 
plans to investigate the matter were released by the nrc on monday 
a special team of commission inspectors was dispatched to 
comanche peak about 40 miles southwest of fort worth on monday to 
begin an 11day assessment of the plants readiness to begin 
loading fuel for lowpower testing the 9 billion plant got its 
construction permit in 1974 but has never operated 
the plant had been scheduled to start loading fuel sometime this 
month although nrc efforts to verify the allegations appear likely 
to delay the procedure 
the anonymous inspectors implied agency documents had been 
edited to create an untrue impression of the plants readiness to 
operate and negative information about the plant owners 
performance was deliberately withheld from official inspection 
reports 
we believe that the commission should be aware of what we view 
as manipulation and the exclusion of factual information the 
inspectors wrote in the letter 
if such information were properly considered and evaluated it 
would indicate a less than satisfactory performance rating in some 
areas by the plant owner texas utilities electric co and a 
need for improvements before the nrc approves fuel loading the 
letter said 
joe fouchard an nrc spokesman said the commission does not 
know who wrote the letter but has no doubt that it is legitimate 
we are treating it seriously fouchard said 
executives of texas utilities are scheduled to meet with the 
fivemember commission at its rockville md headquarters on 
thursday to discuss the matter 
the letter did not spell out the flaws at comanche peak the 
inspectors contended were covered up by the nrc but the authors 
included pages of draft inspection reports and internal nrc memos 
they said demonstrated the seriousness of the problems 
the nrc declined to release the draft inspection reports and 
internal memos 
thomas murley director of the agencys office of nuclear 
reactor regulation said in an oct 10 letter to james m taylor 
the acting nrc chief of staff that he had referred the coverup 
allegations to the nrc inspector general 
murley wrote that he agreed comanche peak was not ready for fuel 
loading and assured taylor no nrc decisions had been made about the 
plants readiness 
in their letter to carr the nrc inspectors said a draft report 
on texas utilities performance at comanche peak had incorrectly 
concluded that there were no problems there 
the letter said the views of those who knew the real 
performance had been outvoted by senior nrc officials who had 
little or no direct involvement with the site 
additionally information and findings brought to the 
attention of the senior nrc officials were deliberately excluded 
giving a false impression about the plant the letter said 
comanche peak is one of the most thoroughly inspected nuclear 
power plants in the nation after about 1000 allegations of 
construction flaws surfaced in 1982 texas utilities switched 
engineering contractors and spent several years reverifying the 
plants design and repeating tests required by the nrc

attorney general dick thornburgh is coming 
under criticism from the irancontra prosecutor for delaying the 
criminal trial of a former cia station chief 
independent counsel lawrence walsh said monday that thornburgh 
for no legitimate reason is using court appeals to sidetrack 
the prosecution of joseph fernandez 
fernandez was scheduled to go on trial in july but the justice 
department went to the appeals court after us district court 
judge claude hilton in alexandria va said fernandez was entitled 
to disclose certain government secrets 
last week without notifying walsh at the time the justice 
department asked the appeals court for another month to consider 
whether to seek a rehearing the motion was granted on friday 
fernandez who assisted oliver norths contra resupply network 
is accused of obstructing the tower commission and the cia 
inspector generals offices and making false statements 
thornburgh has repeatedly thwarted the prosecution by 
lastminute unannounced procedural maneuvers designed only to tie 
this case in a knot of endless litigation walsh said 
walsh said thornburgh has asserted no legitimate reason for 
delay and that there is every reason to proceed promptly 
asked about walshs arguments justice department spokesman 
daniel eramian said we wont respond unless the court asks us 
to 
after the appeals court ruled against the justice department 
said walsh assistant attorney general edward dennis on oct 2 
reported the department probably would not seek further court 
review dennis head of the departments criminal division said 
thornburgh probably would file an affidavit prohibiting disclosure 
of the information at the fernandez trial said walshs court 
papers 
such a step could result in the charges against fernandez being 
dismissed 
in addition said walsh a justice department criminal division 
attorney indicated last wednesday the division had sent a memo to 
the solicitor general recommending against seeking further appeals 
court review the criminal division attorney said it was a 
virtual certainty the solicitor general would concur with the 
recommendation walshs court papers said 
walsh complained the attorney general provided no notice he had 
decided to file the request for an extension the justice 
department and walshs office have worked closely on secrecy issues 
for three years in this instance the justice department mailed 
walsh a copy of his request depriving the independent counsel of 
an opportunity to respond before the court acted the court papers 
stated 
the departments request for the extension was prepared last 
wednesday the day justice department spokesman david runkel 
assured reporters in a memo that there are no new developments in 
the fernandez case 
asked on friday about the discrepancy between his statement and 
the departments actions runkel said he was unaware that 
government lawyers were preparing to file the request for the 
extension 
walsh said the information thornburgh seeks to protect is 
widely known to the public such as the existence of cia stations 
in latin america 
the appeals court said in a decision sept 29 that thornburghs 
only recourse in protecting the information is to file an affidavit 
which would prohibit its use at fernandezs trial such a step 
could lead to dropping the criminal charges against the excia 
officer

marines who marched behind the slogan rape 
kill pillage burn during basic training at parris island sc 
this summer are being told their drill instructor recants the use 
of the words 
the flag that carried the saying has been destroyed capt jr 
mill public affairs officer at the training depot said monday 
mill said the approximately 70 members of the platoon 1066 all 
received a letter from staff sgt bc kirkpatrick 
as your former senior drill instructor in platoon 1066 i 
would like to correct a misconception you may have about words 
written on our basic warrior training guidon flag said the 
letter 
these words rape kill pillage and burn were certainly 
not an expression of my true beliefs or an official marine corps 
slogan 
the letter dated oct 6 followed a complaint four days earlier 
by the mother of one of the recruits who saw the sign in a 
graduation photograph of her sons basic training platoon 
another sign in the picture showed a naked woman the signs were 
used during marching drills 
sen john mccain rariz received the mothers complaint and 
immediately asked the marine commandant to investigate 
mccain said friday that he was satisfied the corps was reacting 
appropriately but still expected a full report 
he called the use of the signs a failure in leadership saying 
it shows a lack of supervision 
mill said the signs were made by and for the platoon under 
kirkpatricks leadership that graduated in august 
the letter from kirkpatrick said some day in combat we may 
be confronted with the harsh necessity to kill or destroy but 
glorifying these activities or suggesting that we commit serious 
crimes is inappropriate and simply not true 
kirkpatrick advised in his letter that the marines refer to the 
principles taught in their class on the law of war 
furthermore he said a marine is one who possesses the 
highest in military virtues and obeys orders respects his 
seniors and strives constantly to be the best in everything he 
does

senate majority leader george mitchell says 
president bush is retreating from the us commitment to ban all 
chemical weapons production and stockpiling worldwide 
mitchell and other democrats say bush in an apparent shift in 
position is embracing a compromise that would permit the united 
states to continue producing chemical weapons years after a treaty 
banning them is ratified 
timidity mixed signals inconsistent statements all of 
which is what has been coming from the administration could 
result in the loss of an historic opportunity to prevent the spread 
of chemical arsenals around the world mitchell a maine 
democrat told the senate on monday 
mitchell said unless the president clarifies his position on 
this issue makes a decision and makes it known it is likely 
that little progress will be made in negotiations in geneva toward 
achieving the multilateral treaty prohibiting chemical weapons 
which the president ironically has stated is one of his highest 
priorities 
one administration arms control expert who spoke on condition 
he not be identified acknowleged the policy shift is going to 
cause a little commotion in the geneva negotiations 
bush acting as vice president in 1984 carried to geneva a 
draft text of a treaty proposing that nations signing a chemical 
weapons ban cease producing such arms immediately and destroy their 
stockpiles over a 10year period about 40 nations are taking part 
in the talks which resume in november 
on sept 25 bush proposed in a speech at the united nations 
that the united states and the soviet union cut their existing 
chemical stockpiles by 80 percent to spur the geneva negotiations 
but bush has signed a confidential order permitting the pentagon 
to continue producing a new generation of chemical weapons for an 
unspecified period of time while older stocks are being destroyed 
according to administration officials who spoke on condition they 
not be identified 
bush has said the united states is ready to destroy 98 percent 
of its chemical weapons stockpiles in the first eight years of a 
treaty provided the soviet union does likewise 
the remaining two percent would be destroyed over the following 
two years provided all nations capable of producing chemical 
weapons actually do so a condition many observers believe is 
unlikely to be met 
mitchell said if accounts of the confidential order are correct 
the order would end up encouraging the very proliferation of 
chemical weapons which the treaty is intended to prevent and 
disrupt treaty negotiations 
time and technology are not standing still mitchell said 
the evidence of the past two years is that many of the restraints 
moral political and military against the use of chemical 
weapons are weakening and the appetite of many nations to possess 
these weapons appear to have been whetted

the bush administrations game plan for trying 
to keep last fridays stock market dip from becoming an avalanche 
included distancing the issue from the white house officials say 
it was not a crisis in any sense of white house involvement 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater after the stock market 
rebounded from fridays 190point tumble with a 883 point gain on 
monday 
we didnt want to say anything that would cause anxiety the 
president said he wasnt worried things have worked out 
fitzwater continued 
still despite the outward calm evidenced by bush and his 
lieutenants on monday there were intensive and frequent 
behindthescenes consultations beginning friday among the white 
house and other us agencies wall street officials and foreign 
allies sources said 
with treasury secretary nicholas brady taking the lead for the 
administration a strategy of containment evolved over the weekend 
an effort to keep the situation from getting any worse and to 
profit from missteps made by us officials during the october 1987 
market crash 
bush at the presidential retreat at camp david md was kept 
posted on developments by phone calls through the weekend from 
brady and chief white house economist michael boskin officials 
said 
the evolving strategy was accompanied by a clear early signal by 
the federal reserve that it would flood the nations banking system 
with money if needed as it had done somewhat belatedly in the 
1987 plunge 
in fact the fed on monday pumped some 2 billion into the 
system making it easier for banks to continue to provide credit to 
hardpressed brokerage houses and securities firms 
and sources said the strategy also called for closer economic 
coordination with the socalled g7 group of economic allies 
japan britain france west germany canada and italy in addition 
to the united states than took place last time 
in fact comments by thentreasury secretary james a baker iii 
now the secretary of state publicly criticizing germany for not 
doing more to lower interest rates to stimulate its economy on oct 
18 1987 were cited by some analysts as one factor in the record 
508point drop the next day 
this time around the white house voiced reassuring comments on 
the underlying strength of the economy even when the stock market 
appeared to be continuing to fall bush asserted im not 
worried about an hour after markets opened monday at a time when 
stock prices were posting an initial plunge 
brady chaired the presidential commission which studied the 
october 1987 crash and recommended ways for dealing with future 
market crashes some of his recommendations are now law including 
automatic triggers that suspend trading when price swings exceed a 
specified level 
the administration and some wall street analysts credited some 
of those reforms with helping put a damper on trading volatility on 
monday 
white house officials wanted to make sure it was clear brady was 
dealing with the issue along with the fed and the sec and that it 
had not reached a level of crisis where the white house should get 
involved 
brady himself drove this point home making an unscheduled 
appearance at a white house staff meeting to urge that an upbeat 
face be put on the situation and to caution against any suggestion 
of a crisis atmosphere 
later asked if there was a master crisis management plan 
presidential spokesman fitzwater said no because there wasnt a 
crisis mainly we rely on the treasury and the fed and the sec 
we have full confidence in their ability to deal with any 
situation he said 
also there is a limit to what the government can do to 
influence the stock market beyond rhetoric and pumppriming by 
the fed or in extreme cases an emergency declaration by the 
president halting trading

a former director of the national institutes 
of health says he is disappointed in the bush administrations 
reported decision to extend a ban on federal financing of medical 
experiments using fetal tissue 
james wyngaarden former director of nih and now in the white 
house office of science and technology policy had recommended the 
ban be lifted 
there are medical opportunities that might be addressed by the 
transplantation of fetal tissue he said and i thought one 
could decide on the use of fetal tissue without involving the 
abortion issue since in this country thats a legal procedure 
scientists say transplanting fetal tissue into adults may be 
effective in treating diabetes and parkinsons disease 
but antiabortion groups have warned the bush administration 
would find itself in the middle of a firestorm of protest if it did 
not continue to the ban 
the evidence is clear that if fetaltissue transplantation 
became successful therapy it would increase abortions said 
james bopp jr general counsel for the national right to life 
committee 
i would be inconceivable that a prolife administration would 
have the government sponsor research which would lead to an 
increase in abortion he said 
the new york times reported monday the administration would 
extend the ban that was imposed in march 1988 
james mason assistant secretary for health in the department of 
health and human services has recommended the ban be continued 
despite conclusions by two federal panels that such research holds 
promise for treating diabetes and parkinsons disease the 
newspaper said 
hhs secretary louis sullivan was expected to act within a week 
said the times which cited no sources for its information 
spokesmen for sullivan and mason would say only that the issue 
was under review in the department 
hhs imposed the ban 19 months ago while the department reviewed 
the issue in december two nih panels studied the question and 
recommended the ban be lifted 
robert windom assistant secretary for health in the reagan 
administration told the times he had been prepared to approve 
fetal tissue experiments in january but was instructed by thenhhs 
secretary otis bowen to leave the decision to the bush 
administration 
bopp said the nih advisory panel on fetal tissue research was 
stacked with people who favored such research bopp was one of 
four members of that committee who dissented from the 
recommendation that the ban be lifted 
wyngaarden who chaired another nih advisory committee which 
appointed bopps panel said bopps claims were untrue it was 
not a juryrigged committee he said adding that some on the 
panel were wrenched by the abortion issue wyngaardens 
committee received the fetal tissue advisory panels report and 
concurred recommending to windom the ban be lifted

to ban burning the american flag are urging defeat on grounds it 
would stifle freedom of speech but sponsors call it the only 
certain protection for the national symbol 
it is the intention of the drafters of this legislation to go 
after speech certain kinds of speech sen joseph r biden jr 
ddel said monday as the senate began to debate the proposed 
amendment 
biden said it would allow authorities to ignore a well kept 
businessman in a threepiece brooks brothers suit who burned the 
flag while jailing a college dropout with long hair and torn 
jeans who burned the flag 
sen strom thurmond rsc said dissent would not be stifled 
by a limit on such protest and called for support as we seek to 
protect our most cherished symbol of democracy from contemptuous 
desecration 
the measure would authorize federal and state governments to 
outlaw burning and other desecration of the flag 
the senate confined itself to debating the measure tuesday and 
aimed for a vote later this week the house would vote on the 
amendment after that 
even if approved by congress it would have to be passed by the 
legislatures of 38 states before becoming part of the constitution 
lawmakers sent to president bush on thursday a rival measure 
that would ban burning or other desecration by simple statute 
sponsors of the amendment however say the statutory ban could 
be ruled unconstitutional on the same grounds as the texas law 
thrown out by the supreme court this summer in overturning the 
conviction of flag burner gregory lee johnson 
i remain convinced that the bill that passed the congress last 
week will not survive constitutional scrutiny in light of the 
johnson decision said thurmond he said there were many ways to 
express dissent other than burning flags and those avenues should 
and will go unimpeded 
the bill already sent to bush was designed to avoid the 
constitutional question by simply barring flag desecration 
regardless of whether it involved political protest 
thse who are opposing the amendment say it would amount to 
tampering with the constitution for political reasons 
what are we going to remember more the constitution or a 
momentary political poll sen patrick j leahy dvt asked the 
senate 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said lawmakers were being asked 
to amend the bill of rights partly because of concern over the 
obnoxious act of a protester who burned the flag but largely 
because of an unseemly effort to gain partisan political advantage 
from the incident 
he said the texas protester committed a despicable act but 
he noted president bush initially seemed to accept the supreme 
courts decision in the case and only launched a campaign for an 
amendment after having lunch with gop national chairman lee atwater 
the atwaterbush amendment will do more violence to the 
constitution than gregory lee johnson could possibly have hoped to 
accomplish with his puny act of protest kennedy said 
sen alan j dixon dill said the supreme court ruling was 
a wrongheaded decision and said the amendment is needed as 
the surest protection against further acts of desecration 
its the only effective way to protect our cherished flag 
dixon said

a tape of radio transmissions involving pilot 
thomas roots 800mile autopilot flight and crash into the atlantic 
ocean provides some drama but little evidence about the mystery 
flight 
root made only one reference to trouble with the july 13 flight 
moments before he apparently blacked out for unknown reasons 
according to a tape and transcript released monday by the federal 
aviation administration 
the tape also includes an exchange between an air traffic 
controller and a military pilot who said he saw root move in the 
cockpit after passing out but then apparently lapse back into 
unconsciousness 
roots plane fell into the ocean near the bahamas when it ran 
out of gas after a sixhour journey root was flying from 
washington dc to rocky mount nc when he radioed the first 
and only indication of trouble 
ah yes sir im having a little problem up here having a 
little trouble breathing how how far am i to rocky mount now 
root asked at about 45 minutes into the flight 
the controller who was not identifed by the faa told the 
36yearold pilot he was about 17 minutes away from his destination 
root his voice faltering gave one last response ah ah 
one three 
the tape did little to clear up mysteries surrounding the july 
13 crash of the cessna aircraft piloted by root a washington 
communications attorney 
about a halfhour after roots last radio contact a military 
pilot sent up to trail the plane reported he could see the pilot 
move 
root has said he could not explain photographs that appear to 
show him turning his head and changes in the planes sun visor 
while he said he was unconscious 
sir were tracking parallel to onethree yankee and ah 
apparently the individual is unconscious his head is back his 
mike boom is away from his face the military pilot said 
a few minutes later he said however we just saw the 
individual move his head forward 
the controller asked whether that might have been caused by the 
aircraft bouncing around in turbulence 
no sir we were relatively stable and it appeared he had 
rocked his head forward and then back the military pilot said 
the tape which covered communications from air traffic 
controllers and other planes during most of the first two hours of 
roots flight had no further reference to movements by root the 
alexandria va resident has said the first thing he remembers 
after blacking out was finding himself in the water 
faa spokesman fred farrar said military communications after 
roots plane left faacontrolled airways were not available 
root also was treated for a gunshot wound after he was rescued 
from the water he has said the impact of the plane hitting the 
water must have discharged a pistol in the cockpit the guns maker 
said that couldnt have happened but authorities have offered no 
other explanation for the wound 
no sound of a gunshot is heard on the tape and there is no 
reference to a gunshot in the communications 
medical tests found no evidence that root used drugs suffered 
from carbon monoxide poisoning or had a heart problem during the 
flight

the bush administration wants the supreme 
court to prevent a missouri couple from removing life support from 
their 31yearold daughter left severely brain damaged in a car 
crash 
in the first right to die case before the supreme court the 
justice department sided monday with the state of misouris effort 
to stop nancy cruzans parents from ending her life support 
the justice departments friendofthecourt brief reaffirmed a 
narrow doctrine of privacy consistent with its recent filings 
attacking roe vs wade the 1973 decision that legalized abortion 
the administration is lining up against the american medical 
assocation and other groups which point out that many legislatures 
and a handful of state appeals courts have supported the withdrawal 
of lifesustaining treatment in cases such as the one in missouri 
in the case before the supreme court joe and joyce cruzans 
contend their right of privacy protects from state intrusion 
their decision to allow doctors to remove a feeding tube implanted 
in their daughters stomach following a 1983 automobile accident 
that left the woman brain damaged 
the brief by solicitor general kenneth w starr urged the high 
court to ignore abstract notions of a generalized right to 
privacy and limit the scope of substantive due process to those 
interests that have received he sanction of history tradition and 
law 
the court should decline petitioners invitation to extend the 
right of privacy to cover all types of decisions about medical 
treatment and procedures the administration argued 
the carterville mo couple contended in a lower court that 
their daughter told them she didnt want to live if faced with 
life as a vegetable 
but the justice department defended the missouri supreme courts 
43 decision that the cruzans had not presented clear and 
convincing evidence their daughter would choose to die a death of 
slow starvation and dehydration 
the missouri court reasonably concluded that any error should 
be made on the side of life the department said 
they defended the missouri courts refusal to consider as 
conclusive evidence the cruzans statements that their daughter 
would not want a life sustained only by a feeding tube 
human experience unfortunately teaches that unlike the 
petitioners family not every family will have the best interests 
of the patient at heart the brief said thus although it 
would be odd for a state rigidly to disregard all evidence from the 
patients family members it also need not give such evidence 
conclusive weight 
the view of privacy outlined by the department echoes its recent 
arguments for greater limits on abortion 
the department argues there may be a liberty interest in 
having an abortion but not a fundamental right to the procedure 
that the state has no role in regulating 
as in abortion the department said the constitution should be 
construed to give the states considerable flexibility in adopting 
rules about refusing medical treatment to further its profound 
interest in preserving human life 
a state plainly has a strong interest in ensuring that any 
decision to refuse lifesustaining treatment is made after careful 
thought and full consideration of the consequences the justice 
department said 
a currently incompetent adult however is by definition 
unable to give careful thought to the lifeanddeath questions 
regarding medical care

navy experts say the explosion on the uss iowa 
that killed 47 sailors was caused by a chemical bomb placed between 
gunpowder bags according to a published report today 
a study by the navy described by the washington post concluded a 
container of fuel such as hydraulic fluid put inside a bag with 
an oxidizer was the cause of the explosion last april in the 
battleships no 2 gun turret 
the navys findings were contained in a report given to 
congressional investigators the newspaper said 
earlier theories that an electrical device was inserted between 
the powder bags have been ruled out by navy explosive experts the 
paper said 
in an earlier report the navy concluded clayton hartwig a 
gunners mate second class most likely deliberately caused the 
explosion because he was upset about the breakup of a friendship 
with one sailor and the rejection by another shipmate of his 
homosexual advances 
the new report says hartwig may have spread the oxidizer a 
cleaning powder on steel wool and put the fuel in a plastic vial 
the newspaper said he then put the substances in a lead foil sack 
that fit between two powder bags that were rammed into the breech 
of one of the ships 16inch guns according to the report

neighborhoods buy and preserve open spaces honigman agreed to give 
up his trademark sockless look last week however he delayed 
keeping his promise until monday because he had to buy some socks 
first 
i bought quite a few pairs of the most unusual variety he

rogers corp stopped paying for the street 
lights so some residents of this northeast connecticut village 
want to stop using the companys name for their community 
many of the older residents feel betrayed said roger 
fontaine an 18year village resident and spokesman for a group 
campaigning to go back to the original name williamsville 
that name was changed to goodyear in the early 1900s after the 
goodyear tire amp ruber co moved into the area in 1954 goodyear 
moved out rogers corp which makes synthetic resins moved in 
and the companys president saul silverstein asked residents to 
change the villages name to rogers 
in exchange silverstein said he would pay for the villages 22 
street lights 
but last summer rogers corp officials decided 2600 a year 
was too much to pay for street lights and the village went dark

shareholders money said company spokesman william 
schoppenhorst we give to a lot of chrities 
ronald robinson head of corporate facilities for rogers admits 
he wouldnt mind a name change

hundreds of teenagers who dont want to 
dissect a frog have called a hot line run by the mother of a girl 
whose biologyclass battle turned into a national animalrights 
effort 
most students who call want to know what their rights are how 
they should talk to their teachers said pat graham mother of 
jenifer graham a vegetarian whose moral objection to dissection 
led her to court 
ive had students cry to me on the phone theyre often 
distraught especially if they feel they cant talk to their 
parents ms graham said monday she appeared at a news 
conference to spread the word about the tollfree line sponsored by 
the animal legal defense fund 
the animal rights supporters hope their cause will get a boost 
from todays scheduled broadcast of jenifers story in frog 
girl on cbstvs schoolbreak special 
jenifer refused to dissect a frog in her sophomore biology class 
at victor valley high school in victorville in 1987 
in the ensuing battle with school officials she said she had 
moral objections to killing animals for research and maintained 
she should be allowed to learn frog anatomy from a model or 
computer program 
the case attracted the attention of animalrights attorneys and 
eventually led the legislature to approve a bill that gives 
students in kindergarten through 12th grade the right to refuse to 
dissect animals 
jenifer graduated and now is a freshman at california state 
university san bernardino but she maintains the high school 
unfairly lowered her biology grade and is pressing a federal 
lawsuit against the district seeking to establish a legal right to 
refuse to dissect animals 
the animal legal defense fund is starting a campaign to inform 
more high school and college students about their right to refuse 
to dissect animals and about animal rights in general executive 
director joyce tischler said monday 
the group offers handbooks on animal rights for students and 
teachers and hopes to get the cooperation of national science 
teachers associations in the distribution of its materials 
the organization estimates that 57 million animals mostly 
frogs are killed each year for high school and college students to 
dissect in classrooms it advocates alternatives such as videotapes 
showing dissections and the use of plastic models of animals and 
their insides

a kgb official handed over the personal effects of 
raoul wallenberg to his relatives nearly 45 years after the swedish 
diplomat was arrested by the soviets in budapest and insisted he 
had died in jail 
soviet officials also for the first time expressed remorse about 
the arrest of wallenberg who saved tens of thousands of jews from 
nazi gas chambers during world war ii 
the detention of wallenberg was a tragic mistake foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said monday in a press 
briefing 
wallenbergs halfsister nina lagergren received the passport 
drivers license address book calendar and cash her halfbrother 
carried when he was arrested in january 1945 
it was terribly emotional to see his handwriting and his 
photograph and his identity papers ms lagergren said 
family and friends from the raoul wallenberg association in 
stockholm were in moscow at the kremlins invitation looking for 
clues about the fate of the swedish diplomat who would be 77 today 
the move to clarify what has become a diplomatic embarrassment 
for the soviet union came under the political reforms of president 
mikhail s gorbachev previous governments attempted to ignore the 
case 
the delegation gave the soviets a list of reported sightings of 
wallenberg in soviet prison camps and were to meet with officials 
twice more this week according to per anger head of the 
association he refused to say when and where wallenberg was last 
reported seen 
but dashing hopes that the kremlin might have new information 
on wallenbergs fate the soviets clung to their decadesold 
assertion that he died of a heart attack in 1947 at lubyanka the 
kgb prison in moscow 
human rights activist andrei sakharov and his wife yelena 
bonner have made several trips to prison camps in search of 
wallenberg but never turned up anything 
ms lagergren however said she believes wallenberg still is in 
isolation at a soviet prison his identity long covered up 
we are confident that he has been able to survive he said 
anger a colleague of wallenberg in hungary said kremlin 
officials serving now may be genuinely ignorant of wallenbergs 
fate 
we think its difficult to find people in the gulag he 
said referring to the soviet prison camp network 
the only proof of death offered by vladimir pirozhkov deputy 
chief of the kgb and deputy foreign minister valentin nikiforov 
was a doctors letter reporting the death which was announced in 
1957 
pirozhkov told the group wallenbergs personal effects were 
found in kgb headquarters in lubyanka last month said guy von 
dardel wallenbergs halfbrother 
wallenbergs blue diplomatic passport stamped with the three 
crowns of sweden shows a squarejawed balding 32yearold man 
it carries all the necessary stamps of sweden hungary and nazi 
germany to show the university of michigan graduate had full 
diplomatic immunity when he was arrested 
anger said the passport proves that soviet secret police 
deliberately violated international law when they charged 
wallenberg with spying after soviet troops entered budapest 
nikolai uspensky chief of the foreign ministrys second 
european department said the delegation was told that wallenbergs 
remains were cremated and buried in a common grave at moscows 
donskoy monastery 
we gave an exhaustive account of the bleak period in our past 
history in which raoul wallenberg found himself involved 
uspensky said it is our hope that this meeting made it possible 
to identify all the minor details related to the tragic fate of 
wallenberg 
the letter written by a doctor named smartsov to the prison 
director said prisoner wallenberg suddenly died last night of a 
heart attack following your directive on personal supervision of 
wallenberg please give me instructions on ways to dispose of the 
body 
wallenberg issued swedish travel documents to 20000 hungarian 
jews slated for nazi concentration camps his intervention with 
german authorities was credited with winning survival for another 
100000 jews

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange bounced 
back by more than 500 points tuesday regaining most of what it had 
lost during the previous days trading

news of a partial recovery in new york and the revival in tokyo 
on the tokyo foreign exchange market the dollar closed at 
14235 yen up 150 yen from mondays close it had opened at

anonymity said factors affecting the plunge in new york friday 
were totally different from those during the black monday crash 
of october 1987 when the tokyo exchanges main market barometer 
fell 15 percent in one day 
he said there was no reason to fear fridays plunge would send 
stock markets crashing worldwide 
the crash in new york friday was not linked to uneasiness 
about funds as was the crash of black monday the dealer said 
during the crash two years ago he said there was a 2 percent 
spread between interest on treasury bills and another key 
shortterm interest rate which suggested there might be a flight 
away from purchasing government bonds 
but the spread is only 1 percent now he said 
the dealer also said good news precipitated tuesdays stock 
market rebound including the recovery on wall street and 
statements by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan that the fed 
would engage in necessary intervention to prevent the crash from 
expanding 
japanese finance minister ryutaro repeated remarks he made 
monday that he wasnt seriously concerned about the impact of 
fridays plunge in new york on japanese markets

said speaking at a press conference after a regular cabinet 
meeting

a judge sentenced attorney e robert wallach to 
six years in prison saying the close associate of former attorney 
general edwin meese iii sold his influence on the white house back 
stairs in the wedtech scandal 
us district judge richard owen also fined wallach 250000 and 
ordered him to forfeit 425000 in illegal payoffs he got from 
wedtech corp to influence meese and other government officials to 
help the south bronx defense contractor win government contracts 
too much success can bring failure i am the epitome of that 
and i am paying for it wallach who has known meese since they 
attended law school together told owen during mondays sentencing 
a jury convicted wallach 55 of san francisco on aug 8 of 
racketeering two fraud charges and conspiracy to defraud the us 
government for his dealings with the nowdefunct wedtech 
the litany of these things i am sickened to talk about 
them the judge told wallach he scolded wallach for selling 
your influence on the back stairs of the white house 
owen also gave prison sentences and stiff fines to wallachs two 
codefendants former meese financial adviser w franklyn chinn and 
chinns business associate r kent london 
owen sentenced chinn 47 of san francisco to three years in 
prison and fined him 100000 and sentenced london 46 of 
honolulu to five years in prison and fined him 250000 the judge 
also ordered chinn and london to forfeit a 114 million consulting 
fee they received from wedtech 
chinn and london were convicted of racketeering racketeering 
conspiracy and fraud charges stemming from payments wedtech gave 
them 
wallach who would be eligible for parole after serving two 
years in prison was free pending appeal lawyers for chinn and 
london also indicated they would appeal 
evidence at wallachs and other wedtech trials showed that the 
onetime small machine shop grew into a multimilliondollar 
military contractor through various bribe schemes 
wedtech which collapsed in 1986 was awarded more than 250 
million in nobid contracts in four years it became the target of 
five state and federal criminal investigations 
four former wedtech executives pleaded guilty to bribe and 
theftrelated charges in january 1987 and have testified at several 
trials including a case that resulted in the conviction of rep 
mario biaggi dny on racketeering as owen held his sentencing 
hearing another jury in the same courthouse was deliberating in a 
wedtech case in which rep robert garcia dny and his wife are 
charged with conspiracy extortion and bribery 
wallachs lawyer gary naftalis urged the judge to sentence his 
client to community service he said wallach had devoted his life 
to helping various causes and was an excellent father 
wallach hired by wedtech as a consultant was found to have 
defrauded the company and its shareholders of 125000 in 1983 he 
billed that as work for the companys public stock offering but it 
actually was for his efforts to influence meese and others on 
behalf of the company 
he also was convicted of illegally receiving 300000 from 
wedtech officials purportedly for helping the company acquire 
shipyards and a michigan tugbarge system the jury found the money 
was actually a payment in anticipation of wallachs employment at 
the justice department where he could influence meese and other 
officials wallach never received a job at the justice department 
meese who has not been charged in the wedtech case was 
president reagans counsel before becoming us attorney general 
he resigned as attorney general in july 1988 and an internal 
justice department report later faulted him for his efforts to help 
wallach

a blind man who has been trying to join the 
state department for more than a decade will be granted his wish 
under the reversal of a policy that dates back to the 18th century 
avraham rabby of new york city said in a telephone interview 
monday he learned last friday that the state department had 
notified congress of its intention to hire qualified blind people 
for the career diplomatic service 
state department officials said the decision was based primarily 
on technological advances including optical scanners capable of 
speaking written words through a conversion process 
these advances enable the blind to improve efficiency and limit 
the need for readers and other types of outside assistance 
another factor contributing to the policy reversal was a federal 
law that states that the government cannot disqualify prospective 
employees persons because of blindness or other handicaps it must 
also provide reasonable accommodations to help them overcome 
their handicaps

a 20yearold student suspected of 
being a police spy was tortured and bludgeoned to death and six 
militant students were being held in connection with his murder 
police said today 
the body of sol injong was found sunday in the student council 
office at seouls yonsei university laid on a folding bed and 
wrapped in a brown blanket police said 
they said he had been tied to a chair tortured and beaten to 
death 
a police spokesman requesting anonymity in keeping with 
official practice said six students reported the killing and 
turned themselves in sunday after confessing to a roman catholic 
priest 
two of the six students allegedly administered the beatings 
police said 
korean newspapers called the killing shocking and senseless and 
blamed it on the ideological extremism of radical students 
the murder is a terrible lynching which cannot be forgiven 
said an editorial in todays donga ilbo newspaper 
the six students told police that they discovered sol carried a 
fake university identification card after he gained entrance to 
their radical student club and they suspected him of being a spy 
for the national security police a police spokesman said 
the six seized sol at the university library late saturday and 
took him to a club meeting room for interrogation police said the 
victims hands and legs were tied to a chair with nylon cord and he 
was beaten repeatedly police said 
the radicals claimed sol confessed he worked for the agency for 
national security planning and reported regularly on the activities 
of radicals at the university police said 
sol was identified as a secondyear student at tongyang 
engineering college in seoul 
there was no explanation as to why he carried yonsei university 
identification or joined the radicals club but police said a full

the united states is ready to offer technical 
help to promote soviet economic reform secretary of state james a 
baker iii said but he criticized moscow for disturbing actions 
around the world 
we want perestroika to succeed baker told the private 
foreign policy association on monday night in the bush 
administrations warmest statement of support so far for soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs attempts at economic social and 
political reform 
the soviets are entering very very uncharted waters 
experimenting with markets competitive enterprises and realistic 
pricing all of which we take for granted baker said 
washington stands ready to help moscow with advice on price 
reform and the development of a convertible currency baker said 
the soviets already have consulted top officials such as federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan and wayne angell a member of the 
feds board of governors in moscow on technical problems in 
reorganizing their economy 
but baker said there would be no free lunch for the soviets 
trade must be on a straight commercial basis 
baker denied that a more prosperous soviet union would be a more 
dangerous enemy he said perestroika gorbachevs economic 
restructuring really cant succeed without more freedom he 
said free speech human rights and the respect of law were 
essential for economic reform 
baker tempered his praise by charging that the soviets were 
reluctant to withdraw from regional conflicts 
he said soviet arms shipments to afghanistan and ethiopia were 
surging and had doubled in cambodia over last year 
these disturbing actions this seeming preference for military 
solutions may work in the short run to keep a najibullah or a hun 
sen or a mengistu in power baker said referring to the 
sovietbacked leaders of afghanistan cambodia and ethiopia 
in the long run however only political solutions based on 
national reconciliation can settle these conflicts he added 
baker said the soviets could save billions of dollars by cutting 
ties to regional clients 
despite the regional tensions baker said an historic 
opportunity exists for the superpowers to leave behind the ups 
and downs of the cold war 
the prospects for a lasting improvement in ussoviet 
relations are better than ever before he said citing soviet 
arms control measures designed to prevent war and gorbachevs 
promises to turn tanks into tractors 
baker also offered strong us support for reconciliation 
between the two germanies saying it was time for perestroika and 
glasnost to come to east germany 
he made it clear however that a reconciled germany should not 
be neutral or eastward leaning but with the people integrated 
into the community of democratic european nations on the basis of 
western values

opponents in a lawsuit that many believe could be 
used by the us supreme court to restrict abortions agreed to 
continue negotiations that could lead to a settlement and keep the 
case from the high court 
the talks were the first meetings between the parties since the 
high court decided in july to consider the case a lawsuit 
challenging an illinois law that regulates abortion clinics the 
plaintiff who runs an abortion clinic has prevailed at the trial 
and appeals court levels 
abortionrights supporters contend the standards make the 
clinics more expensive to operate thus pushing the price of 
abortion out of reach of poor women 
in springfield meanwhile a state legislative committee was 
scheduled to vote today whether a proposal to restrict abortions 
could be considered by the full assembly 
a recent draft of the bill would require doctors to determine 
the viability of a fetus 20 weeks old or older before performing an 
abortion and require that a second physician be present during 
abortions of viable fetuses it also would bar public employees and 
public facilities from direct involvement in abortions 
state attorney general neil hartigan and public health chief dr 
bernard turnock on monday met with american civil liberties union 
attorney colleen connell who represents clinic operator dr 
richard ragsdale 
none would comment on the substance of the talks but they said 
they agreed to meet again next week 
it is one of three cases scheduled for a supreme court hearing 
this term that antiabortion forces hope might be used to overturn 
roe vs wade the 1973 landmark ruling legalizing abortion 
hartigan who is defending illinois in the ragsdale case but who 
personally favors abortion rights said the settlement talks were 
intended to keep the case from the supreme court which is 
scheduled to hear arguments in december 
the attorney general a democrat who has announced his intention 
to run for governor next year said he opposes the idea of 
illinois being used as a football for a much broader decision 
i dont think theres any question that in fact this case 
might be used for something else hartigan told reporters 
monday

a high school wall mural of legendary 
rock guitarist and 1960s counterculture hero jimi hendrix has 
become an offensive symbol of drug abuse to a new generation of 
students 
nearly 100 ridgefield high school students have signed a 
petition aimed at painting over the mural of hendrix who died of a 
overdose of barbiturates in 1970 
it seems a little hypocritical to have a thing that is such a 
symbol of drugs said jonathan fulkerson a high school senior 
leading the petition drive to whitewash the mural 
i mentioned it to some people and they said dont bother 
with it or throw a can of paint on it but i thought that 
wouldnt be the right thing i thought id see if the 
administration feels the same way i do 
the 9yearold mural drawn from the cover a hendrix album 
titled crash landing shows him playing guitar as a robin 
flies toward him hendrix was known for searing guitar solos that 
became the hallmarks of songs like purple haze and foxy 
lady 
hendrix still has fans among the 1980s high school students 
fulkerson said that along with the signatures he has collected 
some harassment 
fulkerson said some students think the petition drive is 
goofy while others have used harsh language to express 
opposition one of his friends has been threatened with a knife he 
said 
fulkerson said he has no plans for something to replace the 
mural although a friend suggested using the space for an antidrug 
message 
student council president tony george said most students most do 
not understand why anyone would want the mural removed 
most people dont understand what all the fuss is about 
george said i can see why jon is circulating the petition but i 
dont really agree with it 
assistant principal joseph ellis said that if the students 
present a petition it will be reviewed he said that some students 
are creating a controversy where no controversy exists or should 
exist 
ellis said the mural should not be removed simply because 
hendrix took drugs and died of an overdose 
a number of kids have spoken to me about this and they dont 
look at him hendrix as a hero he said

south korea and an end to us demands for greater access to south 
korean markets

ambassadors residence on friday they hurled homemade bombs at 
guards and rampaged through greggs home with iron bars smashing

slurp on a sipper with a slogan 
and youve got your hands and lips firmly around a national fad 
the sipper a refillable plastic bottle with a drinking straw 
fitted into its cap originated as a handy nospill way for 
parched athletes to refresh themselves 
now the bottles are being toted by picnickers commuters and 
others who are helping sipper manufacturers suck up tall profits 
the harmony container co of san bernardino expects to produce 
20 million sippers his year bearing the names and logos of 
convenience stores fastfood restaurants and businesses 
the demand for sippers spread from the east coast to the west 
and now theyre pretty much in every nook and cranny said bret 
wilson harmonys sales manager he declined to disclose any 
financial details 
wilson says the promotional drinkware firm with offices in san 
bernardino and st louis noticed about 2 years ago that a squeeze 
bottle for sports looked a bit naked an empty billboard just 
waiting for an ad 
the sports bottle has been around for years for athletic 
activities we took the bottle out of the sports market and started 
putting catchy logos on it wilson said we brought it out of 
the hands of the sports market and put it in the hands of the 
promotional market 
although sports bottle producers generally have stayed out of 
the promotional end of the market wilson said competitors have 
sprung up in the east 
people are even making them in their garage he said the 
bottles have been especially hot items at convenience stores which 
give them catchy names such as main squeeze and often sell them 
as part of a deal at arcos ampm mini markets for instance the 
bottle is sold for 99 cents with the 49cent soft drink refills 
also go for 49 cents 
sippers also have proven to be popular items for sale at knotts 
berry farm in buena park where they carry the amusement parks 
logo and sell for 4 each 
it has been quite the rage said knotts spokesman robert 
deuel our purchasing manager told me that the constantly has to 
keep an eye on his stock because they move that many 
for companies its an inexpensive way to advertise wilson 
said and convenience stores and fastfood outlets are always 
looking for ways to increase fountain sales 
why the popularity among consumers 
i think that a lot of people like the sports appeal of it even 
if theyre not an athlete he said the bottle also fits in with 
a commuter society thats always on the move 
sipper popularity hasnt ebbed at knotts despite the passing of 
summer deuel said but wilson expects sipper sales to go into 
hibernation during the winter and then grow again next spring 
well see another big year but beyond that its hard to 
tell he said

sentencing for actress zsa zsa 
gabor was delayed for a week after her new attorney claimed she 
wasnt properly defended during her trial and the prosecution 
recommended 30 days in jail 
we have a miscarriage of justice new defense attorney 
harrison bull told municipal court judge charles rubin who earlier 
was sent the prosecution recommendation of 30 days in jail and more 
than 17000 in fines 
a jury convicted miss gabor on sept 29 of battery on a police 
officer driving without a valid drivers license and having an 
open container of alcohol in her car 
bull alleged that the trial attorney william graysen 
mishandled the assault case against miss gabor and violated canons 
of ethics 
we do know mr graysen directly solicited this client he 
guaranteed this client would not go to jail those two facts alone 
if proven would support a denial of due process bull said 
monday 
rubin granted a oneweek delay in sentencing but said he was 
not overwhelmed by bulls argument 
i feel there is a lot of grasping at straws here he said 
adding there was nothing to indicate misconduct by graysen 
rubin said there was no doubt in miss gabors mind that jail was 
a possibility if she was convicted throughout the trial the judge 
said she made some of the most incredible statements about 
incarceration 
the judge said he would not allow miss gabor to use dilatory 
tactics or grandstanding but he set the oct 24 date for 
sentencing and a motion for a new trial 
deputy district attorney elden fox disagreed with the defense 
argument 
i felt the matter should have referred to the defendants 
competence rather than counsels fox said the tenor of this 
motion appears to be sour grapes 
graysen said in an interview that he expects his defense to be 
upheld 
i wish her well i hope she gets a new trial and that she is 
vindicated he added 
the courtroom developments occurred after los angeles countys 
top prosecutor castigated the actress for mocking the judicial 
system 
she created this situation for herself with her celebrated 
mouth she made her bed and she can lie in it and thats at sybil 
brand district attorney ira reiner told reporters referring to 
the womens jail 
in addition to the jail term the prosecution sentencing 
memorandum sent to the judge sought more than 3000 in fines and 
14000 to compensate the beverly hills police department for its 
costs 
this is not some befuddled old lady reiner said shes as 
streetwise as anybody else 
miss gabor whose movies include moulin rouge queen of 
outer space boys night out and picture mommy dead was 
uncharacteristically quiet about reiners comments and the jail 
prospects 
i dont say anything miss gabor said by telephone from her 
belair home 
miss gabor could be sentenced to 18 months in jail for hitting 
officer paul kramer fox has said she will likely get some type of 
public service 
if she is given any form of community service it will be a 
farce preposterous an outrage said reiner insisting jail 
time was necessary to convince citizens that celebrities have no 
special privileges 
the tempestuous miss gabor slapped kramer on june 14 after he 
stopped her 215000 rollsroyce convertible the actress testified 
she instinctively struck out after kramer roughed her up

avraham rabby seemed to have all the attributes 
that make an ideal diplomat welleducated multilingual with a 
lifelong interest in international relations 
but he couldnt join the foreign service because hes blind 
now however the state department has reversed a policy dating 
from the 18th century that kept blind people out of the diplomatic 
corps rabby 47 of manhattan said monday the state department 
offered him an appointment friday after notifying congress of the 
change 
rabby had tried to join the foreign service since the ford 
administration and has passed required exams several times since 
1985 
the main problem is one of attitudes toward the blindness 
he said in any situation like that when youre trying to change 
attitudes sometimes it takes decades but eventually it has to 
come im very happy that its come now 
rabby planned to meet with his lawyer in washington today after 
testifying about his situation before a house subcommittee he 
expected to meet with state department officials soon to discuss 
what post he would receive 
department officials said they changed their policy toward the 
blind primarily because of technological advances such as optical 
scanners capable of converting and speaking written words 
another factor was a federal law barring the government from 
disqualifying prospective employees because of blindness or other 
handicaps it also must provide reasonable accommodations to 
help them overcome their handicaps 
the department previously insisted on a general exemption from 
this law because of the unique circumstances under which diplomats 
must work 
last november department officials agreed their policies were 
contradictory letting blind people take foreign service 
examinations but denying them jobs 
rabby has worked with the national federation of the blind for 
about 15 years to make the state department understand that 
discrimination doesnt make sense 
born in what is now israel and blind since age 8 rabby is a 
graduate of oxford university in england with degrees in spanish 
and french and has a masters degree in business administration 
from the university of chicago 
he is hoping eventually to become a political officer assigned 
somewhere like moscow london or tokyo 
some department officials have argued against hiring the blind 
contending that most foreign countries lack the facilities 
available in this country for helping the blind 
they also contended that much of diplomacy involves reading the 
body language of foreign envoys such gestures as winks and 
nods form part of the overall message a diplomat must assimilate 
the officials said 
the fact is that a lot of body language socalled body 
language you can hear as well as see rabby said particularly 
in negotiating situations the final decision is whats written on 
the page rather than someones nod of the head 
blind people serve already in all kinds of professional and 
upper management level positions rabby said sure there are 
problems that crop up that are blindnessrelated but there are 
ways to get around them

mikhail s gorbachev has rebuked the editor of 
ogonyok and other outspoken journalists accusing them of acting 
against the communist party or of seeking his political downfall 
soviet reporters said today 
the journalists said the soviet presidents leaders toughly 
worded accusations during a toplevel conference had sown great 
worry in their ranks that the sort of frank criticism spawned by 
the kremlins policy of glasnost or greater openness might again 
be ruled off limits 
if accounts of the meeting are accurate it would mark an 
aboutface for gorbachev who has permitted extraordinary criticism 
on a wide variety of topics while saying freedom of expression 
nonetheless has some so far illdefined limits 
the incident comes as soviet lawmakers are drafting a new law 
spelling out the rights and responsibilities of the soviet press 
the bill is scheduled to be submitted to parliament by the end of 
the month 
on friday gorbachev met at party headquarters in moscow with 
leaders from the countrys staterun mass media creative unions 
and agencies charged with formulating ideology to discuss 
consolidation of all forces of society for the successful 
realization of the tasks of perestroika tass said 
the meeting was attended by voting and nonvoting members of the 
ruling politburo and members of the party secretariat indicating 
the party leadership considered it a major policy session tass 
the official news agency said gorbachev gave a speech but 
official media have not distributed the text 
soviet journalists however said they were told by their bosses 
who attended that gorbachev tore into some of the brightest stars 
of soviet journalism and popular thought in the glasnost era 
including ogonyok weekly editorinchief vitaly korotich historian 
yuri afanasyev and reformist economists gavriil popov and nikolai 
shmelev 
the soviet leader accused afanasyev popov and shmelev of 
joining with maverick communist legislator boris n yeltsin to form 
a fascist clique striving for power said the journalists who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
gorbachev told the meeting that afanasyev the rector of moscow 
historical archives institute and an outspoken member of the soviet 
congress should be thrown out of the communist party the 
reporters said 
korotich was reportedly charged by gorbachev with violating the 
party line by permitting the publication in his trailblazing weekly 
of overly radical demands and criticism 
the reporters said that according to gorbachev korotich had 
begged him for mercy and promised to scale back his widely read 
weekly but he only kept that promise for a single issue gorbachev 
was reported to have told the gathering 
gorbachev also reportedly demanded that he been given all 
letters critical of him that had been sent to the weekly arguments 
and facts 
the tabloid newspaper using readers mail recently calculated 
that human rights activist andrei d sakharov was more popular than 
gorbachev or any other member of the congress of peoples deputies 
gorbachev complained that he had always supported the weekly 
which is printed by the znaniye national lecture society 
the editor of arguments and facts va starkov was given an 
additional dressingdown during a long meeting with chief party 
ideologist vadim a medvedev on monday the journalists reported 
gorbachev also reportedly called the editorial board of the 
moskovsky komsomolets newspaper a nest of informal antiparty 
organizations 
the paper is published by the komsomol young communist league in 
the soviet capital 
it was not immediately possible to obtain comment this morning 
from those gorbachev was said to have rebuked a colleague at the 
historical institute said afanasyev was on a business trip until 
oct 27 as were several of the editors involved 
however the communist party daily sovietskaya rossiya asked 
today that if afanasyev believes that the official ideology of 
marxismleninism is outmoded then isnt it more honest for him 
to leave the party

actor paul newman filed a 545 million suit 
against home box office inc claiming the cable television company 
undersold his film fort apache the bronx so it could rent out 
other hbo features 
ronald rosen newmans attorney said the actor signed with 
hbos subsidiary timelife productions to make the 1980 film 
about a veteran policeman in new york city 
the suit filed monday in federal court alleges breach of 
contract and antitrust violations it seeks 5 million in punitive 
damages and 450000 in alleged lost fees to the actor it also 
seeks an injunction against further blockbooking of fort 
apache 
newman was to receive 15 percent of domestic gross receipts and 
125 percent of overseas earnings under the contract rosen said 
in 1985 timelife productions licensed fort apache and 192 
other films to procter amp gamble co for 50 million rosen said 
the rental fee charged pampg for fort apache was 1 million 
he said arguing hbo used the film to coerce pampg into taking the 
other films a violation of antitrust laws newman maintained the 
films true value through licensing was 4 million 
hbo compelled pampg to artificially allocate a lower license fee 
to the film than was economically justified and artificially 
allocated higher license fees to the other 192 motion pictures in 
the group rosen said 
a call to hbos new york offices made after business hours 
monday went unanswered

hundreds of policemen went on a 24hour strike 
for higher pay in this violenceplagued capital and at least one 
man was reported killed in a shootout between strikers and a police 
patrol 
more than 300 policemen were detained by their colleagues on 
monday according to police sources they were being held at a 
police academy south of lima the sources said on condition of 
anonymity 
strikers clashed with officers leaving the downtown police 
headquarters to patrol the city they exchanged punches fired 
pistols into the air and lobbed tear gas grenades at one another 
according to reporters at the scene 
in a separate clash one man was reported killed and several 
wounded when strikers and working policemen exchanged gunfire it 
was not immediately clear whether the dead man was policeman or a 
bystander 
interior ministry spokesman fernando yovera said just 5 percent 
of limas policemen were on strike but the sources said as many as 
80 percent of lowerlevel officers were participating 
the strike which appeared limited to lima came as leftist 
rebels stepped up a violent campaign against the government and 
private citizens in an attempt to disrupt municipal elections set 
for nov 12 
on monday three masked men boarded a bus downtown forced the 
driver and passengers off at gunpoint then burned the bus 
yovera said police officers sympathetic to the procuba tupac 
amaru revolutionary movement were promoting the strike 
by midday several hundred onduty police troopers wearing ski 
masks that covered their faces and armed with automatic rifles 
ringed police headquarters and patrolled the city the ski masks 
were to prevent against reprisals from rebels or striking 
colleagues 
according to some reports 300 striking policemen occupied the 
police compound but yovera said onduty policemen were in control 
of the facility 
in a statement released to reporters strikers said they were 
demanding a fair salary to compensate for perus 3000 percent 
annual inflation and the dangers policemen face in peru 
they also want a 48hour work week instead of the current 56 
hours and overtime pay police earn base pay equivalent to about 
70 a month the minimum wage in peru is 40 a month 
hundreds of policemen have been killed by guerrillas of the 
maoinspired shining path a rebel movement that launched an armed 
insurgency in 1980 
the much smaller tupac amaru group took up arms in 1984 but in 
general has not made policemen a target of attacks 
in may 1987 policemen went on strike for four days and the 
government led by president alan garcia placed lima under military 
control to protect against guerrilla attacks

matter can be held together by intense 
light providing a potentially useful way to craft novel materials 
researchers said 
the scientists found they could organize randomly arranged 
microscopic beads into new structures that lasted as long as they 
were bathed in the intense light 
the practical applications of this observation are still 
unclear although experts said it could play a role in devising new 
methods of optical communications or in arranging molecules to make 
drugs and other products 
the study was carried out on tiny plastic beads just 143 
microns or 0000057 inch in diameter under the light they moved 
toward each other in hops of 0387 micron or 0000015 inch 
the spheres act like miniature antennas that pick up and then 
reradiate light said harvard physicist jene golovchenko this 
scattered light combines with that coming directly from the laser 
giving rise to force fields that bound the small spheres together 
in space the length and strength of the bonding are controlled by 
the intensity and wavelength of the laser light 
golovchenko conducted the research with michael burns and 
jeanmarc fournier of the rowland institute in cambridge it was 
published recently in physical review letters 
the researchers said that until now the only known way to bind 
matter was by atoms exchanging electrons the newly discovered 
process seems to work by exchanging packets of light known as 
photons 
the lightassembled structures fall apart as soon as the laser 
is switched off however golovchenko said that light might be used 
to align molecules in novel ways and then they could be made 
permanent by freezing or chemical processes 
the researchers observed the interaction by putting watersoaked 
beads between plates of glass and then shining a laser on them 
the spheres did a kind of dance hopping between bound 
states said golovchenko producing an interaction that he 
believed no one had witnessed before

a hospital has suspended use of more 
than 150 generic drugs because of the quality scandal in the 
industry a move one pharmaceutical group called the first of its 
kind in the nation 
officials of the hospital of st raphael said monday they would 
replace 60 percent to 80 percent of the generics the hospital uses 
with more expensive brandname drugs as precaution 
the food and drug administration is reviewing the 30 topselling 
generic drugs because some makers are accused of faking test 
results or bribing fda inspectors to win approval to market 
generics 
the allegations were so serious we couldnt in good conscience 
wait any longer said dr charles riordan st raphaels vice 
president for medical services 
the hospital will resume using the generic drugs which 
generally cost 50 percent to 70 percent less than brandname 
counterparts once officials are sure they have been adequately 
screened for quality riordan said 
the move was criticized as rash by jay molishever a spokesman 
for the new yorkbased generic pharmaceutical industry association 
he said the suspension was the first of its kind reported to the 
industry group 
this is an astounding action on the part of this hospital 
said molishever 
the hospital will continue using generics produced by the makers 
of brandname drugs and the products of three generic drug 
companies it has dealt with for many years said james j cullen 
chief operating officer of the 491bed teaching hospital 
we are not making a statement against the use of generic drugs 
en toto he said 
st raphaels will absorb the cost of the partial switch to 
brand name drugs estimated at 100000 a year cullen said 
however hospital officials expect to resume using at least some of 
the banned generics within the year he said 
the hospital will continue to use generics from three makers 
elkinssinn inc lyphomed inc and roxane laboratories inc 
because there hasnt been any indication of irregularities 
officials said 
st raphaels has stopped using 160 to 200 of the approximately 
250 generic drugs it stocks according to robert jacovino the 
hospitals pharmacy director

he drove through the town 300 miles north of new delhi which is 
home to most tibetan refugees living in india 
priests at a local church rang bells as the dalai lamas 
motorcade passed several western tourists watched displaying 
placards that read congratulations and welcome 
the tibetan governmentinexile declared today a public holiday 
and announced a public reception later in the day 
the dalai lama fled to india in 1959 after an abortive uprising 
against the chinese annexation of his remote himalayan nation 
since then he has continued to advocate nonviolence as the only 
means to achieve tibetan independence 
in recent months he has dropped demands for complete tibetan 
independence and has proposed that china retain responsibility for 
military and foreign policy 
beijing insists tibet has been an integral part of china since 
the 13th century the chinese government has said it will talk with 
the dalai lama if he renounces tibetan independence 
china has condemned the nobel award as an insult and 
interference in its internal affairs

a soviet legislative panel flexing its new 
muscles in the revamped supreme soviet rejected a government 
proposal on decentralizing economic control as not radical enough 
newspapers reported today 
the committee decided the government plan on taking away some 
economic powers from moscow and parceling them out to the countrys 
15 constituent republics does not reflect the radical changes in 
the soviet federation said the daily leninskoye zamya or 
lenins banner 
can we talk today about the widening of rights for the 
republics what we need is for each republic to be economically 
independent the deputy committee chairman valerian advadze was 
quoted as telling the supreme soviet on monday 
the legislative commission charged with fostering the economic 
development of the countrys republics and regions gave the council 
of ministers the government organ that presented the proposal 
until nov 15 to revise it 
the supreme soviet which gained new powers under president 
mikhail s gorbachevs overhaul of the communist partydominated 
political system has demonstrated growing confidence in its new 
role 
it voted down several candidates for ministerial posts proposed 
by the government and refused to follow gorbachevs lead when he 
called for a temporary ban on all strikes 
instead it prohibited strikes in several key sectors 
today the legislature took up a draft law on ownership that was 
billed as a measure intended to end the state monopoly on property 
in the soviet union

crews cleaned up after hurricane jerry 
which wielded a brief but deadly blow causing three deaths and as 
much as 825 million in damage 
as the weak hurricanes remnants slipped out of texas and into 
louisiana and arkansas on monday the gulf coast island city of 
about 62000 quickly returned to normal crews picked up downed 
power lines and trees and only one school was closed by a power 
failure 
weve had much more serious storms galveston mayor jan 
coggeshall said but for the people who did have damage it was 
very serious for them 
jerry a relatively small hurricane grew unexpectedly from a 
tropical storm to a hurricane early sunday and roared ashore later 
that night with winds gusting to 100 mph 
as it swept across galveston island jerry toppled trees and 
power lines tore off roofs and shattered windows in cars and 
homes the hurricane also spawned a halfdozen tornadoes in the 
area but damage generally was confined to roofs and power lines 
damage was estimated between 5 million and 825 million after 
ground and aerial surveys monday ms coggeshall said 
power was restored monday for most of about 75000 houston 
lighting amp power co customers who lost at the height of the storm 
the hurricane also churned up the houston ship channel 
crumpling four houston lighting amp power transmission towers built 
to withstand 90 mph winds customers were not seriously affected 
but downed wires halted traffic on the ship channel which likely 
would be closed until today utility spokeswoman geri konigsberg 
said 
three people were killed when a pickup apparently was swept off 
galvestons protective seawall sunday the bodies of a 26yearold 
coast guardsman and his 2yearold daughter were found sunday on 
the seawalls rock jetties the body of a 19yearold coast 
guardsman was found monday 
though jerry barely brushed louisiana it stirred up enough 
waves to eat away more of the delicate coastline of the barrier 
island and popular resort community of grand isle mayor andy 
valence said he would request federal and state help to build more 
jetties in vulnerable areas 
were so sensitive so vulnerable that when the water hits our 
very soft sand it just crumbles and disappears valence said 
he said high tides were only about 23 feet above normal but 
more than four feet of beach was eroded in some areas

a twomonthold speech by communist party chief 
jiang zemin published in full for the first time today reveals 
serious splits in the party despite its leaders efforts to appear 
unified 
jiang acknowledged that many party members supported the crushed 
prodemocracy movement and that some high officials still dont 
back the partys new hardline stance 
he called for a purge of these people whom he called 
opportunists and for an ideological struggle within the party to 
sweep out the dirt 
grasp the opportunity to do serious investigation and cleanup 
in order to protect party ranks he urged we must not pause 
or there will be trouble later 
jiang delivered the speech in august to a meeting of party 
organization officials but it was not reported in the official 
media until monday when the xinhua news agency carried brief 
excerpts 
the full text appeared today on the front pages of all national 
newspapers 
it is jiangs toughest statement since party elders selected him 
in june to replace ousted reformist zhao ziyang as party general 
secretary zhao was accused of supporting the spring studentled 
prodemocracy protests and splitting the party 
but jiangs speech revealed that despite repeated party calls 
for members to unify their thinking and unite around the party 
core serious disunity remains 
in this struggle even now there are some people who are 
watching jiang said watching what to see if there wil be 
change we cannot permit highranking officials to sit on the 
fence this is opportunism 
he said that all fencesitters with top jobs will be required to 
immediately make their stands clear and become very 
revolutionary or expect to be fired 
many moderate officials and zhao allies remain in government and 
party jobs and the belated publication of jiangs speech may 
signal that the hardliners have finally gathered enough strength 
to begin purging them 
so many party members took to the streets and marched this is 
a serious problem jiang said i read a bulletin that said a 
student party member wanted to march but the school party 
organization would not let him go he said i am a student first 
then a party member i must go such a party member is not 
qualified 
some party members left the party at its moment of danger 
imperiling the party i think we need not urge such members to 
stay it wont hurt us if we lose a group of them 
the prodemocracy movement was crushed june 4 when troops broke 
up demonstrations in central beijing killing hundreds of unarmed 
civilians 
jiang said the role of the party in workplaces should be 
strengthened 
if the party grassroots organizations are dissolved i think 
the party general secretary will become a commander in name only 
he warned 
he also said exploiters an old word for wealthy private 
businessmen should be barred from the party 
he said that one millionaire was allowed to join in recent 
years but our party is the vanguard of the working class if we 
allow those who dont want to abandon the principle of exploitation 
to join what kind of party will we wind up with 
apparently taking its cue from this speech the beijing city 
party committee voted over the weekend to bar wealthy businessmen 
from its ranks and to purge all unfit members

connoisseurs of american 
meatandpotatoes cuisine mourned as the original bobs big boy 
restaurant closed after 51 years 
the restaurant which served up its last big boy combo on 
monday will be demolished and replaced by a minimall 
ive eaten thousands of hamburgers here ive come here all my 
life said ben trigg 57 who remembered being at bobs when it 
opened in 1938 then he was a hungry 7yearold whose mother 
rewarded him with a hamburger and chocolate shake after clarinet 
lessons 
hey i grew up at this place said rodney herrick 41 i 
used to come here in my battleshipgray plymouth order a coke and 
fries and wait for girls hard to believe its closing down this 
place is a landmark 
among the mourners was the restaurants founder robert c wian 
75 
i feel perfectly lousy about it he said there is a lot 
of sentiment tied up in that place but its difficult to stand in 
the way of progress 
wian sold his car for 350 to buy the 10seat diner that became 
bobs big boy a few years later wian converted it into a drivein 
restaurant but kept the same meatandpotatoes menu a hamburger 
and a milk shake so thick you can eat it with a spoon cost 60 
cents 
the formula was a success wian eventually created a national 
restaurant chain that inspired numerous imitations 
on sunday and monday big boy customers paid their last respects 
by slipping into the brown vinyl upholstered booths and ordering 
their last big boy combo a double cheeseburger fries and a small 
salad drenched in blue cheese or thousand island dressing 
outside stood the chains mascot a largerthanlife statue of a 
chubby boy wearing suspenders that character wian remembers 
originally was sketched on a napkin by a customer drawing a picture 
of a boy wian had hired to clean counters 
wian created the doubledecker hamburger as a joke to satisfy a 
regular customers desire for something new and the idea caught on 
in 1967 wian sold the chain to marriott corp citing lackluster 
sales marriott decided six months ago to sell the original 
restaurant property to a shopping center developer 
the loss of the original bobs is only the beginning of the end 
of the sitdown burger and homecooking empire 
by 1991 all bobs big boys will have been converted into 
allies named for alice marriott the mother of marriott chairman 
and president jw marriott jr 
instead of doubledeck burgers fries and brownie hot fudge 
sundaes the menu will feature mexican dishes pasta salads and 
trendy sourdough 
as tribute to its past the glendale restaurant had a 
minimuseum near the front counter with bobs first spatula and 
menu enshrined in a glass case wian has asked that the museum 
artifacts be shipped to his newport beach home

i spent most of my life trying to get negro spelled with a 
capital n marshall told the sun of baltimore in a telephone 
interview monday by the time i got that done everyone was using 
black with a small b 
marshall 81 the first black on the supreme court said he had 
never gotten into the habit of using the word black preferring 
negro long after others had abandoned it 
the new york times today reported he referred to negroes in 
speaking from the bench last week while questioning a lawyer in a 
case concerning juries racial composition 
marshall conceded that the word black had sometimes 
slipped into opinions but i dont think black connotes 
anything he told the sun 
who is black ive only seen two black people in my life 
and they were both in africa 
marshall has now decided to use afroamerican which he 
calls the original phrase some black activists including the 
rev jesse jackson recently have advocated use of the term 
african american 
marshall used afroamerican for the first time monday in a 
sixpage dissent in a death penalty case 
asked by the times whether he expected the other supreme court 
justices to follow his lead marshall said i didnt ask anyone 
its everone on his own its like what the old lady said when she

a man who killed himself after fatally 
shooting his former lover and their two children hid a bomb on his 
body that could have blown up in the medical examiners office 
police said today 
the seveninch cardboard tube filled with gunpowder was attached 
to a push detonator said detective william brennan all it 
has to do is touch against something 
assistant medical examiner bennett g preston said he discovered 
the bomb as he started to remove clothes from the body of 
37yearold daniel wright who had shot himself in the neck after 
setting fire to his former lovers house 
i just reached in and pulled it out he said i thought it 
could be just about anything i said looks like weve got a 
bomb here we didnt mess with it 
the offices 65 employees were evacuated for two hours until the 
bomb squad removed the explosive 
about 12 hours later police called the bomb squad to remove 
unspecified military apparatus found in military lockers from 
the mans apartment brennan said 
police said wright confronted his exgirlfriend agnes rivera 
29 and several of her relatives in her home monday morning he set 
off several teargas canisters then began shooting wildly with a 
leveraction rifle 
ms rivera was fatally wounded in the chest while the relatives 
escaped out the front door police said wright then went into an 
upstairs bedroom where he shot his children ages 7 and 4 he 
apparently doused the room with a flammable liquid and ignited it 
then he shot himself and collapsed on the bodies of his 
children police said 
police said they had not determined a motive behind the attack 
but neighbors and relatives said there had been tension between 
wright and ms rivera 
he was always threatening her said a sobbing hector rivera 
who identified himself as ms riveras uncle he said if they 
would ever break up he would kill her 
the house sustained minor damage

fair weather and a new defense of sand 
spared south carolinas hurricanescarred beaches further damage 
from unusually high tides 
as the cleanup from hurricane hugo continued nearly a month 
after it struck there were these other developments 
officials on isle of palms asked a judge to postpone elections 
set for nov 7 
a spokesman for the national flood insurance program said 
12644 hugo flood claims filed in south carolina will represent the 
programs biggest payoff ever 
schools reopened monday for 44000 youngsters pupils built 
houses for displaced birds wrote essays and talked out their 
feelings about the storm 
a high tide of 73 feet arrived monday morning along beaches 
flattened by hugos 135 mph winds and 17foot tidal surge last 
month tides generally run between 5 and 6 feet along south 
carolinas coast 
it was a beautiful day and the ocean was just about flat at 
high tide said folly beach mayor bob linville forecasters had 
said the tides could further damage the beaches only if accompanied 
by stormdriven winds winds monday were only 7 mph under sunny 
skies 
the higherthannormal tides were caused by an alignment of the 
earth moon and sun that occurs about once a decade 
during the last two weeks crews have been pushing up mounds of 
sand along 40 miles of the hardesthit areas of the coast 
the berms on the beaches performed well they did exactly what 
they were intended to do said lt col jim scott an engineer 
with the army corps of engineers 
he said in some places the tides breached the berms but the 
water pooled harmlessly behind them 
at folly beach the tide gently washed over a temporary 
replacement road to about 200 homes on the islands east end as 
the tide receded the road was uncovered and traffic began using it 
again 
predicted high tides were to drop to 72 feet today and then 
recede the rest of the week 
on isle of palms mayor carmen r bunch and other officials 
asked a judge to postpone the election 
its unconscionable to politic on the island at this time 
said ms bunch who had not filed for reelection monday 
but critics of her administration which came under fire when 
it prevented residents from returning to the island while workers 
cleaned it up claim the delay would illegally extend the 
officials terms 
we have what is tantamount to maternal despotism over there 
said edward guerard who represented mayoral candidate wc walters 
at a preliminary hearing monday for the city to now say that the 
residents cant choose to throw them out is ludicrous 
the national flood insurance spokesman rick mayson said hugo 
flood claims will represent the biggest payoff in the history of 
the program he predicted some property owners would use the cash 
to move their buildings back from erosionprone beaches 
schools reopened monday but in charleston county some school 
buildings were so badly damaged they will remain closed for months 
during which classes will be held in neighboring schools

the 120 refugees a west german foreign ministry spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
the flight was scheduled in the evening to allow time for an 
additional group of east germans to be released from their 
citizenship diplomatic sources in warsaw said fortysix east 
germans were released from citizenship monday 
the flood of east germans to the west german embassy continued 
with about 200 people joining their countrymen since monday that 
brought the total at the compound or in nearby shelters to 1500 
a dispute was brewing between bonn and east berlin over the 
issuing of exit permits which the refugees need to leave poland 
east germany has said it will process 40 to 50 people a day 
hans klein the chief west german spokesman in bonn said his 
government had asked east germany to process larger groups of 
refugees but there was no immediate response from east berlin 
its obvious that the east germans do not want to have another 
spectacular passage of hundreds of refugees klein said he 
acknowledged that technical problems could limit the number of 
requests processed daily 
in warsaw east german ambassador juergen van zwoll said we 
are interested in speeding up this operation but this does not 
depend solely on us verification in the gdr east germany is 
necessary we cannot allow some murderer to leave for instance 
the exodus from poland is part of a larger flood of more than 
52000 east germans who have reached west germany since sept 10

the winner of the 1989 nobel prize for 
literature will be announced on thursday the awarding body said 
today 
the swedish academy a 203yearold institution created to 
safeguard the swedish language and literature will announce the 
winner from its 18thcentury headquarters in stockholms old town 
irish poet seamus heaney has been the only candidate tipped by 
the swedish media by the weekly vi magazine there was also 
speculation the prize might go to an east european writer 
the academy never discloses a list of nominees according to 
tradition it keeps the date of the nobel announcement secret until 
a few days before 
the literature prize is the last of six nobel prizes to be 
awarded this year the prize is worth about 463000 
the 1988 laureate was egyptian novelist naguib mahfouz the 
first arabiclanguage author to receive the prize since it was 
first awarded in 1901 
the award comes as the 18member academy has been distracted by 
the worst internal dispute in its history over its response 
earlier this year to the salman rushdie affair 
three members submitted letters of resignation but the academy 
whose members are chosen for life refused to accept them the 
three have boycotted the crucial meetings at which the prize is 
discussed and chosen 
the three protested the academys refusal to condemn the death 
sentence on rushdie issued by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
early this year khomeini said rushdie blasphemed islam in his book 
the satanic verses the british author has been in hiding ever 
since 
the academy issued a statement supporting freedom of speech but 
declined to go further in accordance with its code of avoiding 
political issues 
sture allen the academys secretary said the dispute did not 
interfere with the selection of this years laureate

pope john paul ii marked the 11th anniversary of his 
election as pontiff in fitting fashion winging home aboard a 
jetliner over the indian ocean and with lebanon and other 
destinations on his mind 
the mosttraveled pontiff returned monday from mauritius the 
last leg of an asian pilgrimage that was his 44th foreign tour 
since his election to the papacy oct 16 1978 
over 10 days the pope visited south korea indonesia and 
mauritius spending 58 hours in the air alone 
john paul turns 70 in may and showed signs of tiring on the 
asian tour especially under the wilting tropical sun his 
shoulders slumped at times as he clearly battled fatigue and jet 
lag 
but he was fresh and in good spirits when he briefly addressed 
reporters aboard the air mauritius boeing 767 taking him home and 
explained why he is a such a frequent flier having already covered 
some 424000 miles 
the pope recalled being asked by a seminarian in indonesia last 
week why he travels so extensively 
responding john paul quoted christ telling his apostles go 
teach all nations 
the pope said he was also carrying out the second vatican 
councils opening to the world part of the great reform of the 
roman catholic church in the 1960s launched by pope john xxiii 
john paul certainly doesnt go as a tourist having passed up a 
look at famed budhist and hindu temples in java on his indonesian 
swing and of the taj mahal when he visited india in 1985 
foremost in john pauls travel plans is lebanon although no 
date has been fixed 
he keeps thinking of a trip if that could help said 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro the consideration should be 
that it will bring results 
john paul has made a series of appeals to the moslem and 
christian communities for a lasting peace in the country torn by 14 
years of civil war 
polishborn john paul began his globetrotting after just three 
months in the papacy flying to mexico to address the bishops of 
latin america 
in the works for 1990 are two trips to africa where the 
catholic church is experiencing its fastest growth and another 
visit to mexico 
john paul began his latest tour with a flight for the first time 
over the soviet union which he hopes was a prelude to an actual 
visit 
this could be determined by his talks with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev at the vatican later this year

a judge who told a reporter he gave a lighter 
sentence to a killer because the victims were homosexuals asking 
for trouble thought the remarks were off the record his lawyers 
argued at a disciplinary hearing 
state district judge jack hampton confirmed however that after 
making the remarks in his chambers he told the newspaper reporter 
just spell my name right because no one will remember what ive 
said in 1990 
the confirmation was in a deposition presented at the hearing 
monday by bill hornung an attorney for the state commission on 
judicial conduct 
the commission has accused hampton of damaging public confidence 
in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary the panel could 
dismiss the allegations censure hampton or urge his removal by a 
sevenjudge tribunal 
the place the judge expresses his opinion should be from the 
bench not in an impromptu conversation with the press hornung 
said 
cliff hutchinson an attorney for hampton said dallas times 
herald courthouse reporter lori montgomery had been in hamptons 
chambers more than 100 times and did not make clear she would write 
a story about his dec 16 comments about the sentencing of murderer 
richard bednarski 18 
ms montgomery took advantage of the friendship she cultivated 
with judge hampton to write a slanted article about the judge 
hutchinson said 
i am not on trial here my work is not on trial what the 
judge said is the issue ms montgomery said after the hearing 
the judge knew i was conducting an interview on the record 
ms montgomery quoted hampton as saying he gave a 30yearprison 
term to bednarski and not a longer sentence in part because his 
two victims were queers the judge said they were asking for 
trouble based on testimony from bednarski that they were 
soliciting sex 
on the same day hamptons comments were published in the times 
herald he told the associated press the victims were 
homosexuals they were out in the homosexual area picking up 
teenage boys had they not been out there trying to spread aids 
around theyd still be alive today 
hampton a republican later apologized for a poor choice of 
words but has claimed the criticism is politically motivated he 
was out of town monday on a judicial retreat 
about 35 gayrights protesters stood outside the criminal courts 
building chanting slogans against hampton during mondays hearing 
retired judge robert r murray who presided over the hearing 
will submit a statement of facts within two weeks to the 11member 
commission

british and argentine diplomats held talks 
today aimed at restoring ties severed because of their 1982 war 
over the falkland islands 
the first round of the twoday talks was held at the suburban 
home of the british charge daffaires ivor roberts wednesdays 
session was to be held at the argentine embassy residence 
its too early to say much argentine ambassador lucio 
garcia del solar said at the end of the threehour morning session 
between fiveman delegations but i think its positive 
britains un representative and delegation head crispin 
tickell called the first meeting good interesting and 
businesslike 
todays were the first formal talks between the two countries 
since an initial encounter in bern switzerland in march 1984 
foundered on the question of sovereignty over the windswept 
archipelago in the south atlantic a british colony since 1892 
the madrid talks announced at the united nations aug 18 were 
made possible after president carlos menem of argentina agreed to 
drop the insistence of his predecessors that argentinas claim to 
what it calls the malvinas had to be the first issue considered in 
any discussion of normalization 
the agenda of the talks was not made public but they were 
expected to center on reestablishment of consular ties as well as 
air and sea links between the two countries severed because of the 
74day war which claimed nearly 1000 lives 
the argentines are also expected to seek an end to the 
britishimposed 150mile zone of exclusion around the 200odd 
islands that would permit argentine fishing boats to operate in the 
fishrich region which lies above the argentine continental shelf 
spanish diplomatic sources who are not directly involved in the 
talks said argentina would most probably call for a reduction in 
the 2000man british military contingent based in the falklands 
since the end of the war as a precondition to restoring consular 
relations 
indirect relations between the two countries have been handled 
through a british interests section at the swiss embassy in buenos 
aires and an argentine interests section in the brazilian embassy 
in london 
the spanish sources also described argentina as being more in 
a hurry than britain to come to an agreement because of the latin 
american nations pressing need to normalize economic relations 
with london and desire to establish closer ties with the 12member 
european economic community 
last week menem pardoned and freed the leaders of the military 
junta convicted and jailed under the government of former president 
raul alfonsin for their role in backing the april 2 1982 invasion 
of the islands that was eventually repelled by a british task force 
argentina surrendered on june 14 1982 but never made a formal 
declaration of cessation of hostilities 
del solar has said as far as he is concerned the hostilities are 
over and a formal declaration is not necessary because argentina 
and britain have been carrying on cordial relations since 
the majority of the 1800 residents of the islands whose 
economic mainstay is sheepraising are descendants of british 
sailors 
in 1964 the issue of sovereignty over the islands came before 
the un committee on colonization the following year the general 
assembly approved a resolution calling on britain and argentina to 
find a peaceful solution to the dispute 
argentine claims to the islands are based on the 1494 treaty of 
tordesillas by which spain and portugal settled conflicts over land 
claimed in the new world and on spanish possession to which 
argentina succeeded after declaring independence from spain in 1816 
british claims are based on continuous and effective occupation 
since 1833

a federal judge concluded that under a 
200yearold law vietnamese fishermen living in the united states 
are poachers if they dont have us citizenship 
the citizenship law requires commercial fishing boat owners and 
captains to be us citizens 
alan sparer a lawyer for the vietnamese fishermens association 
and six individual fishermen who challenged the law said he would 
appeal 
he said 30 to 100 boat owners in northern california would be 
put out of work under the ruling along with their crews 
the vietnamese refugees have been granted permanent residence in 
the united states while applying for citizenship a process that 
can take seven years they insist they compete very little with the 
rest of the fishing industry 
the vietnamese said many were forced to stop fishing and some 
were threatened with confiscation of their boats when the coast 
guard after years of nonenforcement started enforcing the law 
last november and fining them up to 500 
they obtained a temporary restraining order against the law 
sept 27 arguing that the citizenship requirement passed in the 
postrevolutionary war period to protect the fledgling us fishing 
fleet unconstitutionally deprived resident aliens of their right 
to pursue their occupation 
but us district judge william schwarzer ruled monday that he 
had no choice but to find that the vietnamese fishermen had no 
chance of ultimately proving the law unconstitutional 
they have been poaching he said 
the judge said congress out of concern for national security 
and domestic commerce had the authority to pass the law 
he also said the vietnamese had been warned about enforcement 
for up to five years 
its not as if the government has suddenly jumped in and come 
down with its ax without warning the judge said what these 
people have been doing has been unlawful all the time they have 
been able to build up a business because of limited enforcement

the world body controlling wildlife 
trade formally banned ivory sales today despite bitter objections 
from southern african countries which insist their elephant herds 
are not endangered 
a 91nation plenary session of the convention on trade in 
endangered species or cites approved without vote a compromise 
proposal that places elephants on the endangered list but also 
creates a panel of experts to consider exemptions 
objecting nations have three months to file reservations that 
means they would be allowed to sell ivory to other cites countries 
who file reservations or to more than 60 noncites members 
zimbabwe took the hardest stand against the ban and said it 
might withdraw completely from the convention 
withdrawing would hurt us a lot said rowan martin 
director of research in zimbabwes park and wildlife department 
but it shows how much this means to us 
south african delegate johannes neethling said the vote punished 
those countries that successfully managed their wildlife and 
maintained stable elephant herds he said he expected his 
government to file a reservation 
earlier botswana malawi and mozambique said they also would 
file reservations they claim they need the proceeds from ivory 
sales to maintain successful conservation 
they were joined by burundi which has no elephants left but has 
a stockpile of 86 tons of suspect ivory 
ivory from elephant tusks is highly valued for its use in the 
signature stamps popular in many asian nations and for jewelry 
piano keys and carvings 
the plenary session followed a committee vote where the 
compromise formula proposed by somalia received the required 
twothirds majority 
under the new measure countries may be granted exemptions from 
the ban if they can prove to a special panel of experts that they 
maintain stable elephant populations 
countries granted exemptions would be allowed to resume limited 
ivory trade but no exemptions are likely to be considered before 
the next conference of cites in 1991 
the meeting which ends friday also is considering about 300 
other emdangered animals and plants but the focus was on the 
african elephant after a continentwide census suggested the 
elephant population had declined from 13 million to less than 
650000 in the past decade

el salvadors conservative government 
and leftist rebels opened talks on ending the countrys 10yearold 
civil war and immediately reached a deadlock as each side rejected 
the others first proposal 
joaquin villalobos a leader of the rebel farabundo national 
liberation front said the governments offer amounted to no more 
than a call for unconditional surrender 
justice minister oscar santamaria who is heading the government 
delegation for the talks that are to last through today called the 
proposal serious and responsible 
the rebels proposed a series of military economic political 
and legal reforms directed toward achieving peace and democracy 
a source close to the rebels said today the proposal includes 
removal of top military chiefs who are directing the war they 
include defense minister gen humberto larios gen juan rafael 
bustillo the air force commander and numerous brigade commanders 
a copy of the government offer obtained by the associated press 
calls for the rebels to cease hostilities by wednesday demobilize 
immediately and organize to participate in elections and the 
countrys political life 
the proposal promises only to halt military operations without 
prejudice that the armed forces carry out their constitutional 
duties 
it implicitly rejects a rebel proposal for a ceasefire in 
exchange for a government promise to undertake wide political and 
social reforms purge the armed forces of rightist officers and 
negotiate a permanent end to hostilities 
basically the government proposal is to stop the fighting 
without basis or discussion simply silence the guns this is an 
absurd illogical and inflexible scheme villalobos said 
government spokesman juan martinez varela denied the offer was 
merely a scheme to get the rebels to lay down their weapons we 
are not asking anyone to surrender he said but refused to 
answer further questions 
this was the second round of talks between the two sides since 
president alfredo cristiani took office in june for a fiveyear 
term 
three separate peace meetings from 1984 to 1987 with his 
predecessor former president jose napoleon duarte also ended in 
deadlock for similar reasons 
this time however both sides appeared eager for an early 
ceasefire in the war that has cost more than 70000 lives most of 
them civilian 
in last months first round in mexico city with roman catholic 
church leaders acting as mediators the two sides agreed to talks 
at 30day intervals after this round until a peace accord is 
reached 
president oscar arias of costa rica who won the 1987 nobel 
peace prize for his efforts to achieve peace in central america 
opened mondays meeting at a roman catholic parish house in 
moravia a town six miles northeast of san jose 
i know that you are going to want to bury that past because 
you dont want to be leaving here accomplices in the continuation 
of the war the pain the tears and the death he said 
attending as witnesses on monday were salvadoran catholic 
bishops gregorio rosa chavez and marcos rene revelo and the 
secretary of the papal nuncios office in san jose monsignor

an israeli military investigation urged that a 
colonel in charge of air defenses be reprimanded over his failure 
to detect a fighter jet that a defector flew over the border from 
syria last week 
the israeli army said monday that investigators had concluded a 
faulty report and mistaken decisionmaking process in the air 
force led to the failure to intercept the sovietmade mig23 
fighter jet 
the oct 11 flight into northern israel caused an uproar here 
over possible flaws in the air defense system along the border with 
syria 
the military team recommended that the colonel who directed air 
defenses at the time of the defection be reprimanded the officer 
was not identified 
military officials said the air force also was expected to 
update its standing orders and procedures related to air 
infiltrations 
one question not answered by the army probe was why the pilot 
maj mohammed bassam adel spent 20 minutes on the ground with no 
security officials around after landing at megiddo a few minutes 
flight from haifa a port city of 250000 
adel 34 was on a training flight over southern syria when he 
flew into israel and landed at an airstrip used by cropdusting 
planes he said he defected in search of freedom and democracy 
also monday a beirut newspaper reported that israels secret 
service used a druse woman to lure the syrian air force pilot who 
flew the jet 
addiyar a conservative daily based in christian east beirut 
said in an unsourced frontpage report that a druse woman whom it 
did not identify confessed following her arrest that she had been 
recruited by israeli intelligence 
addiyar said israel had been interested in gaining direct 
information from a syrian pilot flying a mig23 syria and israel 
have been in a state of war since israels creation in 1948

president bush will veto a bill allowing 
federally financed abortions in cases of rape and incest after 
giving up efforts to find a compromise his spokesman said today 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the provision 
part of a spending bill already approved by a housesenate 
conference committee and the full house would be vetoed once it 
wins final senate approval 
the white house previously had hinted that a veto was likely 
today fitzwater said it flatly 
the white house abandoned the bid for a compromise after chief 
of staff john sununu met for a second day monday with leading 
antiabortion congressmen 
we talked to people on all sides of the issue we couldnt 
find any flexibility fitzwater said today 
bush earlier had threatened to veto legislation expanding 
current law but last week he said he was seeking room for 
flexibility to avert a veto 
im not looking for any conflict over this he said friday 
im not going to change my position any but lets see how those 
negotiations come out 
congressional democratic leaders have already conceded they do 
not have enough votes to override a veto of the measure which has 
already passed the house 
the efforts to reach a compromise were never given much of a 
chance by abortion rights supporters who won a surprise victory 
last week in the house and expressed no willingness to yield their 
position 
fitzwater acknowledged as much after sununu met with reps vin 
weber rminn christopher smith rnj and henry hyde rill 
just as he did on friday 
i dont think really there was ever much opportunity to get 
close fitzwater said he said senior advisers to the 
president have recommended a veto 
abortion rights supporters warned that a veto will hurt the 
republican party in the context of what some believe is a changing 
political climate on the issue 
if he vetos it it hurts him sen robert packwood rore 
said earlier monday it hurts our party it hurts our 
candidates 
packwood said a veto could particularly damage gop candidates 
for governor in virginia and new jersey two states with races this 
fall in which the abortion issue has been successfully used by 
democrats who back abortion rights against antiabortion 
republicans 
hes misjudged badly the sentiment of the public on the issue 
of choice kate michelman head of the national abortion rights 
action league said earlier monday hes going to have to take 
his lumps 
the language dropping a 10yearold ban on the use of federal 
money for abortions by poor women in cases of rape and incest is 
included in a 1567 billion appropriations bill for the labor and 
health and human services departments current law allows medicaid 
abortions only when the mothers life is in danger 
the bill next goes to the senate for agreement on a separate 
provision 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he did not 
know when the bill would come to the floor senate sources said 
republicans are holding up the bill while they decide on their next 
move and they have told democrats to expect an attempt to add an 
amendment 
fitzwater said the talks seeking a compromise included 
suggestions that bush sign the legislation while announcing 
government regulations requiring stricter reporting requirements 
those requirements would be aimed at preventing women from later 
claiming they had been victims of rape or incest merely as a way of 
obtaining a federally paid abortion 
some attempts at compromise centered on defining the time limit 
required for reporting rape or incest by the victims seeking an 
abortion the bill only says the victim must promptly report 
the rape or incest to authorities 
abortion rights leaders rejected a gop proposal to set a 48hour 
time limit 
mitchell and house speaker thomas s foley dwash last week 
pleaded with bush not to veto the legislation which they said 
affected the most vulnerable american women 
gary bauer president of the conservative family research 
council and a former policy adviser in the reagan administration 
predicted that following a veto conservatives would try to work 
out something that wouldnt give the righttolife people 
heartburn and at the same time allow the prochoice groups to claim 
some progress

a day after thousands of prodemocracy activists 
took to the streets in several cities east germanys communist 
party today promised an atmosphere of openness to discuss 
critical issues 
the ruling politburo facing mounting unrest at home was 
scheduled to hold its regular weekly meeting late today amid 
speculation it could determine the political future of hardline 
leader erich honecker 
neues deutschland the party newspaper pointed out in a 
commentary that in recent days it had dealt with many critical 
questions constructive suggestions and new starting points 
but the paper emphasized the countrys communist system will 
stay firmly in place and it left out the growing prodemocracy 
opposition movement from a list of discussion partners about 
possible reforms 
everything should be discussed openly with the exception of 
socialism on german soil the newspaper cautioned its readers 
we are doing this in a matteroffact dialogue and in trusting 
cooperation in an atmosphere of openness honesty and a realistic 
estimate of the powers and possibilities the newspaper said 
opposition leaders say they are in favor of democratic 
socialism implementing free elections but also preserving many 
of socialisms benefits such as guaranteed jobs and free medical 
care 
mondays nights march in leipzig the largest single protest in 
the nations 40year history put new pressure on the government to 
consider reforms 
for the first time east germanys staterun television promptly 
reported the protest saying tens of thousands of citizens took 
part 
christoph wonneberger the pastor of st lukes lutheran church 
in leipzig told west germanys zdf television that more than 
120000 people participated in the threehour march 
in other protests monday night 10000 people marched through 
downtown dresden and about 3000 people gathered in an east berlin 
church for a prodemocracy vigil activists said west germanys 
ard television network said today that thousands also marched 
monday night in magdeburg plauen and halle 
protesters in leipzig carried placards demanding freedom of the 
press and free elections they chanted power to the young 
people and erich lead reforms or go to a retirement home 
there were reports of scuffles when security forces attempted to 
grab banners away from marchers but no reports of arrests 
more than 70000 protesters marched unhindered in leipzig on

pressure has mounted on the aging hardline leadership in east 
berlin as unrest spreads there has been a seemingly endless exodus 
of tens of thousands of refugees to the west in recent weeks 
early this month east germany began to be hit by street 
protests that have been the most serious since 1953 when soviet 
tanks helped put down a workers revolt the new protests were 
stirred in part by the anniversary celebrations and the mass 
emigration of young skilled workers disillusioned by the system 
most protesters are young and they insist they want to reform 
east germany rather than flee to the west 
more than 52000 east germans have fled westward since late 
july either over hungarys open border with austria or after 
seeking refuge in west germanys embassies in warsaw poland and

the oil and auto industries seeking to 
influence the outcome of congress debate over alternative motor 
fuels today announced a joint program to test the 
pollutioncutting benefits of gasoline against methanol 
keith mchenry senior vice president of technology at amoco 
corp said the 11 million testing program would provide an 
objective assessment of the relative air quality benefits to be 
derived from methanol and new formulations of gasoline 
the joint program involving the big three auto companies and 
the 14 largest oil companies is to begin immediately a report on 
findings is due by next july or august 
mchenry said too little was known at present about the 
emissionreduction potential of methanol and reformulated gasoline 
for congress and the states to make good decisions on policies 
aimed at curbing smog caused largely by burning fossil fuels 
the american petroleum institute the trade organization of the 
major oil companies has vigorously lobbied against methanol and 
touted the advantages of gasoline 
mchenry asserted however that the joint study would have no 
bias 
we have made no preconceived notions about how our data will 
turn out he told a news conference 
the oil companies have sought to defeat a provision in president 
bushs proposed amendments to the clean air act that would require 
the auto companies to make vehicles that run on fuels other than 
gasoline and for the alternative fuels to be available for use by 
motorists in the most polluted urban areas by 1995 
the alternative fuel favored by the administration is methanol 
which currently is not in commercial production the oil industry 
which sells about 100 billion gallons of gasoline yearly has 
raised safety economic and environmental questions about methanol 
a form of alcohol 
mchenry said senior executives of amoco and general motors corp 
met with white house chief of staff john sununu to inform him of 
the joint study but he said there was no discussion of the 
political aspects of alternative fuels 
he said sounds like a good program go ahead and do it 
weve very interested in the results mchenry quoted sununu as 
saying 
mchenry said the oil companies and automakers hoped their test 
results would be available before congress passes cleanair 
legislation 
the testing procedures and results are to be reviewed by an 
independent advisory committee composed of academic specialists and 
federal and state agencies mchenry said adding that this would 
ensure the outcome was not biased

a federal judge was gunned down today as 
he waited on a medellin street corner for a ride to work and an 
anonymous caller said drug traffickers killed him in retaliation 
for extraditions to the united states 
courts reportedly were paralyzed in medellin after the slaying 
shocked judges conferred with each other and a union encompassing 
all colombias judges and court employees considered a strike for 
better security 
police said judge hector jimenez rodriguez was shot six times by 
a passenger on a motorcycle 
the gunman got off the motorcycle walked up to jimenez and shot 
him the colombian radio chain caracol quoted witnesses as saying 
in medellin the base of the countrys most notorious cocaine 
cartel 
an anonymous caller to caracol said the judge was slain by the 
extraditables a group of suspected drug traffickers being hunted 
for extradition to the united states 
the government of president virgilio barco has extradited four 
colombians to the united states including three last saturday 
since a crackdown on drug trafficking began aug 19 
the extraditables said in a communique soon after the 
crackdown began that they would kill 10 judges for every colombian 
extradited jimenez was the first judge killed since the drug sweep 
started it was not immediately known if jimenez had been involved 
in any recent extradition cases 
there are varying figures on the number of judges that have been 
killed in colombia but the justice ministry says that about 50 
judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed since 1982 
the association of judicial employees says 1600 of colombias 
5000 judges have been threatened with death in the last 12 months 
the court workers union held an emergency meeting in bogota to 
decide whether to ask members to strike for better security an 
executive with the union told the associated press 
court activity in medellin came to a standstill as judges met 
behind closed doors to decide what to do the union executive said 
he asked to remain anonymous so he would not become a target of 
drug traffickers 
meanwhile the newspaper vanguardia liberal of bucaramanga 
heavily damaged by a bomb on monday hit the streets with a 16page 
edition today the newspaper had joined in a condemnation of 
cocaine barons

children in child care centers are in jeopardy 
because povertylevel wages have fueled an alarming rate of 
turnover of trained teachers according to a study released today 
the national child care staffing study found that teachers are 
earning an average hourly wage of 535 which provides an annual 
income of 9363 for fulltime employment the 1988 poverty 
threshold for a family of three the average family size in the 
sample was 9431 a year 
the study said almost threequarters of the child care teachers 
in the study had some college background but earned less than half 
as much as comparably educated women and less than onethird as 
much as comparably educated men in the work force 
these low wages are fueling an alarming rate of turnover 
said marcy whitebook head of the child care employee project and 
principal investigator of the study she said staff turnover jumped 
from 15 percent in 1977 to 41 percent last year nearly tripled in 
the last decade 
instead of centers that promote healthy child development we 
are confronted by programs where children dont know who will be 
caring for them from day to day where they are isolated from 
peers where they lack language competence and miss critical social 
development said rep george miller chairman of the house 
select committee on children youth and families 
the house early this month approved a 227 billion child care 
package that miller said addresses the problems of salary and 
training now lawmakers are working out differences between the 
house version and one passed by the senate earlier this year 
deborah phillips assistant psychology professor at the 
university of virginia and a project investigator said 227 child 
care centers in atlanta boston detroit phoenix and seattle were 
examined between february and august 1988 the centers served a 
total of more than 16000 families including 53 infants 97 
toddlers and 110 preschoolers and employed more than 3000 staff 
our study raises serious concerns about the quality of care in 
america she said the typical classroom in centers had barely 
adequate quality ratings better quality centers had higher wages 
for teaching staff lower teaching staff turnover better educated 
and trained staff and more teachers caring for fewer children 
other observations said ms phillips were that better quality 
centers were more likely to be nonprofit and that low and 
highincome children were more likely than middleincome children 
to attend centers providing higher quality care 
ms phillips explained that day care for lowincome families 
oftentimes is subsidized by the federal government while 
middleincome families must personally pay for the entire expense 
carollee howes professor at the university of california at los 
angeles said the study recommended that child care teacher 
salaries be increased to recruit and retain qualified workers and 
that formal education and training be promoted she said staff 
training should be adopted at both the federal and state levels 
the study funded with 500000 by a consortium of foundations 
including the ford foundation and the foundation for child 
development was endorsed by a number of organizations 
we have known for far too long that the staffing crisis is 
strangling the supply and quality of early childhood programs 
said barbara willer of the national association for the education 
of young children the staffing study dramatically supports the 
adage you get what you pay for

the soviet union today ended a sevenyear 
effort to expel israel from the general assembly and abstained from 
a vote to reject israels credentials israel was seated by a vote 
of 9537 with 15 abstentions 
it was the first time since 1982 when moslem nations first 
tried to oust israel that the soviet union did not vote against 
the jewish state 
last years vote was 9541 with seven abstentions in the 
159nation general assembly 
speculation had centered on whether the soviet union would 
change its vote and end opposition to israels presence in a sign 
of warming sovietisraeli relations and better ussoviet ties 
israeli diplomats had said the soviet vote would be a test of 
its intentions in improving relations with israel and playing a 
significant role in the middle east peace process 
general assembly resolutions are not binding and a vote of the 
15nation security council is required to expel a nation or admit a 
new member the assembly by refusing to accept credentials can 
bar a nation from participating in the work of the assembly as in 
the case of south africa 
for the past seven years arab nations have sought to expel 
israel claiming it is an international outlaw and defies un 
resolutions calling on it to withdraw from occupied arab lands 
israel occupied land from egypt jordan and syria in the 1967 
middle east war 
the soviet union broke diplomatic relations with israel during 
the 1967 war but both sides have been improving unofficial 
contacts

the fiveday exhibition down from about 260 firms from more than 
20 countries at the last one in 1987

are political uncertainties its difficult for companies to get 
funds said an official of one us company business prospects

and mediumsize airliners from 93 domestic airports and plans to 
buy 90 jetliners in the next five years providing major

a group of roman catholic nuns gave up their legal 
battle to save their salmonellainfected chicken flock tuesday 
following a dispute in which they had locked themselves inside the 
coop 
the mother superior at our lady of passion monastery sister 
catherine conceded the chickens must die a high court is 
preparing to return its decision on the ministry of agricultures 
order to slaughter the birds 
we have just had the ground completely cut out from under our 
feet sister catherine said but we really accomplished what we 
wanted which was to show that its just a political thing 
the nuns would have had to prove that the decision by minister 
of agriculture john gummer was unreasonable or irrational and 
their attorney alan rawley said the nuns agreed that they could 
not meet that test 
gummer said the 5000 laying hens would be destroyed as soon as 
possible 
the nuns at our lady of passion monastery in the central 
england town of daventry 70 miles north of london challenged the 
ministrys order to destroy the egglaying chickens after tests 
revealed they carried salmonella 
a high court judge had granted a reprieve when sister catherine 
an 82yearold native of kentucky led a sitin at the henhouse to 
keep out health inspectors and ministry officials 
the agriculture ministry said tests conducted by the public 
health laboratory showed the hens were infected with the same type 
and strain of salmonella involved in a july food poisoning outbreak 
traced to the nuns flock 
the nuns said the tests were improperly conducted and that their 
eggs posed no health threat 
the government authorized its veterinarians to close 
eggproducing plants and slaughter chickens after a food poisoning 
scare earlier this year involving salmonella in eggs 
sister catherine said the nuns had been told by the ministry 
that the presence of salmonella meant an end to egg producing she 
estimated the total loss of income at around 32000 a year 
the british egg producers association which is meeting the 
nuns legal costs said it was pleased that the high court had 
ruled the nuns would be paid the full market price for each of the 
slaughtered birds 
the nuns who will be allowed to keep one flock of 5000 birds 
said their next venture will be making chocolate

television cameras recorded the proceedings of the 
house of commons for the first time on tuesday as legislators 
returned to work from their summer break 
but the taping by the eight remotecontrolled cameras was only a 
dress rehearsal to be seen only by legislators and tv program 
planners the nations tv viewers wont get to see the lawmakers 
until nov 21 with the official opening of a new session of 
parliament 
deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe standing in for prime 
minister margaret thatcher who is at the commonwealth conference in 
kuala lumpur was one of the first commons politicians to be 
recorded by the cameras as he responded for the government at 
tuesdays question time 
at the end of the experimental period next summer the 
legislators in the 650seat commons will vote on whether to permit 
regular tv screening of their proceedings or ban the cameras 
the house of lords the more sedate unelected upper chamber of 
parliament has permitted televising of its proceedings since 
january 1985 and viewers have occasionally glimpsed a peer of the 
realm soundly asleep 
but the often rowdy commons had always refused to admit the tv 
cameras until a decision in february 1988 when legislators voted 
318264 to let in the cameras for an experimental period 
the commons admitted microphones for radio broadcasts in 1978 
its refusal to let in tv cameras separated it from other 
legislatures around the world which have allowed such coverage for 
years 
hoping to discourage rowdy scenes and exhibitionism among 
legislators the house has laid down strict rules about what 
broadcast communications the company in charge of the cameras can 
and cannot show 
if there is a noisy disruption in the commons as there often 
is either among legislators on the floor of the house or among 
demonstrators in the public gallery the camera operators have 
strict orders to ignore it and focus only on the speaker bernard 
weatherill 
the cameras will give headandshoulders shots of individual 
legislators as they speak reaction shots are forbidden unless the 
person is specifically mentioned by the legislator who is speaking 
panning shots of mrs thatcher opposition labor leader neil 
kinnock and their senior colleagues on the front benches nearest 
the speaker are also banned wideangle shots of the chamber must 
be used sparingly 
conservative legislator david harris a member of the houses 
select committee on televising the commons said the guidelines 
might need to be modified we all need to learn he said 
labor legislator frank dobson said i think that some of our 
customs may appear silly and bizarre and i think if they appear 
very silly and very bizarre we will be under pressure to adjust 
what we do

headlines in official newspapers tuesday 
proclaimed impressive results after two months the sweep up 
pornography campaign has netted 30 million books and magazines 
but on inside pages several newspapers revealed the details of 
how the campaign backfired in some cases increasing sales of 
pornographic books and spreading them among children 
it seems that in many cities each work unit was given a quota 
for turning in pornographic material bosses gave their workers 
orders bring in one dirty book apiece 
even elementary schools were given quotas and they sent their 
pupils home to rummage through shelves and cupboards for yellow 
literature the chinese phrase for pornography 
such orders are not unusual chinese children are accustomed to 
bringing in dead rats during antirat campaigns and the masses have 
met quotas for killing mosquitoes and swallows 
but this assignment caused unusual confusion economic reference 
news said some students took the order literally and came back with 
books printed on yellow paper others grabbed calendars with 
pictures of female movie stars or any magazine that had a womans 
picture on the cover 
some parents complained that they didnt have any pornography 
but teachers told them to bring in something anything for the 
count the paper said 
the newspaper described the assignment as preposterous 
a reader who wrote to china youth news agreed students at the 
middle school in her hometown in eastern chinas jiangxi province 
were ordered to bring in two yellow books apiece 
parents didnt know whether to laugh or cry wrote long 
ximiao some parents asked their children to go to the street and 
buy pornographic books at high prices there were so many people 
buying pornographic books that the supply fell short of demand and 
the prices went up several times each day 
the book sellers were very happy to earn so much money long 
wrote the children exchanged the books and read them with 
curiosity before they handed them in it was the talk of the town 
for a while 
other problems developed in dengzhou city in central chinas 
henan province a reader reported in a letter to the peasants 
daily he said so many people were drafted into sweeping up 
pornography teams that their quality was not too high and 
team members were found to be hoarding the confiscated books for 
their own use 
some even resold them the reader said creating new outlets for 
yellow literature 
no such discouraging details have made it into the frontpage 
reports the peoples daily praised regional party committees for 
taking a leading role in the campaign and singled out several 
provincial party chiefs who personally directed investigations in 
their provinces worst districts 
it said coastal provinces have clamped down on imports of 
pornographic material 
official speeches have given the impression that most 
pornography comes from outside li ruihuan the top party leader in 
charge of literature and the arts said in a speech published over 
the weekend that foreign hostile forces were trying to spread 
pornography gambling and drugs inside china to poison the minds of 
its citizens and push china toward capitalism 
printing or selling pornographic material is punishable with a 
threeyear prison term but the law does not define pornography

voters picking a successor to the late 
us rep larkin smith decided today whether to keep the seat in 
gop hands or give the democrats mississippis entire house 
delegation for the first time in 17 years 
republican tom anderson 43 longtime chief of staff to us 
sen trent lott faced democrat gene taylor a 36yearold state 
senator in a highstakes campaign to fill the seat left vacant by 
smith death in a plane crash aug 13 
lott had held the seat for the republicans for 16 years before 
he went on to the senate smith defeated taylor for the post last 
year 
the district in the southeastern corner of the state includes 
the gulf coast and the cities of biloxi gulfport and hattiesburg 
the gop has shown the importance they place on the seat in the 
amount of money anderson has spent a campaign appearance by 
president bush and lotts visibility anderson spent about 500000 
roughly five times what taylor has spent 
that district is important to us not because it has been in 
republican hands for so long said state democratic chairman ed 
cole thats one of the reasons 
but that district represents the best of what mississippi has 
to offer in that it has the strongest economy the highest per 
capita income the highest technology base and the greatest 
population growth in the last 10 years 
a taylor victory would give democrats all five of mississippis 
congressional seats for the first time since 1972 republicans hold 
both senate seats 
in the primary oct 3 taylor got 42 percent of the vote and 
anderson 37 percent to advance to todays runoff attorney general 
mike moore a democrat got 21 percent of the vote and was 
eliminated 
taylors campaign predicted a victory anderson described 
himself in recent days as the underdog and took the offensive 
recently criticizing taylors legislative record and accusing him 
of accepting money from big labor groups

prime minister rajiv gandhi today called 
for new parliamentary elections next month in which he will face 
voters amid charges of inept leadership and government corruption 
voting in the worlds largest democracy will start nov 22 and 
continue nov 24 chief election commissioner rvs perisastri 
told a news conference he said subsequent dates would be announced 
if two days appear insufficient 
gandhis decision came on the heels of fresh charges of 
highlevel corruption and his failure to push two constitutional 
amendments through parliament last week gandhi took office five 
years ago 
by deciding to face the people the government has been forced 
to take the only option available to it said gandhis chief 
political rival vishwanath pratap singh 
singh is the leader of the janata dal one of five groups 
comprising the opposition national front 
united news of india and press trust of india said gandhis 
cabinet decided to set november elections rather than wait for the 
constitutional deadline of late december or early january 
gandhi and his congress party want to turn the election into a 
referendum on the constitutional amendments defeated friday in 
parliaments upper house the press trust said 
gandhi said the amendments were designed to give village and 
municipal governments more autonomy 
they fell three votes short of the necessary twothirds 
majority opposition parties charged the bills were intended to 
consolidate the federal governments power 
some analysts said that by pushing powertothepeople measures 
gandhi hoped to divert attention from charges that he is presiding 
over a corrupt government 
the 45yearold prime minister has been dogged for the past two 
years by charges that people close to him or his party received 
kickbacks paid by the swedish arms company ab bofors 
indian newspapers have alleged that bofors paid as much as 50 
million in commissions or kickbacks to secure its 1986 contract to 
sell 14 billion worth of artillery to india 
gandhi has repeatedly denied he profited from the deal and has 
said no indians received commissions the indian press has charged 
the money went to companies whose ownerships are largely a mystery 
at stake are 542 seats in the lok sabha or house of the people 
parliaments policymaking lower house 
gandhis congress party won 415 seats in the last vote held in 
december 1984 two months after his mother prime minister indira 
gandhi was assassinated by two of her sikh bodyguards 
the wave of sympathy that propelled gandhi to an unprecedented 
landslide subsequently eroded with allegations of corruption 
an august poll published by the respected news magazine india 
today projected gandhis party would win only 314 seats this time 
an opposition victory would mean an end to the nehrugandhi 
dynasty that has governed the worlds largest democracy for all but 
about three years since independence from britain in 1947

romanian leader nicolae ceausescu made 
his first direct attack on reforms in poland and hungary saying 
romanians do not want to become slaves again under similar 
reforms a news agency reported tuesday 
speaking at a rally monday in the northern city of bistrita 
ceausescu made clear that under his hardline policies romania 
would never change its stalinist economic and political system 
for the first time in a public speech ceausescu mentioned 
hungary and poland by name when criticizing their efforts at 
marketoriented economic reforms that grant private business some 
role in the overall national economy 
i would like to give an answer to some gentlemen who ask 
dont romanians too contemplate to take some measures like those 
adopted in hungary and poland dont they too think to give up 
the development of socialist property and turn to the small 
capitalist property the official agerpres news agency quoted 
ceausescu as saying 
i want to give them an answer that we do not think of such 
things we do not want to become slaves again neither of the 
home capitalists nor of the capitalists and imperialists abroad 
he said let those gentlemen have no illusion and no concern no 
one will ever work for them in romania 
ceausescus attack marked an escalation in romanian criticism of 
soviet bloc reforms following a reported attempt by bucharest in 
august to organize joint warsaw pact action to defend socialism 
in poland after the creation of a noncommunist government in that 
country 
romanias centralized economy has brought widespread food and 
energy shortages most farmland is owned by state collective farms 
and the only private farming allowed is in small plots around 
farmers homes all industrial property is state owned 
in a rare move probably triggered by growing criticism about 
food shortages at home ceausescu last week toured poorly stocked 
markets in bucharest and promised better food supplies 
observers speculated that ceausescus weeklong market tour the 
first such visit since 1982 when the government imposed food 
rationing reflected his concern over recent unofficial calls on 
him to step down 
ceausescu apparently wants to ensure that no criticism of his 
harsh domestic policies surfaces at a communist party congress to 
be held in bucharest nov 2025 
in the wake of the visits however foreign diplomats in 
bucharest said the markets still were short of meat and other basic 
staples while fruit and vegetables were of poor quality

the evening post the new zealand capitals only afternoon

mrs newman is entitled to a courteous reception but until the

auckland and new zealands antinuclear policy that led to the 
collapse of the anzus military alliance and the virtual severing of 
its relations with the united states

between the two countries while recognizing major policy 
differences

an artist whose library mural was 
forestalled by a canceled federal grant during the depression says 
hes getting ready to complete his painting on the theme reading 
good books is time well spent 
the works progress administration which hired unemployed 
artists during the depression paid artist wilfrid berg 100 to 
paint a mural featuring people of the world in native dress he 
recalls the mural is on a wall in the childrens reading room at 
hackley public library but the opposite wall is blank because the 
wpa withdrew promised funding in 1934 for a second mural berg said 
berg now 81 said he expects to complete the second mural in 
time for the librarys centennial next year thanks to a private 
donation 
painting has been my life but i never had the studio or the 
space to do the big things i really like to do thats why i 
couldnt resist when i got a chance to do this he said monday 
the design for the second mural features characters from classic 
childrens literature including huck finn peter rabbit 
cinderella rip van winkle and pinocchio 
the benefactors daniel and shirley rapoport of muskegon would 
not disclose the amount of their donation but mrs rapoport said 
it is considerably more than what the wpa paid him

sonoma county has come up with a plan 
to make casting a ballot as easy as buying a fastfood burger 
election officials are opening a drivethrough window so 
motorists can pull up sign their names and drop off their marked 
ballots 
the window will shorten the often long lines of early absentee 
voters filing into the elections office said deputy registrar of 
voters janice atkinson 
her idea was approved easily at a recent meeting of the sonoma 
county board of supervisors despite some doubters 
about 10 percent of the 32000 absentee voters in the county 
cast their ballots at the office 
the plan is expected to take effect after the first of the year 
when the registrar of voters office moves to a new building in the 
county government complex 
the new system including the tellers window and driveup 
ramp is expected to cost 9100

an illinois house committee today voted 
to block further action on abortion restrictions designed to mirror 
the missouri law upheld in july by the us supreme court 
the measure fell one vote short of the 10 needed to clear the 
house rules committee and move to the full house nine lawmakers 
voted in favor of the measure eight against 
antiabortion lawmakers have said they might try to bypass the 
committee and bring the issue to the house but some parliamentary 
experts have questioned whether thats possible 
in a brief debate before the vote antiabortion lawmakers said 
the measure adheres to the guidelines set down by the supreme 
court and that it was an emergency 
i ask you please to vote aye for life said rep penny 
pullen the bills sponsor 
prochoice lawmakers argued that the measure was being rushed to 
final passage and amounts to harassment of physicians and women 
needing lateterm abortions 
yes the supreme court did say on july 3 that a bill like this 
is constitutional said rep barbara flynn currie what it 
didnt and couldnt say is that a bill like this is sensible 
the bill would have required doctors to determine the viability 
of a fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or older before performing 
an abortion and mandate the presence of a second physician at 
abortions of viable fetuses it also would bar public employees and 
public facilities from direct involvement in abortions 
antiabortion lobbyists voiced hope monday for a victory though 
they acknowledged that prochoice movement has gained momentum from 
the recent vote by congress to expand medicaid funding of abortion 
and the defeat of proposed abortion restrictions in florida 
nicholas stojakovich lobbyist for the illinois prolife 
coalition had said monday that if the measure failed in committee 
antiabortion lawmakers might seek another vote later in the week 
or try to bypass the committee and bring the issue to the house 
but he called such alternatives a long shot at best 
if it comes to a vote on tuesday and its voted down that 
could be the end of it he said 
the measure before the rules committee was introduced last 
spring as a legislative vehicle for any new abortion restrictions 
permitted by the us supreme court

britains defense minister said today a report had 
concluded that austrian president kurt waldheim was not responsible 
for the execution of six british commandos in world war ii 
although he probably was aware of them 
the report commissioned by the ministry of defense also 
rejected allegations that britain was involved in covering up 
evidence of waldheims activities as a german army officer 
the report indicates that waldheim knew of the capture of 
the british servicemen and the possible fate of commandos in such 
circumstances defense minister archie hamilton told the house of 
commons 
but no evidence has come to light to indicate that as a junior 
staff officer he had the power either to order or to prevent that 
fate or indeed to affect the outcome in any way 
the government accepted the findings of the research teams 
report he said 
allegations that records were altered destroyed or withheld 
to protect president waldheim are shown to be unfounded hamilton 
said he was not wanted by the united kingdom either as a top 
nazi or as a war criminal 
waldheim a former un secretary general became the first head 
of state to be barred from the united states under a 1987 justice 
department list the department said it had evidence that waldheim 
assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of persons 
because of race religion national origin or political opinion 
the world jewish congress which provided documents for the 
british investigation said in washington that the documents show 
british authorities knew of waldheims wartime activities since 
1948 but still supported his election as secretary general 
waldheim has denied committing atrocities as a nazi intelligence 
officer 
in vienna britains ambassador presented a copy of the report 
to the foreign ministry 
a statement released by waldheims office said the 
investigation report proves once again that the allegations 
against federal president dr kurt waldheim in connection with his 
wartime service are devoid of any foundation in this case too as 
has been the case with previous accusations 
waldheim had been accused of complicity in the murders of the 
british troops captured off the turkish coast in april 1944 
the british troops were taken to the village of arsakli near 
salonica greece for interrogation at the headquarters of the 
intelligence unit of the german army group e where waldheim was a 
junior intelligence officer 
the six commandos of the special boat squadron refused to talk 
and were later shot by a firing squad in a suburb of athens under 
the geneva convention it is a crime to kill prisoners of war 
the ministrys report is based on the work of a 16member team 
which examined british records and documents provided by the united 
states west germany and greece 
an international commission of historians which probed 
waldheims army career reported in february 1988 that the initial 
w was on transcripts of interrogations of the six men 
however the commission said it could not prove a connection 
between waldheim and the commandos though it suggested he knew 
they were shot by the gestapo under a general order by adolf hitler 
that commandos be executed 
the fate of the british troops was part of the commissions 
inquiry into charges that waldheim took part in or facilitated 
atrocities including the massacres of some 60000 yugoslav 
partisans and civilians and the detention of jews

the auto and oil industries faced with 
government proposals to replace gasoline with alternative fuels 
said tuesday they will jointly conduct a scientific runoff to 
determine which fuel cuts air pollution most cheaply 
final results from the research and testing program are not 
expected before next july but the companies said they hoped data 
would be ready in time to influence the outcome of national and 
state legislation on promoting alternative fuels 
congress is considering a bush administration proposal requiring 
that 1 million alternative fuel cars be sold each year in the nine 
most polluted cities by 1997 both the auto and oil industries have 
lobbied against the proposal 
tuesdays joint announcement by the big three auto companies and 
the 14 largest oil companies said their testing program would have 
no bias against methanol the administrations favored 
alternative fuel although the oil industry in recent months has 
carried out an aggressive public campaign against methanol 
we believe this will be a valid study with no bias said 
keith mchenry senior vice president of technology at amoco corp 
he said objectivity will be assured by an advisory panel of 
academic and government experts 
the american petroleum institute the trade association of major 
oil companies has pushed the idea of reformulating gasoline to 
achieve pollution reductions it has repeatedly raised safety 
economic and environmental concerns about methanol 
earlier this month the oil group circulated to members of the 
news media a 1988 letter from the american association of poison 
control centers asserting that a fullscale conversion to methanol 
could trigger big increases in blindness permanent brain damage 
and death due to accidental swallowing of methanol 
methanol is not yet in commercial production although some oil 
companies have been studying it for years it can be produced from 
natural gas or coal 
unlike gasoline methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons and 
nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes 
severe smog problems in many cities methanol is more expensive 
however and presents a host of new problems for auto builders 
because of its corrosive properties that could damage car parts 
mchenry said the 113 million joint research and testing 
program which is starting immediately will use 26 different 
formulations of gasoline all but two of which are experimental 
formulas plus a blend of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent 
gasoline phillips petroleum co will do the fuel blending 
the tests also will evaluate ethanol or grain alcohol as an 
additive to reformulated gasoline 
all types of vehicle emissions tailpipe exhaust evaporation 
and running losses will be measured the data will then be used 
in atmospheric chemistry and air quality models to determine 
potential smog reductions from all the tested fuels 
what were looking for is the most costeffective way to clean 
up the air mchenry said 
mchenry said that while the white house was informed of the 
testing program there were no discussions about its relation to 
president bushs clean air legislation 
he said senior executives from amoco and general motors corp 
met with white house chief of staff john sununu to brief him on the 
program 
he said sounds like a good program go ahead and do it 
weve very interested in the results mchenry said adding 
later it was not a political discussion 
the participating auto companies are gm chrysler corp and ford 
motor co and the oil companies are amoco arco ashland oil inc 
bp america inc chevron corp conoco inc exxon corp marathon 
oil co mobil corp phillips shell oil co sun co inc texaco 
inc and unocal corp

industrial production dipped 01 percent in 
september the first drop in six months the government said 
tuesday in a report that reflected continued weakness in the 
manufacturing sector of the economy 
but michael evans of evans economics inc a washington 
forecasting firm said that while the economy is not strong 
theres no sign of a downturn 
the federal reserve said last months decline in output was the 
first since a 02 percent drop last february it followed a revised 
gain of 03 percent in august and an unchanged rate in july 
indications of the coming dip were contained in a labor 
department report earlier this month that said manufacturers 
reported a september loss of 103000 jobs including 33000 at auto 
plants it was the biggest drop since november 1982 at the end of 
the last recession 
the most significant declines occurred in the output of 
trucks basic metals and construction supplies the fed said 
tuesday the decline in truck production more than offset a sharp 
rise in auto assemblies 
cynthia latta an economist at the drimcgrawhill forecasting 
firm in lexington mass said industrial production has been cut 
in half this year compared to 1988 
this confirms that demand is slowing she said when you 
get a slowdown in the economy it tends to show up first in the 
goods sector 
the manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by the 
feds tightmoney policies as it tries to contain inflation by 
slowing the economy without tipping it into a recession 
william k macreynolds forecasting director for the us 
chamber of commerce called on the fed to ease further its grip on 
credit 
falling industrial production in september was accompanied by 
indications that business investment stopped growing he said 
with inflation coming down it is incumbent on the fed to reduce 
interest rates to encourage investment 
in another report the fed said the operating rate of the 
nations factories mines and utilities also fell in september by 
02 percentage point to 836 percent this also reflected the 
decline in the production rate 
analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or 
above as an indication of inflationary pressures because the closer 
us industry gets to full operating capacity the greater 
difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand leading to 
shortages and price increases 
industrial production at manufacturing plants making both 
durable and nondurable goods fell 02 percent last month after 
rising 03 percent in july 
the decrease in manufacturing output mainly reflected 
widespread weakness in durables which fell 05 percent the fed 
said production of nondurable goods edged up 01 percent 
output at mines and oil wells increased 09 percent while 
production at utilities rose 12 percent 
the fed said its industrial production index in september stood 
at 1423 percent of its 1977 base down from 1424 percent in 
august 
in its factory use report the fed said the operating rate at 
manufacturing plants fell from 841 percent in august to 837 
percent in september it had peaded at 847 percent in january 
the rate at factories producing durable goods bigticket items 
expected to last more than three years fell 06 percentage oint 
to 821 percent the rate at factories producting nondurable goods 
fell 02 percentage point to 86 percent

redstained clothes lying on the sidewalk in front of the hotel 
when police asked them to move the protesters tried to push 
their way through the doors chanting bush quayle we know you 
hitler was elected too 
police used nightsticks to quell the demonstration it was 
hats and bats and shoving and pushing said a police officer who 
didnt give his name 
earlier quayle dropped in at an fbi news conference to praise 
investigators efforts in breaking up a drug ring 
what youve been able to accomplish is part of the strategy of 
president bush in his war against drugs he told law enforcement 
officers from several agencies were not going to give up until 
that war is won 
the news conference was called to announce the seizure of 150 
million worth of tar heroin and cocaine on the west coast

the state naacp demanded full racial 
integration of university of mississippi fraternities and 
sororities in a meeting tuesday with school officials 
the meeting was in response to an incident last month in which 
two white fraternity pledges were left naked with racial slurs 
scrawled on them at a black college near the university 
naacp officials also recommended stiffer penalties for racial 
incidents on campus additional black staff members at the 
university so students of all backgrounds would have more black 
role models and establishment of an academic course that would 
give students a knowledge of black history and cultural differences 
such a course is scheduled to start next fall 
the meeting was a sharing of ideas by officials representing 
the naacp and ole miss officials said ed meek director of 
public relations at the university it was a calm deliberate 
kind of discussion 
the black community is outraged and disturbed at what took 
place and the ongoing racial incidents stemming from the 
fraternities and students who are enrolled there morris kinsey 
education chairman for the state chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said prior to 
the meeting 
kinsey was joined by state naacp president aaron henry and other 
naacp officials in the meeting with a university delegation headed 
by chancellor gerald turner meek said 
he said turner told the naacp officials that many of the 
recommendations were already under study and said their concerns 
certainly would be taken under advisement 
the beta theta pi fraternity was expelled from campus for three 
years because of the recent racial incident the chancellor also 
handed out punishments ranging from expulsion to probation to 14 
students who took part in the prank 
last week turner set up a 23member minority affairs council to 
build programs and policies to increase minority participation in 
campus life

freed african national congress 
leader walter sisulu said tuesday his organization must pursue 
violence to pressure the government into concessions that might 
lead to negotiations 
sisulu released sunday along with six other senior anc leaders 
said pressure by antiapartheid groups locally and abroad compelled 
the government to free them unconditionally after lengthy prison 
terms 
the releases were merely a reaction to the pressure of the 
world sisulu told foreign journalists at a church near his home 
in soweto the huge township outside johannesburg 
sisulu 77 is the highestranking of the freed activists and 
and spent 26 years in prison along with his close friend senior 
anc leader nelson mandela 
president fw de klerk decided to release the prisoners as part 
of his effort to improve the climate for negotiating a new 
constitution that will include the 28 million black majority 
the government has said the anc must renounce violence before it 
can be allowed to participate in the talks but sisulu said he 
believes the anc should pursue violence to maintain pressure on the 
government 
we dont reject violence said sisulu its not because 
the anc believes in violence for its own sake it is because of 
compelling conditions remove the compelling conditions and there 
will be peace 
the ancs bombing and sabotage campaign launched in 1961 has 
been largely dormant this year there have been more than 210 
bombings responsible for 37 deaths since the state of emergency was 
declared in 1986 but only about 40 blasts and three deaths this 
year 
sisulu denied the anc had partially suspended its campaign of 
violence suggesting it was a logistical decision 
he also called for stronger economic sanctions against south 
africa 
the pressure must be sustained he said there must be no 
chance for the government to retreat and reorganize 
he said the anc and its backers would not accept anything short 
of a oneperson onevote system 
democracy i know it to be only one thing a vote for all 
there is no other democracy said sisulu we have got 
fundamental differences on that with the government 
asked about changes in south africa since he went to prison 
sisulu said i find the spirit of the people different i think 
there is much greater political consciousness greater awareness 
greater unity 
the cabinet minister assigned to promote negotiations with black 
leaders said tuesday he was prepared to confer with sisulu about 
the ancs possible role in formal talks 
if we want to get going the fewer preconditions the better 
said constitutional development minister gerrit viljoen 
he said the anc would have to demonstrate it was committed to a 
peaceful negotiation process but he indicated the outlawed 
guerrilla movement would not necessarily have to make a formal 
renunciation of violence as previously demanded by the government 
viljoen said the appropriate climate for negotiations can only 
come about if in practice people distance themselves from 
violence and destablizing activities 
sisulu said the anc would be prepared to enter negotiations if 
the government legalized all banned political organizations lifted 
the state of emergency released all political prisoners and 
reprieved all prisoners on death row 
de klerk says he is reviewing these matters to see what steps he 
might be able to take and viljoen expressed willingness to meet 
with sisulu to discuss the demands 
all but one of the freed prisoners served at least 25 years in 
jail five including sisulu were sentenced to life prison terms 
in 1964 along with mandela for plotting antigovernment sabotage 
mandela 71 remains imprisoned although he is expected to be 
released soon

judge alcee l hastings said tuesday he 
believes he will win his fight to remain on the federal bench but 
hinted he might attempt an unusual appeal to the supreme court if 
the senate votes to remove him 
im not going to be convicted the miami jurist told a news 
conference the day before the senate was to hear final arguments in 
his impeachment case 
a special committee of 12 senators heard evidence in the 
impeachment trial in july and august and the senate is now nearing 
the final chapter in the case 
the senate is to hear final arguments wednesday followed by a 
closeddoor debate thursday with the vote to come at an unspecified 
time afterward 
a senate vote to convict hastings on any of the charges against 
him would immediately remove him as a federal judge and halt 
payment of his 89500 judicial salary 
hastings is accused in the articles of impeachment approved by 
the house in august 1988 of plotting to accept a 150000 payoff 
and lying about it to a us district court jury in 1983 
the jury acquitted hastings the first black federal judge in 
florida history 
the articles of impeachment also accuse hastings of improper 
disclosure of information obtained as a result of a federal wiretap 
that he had authorized the allegation arose after the 1983 trial 
and thus was not an issue in it 
senate action in an impeachment case is considered final 
hastings said however that so many unusual issues have arisen 
that an attempt might be made to appeal an unfavorable verdict to 
the supreme court 
there is that possibility hastings told the news 
conference which was called by congressional delegate walter 
fauntroy ddc as a way to register his support for the 
embattled judge 
as an example of one unusual circumstance in the case he noted 
that he was acquitted by the 1983 jury but being placed on trial 
anyway he said that represented a violation of his right against 
double jeopardy 
the senate has determined that the impeachment trial does not 
represent double jeopardy calling it a fundamentally different 
type of proceeding from a criminal trial if convicted hastings 
would merely be removed as a judge he would not face any sentence 
fine or the like 
hastings reiterated that he believes the major reason for the 
allegations against him is that he was used as a guinea pig to 
test judicial ethics rules but he also expressed the belief that 
race played a role in the case 
i am not guilty of having committed any crime at all 
whatsoever hastings said but even so with innocence as my 
defense and the facts as my defense if i were a white person this 
would not be happening 
despite hastings claim black leaders have with some exceptions 
kept their distance from the case among the house prosecutors 
rep john conyers dmich a veteran campaigner for civil rights 
said at the time hastings was impeached that the judge had brought 
his problems on himself 
fauntroy however told the news conference that basic 
constitutional principles of justice and fairness are being 
violated in the impeachment proceedings against judge alcee 
hastings 
i find it difficult to believe that after nearly a decade 
when records have been lost and witnesses have passed any serious 
student or advocate of the united states constitution would 
consider the upcoming proceedings of the senate just or fair 
fauntroy said

the bush administration made a fresh appeal 
tuesday to palestinian arabs to negotiate with israel despite plo 
rejection of a fivepoint proposal by secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
the palestinians have to find a way to respond positively and 
to move forward and the plo to do nothing to block it margaret 
d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
we are working to try to get the israelis and the palestinians 
to a dialogue she said she declined to say whether the 
administration thought palestinians could agree to negotiate with 
israel without a green light from the palestine liberation 
organization 
the plo central council at the end of a twoday meeting monday 
in baghdad iraq rejected bakers proposal for implementing an 
israeli election plan on the west bank and in gaza 
the plo and the plo alone has the right to name the 
palestinian side to any talks with israel whether they be 
palestinians inside the occupied territories or outside the 
central council declaration said 
the israeli plan and proposals by baker and egyptian president 
hosni mubarak to implement it provide no direct role for the plo 
in talks with israel 
under bakers framework however egypt is consulting with the 
plo about the palestinians who would arrange the elections with 
israel shamir objects meanwhile to mubaraks effort to include 
two palestinians who had been deported from the west bank 
spokeswoman tutwiler said baker is still engaged with 
israeli and egyptian officials about the election proposal 
however she added if in the end the parties in the area are 
not prepared to pursue peace then progress will not be made we 
cannot produce progress on our own if the parties do not have the 
will to move ahead 
under shamirs proposal palestinians chosen in the balloting 
would make arrangements with israel for five years of limited 
selfrule to be followed by wider negotiations on an overall middle 
east settlement egypt and jordan which held gaza and the west 
bank for 20 years would participate in the talks 
the plo has denounced the proposal as a device to preclude the 
establishment of a palestinian state us policy opposes statehood 
for the palestinians while calling on israel to relinquish 
territory in return for peace 
spokeswoman tutwiler said baker was not discouraged by the plo 
councils action obviously the palestinians have to find a way 
to respond positively and to move forward the us official 
said they should have an interest in pursuing peace in a 
realistic way we do not consider any of these statements to be 
anybodys last words 
bakers fivepoint proposal includes a threeway meeting in 
washington with israelis and egyptians before the 
israelipalestinian talks also israel would meet with 
palestinians only if it was satisfied with the composition of 
the delegation

prime minister rajiv gandhi on tuesday 
called new parliamentary elections for next month following charges 
of corruption against his government and the defeat of two 
constitutional amendments 
the elections are seen as a test of the durability of the 
worlds only democratically elected dynasty gandhis family has 
governed independent india for all but five years of its 42year 
history 
voting will be conducted nov 22 and nov 24 in all but one of 
indias 25 states said chief election commissioner rvs peri 
sastri new elections had been due by midjanuary 
because of the vastness of this country of 880 million people 
elections normally are conducted over several days 
at stake are 542 seats in the lok sabha or house of the people 
the lawmaking lower house of parliament gandhis congress party 
won 415 seats in the last elections held in december 1984 two 
months after sikh bodyguards assassinated gandhis mother and 
predecessor indira gandhi 
gandhis decision to call elections early came on the heels of 
new charges of highlevel corruption and his failure to push the 
two amendments through parliament last week 
viswanath pratap singh once one of the prime ministers 
staunchest allies and now one of his bitterest rivals said gandhi 
had no choice 
by deciding to face the people the government has been forced 
to take the only option available to it said singh leader of 
the janata dal or peoples party one of five opposition groups 
that comprise the often fractious coalition known as the national 
front 
the national front and the janata dal are fully prepared to 
meet the challenge posed to the future of the nation by a corrupt 
inept and treacherous regime headed by a totally venal and amoral 
individual said singh who once belonged to gandhis congress 
party and served him as defense and finance ministers 
the decision to call fresh elections came abruptly with gandhi 
canceling plans to attend this weeks commonwealth summit in 
malaysia and summoning his cabinet 
the decision is a culmination of political developments after 
the constitutional amendment bills failed to get the requisite 
twothirds majority said an official source speaking on 
condition of anonymity the government also wanted to scotch 
rumors that it was considering postponing the election 
sources said gandhi and the congress party wanted to turn the 
election into a referendum on the two bills he had campaigned hard 
for only to see them fall three votes short of the necessary 
twothirds majority friday the bills were proposed constitutional 
amendments that gandhi said would give more power to village and 
municipal governments 
singh and other opposition politicians however said the bills 
were intended to consolidate federal power at the expense of state 
governments 
gandhi a 45yearold former airline pilot has been dogged for 
more than two years by opposition and newspaper charges that people 
close to him and his party received up to 50 million in kickbacks 
from the swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors to secure a 1986 
contract to sell 14 billion worth of artillery guns to india 
gandhi has repeatedly denied he profited from the deal and 
insisted no indians received commissions but newspaper reports 
have alleged the money was funneled to a series of companies whose 
ownerships are largely a mystery

president bush assured south korean president 
roh tae woo today that the united states will stand by its security 
commitments but said south korea must open its markets more to us 
products 
with roh standing at his side in the east room of the white 
house after more than two hours of talks bush promised that us 
forces will remain in south korea as long as there is a threat 
from the north he expressed support for rohs efforts to reduce 
tensions on the peninsula 
but he said that while korean workers and companies have 
benefited from access to open markets in the united states 
american workers and companies deserve equal access to korean 
markets 
bush added that protectionism offers no more than a false 
prosperity 
the trade issue has been the thorniest between the two 
countries and roh said much progress has been made in easing 
frictions 
he said in spite of many domestic difficulties the korean 
government with strong faith in free and fair trade has been 
moving toward economic liberalization and market opening 
on the security question roh said he and bush agreed that there 
should be no change in existing arrangements adding that he felt 
reassured by bushs position 
the two exchanged views at an oval office session also attended 
by secretary of state james a baker iii and defense secretary dick 
cheney 
talk of a reduced us military deployment has become more 
commonplace as south korea becomes more prosperous and the soviet 
union appears to be a less menacing adversary than it was before 
moscow has close links to seouls archrival north korea 
roh said before leaving south korea that he saw little 
possibility of any significant change in the general level of 
us forces in south korea which have numbered about 40000 for 
many years 
but he said south korea will increase its share of the cost of 
stationing us forces in his country 
meanwhile a senior us official briefing reporters on monday 
said maintenance of the us deterrent in south korea is a high 
priority for both countries 
still the official asking not to be identified said minor 
reductions are possible in the future as south korea assumes a 
larger role in its own defense 
after late morning talks in the white house oval office bush 
planned a working luncheon with his guest roh also expects to 
address a joint meeting of congress during his stay 
bush met with roh in seoul a month after taking office 
the us ambassador to japan michael armacost appeared to be 
laying the groundwork for an eventual us troop reduction when he 
said last week there will come a time when it is appropriate to 
adjust the size of us forces in south korea 
the administration has begun a review of the us military 
commitment to south korea and some in congress believe reductions 
should come sooner rather than later 
but the administration believes that with north korea continuing 
to modernize its military forces the united states should be in no 
hurry to institute cutbacks 
administration officials are delighted with the democratic 
progress south korea has made over the past two years 
but human rights groups claim there has been an increase in 
repression lately and the senior us official said monday that 
although the overall picture is positive the impression should 
not be one of complacency in washington 
roh has defended the arrest of several hundred dissidents in 
recent months saying they had violated the law 
antiamerican radicals are a small but powerful lobby in south 
korea they added to their reputation for bold action last week 
when six of them staged a violent attack on the us ambassadors 
residence 
thousands took part in antiamerican protests around the country 
on friday and saturday

the bush administration made a fresh appeal 
tuesday to palestinian arabs to neg 
the house early this month approved a 227 billion child care 
package that miller said addresses the problems of salary and 
training now lawmakers are working out differences between the 
house version and one passed by the senate earlier this year 
the study funded with 500000 by a consortium of foundations 
including the ford foundation and the foundation for child 
development examined 227 child care centers in atlanta boston 
detroit phoenix and seattle between february 1988 and august 1988 
the centers served more than 16000 families and employed more 
than 3000 staffers 
the staffing study dramatically supports the adage you get 
what you pay for said barbara willer of the national 
association for the education of young children 
the study was endorsed by both the service employees 
international union and the american federation of state county 
and municipal employees which have been working to organize child 
care workers 
seiu president john sweeney noted that only 4 percent of child 
care teachers are protected by a union contract and called for 
adoption of minimum federal standards for adultchild ratios 
staff training education and compensation 
investigator deborah phillips of the university of virginia said 
the study found better quality centers had higher wages for 
teaching staff lower teaching staff turnover better educated and 
trained staff and more teachers caring for fewer children better 
centers also were more likely to be nonprofit she said 
the study also found that low and highincome children were 
more likely than middleincome children to attend centers providing 
higher quality care she said the main reason is that day care for 
lowincome families oftentimes is subsidized by the federal 
government while middleincome families must personally pay for 
the entire expense

pope john paul ii said tuesday that 
governments have the duty to protect human life from conception 
until death 
noting that the roman catholic church defends human life from 
its initial stages until its natural end the pontiff said civil 
authorities must do the same 
civil society which is responsible for the common good has 
the duty to guarantee through law the right to life for all and 
the respect of every human life until its last moment he said 
the pontiff who returned monday night from a 10day asian 
pilgrimage spoke to a group of european bishops meeting in rome to 
discuss the way birth and death are treated in modern society 
john paul said the issue poses a serious challenge to the 
church especially in the wake of this centurys scientific and 
technological advances 
he said modern society pushes man to a reduced vision of birth 
and death in which the transcendent dimension of the person 
becomes obscured if not altogether ignored or denied 
the church has the historic task of helping modern man recover 
the sense of living and dying which in many cases today seems to 
escape him the pope said 
he specifically condemned abortion which is outlawed by the 
church and warned about advances in genetics and biogenetics which 
sometimes lead to the logic of the creation of a product and not 
the procreation of a person 
the pope offered his support to groups coming under the banner 
movements for life and said the church should work closer with 
them 
in warsaw polands ambassador to the vatican said the pope may 
make his fourth trip to his homeland as pontiff in 1991 
there have been no official statements by the government or 
the episcopate but there is every indication that in tune with the 
fouryear cycle we must prepare for this pilgrimage said 
ambassador jerzy kuberski interviewed in the government daily

collecting antigovernment material

for 11 years since the soviets withdrew their troops in february 
the guerrillas have continued to battle the sovietbacked 
government in kabul 
in a news conference in september garcia said he was had not 
collaborated with the guerrillas and that he was just making 
notes for my book 
a government spokesman said garcias fiveyear sentence was not 
excessive and that it matched the conviction he said the 
government would consider relasing garcia if spain made a formal 
request 
the afghan government apparently seeks to use such incidents for 
diplomatic purposes a senior french official went to kabul last 
month to secure the release of henrixavier lemire a french aid 
worker also arrested for illegally entering afghanistan 
in july the afghan government released a jailed american 
photographer tony obrien after washington complied with a demand

the nations education secretary is in east 
harlem to hail that struggling district for allowing parents wide 
choice in the schools their kids can attend he got back a bitter 
message praise is nice but send money 
several hundred parents educators and community activists met 
with us education secretary lauro f cavazos on monday night in 
the auditorium of intermediate school 117 
the schools district ranked last in pupil performance in the 
city 17 years ago but gained national recognition by replacing 
overcrowded failing schools with 52 smaller magnet schools for 
parents to choose from 
you have right here one of the best examples of choice in the 
united states cavazos told the gathering the first event in a 
twoday regional meeting that the bush administration hopes will 
help spread the idea of choice as a reform measure 
choice is the cornerstone of education reform cazvazos said 
in the keynote speech delivered today 
he stressed however that he did not view choice as a cureall 
for americas education problems when i talk about choice i see 
that as one one of the strategies 
the conference was to conclude later in the day with a speech by 
new jersey gov thomas kean and workshops on how choice operates 
elsewhere in the country 
president bush and others believe that if parents had more 
options the resulting competition would compel schools everywhere 
to improve bush has called choice the single most promising 
idea in education today 
but parent after parent during monday nights 2hour forum said 
schools generally and in their district in particular were 
shortchanged by the federal state and city governments 
i dont want to read his lips i dont want to see a thousand 
lights what we need is money said pat bradford a newark nj 
parent 
dolores quintero whose 10yearold son attends school in the 
east harlem district and who was homeless for 15 months said if 
i could learn to stretch my dollars when i was homeless then you 
in the government ought to be able to figure it out in the name of 
jesus kick up the money 
several parents referred to the education departments rejection 
in august of the districts application for a 14 million federal 
magnet school grant leaving the local board struggling to save 30 
teaching and staff positions 
the irony is that were celebrating choice at a time when 
were in a crisis in this district instead of increased support 
were getting less support said ray rivera who has two children 
in the districts schools 
cavazos in brief remarks at the close of the evening session 
said that the funding issue will continue to be a major major 
discussion at a news conference today he said that east 
harlems grant bid had been denied through a competitive process 
that he had nothing to do with 
unfortunately we ran out of money cavazos said he added 
that the bush administration had sought from congress last spring 
100 million in additional federal magnet school grants the 
measure is still awaiting action 
cavazoss twoday visit to the school was the first of five 
regional meetings on parental choice planned by the administration 
the other stops are in minneapolisst paul oct 2324 charlotte 
nc nov 1314 denver nov 1617 and richmond calif nov 
2829 
minnesota iowa nebraska and arkansas already have adopted 
statewide open enrollment plans giving parents wide discretion 
in choosing schools even outside their districts scores of local 
districts around the country have for years offered magnet and 
alternative schools that extend options beyond neighborhood schools 
several education groups have been cool to the idea of choice 
warning its no cure for americas school problems 
in a statement last month the american association of school 
administrators expressed concern that the choice concept might 
worsen some schools by encouraging the most motivated parents and 
youngsters to flee while other families simply couldnt afford the 
transportation to schools outside their neighborhoods 
but choice advocates frequently cite harlems community school 
district 4 where is 117 is located as proof that choice can 
transform even desperately downtrodden urban districts 
in 1972 district 4 was dead last among new york citys 32 
community districts in reading and math scores only 15 percent 
read at their grade level is 117 was a failing impersonal 
school with more than 2000 students 
armed with federal and private dollars and the idea that parents 
should be free to choose among schools with themes nearly everyone 
agrees that schools like is 117 were gradually transformed for 
the better so much so that children outside this impoverished 
district are on waiting lists to attend 
the school houses four academies schools within schools each 
occupying a floor and each with roughly 200 students a gifted 
program a school for performing arts a career academy to help 
children develop career goals and a special school with small 
classes to help underachieving youngsters with emotional problems

nearly all the 1160 inmates at the federal 
detention center boycotted the dining hall for a second day 
tuesday but officials said they couldnt find out why 
weve had staff circulating through the population since 
yesterday lunchtime and we just havent been able to pick up much 
of anything ml jeziorski executive assistant to the warden 
said 
only about 100 inmates ate at the dining hall monday or tuesday 
he said 
in an ordinary hunger strike the inmates would present a list 
of grievances to the administration in hopes of getting changes 
said jeziorski but weve gotten no list of complaints no one 
stood forth as spokesman for inmates 
at lunch monday inmates refused a meal of pork chops potatoes 
cabbage and salad jeziorski said they also refused to eat the 
dinner of meatballs and noodles 
jeziorski said the prison closed the commissary after lunch 
monday so striking inmates could eat only what little they might 
have in their cells 
in 1987 cuban detainees took hostages rioted and set fire to 
the federal detention center during an eightday siege the rebuilt 
center does not house cuban detainees jeziorski said 
he said inmates at the center continued the normal routine of 
work school and recreation 
theres not even a hint of violence or anything of that 
nature he said

nasa has given elaborate assurances 
that the nuclear power plant carried by space shuttle atlantis is 
safe but dozens of experts were on hand just in case before 
todays launch was scrubbed 
they were ready if the unthinkable happens said chris west 
a spokesman for the department of energy 
about 50 people carrying dosimeters and other devices were to be 
scattered around the kennedy space center to sample the air in case 
of an accident as the shuttle lifted off the launch was scheduled 
for 1257 pm but was canceled because of rain and nasa 
considered making another attempt on wednesday the department of 
energy had planned to have an airplane aloft and 150 people 
standing by 
in a washington courtroom last week attorneys for the national 
aeronautics and space administration convinced a judge that the 
launch was safe and that the two nuclear power packs on the galileo 
space probe would not leak even after a challengerlike explosion 
west said the department of energy was asked by the state of 
florida and brevard county where the kennedy space center is 
located to monitor the launch a twin turboprop airplane 
outfitted with sophisticated detection equipment was to circle the 
area at liftoff time 
if the unthinkable happens as soon as the big pieces stop 
falling the plane will do a crisscross pattern around the 
vicinity of the problem and map from the air what the radiation 
levels are and where its going he said 
ten teams of two people each will be at posts outside the launch 
center with equipment designed to detect plutonium238 the fuel 
used to provide electricity for the galileo space probe on its 
eightyear mission to jupiter 
the two nuclear generators on galileo carrying 247 pounds of 
plutonium each are not reactors and would not produce fission 
products in an explosion nasa said if the containers broke open 
the plutonium inside would emit mostly heat and alpha radiation a 
lowlevel radiation that is stopped by even a piece of paper 
in case of an accident said west state and local authorities 
would go on radio and television and advise people to stay indoor 
or in their cars and turn on the air conditioning until the 
pollution had blown out of the area

un officials have impartially supervised 
preparations for upcoming elections in namibia despite initial 
fears they might favor leftist guerrillas a top state department 
official said tuesday 
john r bolton the assistant secretary of state for 
international organizations told a group of conservatives that the 
un transition assistance group in namibia has done a good job of 
preparing the country for its first elections nov 7 
voters in the country a south africagoverned territory 
formerly known as southwest africa will go to the polls to elect 
delegates for a constituent assembly that body will draft a 
constitution for when namibia gains full independence next year 
bolton said officials in washington were worried that untag 
officials might show favoritism to rebels from the southwest 
africa peoples organization or swapo the group that waged 
guerrilla warfare against south africa for 23 years 
swapo which operated from bases in angola and other countries 
has a strong marxist element several years ago the un general 
assembly accorded swapo observer status at the united nations it 
also created the council for namibia a group that was to 
administer the country 
as a result we and others had significant worries that the 
united nations could not be impartial in supervising an election in 
namibia bolton said in prepared remarks at a conference on the 
future of the territory 
to date however untag has not shown any favoritism towards 
swapo as was feared although there have been reports that 
individual personnel in untag have done so 
the un special representative has told his subordinates that 
the need to be and be perceived as impartial is a key 
requirement 
as an example of evenhandedness bolton said the un officials 
authorized the use of south african and namibian forces to 
counterattack when swapo tried to infiltrate armed guerrillas into 
northern namibia in april he said 
in the election swapo representatives will run against those 
from rightleaning democratic turnhalle alliance and the federal 
convention of namibia 
so far nearly 700000 namibians have registered to vote and 
41000 namibians refugees have been repatriated 
if all goes well conservatives should cautiously welcome the 
un role in namibia bolton said the emergence of a new state 
according to democratic principles is a rare event in the history 
of decolonization

the senate moved ahead today on a 9 million 
aid package president bush is seeking to give the political 
opposition a boost in nicaraguan elections scheduled for next year 
the senate voted 7425 to limit debate on the issue assuring 
that the matter would come up for a final vote later in the day 
sixty votes were required to invoke cloture heading off filibuster 
threats from opponents of the package 
earlier at the white house bush had mapped strategy with 
republican senators in a bid to win support for the aid package of 
which up to 2 million could go to an electoral council controlled 
by the leftist sandinista government 
the money would flow through the national endowment for 
democracy a quasigovernmental body established by congress to 
encourage democratic processes around the world 
some of it would be used to boost the longshot election chances 
of opposition newspaper publisher violeta chamorro the 
presidential candidate of the opposition coalition uno she is 
opposing incumbent president daniel ortega who is seeking 
reelection 
under nicaraguan law half of any contribution to mrs chamarro 
must go to the sandinistacontrolled supreme electoral council 
which is supposed to use the money for expenses of running the 
election but us officials fear the it could be spent to aid the 
sandinista side 
the cloture vote came because of fears that opponents would 
filibuster the bill 
the administration was concerned about an amendment planned by 
sen tom harkin diowa that officials said could torpedo the 
entire aid package 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush told the 
senators that no one likes the prospect of giving 2 million to the 
sandinistas but we have no choice 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo charged after the meeting with bush 
that the real intent of the harkin amendment is to assist the 
sandinistas 
harkin a liberal was forging an alliance with conservative 
senators in an effort to prohibit any us aid from going to the 
sandinistas the administration said that would in effect kill the 
whole aid package and wind up hurting mrs chamarros chances 
harkin was not immediately available for comment but his 
legislative assistant ed long said the senator wants to have 
positive constructive support for free elections not support that 
would be perceived as having bought off the election that can be 
done with a smaller package 
long said the united states has already provided 35 million 
through the national endowment for democracy for the nicaraguan 
elections 
the sandinistas in control of nicaragua since 1979 have agreed 
to elections feb 25 mrs chamarro is facing an uphill struggle 
against sandinista president daniel ortega 
fitzwater quoted bush as saying many senators dont want to 
give aid to the sandinistas and neither do we but we have no 
choice its the only way to help mrs chamarro and the opposition 
to assure a reasonable shot at free and fair elections 
congress and the administration have stopped military aid to the 
antisandinista contra rebels 
fitzwater said bush feels this election is the last crucial 
shot at getting representative democracy in nicaragua under 
current circumstances with the sandinista government controlling 
the media the assets the money the funding and mrs chamarro 
and the opposition being so underfunded there is no way to suggest 
that this is a fair election without some us support for her 
campaign

windfall or short change taxes arent as 
certain as they used to be 
a 20 million bank error threw off state estimates of how much 
sales tax revenue was due earlier this month to new york counties 
cities and towns 
quarterly checks to many downstate governments such as putnam 
county came up short while plattsburgh and others upstate got 
more than they deserved 
but benjamin franklins famous axiom the one about death and 
taxes being the worlds only certainties may not be off on the 
tax part for long 
we will be informing them very shortly of the adjustments we 
have to make upward or downward said paul rickard a state tax 
department spokesman they shouldnt look at what happened this 
month as any significant trend 
about 20 million in tax revenue was not counted at a bank 
skewing the complex formula the state uses to distribute the money 
plattsburgh for example wrongly received a check for 822000 
a 17 percent increase over 697000 last year putnam county 
received less tax revenue than last year 39 million compared 
with just more than 4 million

every childs fantasy has come to downtown 
washington where the national geographic society has gathered toy 
trains of every size and era into a model railroad heaven 
collected from basements and museums garages and model clubs 
across the land the trains will be on display until jan 7 at 
explorers hall on the ground floor of the societys headquarters 
intricate wood and ivory trains carved by ernest warther are 
displayed across from giant oneeighth size metal model 
locomotives elegant place settings from railroad dining cars are 
around the corner from a computerized control system that can run 
80 electric model trains at once 
a class of maryland thirdgraders scampered busily around the 
displays on opening day boys and girls equally interested and 
amazed 
but the joy was far from limited to the children with national 
geographic president gilbert grosvenor overheard volunteering to 
remain at the exhibit and help out following the grand opening 
the disappearing railroad blues was playing over the sound 
system as the exhibit opened but looking around a visitor would 
never know that trains are no longer the nations most important 
transportation system 
railroad calendars from past years cover one wall a large 
display case traces the comparative sizes of the different popular 
model train gauges a video plays in an enclosed area and visitors 
can listen to recordings of train sounds and railroad history 
people of all ages share a nostalgia about railroading 
observed susan coughlin deputy director of the federal railroad 
administration 
these models she commented trace the growth of the united 
states from coast to coast 
lionel trains inc lent many current and historical items for 
the display presenting lionel president arthur peisner with a 
souvenir boxcar model grosvenor paused for a moment and quipped 
this is a little like someone giving me a map 
the railroad display is a map of exacting work and nostalgia 
any model is never really finished said robert love of 
bethlehem pa who lent a section of his model of leaville a 
project he and his son dennis have been working on for decades 
leaville is a model of a fictional california mining town in the 
1930s 
only nine feet of the 20foot leaville model has come to 
washington enclosed in a large covered display to simulate night 
all buildings are lighted from inside to show the detail street 
lights glow and even automobiles have lighted headlights 
less technology but the same dedication to detail is shown in 
the display of david warther who lent several models carved by his 
late father ernest 
the elder warther carved various woods ivory and mother of 
pearl by hand into exacting model trains 
my father felt that every soul on earth had a godgiven 
talent if they could just find it he found his at age 5 said 
warther 
one model is dismantled to show the exactness warther points 
out that a single drive wheel is composed of 54 pieces including 
hubs made of a wood containing natural oils so they would never 
have to be oiled since that could stain other parts 
his father a steel worker spent a lifetime carving the model 
trains creating a detailed history of the steam engine that the 
family now displays at a museum in dover ohio 
playing in their fathers workshop was perhaps the ultimate 
childhood for train lovers like warther and his sister and he 
remembers fondly that if as sometimes happened there was an 
accident and something got broken dad wasnt cross 
his father believed that it took more energy to get mad than to 
simply repair whatever damage had been done said david warther

housing secretary jack kemps plan to fight 
urban poverty with economic enterprise zones ran into skeptics 
tuesday in the house ways and means committee where democrats 
questioned the cost and said big new tax breaks would benefit the 
wealthy 
i think we have to be persuaded by more than your 
enthusiasm rep byron dorgan dnd told kemp as the secretary 
made his familiar pitch for enterprise zones im not convinced 
the enthusiasm makes much sense 
i hope theres more here than just enthusiasm responded 
kemp i didnt come here to be a cheerleader 
kemp secretary of housing and urban development appeared 
before the taxwriting committee to push the administrations plan 
for a program of tax incentives aimed at attracting new business 
investment to designated areas of economic blight 
the administrations proposal also sponsored with democratic 
rep charles rangel of new york would start with 50 such zones 
phased in over four years in an effort to win the support of 
ruraldistrict legislators such as dorgan its sponsors have 
provided for a portion of the zones to be designated for depressed 
rural areas 
the proposal would eliminate the capital gains tax on tangible 
assets within the zones provide investors with a 50000 per year 
tax deduction for new equity investment and provide an income tax 
credit for lowincome wageearners 
kemp has frequently boosted the plan in appearances before 
congress as it is a centerpiece of his plan to use private 
enterprise to fight poverty on tuesday he told the panel it 
represented not trickledown economics but a niagra falls 
of economic growth 
kemp estimated the cost at 1 billion over four years rep jj 
pickle dtexas said the total cost when more zones are added 
could be much higher and said congress has apprehension and fear 
that once this starts the cost will go out of bounds 
the cost is the thing weve got to face pickle said 
otherwise the committee is going to have reservations 
kemp said the cost would not get out of bounds 
kemps plan won support from many republican members but rep 
don pease dohio charged the program would generate enormous 
tax benefits for the wealthy 
why do we have to help poor people by first helping wealthy 
people he said 
kemp said the tax breaks would benefit investors but that their 
money invested in the zones would provide jobs and opportunity 
for the poor i want to give other people a chance to get rich 
he said 
chairman dan rostenkowski dill questioned how sponsors could 
justify a program that would provide benefits to businesses on one 
end of a street but not on the other 
if you can prove to us this is a worthwhile project i 
certainly would join with my colleagues to initiate at least a 
pilot program rostenkowski told kemp

the national organization for women 
launched a tour this week to encourage women to vote for democrat 
l douglas wilder for governor because of the antiabortion views 
of his republican opponent 
the involvement by now in the campaign between wilder 
virginias lieutenant governor and former attorney general j 
marshall coleman reflects a turn in the contest during the past 
couple of weeks to a focus on abortion 
if we get illegal abortions in this country women will die 
said now president molly yard we will never go back to the day 
when abortions were illegal in this country 
nows freedom caravan for womens lives stopped monday in 
newport news in frederickburg on tuesday richmond on wednesday 
and roanoke on thursday 
the now caravan comes on the heels of a newspaper and television 
advertising campaign by the national abortion rights action league 
which has targeted coleman for defeat nov 7 
antiabortion activists have been less visible in the campaign 
focusing instead on informing supporters about the candidates 
views and conducting occasional protests at abortion clinics 
however some advertising has been used 
we intend to be involved for mr coleman said david n 
osteen of the national right to life committee we just dont 
discuss our strategy we want to stay as flexible as possible 
polls show that most virginians have prochoice views on 
abortion 
wilder has endorsed parental consent when a minor seeks an 
abortion but otherwise supports leaving unchanged virginias law 
which allows virtually unrestricted abortions in the first 
trimester 
coleman opposes abortion except when the pregnant womans life 
is threatened but has said he would not ask the general assembly to 
adopt abortion restrictions 
the abortion debate has all but overshadowed other issues in the 
campaign wilders bid to become the first elected black governor 
of a us state and colemans comeback effort from a 1981 defeat in 
the race for governor against democrat charles s robb

of the most technologically advanced computing devices in the 
world had expected to receive about 69 million over the next five

rain today forced nasa to postpone 
until wednesday the launch of space shuttle atlantis and its 
jupiterbound galileo probe 
it appears the local weather will not cooperate so were 
going to have to scrub launch director bob sieck said after the 
26minute period during which earth and jupiter were in proper 
alignment elapsed without a break in the weather 
liftoff of the shuttle and its crew of five was reset for 1250 
pm wednesday 
with about 200 armed security guards on alert for antinuclear 
trespassers protesting against launch of the plutoniumpowered 
galileo the countdown had advanced smoothly to a point nine 
minutes before the designated 1257 pm liftoff time 
showers moved into an area 20 miles offshore that atlantis would 
have to pass through if the astronauts had to make an emergency 
landing on a 15000foot runway near the launch pad 
nasa twice suspended the countdown hoping the rain would pass 
but time ran out 
rain hitting a descending shuttle could severely damage the 
fragile fiberglass tiles that protect the vehicle from heat during 
reentry from orbit 
if the galileo isnt launched by nov 21 nasa will have to wait 
until 1991 before the planets are again in the right position 
the 15 billion galileo is the most expensive and sophisticated 
unmanned spacecraft ever built and is expected to give the best 
look yet at the mysteries of another planet 
it is the rollsroyce of spacecraft said clayne yeates a 
mission manager 
the five astronauts boarded the spacecraft at midmorning the 
mission commander is donald williams the others aboard were mike 
mcculley the pilot and mission specialists ellen baker franklin 
changdiaz and shannon lucid 
guards on foot in helicopters and boats patrolled the kennedy 
space center for activists who have said they might try to stop the 
launch by infiltrating the launch danger zone the zone covers five 
miles on either side of a line that extends 30 miles to sea 
eight demonstrators were arrested for trespassing monday when 
they walked through a line of security guards at a space center 
gate another was arrested today when he walked up to a gate and 
stepped across the space center boundary line 
the activists oppose the launch because galileo receives 
electrical power from two generators fueled by nearly 50 pounds of 
plutonium they contend an accident a challengerlike explosion 
could scatter radioactive material over florida 
officials of the florida coalition for peace and justice which 
is leading the protests had said they would remain today in 
orlando 50 miles away so they would not have to breathe 
radioactive plutonium if there were an accident 
nasa said the chances of a plutonium release are less than 1 in 
25000 and even if there were a release there would be no 
appreciable health effects 
last week three groups lost a federal court lawsuit to stop the 
launch on monday a threejudge appeals court panel upheld the 
ruling 
about 6 hours after liftoff the astronauts were to release 
galileo from atlantis cargo bay an hour later an attached motor 
was to boost the 6700pound craft on a roundabout sixyear trip 
that will cover 24 billion miles along the path to jupiter the 
largest planet in the solar system 
along the way galileo will obtain flyby data about the moon 
venus and two asteroids gaspra and ida it will make two return 
swings by earth to within 600 miles next year and within 200 miles 
in 1992 the sweeps past earth and venus will use the planets 
gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speed to reach 
its distant target 
in december 1995 a 737pound probe released from galileo is to 
plunge into jupiters cloud layers and make the first sampling of 
its atmosphere 
galileo will orbit the planet and its cameras and 10 scientific 
instruments will gather information for about 22 months on 
temperatures magnetic fields radiation clouds and gravity fields 
the 1979 voyager views of jupiter and its satellites were 
breathtaking but galileos images will be up to 1000 times 
clearer planners say

president mikhail s gorbachev wandered like a kid 
in a candy store through displays of ibm computers bandaids and 
ritz crackers tuesday at the first fullfledged us trade show to 
be held in the soviet union 
deprived soviet consumers soon will enjoy a small flood of such 
goodies according to the head of the council that organized the 
fair 
dwayne andreas cochairman of the usussr trade and 
economic council said he received a letter from president bush 
promising to press for reduced trade barriers with the soviet union 
bush wrote that he was prepared to work with congress to open 
the way to extending mostfavorednation status to the soviet 
union andreas said 
if the soviet union is granted mostfavorednation status 
american tariffs on imported soviet goods will be lowered 
that means well be customers and not only suppliers 
andreas said before the fair opened 
a consortium of six american companies is planning to export 
500 million in consumer goods to the soviet union in the coming 
months and invest up to 10 billion in joint sovietamerican 
ventures in the next 15 years andreas said 
almost 150 american firms were represented at the trade show 
gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov meandered for almost 
two hours along the aisles of stands leaving excited vendors in 
their wake and collecting an array of souvenirs 
gorbachev took a veggie burger said joan godby who was at 
the stand promoting the archer daniels midlandproduced powder that 
turns into vegetarian simulations of burgers i dont know if he 
actually ate it but there was a piece out of it 
gorbachev closely surrounded by jostling bodyguards and 
reporters lingered longest at the ibm stand where he asked 
questions about technology and came away with a prize a microchip 
from the most advanced type of computer ibm sells in the soviet 
union embedded in clear plastic and hooked to a keychain 
gorbachev and ryzhkov were also presented with small stuffed 
dogs by a manufacturer of toys and childrens clothes 
gorbachev encouraged one vendor with the prediction that if 
you get a foothold in the soviet market the opportunities are 
endless 
but he made it clear with his repeated queries about companies 
intentions in the soviet union that he was most pleased by firms 
that wanted not only to buy and sell but also to set up joint 
manufacturing enterprises 
us trade with the soviet union traditionally has been minimal 
hampered by the longtime political tension between the two 
countries and by geographical distance 
sovietamerican agriculture trade mainly american sales of 
grain amounts to more than 2 billion andreas said but when i 
added up the trade other than agriculture quite recently i came 
face to face with the fact that its less than we do with haiti or 
trinidad he said 
sovietamerican trade is already expanding with the volume 
rising from 18 billion in 1987 to 33 billion in 1988 said 
soviet chamber of commerce chairman vladislav malkevich 
about 100 american companies have founded joint enterprises with 
soviet firms malkevich added 
he said about 20000 representatives of soviet businesses were 
expected to visit the fair during its eightday run and try to make 
a deal with american partners 
fair organizers acknowledged that perhaps the greatest obstacle 
to sovietamerican trade remained the nonconvertibility of the 
ruble the ruble is not freely exchanged on world currency markets 
and its rate is dictated by the soviet government 
asked what guarantee of profitability american firms can have as 
long as the ruble remains nonconvertible gorbachev said i 
think that in time everything will fall into place everything is 
being done toward that end 
andreas refuted soviet complaints that the united states does 
not seem interested enough in helping gorbachevs reforms work by 
investing in joint enterprises we have over 1000 people here 
if that isnt an expression of interest then i dont know what 
is he said 
the scores of stands at the fair made the giant exhibition 
center in central moscow slightly reminiscent of a usstyle 
shopping mall with displays of such americana as qtips levis 
jeans cocacola and a gleaming midnight blue cadillac 
among the more esoteric offerings were soy protein for soviet 
sausages dental floss and chickengrowing systems

unescos general conference on tuesday postponed 
the plos request for membership for two years a move aimed in 
part at persuading the united states to rejoin the un agency 
in return for agreeing to the postponement the palestine 
liberation organization obtained assurances that unesco would 
involve palestinians in the israelioccupied territories more 
closely in its activities 
the decision by the united nations educational scientific and 
cultural organizations highest decisionmaking body was taken by 
consensus the executive board called oct 11 for the postponement 
yacov aviad the israeli representative to unesco protested the 
plo membership request in the most vigorous terms and said it 
would divert the organization from more pressing business 
the head of the plo observer mission omar massalha said his 
group accepted the postponement in order to avoid a confrontation 
or disruption that is not in unescos interests 
the united states which left unesco in 1985 had said admitting 
palestine as a member state would eliminate any chance of a us 
return 
massalha said if the plo had lobbied to have the membership 
application approved it would have succeeded most unesco members 
recognize the palestinian state proclaimed by the plo in november 
1988 
unesco has promised the palestinians greater participation in 
its educational and cultural programs in the west bank and gaza 
at his opening speech to the monthlong conference director 
general federico mayor said he would never allow the organization 
to be used for political purposes and vowed to work for freedom 
of expression that does not have any limits 
the spanish biochemist who took over the troubled agency two 
years ago also said he wanted to see disparities between 
industrialized and developing nations that threaten cultural 
diversity grow smaller and eventually disappear 
in other business the conference elected malaysian education 
minister anwar ibrahim as its chairman for the next two years and 
admitted the cook islands and kirbati in the pacific as the 160th 
and 161st members 
the conference which meets every two years will adopt a plan 
of activities for the first half of the 1990s and a program and 
budget for the next two years 
the united states and britain left unesco in the mid1980s 
because they said the organization had become too politicized 
spent too much money and was poorly managed under mayors 
predecessor amadou mahtar mbow of senegal 
singapore also withdrew saying it could spend its dues better 
elsewhere 
mayor hopes to end the decadelong controversy over the new 
world information and communication order which communications 
specialists say has been made obsolete by technological advances 
western governments and media organizations believe the new 
order could lead to press censorship and licensing of journalists 
developing countries said it was needed because western media 
reported about them unfairly and dominated information flows 
in his speech mayor also appealed for the release of all 
hostages journalists or not who have become pawns in an 
intolerable bargaining 
this seemed a reference to american and british hostages held in 
lebanon including terry anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press and british tv journalist 
john mccarthy

an international group approved a 
formal ban on ivory trade tuesday after a long bitter fight over 
how best to save the last elephant herds still roaming wild in 
africa 
the convention on trade in endangered species overrode 
objections from southern african governments which threatened to 
find alternative channels for selling ivory tusks 
this will be a great help said ian douglashamilton a 
nairobibased expert whose count of 609000 is the widely accepted 
estimate for african elephants less than half the 1979 total 
the african elephant is enormously better off today than it 
was a year ago because of international action he said 
unilateral import moratoriums in the united states and europe are 
already showing results 
but wlliam nduku head of zimbabwes parks and wildlife 
department called the vote a slap at the few countries which 
successfully protect their elephants and count on revenue from 
legal ivory sales 
he said zimbabwe might withdraw altogether from the convention 
known as cites delegates from south africa botswana burundi 
mozambique and malawi said their governments might file 
reservations to the ban allowing them to find buyers outside of 
the convention 
the compromise won preliminary approval monday on a 7611 vote 
with four abstentions the measure sets up a panel of experts to 
consider whether countries with wellmanaged herds might continue 
to trade legally in ivory 
the measure places elephants on the conventions appendix i 
banning trade in elephant products members have 90 days to file 
reservations which means they consider their elephants to be 
listed in appendix ii which allows trade 
some objecting countries said they would organize a southern 
african center for ivory marketing in botswana to sell ivory 
taken from culled elephants 
south africa also might market its ivory through the center 
overcoming political differences with its frontline neighbors 
for us appendix i is a dead end once our elephants are 
listed on it we will never get them off said pieter mulder 
chief of the south african delegation he said south africa will 
accept a twoyear moratorium on ivory sales until the next meeting 
of the convention but objected to a ban 
countries insisting on a ban including kenya tanzania and the 
united states argue that any legal trade would open loopholes and 
encourage poaching in critical areas 
japan which has consumed 40 percent of world ivory exports 
made no immediate comment although japan temporarily banned 
imports last month it could file a reservation and buy southern 
african ivory 
this vote was a crushing blow to the ivory market which is the 
critical factor in the fate of the elephants said craig van note 
of the washingtonbased monitor consortium a network of 
environmentalist groups now all nations and citizens must reject 
any product made from ivory 
the long dispute left africans split and in some cases bitter 
imagine a situation where trinidad and tobago are deciding the 
fate of african elephants said rowan martin director of 
research in zimbabwes wildlife department 
in south africa john ledger of the private endangered wildlife 
trust urged south africa to renounce all ivory sales 
the ivory trade is rotten to the core he said a statement 
from johannesburg 
by continuing to trade in ivory south africa finds itself in 
the company of ruthless poachers smugglers and criminals who will 
kill the last elephant in africa to satisfy their greed 
ivory is highly valued for its use in the signature stamps 
popular in many asian nations and for jewelry piano keys and 
carvings

parliament tuesday began debating bills 
designed to end 41 years of communist oneparty rule and 
opposition leaders presented petitions urging a delay of next 
months presidential election 
lawmakers considered constitutional amendments to eliminate all 
references to the leading role of the communist party and to bring 
the constitution in line with new legislation setting legal 
preconditions for multiparty elections due by june 1990 
earlier this month the communist party renamed itself the 
socialist party and committed itself to loosening its hold on power 
and allowing multiparty democracy 
the draft amendments before parliament would end the pattern of 
oneparty rule justice minister kalman kulcsar said 
parties will not be able to wield direct power he said 
adding that they would declare rights not doled out by the state 
but that are guaranteed for each citizen 
other bills before parliament include one on the functioning of 
political parties the establishment of a constitutional court and 
a new electoral law 
the body also plans to debate the creation of the office of 
state president a new post that would replace the collective 
presidential council of 21 members it also will discuss the rights 
of the new president and set the date for a free election to the 
post the date has tentatively been set for nov 26 
however before parliament opened its session members of the 
opposition league of free democrats presented more than 120000 
signatures on a petition calling for a referendum on the date and 
for a postponement until after next years national elections 
opposition leaders believe that a presidential vote held before 
the parliamentary elections would favor the communist candidate 
minister of state and popular reformer imre pozsgay 
under recently adopted legislation parliament must decide on 
calling a referendum within 60 days of receiving 100000 signatures 
on a given issue 
kulcsar instead suggested that parliament vote on the issue 
despite the receipt of the petition which opposition leaders say 
now bears nearly 200000 signatures 
he questioned the validity of the way signatures were collected 
noting that the date of the presidential election was only one of 
four questions requiring a collective yes or no answer 
maverick lawmaker zoltan kiraly also criticized the petition 
saying the inclusion of other questions about the partys assets 
and its armed guard the workers militia misled some signers 
members of the opposition league of free democrats which 
cosponsored the petition with the league of young democrats said 
it had been conducted properly and charged that kulcsar and kiraly 
were campaigning for the presidential post by making remarks 
broadcast on live television 
at the weekend the patriotic peoples front a mass social 
organization trying to shed its affiliation with the ruling party 
nominated kulcsar for president 
kiraly has been proposed by a local group of the small social 
democratic party but has denied being a presidential candidate 
peter toelgyessy of the free democrats said if the presidential 
elections went ahead without a referendum hungary would not be a 
state of law but a police state

president bushs personal physician says hed 
like to be us surgeon general but is out of the running because 
he disagrees with the president on abortion 
i would love the job dr burton j lee iii said in an 
interview tuesday but i couldnt take it if that had to be my 
position i wouldnt be able to work effectively and i couldnt do 
what the president wants that guy to do so i would have to say 
no 
i think its wrong lee said of such an abortion litmus 
test but what the hell a lot of people think its wrong 
shortly after he made his comments administration sources said 
bush had chosen antonia novello deputy director of the national 
institute of child health and human development to be surgeon 
general 
novello was undergoing routine background checks before her 
formal nomination said the sources who spoke only on condition of 
not being identified she was one of several women supported by lee 
for the job and he said she would be terrific if shes picked 
lee was the first administration official to state publicly that 
candidates to succeed c everett koop as surgeon general must 
conform with the presidents views on abortion 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said there is no litmus 
test on this or any other issue but she added that it is 
appropriate for people in sensitive positions to articulate the 
presidents policies 
administration officials also have asked at least one candidate 
for the post of director of the national institutes of health for 
his views on abortion according to the journal science 
chase untermeyer white house personnel chief said tuesday that 
potential nominees are asked their views on abortion if its 
pertinent and in almost every case there at the department of 
health and human services it is 
the presidents position on abortion and that of the 
republican party is well known and the american people knew that 
when he was a candidate untermeyer said therefore it is 
entirely appropriate for people being considered for appointments 
at hhs to be asked if they hold the same views as those of the 
president of the united states who would appoint them 
bush opposes abortion in most cases except instances of rape and 
incest or if the life of the mother is in jeopardy lee says he 
favors the right of a the mother to decide whether to have an 
abortion 
on the day lee commented white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater announced bush would veto legislation now on the verge 
of passage by congress that would loosen restrictions on the use 
of federal funds for abortion the bill would allow use of federal 
money for abortions in cases of rape and incest 
abortion also has emerged as a political issue in campaigns for 
governor in virginia and new jersey as well as in the race for 
mayor of new york city 
koop left office the beginning of this month after more than 
seven years as the governments top health official when he was 
named surgeon general by president reagan koop was regarded as a 
strong foe of abortion and the resulting uproar helped delay senate 
approval of the nomination for nine months 
by the time koop left office he was a hero to many of those who 
most strongly opposed his nomination as surgeon general koop 
angered conservatives when he advocated use of condoms and sex 
education to combat aids and when he refused to issue a report 
requested by reagan on whether women suffered psychological harm 
from abortion 
i never made any promises to espouse any causes koop said 
in an interview last spring 
lee said he discussed the surgeon general post with bush and 
ive disqualified myself from any consideration for a job like 
that because of my prochoice stand and hes aware of that 
he said he has proposed some 20 candidates for the surgeon 
generals job all of them women and all in agreement with bush on 
abortion 
all of the women whose names i have submitted have said they 
can make that statement said lee 
a former lymphatic cancer specialist at the sloane kettering 
cancer center in new york lee 59 maintains residences in 
greenwich conn and washington he travels with the president and 
directs a team of three doctors and nine other medical personnel 
bush and lee discussed the retirement of koop early in the year 
when koop first told the president of his plans to leave office 
we talked about it very early on lee said i told him i 
was really not a candidate because i couldnt fit in with the 
position he wanted to take on abortion he said thats 
probably the case 
lee said he saw no inconsistency with the presidents having a 
personal physician with prochoice views while requiring that the 
surgeon general be antiabortion and he said there has been no 
friction between him and the president on the issue 
im not dealing with legislation or public policy issues 
lee said i give credit to president bush for seeing that what he 
wants is the best physician and not first and foremost an ideologue 
on abortion

everyone is supposed to love a parade but 
baseball fans in oakland and san francisco have to ponder whether 
they can love a victory parade on the other side of the eightmile 
bay bridge 
fans of the oakland athletics werent dancing in the streets 
tuesday just because their american league champion team was ahead 
20 in the world series going into the night game here not after 
last year when the as postseason swagger was humbled by the los 
angeles dodgers 
we expected to win last year and so there is a little more 
cautious approach this year said sonny m ismail who works for 
the port of oakland just from observation everythings very 
quiet on the streets 
a taste of defeat also hampered the enthusiasm of san francisco 
fans who had been ecstatic over the giants first appearance in a 
world series since 1962 
my heart is with the giants said robin odonnell who works 
in san franciscos financial district and acknowledged tuesday that 
the odds didnt look good for a comeback 
i dont like it but im not a worrier said odonnell who 
plans to attend all the series games at candlestick park this week 
weve come back from worse situations than this 
both cities have made their parade plans but until the victory 
fireworks the most colorful signs of team pride are the green as 
flags that adorn streetlights and insignias of the team that can be 
seen in the windows of most restaurants in oakland 
oaklands been real reserved this year said tim gallen of 
celebrate oakland a group leading a promoteoakland campaign 
basically whats happening is everyones just waiting to erupt 
some fans have divided loyalties so a hot souvenir item has 
been a baseball cap that has the giants logo on one side and the 
as insignia on the other 
caltrans the state transportation agency tried a similar 
approach on a grander scale it put up small giants banners along 
the bay bridge route into san francisco and as flags along the 
bridge heading eastbound into oakland 
civic boosters say the game they are calling baysball is a 
nolose situation for the area 
i think theyre representing the whole bay area said lyle 
gordan a worker at cost plus nursery in oakland where he said 
nearly all his customers are talking about the two ballclubs 
of course there are always people who dont care about 
baseball even amid a world series 
while diehard fans were attending game 2 or watching on the 
252squarefoot television screen at jack london square in oakland 
marjorie fishkin was huddled in a wool coat and scarf in a line to 
see the new woody allen movie crimes and misdemeanors 
woody allen is a genius and im not interested in baseball 
she said 
darryl lindsey of oakland acknowledged hes not much of a 
baseball fan either and being originally from los angeles he 
hasnt followed the as much 
but if they do win the world series lindsey said he intends to 
be at the victory parade just to be able to say i was there

a sudanese court is asking the families 
of seven victims of a terrorist gangs bomb to decide whether the 
five palestinians convicted in the attack should live or die 
among the victims were a british couple and their two children 
whose relatives are quakers opposed to the death penalty 
but contrary to a statement last month by an appeals court they 
and the parents of a fifth british victim a teacher for a relief 
agency say they have not agreed to pardon the bombers 
the five britons and two sudanese died in may 1988 when a bomb 
blew the roof off a khartoum hotel dining room where the british 
victims and one of the sudanese were having dinner the other 
sudanese victim was a waiter 
dinah rolfe whose son daughterinlaw and two grandchildren 
died in the blast said in britain that she and her husband 
edward do not want the killers executed but she added we dont 
think its sensible to let them go free so that they can kill 
again 
ken rockett a retired music teacher whose daughter was killed 
said killing the terrorists would make them martyrs in their own 
country 
rockett said he had no desire to see them killed but added 
it is a terrible crime and should be punished 
the palestinians were caught after the bombing and a 
simultaneous machine gun attack on a nearby private club restricted 
to citizens of commonwealth nations 
they told investigators they were avenging the april 1988 
assassination by israeli commandos of khalil wazir also known as 
abu jihad who was military commander of the palestine liberation 
organization 
a year ago the palestinians were convicted of bombing and 
illegal possession of arms and were sentenced to hang 
the official sudan news agency this week quoted a judiciary 
source as saying the court of appeal has asked the government to 
notify families of the victims to appear jan 3 and say whether 
they want the sentence carried out 
at issue is a stipulation of sudans islamic law or sharia 
that came into effect with a recent appeals court order changing 
the assassination conviction to premeditated murder 
as islamic law based on the moslems holy book the koran and 
pronouncements of the prophet mohammed does not deal with the 
political crime of assassination 
but the sharia decrees that the family of a murder victim can 
decide whether the convicted person should be executed made to pay 
restitution and be pardoned or be pardoned outright 
sudan news agency said it was told that the court will order the 
five palestinians executed if the families do not appear at its 
january hearing the agencys source did not say what would happen 
if families disagree on the fate of the defendants 
when the court of appeal amended the charge it said relatives 
of christopher rolfe who was killed had pardoned the 
perpetrators in addition to rolfe the british victims were his 
wife clare their children thomas 3 and louise 1 and sally 
rockett a teacher

the parents of a slain state trooper 
say the republican candidate for governors campaign ignored their 
wishes by invoking their sons name and using film of his funeral 
in a commercial 
they wont even let him rest in peace thats all we want 
for him to rest in peace grace lamonaco said in an interview 
monday what kind of person could exploit a picture of a 
funeral 
the 30second television commercial for republican james courter 
features a photograph of philip lamonaco footage from his 1981 
christmas eve funeral and a brief interview with his widow donna 
the widow urges viewers to support courter on grounds that he 
will pursue a stronger death penalty she criticizes democrat james 
florio for being satisfied with the existing death penalty law 
the lamonacos said the ad has reopened the wound of their sons 
slaying they said the courter campaign knew they objected and say 
their wishes should have been respected regardless of the 
willingness of their daughterinlaw to appear in the ad 
if it wasnt for the commercial we wouldnt be going through 
all this again said joseph lamonaco breaking into tears during 
the interview at the couples home how can they bring something 
like this up in a political campaign 
ken connolly courters campaign manager said courter was not 
told of the parents objections 
they parents also said the commercial is misleading because it 
implies that their sons killers were spared the death penalty 
because of a flaw in the law the capital punishment law was not 
enacted until 1982 a year after his slaying 
donna lamonaco wrote a letter on pink stationery on behalf of 
courter during last springs primary election his campaign sent 
the letter to thousands of republican voters in a mailing that 
included a snapshot of the dead trooper 
when lamonacos parents heard of the letter they called courter 
and told connolly they did not want their sons name exploited for

hospitals and nursing homes would have to 
inform patients of their right to have living wills that spell 
out the intensity of medical treatment they desire when nearing 
death under legislation introduced tuesday in the senate 
for many people the last months of their lives realize the 
nightmares of their earlier years sen john danforth rmo 
said at a news conference where he unveiled the legislation 
the nightmare he said is that modern medicine is capable of 
prolonging the process of death for interminable periods of time 
that every shred of dignity is kept from human beings that people 
who have lived wonderful lives are required through no decision of 
their own to vegetate 
danforth said 40 states have living will laws but only 9 
percent of americans execute such documents 
he suggested that is more from americans lack of awareness 
about such matters rather than their lack of desire to have a say 
about what is done if they reach the point where life support 
systems are needed to keep them alive 
danforths bill cosponsored by sen daniel p moynihan 
dny would require all states to have living will legislation 
but would not spell out the provisions such measures must contain 
however it would require that hospitals and nursing homes that 
accept medicare and medicaid payments in essense every such 
institution in the nation inform patients when they check in 
about that particular states laws 
hospitals would also have to point out that patients have the 
right to designate someone to make decisions about their health 
care if the patient becomes unable to make such decisions 
danforth compared the disclosure to a sort of medical version of 
the miranda warning police must give people they arrest 
danforth said he expects debate over his bill to encourage 
people to make decisions before they become vulnerable to the 
decisions of medical technocrats

a moose that caught the fancy of iowans 
as it wandered southward for weeks hundreds of miles south of its 
normal range has been killed by a hunter who claimed self defense 
everyone is appalled that the moose was shot because everyone 
has been watching him from day one doug clayton a conservation 
officer for the state department of natural resources said tuesday 
the moose had been wandering southward through iowa since first 
being seen sept 22 near sheldon the mooses wanderings had taken 
him to downtown cherokee and into many iowa corn fields 
michael scott wiggins 27 of underwood was cited tuesday in 
pottawattamie county district court for shooting an animal out of 
season there are normally no moose in iowa and therefore no 
hunting season and having a centerfire rifle in his possession 
during a deer hunting season restricted to muzzleloading guns 
both citations are simple misdemeanors with a maximum penalty of 
100 fine or 30 days in jail said assistant county attorney tim 
markel the state will also seek 1000 in damages he said 
arraignment was set for oct 20 
wiggins who notified iowa department of natural resources 
officials about the shooting sunday said he encountered the bull 
moose in a soybean field east of underwood about 10 miles northest 
of council bluffs in southwestern iowa clayton said 
clayton investigated the shooting and said he is skeptical about 
wiggins claim that he shot the moose after it charged him 
he said the moose was charging north to south but we found 
moose tracks going east to west clayton said he also said the 
animal had not been killed with headon shots 
clayton said wiggins told him he had been hunting for a coyote 
with his 270caliber magnum rifle in his fathers soybean field 
when he looked up and saw the moose charging him 
richard mcgeough chief of the departments enforcement bureau 
said he also found it hard to accept wiggins explanation 
these animals routinely travel through the state and people 
line up on the highways and gawk and take pictures he said 
and of all these reports the people who shoot the moose are the 
only ones who say the moose charged them 
only three other moose all bulls have been reported in the 
state in the last dozen years their natural habitat is about 400 
miles north of iowa in the lakes and forests of northern 
minnesota underwood is about 150 south of the minnesota state line 
wiggins could not be reached for comment there was no answer at 
his fathers house 
officials said the moose would be stuffed and used in an 
educational display at the springbrook state park north of guthrie 
center 
state wildlife specialist lee gladfelder said the best theory is 
that the wandering bulls lost a contest for mating rights and were 
rejected by the rest of the herd 
but why some of the beasts travel south is a mystery he said 
of the other three moose in iowa one was shot by a farmer who was 
fined for killing a protected animal one died of natural causes 
and one wandered on to missouri and disappeared

the nations education secretary said tuesday 
that letting parents pick their childs school is the cornerstone 
of education reform but east harlem parents and a state educator 
told him choice is not enough 
education secretary lauro f cavazos was in the citys east 
harlem neighborhood to lavish praise on its impoverished school 
district which has gained fame for transforming crowded schools 
into 52 smaller magnet schools aimed at providing educational 
options 
but the choiceineducation message cavazos hoped to convey in 
the first stop of a fivecity road show became mired in politics as 
parents demanded an explanation for the loss of 14 million in 
federal magnet funds for their district the very funds designed 
to encourage the choice programs cavazos was praising 
at a 2hour meeting monday night at intermediate school 117 
parents told cavazos and city and state education officials that 
choice without adequate funding holds only hollow promise for 
improving schools 
the irony is that were celebrating choice at a time when 
were in a crisis in this district instead of increased support 
were getting less support said ray rivera who has two children 
in the districts schools 
at tuesdays concluding session some speakers stressed that 
expanding parental choice alone would not cure school ills 
at the risk of being branded an infidel choice is not 
enough said new york state education commissioner thomas sobol 
adequate resources need to be provided when the average 
elementary class size in new york city is 28 and outside the city 
it is 22 the quality of choice outside the city is likely to be 
greater and that has to end 
new jersey gov thomas kean who delivered one of the final 
speeches of the conference said choice isnt the be all and end 
all but there are too many schools that just dont work choice is 
the passageway to get from the schools of today to the schools of 
tomorrow 
cavazos himself said choice was just one of the strategies 
needed but he later told reporters choice by itself is a 
stimulus it creates competitive interaction 
president bush has called choice the single most promising 
idea in education today he and others argue that if parents are 
given the chance to choose schools the resulting competition will 
improve education everywhere 
at tuesdays session an east harlem group called parents for 
choice distributed leaflets saying they had been told by 
education department officials that the districts magnet fund 
grant proposal was weak and inadequate and therefore funds were 
not provided this year 
the district had received federal magnet grants the last two 
years without those funds district officials have said 30 
teaching and other staff jobs are in jeopardy 
education undersecretary ted sanders told reporters that the 
quality of magnet fund applications has improved making competition 
stiffer and that congress wants preference given to new applicants 
lon anderson a spokesman for the department said cavazos had 
nothing to do with awarding grants and the rejection of east 
harlems bid was absolutely no reflection on the quality of 
education programs in the district 
cavazoss visit was the first of five regional meetings on 
parental choice planned by the bush administration the other 
scheduled stops are in minneapolisst paul oct 2324 charlotte 
nc nov 1314 denver nov 1617 and richmond calif nov 
2829 
in 1972 east harlems community school district 4 ranked last 
among the citys 32 local school districts in standardized test 
scores and only 15 percent were reading at grade level today 
with parents able to choose among 52 magnet schools 66 percent are 
reading at grade level and the districts citywide rank has 
improved to 16th

president bush promised anew tuesday to help 
defend south korea against its communist neighbor he also nudged 
president roh tae woo to open south koreas markets wider to 
american competition 
the two leaders concluded 2hours of meetings and a luncheon at 
the white house with pledges to keep us troops there to help 
maintain peace on the korean peninsula 
bush pledged our forces will remain as long as there is a 
threat from the north he also applauded rohs creative 
diplomacy in proposing to create a commonwealth between north and 
south korea as a step toward reunification 
on trade the thorniest issue between the two allies bush said 
south korea is now the worlds 10th largest trading nation and 
americas seventh largest trading partner 
korean workers and companies have benefited from us open 
markets but american workers and companies deserve equal access to 
korean markets bush said at the ceremony in the east room with 
their wives and top cabinet members standing nearby 
roh speaking through an interpreter said i emphasized to 
president bush that in spite of many domestic difficulties the 
korean government with strong faith in free and fair trade has 
been moving toward economic liberalization and market opening 
what had been scheduled as a 10minute private meeting between 
the two leaders lasted 40 minutes and they spent another 30 
minutes with cabinet officials and top aides before a working 
luncheon 
richard solomon an assistant secretary of state who briefed 
reporters afterwards said that at one point roh used the 
analogy that if an apple is picked before it is ripe it can be a 
bit tough and sour when its ripe however its nice and sweet 
but bush rejoined we dont want the ripening to take so long 
that were too old to enjoy the food 
solomon said roh indicated that he will continue to 
liberalize with a goal of making south koreas market as open by 
the mid1990s as markets are now in the major western industrial 
nations 
roh also noted that the us trade deficit with south korea was 
down in august by a third from last years level 
bush indicated his hopes for rapid progress in the areas of 
telecommunications and implementation of intellectual property 
rights solomon said 
asked about the prospects for getting more us agricultural 
goods into south korea solomon said thats an area where it may 
take from the korean perspective a little longer for the apple 
to ripen 
bush said the division of korea is merely a part of a great 
divide between all the nations of the world 
roh said both he and bush shared the view that a new breeze of 
reform and openness currently blowing is spreading freedom in 
the socialist world 
we noted the stark reality however that despite this 
encouraging trend of change confrontation and tension have not 
abated on the korean peninsula said roh 
talk of a reduced us military deployment has become more 
commonplace as south korea becomes more prosperous and the soviet 
union appears less menacing than before moscow has close links to 
seouls archrival north korea 
south korea has made strides toward democracy in the past two 
years but human rights groups claim there has been an increase in 
repression lately roh has defended the arrest of several hundred 
dissidents in recent months saying they had violated the law 
six antiamerican radicals staged a bold attack on the us 
ambassadors residence in seoul last week 
the white house was ringed with police as several dozen young 
koreans demonstrated in nearby lafayette park in protest of the roh 
visit 
bush met with roh in seoul last february a month after bushs 
inauguration roh will have breakfast with vice president dan 
quayle before addressing a joint session of congress wednesday his 
fiveday visit to the united states ends thursday

shortfall increased to 1077 billion in august up 3077 percent 
from a revised july deficit of 824 billion many economists had 
expected the deficit to be about 9 billion 
larry wachtel a vice president at prudentialbache securities 
inc attributed todays retreat largely to concerns that the us 
trade deficit was worsening and could lead to higher interest rates 
but not all analysts agreed that the trade deficit was a major 
factor in todays decline some noted that bonds and the dollar 
which are most sensitive to bad trade figures held up relatively 
well 
the dollar recovered after a sharp drop that followed the trade 
report while bonds were mixed an indication that investors were 
not seriously worried about worsening inflation and higher interest 
rates 
the federal reserve injected 15 billion into the banking 
system today after adding 2 billion in reserves on monday 
banks will be able to use the new reserves to come to the

employeemanagement buyout proposal for the parent of united 
airlines the stock fell another 2567 a share to 19725 after 
tumbling about 57 a share monday and that contributed to the 
overall market weakness

while many smaller issues continued to lose ground 
declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 5to4 margin 
on the new york stock exchange indexes of the american stock 
exchange and overthecounter stocks fell

record 508 points off the dow average that did not turn out to be 
the case 
stocks rallied today in tokyo in response to wall streets 
strength of monday but londons market lost ground in sympathy 
with todays weakness on the new york stock exchange 
in tokyo where tuesday trading ended before new york opened for 
business the nikkei average jumped 52739 points or 15 percent

the senate judiciary committee voted tuesday 
to commemorate the massacre of more than a million armenians 75 
years ago approving a resolution sure to anger turkey and the bush 
administration 
before passing the measure on an 86 vote the panel rejected an 
effort by sen howard metzenbaum dohio to soften its language by 
eliminating the word genocide 
metzenbaum said he offered his substitute at the suggestion of 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser 
scowcroft met monday with sen bob dole rkan the resolutions 
sponsor to discuss the issue 
the dole measure would set april 24 1990 to memorialize the 
15 million armenians who were killed between 1915 and 1923 during 
the ottoman empire 
the bush administration concerned that the resolution could 
damage relations between the united states and turkey lobbied 
behind the scenes to defeat the measure even bringing back the 
us ambassador to work against it 
publicly however the state department took no position on the 
resolution 
president bush found himself in a jam over the resolution 
because he had voiced support for language marking the armenian 
genocide during the 1988 campaign 
the measure which now goes to the senate floor aroused strong 
feelings among americans of turkish and armenian ancestry 
i became the focal point for the greatest lobbying campaign 
ive experienced in a long while said sen alan simpson rwyo 
metzenbaum suggested replacing the word genocide with a 
national day of remembrance for armenians 
genocide means a deliberate and systematic elimination of a 
racial group he said i dont think thats really what occurred 
here some historians have rejected the idea of a genocide 
but sen joe biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
said the only debate is whether it was attempted genocide or 
genocide 
and sen paul simon dill said people were massacred 
because of their ancestry in the ottoman empire 
sen orrin hatch rutah failed in his attempt to transfer the 
resolution to the senate foreign relations committee saying the 
judiciary committee did not have the expertise to understand the 
foreign policy ramifications of the measure 
the turkish government had strongly opposed the resolution 
believing it was tantamount to comparing that nations history to 
nazi germany

united nations the soviet union abstained tuesday on the 
annual vote to seat israel instead of opposing it as usual but 
tempered the sign of better relations by repeating its disapproval 
of israeli policy in the middle east 
it was the first time since 1982 the soviets did not join arab 
nations in voting to reject israels credentials for the 159member 
general assembly israel has been un member since the jewish 
state was founded in 1948 
the vote in the assembly was 9537 to seat israel with 15 
abstentions and 12 nations not voting last years vote was 9541 
with seven abstentions and 16 absent 
credentials of all nations must be approved each year and the 
annual challenge to israel has become a ritual 
although the kremlin did not support israel the changed vote 
was considered a victory for the israelis and a setback for the 
arabs 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov said later his 
government had given a signal to the government of israel that it 
is high time to listen to the world community and heed un 
resolutions on the middle east 
the ball is in israels court and it is up to them to make 
their assessement and take certain concrete decisions he said 
belonogov said dropping opposition to israels credentials did 
not mean a change in soviet views on israels middle east policy or 
presage resumption of the diplomatic relations severed in the 1967 
middle east war 
israeli intransigence in middle east peace efforts and its 
refusal to talk to the palestine liberation organization make 
resumption of formal ties impossible despite warmer unofficial 
relations he said 
israeli diplomats had said the soviet vote would be a test of 
its intention to improve relations and play a constructive role in 
the middle east peace process 
byelorussia and the ukraine the soviet unions other two votes 
in the general assembly joined the switch turkey which abstained 
last year supported israel in tuesdays vote 
ambassador johanan bein of israel called the soviet change of 
heart a move in the right direction yes definitely positive 
in jerusalem foreign minister moshe arens issued a statement 
praising the positive attitude of the soviet union that found 
expression in the vote 
clovis maksoud representative of the arab league described the 
new soviet position on the challenge to israel as regrettable 
but called it a tactical change that did not alter moscows 
support for the arab position 
us ambassador thomas r pickering a former ambassador to 
israel said the soviet abstention is a good sign a yes vote 
would have been better

motorcyclists and state officials joined 
tuesday in opposing legislation to withhold some federal highway 
aid from states without mandatory automobile seatbelt and 
motorcycle helmet laws 
the cyclists told a hearing of a senate environment and public 
works subcommittee that most states either have helmet laws or are 
on their way to doing so the cyclists also argued that riders 
edcuation programs have helped reduce fatalities over the last 
eight years by 35 percent 
issues of highway safety and personal freedom have 
traditionally and rightfully been resolved by state governments 
and the imposition of the proposed law is a violation of states 
rights said robert rasor vice president for governmental 
relations of the american motorcyclist association of westerville 
ohio 
at issue is legislation sponsored by sen john r chafee 
rri to empower the transportation department to withhold up to 
10 percent of a states federal highway aid unless it required 
motorcylists to wear helmets and all frontseat automobile 
passengers to wear safety belts 
chafee said that nearly 50000 people are killed on the highways 
each year the national highway traffic safety administration 
estimates that 20000 lives have been saved over the last five 
years through the wearing of motorcycle helmets and automobile 
safety belts 
public health groups physicians and the insurance industry 
support chafees proposal 
our taxes pay more than 9 billion each toward the care of 
injured motor vehicle occupants and motorcyclists susan p baker 
of the johns hopkins injury prevention center in baltimore told the 
subcommittee on water resources transportation and infrastructure 
but represenatives of state government and other opponents of 
sanctions contained in the proposed national highway fatality and 
injury reduction act of 1989 argued that the sanctions would be 
counterproductive 
adding to the list of ways in which a state can jeopardize 
funding for transportation including safety only limits the 
states ability to find the most effective combination of laws 
regulations and educational efforts to encourage driver and 
passenger safety said virginia state sen charles wadell 
representing the national conference of state legislators 
robert ford of the massachusettsbased freedom first group 
which fought successfully for repeal of that states seatbelt law 
argued that reducing highway aid would make roads more hazardous 
the insurance industrys insurance institute for highway safety 
says that only 16 states dont now have mandatory seatbelt laws 
twentytwo states and the district of columbia have helmet laws 
applying to all riders three states colorado illinois and iowa 
dont have helmet laws the rest have laws covering riders under 
a certain age which varies from state to state

for reform in south africa which quit the commonwealth in 1961 
the african national congress the main group fighting white 
domination in south afrida urged the commonwealth to impose more 
sanctions and indicated its hitandrun guerrilla attacks may

it is very important to pay attention to the question of 
building up the military capacity to conduct a sustained armed 
struggle not merely to carry out an operation once in a while 
however spectacular said thabo mbeki the organizations 
spokesman on foreign affairs 
mrs thatcher is likely to dominate the 40th anniversary summit 
as she has in the past 
many delegates said they were prepared to give south africas 
new president fw de klerk six months to deliver on promises of 
radical reforms following sundays release of several leading black 
nationalists 
british officials said mrs thatcher felt a deadline would be 
wholly artificial 
youre not going to solve the south african question in six 
months its going to take some time one said 
commonwealth countries have led the push for international 
action against apartheid south africas official policy of racial 
segregation 
britain says recent progress toward political settlements in 
namibia angola and mozambique should not be jeopardized by forcing 
south africa into a corner 
the way forward is not to set it back and not to put artifical 
deadlines upon people the official said you must allow the 
reform process to go forward to prove its worth 
sir shridath ramphal commonwealth secretarygeneral indicated 
in a briefing before mrs thatchers arrival that environmental 
issues might eclipse the south africa question he said 
environmental problems were of such wide concern it could be in 
some respects a crisis agenda

soviet journalists threatened a strike and a group 
of legislators on tuesday accused president mikhail s gorbachev of 
using pressure tactics in his rebuke of some prominent 
outspoken editors 
the 58yearold kremlin leader facing growing public discontent 
over economic decline despite his reforms lashed out at the press 
at a time when it is providing increasingly frank coverage of the 
countrys problems 
the attack came at a closeddoor meeting and appeared to be an 
attempt by the leadership to regain a measure of control over the 
media which daily carry reports critical of the system and 
occasionally of its leaders 
soviet journalists said gorbachev accused the editors of working 
against the communist party or of seeking his political downfall at 
a time when the nation is being torn by economic crisis ethnic 
strife and calls from some quarters for secession from the union 
one journalist said gorbachev likened the situation in the 
country to a lake of gasoline that could be set afire by a single 
match he was quoted as saying the people need moral guidance from 
the media in this critical period 
since coming to power in march 1985 gorbachev has repeatedly 
called for more open expression and has relaxed some political 
control over the media but he also has said his policy of 
glasnost or openness has limits he has condemned extremist views 
appearing in the media 
the journalists speaking on condition they not be identified 
told western colleagues gorbachevs accusations came at a toplevel 
meeting friday with representatives of state media creative unions 
and agencies charged with formulating ideology at the communist 
party central committee it could mean the frank criticism spawned 
by glasnost may now be ruled off limits they said 
the soviet public has not been told of gorbachevs remarks the 
official news agency tass reported gorbachev spoke but the text 
was not distributed and no details appeared in the soviet press 
the journalists said gorbachev aimed some of his toughest 
criticism at vladislav a starkov editor of the weekly tabloid 
arguments and facts and suggested he resign it is the countrys 
most popular newspaper with a circulation of 26 million gorbachev 
also demanded he be given all letters critical of him that were 
sent to the newspaper 
using readers mail arguments and facts recently calculated 
that human rights activist andrei d sakharov was more popular than 
gorbachev or any other member of the soviet congress 
starkov was given an additional dressingdown at a meeting 
monday with chief party ideologist vadim a medvedev the 
journalists said they said medvedev also told starkov he must go 
and offered him a job at the state publishing committee but 
starkov will fight to stay put 
journalists at arguments and facts said they are considering a 
walkout after completing work on next weeks issue unless 
gorbachev backs off and hope other journalists would join them 
nikolai a kutsenko a member of the supreme soviet the 
national legislature gathered at least 30 lawmakers signatures 
tuesday on a petition to gorbachev defending arguments and facts 
it accuses gorbachev of using pressure tactics against the 
newspaper that it said conflict with his drive to democraticize 
soviet society it also accuses gorbachev of trying to discredit 
the weekly 
arguments and facts was responsible for several sensational 
stories in the past year including the first soviet disclosure 
that dictator josef stalin imprisoned or killed as many as 40 
million people it was the first soviet publication to print 
excerpts of the memoirs of nikita s khrushchev the late former 
prime minister 
soviet journalists quoted their bosses who attended as saying 
gorbachev also tore into some other stars including ogonyok weekly 
editorinchief vitaly korotich historian yuri afanasyev and 
reformist economists gavriil popov and nikolai shmelev 
he accused afanasyev popov and shmelev members of the 
legislatures opposition group of joining with populist communist 
legislator boris n yeltsin to form a fascist clique striving for 
power they said 
gorbachev reportedly said that afanasyev rector of moscow 
historical archives institute should be thrown out of the 
communist party 
one source described the president as shouting when he accused 
korotich of breaking a personal promise not to mention yeltsin in 
print 
gorbachev also reportedly called the editorial board of the 
moskovsky komsomolets newspaper a nest of informal antiparty 
organizations the paper is published by the komsomol young 
communist league in moscow

states may be faced with two sets of numbers 
for congressional redistricting under a court agreement aimed at 
adjusting the 1990 census for an historical undercount of 
minorities a house panel was told tuesday 
the potential of two sets of figures also may influence whether 
the commerce secretary makes the adjustment official daniel 
melnick and david huckabee told the house post office subcommittee 
on census and population 
the panel is studying whether legislation is needed to correct 
any problems with last julys court agreement over the census 
adjustment the agreement stemmed from a lawsuit seeking to force 
the commerce department to adjust the census for its historical 
undercount of minorities 
the census bureau has been criticized for missing from 1 percent 
to 2 percent of the population in the 1980 census and as much as 5 
percent of minorities because some people do not respond to 
questionnaires or refuse to cooperate with canvassers 
new york city for instance has estimated that the 1980 census 
missed up to 500000 of its residents costing the city 52 million 
a year in federal funds that are awarded on the basis of 
population the census figures are also used to determine the 
number of congressional seats that states gain or lose 
in a report analyzing the agreement melnick and huckabee who 
work for the congressional research service of the library of 
congress raised key questions about it 
questions included whether states should begin drawing district 
lines with initial counts or wait until the commerce secretary 
decides whether to adjust the figures 
by law the census bureau must provide the president with an 
overall national head count by dec 31 1990 and the states with 
localized breakdowns by april 1 1991 
under the july agreement however the census bureau will also 
perform a followup survey of 150000 households to find and 
correct any undercount if the commerce secretary decides to make 
the adjustment official the adjusted numbers would be released to 
the states no later than july 15 1991 
the government analysts also raised the question of whether 
states should change the dates by which they must adopt new 
district guidelines 
to effect these changes should states change the dates of 
their primaries in 1992 or the dates by which candidates must file 
their intention to run the report asked

a data bank to help hospitals and other 
healthcare providers keep track of incompetent physicians 
dentists and other practitioners is due to go on line early next 
year the department of health and human services announced tuesday 
the national practitioner data bank will reduce the ability of 
incompetent medical practitioners to avoid scrutiny by moving to 
another jurisdiction but will protect confidentiality hhs 
secretary louis sullivan said 
the public citizen health research group said the data bank was 
a good thing but complained that the information in it would 
not be available to most of the public 
lynn soffer a research associate with the health group said 
access to the information would be limited to hospitals licensing 
boards and other healthcare entities and to individuals who are 
subjects of reports 
i think some basic information should be available to the 
public from the bank soffer said if a patient knows their 
doctor was kicked off the staff they deserve to have some basic 
information on this 
the data bank will contain information concerning malpractice 
payments made on behalf of physicians dentists and other 
healthcare practitioners as well as information on actions taken 
by state boards against the licenses of physicians and dentists 
hospitals and other healthcare facilities and professional 
societies will be required to report their review actions 
concerning professional competence or conduct that affect the 
clinical privileges or membership of physicians or other 
healthcare practitioners reports must be made within 30 days from 
the date of the payment or action 
also hospitals must consult the data bank each time a 
physician dentist or other healthcare practitioner applies for a 
medical staff position or clinical privileges hospitals also must 
request information every two years on the practitioners on its 
medical staff and those who have clinical privileges 
the data bank will be operated by unisys corp under a 
fiveyear 159 million contract

the bush administration wants to require 
automobile companies to manufacture but not necessarily sell cars 
that burn cleaner fuels than gasoline an environmental protection 
agency official said tuesday 
seeking to clarify the administrations position on a key 
element of the presidents clean air bill william g rosenberg 
assistant epa administrator for air and radiation told a senate 
committee bush opposes an amendment endorsed by a house 
subcommittee last week 
the amendment would eliminate bushs requirement that automakers 
build and sell a million cars a year to run on alternative fuels 
such as methanol and compressed natural gas the cars would be sold 
in the nations smoggiest cities 
lawmakers friendly to the auto and oil industries pushed the 
amendment which environmentalists said would weaken the bill 
confusion arose during last weeks meeting of the house energy 
and commerce environment subcommittee which approved the amendment 
1210 when the administration appeared to send conflicting signals 
on its position 
rep norman lent rny said white house chief of staff john 
sununu had told him the administration was neutral on the 
amendment but rep henry waxman dcalif said epa administrator 
william reilly had voiced opposition 
during tuesdays hearing of the senate committee on energy and 
natural resources rosenberg said the administration would support 
the house amendment only with major changes 
under the house amendment sponsored by reps ralph hall 
dtexas and jack fields rtexas automakers would have to certify 
they could build the cleanfuel cars but would not have to make 
them rosenberg said the administration wants the cars actually 
built but would agree to drop the requirement that the autos be 
sold 
automakers have fought the sales requirements saying there is 
no guarantee the public would buy the cars 
the administration also wants the bill to establish a twopart 
system for phasing in use of cleanfuel cars rosenberg said for 
the immediate future cars burning a combination of gasoline and 
clean fuels such as methanol would be acceptable over the long 
term epa would establish auto emission standards based entirely on 
clean fuel use 
we are confident that with these changes the fieldshall 
amendment will achieve environmental benefits comparable to the 
administrations proposal rosenberg said until these 
adjustments are made part of the fieldshall amendment the 
administration continues to support the presidents original 
propsal in both the senate and the house

environmental activists in communist 
bulgaria have for the first time been allowed to campaign publicly 
against a government industrial project in a scenic mountain area 
diplomats in that country said tuesday 
observers speculated that bulgarian authorities made the move to 
create a positive impression at a 35nation conference on the 
european environment that opened monday in sofia 
the diplomats speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity 
said activists from the unsanctioned ecoglasnost group have worked 
freely since saturday in sofia bulgarias capital they said at 
least 1400 signatures had been collected on petitions against the 
project 
ecoglasnost has been refused permission to register as an 
official organization it was formed after several hundred 
activists got together last year to protest pollution in the danube 
river city of ruse and to campaign for cleaner air in sofia 
addressing the conference tuesday british chief delegate 
anthony williams said ecoglasnost has not been allowed to 
register and some of its members have suffered harassment 
we urge the bulgarian government to avoid harassment and 
to allow ecoglasnost and other similar groups to carry out their 
activities a british diplomat in sofia reached by telephone 
quoted williams as saying 
the current petition campaign is directed against construction 
of a hydrolectric plant in the rila mountains about 75 miles 
southwest of sofia the area is home to a 13th century monastery 
famous for its painted icons 
the government project was allowed despite official pledges in 
the 1970s to keep the mountains a natural park and preserve 
the bulgarian environmental activists plan to present their 
petitions to parliament and start legal action against the project 
a bulgarian emigre said on condition of anonymity 
the conference the first of its kind was being attended by the 
35 signatories to the 1975 helsinki final act the united states 
canada the soviet union and european nations 
among topics on the agenda are preventive measures against 
industrial accidents in border areas and pollution of international 
waterways

the head of the navy technical team that 
looked into the cause of the killer blast aboard the uss iowa 
believes it most probably was caused by a chemically ignited 
explosive device the navy said tuesday 
capt joseph d miceli headed the navy team that conducted some 
20000 tests to determine the cause of the explosion that claimed 
the lives of 47 sailors last april 
last month the navy issued a report on the blast but said it 
was unable to cite a specific cause of the explosion 
navy spokesman cmdr mark baker said the service stands by that 
report 
he said that while it is micelis personal opinion that a 
chemically explosive device was used to set off the explosion the 
captain was unable to prove that was the case 
he was not able to pin it down to a specific cause through the 
tests baker said 
it is micelis personal opinion that the cause of the iowa 
explosion was most probably a chemical device the spokesman 
said however he does not expect to be able to identify a 
specific device as the cause of the explosion 
rear adm richard milligan issued the navys report on the 
blast saying its experts concluded that gunners mate clayton 
hartwig was the most likely person with the access knowledge and 
possible motivation to have set off the fireball in the 
battleships no 2 gun turret 
the navy described hartwig was a loner who was upset about 
the breakup of a friendship with another sailor 
milligan said it appeared that hartwig had placed some type 
of explosive device between the first and second bags of gunpowder 
but that he could not cite with certainty what made up the device 
under questioning by reporters milligan said it could have been 
constructed of such simple materials as steel wool and hydraulic 
brake fluid 
hartwigs family and some members of congress have found fault 
with the navys study and demanded a congressional investigation 
on tuesday sen howard metzenbaum dohio said i am tired 
of seeing the navy convict clayton hartwig on no evidence simply 
because it does not have any idea as to what caused the tragic 
explosion on the iowa 
after conducting 20000 tests of black powder and the 
propellant used to fire the guns the navy has not produced any 
evidence that an explosive device was placed in the gun nor have 
they produced a shred of evidence that hartwig was responsible for 
the explosion the senator said 
the washington post said in its tuesday editions that 
congressional sources say navy experts have theorized that hartwig 
put something that would serve as an oxidizer like some cleaning 
powders on a steel wool pad and then put something that would 
serve as a fuel like hydraulic brake fluid or hair cream in a 
plastic vial knowing the two elements would ignite when combined 
according to the theory reported in the post he then slipped 
the combination into a lead foil sack that was inserted between the 
first and second bags of gunpowder and made sure the bags were 
rammed deeper than usual into the gun barrel to ensure the vial 
would break 
milligan decided to release his report last month after navy 
technical experts found foreign material in a ring inside the 
barrel of the 16inch gun that exploded believing that was enough 
evidence to make the case that the explosion was most probably 
caused by human intervention the navy said 
the navy has continued to try to nail down the precise makeup of 
the device that caused the explosion and baker said all of 
micelis information had been shared with milligan prior to his 
release of the report 
the navy also said it has been cooperating with a general 
accounting office study of its navy report which has been going on 
for several weeks

the senate armed services committee indicated 
tuesday it planned to recommend full senate confirmation of 
president bushs nominees to a new board overseeing safety in the 
energy departments troubled nuclear weapons program 
in a related development energy secretary james d watkins said 
he was dispatching teams of independent inspectors to nuclear 
weapons facilities in missouri nevada and ohio as part of a 
continuing effort to root out environmental problems 
the five nominees to the defense nuclear facilities safety board 
encountered no tough grilling in their brief senate confirmation 
hearing tuesday several members said they were limiting their 
questions because they wanted the board to start its work as soon 
as possible 
panel members uniformly praised the nominees but a vote was 
delayed by senate floor action 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the committee said the 
boards role was critical to the future of safe operations at 
the weapons complex which includes 17 major production facilities 
and laboratories in 12 states much of the system has been plagued 
with management technical and safety problems for several years 
congress created the safety board last year as a remedy to slack 
oversight of the weapons program by the energy department which 
owns all the facilities but hires private companies to run them 
the nominees are john t conway recently retired executive vice 
president of the new york utility consolidated edison edson g 
case a former official of the nuclear regulatory commission and a 
veteran of the nuclear navy john w crawford jr a 10year 
veteran of the navys nuclear propulsion program andrew j 
eggenberger a former engineer at the idaho national engineering 
laboratory and herbert jc kouts an expert in us and 
international nuclear safety issues 
conway who will be chairman of the panel if confirmed said a 
top priority of the group will be to oversee the energy 
departments plan for restarting the tritiumproducing nuclear 
reactors at the savannah river site near aiken sc the reactors 
have been closed for more than a year for safety improvements 
conway said he also expected the panel to become involved 
quickly in issues at the rocky flats plutonium processing plant 
near denver that is accused of serious environmental violations and 
is overloaded with nuclear waste 
in announcing plans to send environmental tiger teams to 
three weapons sites later this month watkins said officials of the 
environmental protection agency and the states of missouri ohio 
and nevada had been invited to observe the inspections watkins did 
not say exactly when the investigations would begin 
the sites to be inspected are the kansas city plant at kansas 
city mo which produces nonnuclear components for the weapons 
program the nevada test site where underground nuclear weapons 
tests are conducted and the portsmouth uranium enrichment plant at 
piketon ohio which makes fuel for nuclear reactors 
watkins in recent months started similar investigations of 
several other weapons plants

the bush administration said tuesday it is 
seeking an understanding with congress to ease restrictions on 
american involvement in foreign coups that might result in the 
death of a countrys leader 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the proposed 
changes would not alter a longstanding executive order banning us 
involvement in assassinations but would allow the cia to have 
contact with plotters of a coup in which a foreign leader might be 
killed 
theres a wide variety of interpretations and issues to be 
discussed fitzwater said 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said there is some vagueness in the policy he said 
he would welcome a request from bush to clear up any ambiguity 
the issue took on new urgency in the wake of the failed coup 
attempt against panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega on oct 3 
administration officials complained that cia officers in panama 
were essentially prevented from advising the coup plotters because 
of the possibility that noriega might be killed 
president bush at a news conference last week signaled he 
wanted to see the restrictions relaxed i want as broad a power 
as possible and i think under the constitution the president has 
it he said last friday 
bush said his powers were broader than some in the senate or 
house might think adding i may have a difference with some on 
interpreting what the powers of the president might be 
on capitol hill sen william cohen of maine senior republican 
on the senate intelligence committee said it may be time to review 
the interpretation of the executive order on assassinations but 
that the order itself should not be changed 
i dont want to see us getting into the assassination business 
by another name cohen said 
separately boren said he supported giving bush any authority 
that is truly needed to meet his responsibilities as commander in 
chief 
boren said when anybody overthrows a government i dont 
think that by the farthest stretch of the imagination should be 
covered 
us officials are extremely reluctant to publicly discuss 
intelligence matters particularly subjects such as coups and 
assassinations however cia director william h webster in an 
interview with the new york times openly said he would like to see 
the restrictions eased 
quickly endorsing the comments fitzwater said we certainly 
are in agreement with everything judge webster said yesterday 
what he said was that there are interpretations and 
discussions and understandings with the hill that should be 
reconsidered in light of their impact on coup activities the 
spokesman added 
webster was quoted as saying he wanted rules devised so that cia 
officers authority was so clearly defined that they can go right 
up to the edge of that authority and not worry if they or their 
agency is going to get into trouble 
webster said that under the current interpretation of the 
executive order the united states could not devise a plan for the 
assassination of noriega or hire an individual or group who wants 
to kill him 
now it begins to get a little tighter when you say heres a 
group that says it doesnt plan to kill him but theyre going to 
have to play rough and it could happen webster said now 
were in the area that has to be addressed 
fitzwater confirmed that the administration was discussing the 
situation with congressional leaders but said were not willing 
to talk about details publicly 
however asked whether he was talking about a situation in which 
the united states would not carry out an assassination but might be 
a party to a coup that might lead to the death of a foreign leader 
fitzwater said yes thats right 
the executive order prohibiting us involvement in 
assassination attempts was signed by president ford in 1976 after 
congressional investigations detailed the cias role in 
assassination plots against cuban president fidel castro and others 
the order was strengthened by president carter and adopted 
without change by president reagan 
bush invited the leaders of the senate intelligence committee 
boren and cohen to the white house last week to stress that he 
wants to work cooperatively with the panel

met privately at a local hotel the report said 
however their were no details on their meeting the agency said 
mubarak did not talk to reporters when he returned late tuesday to 
cairo airport 
the two leaders began their reconciliation in may when they met 
privately at an arab summit in morocco the last time an egyptian 
leader went to libya was when anwar sadat made the trip in 1971

they were easing formalities for travel between their two countries

allowing a radical palestinian group to insult egypt from its 
soil the middle east news agency said 
asked if relations with syria could improve as they did with 
libya mubarak said i know president hafez assad of syria 
well and i know others there well and there is no problem with 
them except that i blame them for letting george habash insult 
egypt from damascus 
mubarak was referring to a warning made in the syrian capital on 
oct 9 by habash chief of the marxistoriented popular front for 
the liberation of palestine 
in his comments habash rejected a plan put forward by mubarak 
for middle east peace 
he also said the egyptian president could suffer the same fate 
as his predecessor anwar sadat who was assassinated by moslem 
extremists in 1981 after the 1979 peace treaty with israel 
syria and libya are the only two of 17 arab countries that have 
failed to restore ties with egypt after breaking them over the 
treaty

legislators gave overwhelming preliminary approval 
tuesday to a bill that would scrap decades of communist orthodoxy 
by allowing people to own factories and farmers to pass leased land 
on to their children 
the landmark legislation stopped short of permitting widespread 
private property which some members advocated and said all land 
still would belong to the state 
by a vote of 30929 with 34 abstentions the supreme soviet 
approved the bill and sent it to a commission headed by president 
mikhail s gorbachev which will edit the legislation and publish 
it for nationwide discussion before final action 
strict ideologists say marxist principle stipulates that all 
means of production belong to society as a whole and that private 
ownership leads to exploitation 
under the legislation approved tuesday citizens may own their 
means of production and pursue individual and other kinds of 
economic activity the official news agency tass reported 
it did not define means of production but the term generally 
means equipment and factories 
farm families would have the right to pass land leased from the 
state to future generations and the legislation would permit 
jointstock and other forms of private ownership tass reorted 
allowing farmers to pass leased land along was suggested by the 
communist party central committee 
some deputies pressed for complete legalization of private 
property as a means of providing incentives for employees to work 
harder 
the bill says land and natural resources will be joint property 
of the nation as a whole and the individual republics involved 
deputies from the independenceminded baltic republics of 
latvia lithuania and estonia want exclusive ownership they say 
moscow has abused land and resources in the past and the republics

the baltics have won central government approval for control 
over their own economies beginning next year 
some private enterprise in the form of cooperatives already is 
allowed and the supreme soviet passed legislation tuesday governing 
those businesses 
one law bars cooperatives from buying manufactured goods and 
food from the state and reselling it for profit another imposed 
price controls on cooperatives to prevent gouging

a woman who was sentenced to 25 years in 
prison after pleading guilty to killing her livein boyfriend who 
she said beat her has pleaded guilty a second time and been 
allowed to go free 
susan j scott 36 was a free woman monday for the first time 
since the slaying of frederick e bickling 43 in september 1986 
scott has always maintained that she was a battered woman and 
feared bickling would kill her 
kent county superior court judge john e babiarz jr who 
sentenced her after her first guilty plea in may 1988 this week 
accepted a prosecution recommendation to resentence her to time 
already served three years and 26 days and seven years 
probation 
i know now that you were abused by him to a certain 
extent babiarz told scott i am not about to characterize how 
much or how little but i am satisfied you are less culpable than i 
thought you were last year 
scott first pleaded guilty to manslaughter a week before she was 
to be tried on a charge of firstdegree murder 
scotts family later fired her lawyer and retained richard l 
ducote a new orleans attorney who specializes in abuse cases 
earlier this year ducote asked babiarz to allow scott to 
withdraw her guilty plea alleging the first attorney did not give 
her adequate representation and should have argued that scott 
suffered from battered woman syndrome and shot bickling in 
selfdefense 
scott was allowed to withdraw her original plea and jury 
selection was scheduled to begin monday for a new firstdegree 
murder trial at the last minute deputy attorney general james 
rambo again offered a plea bargain and scott agreed to plead 
guilty to manslaughter a second time she also waived her 56000 
share of bicklings life insurance policy 
scott issued a statement saying she should have fled the 
relationship with bickling 
i admit that my recklessnness led to the death of fred 
bickling she said when he began abusing me i was reckless in 
remaining in the relationship when the pattern of abuse got worse 
i was reckless in not leaving him and seeking help for battered 
women

a government report published tuesday cleared 
austrian president kurt waldheim of allegations he was involved in 
the executions of british prisoners in greece while serving as a 
german army officer in 1944 
armed forces minister archie hamilton told parliament 16 
investigators examined thousands of documents provided by the 
united states west germany and greece their 117page report 
concluded waldheim could not be held responsible for the prisoners 
execution though he was probably aware of their fate 
hamilton said the lengthy investigation failed to find evidence 
pointing to a war crime by waldheim when he was a lieutenant 
serving as an intelligence officer in the balkans 
prime minister margaret thatcher ordered the inquiry in february 
1988 
the justice department said in washington that waldheim would 
still be banned from entering the united states his name was 
placed on the unwanted list in april 1987 after a finding he was 
involved in the execution of allied prisoners and the deportation 
of jews to death camps 
neal sher head of the us office of special investigation that 
looks into nazi war crimes said tuesday the notion that 
waldheim has been exonerated is absurd 
waldheim always denied war crimes accusations and after the 
british report was delivered in vienna his office stated the 
investigation report of the british government relayed to the 
british parliament today proves once again that the allegations 
against federal president dr kurt waldheim in connection with his 
wartime service are devoid of any foundation in this case too as 
has been the case with previous accusations 
in an interview later on austrian television waldheim said 
the report fills me of course with great satisfaction 
six british commandos were captured in april 1944 two years 
after nazi dictator adolf hitler ordered that all captured 
commandos be killed after interrogation 
the commandos of the special boat squadron were taken to 
arsakli 10 miles east of salonika for interrogation at the 
headquarters of german army group e where waldheim was a junior 
intelligence officer 
the prisoners refused to talk and were later shot by firing 
squad in a suburb of athens a war crime under the geneva 
convention which forbids killing prisoners of war 
no evidence has come to light to indicate that as a junior 
staff officer he waldheim had the power either to order or to 
prevent that fate or indeed to affect the outcome in any way 
hamilton said 
the report dismisses allegations that records were altered 
destroyed or withheld to protect waldheim and says waldheim was 
never wanted by britain either as a top nazi or as a war 
criminal 
robert rhodes james a british lawmaker who served in waldheims 
un office when waldheim was secretarygeneral and who pressed for 
the inquiry commented the conclusion is that because he was so 
junior he could not be accused of being a war criminal 
but the allegation was that waldheim was involved in war crimes 
and evidence of participation existed james said 
sher said it is absolutely impossible to conclude that 
waldheim was uninvolved in the interrogation of the commandos and 
the process which led to their demise 
greville janner secretary of the parliamentary war crimes 
group said in london waldheim was there he knew thats what 
the report says he should never have been secretarygeneral of the 
united nations nor president of austria 
we never suggested he was holding the smoking gun but the 
report confirms that he knew what was going on he was part of the 
team he knew our boys were being sent away to be exterminated and 
that is what the report confirms 
the new yorkbased world jewish congress said in a statement the 
report finally put to rest waldheims claim that no british 
commandos were interrogated at his headquarters 
the congress charged in 1986 that for more than 40 years 
waldheim covered up his past as an officer in the german army 
command that deported thousands of greek jews to their deaths and 
murdered yugoslav partisans and peasants

president bush in a rallying cry to gop 
governors said tuesday night that the key to wresting control of 
congress from the democrats in the 1990s is to elect more 
republican governors next year 
bush in remarks prepared for delivery at a republican governors 
association dinner said that if the party is to escape its 
minority status we must rededicate ourselves to the nuts and 
bolts of politics the grassroots as our opponents do 
he bemoaned the fact that 34 years have passed since the 
republicans last controlled the house of representatives and said 
the democrats perpetuate their hold through gerrymandering schemes 
approved by state legislatures they also control 
we have proven time and again that our party can keep the 
white house said bush but to win a majority of governorships 
state offices and seats in congress we must roll up our sleeves 
and get down to the basics of winning elections 
bush outlined what he called three obtainable goals for the 
1990 elections 
the first is to move toward our rightful place as the majority 
party of governors said bush the democrats now hold 28 
governorships to the republicans 22 
our second goal is to recapture the us senate he said 
the republicans held the senate from 1981 to 1987 but democrats 
now have the edge 5545 
and third we must open the house of representatives to 
twoparty competition the president said but the key to all 
three goals is the first to elect more republican governors 
he called gerrymandering drawing congressional district lines 
in ways to boost the chances of a particular party a terrible 
injustice 
as republican leaders you can veto these gerrymander schemes 
and take our message to voters of your states by declaring that 
this form of voter discrimination must end said bush the first 
president in the last four to reach the white house without first 
serving as a governor 
virginia and new jersey choose new governors next month 
thirtysix governorships are at stake in 1990 including 20 now 
held by democrats virginia now has a democratic governor new 
jersey a republican

the head of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency confirmed tuesday that the united states wants 
to reserve the right to continue producing chemical weapons even 
as it pursues an international pact on banning the deadly weapons 
ronald lehman was asked in a meeting with reporters about recent 
reports that president bush has signed an order allowing the 
continued production of a new generation of chemical weapons for an 
unspecified period of time 
the reports surfaced after bush told the united nations last 
month that he was proposing the united states and the soviet union 
cut their existing chemical weapons stockpiles by 80 percent as an 
impetus to the geneva negotiations at which talks on curbing 
chemical weapons are underway 
the president did not mention his decision on production in his 
un speech 
bush as vice president in 1984 carried a draft text to the 
geneva negotiations proposing that nations signing a chemical 
weapons treaty cease producing such arms right away and destroy 
their stockpiles over a 10year period the international talks in 
which 40 nations are taking part resume next month 
an agreedupon draft of the international treaty calls for the 
immediate end to the production of such weapons 
sen george mitchell dmaine on monday criticized bushs 
stance on continuing to produce chemical weapons calling it a 
major step backwards and one that threatens the international 
negotiations 
asked about such criticism lehman said the threat of chemical 
weapons needs to be addressed and our policy has been to seek a 
total ban on the production and storage and use of these weapons 
but he stressed that the administration has also been quite 
clear and told congress that it intends to maintain our binary 
program binary chemical weapons are a new generation of chemical 
arms that consist of two nonlethal substances that become deadly 
when mixed 
it is not good to cut programs in anticipation of negotiations 
that undercuts your negotiation leverage it undercuts your 
security lehman said 
the arms agency head said that the key to us elimination of 
its older chemical weapons is to get other nations to eliminate 
theirs and until they are committed to such a thing we will 
have a stock albeit a very small stock 
so we will be continuing our production program the president 
has asked us to look at how we would structure the program how we 
would implement this in the context of the overall negotiations 
lehman said 
our policy is clear whatever stocks will be maintained they 
should be the safest possible he said 
lehman defended the administrations stance saying it had made 
progress on the issue during the recent ussoviet talks in 
wyoming and said that as a result of that session the two 
superpowers will begin exchanging data on the location and types of 
stocks and amounts that the two sides have before the end of this 
year 
but soviets diplomats speaking privately have said the kremlin 
is concerned about bushs decision to continue production of the 
new generation of chemical weapons 
his un proposal on having the two superpowers reduce their 
stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20 percent of the current us 
level would mean deeper cuts for the soviets than for the united 
states 
us officials contend moscow has far greater stockpiles than 
the united states an acknowledged 50000 tons compared to an 
estimated 30000 tons for the united states 
bush proposed a ussoviet agreement to begin those cuts at 
once while the 40nation treaty was being worked out in which the 
united states would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over 
eight years if the soviets joined the ban 
the remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if 
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban 
only the united states the soviet union and iraq acknowledge 
having chemical weapons but more than 20 nations are believed to 
have them or the capability to produce them 
the united states has condemned iran and iraq for using chemical 
weapons and has said libya is on the verge of production some 
officials suspect syria has a chemical weapons program

who tried to save the five young children and two adults who died 
in the blaze

lost her father son and five grandchildren 
its a very great great great tragedy mrs scott said 
you dont know how i feel about losing my father and my baby boy 
and five little babies that couldnt even help themselves 
firefighters pulled three children from the burning threestory 
row house but they were dead when taken to the childrens hospital 
of philadelphia hospital spokeswoman brenda hicks said 
fire commissioner roger ulshafer said the fire appeared to be 
accidental but the cause was not immediately known 
ulshafer said the fire must have been burning for some time 
before it was reported at 734 am because the first floor was 
fully aflame when firefighters arrived from a firehouse two blocks 
away 
if you look at the faces of the firemen around here theyre 
stunned that in a small house like this you lose seven people 
he said 
he said the house apparently had no smoke alarms which are not 
required in older private homes three of the dead were found near 
a window he said 
there was fire coming out of the windows and the babies just 
screaming and howling people were all screaming and howling 
said cynthia morrison who lives in the workingclass neighborhood 
on the citys west side 
ian baldwin who lives across the street said his mother called 
in an alarm after he saw mrs scott running 
i saw her running across the street screaming my house is on 
fire my house is on fire he said i told my mom to call the 
fire department 
baldwin said he and a few other neighbors tried to enter the 
burning house from the rear there was too much smoke he said 
several more attempts were made by firefighters and three 
undercover police officers to enter the house but they were driven 
back by the heavy smoke and flames said john devlin a battalion 
fire chief 
the victims were identified as mrs scotts father clyde 
staples 66 her son emerson lee 19 and her grandchildren 
joseph lee 7 3yearold twins jamal and jeffrey lee andrell 
mccoy 5 and shanta mccoy 3 
emerson lee was the uncle of the five children the grandchild 
who survived was andrell mccoys twin 
later in the day dozens of neighbors gathered around the gray 
stucco home as firefighters tossed blackened mattresses chairs 
rubble and papers through shattered windows 
firstfloor shutters had partially melted and were dangling away 
from the building plumes of soot stretched up all sides of the 
house and onto the adjoining house which was otherwise undamaged

the first airlift in east 
germanys refugee exodus flew in from warsaw late tuesday with 
the 125 refugees flashing smiles new passports and a teddy bear 
before heading off for the next stop of their journey to a new life 
the flight brought relief to only a small fraction of the latest 
refugee wave as more than 1700 other east germans fleeing their 
reformresistant homeland remained behind in the polish capital 
awaiting travel documents 
in a compromise solution announced saturday the refugees were 
allowed to renounce their citizenship at the east german embassy in 
warsaw freeing them to go on to the west german embassy to receive 
the necessary travel documents 
now for the first time we can look forward to freedom 
declared 27yearold gabriele holger after descending with her son 
and husband from the sovietmade tupolev154 aircraft 
the bonn government chartered the aircraft from polands lot 
airline 
twelveyearold michaela ostmann clutched her teddy bear sonny 
heart as her parents and fellow passengers were hustled onto 
buses waiting on the tarmac for the refugees who touched down in 
this northern industrial city just after 830 pm 
the refugees the latest of more than 53000 to arrive in west 
germany since last month were the first to fly to freedom east 
germany agreed to the arrangement apparently to avoid the 
nearriots that marred two previous evacuations from warsaw and 
prague czechoslovakia 
during a dramatic release of thousands on oct 5 east german 
police used force to prevent other desperate wouldbe escapees from 
jumping aboard the westbound trains as they passed through east 
germany 
a couple of dozen relatives friends and wellwishers were left 
stranded inside duesseldorf airport terminal when authorities 
prevented them from going onto the tarmac the new arrivals were 
being quickly directed onto buses for the trip to a reception 
center at schoeppingen about 40 minutes to the north 
we are a little disappointed said anika roescher of 
duesseldorf one of those unable to greet the arrivals we wanted 
to see if our friends were in this group 
a distraught woman at the airport information office shouted 
over the public address system to the thwarted greetingparty we 
have no possibility to let you get in contact with the arriving 
refugees we understand very well that you are angry frustrated 
and disappointed at not being able to talk to them the voice 
said 
during arrivals of east germans from hungary czechoslovakia and 
poland in recent weeks the public was generally allowed to greet 
the newcomers authorities at duesseldorf airport explained 
however they wanted to get the new arrivals to schoeppingen 
quickly 
one angry young west german who declined to give his name told 
reporters he was waiting for his uncle and now ill have to 
return home without knowing if he has arrived 
in the polish capital refugee children at the airport held up a 
banner before their departure reading thank you warsaw auf 
wiedersehen 
things cant go wrong now we just hope we make it safely and 
dont crash said a young construction worker from east berlin as 
he stood in line with other refugees there to check in for the 
flight 
the plane took off on schedule for the twohour journey 
west german ambassador franzjoachim schoeller boarded the plane 
in warsaw shortly before takeoff to bid farewell to the refugees 
and he said the number of east germans remaining there has swelled 
to 1667 
east germans have been arriving at the embassy for weeks 
tens of thousands of east germans have fled east germany 
recently most of them skilled young workers who complain of 
repression by erich honeckers strict regime 
hans klein chief west german spokesman said in bonn his 
government had asked the east germans to process papers for the 
refugees in warsaw in groups larger than the 4050 originally 
planned he said the east germans had not responded 
the flood of german refugees began after hungary removed all 
restrictions on its border with austria on sept 10 an additional 
70000 emigrated by legal means or did not return from visits to 
west germany 
honeckers government requires the refugees in warsaw to give up 
their citizenship in exchange for new identity cards which allow 
them to leave for the west choice but prohibit them from traveling 
through east germany

here is the text of president bushs letter to 
sen robert c byrd dwva outlining his opposition to a bill 
that would extend medicaid benefits to pay for abortions for 
victims of rape or incest byrd is chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee which has jurisdiction over the bill 
dear bob 
as the senate begins consideration of hr 2990 the conference 
report accompanying the department of labor health and human 
services and education and related appropriations bill for 
fiscal year 1990 i want you to know that i will not sign the 
measure should it include language that expands federal funding for 
abortion beyond that which has been current law sine 1981 
my position on the issue of abortion is clear i support a 
constitutional amendment that would reverse the supreme courts 
decision in roe v wade i also support a human life amendment with 
an exception for rape incest or where the life of the mother is 
threatened i do not support federal funding of abortions except 
where the mothers life is threatened 
as hr 2990 progressed through the legislative process my 
senior advisors indicated that they would recommend i veto the 
measure if it included expanded federal funding for abortion beyond 
the life of the mother exception although i wrote a letter to 
members of congress clearly expressing my concerns during 
consideration of the district of columbia appropriations bill for 
fy 1990 i nonetheless asked my senior advisors to take another 
look at this complex issue particularly the role of public funds 
consistent though with my position as stated above 
this decision is one that i have not reached easily or lightly 
many citizens and members of congress were consulted as this 
question was reviewed abortion is a difficult often painful and 
very personal decision for all americans it is made even more 
difficult when the underlying issue is whether the government and 
ultimately the american taxpayer is asked to pay for abortions 
and under what circumstances since 1981 the federal government 
has detemined i think wisely that taxpayer funds should be used 
for abortion in only the most narrow of circumstances where the 
life of the mother is endangered if abortion funding were expanded 
to include other circumstances it would be difficult to limit to 
the few cases of actual rape or incest and could have the 
unintended consequence of allowing the taking of countless other 
lives of unborn children well beyond the few cases argued as 
reasons for the proposed legislative change 
my intense personal concern for those women who are victims of 
the crimes of rape and incest is as strongly felt as my position on 
abortion rape and incest are crimes of violence which must not go 
unpunished and those convicted of such crimes must be brought to 
justice 
the question raised by hr 2990 however involves whether the 
federal government and american taxpayers should be forced to pay 
for the termination of an unborn childs life in the case of rape 
or incest that such a child may have been conceived through an 
unconscionable act of violence makes this question difficult and 
indeed agonizing it does not however alter the basic fact that 
federal funding is being sought that would compound a violent act 
with the taking of an unborn life and in the absence of perfect 
legislation that would reconcile these difficult issues if i have 
to err i prefer to err on the side of human life 
for these reasons should hr 2990 reach my desk with language 
expanding federal funding of abortion i will veto the measure and 
return it to congress

prime minister yitzhak shamir said tuesday that 
israel stood ready to confront the united states rather than trade 
occupied land for peace 
we are not interested in conflicts shamir said in some of 
his harshest words for the bush administration but the united 
states should know that there are things israel will stand on to 
the end 
shamir told supporters of his rightwing likud bloc at a rally 
in ramle in everything related to the land of israel we shall 
stand as one man and we will not give in even if we would have to 
face a conflict i hope we would not have to it is not justified 
from the american point of view but totally justified from the 
jewish and the israeli points of view 
shamir rejected american efforts to arrange negotiations between 
israeli and palestinian delegations in cairo president hosni 
mubarak of egypt has offered to play host to such talks 
the stonethrowers the firebombers have not succeeded in 
driving us into the arms of the plo it is not possible that when 
they fail to do this others by diplomatic means and exercises 
would try to bring us to meetings with the plo shamir said 
he said the proposed meeting would be a trap in which other 
parties would try to make israel slide into recognition of a 
palestinian state 
israel has balked at the proposed meeting with palestinian 
representatives because it fears the palestinians would be members 
of the palestine liberation organization israel considers the plo 
a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it 
shamir told a closeddoor meeting of likud legislators earlier 
tuesday that israel might be entering a period of tension with 
the united states israel radio reported 
on tuesday a human rights group reported that israeli soldiers 
killed 20 palestinians in the first two weeks of october one of 
the bloodiest periods of the 22monthold uprising against israeli 
rule in the occupied lands 
the increase in deaths followed a change in army orders last 
month that allows soldiers to fire live ammunition at masked 
palestinians who ignore orders to halt even if they are not armed 
army reports said at least eight palestinians killed in the 
first 15 days of october wore masks 
according to the israeli information center for human rights 
the early october death toll was second only to the same period in 
april 1988 when 23 palestinians were killed 
soldiers or israeli civilians have killed 596 palestinians since 
the uprising began dec 8 1987 in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip and 40 israelis have died at least 130 palestinians have 
been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating 
with israel 
defense minister yitzhak rabin toured three west bank towns 
tuesday including beit sahour where soldiers and tax agents have 
carried out tax raids for three weeks 
reporters and photographers were not allowed to accompany rabin 
into the christian town which the army has declared a closed 
military zone 
telephone lines also have been cut to beit sahour a town of 
about 10000 known for widespread compliance with a tax boycott 
called by the uprising leadership 
israeli officials said up to 1 million worth of furniture 
machinery and other goods had been confiscated in beit sahour and 
would be sold to recover unpaid taxes the town is prosperous 
because scores of small familyowned factories operate there 
everyone everywhere pays taxes rabin said after touring 
beit sahour 
in nearby bethlehem a soldier pursuing palestinian 
stonethrowers was slightly injured by a rock and troopers opened 
fire wounding one palestinian the army said a second man was 
reported arrested 
elsewhere seven other palestinians were shot and wounded in 
clashes with israeli troops arab hospital officials reported the 
army said it was checking the reports

investigators inadvertently touched rumors at 
the outset of the mcmartin preschool molestation case creating 
community hysteria that tainted the probe a defense attorney said 
tuesday in the 2yearlong trial 
attorney dean gits outlined a range of doubts about police 
competence and witnesses credibility appealing to a jury during 
his closing statement to depend on common sense and the legal 
standard of reasonable doubt 
i want you to take them and put them in your pocket and carry 
them with you gits said 
raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 
are charged with 64 counts of molestation and a joint count of 
conspiracy they are accused of molesting 11 children at the 
familyowned mcmartin preschool in suburban manhattan beach 
the alleged crimes date back a decade and the trial at 2 
years is the longest criminal proceeding in the nation judge 
william pounders has said jury deliberations in superior court 
could be very lengthy 
gits argued that police incompetence at the start of an 
investigation of a parents complaint touched off rumors in 
manhattan beach 
he cited a sept 8 1983 form letter that investigators sent to 
hundreds of parents whose children had attended the preschool 
the letter asked parents to keep the investigation confidential 
because of the highly emotional effect it could have on our 
community 
law enforcement completely lost control of the interview 
process it was the start of rumors that governed this case gits 
said 
he said medical procedures used to determine whether children 
were molested were unscientific and that too many people testified 
they never saw sexual abuse for the allegations to make sense 
gits focused on conflicting information in the testimony of one 
alleged victim a boy who said games like naked movie star 
tickle and cowboys and indians took place in a secret room 
the boy attended the school from fall 1978 to june 1979 
he testified at a preliminary hearing that teacher babette 
spitler was in a room at the time of a naked movie star game 
and molested him gits said he said the boy didnt claim that 
during the trial and that ms spitler didnt work at the school 
when he was there 
ms spitler was among seven mcmartin teachers originally 
arrested in 1983 charges against her and four others were dropped 
for lack of evidence and the case was scaled down from hundreds of 
counts involving 41 children 
the judge has limited each side to 6 days for closing 
arguments fearing a mistrial if the case drags on 
deputy district attorney roger gunson concluded his summation on 
monday after three days reserving 3 days for rebuttal of defense 
arguments

georgia asked a federal appeals court tuesday to 
allow implementation of a law opposed by abortion rights advocates 
that would require young women to inform their parents before 
having abortions 
an attorney representing two planned parenthood chapters in 
georgia urged the 11th us circuit court of appeals to uphold 
lower court decisions which have blocked the law for two years 
the law would require a woman under 18 to bring a note from a 
parent before having an abortion or otherwise show a parent was 
notified a minor could secure the permission of a juvenile court 
judge to undergo an abortion without parental knowledge 
the statute also includes a 24hour waiting period between the 
time of notification and the abortion 
the appeals court took the case under consideration without 
indicating when it would rule 
the statute was first passed in 1987 but a lawsuit filed by 
planned parenthood resulted in a federal judge ruling key portions 
unconstitutional before it took effect the legislature revised the 
statute in 1988 but it was again challenged by planned parenthood 
with the same result 
in the second lowercourt ruling us district judge robert 
hall ruled among other things that the law improperly allowed a 
juvenile court intake officer to screen and possibly dismiss a 
young womans request for a waiver 
kathryn allen a senior assistant state attorney general 
complained to the the appeals court tuesday that hall applied too 
strict a standard 
the court below has taken what is constitutionally permissible 
and put it under a microscope finding constitutional defects in 
the most unlikely places ms allen said 
dara klassel a planned parenthood lawyer disagreed 
laws affecting a fundamental constitutional right have to be 
subjected to strict scrutiny she said

an afghan convoy is en route to the 
eastern border town of khost where planes have been parachuting 
supplies to communist troops besieged by usbacked rebels 
western diplomats said tuesday 
they said that elsewhere rebels have blockaded the 75mile 
highway linking kabul the capital to the eastern city of 
jalalabad and that the government has launched heavy air attacks 
and armored assaults trying to open the road 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said guerrilla 
forces have moved within three miles of khost airport the town 
lies about 10 miles from the border with pakistan guerrilla groups 
long have used pakistan as a base 
the rebels have been trying for weeks to take the heavily 
fortified town the capture of khost would allow them to open 
direct supply lines to bases in central and northern afghanistan 
diplomatic sources presumably with access to satellite 
pictures said photographs show parachutes inside the khost 
perimeter there is clear visible evidence of air drops by 
government forces one diplomat said 
rebel sources said planes parachuted 44 barrels of fuel about 
two weeks ago but eight reached the target and the rest landed in 
guerrillacontrolled areas 
the last attempt to resupply khost by land was in december 1987 
when 20000 soviet soldiers reportedly helped out the attempt 
succeeded after six weeks 
diplomats said a 200vehicle convoy left kabul late last week 
and was moving slowly toward gardez about 45 miles northwest of 
khost 
moscow sent more than 103000 soldiers into afghanistan in 1979 
to back up the marxist government but the last soviet soldiers 
left last feb 15 in keeping with a unbrokered accord 
however the soviet union has airlifted millions of dollars in 
military aid to the government in kabul since then diplomatic 
sources say 
washington is a major backer of the afghan rebels who have been 
fighting for more than a decade to oust successive communist 
governments

east germanys ruling politburo held a meeting 
tuesday that could determine the fate of erich honecker the 
77yearold leader whose stern rule has been challenged by mass 
emigration and prodemocracy protest 
demonstrations were reported in five cities on the eve of the 
regular weekly meeting including a march by 120000 people in 
leipzig that was the largest protest since east germany was founded 
40 years ago 
in west germany the masscirculation newspaper bild reported 
late tuesday that a special session of the communist party central 
committee had been called for wednesday 
quoting party sources it did not identify bild said honecker 
would be pressured to turn over leadership of the party to 
younger hands honecker also is east germanys head of state 
secrecy surrounded the politburo meeting early wednesday there 
was no report of any action taken at the session 
the flight of tens of thousands of east germans and protests 
that began early this month have been the most visible signs of 
growing opposition to honecker who has presided over an 
authoritarian regime for 18 years 
prodemocracy activists estimated the monday night throng in 
leipzig at more than 120000 but west germanys zdf television 
network quoted witnesses tuesday as saying the number of marchers 
was closer to 150000 
chants of freedom and democracy now rose from the 
throng and marchers shouted were staying here most protesters 
in east germany have been people who do not want to emigrate and 
demand reform at home akin to those being pursued in the soviet 
union hungary and poland 
ard television of west germany said thousands also marched 
monday night in magdeburg plauen and halle 
about 3000 prodemocracy activists held a vigil in an east 
berlin church monday night security on the capitals streets was 
increased but no incidents were reported 
three men were given prison terms for vandalism illegal 
assembly and resisting arrest oct 45 when thousands of people 
tried to board trains at dresden that carried east german refugees 
to west germany from czechoslovakia and poland 
two got more than three years and the third received 4 years 
said the official news agency adn which reported the convictions 
and sentences tuesday 
mayor wolfgang berghofer of dresden told 10000 protesters from 
a city hall balcony monday night speaking through a megaphone 
that he was prepared to continue dialogue with reformminded groups 
he refused however to talk with the prodemocracy new forum a 
new organization that has united the east german reform movement 
at last weeks regular meeting the 21member politburo 
expressed willingness to talk about possible reform 
that increased interest in this tuesdays session which many 
people felt might indicate the political futures of honecker and 
his aging colleagues 
power rests in the hands of the politburo which is dominated by 
hardliners but leadership changes need formal approval by the 
central committee which has 163 members 
there have been reports and speculation for days that honecker 
who rejected talks with prodemocracy groups might be near the end 
of his tenure bild reported monday that regional party leaders 
were demanding his dismissal 
the no 2 official in east germanys higher education ministry 
was quoted by bild as saying in life anything is possible when 
asked about a honecker resignation 
the official joachim garscha also told bild that government 
officials realize east germanys strict regulation of travel to the 
west is among the chief complaints of many citizens garscha said 
freer travel regulations could come very soon 
bilds interview with garscha was to appear in wednesday 
editions but it was telexed to other news media in advance 
official media have carried scores of letters and commentaries 
critical of the regime 
in recent days thousands of prominent east german artists 
intellectuals and entertainers have spoken out for change 
reform groups also have urged the government to declare a 
general amnesty for those arrested and convicted of crimes in 
connection with street protests which police had broken up with 
clubs until last week 
east germanys chief prosecutor in an interview with state 
television tuesday promised to investigate charges of police 
brutality against protesters 
prosecutor guenter wendlandt said complaints by citizens will 
be investigated and decisions will be made according to the 
corresponding laws 
the communist party newspaper neues deutschland said tuesday 
everything should be discussed openly but it added that 
changing the systems structure would not be discussed

a major earthquake rocked northern 
california tuesday evening collapsing part of the san francisco 
bay bridge and shaking candlestick park and buildings up to 95 
miles away 
some buildings may have collapsed said police officer d 
collins there were reports of injuries at candlestick where fans 
were waiting for the world series to begin and the stadium was 
evacuated abctv and cable news network reported 
the quake which lasted about 15 seconds measured 65 on the 
richter scale according to seismologists at the california 
institute of technology in pasadena the preliminary reading was 
from the alaska tsunami warning system caltech said 
televised footage of the bridge showed that a 30foot section of 
the spans upper deck had collapsed onto the bottom level 
fans at candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed for about 15 
seconds players from the san francisco giants and the oakland 
athletics were on the field and stood around as fans began to leave 
their seats 
buildings in san francisco swayed several feet 
the quake shook buildings in sacramento 95 miles to the 
northeast and was felt as far away as reno nev 225 miles to the 
east 
the quake knocked out phones and power including electricity at 
the associated press bureau in san francisco 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

britain paved the way tuesday for the probable 
release of at least three people imprisoned 14 years ago for ira 
bombings aimed at british soldiers the irish government and civil 
libertarians cheered the move 
the government said it will not oppose the appeal by the 
socalled guildford four three men and a woman who insisted 
throughout that they were innocent and who became the focus of a 
lengthy campaign for their release 
the times of london newspaper said policemen involved in the 
original investigation that led to the convictions and life terms 
will be prosecuted 
in its wednesday issue copies of which were available tuesday 
night the paper reported a handful of officers who were then 
of relatively junior rank will face charges after an investigation 
by police into a number of aspects of the original inquiry 
a spokesman at the home office the government department 
responsible for police refused to comment 
the bombings led to murder convictions for the guildford four 
during a wave of terrorism by the irish republican army 
the dublin government leaders of the roman catholic and 
anglican churches and prominent british government figures 
protested the innocence of the four 
british broadcasting corp television the domestic news agency 
press association and other news reports said at least three of the 
prisoners probably would be released soon after a court of appeal 
hearing thursday 
circumstances have recently come to the notice of the director 
of public prosecutions which have caused him to conclude that it 
would be wrong for the crown to seek to sustain the convictions 
the prosecutors office said 
it said its decision will be explained at the thursday hearing 
the murder convictions of paul hill gerard conlon and patrick 
armstrong all of belfast northern ireland and of armstrongs 
english girlfriend carole richardson were referred to the court 
of appeal by home secretary douglas hurd in january 
the four were convicted of murder in the bombing of two pubs 
frequented by british soldiers in guildford southwest of london 
on oct 5 1974 five people were killed including two soldiers 
and 65 injured 
armstrong and hill also were convicted of a nov 6 1974 pub 
bombing in woolwich a london suburb in which two people died and 
26 people were injured hill is serving a concurrent sentence for 
the murder of a former british soldier in belfast in 1975 and so 
may not be released with the others news reports said that 
conviction was based on statements obtained by belfast police while 
he was in prison in guildford 
ira guerrillas are fighting to drive the british from northern 
ireland and unite the british province with the republic of ireland 
in ordering the case reviewed hurd cited possible alibi 
witnesses for two of the convicts and evidence that ms richardson 
had been injected with drugs during interrogation because she was 
suffering from withdrawal from barbiturates 
all four were convicted on the basis of incriminating statements 
which they repudiated when they came to trial the prosecution did 
not offer any forensic evidence or identifications by witnesses to 
the bombings 
four members of an ira unit the balcombe street four 
admitted the two guildford pub bombings after their arrest in 
december 1975 but they were never charged in the case 
the ira mens statements about the bombing were presented to the 
court of appeal in 1977 but the government attorney argued those 
statements did not necessarily preclude the participation of the 
four convicted earlier 
in dublin the irish government welcomed the decision in the 
most positive terms 
the government shares what it knows will be a general feeling 
today of great relief and satisfaction at this outcome the irish 
statement said 
cardinal basil hume head of the roman catholic church in 
britain told bbctv he was immensely grateful for the decision 
i absolutely cant believe it hills mother lilly hill 
told bbc radio from belfast good god i just cant believe that 
this has happened 
lord scarman who was active in the campaign said the decision 
represented more than a pardon these people will now be 
innocent 
i think the british legal system will benefit in reputation 
sid scarman 78 who as a law lord formerly was part of britains

the killing of an army colonels 
daughter could jeopardize talks between salvadoran guerrillas and 
the government over ways to end their countrys 10yearold civil 
war a government spokesman said tuesday 
it is a disastrous terrorist plan to assassinate public 
officials and their families said mauricio sandoval a spokesman 
for the government delegation following the shooting in san 
salvador on tuesday 
men firing automatic weapons killed ana isabel casanova a 
student who was celebrating her 23rd birthday in her car a block 
from her home 
in san salvador the government blamed insurgents for the 
attack but the language in the claim of responsibility was unlike 
that used by the rebels in the past 
a man purporting to speak for the joint command of urban 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front called 
at least one radio station in el salvador to claim responsibility 
for the attack 
the caller said the attack was meant to underline demands for 
the release of a missing unionist allegedly arrested by security 
forces and to call for an end to repression by government security 
forces 
however rebel leaders in el salvador said in statement it is 
totally false that urban commandos from the fmln killed miss isabel 
casanova and we reiterate it is not fmln policy to attempt against 
the lives of relatives of military chiefs 
the rebel leaders said the slaying was part of psychological 
warfare that the salvadoran military high commands intelligence 
division and the press office is waging against them 
it is highly suspicious that this occurs just when this 
meeting is taking place and the intention to speedily blame the 
fmln for the attack the rebel leaders said in the statement 
which was also handed out in san jose 
anyone can pick up the telephone and say hes from the fmln 
rebel spokeswoman nidia diaz told reporters as she distributed the 
statement 
there has been little progress reported in the two days of talks 
between the rebels and the rightist government of president alfredo 
cristiani the government has proposed a ceasefire without the 
economic political and legal reforms the farabundo marti national 
liberation front guerrillas insist on 
gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary bishop of san salvador and a 
witness at the talks said the negotiating process allows hope 
not for spectacular results but for them at the end to reach a 
minimal agreement that allows work to continue so that a peace 
agreement finally is signed 
rebels said the assassination of the colonels daughter like 
the removal of rebel sympathizers during a peace vigil at the 
metropolitan cathedral in san salvador would not interrupt the 
talks 
the costa rica talks are the second meeting between the 
government and rebels since the opening session occurred in mexico 
city in september 
a previous round of dialogue between the government and rebels 
in october 1987 was broken off because of the assassination of 
herbert anaya leader of a leftist human rights group 
the front said tuesday it proposed purging the armed forces of 
its top officers including defense minister gen humberto larios 
gen juan rafael bustillo the air force chief and col rene 
ponce chief of the joint chiefs of staff 
the majority of those officers have accumulated large economic 
interests through corruption the rebel proposal says they are 
involved or directly linked to acts of repression and crime 
rosa chavez who with archbishop arturo rivera damas has 
mediated contact between the guerrillas and government for several 
years said the two sides were trying tuesday to agree on what 
constitutes a ceasefire in the war which has killed an estimated 
70000 people most of them civilians

it was not immediately clear how extensive the damage was from 
the quake which struck at 504 pm pdt and registered 69 on the 
richter scale it was centered near hollister 80 miles southeast 
of san francisco in san benito county 
the thing struck just as everyone was going home said tom 
mullins a spokesman for the california office of emergency 
services in sacramento weve got reports coming in from san 
benito and santa clara counties of heavy damage 
cbs said the california highway patrol reported a jc penney 
building in downtown hollister collapsed and a bridge on highway 
101 in hollister collapsed 
there were unconfirmed reports that a shopping mall collapsed in 
san jose 50 miles south of san francisco 
san francisco airport was evacuated and some people there were 
hit with falling plaster 
one major fire was blazing in san franciscos marina district 
and another near the library at university of california at 
berkeley a huge plume of smoke visible for miles over berkeley 
hundreds of people fled bay area rapid transit subway and 
elevated stations in san francisco and east bay suburbs the system 
was shut down 
televised footage of the bridge connecting oakland and san 
francisco showed that a 30foot section of the upper deck had 
collapsed leaving two cars dangling between the two levels 
reports said most occupants got out of their cars safely 
in washington president bush said the federal government was 
prepared to send help to the earthquake area in california and he 
was sending transportation secretary samuel skinner there to assess 
the damage 
at city hall in san francisco a radio reporter told listeners 
the entire building started to shake you could hear people 
yelling and screaming all over the building 
she said there were obvious problems at the health 
department across the street water was literally gushing out of 
the building from a window on the second floor the unidentified 
reporter said 
citizens of marin north of san francisco were warned to shut 
off their gas because the smell of gas was all over town 
frank baldwin of us geological surveys earthquake center said 
the quakes magnitude was 69 on the richter scale it occurred at 
504 pm pdt and was centered in the santa cruz calif area 75 
miles south of san francico on the pacific coast 
the quake was felt as far away as reno nev 225 miles to the 
northeast 
the quake knocked out phones and power including electricity at 
the associated press bureau in san francisco 
the san mateo bridge which crosses the bay about 10 miles south 
of candlestick park was closed for inspection 
san francisco police officer dwayne collins said there were 
reports that buildings and statues in the historic south of market 
district near downtown had collapsed 
i thought i was losing my balance then i saw the lamppost 
sway one foot each direction then i saw falling glass broken 
glass on the street but luckily not near me said les galvacs 
who was walking down market street in downtown san francisco 
david balague 22 was on the 14th floor of the bank of america 
building ive never been so scared people were fighting to get 
under the desks 
fans at candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed shortly 
before the san francisco giants and oakland athletics were to have 
begun the third game of the world series 
this upper deck was absolutely shaking the light stanchions 
were blowing back and forth phones have gone out suzyn waldman 
a reporter covering the world series for wfanam in new york told 
listeners shortly after the quake hit everyone is standing 
around here people in the upper deck absolutely terrified to move 
not knowing what to do 
a man in saratoga southwest of san jose told a san francisco 
radio station my house is ok but everything in it is gone my 
refrigerator is standing in the middle of the kitchen he said 
10000 gallons of water from his swimming pool crashed through his 
picture window into his home 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase

anatoly karpov of the soviet union and jan timman 
of the netherlands scored decisive lastround victories tuesday 
against their opponents in the world chess championship candidates 
semifinal 
they will face off in the candidates final set for march in 
london with the winner challenging world champion garri kasparov 
of the soviet union for his title in a 24game match starting 
october 1990 
karpov and timman each won by 45 points to 35 a win scores 
one point and a draw half a point 
karpov 38 who held the world title for 10 years until losing 
to kasparov in 1985 scored a crushing semifinal lastround victory 
over fellow soviet artur yusupov in 53 moves 
timman 37 defeated jon speelman of england in 54 moves after a 
zigzag battle 
after leaving the stage at the sadlers wells ballet theater 
karpov told a news conference the quality of play in his match 
against yusupov and in timmans match against speelman was poor 
asked to comment on kasparovs claim that the world champion 
wouldnt face a difficult challenge in 1990 karpov replied if 
we play on the same level as here he has no rival but i dont 
think we shall play this level of chess all the time 
timman told a later news conference he felt psychologically 
stronger after the match 
asked about his chances of beating karpov timman said i 
never say before the match what i think my chances are 
karpov and timman will each receive 77000 for their play in 
the semifinal yusupov and speelman will each receive 46200 
a german computer company has offered a prize of 1 million swiss 
francs 616000 to the first westerner to win the candidates 
final and challenge kasparov 
playing with the advantage of white karpov returned to form 
after a lackluster showing in the first seven games 
kasparov said by telephone from los angeles that karpov deserved 
to lose his match against yusupov 
he cited a winning continuation missed by yusupov in the sixth 
game which could have catapulted yusupov into the lead 
on tuesday an inferior continuation from yusupov on the 17th 
move let in karpovs pieces to swarm around yusupovs king 
on the 24th move karpov sacrificed a knight to rip open the 
pawn cover around yusupovs king 
yusupov eventually emerged two pawns behind in a hopeless 
endgame 
playing white in an english opening speelman gained an 
initiative after an early exchange of queens and could have won a 
pawn on the 19th move experts said 
but playing for bigger stakes speelman steered the game into 
complications 
with timman having only 10 minutes for his last 13 moves 
speelman made a weak 28th move that let timman gain a pawn on the 
31st move 
timman won a second pawn following a weak 45th move from 
speelman 
nine moves later speelman resigned

rain offshore not demonstrators or 
mechanical problems stopped the launch of the space shuttle 
atlantis and its nuclearfueled cargo tuesday 
it looks like the local weather is not going to cooperate 
were going to call it a day launch director bob sieck told the 
five astronauts who had been lying on their backs in atlantis 
cabin for three hours 
nasa said it will try again wednesday at 1250 pm edt 
but tuesday nights earthquake in northern california gave the 
national aeronautics and space administration some concern the 
rocket which propels the galileo space probe is controlled in 
flight by an air force station in sunnyvale calif nasa said it 
had received reports the station suffered some damage 
the stations condition would have to be assessed before workers 
started filling the shuttles fuel tank early wednesday said steve 
nesbitt a spokesman at the johnson space center in houston 
the launch opportunity determined by the relative positions of 
earth and jupiter extends until 121 pm 
the outlook was not promising with only a 60 percent prospect 
for adequate weather wednesday another scrub then and no further 
attempt could be made until friday at the earliest the chances for 
clear skies friday were rated at 70 percent 
nasas last opportunity to launch the space probe is nov 21 
when earth and jupiter lose their favorable alignment the launch 
window lengthens each day until nov 2 then gets shorter by 
the day 
the scrub cost nasa 624000 more than half of that for the 
liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that had been pumped into the 
shuttles external fuel tank overnight 
atlantiss mission already delayed for seven years by budget 
and other problems is to carry the 6700pound galileo probe into 
orbit the start of its 24 billionmile sixyear trip to jupiter 
the 15 billion galileo is the most expensive and sophisticated 
unmanned spacecraft ever built and is expected to give scientists 
their best and closest look at another planet 
the weather became a factor in the final hours of tuesdays 
countdown with clouds building offshore and across the kennedy 
space center runway 
the showers were in an area that atlantis would have to pass 
through if an engine were lost shortly after liftoff and the 
astronauts had to attempt an emergency landing on the 15000foot 
runway near the launch pad 
officials also worry that rain hitting a descending shuttle 
could severely damage the fragile tiles that protect the vehicle 
from heat during reentry from orbit 
for a time it also appeared that all three emergency landing 
sites in spain and morocco were unusable because of weather 
another reason for abandoning the launch attempt but moments 
before the final scrub the runway at ben guerir in morocco was 
deemed ok 
protesters had tried to block the launch in court because 
galileos two electrical generators are fueled by highly 
radioactive plutonium they feared an accident during launch like 
the explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger would release 
the plutonium in the atmosphere 
but promised protests at the launch site did not materialize 
one man was arrested after declaring that he would walk through a 
restricted gate eight boats were shepherded out of the protected 
area offshore but the coast guard said none appeared to be trying 
to interfere with the launch 
there were also no intrusions into the restricted airspace 
around the launch site 
it was a quiet day not even a minor traffic accident said 
gary wistrand the space centers deputy security director the 
same precautions will prevail wednesday he said even though 
protest groups had given no indication that attempts would be made 
to interfere with the launch 
to guard against unwarranted intrusions about 200 armed 
security guards were deployed around the 144000acre space center 
the government and its contractors had another 200 people ready to 
monitor any release of plutonium 
the countdown went without a hitch to the nineminute mark and 
sieck held it there for several minutes to wait out the weather he 
then allowed the count to go down to the fiveminute mark hoping 
showers would move out 
nasa had only a 26minute period during which earth and jupiter 
were in proper alignment for a launch sieck had two minutes left 
when he scrubbed

authorities are trying to determine whether a 
12yearold girl was kidnapped in infancy or was given away by her 
mother who now wants her back from the woman who has raised her 
ever since 
cynthia anderson 31 the girls biological mother was in a 
grocery store friday when she heard the voice of maxine mccaslin 
43 who used to work for her as a baby sitter she had not seen 
mccaslin since 1977 when mccaslin and andersons 6monthold 
daughter both vanished 
anderson got mccaslins license number and notified police 
detective mona jaramillo said the women had lived just 17 blocks 
apart for the last two years 
the girl who did not know about her biological mother until 
friday was in a foster home until tuesday when denver juvenile 
court allowed her to return to mccaslin until the custody case can 
be resolved officials said 
mccaslin who reared the child from infancy told police 
anderson asked her to care for the child because anderson could not 
it was hell keeping the secret police quoted mccaslin as 
saying 
anderson claims now that her daughter was kidnapped 
however jaramillo said that in 1977 anderson filed a complaint 
against mccaslin over the custody of the child but not a 
kidnapping complaint 
our records indicated that the natural mother had turned this 
child over to the other woman it was not regarded as a kidnapping 
back then the detective said 
there was no immediate explanation where mccaslin and the girl 
had been until two years ago why police had never located them or 
whether anderson could have cared for the girl there also was no 
information immediately available about the girls father 
jaramillo said police were unable to comment on the womens 
whereabouts over the years because it is part of the investigation 
mccaslin had an unlisted telephone number and could not be 
reached for comment tuesday andersons lawyer dennis blewitt of 
boulder was out of his office and did not immediately return 
calls and police records are incomplete 
i just cant give up hope and thats all i can say 
anderson said in a statement monday she could not be located for 
additional comment tuesday no telephone number is listed for her 
shes very distraught blewitt said adding that anderson 
has bought birthday presents each year hoping someday to locate 
her daughter 
today the denver department of social services refused to let 
the mother see her daughter blewitt said i dont know why 
but they said we leaked this to the press we didnt but 
somebody did 
blewitt said he knew nothing about the father 
mccaslin told the girl of her history after both were taken to 
police headquarters friday night police said 
no charges had been filed 
the stories are so conflicting it was impossible to prove the 
case beyond a reasonable doubt said denver district attorney 
norm early 
we are not sure whether we will file criminal charges against 
mccaslin at this point said capt jim fitzpatrick the main 
person we and the courts are concerned about at this point is the 
victim 
its been hard on her she never knew there was another woman 
who claims to be her mother 
she has been well treated has been raised in an excellent 
environment and is a bright little girl said fitzpatrick 
detective sgt gordon reed also involved in the investigation 
said there are many mitigating factors on both sides 
the one real victim is the little girl her life as she knew 
it has been destroyed he said 
reed described it as probably the most tragic case ive seen 
in 21 years with the denver police department 
authorities say many reports from the case have vanished in the 
intervening years because of the complexity of the case police may 
have to rely on memories of other police officers who investigated 
the case 12 years ago police said 
neighbors and school officials said the girl is a welladjusted 
seventhgrader a bplus student and a volleyball player at a 
private school 
a neighbor who tutors the child in math described her as a 
wonderful little girl a very wellmannered kid

the major earthquake that struck the san 
francisco bay area tuesday occurred in a region seismologists 
targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in 
northern california 
a 1988 report by the us geological survey placed the 
probability of an earthquake of 65 magnitude on the richter scale 
at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the southern santa cruz mountains 
the high probability is based on several factors including 
length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 
1906 said clarence allen professor of geology and geophysics at 
the california institue of technology in pasadena 
this is not to say we predicted the earthquake it just has to 
do with the probability of an earthquake in this area allen said 
he noted that the 1988 report titled probabilities of large 
earthquakes occurring in california on the san andreas fault 
presented information that was already widely known among 
scientists allen said this information should have alerted 
officials to take preventive steps 
frank baldwin of us geological surveys earthquake center said 
the quakes magnitude was 69 on the richter scale it was centered 
in the santa cruz calif area 75 miles south of san francico 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs a reading of 6 can cause severe damage a quake of 7 
magnitude a major earthquake is capable of widespread heavy 
damage 
initial reports indicated widespread damage from tuesdays 
quake especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings 
its not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a 
calamitous event its something we should therefore be ready 
for allen said 
the damage in the bay area occurred to the same kind of 
structures heavily damaged in the 1987 whittier quake in the los 
angeles area which registered a 59 richter reading allen said 
i think well learn a lot from an engineering point of view 
from this earthquake he said what will be important is to see 
how the modern structures behaved 
allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that 
appeared to have been damaged in san francisco also exist in the 
los angeles region in addition some of the roadways and 
overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction 
as the bay bridge 
in some areas of southern california there is a higher 
probability of a major quake occurring the highest the usgs says 
is in the central california town of parkfield where there is a 90 
percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018

the us energy picture for the 1990s is a blur of dark lines 
and bright signs doubt about ensuring stable prices and steady 
supplies but also promise of technological leaps toward a more 
secure energy future 
such consumer advances as compact fluorescent light bulbs 
superwindows that better insulate buildings and more efficient 
refrigerator motors are just over the horizon the efficiency of 
these new products should partly offset the expanded use of 
electricity in the 90s 
energy projections over the past two decades have been 
astonishingly far off the mark proving that the energy economy is 
too volatile to follow a predictable path even so the consensus 
view is that oil prices now 16 to 18 a barrel will hold fairly 
steady in the early 1990s and then move moderately higher 
analysts are quick to note however that the trend in oil 
prices over the past two decades has been determined largely by 
political events and market reactions almost no one foresaw 
experts say forces already at work point to key energy themes 
for the 1990s 
more automobiles will be powered by fuels other than gasoline 
as the nation looks for environmentally safer alternatives that can 
lessen dependence on foreign oil some may use hydrogen gas made 
from water using electricity generated by the sun fuels made from 
natural gas coal and grain are likely to become more common 
the federal government will push harder to revive atomic power 
tax dollars may be used to develop a nuclear reactor with added 
safety features but public opposition to the atom is likely to 
persist a key focus of debate how to store growing tons of 
nuclear waste relatively clean energy from nuclear fusion will 
remain only a distant prospect 
decisions about developing traditional us energy resources 
oil natural gas and coal will become more intertwined with 
worries about the harmful environmental effects of finding 
extracting moving and burning these fossil fuels 
the nation will become more dependent on foreign oil and 
natural gas as domestic oil producers look abroad for drilling 
prospects 
houses and commercial buildings will become more 
energyefficient with compact fluorescent lights and other 
advanced appliances and superwindows whose glazing offers 
greater protection from the extremes of the air outside 
these trends suggest conflicting signals about american energy 
fortunes in the next decade new possibilities for popularizing 
more benign fuels but uncertainty about a commitment to move away 
from the most polluting ones especially oil 
the bush administration is already promoting a revival of 
nuclear energy stagnant since the mid1970s but electric 
utilities say major changes in state and federal regulations will 
be needed before they will build more plants 
complicating the outlook is a warning from the utility industry 
and many energy analysts that some regions especially the 
northeast could face electricity shortages early in the 1990s 
others foresee plenty of power if the government does more to push 
energy efficiency and conservation 
while energy sources favored by environmentalists including 
renewables such as sunlight wind water wood and geothermal 
steam are likely to gain more favor in the next decade america 
and the world still will run mainly on oil 
modern economies quite simply are wedded to oil little could 
change that in the 1990s 
it is and will continue to be the critical commodity in all of 
our economic and strategic planning well into the next century 
said henson moore the deputy us energy secretary 
joseph stanislaw an analyst in the paris office of cambridge 
energy research associates said the united states will face an oil 
crunch sometime in the 1990s if as expected us oil production 
keeps falling and demand keeps rising 
were like a shark driving through the water wanting more and 
more imported oil he said 
critical too then will be the actions of the opec oil cartel 
which teetered on the brink of extinction in the mid1980s but now 
seems poised for a comeback 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries engineered one 
of historys greatest transfers of wealth when it jacked up oil 
prices after the 197374 arab embargo against the united states and 
again in 1979 when oil buyers reacted with panic to a shutoff of 
iranian oil output 
almost no one in the west had foreseen those events nor did 
many expect the crises to create an energy conservation chic 
that would quickly discredit the mid1970s predictions that oil 
soon would shoot up to 100 a barrel 
after peaking at 40 a barrel in 1980 oils price fell 
steadily capped by a stunning and largely unforeseen collapse 
in 1986 to below 10 a barrel 
although energy developments of the past decade were largely a 
reaction to the oil price pain of the 70s trends in the coming 10 
years are likely to be determined by stillemerging responses to 
the price declines of the 80s 
the key uncertainties 
will the nations rapidly growing dependence on foreign oil 
undermine its security 
will oil imports rise so rapidly as to give opec renewed power 
to dictate prices 
if prices do stay low will efforts to develop alternate energy 
sources be abandoned will that in the longer run make the 
country even more beholden to opec

had you begun investing 1000 a year in stocks 
back in 1973 you might have an equity portfolio today worth more 
than 50000 
yes you can trust the stock market give it time and it always 
produces for those who choose wisely but try to outwit it in the 
short term and it can fight you to the death professional or 
amateur 
that 50000plus portfolio precisely 52740 at the end of 
1988 is the result of a theoretical 1000 a year invested in the 
standard amp poors 500stock index theoretical because there was 
no vehicle for so doing in 1973 
the point however is that the payoff would have come not from 
any maneuvering or spectacular luck but simply by playing the 
averages 
over time the averages work in your favor when the latest rages 
consume themselves and the fads lose their fans as sometimes 
happens overnight stock prices return to their basic values based 
on corporate quality 
but time or its expression in patience is seldom talked about 
in a marketplace where daytoday movements are magnified where 
advice changes by the hour where a premium is placed on 
anticipating daily movements 
time and quality work everytime even when economic hurricanes 
blow away shortterm values even through a depression 
ralph tate relates that had you begun investing 1000 a year in 
stocks in 1926 and continued to do so through the great 
depression your account based on the averages might have grown 
to 19700 by the end of 1940 
tate is an officer of aetna equity investors which analyzes 
with actuarial precision the investments of its parent the big 
insurance company because of their nature insurers must rely on 
rather steady longterm performance 
longterm however is not even in the vocabulary of many stock 
market participants they seek to play the market that one 
phrase does more harm to investing than any other says peter 
lynch 
lynch runs the fidelity magellan fund a huge mutual fund that 
owns records for longterm performance the phrase he said in an 
interview prior to the latest debacle causes people to think in 
terms of markets not companies 
and he adds the verb play means no work and instant 
gratification 
too many people he contends fail to do their homework before 
they buy a refrigerator he says they examine the models and 
prices but then they put 10000 into an inferior stock and say 
the market is rigged if it sinks 
if only they did onehours work he said you have an 
obligation to study and remain informed to be responsible to 
yourself investors he repeated must know the fundamentals of 
companies whose shares they own 
they cannot panic individual stocks are volatile my fund is 
volatile in the past 12 years it has declined 10 to 30 percent 
eight times but he suggested if you own fundamental value you 
can hold tight and win out 
knowing value means knowing everything you can about a company 
especially about the quality of its management its financial 
condition its products its earnings history it means monitoring 
the company for any changes 
it means standing firm when others lose their heads about 
economic events to spend time trying to predict the economy or 
the stock market just takes time out of your week says lynch 
youve got to study companies 
thats the word from a man extolled as one of the countrys 
wisest and most successful longterm money managers you dont 
worry about what the economy might do or the seers are saying you 
ignore the screams of the marketplace 
easier said than done of course otherwise it would be too 
easy everyone has the intelligence to make money in stocks 
says lynch do they have the stomach 
says tate people remember babe ruths 714 homers better than 
his 1330 strikeouts and they should think the same way about the 
stock market 
in a comment made before the latest sharp decline tate wished 
that more americans would recognize the quality of the stock 
markets longer term slugging percentage and not focus on the 
occassional dramatic strikeout

every two days americans generate almost a 
billion pounds of garbage the dumps can no longer hold it all 
this is one of a periodic series of articles the 90s looking 
ahead to the promise and peril of the upcoming decade in the 
environment medicine technology and society 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
by the end of the 1990s you may be paying by the pound to get 
rid of your garbage your home could have more recycling bins than 
trash cans and your supermarket food will probably come with a 
little less superwrapping 
solidwaste specialists say such changes are inevitable because 
of an upcoming crunch on the garbage front half the nations 6000 
dumps will be filled and closed in the 90s 
the ride into the recycling decade may be bumpy buyers for 
recycled newspaper glass and plastic are sometimes difficult to 
find breaking the generationsold habit of tossing everything into 
one garbage can may prove daunting new recycling systems need 
hefty upfront appropriations 
but the specialists see overwhelming motivations for change 
the cost of simply throwing things away is rising as 
communities ship their garbage farther and farther away and new 
environmental regulations make dump maintenance more expensive 
people are growing more concerned about cleaning up the planet 
a media generalassociated press poll earlier this year found that 
87 percent of americans would back a requirement to separate their 
trash for recycling 
environmental awareness is growing by leaps and bounds said 
sylvia lowrance director of the environmental protection agencys 
office of solid waste were going to see a lot of peer pressure 
neighborly pressure on people not to throw away everything 
in garbage the future is also the past greater recycling and 
reuse of discarded material would represent a return to preworld 
war ii ways in america including fewerfrills packaging on food 
products 
by the end of the decade i think recycling is going to be 
part of the cultural fabric of society said bruce weddle 
director of epas municipal solid waste program people will be 
separating out all bottles cans newspapers plastics leaves and 
grass clippings instead of throwing them in one can 
the transition will not occur overnight the experts say but 
even with the recalcitrant ones said lowrance when it hits 
their pocketbook they are going to become recyclers 
as it is now many communities go to great lengths to dump their 
garbage 
northeast states truck trash hundreds of miles to midwest dumps 
west coast cities ship it by rail to rural landfills because their 
hometown dumps have closed but much of the interstate garbage 
business is in jeopardy because landfills are closing and local 
residents oppose opening new ones to the outofstate waste 
in addition new epa landfill regulations due out in december 
will accelerate the garbage crunch by shutting down many antiquated 
dumps lowrance said she said the rules will require dump 
inspections and multilayered dump liners which prevent liquid 
from contaminating groundwater about 80 percent of the nations 
dumps do not have liners 
although all this makes recycling look more attractive most 
garbage specialists say recycling alone will not solve the garbage 
crisis 
they foresee a need to keep establishing new dumps especially 
sites serving entire regions and the building of more incinerators 
federal officials say the proportion of the nations garbage to 
go up in smoke from incinerators could rise by the year 2000 to 25 
percent from 10 percent the united states now has 149 
incinerators 227 are expected to be on line in 1992 incinerators 
have been opposed by environmentalists concerned over air 
pollution and the problem of disposing of toxic ash 
former epa administrator william ruckelshaus now chief 
executive of browningferris industries a solidwaste management 
company believes the garbage crisis demands an integrated solution 
of recycling burying and burning in a telephone interview he 
said local residents across the country have thwarted this approach 
by blocking new dumps and incinerators 
the idea that we are out of space is ridiculous epa needs to 
encourage states to adopt integrated energy plans he said 
americans now bury about 80 percent of their waste in dumps 
burn 10 percent and recycle the remainder the epa predicts 
recycling will jump to 25 percent by 1992 some states such as 
massachusetts have set a 50 percent recycling goal by the year 
2000 that would mean widespread recovery of food and yard waste 
which amounts to 23 percent of what is buried in dumps 
ten states now require communities to establish recycling 
programs and the the nations largest city new york has just 
embarked on a phasedin mandatory recycling program 
in seattle where the citys last dump closed three years ago 
residents pay 1375 a month per garbage can for curbside pickup 
in one neighborhood the city is experimenting with weighing 
individual households garbage garbagemen enter the weight into a 
truckboard computer and the bill is sent later 
seattles recycling is free residents separate newspapers junk 
mail aluminum grass clippings and even old latex paint 
said ginny stevenson spokeswoman for the citys recycling 
program the pocketbook was probably the biggest instigator for 
people to get involved in recycling 
as if to herald the recycling decade a new magazine on 
solidwaste management has arrived on the scene just in time for 
the 1990s its called simply garbage and its printed on 
recycled paper

to a new breed of environmentalist this 
northwest metropolis is a mecca 
we do dream about a different world says waste reduction 
project manager lorie parker one of nine seattle city employees 
plotting new ways to recycle solid waste we want to make 
recycling just as easy as throwing away garbage 
a new city booklet that shows the way on the road to 
recovery is being read by garbage specialists across the country 
the publication outlines the citys plans to recycle 60 percent 
of its waste by the end of the 1990s by the year 2010 the booklet 
predicts residents are buying more durable products than 
disposable products they are buying products with little or no 
packaging most homes have only one waste can but every room 
has a recycle can 
processing the recyclables has become a major industry in 
seattle employing hundreds of people 
in 1987 the city recycled 24 percent of its waste it is now up 
to 34 percent after starting its voluntary program last year 
residents recycle newspapers waste paper glass aluminum some 
plastics household toxic wastes ad steel garbage 
cans trucks pick up the separated material whcurbsides 
nd even their olrecycling is free but residents are charged by the 
barrel for 
trash 1375 a month per garbage can for curbside pickup 
the citys next recycling target is food and yard waste 
leaves grass clippings and the like officials want it collected 
processed composted and sold back to residents as highgrade mulch 
seattle is also experimenting with weighing peoples garbage and 
charging by the pound and is considering an intensive education 
program promoting the purchase of ich is left on 
durable goods the reuse of 
products and avoiding excessive packaging 
the rest of the country is watching seattles progress 
said bruce weddle director of the environmental protection 
agencys municipal waste program if i were a local official id 
look very closely at it

gained in the 1987 crash the new york stock exchange managed to 
handle the heavy volume because of a big investment in technology 
made after black monday 1987 
in addition traders were soothed by a promise during the 
weekend by the federal reserve to supply fresh money to the 
financial system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing 
to traders who lost money 
it turned out that little fed action was necessary as a 
precaution the central bank injected about 2 billion into the 
financial system on a day when it ordinarily would have drained 
reserves 
turmoil continued in the airline sector donald trump announced 
he was withdrawing his 7 billion bid for amr corp parent of 
american airlines after the companys stock had fallen he said he 
would consider a new offer at a lower price 
it was a failure to obtain financing for an employeemanagement 
buyout of united airlines parent ual corp that sparked fridays 
plunge a spokesman for british airways which is backing the 
buyout group said the group planned to pursue a takeover although

donald trumps 75 billion buyout proposal for 
amr corp was one of the casualties of the upheaval on wall street 
but observers expect the takeover business to recover 
trump himself indicated monday that he doesnt think the 
takeover game is over although he shelved his 120ashare bid for 
amr he said he may yet make another offer at a lower price for the 
parent of american airlines 
the developer attributed his withdrawal to the drop in amrs 
stock price he canceled his proposed bid after the price tumbled 
1375 a share to 8487 and the volatility on wall street amr 
closed 2212 lower on the day at 7650 
the dow jones industrial average recovered 88 points monday 
after plunging 190 points friday but other stocks lagged behind 
bluechip issues 
if the takeover business follows the precedent set after the 
market collapse of october 1987 when the dow jones average lost 
508 points on black monday alone it will go through a lull and 
then emerge from this crisis largely unscathed 
two years ago several takeover deals were abandoned or put on 
hold because the plunge in stock prices made the precrash offers 
too expensive 
carl icahn chairman of trans world airlines inc postponed his 
plans to take the airline private and dart group corp gave up its 
662 billion bid for the retailer dayton hudson corp 
but icahn achieved his goal a year later and although dart did 
not renew its offer for dayton hudson the company was back on the 
takeover trail just three months after the crash with an 
unsuccessful bid for stop amp shop cos inc 
and if you look at the broader picture some of the biggest 
takeovers of all time including the record 2453 billion buyout 
of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and the 129 
billion acquisition of kraft inc by philip morris cos inc were 
under way within a year of black monday 
i dont think the market scare will have any longterm 
impact said israel shaked a professor at boston universitys 
school of management looking at the record of takeovers since the 
1987 crash 
as long as we have companies that are undervalued and 
companies that are mismanaged takeovers will exist shaked said 
there may be changes in how deals are financed however 
especially because of recent reverses in the market for high 
yielding junk bonds 
the junkbond market was shaken recently after several big 
buyouts including campeau corps 66 billion takeover of 
federated department stores inc ran into trouble because the 
target firms werent generating enough cash to meet interest 
payments on the risky debt securities 
and although the planned employeemanagement buyout of ual corp 
didnt involve junk bonds the failure of banks to come up with 
loans to finance the 675 billion deal helped trigger fridays 
market tailspin 
bernard black a corporate finance professor at the columbia 
university school of law said buyers may be forced to depend more 
on equity and less on debt to complete their deals 
still deals will be aided by lower stock prices because the 
cost of buying a company falls along with the price of the firms 
shares 
low stock prices should be good for takeovers not bad 
black said we had nice healthy takeovers in 198386 with 
substantially lower prices

when the results of the past few tumultuous days 
on wall street are eventually added up many analysts contend they 
will mean more pluses than minuses for american consumers and 
businesses 
mondays 8812point rally in the dow jones industrial average 
to 265738 went a long way toward calming fears that the stock 
market was headed for some sort of replay of the crash of 1987 
in addition the rebound seemed to buttress the view that 
fridays 190point drop in the dow stemmed mainly from concerns 
about a single question the fading boom in corporate buyouts 
financed with borrowed money 
stocks of two airline holding companies ual corp and amr 
corp plunged in mondays trading responding to news that 
takeover proposals had run into snags or been withdrawn 
but in marked contrast to fridays session the shares of many 
bluechip companies not involved in takeover news or rumors staged 
a strong advance 
if takeover speculation is indeed on the wane observers say it 
would take away one of the prime forces that carried the stock 
market to record highs as recently as a week ago monday 
however they argue it also could reduce the perils of credit 
risk in the economy 
the unwinding of excesses in leveraged buyouts and junk bonds 
is very healthy said edward yardeni an economist at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
since the collapse of stock prices two years ago 
economywatchers have come to see sudden swings in the financial 
market in a new light 
unlike many past debacles the crash of 1987 neither 
foreshadowed nor caused a recession in fact many analysts 
contend it may have helped keep the economy in healthy shape in 
part by prompting the federal reserve to relax its credit policy 
similarly the jolt of fridays selloff is likely to shake the 
fed into a more accommodative stance than it would have otherwise 
pursued said david resler an economist at nomura securities 
international in new york 
if we do see a recession in 1990 i dont think it would be a 
result of this market drop 
if anything troubled observers about the stock markets recent 
behavior strange as it may sound it was not so much fridays 
slump as it was the abrupt rebound monday 
the comeback seemed to betoken complacency and perhaps an 
alltooeager readiness to dismiss the preweekend scare as a 
harmless correction 
yardeni for one suggested that the optimists might be 
overlooking a developing downward trend in corporate profits and 
other vital signs of the pace of business activity there is some 
genuine softness in the economy he said 
but as the market closed monday evening few observers claimed 
they would have been preferred to go through another fullblown 
crash 
as for investors in stocks mutual funds and other securities 
the markets wild gyrations seemed to make a new and compelling 
case for taking a longterm perspective 
the volatile hourbyhour atmosphere was full of potential 
pitfalls for anyone who tried to anticipate or react to shortterm 
price fluctuations for those who chose instead to ride out the 
storm the dow jones industrials monday close left it less than 
two points away from where it stood three weeks earlier at 
265919 on sept 25

donald dinsmore stepped outside and puffed 
nervously on a macanudo cigar during a break from a morning of 
frantic stock trading ten feet away scraggly anarchists burned 
fake money and shouted look out for falling stockbrokers 
also outside the new york stock exchange on monday helmeted 
police flanked japanese tourists waiting for a tour of the capital 
of capitalism 
its the place to be this morning in new york said laurent 
bijard 32 a writer for the french magazine le point visiting the 
city 
inside 12 minutes of frenetic floor activity defined a day that 
many feared would be a replay of black monday 1987 when the dow 
jones industrial average plunged 508 points in the greatest oneday 
crash ever 
at 1010 am the dow average of 30 bluechip stocks was down 
6313 points and falling six minutes later screams and cheers 
erupted when the critical market barometer recovered to stand less 
than 50 points down 
at 1018 it was down 39 points a minute later 29 another 
minute 10 more jubilation at 102228 when the dow moved into 
the black up 041 point the rise continued and the dow closed up 
8812 points erasing nearly half its friday the 13th dive that 
gave the market the willies 
i had butterflies in my stomach said dinsmore a 
56yearold floor specialist who has worked at the exchange 30 
years there was a lot of money on the line 
dinsmore said he doesnt drink but had plans for the days end 
anyway ill have a good stiff cigar 
as on previous occasions when the stock market made big news 
protesters flocked to wall street about a dozen police officers 
some on horseback and others on motorcycles were deployed nearby 
a group of selfdescribed anarchist squatters who occupy 
abandoned cityowned buildings rooted for another crash one 
blackscarved protester held a sign reading down with the dow 
revolution now 
for society to be reorganized the economic structure first 
has to experience a debilitating crash said a protester who gave 
his name as john squat we believe of course that a revolution 
would be what would come out of it 
the stock exchange closed its visitors gallery deploying 
tanuniformed sentries at all entrances but that didnt stop 
scores of curious tourists from milling around the building 
it might be a swell piece of history said john bissell 58 
a textile exporter from canton conn 
while protesters shouted look out for falling stockbrokers 
in an enduring image of the great crash of 1929 one wag walking 
down wall street before the market opened said they locked all 
the windows so they cant jump out

turmoil in the stock market is drawing attention 
once again to the sleepy area of financial services advertising 
the admakers at painewebber inc scrambled monday afternoon to 
make a new version of their longrunning painewebber special 
reports commercials that give the views of some of its top 
executives 
shearson lehman hutton inc meanwhile unveiled a new campaign 
debuting wednesday in which it stakes its claim to an industry 
leadership role 
merrill lynch amp co was already on the air during sundays 
baseball world series broadcast with commercials it has used before 
with the tagline a tradition of trust 
but smith barney harris upham amp co isnt likely to rerun the 
advertisement it placed in fridays wall street journal anytime 
soon 
what does an oldfashioned investment firm say to someone who 
fled to cds two years ago the ad said the environment that 
drove you into cds is not the environment of 1989 
the timing wasnt exactly propitious spokesman bob connor 
conceded monday even as the dow jones industrial average recouped 
8812 points of the 19058 it lost friday i dont think well 
run it again this week 
financial services advertising has been in the doldrums since 
spending fell sharply after the october 1987 market crash 
financial advertising on network television for instance was 
down 25 percent from a year ago in the first six months of 1989 
according to the television bureau of advertising 
advertising in the print media also has been soft as evinced by 
dow jones amp cos report last week that ad linage in the wall 
street journal was down 79 percent in the first nine months of the 
year 
the stock markets sharp selloff friday afternoon left no time 
for most financial services companies to come up with new 
advertising for the weekend 
but moments after the market closed monday afternoon 
painewebber was recording mary farrell a senior vice president and 
investment strategist for a oneminute commercial on her view of 
market developments 
the message farrell says that although wide swings may be 
inevitable in the short term the stock market is still the place 
to be for longterm appreciation 
some critics say investor confidence in the market is so low few 
people will pay any attention to such pronouncements 
but john lampe advertising director for painewebber said he 
wanted to get the commercial on the air immediately 
it shows the people that are watching the commercials that we 
are on top of what is going on in the marketplace and are trying to 
be upfront and candid about our advice he said 
shearson hired a new ad agency last spring and the new campaign 
leadership by example is the first offering produced by ally amp 
gargano inc 
hardwick simmons shearsons vice chairman said the ads were 
designed to tout the firms leadership role in areas such as 
overthecounter stocks municipal bonds and assets under 
management without making the firm appear arrogant or 
yuppielike 
five commercials have been created in one a european company 
in need of 300 million is depicted as turning to shearson which 
tapped its tokyo new york and geneva offices to arrange low cost 
financing within 24 hours 
in another ad scenes of russians chinese and east europeans 
enjoying the fruits of capitalism like skateboards hot dogs and 
fancy sneakers are shown to illustrate that shearson stands ready 
to help expand the free enterprise system globally 
the campaign and the scheduling of its debut during wednesday 
nights boradcast of the world series baseball game were determined 
well before fridays market fall and mondays partial recovery

a house aviation subcommittee approved 
legislation requiring government review of takeovers of major 
airlines after witnesses said leveraged buyouts could threaten 
safety if purchasers are servicing their debt instead of serving 
their passengers 
the bill passed monday by voice vote would give the 
transportation department up to 50 days to block the purchase of at 
least 15 percent of a major carriers voting stock 
the fast action on the bill introduced only last week was 
spurred by donald trumps proposed 75 billion takeover of amr 
corp of fort worth parent of american airlines but trump said 
monday he was withdrawing his offer although he may come back 
later with another proposal 
in a letter to rep james l oberstar chairman of the aviation 
subcommittee trump said the perception that such legislation may 
be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the united 
airlines takeover attempt and fridays disruption in the financial 
markets 
trump also said attempts to rush legislation through congress 
cannot be in the interest of anyone but amr executives 
backers of the bill however said the legislation was not 
written for amr or any particular airline similar legislation has 
already been approved by the senate commerce science and 
transportation committee 
despite strong support in the house public works and 
transportation committee the bush administration opposes the bill 
according to a letter to oberstar from elaine l chao deputy 
secretary of transportation 
she said the department already has sufficient authority to act 
when an acquisition raises questions about an air carriers fitness 
oberstars bill would allow the transportation department to 
block an airline takeover if the carrier would be financially 
weakened and safety would deteriorate if a major reduction in 
assests would occur or if control would go to a foreign interest 
the full committee is scheduled to vote on the bill either today or 
wednesday 
there is a widespread feeling that leveraged buyouts ought to 
be subject to review and some degree of regulation so they do not 
jeopardize the potential for competition in the nations air 
transportation system oberstar dminn said 
due to recent mergers the countrys top eight airlines control 
than 90 percent of domestic air traffic oberstar said 
the traveling public cannot afford to have one of these 
remaining major airlines dismantled or seriously disabled as an 
effective competitor by the burden of servicing excessive debt 
resulting from a leveraged buyout oberstar said adding that 
congress and the government must be vigilant in ensuring safety 
isnt compromised 
michael kelliher president of the association of professional 
flight attendants which represents the 15000 american airlines 
flight attendants said those employees have no desire to become 
pawns in a corporate chess game 
our flight attendants would strongly object to working as 
hard as we do to service inflated junk bond interest debt 
accumulated for reasons contrary to keeping our airline healthy 
he said 
also voicing support for the bill were representatives of the 
independent federation of flight attendants the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers the transport 
workers union of america and the association of flight attendants

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in a 
pitch for strong capital standards told bankers at their annual 
convention that banks like many other corporations today are highly 
leveraged 
greenspan addressing the american bankers association on 
monday cited recent efforts by banks to build their capital the 
cushion that protects government insurance funds and by extension 
the taxpayers from losses 
but he added despite the progress many of you have made in 
recent years capital levels for the industry remain at the low 
end of their broad historical range 
current levels of 63 percent of assets are onesixth the 
levels of the mid1800s and are less than onehalf the level some 
50 years ago he said 
in some ways the trend for banks mirrors the trend for 
corporations generally which in recent years have taken on more 
debt keeping their equity ratios low 
greenspan pointedly refrained from commenting on the sharp 
dispute dividing two other banking agencies the federal deposit 
insurance corp and the office of the comptroller of the currency 
both agencies have agreed on a new riskbased capital standard 
that gives banks a break for holding relatively safe investments 
such as government securities and home mortgages however they 
disagree over a second capital standard called a leverage ratio 
meant to stop banks from sharply reducing their capital by 
restructuring their holdings 
the fdic which insures bank deposits is pushing for a leverage 
ratio of 45 percent but the comptrollers office an arm of the 
treasury department which charters national banks wants 3 percent 
fdic chairman l william seidman said the comptrollers proposal 
would reduce standards for 90 percent of the nations banks 
allowing the industry as a whole to hold 8 billion less of a 
safety cushion however comptroller robert l clarke said 
seidmans proposal would dampen the features of the riskbased 
standard designed to encourage banks to make safe investments 
i do not wish to debate the details of which specific ratios 
or standards are most appropriate to assess capital adequacy 
greenspan said but it is important to keep in mind that in both 
relative and absolute terms banking is a highly leveraged 
industry 
he said bank owners have an incentive to minimize their capital 
as a way of maximizing their stockholders return however when a 
financial institution holds inadequate capital its owners do not 
have the proper exposure to limit risky activity he said 
moreover the risks in banking today are arguably higher than 
they were in the days when banks had higher capital ratios the 
chairman said 
the number and size of failures we have seen in both the 
banking and thrift industries demonstrate clearly that depository 
institutions must maintain sound capital positions and be able to 
deal with unexpected events he said 
greenspan made only a brief reference to the turmoil in world 
stock markets on friday and monday greenspan said the fed had also 
been in productive contact with foreign governments but did 
not elaborate on what actions the united states and other 
governments were taking

bankers at their annual convention noted the 
increasing competition from credit unions and cried foul 
a study released monday by the american bankers association 
concludes that credit unions which as nonprofit organizations are 
taxexempt serve members who are economically better off than most 
americans 
it is ironic that credit union members have higher incomes 
yet banks are subject to federal income taxes said thomas p 
rideout outgoing president of the aba and vice chairman of first 
union national bank of north carolina 
the report prepared by the secura group a consulting firm 
headed by former bank regulator william issac said 49 percent of 
credit union members had annual incomes between 30000 and 
80000 compared with 32 percent of nonmembers in the us 
population 
moreover by loosely interpreting membership requirements 
credit unions have grown from 69 billion in assets in 1980 to 196 
billion at the end of last year it said their membership reached 
60 million this year 34 percent of all adults in the country up 
from 40 million 20 years ago 
a spokeswoman for a credit union trade group susan broaddus of 
the national association of federal credit unions denounced the 
bankers survey saying credit unions are a whole different 
animal from banks 
they serve a wide spectrum of income levels theyre not 
for profit and they operate with a lot of volunteer support 
she said the whole aba effort was not to get objective data on 
credit unions but an attempt to bolster their case 
the banking trade group has made the imposition of taxes on 
credit unions one of the key parts in its fight to persuade 
congress to permit it to compete more effectively 
but at a panel discussion featuring members of congress the 
bankers were told they were fighting an uphill battle against 
credit unions which can muster strong grassroots lobbying 
if i wanted to tax credit unions i would do so the day after 
i announced by retirement said rep stan parris rva

donald trump said he might consider a lower offer 
for amr corp after withdrawing his 7 billion bid for the parent 
of american airlines but opponents approved a plan to give the 
government power to block a buyout 
the billionaire developer said he was pulling his 120ashare 
offer for the nations largest airline because of the stock market 
turmoil triggered in part by a buyout attempt for the nations no 
2 airline 
amr stock plunged in heavy trading on the new york stock 
exchange following word of trumps withdrawal finishing down 
2212 a share at 7650 
union leaders and several congressmen have criticized the 
takeover proposal saying it would saddle amr with such a heavy 
debt it would be forced to sell assets and cut corners on safety 
before trump announced his withdrawal opponents testified 
before a house subcommittee in support of a bill that would give 
the transportation department up to 50 days to block the takeover 
of at least 15 percent of the voting stock of a major air carrier 
the subcommittee chaired by rep james oberstar dminn 
approved the bill which was to be taken up wednesday by the full 
house public works and transportation committee 
a senate committee already has approved a bill with similar 
provisions and many including sen lloyd bentsen dtexas had 
indicated they would amend the bill to make it cover trumps amr 
plans 
trump sent a letter to oberstar on monday accusing amr 
management of obvious selfinterest in supporting the 
legislation he said attempts to rush legislation through congress 
cannot be in the interest of anyone but amr executives 
but bentsen said i think mr trump has elected the wisest 
course taking a solid airline like american and piling it up with 
65 billion worth of debt was illadvised from the start i hope 
trumps withdrawal is a fullscale retreat 
in a twoparagraph letter to amr trump said i am currently 
reviewing all my options with respect to amr including making 
another offer at a lower price increasing my existing position in 
amr selling my amr stock or taking other actions that i may deem 
appropriate 
trump organization officials said there would be no further 
comment 
amr greeted the news with the same silence it has maintained 
since trump unveiled his bid for the nations largest airline on 
oct 5 
but baggage and freight handlers said they would continue to 
support the current management and oppose trump 
trumps has a history of buying shares of companies making 
takeover noises and later selling his stock on the subsequent 
speculationrelated runup or when a third party bidder emerged 
mondays slide in amr stock continued a plunge that began last 
friday when news that a managementemployee group was unable to 
obtain financing for its planned 675 billion buyout of united 
airlines parent ual corp triggered the secondbiggest oneday 
point drop in stock market history 
analysts said monday a second lower offer by trump might be 
even more difficult 
he supposedly has taken a look at the earnings power of this 
corporation and said its worth 120 a share said kevin burke 
a transportation analyst at first union corp in charlotte nc 
david pizzimenti an analyst at nomura research 
instituteamerica said a price lower than 120 a share would be 
undervalued and an already reluctant amr board would be unlikely 
to accept anything less

program traders were notably absent as the stock 
and stockindex futures markets rebounded experts said 
but it wasnt for lack of opportunity as standard amp poors 500 
index futures sometimes traded at wide variances to the underlying 
cash index monday offering potential profits for those willing to 
buy one and sell the other 
futures ended the session at a sizeable premium the contract 
for december delivery of the 500 stocks tracked by the sampp 500 
index settled 1565 points higher at 34450 on the chicago 
mercantile exchange while the cash index finished at 34286 
traders and analysts speculated that program traders sat out the 
session either out of caution or concern that their largescale 
trades might unnerve smaller investors 
i would assume the firms that do program trading knew it was a 
crucial day for people to have confidence in the market said 
william finke a vice president of shearson lehman hutton inc in 
chicago 
john legittino vice president of elders futures inc guessed 
that the computer traders were sitting on the sidelines to see 
how the whole thing unfolds 
stockindex futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of 
stocks at specified prices by a specified date 
program trading employs computers to buy and sell huge blocks of 
stocks and index futures in an attempt to profit from minute 
differences in prices on the two markets the practice can cause 
rapid price swings and is believed by some to have accelerated the 
stockmarket collapse of oct 19 1987 
traders and analysts attributed mondays rally to a resurgence 
of investor confidence following a 30point plunge in the sampp 500 
futures on friday when the dow jones industrial average plunged by 
190 points 
the dow rallied by just over 88 points on monday 
in addition to the dearth of program trading experts said 
supportive factors included the encouraging performance of the 
tokyo stock exchange earlier monday where the main market 
barometer fell by a modest 18 percent and the stated 
determination of british airways plc to continue with an 
employeemanagement group to seek to buy united airlines parent 
ual corp 
failure of the buyout group to arrange financing of the deal 
helped trigger fridays market plunge

prices on the tokyo stock exchange rebounded 
sharply today and the dollar rallied as mondays strong recovery on 
wall street restored confidence in the financial markets 
other asian stock markets also surged ahead today apparently 
reassured that a repeat of the global crash of 1987 wasnt in the 
making 
news that the dow jones industrial average rose by more than 88 
points on monday reversing almost half of fridays big 190point 
selloff helped propel the tokyo market to its secondbiggest point 
gain of the year 
the nikkei stock average jumped by 52739 points or 153 
percent to 3499608 the rally erased most of mondays 
64733point plunge 
traders said volume was a moderate 650 million shares up from 
mondays thin total of 520 million shares 
japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto praised coordination 
between financial authorities of the group of seven leading 
industrial nations during the stock crisis he also repeated 
remarks he made monday that he wasnt seriously concerned about the 
impact of fridays plunge in new york 
i dont think markets moved that sharply he said at a press 
conference after a regular cabinet meeting 
a dealer at nomura securities who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said one reason fridays wall street plunge didnt lead 
to another crash was because interest rates are lower today than 
two years ago 
the crash in new york on friday was not linked to uneasiness 
about funds as was the crash of black monday the dealer said 
referring to the record 508point fall in the dow industrials on 
oct 19 1987 
but haruhito ichimura a trader with nippon kangyo kakumaru 
securities said it was too early to tell whether wall street had 
recovered completely from its fall 
mitsuhiko kinugasa a dealer with daiwa bank said there were 
rumors tuesday that japanese banks again were backing away from a 
revised plan for financing a buyout of united airlines parent 
company although they had little impact on share prices 
the refusal of banks many japanese to support the proposed 
675 billion buyout helped trigger last fridays plunge on wall 
street a citibank spokesman in tokyo said the bank was presenting 
a revised financing package for a bid of 250 a share down from 
300 a share under the original plan but uniteds pilots denied 
there was any formal offer at the lower price 
the us dollar ended trading at 14225 yen in tokyo up 150 
yen from monday it moved within a range of 14180 yen to 14235 
yen during the day 
elsewhere in asia tuesday hong kongs hang seng index surged 
9420 points to close at 269590 recovering some of the ground 
lost monday when it fell 65 percent 
indexes in australia and new zealand which fell about 8 percent 
on monday finished today with gains of 38 percent and 57 
percent respectively 
taiwans stock index gained 41032 points to close at 1010052 
it was the markets biggest oneday point gain ever and more than 
erased mondays decline of 32948 
the recovery on wall street relieves worries over a worldwide 
crash and draws bargainhunters said one taiwan broker who 
spoke on condition of anonymity

fridays 190point drop had raised fears of a repeat of october 
1987 when a friday decline turned into an oct 19 monday rout 
that knocked a record 508 points off the average that did not turn 
out to be the case this time 
stocks held up while the us bond market fell steeply and 
foreign stock markets showed widespread weakness 
stock indexes monday fell 18 percent in tokyo 32 percent in 
london and a steep 128 percent in frankfurt west germany where 
one trader described trading as a blood bath 
the dollars value tracked the stock market and was mixed 
against major currencies 
traders said the stock market benefited from the experience 
gained in the 1987 crash the new york stock exchange managed to 
handle the heavy trading volume because of a big investment in 
technology made after the crash 
in addition traders were soothed by a promise over the weekend 
by the federal reserve to supply fresh money to the financial 
system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing to 
traders who lost money 
it turned out that little action by the fed was necessary as a 
precaution the central bank injected about 2 billion into the 
financial system on a day when it ordinarily would have drained 
reserves 
turmoil continued in the airline sector donald trump announced 
he was withdrawing his 7 billion bid for amr corp parent of 
american airlines after the companys stock fell in the broad 
market plunge he said he would consider a new offer at a lower 
price 
it was a failure to obtain financing for an employeemanagement 
buyout of united airlines parent ual corp that sparked fridays 
plunge a spokesman for british airways plc which is backing the 
buyout group said the group still planned to pursue a takeover 
although the terms of the deal were under review 
there were communications all day monday between the stock 
exchanges the federal reserve and the securities and exchange

house and senate democratic leaders met today 
to map out strategy for completing an emergency deficitreduction 
bill that would roll back automatic spending cuts mandated by the 
grammrudman law 
but the white house said it may no longer accept legislation to 
reverse the arbitrary cutbacks which slash more than 8 billion 
each from defense and domestic programs to reduce the federal 
deficit 
there is some feeling here that the automatic cuts are the 
way to go it will reduce spending in a very effective fashion 
said marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman who announced 
monday night that president bush had ordered the cuts as required 
by the grammrudman law 
the white house and the senate had pushed the house to accept 
monday their deal on a strippeddown deficit package which 
would have allowed bush to avoid ordering the cuts 
the house brushed aside that suggestion leaders of both parties 
said they could not so easily jettison their version of the budget 
bill which included action on some of the years most contentious 
issues 
in two weeks of sometimes furious debate the house voted to cut 
the capital gains tax multiply federal aid for child care and 
repeal the medicare catastrophic illness plan along with a host 
of other political favorites 
were not suddenly going to abandon them said rep leon 
panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget committee 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine met with house 
democratic leaders on the topic this morning he said formal 
negotiations between the two chambers could begin as early as this 
afternoon 
panetta and speaker thomas s foley dwash spent monday 
meeting with other house leaders panetta said they hope to develop 
a plan this week to produce a housesenate deficit reduction bill 
and send the senate a separate bill including the other issues 
without forcing new house votes 
rep bill frenzel rminn the ranking republican on the budget 
committee said gop members wanted to make sure their favorite 
measures in the old house bill retained their status 
we are anxious to work with the democrats to obviate the 
need for the grammrudman cuts he said but republicans he 
said were a little less frantic 
the order signed by bush monday night cut 43 percent from 
pentagon programs and 53 percent from domestic agencies except 
for social security and poverty programs 
the cuts would reduce the deficit for fiscal 1990 by 161 
billion they were required by the grammrudman law because 
congress and the president have not been able to agree on an 
alternative way to cut the projected deficit below 110 billion 
although few immediate disruptions were expected in the short 
term the cuts could have widespread effects if not reversed 
layoffs in the military furloughs of air traffic controllers and 
cancellation of thousands of student loans could be expected 
richard darman the presidents budget director also said he 
thought sticking with the acrosstheboard cuts might be better 
than accepting legislation to undo them 
sen james sasser dtenn the chairman of the senate budget 
committee said the deficit bill could have been in place weeks ago 
except for the administrations obsession with attaching to it 
the presidents cherished capital gains tax cut 
he said if the automatic cuts were to remain in place it would 
put a real torpedo in the side of education and other important 
programs such as defense and fighting illegal drugs which bush 
supports 
darmans bellicose statements that hed accept the cuts 
amounted to a lot of breastbeating he said

the boeing co has agreed to resume negotiations 
with striking machinists but called off talks with engineers 
seeking a new labor contract because of grossly excessive 
payraise demands 
boeing spokesman harold carr said the company and the seattle 
professional engineering employees association met monday the 
first of two days of negotiations 
the company has advised speea that because of its unrealistic 
and grossly excessive economic proposal boeing canceled a 
meeting scheduled for today carr said monday 
the union which represents 28000 engineers and technical 
support workers said last week it was seeking pay raises of 19 
percent in the first year and 8 percent in the second and third 
years of a threeyear contract the current contract expires dec 1 
dan mahoney engineers union spokesman late monday had no 
comment on boeings action 
sepparately boeing agreed to return wednesday to the bargaining 
table with the machinists federal mediator doug hammond said he 
believes the time is right to resume talks 
a strike by 57800 members of the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers enters its third week wednesday 
carr refused to say if the company had improved its offer 
we welcome a chance to see whether boeing has reevaluated its 
position union spokesman matt bates said 
the machinists walked out on oct 4 they voted 85 percent 
against a new contract offer from the worlds largest commercial 
jet builder which is enjoying its fifth straight year of 
recordhigh orders 
about 43300 strikers are in the seattle area 12000 in 
wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and lesser numbers at a 
halfdozen other locations 
boeings threeyear offer to the machinists included wage hikes 
of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 percent bonuses of 8 percent of 
gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990 a costofliving clause 
almost matching inflation a reduction in mandatory overtime and 
increases in some benefits

the us trade deficit widened dramatically to 
1077 billion in august the biggest imbalance in eight months 
the government said today in a report which sent stock prices 
tumbling at the start of trading 
the commerce department said the august shortfall between 
imports and exports was 308 percent higher than a revised july 
deficit of 824 billion 
while analysts had been expecting the trade deficit to worsen in 
august the actual figure was much higher than a consensus forecast 
for a deficit of around 9 billion 
unexpectedly bad trade reports have in times past sent shock 
waves through financial markets first causing the dollar to 
plunge with the weaker us currency acting to pull down stock 
prices as well 
the dollar dipped in early trading and stock prices opened 
sharply lower 
the dow jones industrial average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 
2459 at the opening but the loss was cut to 1250 within 30 
minutes traders attributed the early selloff to concerns that the 
trade deficit was worsening and that could lead to higher interest 
rates 
the august deficit was the worst trade imbalance since a 1080 
billion deficit last december 
the widening gap resulted from a 02 percent decline in exports 
to 304 billion and a 64 percent increase in imports to 412 
billion 
this is of course an unwelcome increase and were hopeful that 
it simply is a onemonth situation and will turn around said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
asked if the administration feared the trade figures would drive 
down the market fitzwater said the market seems stable and the 
economy is sound and there is no cause for disruption of that 
kind 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the level of imports 
was a record but was primarily due to higher purchases of capital 
goods which are used to produce other goods this increase supports 
growing capacity in the manufacturing sector 
mosbacher noting the volatility of the monthly trade reports 
added that looking at the longerrun trends we see that the 
trade balance for the first eight months of 1989 of 731 billion 
continues to be substantially below the total for the same period 
last year of 788 billion or 1022 billion for the same period 
in 1987 
while exports have increased by about 15 percent so far this 
year and by 48 percent compared to the same period in 1987 we note 
that exports remain high but growth has slowed in recent months 
he said 
the august deficit was the first increase since may 
economists had been watching to see what effect the rising value 
of the dollar would have on the trade imbalance a stronger dollar 
tends to widen the trade gap by making us goods more expensive 
overseas while lowering the price of imports to american consumers 
rising imports tend to curb demand for usproduced goods thus 
dampening production and threatening the loss of jobs 
exports on the other hand strengthen demand on domestic 
production and help create more jobs 
preliminary estimates had put the deficit in august at about 9 
billion 
the nations foreign oil bill increased 04 percent to 43 
billion in august the amount of imported oil rose to 867 million 
barrels a day from 814 million in july but the price per barrel 
fell to 1614 from 1712 
in addition to oil increased imports included manufactured 
goods such as electrical machinery clothing and footwear 
analysts had said a big decrease in airplane and aircraft 
exports would contribute to the widening of the august deficit 
such exports were off 161 percent the commerce department said 
for the first eight months of the year exports increased 146 
percent while imports rose 187 percent 
the deficit for the year on an annual rate was 1097 billion 
the deficit totaled 1185 billion in all of 1988 
as usual the largest trade deficit in august was with japan an 
imbalance of 399 billion down from 4 billion in july the 
deficit was 14 billion with taiwan 12 billion with canada 
700 million with south korea and 600 million with china 
the july trade gap of 824 billion was the slimmest since a 
679 billion imbalance in december 1984 and compared with a 801 
billion deficit in june and a 101 billion deficit in may

an audit showed that lincoln savings and loan 
association was in such poor condition that it warranted an 
immediate crackdown more than three years before the government 
seized the institution a federal regulator said today 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said the march 12 1986 audit by the san francisco branch of 
the federal home loan bank board found that lincoln had violated 
rules limiting risky direct investments in commercial ventures was 
not in compliance with accounting standards had substantial loan 
losses had inadequate and missing records and was speculating in 
options trading 
the fdic which insures bank and sampl deposits took control of 
lincoln of irvine calif last april after sampl regulators at the 
bank board declared it insolvent 
seidman in sworn testimony to the house banking committee 
estimated that the failure of lincoln would eventually cost 
taxpayers between 15 billion and 2 billion making it the 
costliest sampl collapse in the nations history 
had the fdic been in charge of supervising lincoln in 1986 it 
would have moved to stop the abuses seidman said my staff 
indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own 
institutions we would have sought an immediate ceaseanddesist 
order to stop the hazardous operations he said 
the fdic under orders from president bush began taking over 
insolvent sampls in february removing them from the jurisdiction of 
the nowdefunct bank board headed by m danny wall 
since the lincoln takeover the government has filed a 11 
billion fraud and racketeering suit against phoenix millionaire 
charles h keating jr chairman of lincolns parent american 
continental corp it charges that keating his family and 
associates diverted funds from lincolns depositors for their 
personal use 
a key question of the hearings is why the bank board under wall 
after meeting with keating transferred the task of regulating 
lincoln to washington from the agencys san francisco office 
the san franciscobased regulators recommended in the spring of 
1987 that lincoln be seized however after keating complained that 
he was being treated unfairly wall ordered another examination by 
regulators in washington delaying action against lincoln until 
this year 
the sad fact about this failure is that the warning signs were 
there and the stop signs posted in time to prevent much of the loss 
to the insurance fund said rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
banking committee chairman 
but the federal home loan bank board instead waved the 
institution through the stop signals and let it continue racing 
down the fast land until it crashed 
institutions like lincoln savings and loan should never be 
allowed to poison our financial system said rep chalmers wylie 
of ohio the senior republican on the banking committee lincoln 
was a rogue elephant the fact that this institution was 
federally insured is frightening 
because of congressional protocol the house committee is 
unlikely to deeply explore the role of five senators who received 
campaign contributions from keating sens alan cranston dcalif 
dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz john glenn 
dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich met with regulators in 
april 1987 to question them about lincoln 
deconcini and riegle have since returned the contributions but 
the selfstyled citizens lobby common cause last week asked the 
senate ethics committee to investigate the matter 
last week the banking panel voted to subpoena federal and 
california regulators private accountants and keating himself 
additional hearings are scheduled oct 24 oct 31 and nov 7 
keating and wall are not scheduled to appear until the last session 
during the debate of the sampl bill gonzalez had sought 
unsuccessfully to force wall to be reconfirmed by the senate in his 
new position as director of the office of thrift supervision an 
arm of the treasury department created to replace the bank board 
however as part of the compromise to get the legislation 
enacted gonzalez dropped his objection to wall who was strongly 
supported by sen jake garn of utah the senior republican on the 
senate banking committee

ford motor co said tuesday it raised its stake in 
the luxury car maker jaguar plc to 104 percent from 5 percent 
the us auto maker said it held 19 million jaguar shares at the 
end trading monday 
the increase signals fords commitment to pursue the purchase of 
up to 15 percent of jaguar possibly as the prelude to a full bid 
some analysts had speculated that ford might withdraw its plans 
announced in midseptember because of an expected production and 
equitysharing link between jaguar and general motors corp 
jaguar is negotiating a deal with gm that would maintain the 
british companys independence and jaguar has spurned fords 
approaches 
under jaguars bylaws ford and other outside shareholders are 
prohibited from acquiring more than 15 percent of the company until 
the end of next year 
the condition was imposed by the british government when it 
privatized jaguar in 1984

control data corp on tuesday 
announced development of a mainframe computer it expects to begin 
shipping in the second half of 1990 
the cyber 2000 is a 23 million machine that eventually will 
replace its biggest mainframe the cyber 990 the new machine 
based on control datas own proprietary technology will have twice 
the computing power of its predecessors the company said 
the computer company also announced a technologysharing 
agreement with mips computer systems inc of sunnyvale calif to 
design the brains of its future computers 
the joint development agreement with mips means control data 
will use a streamlined chip design known as reduced instruction set 
computing or risc developed by that firm that is a departure 
from using chips of the companys own design 
as early as next year control data expects to be selling 
specialized computers based on the technology but it also will 
conduct joint development of projects further in the future said 
e j otis senior vice president 
as we move forward risc technology will pervade all cdc 
projects otis said 
risc computer chips cannot carry out all the functions of more 
generalpurpose chips that have traditionally been the central 
processors in computers but they are faster and are gaining 
acceptance for computers performing intensive numerical operations 
or producing sophisticated graphics 
the move by control data is related to the layoff of 95 research 
and development people last week at control datas arden hills 
facility because the company will rely on someone else to design 
the central processing chips of future computers it no longer 
needs the employees who have been designing its own proprietary 
chips 
in agreeing to obtain that technology control data is 
recognizing that they cant do it all said analyst gary smaby of 
the smaby group in minneapolis 
as for the new mainframe computer smaby said it keeps them 
in the ball game a lot of people out there had thought they 
had fallen so far behind they couldnt get back in anymore

us treasury bonds made moderate price gains 
today as the market once again rallied at the expense of an 
unsteady stock market 
market analysts said a downturn in stock prices today following 
mondays partial rebound from the sharp loss on friday sent many 
investors and to the relative safety of bonds 
the outlook seems to have worsened for stocks said robert 
a brusca chief financial economist for nikko securities co 
international 
at noon edt the dow jones industrial average was down 2787 at 
262951 
the stock market was concerned in part over the release of a 
government report today showing the nations august trade deficit 
widening to 1077 billion from a revised july deficit of 824 
billion 
bond investors werent as worried analysts said 
depsite the fact that the trade deficit was worse than people 
had generally looked for it gave evidence that production in the 
us was sluggish and the economy of the us is not strong at the 
moment explained carol a stone senior economist for nomura 
securities inc 
fanning that feeling about the economy as well as hopes that 
interest rates had room to decline was another government report 
today showing industrial production edging down 01 percent in 
september she said 
by midday today in the secondary market for treasury bonds the 
bellwether 30year issue was up point or 625 per 1000 face 
amount its yield which moves inversely from its price fell to 
791 percent from 797 percent

prices of shortterm government issues were up around point 
intermediate maturities rose between point and point and 
longterm issues rose between point and point according to 
figures provided by telerate inc a financialinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer stood at 119108 up 193

two financial exchanges are among parties that 
have agreed to help guarantee backing for an options trading firm 
hit hard by fridays stock market collapse a spokesman for 
continental banks options unit said tuesday 
under the rescue plan most of the customer accounts of 
chicagobased fossett corp are being transferred to first options 
of chicago the banks options unit said first options spokesman 
bill murschel 
the unit agreed over the weekend to acquire fossetts customer 
accounts in exchange for financial guarantees from the chicago 
board options exchange the american stock exchange and 
chicagobased options clearing corp murschel said in a telephone 
interview 
about 200 fossett accounts are being transferred to first 
options in a transaction expected to be completed tuesday he said 
the clearing corporation which is owned by the nations options 
markets pledged 20 million while the cboe offered 8 million in 
guarantees and the american stock exchange offered 4 million the 
chicago tribune reported in tuesdays editions citing sources it 
did not identify 
stephen fossett the companys president pledged about 18 
million to the continental operation for a total of 50 million 
fossett was not in his office and did not immediately return a 
telephone message seeking comment on how much his firm lost last 
friday 
but sources who asked not to be identified told the associated 
press 50 million is the worst loss fossett would face if the 
market continues to slide 
that loss would have had to appear to be likely for fossett to 
agree to the transfer sources said adding that it probably wont 
be determined until the end of the week if the guarantees will be 
needed 
the transfer of accounts is not unusual the sources said but 
the guarantees offered by the exchanges are unprecedented 
if a given firm is experiencing troubles and it was obvious 
late friday that this firm was experiencing troubles the clearing 
organization can step in and work with that firm and transfer 
accounts of that firm to a healthy firm said a source who asked 
not to be identified 
the fossett firm processes and guarantees trades of close to 200 
professional options traders known as market makers there was 
concern that the firm wouldnt be able to meet numerous demands for 
cash to back losing options positions if fridays market decline 
spilled over into monday 
murschel said the transfer of accounts was taking place despite 
the markets imrpovement monday 
under the agreement assets of the firm and its president would 
be used first followed by those of the clearing corporation the 
cboe and amex 
we felt it was very important that fossett not be allowed to 
liquidate said alger chapman cboe chairman so did the 
options clearing corp and the american stock exchange 
it was simply not in the markets interest to have to 
liquidate a firm coming on the heels of friday when the market 
dropped 190 points chapman said 
it is the first time we have taken such a step and hopefully 
it will be the last he said 
continental and its federal regulators wanted the guarantees to 
limit the banks exposure in the event of a continued market 
collapse the newspaper said 
again citing unidentified sources the tribune said continental 
was especially concerned about the potential damage because of its 
own options troubles during the stock market crash two years ago 
heavy losses at that time saddled the bank unit with a 90 
million loss

the federal reserve taking the lead in 
handling the governments market rescue efforts pumped an 
additional 15 billion into the us banking system today as the 
stock market focused on an unexpectedly bad trade report 
banks will be able to use the new reserves to make loans 
including coming to the assistance of brokerage firms caught in a 
cash squeeze because of the drop in stock prices 
the new infusion of cash followed an increase of 2 billion in 
reserves supplied by the central bank on monday and came as the 
stock market was tumbling in reaction to a surprisingly bad 
economic report 
the government said the merchandise trade deficit in august 
widened dramatically to 1077 billion the worst deficit since 
december of last year 
the bad trade report triggered a selloff on the stock market 
with the dow jones industrial average off almost 30 points at 
midday as investors worried about more volatility in a market 
which has plunged and surged over the previous two trading days 
the fresh infusions of cash on the part of the fed were an 
effort by the central bank to back up its pledge to keep the friday 
the 13th stock market plunge from having a disastrous ripple effect 
through the financial system 
some private economists have expressed worries that by pumping 
up the us money supply the central bank was running the risk of 
making inflation worse and weakening the value of the us dollar 
but fed officials discounted those fears and said they stood ready 
to supply more money if needed to insulate the banking system from 
the stock market turmoil 
for its part the bush administration was playing down any 
worries over the dollar or inflation preferring to bask instead in 
successfully keeping the markets 190point plunge on friday the 
13th from becoming a rerun of 1987s black monday 
instead of another huge drop the market rallied monday to 
regain nearly half of the losses suffered on friday leaving the 
administration breathing a sigh of relief 
calm and cool has prevailed said one treasury official who 
spoke after the markets closed on monday 
many economists said they believed the feds 2 billion infusion 
on monday threatened the dollars stability by driving down us 
interest rates 
reducing interest rates too much could bring the dollar 
down said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co any 
dollar slide would be the most dangerous prospect for financial 
markets because of the heavy holdings by foreign investors of 
dollarbased assets 
the treasury official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
treasury secretary nicholas brady was in close consultation 
throughout the weekend with officials at the federal reserve and 
the securities and exchange commission and officials from other 
governments 
brady who chaired a commission which investigated the 508point 
market drop two years ago emphasized the need for the various 
agencies to keep all sides informed on what everyone was doing and 
avoid any hint of panic officials said 
thus at the opening of the market on monday when stock prices 
were still falling bush told reporters i am not worried and 
stressed that government agencies were keeping close tabs on 
developments 
fed chairman alan greenspan who won plaudits for his handling 
of the 1987 crash gained more kudos for the latest episode over 
the weekend the fed made it clear that it would flood the banking 
system with as much cash as needed to make it easier for banks to 
continue making loans to brokerage houses that may have suffered 
heavy losses 
without the line of easy credit brokerage firms could have been 
forced to sell more stocks to replenish their cash supplies thus 
further depressing stock prices 
sec chairman richard breeden who has been in office less than 
week said the safeguards installed after the october 1987 market 
crash worked well on monday demonstrating the significant 
improvements that have been made in trading systems over the past 
two years 
but some in congress were unconvinced saying that the market 
gyrations demonstrated the need for more government regulation of 
securities trading 
senate banking committee chairman donald riegle dmich said 
his panel would call brady to testify on oct 26 about what further 
reforms were needed to dampen market volatility 
rep edward markey dmass said he believed a super 
regulator was needed to oversee the markets one of the 
recommendations not implemented from the brady commission report 
regardless of the triggering mechanism it pretty much falls 
in the same pattern he said there is an incident which 
creates some shortterm volatility at which point computerdriven 
program trading kicks in which adds velocity to the marketplace 
which creates a second level of volatility panic

the agriculture department will be forced to 
furlough some chicken inspectors and reduce loan services to 
farmers if congress fails to cancel spending cuts ordered by the 
grammrudman balanced budget law 
the law triggered on monday orders spending cuts totaling 16 
billion in the 1990 fiscal year that began on oct 1 
dennis kaplan chief of usdas budget control and analysis 
division said there is widespread belief congress will pass some 
kind of reconciliation measure soon that will make the 
grammrudman mandatory cuts or sequester unnecessary 
meanwhile he said in an interview the departments programs 
are going to go on basically as they always have over the next 
couple of weeks therell be no real impact on programs during 
that time 
even if we go through the sequester youre not going to see 
any major impact until toward the end of the year kaplan said 
some usda agencies with big payrolls would be hit hard 
eventually the food safety and inspection service for example 
which handles federal meat and poultry inspection will probably 
furlough a lot of their employees he said but that wont 
occur until august or september 
other agencies in a similar boat include the forest service 
with its vast organization of regional and lowerechelon offices 
the farmers home administration including county offices that 
service loans for financially pressed farmers and the animal and 
plant health inspection service including its quarantine and 
diseasecontrol activities 
kaplan said much of usdas spending is exempted from 
grammrudman cuts including the vast food stamp school lunch and 
other child nutrition programs 
farm price support operations are subject to the grammrudman 
cutback which averages 53 percent for domestic agencies or about 
81 billion defense cuts also must total 81 billion or 43 
percent 
after deducting all the exempted programs from usdas projected 
spending for the 1990 fiscal year that began oct 1 the base used 
for the cuts is about 959 billion kaplan said the 53 percent 
grammrudman reduction would amount to around 509 million 
in addition a large bloc of price support spending by the 
departments commodity credit corp for 1990 crops will actually be 
made in fiscal 1991 however kaplan said that under grammrudman 
rules this ccc expenditure will be counted as part of the 1990 
cutback 
thus the total grammrudman sequester will be nearly 12 
billion including the ccc reductions which will carry into 1991 
two years ago in another grammrudman round that was later 
rolled back by congress usda underwent an 85 percent pruning of a 
base exceeding 825 billion meaning a reduction of around 702 
million 
one of the first significant impacts on farm programs would 
affect dairy farmers 
under the dairy price support program the departments 
commodity credit corp buys cheese butter and nonfat dry milk to 
support the price of milk paid to farmers by dealers these 
purchase prices will be reduced if grammrudman remains in effect 
although the usda has not decided by how much 
kaplan said decisions on how to apply grammrudman cuts to crop 
price support programs including target prices are still a long 
way off 
another factor in the operation of usda agencies will be 
scheduled pay raises of 36 percent that will have to be absorbed 
he said all told those raises will cost the department about 148 
million 
for example the food safety and inspection service will have a 
grammrudman spending cut of about 22 million the agencys pay 
raises in january will cost around 15 million 
if congress appropriates about the same amount as for 198889 
that means the agency will have to come up with about 37 million 
out of the same total budget that it had the previous year in order 
to meet grammrudman and pay raise requirements 
kaplan said the 37 million will be equal to nearly 9 percent of 
the agencys spending budget planned for this fiscal year in 
effect a 9 percent cutback instead of only a 53 percent 
reduction and that would chew into services the agency is expected 
to provide

gold prices were mixed in sluggish trading 
dealers said the dollar traded in a narrow range before dropping 
on news that the us trade deficit widened in august to 1077 
billion traders had expected a deficit around 95 billion

american goods less competitive in foreign markets and making 
foreign goods cheaper in the united states 
dealers said the dollar perked up after the release of slightly 
betterthanexpected us industrial production and capacity 
utilization figures 
it shows that even a bad figure cant depress the market for 
there is enough interest in buying the dollar when its cheap 
said one dealer at a us bank in frankfurt

over the rest of the week because the market is still nervous 
about volatility in us stock prices

futures prices for soybeans and corn climbed 
while wheat prices mostly steadied at the close tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade 
the main story was soybeans where there were strong rumors 
that the soviets are in the market for beans and meal and a fairly 
large quantity said ted mao a grains analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
soybeans contracts for delivery this winter gained 10 cents 
during the session 
steve freed an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc also 
attributed the increase in soybean prices to rain in harvest areas 
of central states 
corn was supported by chinas purchase of corn mao said 
traders were talking about the possibility that the chinese 
could be buying as much as 500000 metric tons they purchased 
150000 metric tons of corn on monday 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 409 a bushel corn was to

the sale of a winery in spain 
in the latest quarter operating profit in the soft drink

increase to 155 billion 
excluding the loss on the winery sales and the impact of recent 
acquisitions and sales in the domestic soft drink business

improvement in domestic operating margins and higher prices 
offset a decline in international results that reflected 
acceleration of concentrate shipments and higher marketing spending

operating earnings jumped 33 percent to 622 million at pizza 
hut and 50 percent to 405 million at taco bell but fell 4 
percent to 364 million at kentucky fried chicken where a strong 
international performance was offset by a decline in domestic 
operations due to lower customer counts higher labor costs and 
higher chicken prices 
for the first nine months of the fiscal year pepsico said it 
earned 6993 million or 264 a share up 217 percent from 
5745 million or 218 a share a year ago 
ninemonth revenue rose 228 percent to 1045 billion from 
851 billion a year earlier

bottling operation once held for sale while the 1988 results 
reflected an aftertax charge of 163 million for reorganizing 
domestic soft drink operations and the winery loss

the latest world stock market turmoil might cramp 
the european trend toward usstyle leveraged buyouts and 
junkbond financing which already is threatened by high interest 
rates and economic worries experts said tuesday 
wall streets nearrecord friday the 13th plunge and subsequent 
gyrations in stock markets worldwide was sparked by the failure of 
a managementemployee group to get financing for its planned 675 
billion buyout of united airlines 
nervousness about further market volatility might make it harder 
for european bidders to raise funds for debtfinanced deals 
wouldbe buyers also are likely to scrutinize the profitability and 
breakup value of their targets much more closely the experts said 
market gyrations also could exacerbate antibuyout antijunk 
bond sentiment in europe where there is widespread ambivalence 
about the import of these american takeover techniques 
human nature being what it is when there a fright in the 
market people immediately begin to question whether they ought to 
be doing what theyre doing said bruce classon managing 
director of corporate finance at bankers trust co in london 
european banks and even american banks will be more cautious 
than in the past said roger brooke chief executive of candover 
investments a londonbased buyout firm 
big highly leveraged deals are raising controversy 
anglofrench financier sir james goldsmiths 21 billion 
allsecurities bid for the british conglomerate bat industries plc 
has prompted a storm of protests in britain 
in a leveraged buyout or lbo a bidder borrows funds to take 
over a company then uses that companys profits or sells its 
assets to pay off the debt 
such deals frequently are financed with the highyield 
highrisk debt securities called junk bonds junk bonds are so 
named because of their low credit ratings which means they have a 
considered to have greater default risk than higherrated bonds 
a slowdown in such deals could further deflate the london stock 
market which recently has gotten some support from takeover 
speculation 
cheaper share prices resulting from the market downturn could 
spur cash buyout bids although not to the extent seen after the 
october 1987 stock market crash experts said 
investors and bankers are looking at economic prospects more 
cautiously around the world said guy dawson head of corporate 
finance at morgan grenfell group plc 
you will see a slowdown in the market dawson said either 
you will see fewer buyouts or they will be done at lower prices 
but he added i dont think it spells the end of the lbo 
market at all 
bidders turned their attention to london and the rest of europe 
as a potential lbo market because competition among buyout houses 
in the united states has reduced yields of such deals there 
but higher interest rates in europe have been making it more 
expensive to finance buyouts in britain europes biggest takeover 
market interest rates are 15 percent an eightyear high partly 
due to government attempts to curb inflation 
also working against lbos are concerns about corporate 
profitability in a climate of slowing economic growth and higher 
inflation particularly in britain 
critics say companies with heavy debts can go bust when interest 
rates rise and also have less leeway to spend money on research and 
development 
europeans also are biased against buyouts because they fear they 
will cause job losses worsening the continents relatively high 
unemployment 
matthias graeper a consultant in the hamburg office of the 
british buyout firm schroder ventures manager ltd said there 
are some bad feelings about junk bonds and the purchase prices of 
some companies in the united states but i think we can avoid the 
mistakes in germany

nervousness about wall streets behavior persisted 
frankfurt which suffered a record drop monday saw big gains in 
urgent buying market indexes also finished higher in paris

the upward and downward moves were much less dramatic than 
mondays gyrations which followed wall streets friday the 13th 
slump 
trading disruptions continued in europe tuesday the brussels 
exchange had computer problems for a second day preventing 
significant trading since friday 
once the confidence of the small investors has been hurt it

earlier in tokyo tuesday the nikkei index closed 52739 points 
or 13 percent higher at 3499608 recouping most of the 18 
percent lost on monday

points from a session high of 21823 in the first 15 minutes of 
official dealings to a low of 21208 in the last 40 minutes of 
trading 
but that was less dramatic than monday when the london index 
fell more than 200 points and then mostly recovered to finish with 
a 705 point decline 
dealers said london was buffeted throughout the session by 
crosscurrents from wall street and fears about the us trade 
figures 
our market is behaving like a puppet on a string said a 
senior dealer at barclays de zoete wedd ltd all markets are and 
wall street is controlling the strings 
the dow jones industrial average was down 2787 points or 1 
percent at 262951 at about the time london closed 
the dow jones industrial average bounced back 88 points monday 
after its 190point plunge on friday 
everyone is still very nervous about the down side said a 
dealer with the london investment firm ubs phillips and drew 
also buyers who passed up bargains monday decided to hold off 
today to see if theyd come back later in the week 
the german stock index dax which had plunged 128 percent in 
its worst oneday drop ever monday soared 8972 points or 64 
percent to 147544 
frankfurts trading volume even surpassed mondays frenzied pace 
as small retail investors rushed to buy back some of the stocks 
they had dumped and institutional funds exploited lower prices to 
boost their holdings 
but the early enthusiasm soon gave way to a more sober 
assessment and profittaking late in the session which was 
extended by one hour to process all the orders 
the madrid stock markets general index rose 596 points or 2 
percent to a close at 31118 the index fell 65 percent monday

wildest sessions on wall street since the october 1987 market crash 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 1865 points 
to 263873 after spiking down as much as 63 points around 1130 
am broader market indicators also fell 
the dow average had plummeted 19058 points on friday and 
bounced back with an 8812point gain on monday leaving investors 
groping for stable ground 
the commerce department handed the market some bad news today 
with its report that the merchandise trade deficit rose nearly 31 
percent in august to 1077 billion from a revised july deficit of 
824 billion 
but analysts did not all agree that the big trade deficit was a 
major factor in todays stock decline some noted that bonds and 
the dollar which are most sensitive to bad trade figures held 
up relatively well 
the dollar recovered after a sharp drop that followed the trade 
report while bonds were mixed an indication that investors were 
not seriously worried about worsening inflation and higher interest 
rates 
the federal reserve injected another 15 billion into the 
banking system today after adding 2 billion in reserves on monday 
banks will be able to use the new reserves to make loans 
including coming to the assistance of brokerage firms caught in a 
cash squeeze because of the drop in stock prices 
the fed adds reserves by repurchasing treasury securities from 
the banks and that puts fresh cash in the banks hands 
stocks remain somewhat unstable after the drastic moves of the 
past two sessions some analysts said 
theres much more going on in the stock market at the moment 
than the trade numbers said lawrence a veit international 
economist at brown brothers harriman amp co 
youll tend to see somewhat accentuated volatility this week 
and next said giulio martini economist at sanford c bernstein 
amp co 
mondays gain was concentrated in bluechip stocks which 
benefited from a flight to quality by nervous investors it 
came on trading volume of 41629 million shares the heaviest ever 
except for the week of the 1987 market crash the indexs gain was 
the fourthbiggest point gain although it was not among the 
biggest percentage gainers 
many economists had expected the latest trade deficit to be 
about 9 billion and veit said he believed the sharp rise could 
turn out to be a statistical freak 
traders were worried about the outlook for the 
employeemanagement buyout proposal for ual corp the stock fell 
another 2567 a share to 19725 after tumbling about 57 a share 
monday and that contributed to the overall market weakness 
in the overall new york stock exchange today declining issues 
outpaced advances by almost 3 to 2 volume on the new york stock 
exchange totaled a heavierthanusual 22407 million shares with 
the heaviest action in the early going 
stocks rallied in tokyo in response to wall streets strength of 
monday but londons market lost ground in sympathy with todays 
weakness on the new york stock exchange 
in tokyo where tuesday trading ended before new york opened for 
business the nikkei stock average jumped by 52739 points or 15 
percent to 3499608 today the gain was the second biggest on the 
japanese market this year and erased most of mondays 64733point 
decline 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index 
fell 279 points or more than 1 percent to close at 21355 
in new york on monday declining issues outnumbered advancing 
ones by a 54 margin on the new york stock exchange indexes of the 
american stock exchange and overthecounter stocks fell while the 
new york stock exchange composite index and wilshire equity index 
rose 
fridays 190point drop had raised fears of a repeat of october 
1987 when a friday decline turned into an oct 19 monday rout 
that knocked a record 508 points off the average that did not turn 
out to be the case this time 
traders said the stock market benefited monday from the 
experience gained in the 1987 crash the new york stock exchange 
managed to handle the heavy trading volume because of a big 
investment in technology made after the crash 
in addition traders were soothed by a promise over the weekend 
by the federal reserve to supply fresh money to the financial 
system if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing to 
traders who lost money

the dollar recovered from an early loss tuesday 
and finished mixed in us trading after falling against most major 
currencies in trading in europe on news of a biggerthanexpected 
us trade deficit 
gold prices edged higher in new york after a mixed showing 
overseas republic national bank of new york quoted a late bid for 
gold of 36640 a troy ounce up 60 cents from mondays late bid 
the dollar dropped early in the day on news that the us trade 
deficit widened in august to 1077 billion when many traders were 
expecting a deficit of about 95 billion 
a rising deficit suggests the dollar is too expensive making 
american goods less competitive in foreign markets and making 
foreign goods cheaper in the united states 
but graham broyd vice president in the foreign exchange 
department at manufacturers hanover trust co said the dollar 
bounced back fairly quickly as traders focused for another day on 
price movements in the us stock market 
from that point on the dollar tracked movements of the stock 
market he said 
the dollar fell as the dow jones industrial average dipped about 
60 points early in the day but then the currency recovered to 
finish above the closing levels reached earlier in europe as the 
dow jones average retraced lost ground the dow jones average 
finished with a loss of about 19 points 
one reason for the interaction between the two markets is that 
the federal reserve may encourage lower interest rates if the stock 
market were to come anywhere near fridays 19058point decline in 
the dow jones industrial average falling interest rates would make 
the dollar less attractive to foreign investors 
but broyd said another reason is that many currency traders view 
the us stock markets recent volatility as more of a us than a 
worldwide problem the volatility has been blamed by many 
strategists on excessive borrowing for corporate takeovers 
as a result broyd said currency traders feel a us stock 
market crash would hurt the dollar more than it would other 
currencies

monday settled 50 point lower at 344 points tuesday each point

that the soviets are in the market for beans and meal and a fairly 
large quanity said ted mao a grains analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
soybeans contracts for delivery this winter had gained as much 
as 10 cents just before the closing bell then slipped 
steve freed a chicagobased analyst with dean witter reynolds

moved higher 
frozen pork bellies led the way with prices settling as high as 
190 points or 190 cents above mondays close 
the market ignored lower cash prices said phil stanley of 
dec futures inc traders just believe demand will remain good for 
pork and this remains a strong psychological factor 
meanwhile packing company interest at higher prices supported 
cattle futures he said 
cattle settled cent32 to 93 cent higher with the contract for 
delivery in october at 7367 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 
cent to 47 cent higher with october at 8310 cents a pound live

the us treasury bond market ended lower in 
brisk choppy trading tuesday as investors moved in step with an 
unsteady stock market 
market analysts said bonds relinquished earlier gains as prices 
of stocks started to improve 
those that had bought are now giving up the hope that the 
stock market will continue to tumble and that the flight to quality 
into bonds will continue said jay goldinger a principal at the 
beverly hills calif investment firm capital insight inc 
the closely watched dow jones industrial average closed down 
1865 points at 263873 tuesday after losing as much as 63 points 
in latemorning trading analysts said the credit markets generally 
shrugged off a government report that the merchandise trade deficit 
rose in august to 1077 billion from a revised july gap of 824 
billion the government also said industrial production edged down 
01 percent in september 
both reports initially were intepreted by the credit markets to 
mean that the economy was sluggish and interest rates had room to 
decline 
but as robert a brusca chief financial economist with nikko 
securities co international explained the market was not at 
all behaving to fundamentals 
the credit markets also showed little reaction to news that the 
federal reserve injected another 15 billion into the banking 
system tuesday after adding 2 billion in reserves on monday 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds the bellwether 
30year issue fell about point or 625 per 1000 face amount

inversely from its price jumped to 803 percent from 797 percent 
the closely watched issue had fallen around 1750 on monday 
wiping out nearly all of the huge gains from fridays rally 
prices of shortterm government issues were off around 132 
point intermediate maturities fell between point and 516 point 
and longterm issues lost around point according to figures 
provided by telerate inc a financialinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer stood at 118658 down 257

the 31 percent increase in the nations trade 
deficit in august means americans dug themselves deeper into debt 
with the rest of the world 
the trade deficit is the imbalance between what americans buy 
from overseas and what they ship to foreign customers it rose in 
august because exports declined a slight 02 percent while imports 
jumped by 64 percent 
the imbalance threatens jobs because it means consumers are 
buying products made abroad instead of ones made by american 
workers 
nations that run trade surpluses with the united states are 
accumulating piles of dollars that they use to buy us stocks 
bonds factories and real estate

integrated resources inc said tuesday it had 
abandoned talks to sell core financial businesses to an 
unidentified buyer and raised its estimate of secondquarter losses 
above the previously announced 600 million 
but integrated said a group of senior executive officers had 
advised the firm that it intends to make a proposal to buy three of 
the five principal financial businesses 
the struggling investment concern which defaulted on debt 
payments in june had been negotiating to sell key assets to raise 
money to pay some of its 175 billion in outstanding debt and 
avoid a bankruptcy filing 
the annoucements tuesday sent integrated stock falling 25 cents 
to 125 on the new york stock exchange integrated was trading 
around 16 a share in may 
integrateds principal financial businesses are integrated 
resources equity corp of englewood colo its principal 
brokerdealer subsidiary resources trust co and integrated 
resources asset management corp an investment adviser 
the firm also is seeking to sell two of its life insurance 
companies integrated resources life insurance co of des moines 
iowa and capitol life insurance co of denver 
if we can arrange the sale of these three core companies we 
feel that we will be in a stronger position to sell integrated 
resources life insurance co and maximize its value integrated 
chairman stephen weinroth said in a statement 
accordingly we feel that this proposal should be considered 
in order to further our overall restructuring plan he said 
integrated said last week it was negotating with an unidentified 
third party for the sale of the five principal financial companies 
after a 310 million deal with whitehall financial group fell 
through 
privately held whitehall said it could not obtain financing for 
the planned 310 million transaction citing worsening conditions 
in the nations debt financing markets and concerns over the value 
of the businesses 
integrated has not paid any principal or interest to bondholders 
since june when it said it would have to default because of 
worsening troubles stemming from its difficulty in diversifying out 
of real estate into financial services 
integrated said its previously announced estimate of 600 
million in secondquarter losses after taxes was based partly on 
the planned sale of its core financial businesses 
the firm said it expects to report a higher loss because of 
the change in its expectations as to the proceeds from a sale of 
the core businesses as well as other events which have occurred 
subsequent to integrateds previous announcement

china has bought additional us wheat under a 
price subsidy program the agriculture department said tuesday 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said three private exporting 
companies made the deals for a total of 300000 metric tons under 
the departments export enhancement program or eep 
dickerson said the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized 
china under eep last feb 27 
with the latest eep approvals china has 340000 tons remaining 
to be used under the current authorization 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the latest sales would be about 11 million bushels at 
current prices estimated by usda at 385 per bushel the wheat 
would have a farm value of around 42 milion 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged 1281 per ton or 
about 35 cents per bushel 
the subsidized sales were handled by the peavey co 210000 
tons cargill inc 50000 and bunge corp 40000 
with the latest sales china has bought about 43 million tons 
of us wheat for delivery in the 198990 marketing year that began 
on june 1 most of it without subsidies in 198889 china bought 
more than 8 million tons of us wheat all of it under the eep 
program

the rules of the mergers game may be changing 
but it was clear tuesday theres no shortage of players even if 
there is turmoil on wall street 
while ual corp executives were trying to appease big banks and 
salvage a planned buyout of the parent of united airlines a much 
smaller carrier mesa airlines inc received a takeover bid from 
stateswest airlines inc 
stateswest like mesa a small regional carrier declined to 
reveal the terms but coming as the stock market continued to 
fluctuate the dow jones industrial average closed down more than 
18 points after seesawing throughout tuesdays session the offer 
showed theres still confidence in the takeover business 
in the ual deal the managementled investor group seeking to 
buy the airline restructured its offer and lowered its price to 
562 billion from 675 billion trying to persuade japanese banks 
to help finance the takeover 
news that banks would not back the deal contributed to the stock 
markets tremendous slide on friday when the dow jones average 
plunged 190 points it also raised concerns that takeovers had 
skidded to a halt 
on monday one possible takeover bid became a casualty of the 
market volatility as developer donald trump withdrew his 75 
billion proposed offer for amr inc the parent of american 
airlines 
andrew geller who follows amr for provident national bank in 
philadephia said the snag in the ual offer probably helped trump 
decide to shelve his proposal 
observers said the takeover business would survive the ual 
problems and the tumult on wall street but billiondollar buyouts 
were expected to be more difficult to accomplish and prospective 
deals were likely to undergo the same kind of scrutiny as the ual 
offer 
bankers have become cautious because companies such as campeau 
corp and resorts international inc have been unable to make the 
interest payments following takeovers 
campeau for example ran into trouble because its federated 
department stores inc and allied stores corp units did not have 
the kind of sales that chairman robert campeau anticipated when he 
went heavily into debt to buy the two retailers 
without those sales campeau did not have enough cash to pay his 
bills 
bankers want to ensure that a company will be able to handle the 
heavy debt load undertaken in a buyout and are looking at a 
certain kind of credit risk geller said 
uals bankers are concerned about a falloff in air travel if 
united does less business it would not have the cash needed to 
service its debt and its assets particularly its fleet of 
airplanes would be worth less because of the reduced demand 
by lowering its price the group seeking ual is lowering the 
payments it would have to make after the buyout and thereby easing 
its cash flow requirements 
while all deals will be examined closely some prospective 
buyers will have an easier time than others 
for instance analysts say if kohlbergkravis roberts amp co were 
presenting its 2453 billion bid for rjr nabisco inc before banks 
today it likely would win approval for its proposal faster than if 
it were buying an airline like united 
the reason is that rjr nabisco has a business that is considered 
recession proof even if consumers become cautious theyll 
still buy the food and tobacco companys products and its cash flow 
would likely be steady 
put another way consumers might forgo expensive vacations and 
put a crimp in an airlines cash flow but they would not stop 
buying oreo cookies or camel filters

boeing co must offer more to settle a twoweek 
strike by production workers than it would have cost to win 
contract approval before the walkout a union leader said tuesday 
a halt in other labor negotiations with boeing also shows the 
worlds largest commercial airplane builder isnt going to get 
serious with any other group until they settle with us said tom 
baker president of district lodge 751 of the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers 
discounting the likelihood of a quick settlement from 
negotiations that resume wednesday baker said voting down a second 
contract offer could leave both sides even more entrenched and 
farther apart 
thats why we on this side of the table have to be so 
cautious about taking anything back to the membership that could 
possibly be rejected he said 
of the 57800 boeing workers represented by the machinists 
43300 in the puget sound area are covered by the district lodge 
while 12000 other machinists are in wichita kan 1700 in 
portland ore and a few hundred at scattered sites in california 
utah hawaii montana and other states 
amid growing reports of airline concern over delivery delays 
talks were set to resume wednesday afternoon in the office of 
federal mediator douglas hammond who called the two sides together 
for the first talks since oct 2 
the strike began oct 4 after an 85 percent vote to walk out 
rather than accept a threeyear contract with wage increases of 4 
percent the first year 3 percent the second and 3 percent the 
third bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 
percent the second costofliving boosts virtually matching 
inflation and higher benefits 
the money package is first we have to improve that money 
package everything else is second baker said 
to end the strike boeing must offer more money than would have 
been required to win approval oct 3 and further ease the number of 
overtime hours workers must put in as well as make concessions in 
other areas he said he declined to be more specific 
the rejected offer would have reduced mandatory overtime from 
200 hours a quarter to 160 hours as strikers spend more time with 
their families that has become a real hot issue baker said 
boeing contends it needs the overtime work to keep up with a 
huge backlog of jet orders 
boeing spokesman harold carr refused to say whether the 
companys negotiators would have a new offer wednesday 
if the company doesnt have a better offer then these talks 
are kind of futile said jack daniels communications director 
for district lodge 751 
members of the united aerospace workers local 1069 representing 
about 3200 production and maintenance workers at boeing 
helicopters near philadelphia voted sunday to approve an 
indefinite extension of their contract which previously was 
extended 10 days 
carr said tuesday the issues there were similar to those for the 
machinists theyll wait now until the iam settles id expect 
he said 
boeing negotiators walked out monday in the first day of 
negotiations with the companys secondlargest union the seattle 
professional engineering employees association citing grossly 
excessive pay demands 
those talks which cover 28000 engineers and technical support 
workers about 95 percent in the puget sound area will resume next 
monday at the request of a federal mediator said dan mahoney 
general counsel to the unaffiliated union the associations 
contract expires dec 1 
boeing delivered two aircraft monday a 767 to lauda air of 
austria and a 757 to united airlines bringing to seven the number 
of jets delivered during the walkout 
dick shimizu of america west airlines said the arizonabased 
carrier was told a 757 it was expecting thursday wouldnt be 
delivered until nov 7 delaying the the start of four daily routes 
out of houston from nov 6 to jan 12 but a 737 scheduled for 
delivery in december should be on time

the us merchandise trade deficit widened to 
1077 billion in august as imports flooded in at a record pace 
the government said tuesday in a dose of bad news that didnt help 
a skittish stock market 
the federal reserve board moved for the second straight day to 
soothe investors worries pumping 15 billion into the banking 
system a day after making a 2 billion cash infusion 
the money is intended to calm jittery markets by showing the 
feds resolve to make sure banks have enough reserves to keep loans 
flowing to brokerage houses caught in a cash squeeze because of 
falling stock prices 
the commerce department said the august trade shortfall between 
imports and exports was the largest imbalance in eight months and 
was 31 percent bigger than a revised july deficit of 824 billion 
at the white house the bush administration expressed 
disappointment in the trade report 
this is of course an unwelcome increase and were hopeful 
that it simply is a onemonth situation and will turn arond 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
asked if the administration feared that the trade numbers would 
drive the market down fitzwater said the market seems stable 
and the economy is sound and there is no cause for disruption of 
that kind 
the market did retreat significantly in the hours after the 
trade deficit announcement dropping by more than 60 points at one 
time but the market rallied with the dow jones industrial average 
finishing the day down 1865 points 
tuesdays performance followed a gain of 8812 points monday and 
a plunge of 190 points friday 
analysts said that the surprisingly bad trade figure was just 
one of several reasons for the markets gyrations tuesday another 
factor cited was the continued uncertainty over the proposed buyout 
of ual corp the parent company of united airlines 
the sharply higher trade deficit for august also captured the 
attention of democrats in congress unhappy with the bush 
administrations trade policies 
house majority leader richard a gephardt of missouri said the 
august deficit showed a continued erosion of our economic 
strength its time that this administration recognize the 
battle we face in trade 
private analysts said they feared that the worsening trade 
deficit signaled a return to much higher imbalances which would 
act to dampen domestic growth in coming months 
the last time we had sharply higher trade deficits in 1986 it 
almost brought the economy to its knees and the economy had a great 
deal more steam behind it than it does now said david jones an 
economist at aubrey g lanston amp co 
the august imbalance resulted from a 02 percent decline in 
exports which fell to 304 billion and a 64 percent increase in 
imports which rose to a record 412 billion the trade deficit is 
the difference between imports and exports 
economists blamed the record imports on the strength of the us 
dollar through much of this year a stronger dollar makes foreign 
goods cheaper for american consumers while making us exports more 
expensive on overseas markets 
clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more 
attractive said william t archey a trade expert at the us 
chamber of commerce 
through the first eight months of this year the us trade 
deficit was running at an annual rate of 1097 billion down 
slightly from a 1988 deficit of 1185 billion the 74 percent 
improvement compares to a 22 percent decline in the deficit for all 
of 1988 a year when a narrowing trade gap contributed almost half 
of the total growth in the economy 
analysts are worried that if the trade performance deteriorates 
too much in coming months it could seriously jeopardize economic 
prospects for next year 
in a further sign of a slowing economy the government also 
reported tuesday that industrial production dipped 01 percent in 
september the first decline in six months as the output at 
factories making both durable and nondurable goods fell 
the 1077 billion august trade deficit was the first increase 
in the deficit since may and was the biggest imbalance since a 
108 billion december deficit 
the nations foreign oil bill increased 04 percent to 43 
billion in august as an increase in volume was partially offset by 
a fall in price 
the amount of imported oil rose to 867 million barrels a day 
from 814 million in july but the average price per barrel fell to 
1614 from 1712 
as usual the largest trade deficit in august was with japan an 
imbalance of 399 billion down from 4 billion in july the 
deficit was 14 billion with taiwan 12 billion with canada 
700 million with south korea and 600 million with china
