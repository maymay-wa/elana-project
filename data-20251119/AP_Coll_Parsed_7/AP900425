security zones where the demobilization is to take place 
israel galeano a top rebel chief and 12 other contra

roman catholic bishop leo t maher who drew 
widespread attention when he banned a prochoice political 
candidate from receiving communion last year underwent surgery to 
remove a brain tumor wednesday 
maher 74 was in serious condition after the 2hour operation 
at scripps clinic in la jolla doctors said they were optimistic he 
would recover from the surgery but expressed concern about a 
recurrence of the lifethreatening tumor 
dr thomas waltz who led the operating team said doctors 
removed 75 percent to 80 percent of the tumor which was about 3 
inches in diameter and located in the back right portion of the 
brain 
its a tumor that you really cant classify as either 
malignant or benign waltz said it doesnt spread to other 
parts of the body but it can recur 
he said the tumors possible recurrence can be suppressed by 
radiation therapy 
maher checked into the clinic monday after his physician became 
concerned over his condition the diocese of san diego said in a 
statement tests then revealed the brain lesion and the surgery was 
scheduled said sue pondrom a spokeswoman for scripps clinic 
in the past several weeks the diocese said maher has grown 
increasingly aware of a lack of physical strength and at times has 
demonstrated a loss of equilibrium 
at midday pondrom confirmed that the operation had been 
completed but said no information on the bishops condition would 
be released until later in the day 
scores of catholics started a prayer vigil for the bishop on 
tuesday 
under diocesan law maher must retire as head of the 
460000member diocese by his 75th birthday july 1 
he has held the position since 1969 his tenure has been marked 
by great growth in the diocese as well as by controversy most 
recently he last fall banned lucy killea then an assemblywoman 
running for state senate from receiving communion because of her 
outspoken views in favor of abortion rights 
the sanction and its implications on the abortion issue and the 
separation of church and state became focal points for voters who 
elected killea a democrat over republican carol bentley 
bentley a prolife candidate blamed mahers intervention and 
the subsequent national publicity killea received for her loss in 
the republicandominated district

some wellesley college students have 
inadvertently hit a feminist sore spot by protesting barbara bushs 
selection as commencement speaker 
the students gained headlines by circulating a petition saying 
to honor barbara bush as a commencement speaker is to honor a 
woman who has gained recognition through the achievements of her 
husband which contradicts what we have been taught over our years 
at wellesley 
the petition was signed by 150 of the 2200 students at the 
elite womens school 
but defense of the first lady percolated slowly and then poured 
forth even from some of the most liberal corners of the boston 
area 
what seems to have happened here is that the feminist 
standards of the 90s are being applied to a woman who matured in 
another era wrote boston globe columnist david nyhan who is no 
bush fan barbara bush is a woman of exemplary values vast charm 
and unrivaled popularity to list those traits in descending 
order 
the flap has stirred the tranquil college campus nestled in a 
corner of this posh boston suburb where the cost of tuition room 
and board runs to about 18000 a year 
students involved with the petition have become a little 
publicity shy in the wake of the criticism according to the senior 
class dean 
in another globe article suzanne gordon a freelance writer and 
feminist who has a book due out in january called prisoner of 
mens dreams laid out her argument against the students 
gordon wrote that the petition made me mad enough even as a 
longtime feminist to speak out against what has become an 
increasingly popular rendition of feminist thinking 
what the wellesley protesters have inadvertently revealed is 
how much the original goals of the womens movement have been 
distorted by the maleclone careerism of todays dress for 
success feminists she said 
susie cardenas a senior who helped push the petition did not 
return several messages to her dorm telephone 
lorraine garnett ward dean for the 600member class of 1990 
defended the petitioners although she pointed out they do not 
represent a majority of senior class 
wellesley college students are extremely thoughtful people who 
are not at all whiney ward said i think this is a college 
which encourages young women to think and think aloud 
feminist author betty friedan said she had no problem with the 
choices mrs bush made in her life but added the first lady should 
use her influence to help other women 
the choice to marry and the opportunity to exert influence as 
first lady is to be envied but it is also to be used said 
friedan who teaches at the university of southern california 
what i would do is say we challenge you to take a leading role 
in demanding that this nation take a leading role on child care 
a spokeswoman for eleanor smeal former president of the 
national organization for women who now heads the virginiabased 
group the feminist majority treaded a careful line when talking 
about mrs bush 
our impression is that if for instance it was an eleanor 
roosevelt who was someone who really used her role to improve the 
status of women this probably wouldnt be happening said tamar 
raphael after speaking with smeal we know barbara bush is 
really for womens rights but she really hasnt used her position 
yet to do that 
several students said the timing of the protest made them uneasy 
im primarily a little embarrassed just because i feel we 
invited her and its a slap in the face said erica herz a 
senior there are a lot of people who are happy shes coming 
marcy goldstein a junior said it would be wonderful to have 
such a wellknown person on campus 
mrs bush still plans to attend the june 1 graduation 
ceremonies according to her press office

poachers have killed a rhinoceros seen by 
nearly every visitor to a game reserve where she had claimed a 
domain for herself and a male calf 
richard leakey the director of state wildlife management 
service said investigations were underway in the southwestern 
masai mara game reserve on the death of the black rhino nicknamed 
halima 
halima is a common name for women along kenyas indian ocean 
coast 
the animal was killed by unknown person or persons using a 
highpowered rifle said leakey in a statement monday 
leakey deplored what he called senseless killing of a well 
known tourist attraction and said halimas horn had been 
recovered 
halima who left a yearold male orphan calf permanently lived 
in a place called musiala in the game reserve and her defiance of 
migratory habits made it possible for every interested park visitor 
to see her 
rhinos are normally killed for their horn which is then ground 
into a powder that is considered an aphrodisiac in the far east 
the horn is also used to make ornate handles for daggers in persian 
gulf countries 
poachers cashing in on the demand for rhino horns have reduced 
the animals population in the east african nation from 20000 in 
the late 1970s to an estimated 400 at present most of them in 
sanctuaries 
conservationists say the slaughter of wildlife particularly 
elephants and rhinos has been reduced dramatically since leakey 
became kenyas director of wildlife management early 1988

authorities said 
tuesdays slaughter was carried out in the style of the camorra 
a crime syndicate that is a rough equivalent of the sicilian mafia 
said investigating magistrate paolo albano

flourishing illegal drug trade in the area 
the attack occurred in the early hours in the hamlet of 
pescopago about 20 miles north of naples 
the dead included two tanzanians one iranian and one italian 
police said they could not immediately identify the other dead 
among the wounded was the 13yearold son of the coffee bars 
owner 
doctors operating on one of the wounded a 23yearold 
tanzanian found 10 bags filled with heroin in his stomach the 
italian news agency ansa reported 
there are africans who sell drugs here and the massacre is 
either directed towards the africans who are operating on their own 
or towards africans whom the camorra supplies with drugs albano

some people might think that fussing over a name 
is much ado about nothing but those people arent named 
shakespeare 
of those who are about 115 turned up to celebrate the bards 
birthday tuesday at the site of the new globe theater it was the 
largest gathering of shakespeares since 1964 which was celebrated 
as the playwrights 400th birthday all seemed proud of their 
illustrious name 
of course it may be that none of the latterday shakespeares is 
related to englands premier playwright genealogies are hazy on 
this point 
but never mind 
we all like to think were related to the bard said stanley 
shakespeare a london hairdresser who pored through phonebooks for 
six months to compile the invitation list of 600 shakespeares 
throughout britain 
hes not picky invitations went to people named shakespear 
shakspear shaxper and other variations 
those who came to london will be guests of honor at a week of 
readings dinner parties films and concerts organized by the 
friends of shakespeares globe but for most of the shakespeares 
the important thing was being together as a family 
these shakespeares are all fantastic really friendly and we 
all feel a natural empathy with each other even though most of us 
have never met before said 33yearold phil shakespeare a 
supermarket manager in west bromsgrove near stratforduponavon 
the playwrights birthplace 
he munched on a piece of fried chicken and chatted briefly with 
a new acquaintance 35yearold rosamund shakespeare who carried 
10monthold hillary shakespeare on her hip 
ms shakespeare said she kept her maiden name and passed it to 
her daughter because i think it sounds nicer than my husbands 
name kukowski 
besides she added she has always been fascinated by the 
playwright and as a teenager hitchhiked with her brother to 
stratforduponavon arriving long after dark 
we couldnt find a room and slept on the steps of the royal 
shakespeare theater i thought it so ironic that the shakespeares 
couldnt find a bed for the night in stratford 
the next day i put a rose on williams grave she said 
the shakespeares donned yellow hardhats and visited the 
construction site where a replica is being built of the elizabethan 
globe theater the playhouse most closely associated with the bard 
a 30foothigh banner bearing shakespeares portrait was 
unfurled next door on the new midland bank building also under 
construction 
gangs of workers stopped drilling and hammering to listen to a 
few lines from henry v then gordon schwontkowski of cary ill 
told the shakespeares how he handpainted the huge banner at night 
in his high school gym as a donation to the theater project 
the banner will hang at the worksite until the globe opens in 
1993 
last year archaeologists uncovered the original theater about 
300 yards from the new site on the south bank of the thames after 
lunch the shakespeare clan visited the site 
carl shakespeare lingered behind to enter his name in the 
guestbook alongside the signatures of stanley shakespeare beryl 
shakespeare dorothy shakespeare and the rest 
the 25yearold research chemist said he never felt any impulse 
to write although he was capable of turning a pretty phrase 
when i was 13 i wrote a descriptive story about the wind 
which my teacher said was the best she had ever read she read it 
aloud to the class and i must admit it was pretty good said 
shakespeare who paused a moment to reflect 
who knows he said maybe theres a budding shakespeare in 
all of us

when president bush agonizes over a difficult 
choice as hes done this week on the issue of economic sanctions 
against the soviet union he sometimes likes to quote a favorite 
philosopher yogi berra 
i love the old expression of yogi berras you say what 
happened to the mets yogi he said well we made the wrong 
mistakes the president told a group of building contractors on 
tuesday 
bush used the words of the often verbally befuddled baseball 
great to explain his decision at least for the moment not to 
slap a series of economic penalties on the soviet union in response 
to its crackdown in lithuania 
i expect in this job ill make plenty of mistakes but i dont 
want to make the wrong mistakes bush said 
once again the issue of sanctions was presenting a major 
foreign policy dilemma for bush 
just as he resisted imposing sanctions on china last year in the 
aftermath of the bloody tiananmen square massacre the president 
once again finds himself under pressure from conservatives in 
congress to act more decisively 
it was to use another favorite bush berraism deja vu all 
over again 
last summer bush finally imposed a series of noneconomic 
sanctions on the beijing government while saying he did not want 
to go further for fear of hurting the chinese people 
among those sanctions was a ban on highlevel contacts between 
governments however the president then sent national security 
adviser brent scowcroft on a secret mission to express us 
feelings about the use of force against chinas own citizens 
when confronted with the apparent violation of his own 
nocontact edict bush said he did not want to take any steps that 
would isolate china from the community of nations 
he now is making similar arguments for withholding sanctions 
against the soviet union that would show us displeasure with the 
kremlins efforts to block lithuanian independence 
administration sources said bush marched to the brink of 
announcing sanctions on moscow only to back away at least for 
the moment in response to skepticism from us allies in western 
europe over such a course and concern that us sanctions could 
only make matters worse 
explaining his reluctance bush said youve got to look at 
the real options im old enough to remember hungary in 1956 and 
where we exhorted people to go to the barricades and a lot of 
people were left out there all alone 
the president used the same argument recently for explaining why 
his administration would not formally recognize the new government 
of lithuania 
the only sanctions bush said he would consider are economic ones 
and sources say these would deal mainly with withholding trade 
and investment concessions that the united states was otherwise 
prepared to grant moscow 
economic links between the two superpowers right now are slight 
and bush has repeatedly ruled out this governments main economic 
leverage over the soviet union a grain embargo 
the bush administration and the reagan administration before 
it has argued that the trouble with economic sanctions is that 
they rarely work the way they are intended and often wind up 
hurting the wrong people 
bush voiced such an argument over past sanctions against the 
white minority rule government of south africa economic penalties 
now in place were imposed by congress over reaganbush 
administration objections 
more recently the president yielding to congressional 
pressure voiced support for keeping the sanctions in place 
against pretoria even though he disputes their value 
he has said they should remain on at least until more progress 
is made toward a oneperson onevote government 
ironically in central america where us sanctions have taken 
a major toll on national economies bush is having a hard time 
winning congressional support for undoing the impact of those 
sanctions 
vice president dan quayle heads today for the inauguration of 
nicaraguan presidentelect violeta chamorro without the aid bush 
promised her usbacked government and the new government of 
panama 
years of us economic sanctions against the leftist government 
of outgoing nicaraguan president daniel ortega and the panama 
dictatorship of manuel antonio noriega left both countries 
economies hobbled 
the presidents 800 million aid package for the two nations 
remains stalled in congress 
bush invoked the yogi berra wrong mistakes quote twice on 
tuesday after he told it to a group of agricultural writers he 
added youve got to think about that one and i dont want to 
make the wrong mistake

a fledgling ohio politician is coming clean 
less than two weeks before a congressional primary election in 
hopes that voters will like a candidate who tells the truth about 
telling a lie 
ricky lee mattox a democrat who wants to oust republican rep 
donald buz lukens confessed to using a masquerade to get 
lukens to explain the secrets of his past successes 
using another name and posing as a college student researching a 
paper on political strategy mattox asked lukens to map out the 
tactics he used to win election and reelection 
lukens obliged 
although embroiled in the worst political mess of his 
20plusyear career the congressman met with his wouldbe rival at 
a restaurant in middletown ohio in february and described how to 
win in the 8th district 
what he said was i would never tell one of my opponents 
this but mattox said from oxford ohio he confided in me 
tactics about his first and second campaigns that i thought were 
brilliant 
i came out of the meeting with a lot of respect for him the 
28yearold mattox said ive never met anyone with as much 
political knowledge 
lukens said tuesday that he remembered meeting mattox he 
seemed receptive he seemed like a nice guy the incumbent said 
i am a little surprised that ricky would go to that extent 
lukens said if he had just told me he was ricky mattox i would 
have given the same advice 
but would he have gone into the same stepbystep detail 
oh sure replied lukens theres no secret about it 
theres nothing magic the key is timing and application 
lukens then detailed how he goes about working the district 
beginning with tiny farm towns and ending in the cities 
his description matched exactly mattoxs inventory of lukens 
campaign tactics it also matched secondhand accounts of lukens 
own activities as he struggles for his political life while 
uncertain of the outcome of his appeal for a sexrelated 
misdemeanor involving a teenage girl 
lukens has been highly visible in his district making the 
rounds of serviceclub breakfasts farm group meetings and other 
small gatherings 
lukens has steered clear of republican meetings and candidate 
forums since his official stance is that hes waiting for the 10th 
ohio district court of appeals to settle the challenge of his 
conviction for contributing to the unruliness of a minor 
mattox hasnt followed lukens advice 
lukens advocates steering clear of areas where opponents are 
strong and concentrating instead on where the ducks are mattox 
spent a lot of time going doortodoor in hamilton ohio the 
hometown of his chief democratic rival gregory jolivette 
lukens told mattox that a year of advance work was a basic 
requirement mattox launched his campaign three months before the 
may 8 primary 
but that doesnt mean mattox didnt value the deceptively 
gathered strategy if i were running a fullscale campaign i 
would follow the strategy exactly he said 
mattox maintained he had nowhere else to turn as a democratic 
candidate in a district that had sent republicans to congress for a 
generation 
i wasnt receiving any advice from the democratic party 
here he said i wasnt receiving any help 
mattox who has never before sought elective office admitted he 
was going public with his subterfuge out of desperation because his 
campaign has attracted little attention 
while he was in a confessional mood mattox also admitted that 
he has been deliberately misleading about how he has made ends meet 
since his medical discharge from the navy 
the former missile technician routinely describes himself as a 
data base operator for essenza corp 
he now says that is true but not precisely accurate 
mattox actually punches ordering information into the computers 
at essenzas sds pizza near the miami university campus in oxford 
he said the job is parttime temporary and chosen for flexible 
hours during the campaign

already theyre saying its the 
biggest happening in astronomy since galileo put his eye to a 
telescope 
so step right up folks and discover the wonders of the 
universe see how big it is learn its age look at light created 
14 billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant 
ride along to the beginning of everything almost to the big 
bang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago see stars born and see 
them die watch galaxies form follow the flow of gas into the 
milky ways halo peer deep into the universe past so many stars 
in our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetime 
to count to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about 200 
billion stars 
for scientists and then the rest of us all that becomes 
possible now that the space shuttle discovery has carried the 
hubble space telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen 
before the telescope a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck 
has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light 
light speeding along at 186000 miles a second is the 
messenger of creation tracking the trail of light from today to 
the first moments contains all the information we will ever have 
about the creation of the universe 
the hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps to 
the first echoes of creation this is a worldclass event even if 
astronomy is not your thing 
superlatives 
in the history of optical astronomy there have been two great 
leaps in the resolution of the universe galileos telescope in the 
autumn of 1609 and the hubble space telescope in april 1990 
eric j chaisson a senior scientist at the space telescope science 
institute in baltimore 
one more 
no one ever made anything that good james westphal 
california institute of technology 
another 
dr lennard fisk nasas chief scientist predicts that the 
hubble telescope will literally be the dawn of a new era in 
astronomy 
eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance but the hst named 
after edwin powell hubble holds that kind of promise 
hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who 
concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from earth 
but that the farther away they are the faster they move the 
theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the 
universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is 
still rushing from the site of that socalled big bang 
astronomers think the big bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billion 
years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible 
speed and heat eventually matter cooled and condensed into 
galaxies stars and planets 
there are bigger telescopes than the hubble but they are all on 
earth and all subject to a major limitation the atmosphere 
which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through the 
problem of skywatching through layers of air has been likened to 
birdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool 
the voyager spacecraft which sent back astonishing views of 
earths sister planets had to travel 12 years to get close enough 
for pictures as they whizzed past with the hubble says scientist 
edward weiler such pictures are possible any time we want 
the telescope is 425 by 14 feet and consists of a 945inch 
primary mirror that gathers incoming light 
on a clear dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles 
away says weiler chief nasa scientist on the hubble project 
with a 28power telescope you can see it on the moon 250000 
miles away with the hst you could see a firefly in australia from 
washington

home ports under construction in new york 
alabama mississippi texas and washington state are among 34 
military installations the navy is considering for possible closure 
a threepage list of navy recommendations for closure 
realignment and consolidation surfaced tuesday during a hearing by 
two house armed services subcommittees 
the list drew immediate criticism from a lawmaker who released 
the document and a navy statement that it was a preliminary 
compilation and not a hit list 
the pentagon politically wants us to open and close bases at 
the same time said rep patricia schroeder dcolo who opposes 
continued spending on new home ports nationwide 
vice adm stanley r arthur identified the list as candidates 
for closure and realignment drafted by navy officials 
a navy spokesman lt cmdr craig quigley said later that the 
list was an informal document that is part of the early stages of 
the services review of all shore establishments the review is 
expected to be completed by july or august 
appearance of a facility in no way indicates its on some 
hit list quigley said 
lawmakers also reacted angrily in january to defense secretary 
dick cheneys plan to close or scale back 72 domestic bases and 14 
overseas installations 
democrats including rep les aspin of wisconsin chairman of the 
house armed services committee criticized cheneys list as 
partisan for singling out bases in democratic districts 
navy officials appeared before the house armed services seapower 
and military installations subcommittees tuesday to discuss 
strategic home porting under which the navys fleet of 550 
ships are spread among 41 ports 
strategic home porting remains a valid military objective 
because of its beneficial effect on peacetime readiness said 
jacqueline schafer assistant secretary of the navy for 
installations and environment 
she indicated however that the navy is reviewing all its 
installations including the new home ports for possible closure 
and realignments 
according to the list closing the home port on staten island 
ny which is 90 percent complete would cost 142 million and 
result in annual savings of 7 million 
navy spokesman quigley said navy secretary lawrence garrett iii 
met with new york mayor david dinkins and stressed that the service 
plans to base its ships at staten island 
shutting down the facility at everett wash the least 
developed of the home ports would cost 20 million annual savings 
were estimated at 22 million 
the other home ports on the list are in ingleside texas 
mobile ala and pascagoula miss 
among other installations on the list were those at hunters 
point calif and sand point wash a naval air station in 
brunswick maine and a naval supply school in athens ga home 
state of the chairman of the senate armed services committee 
democratic sen sam nunn 
the list also included consolidating 13 facilities including 
two at the naval base at guantanamo bay cuba two in michigan two 
in oregon and three in wisconsin aspins home state 
the navy is considering keeping open six facilities that had 
been included on cheneys list as candidates for closure or 
realignment all are in california including the naval station in 
alameda and the shipyard in long beach 
at tuesdays hearing the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress recommended that the defense 
department withhold additional money for the home port projects due 
to the changing situation worldwide fiscal constraints and the 
unlikely chances of a 600ship naval fleet ever being built 
the gao also estimated that the cost of building and operating 
the new home ports would exceed 1 billion compared with the 
pentagons initial cost estimate of 799 million

a woman unlucky in love found good fortune in 
divorce when a paperwork error delayed her marital split long 
enough for her husband to win the lottery 
on tuesday a state appeals court upheld a judges ruling 
cutting bonita lynch in for 550000 of her exhusbands winnings 
fortune favored husband with a jackpot but because his 
marriage had not ended fortune dealt his wife a share judge 
noel fidel wrote for the threejudge appeals panel though the 
lottery was a windfall spouses marry for better or for worse and 
share no less in windfalls than in labors wages 
ms lynch had been living apart from her husband michael for 
about two years when she testified at an uncontested divorce 
hearing on feb 10 1987 that their marriage was irretrievably 
broken 
she should have gotten her divorce that day but her lawyers had 
given her husband the wrong date for the hearing forcing a delay 
the matter still wasnt final 11 days later when her husband won 
22 milllion in the state lottery 
lynch a computer expert had bought the ticket with donna 
williams a girlfriend he married after the divorce became final 
he died last oct 30 but his widow fought on behalf of his estate 
to keep his first wife from taking a cut 
under tuesdays ruling lynchs widow gets to keep half the 22 
million jackpot because half the ticket was hers to begin with the 
remaining 11 million will be split evenly between lynchs first 
wife and his estate 
in arizona it aint over till its over said bonita 
lynchs attorney kenneth j love borrowing from yogi berra love 
said ms lynch had no comment on the ruling and did not want any 
details about her released 
j douglas mcvay a lawyer for lynchs widow said no decision 
has been made on an appeal 
a call to a phoenixarea listing for donna lynch was not 
immediately returned tuesday 
michael and bonita lynch married in 1968 and separated in 1985 
he began living with donna williams in 1986 bonita lynch filed for 
divorce the same year after lynch won the lottery she filed for a 
share of the winnings 
superior court judge rufus coulter awarded her a share on the 
grounds all assets acquired during a marriage are community 
property 
lynch appealed saying that his will to union with his first 
wife had ended by feb 10 and that it was her lawyers who made the 
mistake 
the appeals panel rejected the arguments saying that the 
paperwork errors were unintentional 
this case displays the hand of chance fidel wrote 
the appeals court also said it was unclear when the will to 
union was really broken because the couple discussed 
reconciliation through much of the separation 
as late as 1987 bonita lynch helped her former husband in a 
medical emergency checked him into an alcoholic rehabilitation 
program and agreed to join him in family counseling the court 
said

after more than 50 years the united states is 
ready to pursue normal diplomatic relations with albania despite 
its reputation as one of the worlds most rigid police states 
the state department responded favorably on tuesday to a 
statement last week in which albanian president ramiz alia 
expressed interest in establishing diplomatic ties he made the 
same overture to the soviet union 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler in a statement 
referred only indirectly to albanias human rights record 
establishment of diplomatic relations would create the 
opportunity for dialogue through which we would be able to 
communicate our concerns and encourage respect for human rights in 
albania she said 
albania has been one of the worlds most reclusive nations for 
years shunning diplomatic ties with all but a few countries while 
preserving its status as a bulwark of orthodox communism 
it is the only european country that has refused to participate 
in the 35nation grouping than addresses issues related to 
continental security and cooperation 
but alias speech a week ago in addition to making overtures to 
washington and moscow indicated an interest in albanian membership 
in the european group formed 15 years ago in helsinki 
the most recent state department report on human rights 
conditions worldwide released in february said albanians are 
permitted only very limited civil and political rights under 
their marxist government 
the death penalty can be imposed for such nonviolent crimes as 
unauthorized attempts to emigrate or for antigovernment propaganda 
albania officially has been an atheist state since 1967 more 
than 2100 religious structures were shut down and many religious 
leaders were persecuted imprisoned or executed for continuing 
their religious functions the report said 
information about specific human rights abuses has been 
difficult to obtain because of strict official censorship 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group has 
said that repeated appeals to albanian authorities for the release 
of prisoners of conscience have not been answered 
one sign that albania has begun to open up was its decision to 
grant a visa to rep joseph p kennedy dmass he is scheduled to 
visit albania during the first week in june 
he is believed to be the first representative of the us 
government to visit albania since relations were broken before 
world war ii 
james mahoney kennedys executive assistant said tuesday that 
the congressman intends to explore opportunities for cooperation 
with albania 
as for human rights well be looking at those issues before 
departure mahoney said 
state department officials said albania had been sending out 
feelers to the us government expressing interest in broader 
contacts the overtures began about six months ago apparently at 
the time when other communist regimes in eastern europe were 
collapsing 
thus far however albania has been spared the kind of upheaval 
that has taken place elsewhere in eastern europe 
albania has never been a member of the east bloc and looked with 
disdain on those governments accusing them of ideological 
deviationism

common courtesy often goes up in smoke when it 
comes to lighting up indoors smokers do not ask first and 
nonsmokers are unwilling to kick butts researchers say 
half of the smokers surveyed said they light up indoors without 
asking anyone if they mind according to a study in todays journal 
of the american medical association 
and despite the habits declining social acceptability 
nonsmokers are reluctant to ask smokers not to puff even though 
about 90 percent of nonsmokers consider secondhand smoke annoying 
and harmful the study found just 5 percent asked people to put 
out their cigarettes in 1974 and 1987 
the low percentage is striking given that most nonsmokers 
are annoyed by secondhand smoke and consider it harmful to their 
health the researchers wrote a plausible explanation is a 
desire to avoid a confrontation 
the survey of 22043 people found that the proportion of smokers 
who say they dont smoke in indoor public places rose from 5 
percent in 1974 to 33 percent in 1987 
the study also found that when they are inside public places 
that have no rules on smoking 21 percent of smokers will light up 
without hesitation and 26 percent will look around first to see if 
others are smoking then light up 
fourteen percent will ask others if they mind before lighting 
up 33 percent will refrain from smoking and 5 percent will do 
something else 
in washington on tuesday tobacco institute spokeswoman brennan 
dawson said the surveys findings that just 21 percent of smokers 
light up without hesitation demonstrate an enormous application 
of common courtesy 
we are all taught as children to play nicely together she 
said and that travels over into adulthood or at least it 
should smokers are doing a lot of different things according to 
this to play nicely 
but the studys lead researcher dr ronald m davis of the 
centers for disease control said it will take laws and not just 
courtesy to dissuade many smokers from lighting up around 
nonsmokers 
the bottom line is that most nonsmokers are suffering in 
silence said davis director of the cdc office on smoking and 
health at rockville md 
davis noted that surveys have found 29 percent of americans 
smoked in 1987 compared with 40 percent in 1965 and 44 percent in 
1949 
the article said that authorities have concluded that passive 
smoking causes lung cancer in nonsmokers and that a report 
estimated passive smoking causes 3800 lung cancer deaths among 
nonsmokers each year in the united states 
the researchers data were based on results from the 1987 
national health interview survey of cancer epidemiology and control 
and compared with surveys conducted by the roper organization in 
1974 1976 and 1978 the 1987 nationwide random surveys margin of 
error was plus or minus 2 percentage points

roughage has found its champion in the 
physicians committee for responsible medicine which argues youve 
got to eat green food if youre going to be an environmentalist 
eschew meat and save the earth says this outfit eat salads and 
preserve the rain forests 
if youre a meat eater you are contributing to the 
destruction of the environment whether you know it or not says 
neal d bernard president of the 30000member committee which 
observed earth day by passing out recipes for vegetarian chili and 
black beans and rice 
clearly the best thing you can do for the earth is to not 
support animal agriculture says bernard 36 a 1980 graduate of 
the george washington university school of medicine and the nephew 
of two illinois cattle raisers 
mainstream environmentalists say hes gone too far and the 
national cattlemens association picks a bone with him 
the claim that to be a proper environmentalist you cant be a 
meateater is a bunch of bull says cattlemens spokeswoman alisa 
harrison there is no current sound scientific evidence that 
shows that by being a vegetarian youre going to be a better user 
of natural resources 
we dont have a problem with people choosing to become 
vegetarians ms harrison says what we dont like is groups 
like the physicians committee for responsible medicine spreading 
false rumors about our use of natural resources theyre misleading 
and theyre not based on scientific evidence 
but bernard cites statistics to make his case 
it takes 39 times more energy to produce beef than soybeans 
having the same caloric value 
producing enough food to feed a meateater requires 4200 
gallons of water a day to feed a vegetarian requires 300 gallons 
nearly 4 billion tons of topsoil are lost each year in the 
united states chiefly because of overgrazing by livestock and 
unsustainable methods of growing feed 
tropical rain forest is being cleared in latin america to raise 
cattle a pound of hamburger represents 55 square feet of 
burnedoff forest 
intensive cattle raising produces mountains of manure a source 
of methane gas contributor to the greenhouse effect 
most environmentalists dont catch the connection until he 
spells it out for them bernard says 
they picture a pastoral scene a few cows grazing and a few 
chickens clucking he says little do they know that cows are 
raised on enormous feedlots for a portion of their lives and you 
cant keep the manure from running off into streams by and large 
raising animals for food is a very unfriendly industry from an 
environmental viewpoint 
other environmentalists have a yes but response 
its like saying if you drive a car you cant be a good 
environmentalist said michael oppenheimer senior scientist at 
the environmental defense fund who sees a holier than thou 
mentality at work in bernards scenario 
if their point is to draw attention to the effects of 
meateating and let people weigh that in deciding what to do 
environmentally thats understandable oppenheimer said 
meateating is one of the things a lot of americans do in excess 
and could cut down on and do the environment a favor 
added paul allen spokesman for the natural resources defense 
council you can be a vegetarian and still be a lousy 
environmentalist if youre not active and involved 
allen said his group serves mostly fruit and cheese when it has 
a reception but that may be more a function of our not being 
able to afford shrimp

four sons left joaquina garcia nine 
years ago to join the contra rebels and she has not seen them 
since now that the rebels are disarming she hopes to find them 
if theyre still alive 
like dozens of other anxious parents and relatives mrs garcia 
46 plans to spend two days in a nearby un administered security 
zone searching for the young men rebels are gathering in five such 
zones where they are to surrender their weapons before returning 
home 
they went to war nine years ago when they were barely 11 13 
17 and 18 years old i dont know if theyre alive or dead mrs 
garcia said monday 
she said her husband also fled toward honduras five years 
ago leaving her alone with five small children and a little farm 
perched on a rocky mountain slope 
there she grows beans and corn and also takes care of a girl a 
contra woman gave birth to four years ago and then abandoned 
i have been suffering bitterly mrs garcia said 
the ussupported contra rebels were supposed to gather in the 
security zones before presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro 
takes office today 
by tuesday sandinista troops had pulled out of the la rica area 
in northern nicaragua together with armed civilians who guarded a 
sandinistarun cooperative 
the contras an estimated 9000strong inside nicaragua have 
agreed to disarm by june 10 
the la rica zone was opened monday and is run by gen agustin 
quesada the spanish commander of a united nations observation 
force the area includes a camp which can house 2000 contras 
on monday a small group of rebels among the first to arrive 
sat on the banks of a river chatting with friends and relatives and 
washing their fatigues they still carried their sovietdesigned 
ak47 assault rifles and some were carrying hand grenades and 
small missiles 
many echoed their leaders and said they would demand that the 
nicaraguan army be disarmed and purged of its sandinista leaders 
sandinista officers have agreed to give up their party posts while 
retaining military positions 
if the sandinistas continue where they are then we have 
fought in vain said a 30yearold contra who identified himself 
only as rubi 
the nine must leave he added referring to the nine 
commanders of the sandinista revolution who led the insurrection 
that overthrew anastasio somozas dictatorship in july 1979 
one of the commanders is gen humberto ortega the outgoing 
defense minister he stepped down from his party post on monday but 
is to stay on as army chief

three years ago at least seven people died in a contra attack on 
the small cooperative of 30 metalroofed homes 
justina ortez whose 22yearold son was killed defending the 
cooperative said she does not fear the contras 
a rebel who called himself danilo walked through the 
settlement trying to reassure residents the ones you have to 
fear are the nine of the sandinista directorate he kept saying 
on the road linking this village to managua 150 miles to the 
north were three bridges and two sandinista army trucks destroyed 
by the contras 
asked about this one of the rebels shrugged dona violeta

savings and loan bailout officials disagree 
over whether to offer price discounts to speed the sale of 
repossessed real estate 
comptroller of the currency robert clarke who regulates 
nationally chartered banks warned of the consequences that 
discounts could have for struggling sampls and banks operating in 
fragile real estate markets 
however l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp pointed to the potential escalation of taxpayer 
costs if property sales are delayed 
the board of the resolution trust corp on tuesday postponed 
action on the issue for two weeks after the two officials voiced 
their disagreements it had been set to consider a plan that would 
have allowed the agency to sell properties as much as 20 percent to 
30 percent below their appraised value 
seidman is chairman of the rtc board which is conducting the 
cleanup of failed sampls and clarke is a member 
i think we have to be awfully careful clarke said we 
have a number of solvent institutions out in the marketplace 
holding an awful lot of property that wed like to keep out of 
the rtc im not sure we know as much about the broader 
consequences as we should 
the agencys current policy is to sell no property in six 
distressed states texas oklahoma louisiana colorado new 
mexico and arkansas for less than 95 percent of its appraised 
value it is intended to prevent properties from being dumped 
sending depressed properties even lower 
however agency officials are having difficulty attracting bids 
close to the appraised price and want to offer a reduced price 
without a costly and timeconsuming second appraisal 
also in some areas of the country qualified appraisers are 
hard to find because rtc ethics rules preclude hiring anyone 
implicated in an sampl failure 
seidman while agreeing to the twoweek delay said we are 
sitting here with billions of dollars of property which is costing 
us huge amounts of money as long as we keep it 
weve got to convince bidders they can get a bargain from us 
otherwise we wont have any customers he said the 
first citizen volunteering to buy out of patriotic motives has yet 
to come forward 
the policy under consideration would permit the rtc to sell 
property for 85 percent of appraised value after it had gone unsold 
for six months or four months in the case of singlefamily homes 
it would allow an additional 5 percent cut after three more months 
the plan also would allow the agency to sell properties at 
welladvertised auctions for as little a 70 percent of appraised 
value or in the case of properties appraised at less than 
100000 for the highest bid regardless of the appraisal 
the proposal drew praise from analysts who complain real estate 
sales so far have been too slow they said that after the changes 
the agency would still comply with last summers sampl bailout law 
which requires properties in distressed areas be sold at 95 percent 
of market value rather than appraised value 
market value is not what an appraisal says it is its what a 
buyer is willing to pay said robert litan of the brookings 
institution a washington research organization as long as you 
have a sufficient number of bidders that is the market price 
joseph e robert jr chairman of je robert companies an 
alexandria va real estate management firm said he doubted 
prices would be further depressed by quicker sales 
the market has already taken into consideration the overhang 
and the fact that the rtc has this property he said 
in a related matter a bush administration official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said peter monroe a deputy assistant 
housing secretary is the leading candidate for a top position in 
the bailout operation 
he is set to replace william taylor as president of the rtc 
oversight board the treasury departmentled panel that oversees 
the policy and purestrings of the bailout operation seidmans 
board has overall supervision 
taylor a federal reserve board regulator has been serving in 
the position temporarily for four months since daniel kearney quit 
amid reports that he believed the treasury department was giving 
him too little authority

bigcity mayors say they cant fight a war on 
drugs without more money to battle the poverty hopelessness and 
despair that fuels the drug problem 
we are fighting the war on drugs in america today in large 
part because our nation has not prevailed in the war on poverty 
houston mayor kathryn whitmire said as more than 100 mayors 
concluded a twoday meeting tuesday with police chiefs on the drug 
problem 
some democratic mayors leveled a blast at federal drug policy 
chief william bennett saying he was ignoring drug treatment 
education and poverty 
bennett told of their comments shot back some of these 
folks think leadership is coming to washington twice a year and 
complaining 
boston mayor raymond l flynn called bennett a little bit 
hypocritical for focusing on law enforcement and failing to 
address the hopelessness that drives innercity youths to drug 
abuse and the drug trade 
new york mayor david dinkins said bennett who was secretary of 
education in the reagan administration had sent exactly the 
wrong signal by suggesting drug education programs dont work 
bennetts repudiation of drug education was a cynical 
statement from the man who ran the education department through the 
era of just say no dinkins said but it was a typical 
example of the type of leadership were getting from washington 
leadership that says we have more needs and then gives us less 
their comments came a day after bennett addressed the gathering 
and encountered only gently challenging questions 
whats with these guys bennett said in an interview after 
their remarks tuesday i was there yesterday did they wait 
until i leave and then snipe at me 
bennett called dinkins remarks new york bull he said he 
had never repudiated drug education but had said that education 
alone was not sufficient to keep young people away from drugs 
the mayors issued a closing statement urging the bush 
administration to reverse itself on its opposition to providing 
federal aid directly to the cities to fight drugs rather than 
routing it through the states mayors contend states have delayed 
or kept the drug enforcement money for themselves 
the mayors said the war on drugs cannot be fought without 
addressing urban poverty joblessness and despair that encourages 
people to seek escape through drugs and makes drug dealing the 
easiest route to affluence 
whitmire said the mayors want more money for the head start 
program for disadvantaged preschoolers for job training for 
abusers and for drug treatment programs for anyone who wants it 
we can no longer conceive of winning the war unless we are 
able to offer the most basic economic opportunities to all members 
of our communities she said 
flynn at a news conference disputed bennetts assertions that 
overall drug use is down and that most drug abusers have jobs 
flynn said casual drug use may be declining but addiction and 
drugrelated violence is increasing 
the problem of drugs in this country is getting worse and 
worse flynn said its not getting better 
don hamilton bennetts press secretary responding to dinkins 
comments said federal grants to states for drug education has 
almost doubled under the bush administration from 288 million in 
1989 to a proposed 488 million for fiscal 1991

the bush administration is giving up its 
10month fight to win senate confirmation of a former civilian 
nuclear power regulator as head of the nations atomic weapons 
production 
in a letter to president bush released tuesday victor stello 
jr withdrew his name from consideration saying he believed the 
president needed to find someone who could win confirmation to the 
sensitive job at the earliest opportunity 
it has become clear to me that i cannot be that person 
stello wrote in the letter dated april 20 
greenpeace and other national environmental groups as well as 
prominent members of congress strenuously opposed stellos 
nomination they accused him of improper behavior during parts of 
his 24 years with the nuclear regulatory commission which has 
jurisdiction over civilian nuclear reactors 
stello was the nrcs chief staff official before he came to the 
energy department on temporary assignment last july after bush 
nominated him for the weapons chiefs job 
given his questionable record on health and safety issues at 
the nuclear regulatory commission victor stello should not have 
been nominated for this job in the first place sen timothy 
wirth dcolo said in response to stellos withdrawal wirth 
helped lead the campaign against stellos confirmation 
among the accusations against stello is that he altered agency 
rules at the request of nuclear utilities to the detriment of 
safety and that he authorized cash payments to an informer as part 
of a personal vendetta within the nrc 
in two confirmation hearing appearances before the senate armed 
services committee last fall stello strongly denied that he acted 
improperly he asserted that nuclear safety was his primary concern 
and that he was well suited for the job 
the withdrawal of the stello nomination ends an extraordinary 
chapter in the administrations effort to revitalize the crippled 
nuclear weapons complex by putting an experienced nuclear power 
expert in charge for the first time 
key elements of the weapons complex which include 17 major 
production plants and laboratories in 12 states are shut down 
because of safety and management problems 
tom olson an energy department spokesman said stello would 
remain at the department in a civil service job that does not 
require senate confirmation his responsibilities will include 
overseeing efforts to restart idled reactors at the savannah river 
nuclear weapons plant in south carolina olson said 
energy secretary james d watkins said during the senate 
hearings that stello was the only qualified person willing to take 
the job 
olson said tuesday evening that watkins had no comment on 
stellos withdrawal 
the armed services committee was set to recommend stellos 
confirmation in january but balked upon learning that he was the 
focus of an investigation by david williams the nrc inspector 
general 
williams is investigating allegations that stello and other nrc 
officials pursued a vendetta against roger fortuna who was in 
charge of investigating wrongdoing at nuclear plants the 
allegation was that stello believed fortuna was too hard on the 
industry 
the results of williams investigation have not been made 
public but in his letter to bush stello noted that the armed 
services committee planned to hold up further consideration of his 
nomination until it reviewed them 
my experience over this past year has led me to the conclusion 
that final action by the senate on my nomination will not take 
place in the foreseeable future he wrote

the exxon corp says it isnt happy with the 
way the federal government is trying to assess the longterm 
damages from last years alaska oil spill and doesnt plan to 
contribute any more money for the effort 
officials of an interagency trustee council told a 
congressional hearing tuesday that efforts to determine the 
evironmental damages caused by the massive spill from the tanker 
exxon valdez cost 354 million in the first year more than twice 
the amount provided by exxon 
damage assessment studies to be continued this year could cost 
an additional 30 million according to an internal trustee council 
document made public by a house interior and insular affairs 
subcommittee 
shortly after the march 24 1989 spill in alaskas prince 
william sound exxon agreed to provide 15 million an an initial 
payment for the government damage assessment program interior 
secretary manuel lujan at the time characterized the payment as 
only a first installment from the oil company 
but members of the trustee council told the subcommittee on 
water power and offshore energy resources tuesday that exxon has 
stonewalled requests for additional money 
the trustees have requested that exxon fund the remaining 20 
million of 1989 costs but so far exxon has declined to respond 
to that request said alan raul general counsel of the 
agriculture department and a member of the trustee council 
the minutes of a march meeting of the trustee council released 
by the subcommittee quoted justice department officals as advising 
the participants they should not expect further money from 
exxon 
the cost of damage assessment will be borne by the federal 
government although some of the money likely will be recovered as 
part of the damages sought from exxon in a civil suit that is yet 
to be filed against the oil company 
cm harrison executive vice president of exxon co usa 
acknowledged that exxon plans no further payments for damage 
assessments 
the process has not worked as exxon anticipated harrison 
said in a statement to the subcommittee he complained exxon was 
not given access to data collected as part of the damage assessment 
process and said there was too much emphasis on litigation 
exxon so far has spent more than 1 billion in cleanup costs 
from the spill which contaminated miles of scenic alaska 
coastline the justice department also is pursuing criminal charges 
against exxon that could lead to fines and penalties of more than 
600 million upon conviction 
meanwhile several environment groups complained the damage 
assessment process is inadequate and money shortages are causing 
the trustees to curtail some studies essential to determining 
overall harm to wildlife and natural resources 
it was previously reported that the trustees decided in their 
march meeting not to proceed with 24 of the 63 damage assessment 
studies 
the lawyers and not the scientists have driven the assessment 
process complained erik olson of the national wildlife 
federation he maintained some of the studies were halted because 
they were too expensive and likely would not produce large payoffs 
in damage recovery as a result of the eventual civil suit agaist 
exxon 
apparently decisions on which studies to continue are based 
at least in part on financial considerations said robert adler 
a lawyer for the natural resources defense council 
members of the trustee council are officials of the agriculture 
department interior department and the commerce departments 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration

police investigating a smuggling operation 
stumbled across a factory in brooklyn that was producing millions 
of vials used to peddle crack 
the factory in a onestory garage was discovered monday when 
police were looking for a gang member wanted for producing drug 
paraphernalia authorities said 
customs officials said the factory was the largest found in the 
new york metropolitan area and probably was turning out 2 million 
of the plastic halfinch vials a day 
four or five times weve found machinery but nothing close to 
this scale said customs agent victoria ovis 
three people were arrested under a state law passed last summer 
against producing drug paraphernalia customs officials also said 
they seized three plastic molding machines and hundreds of 
thousands of vials 
the owner of the building was not identified police said 
crack vials previously were imported from southeast asia and 
labeled as perfume containers on shipping manifests 
but since 1987 when a federal law outlawing imports of drug 
paraphernalia went into effect domestic production of the 
containers has increased the new york times reported today 
making packages for illegal drugs is estimated to be a 1 
billionayear industry

lawmakers are criticizing the defense 
department for removing the director of its high technology 
research agency 
members of congress said the defense advanced research projects 
agency is the only place in government where tax dollars are used 
to promote cuttingedge technology that can help make us 
businesses more competitive overseas 
the pentagon said craig fields who headed darpa for a year was 
transferred rather than fired from the agency but his supporters 
in industry and in congress contended fields was removed last 
friday for emphasizing dualuse technology which has civilian as 
well as military applications 
this is the triumph of ideology over the national interest 
said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
gephardt referred to conservatives in the administration who 
argue that government should refrain from investing in nondefense 
research from which private industry would profit they say the 
free market should be allowed to work and that industry should 
finance its own research 
gephardt was among 11 lawmakers of both parties who signed a 
letter tuesday urging the defense department to reinstate fields to 
his post at darpa he also asked the house armed services committee 
to investigate the situation 
the research agency has a 12 billion budget about half of 
which goes to dualuse technologies rep mel levine dcalif 
said at a news conference 
darpafunded projects include super computers artificial 
intelligence software semiconductor manufacturing technology and 
biotechnology levine whose home state is a hightechnology 
center is cochairman of the congressional hightechnology caucus 
levine also chairs rebuild america a publicpolicy group that 
promotes hightechnology industries he said he is drafting 
legislation that would put darpa under control of the commerce 
department and require that funds be spent only on dualuse 
technology except in special cases 
sen john heinz rpa who signed the letter said he does not 
want president bush to go down in history as the president who 
presided over the economic decline of the united states of america 
because he and members of his administration were blind 
he was joined by rep don ritter rpa who is chairman of the 
congressional technology and policy task force as well as ranking 
member of the commerce and competitiveness subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee 
other signers of the protest letter were reps les aucoin 
dore norman mineta dcalif edward markey dmass nicholas 
mavroules dmass marcy kaptur dohio and helen d bentley 
rmd and sen albert gore jr dtenn chairman of the senate 
commerce subcommittee on science technology and space 
a pentagon statement said fields on may 6 would begin serving in 
a new post that would make him responsible for evaluating and 
recommending actions to streamline the large and complex research 
and development laboratory infrastructure of the defense 
department 
it said victor reis the deputy director of darpa has been 
named acting director pending the appointment of a new director

when john yervant was 8 years old he says 
the ottoman empire the forerunner of modernday turkey ordered 
all armenian residents to leave the town of erzerum 
yervants family embarked on a harrowing journey eating grass 
to survive stumbling across dismembered bodies seeing babies 
trampled by horses his father yervant says was tortured and 
killed by the turks 
on tuesday yervant 83 knocked on the door of the turkish 
embassy to deliver a petition demanding that turkey admit to the 
armenians claim that the ottoman empire committed genocide and 
killed 15 million armenians between 1915 and 1923 
the embassy refused to open the door we know very well what 
they want and we dont deal with them said press counselor tacan 
ildem 
yervant was among several hundred armenians who staged a protest 
outside the embassy on the 75th anniversary of the start of the 
armenian deportations commemorative events also were being held in 
chicago dallas san francisco and new york among other cities 
turkey says 300000 armenians died in the deportations but 
rejects the accusation of genocide saying turks and armenians 
alike were the victims of a civil war famine and epidemic turkey 
says armenians started the civil war in collusion with czarist 
russia in order to secede from the waning ottoman empire 
in a statement on the senate floor minority leader robert dole 
rkansas said 15 million armenians were killed as a result of 
conscious vicious policies of the ottoman empire 
dole led a fight in february for a resolution commemorating 
april 24 as armenian genocide day but the measure was defeated 
under strong pressure from turkey and its lobbyists in washington 
we ought to be ashamed he said one reason 6 million jews 
were slaughtered is because of hitlers conviction that no one 
remembered the armenian genocide 
president bush whose administration also opposed the 
resolution issued a proclamation to the nearly 1 million american 
armenians marking april 24 as a day of remembrance for the more 
than a million armenian people who were victims although he 
deliberately refrained from using the word genocide supporters 
of turkey were angered 
armenians who trace their roots to the second millennium bc 
once commanded a mighty empire stretching from the caspian sea to 
the mediterranean 
in modern times armenians enjoyed a twoyear period of 
independence in 1918 on territory that is now the soviet republic 
of armenia today about 4 million live in the soviet union and 
another 3 are scattered in turkey lebanon iran france and the 
united states 
yervants story had a happy ending he was placed in an 
orphanage ran away to france and became a dancer with the folies 
bergeres he came on tour to the united states during the 1930s and 
stayed

once the euphoria fades from the homecoming of 
longterm hostages such as robert polhill they risk another 
prison built of depression anger anxiety and a host of other 
mental problems 
they may also face families that learned to live without them 
and a society that forces them to play heroes while blaming them 
for their captivity 
still such problems can be avoided or eased by proper mental 
health care and the basic resilience many hostages show experts 
say 
the remarkable thing isnt that they have problems when they 
return to the environment but that people do successfully return 
that they do reconstruct their lives said dr harry holloway 
chairman of psychiatry at the uniformed services university of the 
health sciences in bethesda md 
in fact david jacobsen who spent nearly 17 months as a captive 
in lebanon before gaining freedom in 1986 says the experience can 
make a person more tolerant and understanding 
you really come to grasp what are the real values of life 
he said in a recent interview you understand what it is as an 
innocent person to make it through another day of hell 
polhill who rejoined his family this week after more than three 
years in captivity in lebanon is at the us air force hospital in 
wiesbaden west germany 
col dr kenneth koskinen medical director of the hospital 
said the exhostage is intellectually very sharp has a great 
sense of humor and considering his ordeal has a reasonably 
positive mental status 
that is encouraging but university of maryland psychiatrist dr 
david mcduff cautioned tuesday that recovery from being a hostage 
is a longterm process that can take many years 
lingering problems can include anger and depression that began 
during captivity said former state department chief psychologist 
samuel karson who oversaw evaluations at the wiesbaden hospital of 
americans who had been hostages in iran 
anger arises as a captive starts thinking why are they doing 
this to me karson said the anger toward captors is compounded 
because a hostage is helpless to act on it he said 
you cant understand their language they have full control 
over you and youre turned into a helpless child all over again 
a hostage can also be angry at the us government for not 
getting him out sooner he said 
depression can begin from the separation from family and the 
insecurity about ones future he said and it does not simply 
disappear upon release he said 
im afraid peoples internal systems dont work like a radio 
or tv set where you just flick the switch now its off he 
said 
immediately after release an exhostage may also dwell 
harmfully on his actions during captivity said mcduff who has 
participated in army teams that recovered hostages and hijacking 
victims 
hostages can become extremely selfcritical as they review 
their actions feelings and thoughts mcduff said they might blame 
themselves for not stopping beatings other hostages received or 
for thoughts about harming their captors he said 
former captives often fail to see that the rules in the middle 
of a period of captivity really have more to do with survival than 
with anything else its not like the normal world 
a released hostage may also risk posttraumatic stress disorder 
which can include excessive dwelling on the hostage experience a 
withdrawing from contacts and activities that might trigger 
recollections and anxiety 
still other difficulties can spring from adjusting to the 
private and public worlds to which a longterm hostage returns his 
children have grown years older shaped by a culture that differs 
markedly from the life he endured for years holloway noted and he 
must fit into a family that has built a life without him holloway 
said 
the hostage also faces the expectations and attitudes of 
society hostages are pressured into the roles of heroes when 
theyre not feeling very heroic holloway said 
paradoxically society may also blame them for being taken 
hostage mcduff said in order to feel comfortable in this 
world he said we have to believe and think that things like 
this dont happen unless somebody does something that makes it 
happen 
what can be done to help newly freed hostages cope with their 
return 
a key step experts say is to give them immediately a week or 
so out of the public eye much like the decompression period 
deepsea divers take to adjust to a normal atmosphere 
during this time hostages can become acquainted with their 
families and the changes they missed they can come to terms with 
their thoughts and actions in captivity they can vent and deal 
with anger 
let them make the choices karson said thats how they 
realize that they really are free again

democrats on the senate budget committee 
trying to craft a 1991 budget face an uncertain path while the 
major hurdle to house passage of a similar package seems to be 
dissolving 
the senate panel was meeting for the second day today to try to 
write its version of a 12 trillion spending package tuesdays 
opening session spotlighted the disarray on the panel 
chairman james sasser dtenn was ready to let the committee 
vote on several proposals and said he believed the panel would 
ultimately approve about 40 billion in budget cuts 
but some democrats said they would offer plans of their own 
two of them sens ernest hollings dsc and charles robb 
dva might not vote for sassers proposals asserting that more 
dramatic budgetcutting is needed 
with democrats holding a 1310 majority on the panel and 
republicans expected to oppose any democratic package the 
prospects for approval seemed uncertain 
gop lawmakers said they were unhappy with the democratic 
alternatives saying they would be meaningless unless the white 
house and congress could negotiate ways to pare the deficit 
republicans also said the democratic plans would fall short of 
reducing the 1991 deficit to 64 billion as the grammrudman law 
requires 
were going to be 20 billion off predicted sen pete 
domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the budget committee 
across the capitol conservative house democrats displeased 
with the defense cuts their partys 124 trillion spending plan 
would impose seemed likely to vote for it anyway 
their support would probably assure approval of the measure in 
the democraticdominated house where debate was scheduled to begin 
today 
the conservatives reasoned that approving the measure would move 
the process one step closer to negotiations with the 
administration which they believe are necessary 
i sense a general leaning reluctantly so to support the 
budget and move the process to the next step said rep charles 
stenholm of texas a leader of about 40 conservative democrats 
thats what i intend to do 
like their senate counterparts house republicans are nearly all 
opposed to the democratic budget they say only bargaining between 
president bush and congressional leaders will produce a legitimate 
spending blueprint for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
the house budget would set defense spending at 295 billion 8 
billion less than what bush wants

restrictions on the use of federal aids 
prevention and education funds are prolonging the epidemic and 
should be removed the national commission on aids says 
the restrictions are preventing communities from targeting 
effective messages on how the aids virus is spread and what people 
can do to protect against it such as using condoms and cleaning 
intravenous needles the panel said tuesday 
our only weapon is education said june osborn commission 
chairwoman to put some artificial limits on that is like 
declaring youre only going to use a certain caliber of weapon 
to fight a war 
the recommendation to remove these restrictions was one of five 
made by the commission in its second report to president bush 
the panel also urged bush to coordinate the federal governments 
response to the epidemic to support legislation to provide 600 
million in federal funds to areas hit hard by the disease and to 
pump federal dollars into housing for people with aids 
in addition commissioners sought house support for an 
antidiscrimination bill that has been passed by the senate and 
endorsed by bush 
because aids is transmitted chiefly through sexual intercourse 
with an infected person and by sharing needles with an infected 
ivdrug user the content of governmentfunded messages about 
spread of the disease has been a subject of sensitivity 
an example of contentrestrictions can be found in the centers 
for disease controls proposed revisions of regulations on 
aidsrelated education materials produced with cdc funds 
one provision requires that this material not contain terms 
descriptions or displays which will be offensive to a majority of 
the intended audience or to a majority of persons outside the 
intended audience 
another provision of that regulation says federally funded 
educational programs and materials shall not be designed to 
promote or encourage directly intravenous drug abuse or sexual 
activity homosexual or heterosexual 
commission member diane ahrens who directed a working group on 
government responsibilities and is a county commissioner in st 
paul minn said the restrictions make it difficult for 
communities to target those most at risk of getting aids 
theres a feeling that its inappropriate for washington or 
atlanta cdc headquarters to tell folks in the south bronx or 
boise idaho how they should direct their educational programs 
she said what is appropriate for the south bronx may not be 
appropriate for boise 
were talking about a deadly disease here she said you 
have to talk about using bleach to disinfect needles if they are 
abusing drugs you need to talk about use of condoms and that 
may not be acceptable to some communities but you have to be 
relevant to the community youre trying to reach 
in some cases states and cities are imposing similar 
restrictions on the use of their funds 
the chilling effect sort of permeates the system said 
commission spokesman tom brandt

the senate says it wont agree to cut the 
tariff on tennis shoes manufactured in the caribbean after a 
debate that featured several members waving various brands of shoes 
in the air 
on a 6333 vote tuesday night and despite the desires of the 
bush administration the senate rejected cutting in half the 48 
percent to 67 percent tariffs on rubbersole canvastop athletic 
shoes produced in the caribbean 
to opponents led by senate democratic leader george mitchell of 
maine the issue was jobs not shoes capitalizing on the teenage 
mutant ninja turtles fad 
this amendment will destroy an industry and cost 
hundreds if not thousands of jobs in this country said mitchell 
citing 800 mostly elderly and women workers at new balance and 
etonic athletic shoe plants in his state 
the amendment by sen bob graham who held up a pair of 795 
ninja turtle shoes was defeated after sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas said its passage could kill a bill providing permanent 
dutyfree status for most imports from the caribbean and central 
america 
the us industry is on its knees and its not fair to make 
matters worse said bentsen who as chairman of the senate 
finance committee is one of the most powerful voices in congress on 
trade issues 
the overall bill was approved later on a 920 vote after the 
senate agreed to a further amendment banning imports from burma 
over alleged human rights violations 
it now goes to a conference committee with members of the house 
where similar legislation making the caribbean basin initiative 
permanent was approved last year 
graham and other supporters of his amendment argued it would 
shift jobs in the tennis shoe industry to the caribbean from china 
korea taiwan and other far east countries 
the question is not about whether jobs will be lost in the 
united states said sen bob packwood rore the real debate 
is whether were going to move production from mainland china a 
country that massacres its students to struggling democracies 
in the caribbean 
packwood waved a pair of shoes that later were pointed out to be 
koreanmade 
opponents however also waved various brands of tennis shoes 
produced in their states and said the joblosers would be americans 
rather than chinese and koreans 
they said 11000 us jobs have been lost since 1980 when half 
of all shoes sold in this country were usmade 
today with only 8000 americans still employed in shoe 
manufacturing they said imports now account for 82 percent of all 
shoes sold in the country and 74 percent of the athletic shoes 
earlier tuesday the senate approved several amendments 
including one by packwood that would prohibit the export of logs 
harvested on governmentowned forest land 
the bill extends indefinitely the dutyfree access of caribbean 
goods an authority that otherwise would expire in 1995 it also 
continues a variety of temporary duty suspensions for various 
chemicals and manufacturing components not produced domestically 
in addition the legislation lifts trade sanctions imposed in 
1985 against nicaragua including the restoration of a sugar quota 
worth up to 33 million this year 
the 1983 caribbean basin initiative was intended to lift the 
depressed economies of 24 caribbean and central american countries 
through a combination of direct aid and an elimination of tariffs 
and quotas to encourage new export industries in the region 
excluded from the dutyfree program however were various 
classifications of textiles clothing luggage shoes dinnerware 
leather products and other sensitive goods that compete 
directly with usmade products

john poindexters lawyers are urging acquittal 
or a new trial for the former national security adviser asserting 
that irancontra prosecutors failed to prove their case and used 
the defendants protected testimony to convict him 
in posttrial motions the lawyers said tuesday that poindexter 
was victimized by statements he gave to congress under a grant of 
immunity from prosecution and that he therefore should be retried 
former white house aide oliver north testified that he watched 
as poindexter tore up a presidential document ratifying a shipment 
of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran 
at poindexters trial rep lee hamilton dind blurted out a 
reference to poindexter destroying the document 
the testimony of both witnesses was derived from admiral 
poindexters immunized testimony the defense attorneys contended 
the politically embarrassing document that poindexter destroyed 
portrayed the us government as trading arms for hostages 
something thenpresident reagan had said he would never do 
no part of a criminal case may be based on a defendants 
statements given under a grant of immunity 
poindexter was convicted april 7 of conspiracy two counts of 
obstructing congress and two counts of making false statements 
a jury of eight women and four men found he had covered up from 
congress norths secret contra resupply network and the us role 
in the november 1985 hawk missile shipment 
in urging us district judge harold greene to issue a judgment 
of acquittal poindexters lawyers said prosecutors 
failed to prove there was a single conspiracy joining the 
contra and iran portions of the case 
didnt show that poindexter knew there was an official 
congressional inquiry into norths contra activities 
presented no evidence to show that poindexter intended to 
obstruct congress when he deleted 5000 computer messages 
didnt explain how his alleged lies to congress about the 
missile shipment were material to the congressional inquiries 
poindexters lawyers also said greene made prejudicial comments 
that warrant a new trial 
as an example they pointed to the judges suggestion at one 
point during norths testimony that there was evidence of a 
conspiracy 
prosecutor dan webb also clearly prejudiced poindexter by 
suggesting in a highly inflammatory closing argument that 
reagan had lied to the american public about the iran initiative 
said poindexters lawyers 
webb said you dont lie to the american public the 
prosecutor was referring to reagans statement on nov 13 1986 in 
a nationally televised address that the us government didnt 
trade arms for hostages

two ak47 assault rifles stand in the 
corner and vladimir i lenin gazes down from a cyrilliccaptioned 
photograph in the office of jose ortiz who promises a strong civic 
opposition from the sandinistas 
the city of esteli called the cradle of the revolution 
remains a bastion perhaps the last of the outgoing leftists who 
ousted the tyrannical somoza family dynasty 11 years ago 
estelis inhabitants are sad to see the revolution wane 
the fsln remains by far the strongest political party says 
the 49yearold ortiz leader of the regional branch of the 
sandinista workers federation 
the former construction worker and guerrilla combatant used the 
initials for the sandinista national liberation front which is 
handing over the reins of government to violeta barrios de chamorro 
none of those 14 little parties would have gotten even a pinky 
finger into political power on their own he said refering to 
the broad alliance that propelled mrs chamorro to the presidency 
he commented in his office on the main square of this 
northcentral city of 31000 residents the only metropolis of 
considerable size won by the sandinistas in the feb 25 elections 
nationwide the presidential legislative and municipal ballot 
was a landslide for the united national opposition coalition uno 
many of the pastelpainted buildings along esteli streets are 
still pocked with bullet holes from fierce combat during the 
revolution that brought the sandinistas to power part of downtown 
was demolished by bombs and rockets delivered by president 
anastasio somozas warplanes 
some walls are patched others wear colorful murals of militia 
men and women brandishing arms sandinista doctors administering 
vaccines young militants teaching peasants to read 
it was a social experiment hailed throughout the hemisphere 
maybe because we in this city suffered more than anyone weve 
been the ones to more completely understand what the revolution 
meant said rafael chavarria an accountant waiting for a bus on 
the sidewalk along the lovely central plaza 
chavarria the son of peasant farmers identified closely with 
the sandinistas but is not a party militant 
its clear that since the revolution more poor people have 
been able to overcome their circumstances and make for themselves a 
better life than their parents life he said 
now our role must be one of constructive criticism to call 
the new governments attention to what goes wrong but always by 
civic means he said eschewing any recourse to violence 
indeed after the nearly decadelong insurgency of the 
usfunded contra rebels what he and ortiz and most nicaraguans 
appear to most fervently desire from the transition is peace 
people did not vote for either conservatives or communists or 
any of the parties in uno nor did they vote against the 
sandinistas contended ortiz what they voted for was peace 
because they believed that if the sandinistas won the contra war 
imposed by the united states would continue 
most of the comrades sandinistas understand this transition 
otherwise we wouldnt be handing over power peacefully were not 
radicals he said 
the sandinista movement was not born july 19 1979 the date 
of the revolutionary victory we have decades of experience of 
political struggle now our job is to present opposition a strong 
opposition were going to defend what weve achieved 
he and chavarria agreed that three things threaten nicaragua 
renewed and escalated civil strife failure of an estimated 9000 
contra rebels to demobilize by june 10 as they have promised and 
revanchist antisandinista measures by the new government 
mrs chamorro has insisted that her principal objective is 
reconciliation 
if the idea is to wipe the slate clean and start anew then we 
can achieve peace said chavarria but if they start with you 
did this to me so im doing this to you he shook his head 
as his voice trailed off 
asked why he had the sovietmade assault rifle in his office 
ortiz defended the concept of a militia 
all the weapons belong in the hands of the people he said 
im not going to use that gun in any aggressive way but if any 
sob contra comes after me im ready to blow him away

a man who committed suicide shortly after a 
bomb he built maimed a 5yearold girl at a k mart a year ago may 
have taken his life because a good little girl was the victim 
his stepfather says 
david l swinford 19 shot himself in the head in a car on a 
rural road on april 19 1989 two days after the bombing and hours 
after having discussed the blast with his mother and sister 
authorities said tuesday 
swinford of rural noblesville was identified as a possible 
suspect within days of the bombing but investigators only recently 
developed conclusive evidence he built the device said charles 
petersen agent in charge of the us bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms in indianapolis 
tests on a screwdriver and knife from swinfords car determined 
they were used in making the pipe bomb which was concealed in a 
pumptype toothpaste dispenser and blew the girls hand off as she 
lifted it from a shelf petersen said 
petersen said authorities knew of no motive for the bombing 
but swinfords stepfather david w whitesell recalled a 
conversation his family had while watching a tv account of the 
bombing a few hours after the incident 
during the discussion whitesell said his wife grace wondered 
aloud who would commit such a crime involving a child 
david replied what business did a little girl have to do in 
the trash bag department whitesell recalled if he really did 
do this i think it was a real blow to him to find out that a good 
little girl was the victim 
erin bower now 6 now wears an artificial limb to replace the 
left hand she lost in the blast she was scheduled this month for a 
cornea transplant in her left eye also damaged in the explosion 
her mother maureen bower expressed sympathy over swinfords 
death 
im sorry the boy felt he had to take his life over it 
somehow i think that as well as erin has done we could have found 
forgiveness for him mrs bower told wthrtv tuesday night 
while swinford was withdrawn around adults and was asked to move 
out of the home following disagreements his mother and stepfather 
said he loved children 
mrs whitesell said her son would play with the couples 
children paula 4 and 15monthold twins brittany and paul 
there was a point that i suggested he go into something where 
he could work with disabled children because our boy has downs 
syndrome and david always related well with him mrs whitesell 
said 
whitesell said his stepson never confessed to the bombing 
petersen said there was no evidence swinford actually placed the 
bomb on the shelf and he may have had an accomplice 
swinford knew about bombmaking and electrical wiring from 
building crude firecracker devices with friends and from working 
with his stepfather in electronic installation petersen said 
despite the evidence announced tuesday whitesell said his 
family was uncertain whether to believe his stepson had a role in 
the bombing 
sometimes i feel like its easy to pick on the dead suspect 
whitesell said on the other hand the only way to be sure is for 
david to come and tell me himself and he cant do that

saying she is a former agent of chilean secret police known as 
dina and that she traveled to the united states in 1976 under the 
assumed name of liliana walker 
the supreme court ordered the military court that handled the 
case before it was closed to question the woman who has been under 
police protection at an undisclosed location since going public

lithuania should be patient about gaining 
independence from the soviet union without compromising on its 
ultimate goal advises a leader of solidarity the movement that 
brought democracy to poland 
bronislaw geremek political adviser to solidarity founder lech 
walesa and the movements parliamentary leader urged western 
governments to recognize both sides of the tense conflict between 
lithuania and the kremlin 
first that the lithuanians are right fighting for their 
freedom and national independence and second one should seek to 
find in what way the soviet union can accept and cope with this 
new situation he said tuesday in a speech at the national press 
club 
geremek said he admires the lithuanian independence leaders but 
added until now they have no experience of compromise political 
dialogue and political deal and they have to learn it as we have 
learned it within a few months and i hope that our friends in 
lithuania will go the same way 
it means that one cannot have a compromise concerning values 
and aspirations but one can have a compromise concerning the 
time he added the forum was sponsored by the atlantic council 
and the german marshall fund us and west german organizations 
supporting foreign policy research and international exchange 
the lithuanian conflict confirms the words of andrei sakharov 
longtime soviet dissident a few months before his death last year 
that the very future of the soviet union depends on its changing 
its structure geremek said 
he added that he hopes the soviet union realizes this and that 
the united states and other western governments understand both 
sides of the problem 
the visiting solidarity leader a historian twice jailed for 
dissident activity under the fallen communist government was 
elected to parliament last year representing suwalki a region on 
the polishlithuanian border 
democracy in the central european countries is still very weak 
he said and while communism has no chance for a comeback real 
danger of a new authoritarian system exists in all central european 
countries if economic reforms fail 
the drastic austerity of polands economic reforms is being 
watched closely by hungary czechoslovakia and other central 
european countries as well as the soviet union itself and 
ultimately they might require similar measures he said 
countries have moved from dictatorship to democracy but 
polands efforts to return from totalitarian economy to market 
economy never happened in history he said the results of this 
first experiment will have its importance for other countries in 
the same situation 
after 1000 percent inflation last year poland began 1990 with 
price increases monetary and other reforms and inflation dropped 
from 80 percent in january to 5 percent in march geremek said 
the social cost has been high he said with dangerous 
recession trends including a 30 percent drop in industrial 
production and unemployment soaring from under 50000 to 300000 
with promise of much bigger rises by the end of the year

a quarter century after congress sought to 
beautify the nations highways billboards still blight the 
landscape a coalition of public officials and environmentalists 
say 
giant billboards on metal posts as much as 150 feet tall have 
replaced the 15foot plywood signs that dotted highways in the 
mid1960s and according to a group proposing a ban on new 
billboards along federal highways advertisers have used loopholes 
and amendments in the 1965 highway beautification law to cut down 
public trees and spend taxpayer dollars to take down old signs 
the highway beautification act of 1965 despite its good 
intentions has not lived up to its expectations sen john 
chafee rri author of the billboard proposal told the senate 
tuesday 
the answer proposed by chafee several senate and house 
colleagues houston mayor kathy whitmire and several environmental 
groups is to take power away from the federal government 
the legislation in addition to banning new billboards on major 
federal highways would allow states cities and towns to remove 
existing billboards along those roadways using a courttested 
amortization process the communities could remove the signs in as 
little as five years at no cost to taxpayers according to chafee

in the face of declining readership some 
newspapers are succeeding by remaining close to their subscribers 
and by building loyal reporting staffs with authoritative knowledge 
of the communities they cover 
in a report submitted tuesday at the american newspaper 
publishers association a research group dubbed the ateam told 
what made three newspapers more successful than most 
group members said they found different formulas at the free 
lancestar of fredericksburg va the cedar rapids iowa gazette 
and the pressenterprise of riverside calif 
but one trait was universal they knew their markets cold and 
were always updating their understanding said michelle foster 
marketing director of the newspress of fort myers fla and a 
member of the research group 
seymour topping director of editorial development for the new 
york times regional newspaper group said a team approach to 
running the newspapers helped he added that each gave its readers 
a complete paper with local national and international news 
harold f woldt jr vice presidentcirculation of newsday of 
long island ny pointed to a loyal staff as a key to success at 
all three papers he stressed that only if core personnel are 
retained can they know the communities they serve 
he said the three papers had unusual stability among their 
staff accomplished through publisher involvement better pay and a 
sense of institutional commitment to the newspaper 
the presentation was chaired by william j keating chairman and 
publisher of the cincinnati enquirer who declared the report gave 
him renewed faith that we the newspaper people of america can 
meet the challenge 
in other events tuesday at the associations 104th annual 
convention the nations newspaper publishers discussed declining 
readership telecommunications developments affecting papers and 
recycling of newsprint 
to build greater reader interest an advertising consultant 
advised newspapers to focus on local news suggesting international 
issues dont sell advertising 
the comments came during a panel discussion titled ozzie and 
harriet are gone who do you think youre writing for the 
discussion was moderated by jeff greenfield of abc news 
virginia dodge fielder vice president of research for 
knightridder inc expressed industry frustration over vanishing 
readers 
i wish they expressed more dissatisfaction because if they did 
wed know how to tackle it she said what the public is saying 
is not i hate you but i dont need you 
the session opened with video interviews in which subjects were 
asked if they read a newspaper 
i dont have time was a common response several said tv 
news was easier one man said that since big business had taken 
over his local paper he felt less connected to it the comment 
echoed a message emphasized by laurel cutler vice chairman of 
fcbleber katz partners and vice president of consumer affairs for 
the chrysler corp 
the only specialized thing about a newspaper is its 
locality she told the audience localness is what you have to 
sell 
but frank a daniels jr president and publisher of the news amp 
observer of raleigh nc interjected that a newspaper 
traditionally has been a smorgasbord 
ms cutler warned against newspapers trying to be all things 
to all people 
greenfield suggested that the puzzle of declining readership may 
not be complex is it possible that the reason people read 
newspapers so devotedly in 1940 is there was nothing else to inform 
them he asked 
publishers and editors on the panel disagreed 
one thing you may be overlooking is how adaptable newspapers 
are said c shelby coffey iii editor and executive vice 
president of the los angeles times 
he noted the times has numerous regional bureaus to keep the 
paper local but has inaugurated a world report section on 
global developments research at the times shows that 
international news is of great interest to readers he said 
coffey and gerald garcia editor and publisher of the knoxville 
tenn journal also urged development of a multiethnic reporting 
force 
publishers were also told they must move to recycle newsprint to 
stave off government interference 
frank a bennack jr president and chief executive officer of 
the hearst corp in new york and chairman of the anpa newsprint 
resource task force painted a grim picture of vanishing landfills 
he said publishers have resolved to double the amount of 
recycled newsprint used in the coming year reaching a total of 46 
million tons 
we believe efforts to control newsprint can mean efforts to 
control the press he said the prospect of dealing with a 
regulated newsprint industry calls up an array of terrifying 
unknowns 
he said 35 percent of newspapers are recycled and publishers 
aim to bring that up to 50 percent 
bennack said that in 1979 the nation had 18000 landfills 
available today only 6500 remain he said and by 1995 that 
figure will diminish to 4200 
bennack stressed that newsprint makes up only 8 percent of solid 
waste in landfills 
in a separate development publishers were told they may be 
close to winning a sixyear dispute with the bell 
telecommunications companies 
robert m johnson publisher president and chief executive 
officer of newsday inc of long island ny reported that 
congress is likely to pass a bill soon setting a telecommunications 
public policy 
citing antitrust laws us district judge harold greene held 
that those who control telecommunication lines should not also 
control the information that goes over those lines johnson said 
he recounted that bell companies lobbied for exceptions to the 
1984 court ruling on the breakup of atampt 
johnson said the bell companies have set aside a 25 million 
war chest to fight to publish information on electronic 
circuits he said bell seeks to launch an electronic yellow 
pages in competition with newspaper ads 
an anpa task force has worked with congress johnson said 
the result of those long negotiations was a new draft bill 
he said it is from our point of view the best piece of 
legislation weve seen 
the bill has not yet been passed an appeal of the original 
federal order has sent that back to greene for reconsideration

a former hotdogging prosecutor pleaded 
guilty to falsely claiming armed drug dealers in a speeding car had 
tried to assassinate him 
samuel asbell was barred tuesday from ever holding public office 
again and agreed to pay 12000 to cover the cost of investigating 
his tale he faces up to 18 months in prison or a 7500 fine 
no sentencing date was set for the former camden county 
prosecutor who used to accompany detectives on drug raids toted a 
gun in a shoulder holster and wore a bushy walrusstyle moustache 
in pleading guilty to providing false information to police 
asbell told superior court judge samuel lenox that he sought 
counseling and now knows why he concocted the story he did not 
elaborate after court he refused comment 
asbell in january had claimed at a news conference that he 
narrowly escaped death at the hands of two drug dealers who chased 
him through the streets of camden on new years day and shot out 
the windows of his car he claimed he returned fire with a 
sawedoff shotgun and saw one assailants head explode 
a state investigation failed to find a body or any witnesses to 
the chase asbell resigned and checked into a psychiatric hospital 
on jan 4 after he was confronted with details of the probe 
investigators said asbell shot out the windows of his own car to 
back up his story 
roosevelt nesmith vice president of the new jersey chapter of 
the naacp charged that the plea bargain suggests selective 
prosecution and a doublestandard asbell had said his assailants 
were black 
did he apologize to the black community nesmith said it 
shows to me very little or no respect for the black community 
the naacp leader has called for the appointment of an 
independent prosecutor to review camden county criminal cases 
overseen by asbell

investigators said they found evidence a 
portion of track shifted before an amtrak train derailed injuring 
95 people 
susan coughlin vice chairwoman of the national transportation 
safety board and dave watson investigator in charge for the ntsb 
said tuesday there were very slight indications of movement 
where the train left the tracks monday 
theres ballast underneath that track and anytime that 
ballast could shift or the soil could become wet ms coughlin 
said its not a static situation out there 
however ms coughlin said we are not in a position at this 
point to interpret any of the findings 
amtraks california zephyr was headed to chicago from the west 
coast with 396 passengers and a crew of 24 when it derailed on 
track owned by the burlington northern railroad 
about a dozen people remained hospitalized tuesday three with 
what ms coughlin said were serious injuries 
an eightmember ntsb team is leading the investigation which 
also involves about 40 officials from the federal railroad 
administration the state transportation department amtrak the 
brotherhood of locomotive engineers and burlington northern 
the fbi also is investigating the possibility of sabotage ms 
coughlin said at a news conference tuesday night the 24member 
crew was tested for drug and alcohol use and those results were 
expected in about two days she said 
she also said it appeared the zephyr had not exceeded the 79 mph 
speed limit 
in addition to checking the stability of the track today 
investigators planned to concentrate on a switching device in 
batavia and a 1240foot stretch of track from where the train 
passed a grade crossing to where it derailed she said 
ms coughlin said a fireman who was a qualified engineer was at 
the controls as the train crossed a grade crossing just south of 
town 
approximately 1500 feet later the fireman who was operating 
as the engineer felt the train drag up to that point they 
detected nothing abnormal in the performance of the train ms 
coughlin said 
he looked back and saw that the rear cars were swaying he put 
his train then into an emergency braking 
ms coughlin declined to say whether braking was the correct 
procedure 
behind the investigators crews went to work on the twisted rail 
and gouged rightofway in this town of 525 people situated 90 
miles southeast of des moines the doubletrack route was not 
expected to reopen until late today

president patricio aylwin has appointed a 
panel to investigate human rights abuses during the rule of gen 
augusto pinochet who has issued warnings about trying to punish 
the military for any violations 
observers believe the groups work could lead to a number of 
rights trials many involving military officers that would set the 
stage for a potentially risky situation for the newly elected 
civilian government however 
the 74yearold general stepped down as president last month but 
remains commanderinchief of the powerful 60000men army 
sheltered by a constitutional clause that prevents aylwin from 
firing him 
there was no immediate comment from pinochet on aylwins 
announcement although he has warned in the past that he would now 
allow any of his men to be touched 
aylwin announced the establishment of the commission for truth 
and reconciliation in a nationwide radio and tv speech tuesday 
night 
the groups investigation will also cover cases of terrorism 
against the pinochet government which seized power in a september 
1973 coup that ousted the elected marxist government of salvador 
allende who died in the uprising 
the commission will issue its findings in a report in six to 
nine months and will be able to recommend moral and material 
compensation for victims of abuse 
rights violations constitute a wound still open in the 
national soul that cannot be heeled by trying to forget said 
alywin 71 who took office on march 11 closing the eyes in the 
face of what has happened would mean to maintain a permanent 
source of pain division hatred and violence in our society 
the commission includes three prominent rightwing lawyers who 
supported pinochet ricardo martin jose luis cea and gonzalo 
vial a former pinochet cabinet minister 
the other members are considered aylwin supporters including 
pablo zalaquet a former president of amnesty international the 
londonbased human rights group raul rettig a former president of

a black man testified he helped supply baseball 
bats to a group of white neighbors just before a black teenager 
was attacked and shot to death in what prosecutors allege was a 
racial slaying 
joseph russell gibbons 21 said tuesday at the murder trial of 
two white men that he and others were carrying bats to defend 
ourselves from the 25 guys who were supposed to come to their 
brooklyn neighborhood that night 
gibbons said he did not see the shooting but shortly afterward 
a white youth came up to him and said joe fama just shot a black 
kid around the corner 
joseph fama the accused triggerman and keith mondello the 
alleged ringleader of the white mob are on trial charged with 
murder in the slaying of yusuf hawkins a black 16yearold 
hawkins and three of his friends all black were set upon by a 
batwielding white mob on the night of aug 23 after traveling to 
bensonhurst to look at a used car prosecutors said hawkins was 
shot in the chest allegedly by fama 19 
the slaying raised racial tensions to a fever pitch in the city 
during its mayoral campaign 
the trial was scheduled to resume today 
in other testimony tuesday luther sylvester one of hawkins 
friends said he and his friends were walking down the street when 
some white boys ran around the corner and surrounded us they 
were shaking their bats saying is this them is this them 
within seconds the high school senior said he heard gunshots 
and saw hawkins on the ground blood flowing from his chest the 
whites fled he said 
sylvester who was not hurt said he saw no gun and could not 
identify any members of the gang 
gibbons who has lived most of his life in the mainly white 
italianamerican neighborhood told the jurors that on the night of 
the attack mondello 19 had come to him for help 
prosecutors say a young woman gina feliciano had threatened to 
bring 25 or more of her black and hispanic friends to her home to 
celebrate her 18th birthday 
keith asked me if i would be there to defend himself because 
gina said she had 20 to 25 black and puerto rican friends coming 
down to trash the store and beat him up gibbons said 
gibbons said that as the whites assembled in a schoolyard and 
outside a candy store his best friend 22yearold charles 
stressler asked him to help carry a box of bats from stresslers 
home he testified he carried the box and put it down outside the 
candy store 
i didnt see who exactly had the bats he said but 
testified that about 30 whites had assembled and about half were 
wielding bats 
six other whites charged in the attack are to be tried later

labor unrest mounted today as 
thousands of workers at the countrys largest shipyard went on 
strike and protests continued to plague a major automaker and the 
staterun broadcast network 
about 20000 union workers at hyundai heavy industries co in 
the southern city of ulsan walked off their jobs demanding the 
release of four union leaders jailed for organizing labor protests 
earlier this year 
kia motors co the nations thirdlargest automaker was 
crippled today when 7000 workers who staged a oneday walkout at 
its plant just outside seoul demanding they be paid for time spent 
on union activity 
the kia union said the company was trying to suppress labor and 
that the union would decide later whether to call a general strike 
kia partly owned by the ford motor co and mazda motors of japan 
produces about 1500 cars a day 
also today a workers protest against the staterun korean 
broadcasting system entered its second week with 5000 of the 
networks 7000 employees demanding the resignation of the systems 
governmentappointed president suh kiwon the workers say suh is 
opposed to reform and stands in the way of greater press freedom 
about 3000 broadcast workers staged a peaceful sixmile march 
through seoul this afternoon 
officials of the hyundai shipyard at ulsan 200 miles southeast 
of seoul called the strike illegal and said they were considering 
a lockout 
news reports said about 3000 police were deployed at the 
shipyard a few hours after hyundai workers began the strike the 
shipyard a subsidiary of the giant hyundai is the nations 
largest with 24000 employees 
a union leader said by telephone that virtually all of the 
unions 20000 members were taking part in the strike 
we have no other choice after lastminute labormanagement 
negotiations broke down said the union official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a hyundai spokesman in seoul said the company would try to 
reopen dialogue with the workers to avert a catastrophic 
development last year thousands of riot police supported by 
helicopters firing tear gas stormed the shipyard to end a bitter 
threemonth strike 
todays strike followed two days of work slowdowns by union 
members demanding the release of four union leaders in jail for 
involvement in what the company called illegal labor activity 
hyundai said the slowdown cost it 10 million in lost production 
the comany said the strike was illegal because it did not go 
through required legal steps including a coolingoff period 
following the breakdown of negotiations union leaders said the 
complexity of labor laws makes it virtually impossible for them to 
stage a lawful strike 
the union was scheduled to begin wage negotiations with the 
company on thursday but workers said the release of the jailed 
union leaders not wages was the subject of the dispute 
at a rally today hyundai workers criticized what they called 
dual government standards in handling labor problems 
they said the government has treated industrial labor protests 
differently than the protest at the staterun korean broadcasting 
system network 
the hyundai workers claimed the government was unfair when it 
kept in jail four of their union leaders while releasing 117 
broadcast workers a day after they were arrested for involvement in 
their labor dispute

nearly a quarter of drug abusers contacted in a 
study said they sold blood plasma to collection centers raising 
questions about whether the nations blood supply is adequately 
protected against the aids virus 
the continued donation of plasma and occasionally blood by 
intravenous drug users is troubling and warrants further 
attention said the study by researchers at the johns hopkins 
school of hygiene and public health in baltimore 
they study was published in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
the aids virus is believed to be spread mainly through sexual 
intercourse shared needles and from infected mothers to their 
babies 
a spokesman for plasma collection centers says they are doing a 
good job of excluding infected drug users and keeping the aids 
virus out of blood products 
these products include clotting factor used by hemophiliacs and 
immune globulin taken by people who need protection against 
hepatitis 
the current products that are out there are considered to be 
100 percent safe said james reilly spokesman for the american 
blood resources association the trade group representing the 
approximately 400 us forprofit plasmacollection centers 
there are no known cases of aids transmission from products 
currently on the market he said in a telephone interview from 
annapolis md 
the study found that more than 23 percent of 2921 intravenous 
drug abusers contacted in the baltimore area in 1988 and 1989 said 
they had sold plasma or donated blood after they began injecting 
drugs 
tests revealed 241 percent of those contacted were infected 
with the aids virus researchers said 
the centers for disease control says 126127 adult aids cases 
had been reported as of march 31 including 26883 cases among 
intravenous drug users and 8711 cases among homosexual intravenous 
drug users transfusion associated aids cases total 3040 
since march 1985 all us blood and blood components have been 
screened to detect aids antibodies which indicate the presence of 
the virus the researchers noted 
in addition plasma from commercial centers is subjected to 
processing designed to kill the aids virus although in isolated 
cases in other countries the virus has survived in treated plasma 
products said dr kenrad e nelson lead researcher 
this does not mean the blood supply is unsafe nelson said 
in a telephone interview but the fact is that there have been 
cases where hemophiliacs have gotten infected despite screening and 
heat treatment i think donor exclusion is vital 
efforts so far have paid off the study found the prevalence of 
aids infections among blood or plasma donors fell from 171 percent 
in 1985 to 36 percent in 198889 
most of the subjects said they were paid 10 to 15 for giving 
plasma and about 10 percent said they had donated blood at 
nonprofit blood banks 
plasma centers are typically storefront operations that pay 
people for giving plasma in a twohour process that separates the 
liquid part of the blood from the cells and returns the cells to 
the body 
nelson said commercial plasma centers should consider no longer 
paying donors in order to further protect the us blood supply 
the approximately 2400 us nonprofit blood banks including 
those run by the american red cross primarily draw whole blood and 
rely entirely on unpaid donors

fell 
dealers said the market was dominated by worries about the 
potential inflationary consequences of west germanys monetary 
union with east germany slated to go into effect july 2 
the concern is pulling the mark down against the swiss franc and 
the yen but is having little impact on dollarmark trading they 
said 
one dealer at a us bank in frankfurt said he expected the 
dollar to move higher in the medium term boosted by relatively 
positive us economic data in recent weeks and deepseated worries 
about german monetary union 
if the gnp figures are good perhaps that could finally give 
the market the impetus to push the dollar higher he said 
dealers said gold is trading at late tuesdays us levels but 
they said there could be some spark in the market later in the day 
or in european dealings thursday 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar rose 110 yen to a closing 15925 yen later in london 
it was quoted at a lower rate of 15915 yen

its only a single faucet by the side 
of a dirt road but its more than the residents of the sunny sky 
subdivision have ever had in their poor neighborhood 
drinking water flowed for the first time tuesday to more than 40 
residents of the colonia the border region is dotted with 
similar communities of plywood homes and trailers without water or 
sewage connections 
after lawyers used the state consumer protection act to go after 
the developer residents gathered tuesday at the spigot to 
celebrate they said they hope one day to have water lines all the 
way to their houses 
this is very good because the children have to be clean to go 
to school said eulalio hernandez a father of six 
socorro de la rosa who has three children smiled as she 
watched the water flow into a plastic bucket lets bathe ms 
de la rosa said as she carried a neighbors laughing 5yearold and 
washed his face in the water 
she said she had worried about people washing with irrigation 
water from the polluted rio grande that flows from pipes near the 
homes at sunny sky 
previously residents of sunny sky had to travel about a mile to 
gather barrels and buckets of water at another colonia that has 
potable water they will continue to use outhouses in their back 
yards 
the water hookup is the work of al alvarez an assistant state 
attorney general 
alvarez used the state deceptive trade practices consumer 
protection act to get a court order that directed residents 
mortgage payments to his office instead of to the developer the 
money went toward water service 
the developer was telling people there would be water hookup 
and soon there would be sewer service alvarez said he never 
intended to do that he knew from the very beginning that this 
would be an illegal subdivision 
the developer never plotted his subdivision or registered it 
with cameron county as required alvarez said 
the developer pete gonzalez jr of brownsville said he 
couldnt get a water permit because of local opposition to his 
lowincome subdivision he also said the plans he tried to submit 
were rejected 
i on my own requested water service but they were never 
promised water said gonzalez who started the development in 
1980 
all im concerned about is the people there im a very caring 
person the allegations they made about me are not correct 
the state collected 3170 in mortgage payments from august 
until october when gonzalez declared bankruptcy tying up 
subsequent payments in bankruptcy court 
the 3170 was used to buy a water line to connect with el 
jardin water supply corp a local knights of columbus group donated 
the final 694 the residents needed to purchase the meter and final 
length of pipe 
alvarez said the consumer protection act has been used about 20 
times to stop colonia developers 
this type of thing makes us feel good about our work said 
vicky guerra an investigator with alvarezs office as she visited 
sunny sky

a year after colt firearms drew praise 
for pulling its ar15 semiautomatic rifle off the civilian market 
it is under fire for producing a new version that critics say is 
virtually the same weapon 
the furor over the gun called the sporter and produced by the 
newly created colts manufacturing co has renewed debate over the 
bush administrations policy on assault weapons 
it also has become a political issue for state officials in 
connecticut which put up 25 million in state pension funds 
earlier this year to help buy colt industries firearms division 
and end a bitter fouryear strike the state now owns 47 percent of 
the new company 
late tuesday in hartford the state house voted 9649 to approve 
a bill requiring permits for assault weapons including the sporter 
rifle the bill imposes a 10year mandatory prison term on anyone 
convicted of using assault weapons in carrying out a violent crime 
supporters of the bill say theyre optimistic that it will be 
passed by the state senate but opponents pledged to bring intense 
pressure on the upper chamber 
this is feelgood legislation said susan misiora a 
lobbyist for the national rifle association it isnt going to do 
anything 
rep robert godfrey one of the bills chief backers said 
chances of getting the bill through the senate were pretty 
good other supporters said it was a first step in getting 
assault weapons often the gun of choice for drug traffickers off 
the streets 
the colt sporter rifle is no different from the ar15 and it 
should be on the list said rep christopher burnham 
colt industries voluntarily stopped producing for the ar15 a 
version of the military m16 assault rifle for the civilian market 
in march 1989 a day after the bush administration halted imports 
of similar weapons 
at the time bush administration drug czar william j bennett 
called colts decision an act of civic responsibility 
last week the new management of colts started shipping the 
sporter a modified version of the ar15 that the company says is 
designed for sportsmen and is not an assault rifle 
there was no immediate comment from richard gamble president of 
colts manufacturing he did not return a telephone call tuesday 
afternoon in interviews last week he maintained that the new gun 
differs substantially from the ar15 
but handgun control inc a washingtonbased group charged that 
the sporter is simply a cosmetically altered ar15 
it is clear that colt is trying to bamboozle the public with 
its claim of producing a new gun handgun control leader sarah 
brady said last week there is no doubt that this gun is an 
assault weapon said the wife of james brady who was wounded in 
the assassination attempt on president reagan 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio agreed with the gun control 
group he said the appearance of the new gun on the market 
highlights the need for a ban on domestic assaultstyle weapons 
in a letter last week brady urged gov william a oneill to 
force colt to stop production of the gun 
the characterization of sporter as an assault weapon is 
particularly troubling for oneill and state treasurer francisco l 
borges supporters of a domestic ban on assault weapons 
the colt management has represented to me that the sporter is 
not an assault weapon borges said i am currently taking every 
step to ascertain the facts 
at the core of the debate between colts and the guncontrol 
advocates is defining an assault rifle 
when the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
permanently banned imports of 43 types of weapons last july it 
defined the weapons as semiautomatic assault rifles 
the features that lead to such a designation include a folding 
stock a night sight a flash suppressor that could hide a 
shooters location at night and prevent the shooter from being 
temporarily blinded by the flash an ability to accept a bayonet a 
pistol grip and a large magazine capacity 
the sporter cannot be fitted with a bayonet cannot easily be 
altered to fire repeatedly as an automatic weapon and comes with 
only a fiveround magazine onefourth the capacity of the ar15s 
susan whitmore of handgun control said that while the sporter is 
sold with only fiveround magazines it can easily accept larger 
ones and like all semiautomatic rifles can be fired as rapidly as 
a shooter can squeeze the trigger 
handgun control also points to a pistol grip that allows the 
sporter to be fired from the hip 
david conover a lobbyist for the nra said the ar15 and the 
sporter are essentially the same gun but the nra doesnt consider 
either of them assault weapons

the justice department investigation of 
payroll practices in the office of walter e fauntroy the district 
of columbias delegate to congress is closed with the government 
declining to prosecute 
fauntroy who is running for mayor issued a statement tuesday 
saying he was pleased that this will no longer have to divert 
attention from the real issues like drug crime and housing 
that are facing our city 
justice department spokesman david runkel said fauntroys 
lawyers were told of the decision monday by the public integrity 
section of the departments criminal division 
the investigation was begun 15 months ago after a report by the 
associated press that thomas john savage son of rep gus savage 
dill had been on fauntroys washington office payroll while 
running for the illinois legislature 
fauntroy said savage had taken unpaid leave while campaigning 
and denied any wrongdoing 
asked whether the decision not to prosecute applied to any 
inquiry into actions by the younger savage runkel said todays 
action applies only to delegate fauntroy he would not elaborate 
fauntroy and runkel declined to answer further questions about 
savages employment 
the congressman will answer no questions today said 
campaign press secretary ivan brandon we just want to get out 
the good news 
after the allegations became public fauntroy said savage had 
worked as midwest coordinator for legislation to grant statehood to 
the district which fauntroy represents as a nonvoting delegate to 
congress savage however said he made few calls and didnt write 
any statehood material he said his time was spent sending out 
statehood material and working around capitol hill 
savage said he had reported for work every day he drew a salary 
he earned 21398 for the period from september 1987 to june 1988 
in an interview with the washington post in march fauntroys 
attorney abbe d lowell said that fauntroy cannot attest that 
thomas savage was at his desk every day he should have been but he 
expects them his employees to be professional and do their jobs 
lowell said that no one had explained what it is that he 
fauntroy has done wrong

an emergency aid package for panama and 
nicaragua will pass the senate easily and president bush will be 
able to sign it soon a democratic senator predicted today 
the appropriations committee gave the presidents drive for 
emergency aid to the two countries a boost late tuesday by 
approving a 720 million economic recovery package 
on a 1514 vote the committee spurned a request by its 
chairman sen robert c byrd to cut the aid to panama and use the 
extra money for a program to help us businesses compete in the 
new markets of eastern europe 
byrd dwva had teamed with sen patrick leahy dvt in 
seeking to provide just 300 million to panama this year and a like 
amount to nicaragua bush had asked for 500 million for panama 
the committee rejected byrds proposal and adopted instead an 
amendment by sen robert kasten rwis boosting the panama figure 
to 420 million the same amount endorsed by the house on april 3 
i predict that the aid package will pass the senate easily 
and the president will be able to sign it into law in a short 
time leahy said today on nbcs today program 
the package swelled to about 34 billion by the addition of 
money for a long list of domestic programs was expected to come up 
for debate in the full senate today 
leahy said the aid to nicaragua probably would be the first 
installment in a lengthy program to rebuild that nations economy 
we are going to have to be committed to nicaragua for as many 
years as we were committed to destroying it with the contra policy 
i suspect that eventually the united states is going to end up 
spending billions of dollars in this tiny country he said 
final passage was being delayed until thursday because some 
senators were traveling to nicaragua for the inauguration of the 
new usbacked president violeta chamorro 
the bill is nearly 1 billion more expensive than the version 
the house approved like the house measure most of the new 
spending would be financed through cuts in this years pentagon 
budget 
among senate addons to the bill were 110 million for the 
census bureau to help complete the lagging 1990 population count 
1658 million to increase head start rolls by an additional 60000 
disadvantaged children 8 million to fight grasshoppers in the 
upper midwest 705 million for the food stamp program and 
additional money for veterans pensions and medical care 
another provision would set aside 10 million to build and staff 
a new us embassy in lithuania should the administration decide 
to formally recognize the independence of the baltic state 
the measure also adds a provision that would allow the district 
of columbia to use local funds to pay for abortions language that 
brought two presidential vetoes last year 
the appropriations committee claimed nearly 28 billion in 
savings from the military budget the first application of a 
peace dividend from lessened eastwest tensions the savings 
included the effects of a freeze on hiring civilian personnel and 
cuts in military construction weapons procurement and research 
but the committee restored 238 million for construction of a 
new army explosives plant in louisiana the home state of 
democratic sen j bennett johnston a panel member the money had 
been deleted in the house version of the bill

investigators examined a damaged section 
of railroad tracks as they sought the cause of a 29car derailment 
that forced an evacuation and fouled an allegheny river tributary 
buffalo amp pittsburgh railroad inc and federal authorities on 
tuesday investigated the wreck which toppled and ruptured tank 
cars sunday 
officials estimated 100000 gallons of crude oil and 10000 
gallons of sodium hydroxide were spilled into buffalo creek a 
popular fishing stream about 45 miles north of pittsburgh much of 
the material burned off or was caught behind emergency dikes but 
an undetermined amount reached the creek authorities said 
damage to the track indicated the first derailed car may have 
jumped the tracks some time before the other 28 did an official 
said 
george cochran an investigator with the national transportation 
safety board told the pittsburgh postgazette that gouges on the 
track bed and rails leading up to the crash site indicated the lead 
car an opentopped hopper may have crashed without the crews 
realizing it 
he refused to speculate on whether such a derailment could have 
caused the 28 other cars to derail 
john bell the railroads vice president and general manager 
said company officials and investigators from the ntsb and the 
federal railroad administration would compare notes today as they 
tried to determine a cause 
well put all the factors together and come up with a 
determination he said in some derailments theres a single 
factor thats responsible nothing like that has come forward 
yet 
results of drug and alcohol tests on the trains twoman crew 
were not yet available bell said 
about 55000 gallons of crude oil remained in four tank cars 
still at the scene tuesday after workers finally extinguished the 
blaze 
authorities planned to allow the roughly 50 people still 
evacuated from the area to return to their homes after the fuel is 
removed from the site possibly today 
the state fish commission said the sodium hydroxide a lyelike 
chemical used to clean drains killed thousands of fish and that 
others caught in the creek may not be safe to eat 
environmental officials tried to assess the threat to drinking 
water supplies downstream 
no sodium hydroxide had reached water plants tuesday in the 
densely populated allegheny river valley said betsy mallison a 
spokeswoman for the state department of environmental resources 
most of the crude oil had burned off she said 
authorities as far downstream as pittsburgh were ordered to test 
river water she said

artillery battles raged today between 
gen michel aouns troops and samir geageas militia setting pine 
forests ablaze as the 3monthold struggle for control of lebanons 
christian enclave flared anew 
police said at least two people were killed and 12 wounded that 
raised the known casualty toll since the fighting began jan 30 to 
at least 896 killed and 2411 wounded most of them civilians 
the fighting in east beirut and other sectors of the 
310squaremile christian enclave north of the capital broke out 
shortly before daybreak 
the exchanges subsided into intermittent mortar and machine gun 
clashes around 830 am but fierce howitzer duels broke out again

on aouns makeshift port at dbaye north of beirut to prevent the 
general from shipping in ammunition for his artillery and heavy 
weapons

britains house of commons has cut the time limit 
on legal abortions from 28 weeks one of the most liberal in the 
western world to 24 
prolife groups had demanded the time limit be cut to 18 weeks 
but the commons in a series of votes tuesday rejected calls to 
set the limit at 18 weeks 20 weeks 22 weeks or 26 weeks or to 
retain the 28week limit 
the lawmakers chose a 24week limit by 409 votes to 152 in a 
free vote meaning legislators could vote according to conscience 
rather than party lines 
the new limit will be written into the human fertilization and 
embryology bill which is expected to become law this year 
the new limit applies in most routine cases but in other votes 
the commons allowed exemptions 
abortions now will not be subject to any time limit if an 
abortion is needed to prevent grave permanent injury to the 
physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or if substantial 
risk exists of the fetus developing into a baby with a serious 
handicap 
on monday the house of commons voted to write into the same 
bill a provision permitting continued research into human embryos 
up to 14 days after conception 
the 28week limit one of the most liberal provisions in the 
western world has been in force since britain first legalized 
abortion in 1967 
virginia bottomley a minister of state at the department of 
health backed the abortion law change she told the commons 
some fetuses of less than 28 weeks gestation which would at one 
time have stood little chance of surviving after birth now have a 
greater chance of survival 
jo richardson the spokeswoman on womens affairs for the 
socialist opposition labor party said the overwhelming majority of 
people in britain particularly women wanted to leave the limit at 
28 weeks 
legislator ann widdecombe a member of the governing 
conservative party and a leading prolife campaigner cited the 
case of a 21weekold aborted fetus that lived for three hours in a 
kidney dish gasping for life at carlisle general hospital in 
northwest england before dying 
to any member of parliament thinking of voting for a limit 
above the 21 weeks it would not have saved the carlisle baby 
she said 
conservative legislator sir bernard braine who supported an 
18week limit said that since the legalization of abortion in 
1967 up to 3 million children had been lost the overwhelming 
majority would have been born fit and healthy he said

a top rightwing leader says 
whites are arming themselves and will retaliate unless nelson 
mandelas african national congress ends its armed resistance a 
newspaper reported today 
also two top anc leaders general secretary alfred nzo and 
national executive committee member joe slovo were scheduled to 
return friday to south africa after decades in exile they will be 
part of an 11man anc delegation that is to hold groundbreaking 
talks may 24 with the whiteled government 
the citizen newspaper quoted afrikaner resistance movement 
leader eugene terreblanche as saying white south africans will 
never accept a black government he said the government is headed 
for collapse that will lead to massive unrest 
we will not allow our people to be murdered it looks to me as 
though the government is on the road to capitulation we are not 
prepared to live under an anc government which will mean chaos 
terreblanche was quoted as saying 
president fw de klerk has expressed concern about rightwing 
groups that are arming themselves to oppose power sharing with the 
nations black majority terreblanche and other extremist leaders 
are forming commandos of armed followers to resist the end of 
whiteminority rule 
the minister of law and order adriaan vlok told parliament on 
tuesday that the government was concerned about rightists 
unleashing violence he said some armed rightwing groups were 
randomly threatening blacks 
we must take care that we do not allow organizations to be 
created that will lead to bloodshed vlok said 
vlok said police officers would not be allowed to join political 
parties or groups government officials are concerned that some 
members of the security forces support extreme rightwing groups 
terreblanche said the anc must abandon its armed struggle 
against apartheid and the whiteminority government mandela has 
refused to end the armed struggle even though the groups 
guerrilla activities have virtually ended 
my message to anc is that if it persists with its armed 
struggle we will meet it head on terreblanche was quoted as 
saying by the citizen 
terreblanche claimed his group was organizing armed white 
defense units in towns across south africa he said the armed 
groups were ready to step in and impose order if the police and the 
government lose control 
terreblanches movement is thought to number a few thousand 
activists but government officials are concerned that heavily 
armed extreme rightwing groups could pose a serious threat to 
stability if they resort to violence 
several air force troopers were arrested in pretoria last week 
on charges of helping an extremist white group steal dozens of 
assault weapons and pistols from a military installation 
the rightists oppose de klerks plans to end whiteminority rule 
and share political power with the black majority rightists claim 
whites are superior to blacks and the two groups cannot live 
together 
de klerk is to meet with mandela and other anc leaders on may 2 
to try to clear the way for fullscale constitutional talks on 
ending white rule 
in another development police said today that two police 
officers and four protesters were injured in clashes in various 
parts of the country when officers used shotguns tear gas and 
rubber bullets to disperse protesters 
police who gave few details said 48 protesters were arrested

twentynine princeton students occupied 
the university presidents office today in a takeover aimed at 
forcing the school to offer more counseling for victims of sexual 
assault and harassment 
the students invaded president harold shapiros office shortly 
before 9 am tuesday shapiro left his nassau hall office shortly 
after the students entered 
we dont know how long this is going to go on weve stated 
our demands protester antonia merzon said over a portable radio 
talks between the students and university officials were at a 
stalemate but student spokesman matthew polly said another meeting 
was planned 
officials said they had no immediate plans to remove the 
students but that they could not bow to pressure and increase 
funding for a program in the middle of the school year 
school spokeswoman jacquelyn savani said the students names 
were recorded and the university planned to discipline them if 
they end their occupation today they probably will just get a 
warning but they might be suspended if they continue she said 
the students are demanding two fulltime counselors at a center 
for victims of sexual assault or harassment currently there is one 
fulltime and one parttime counselor 
the students argue that from the 198788 to the 198889 school 
year the number of students seeking counseling at the center 
increased from fewer than 50 to 208 
harassment and assault issues are not being taken seriously by 
the university said a woman holed up in shapiros office she 
was interviewed via a walkie talkie radio and refused to identify 
herself except to say that she is a sexual assault victim 
i think its both sad and very counterproductive the 
university cannot respond and make decisions on this kind of 
basis princeton vice president thomas wright said of the sitin

the bush administration is ruling out any 
immediate warming of relations with syria despite a courtesy call 
by president bush and an official pat on the back for assisting in 
the liberation of us hostage robert polhill 
while syria has taken certain positive steps since 1986 to 
combat terrorism including its role in the release of mr polhill 
we continue to be very concerned about the presence in syria and 
syriacontrolled areas of terrorist groups state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said tuesday 
the groups include ahmed jabrils popular front for the 
liberation of palestine general command suspected in the bombing 
of pan am flight 103 in december 1988 in which 270 people were 
killed the japanese red army and the abu nidal organization ms 
tutwiler said the first has its headquarters in damascus the 
other two are in the bekka valley of lebanon 
syrias current relations with these groups is an impediment 
to better ussyrian relations the spokeswoman said 
president bush telephoned president hafez assad on monday to 
express appreciation for syrias participation in the release of 
polhill on sunday after 39 months in captivity 
evidently that personal gesture was the extent of any us move 
toward damascus although ms tutwiler said economic sanctions 
imposed by the reagan administration in 1986 were under 
continuing review 
the sanctions include a ban on certain bank credits a 
suspension of commercial flights between the two countries and a 
travel advisory cautioning americans against going to the middle 
eastern country 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush told 
congressional leaders tuesday that he believes syria had more 
than a passing role in the hostage release 
meeting with the leaders in the cabinet room mostly to discuss 
lithuania the president reiterated that goodwill begets 
goodwill fitzwater said but he said bush added we cannot 
chip away at this problem on an incremental basis we want the 
release of all hostages 
the spokesman did not say what syria had actually done to help 
polhill he also hedged on whether iran helped as well and ruled 
out restoring us ties to iran after a 10year lapse unless the 
seven other captive americans in lebanon are freed 
fitzwater quoted bush as saying he thought iran understood our 
gratitude for any help they may have provided in the hostage 
release but they also know that the process of normalization 
cannot occur until all hostages are released 
other us officials told the associated press on monday that 
iran and syria would remain on the state departments list of 
countries that sponsor terrorism 
in the course of polhills release syria informed the united 
states that its ally iran also helped no details were provided 
to support the claim 
at the white house spokesman fitzwater was asked if there were 
any indications that another hostage would be released 
i think the most honest answer at this point has to be no 
although there are some encouraging rumblings he replied 
however a shiite moslem leader in lebanon today accused the 
united states of responding to the release polhill with ill will 
and urged proiranian shiite moslem militants to continue holding 
their captives 
hussein musawi who played a key role in polhills release 
sunday complained that a house of representatives resolution 
tuesday endorsing a united jerusalem as israels capital 
complicated efforts to release another american hostage the 
moslems in lebanon offered a rose only to get a stone thrown on 
them musawi told a group of visiting western journalists 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine which freed 
polhill is believed by the state department to be holding two 
other americans jesse turner and alann steen the islamic jihad 
meanwhile has terry a anderson and thomas m sutherland captive 
the revolutionary justice organization is holding joseph j 
cicippio and edward a tracy 
all three groups are considered by the state department to be 
within the hezbollah umbrella under iranian influence and composed 
of militant shiite moslems 
the seventh hostage frank h reed is held by arab 
revolutionary cells a prolibyan group with ties also to iran a 
department official said 
two other american hostages were killed in captivity william 
buckley held by the islamic jihad was reported murdered in 1985 
and marine lt col william higgins who was kidnapped by the 
organization of the oppressed of the earth was reported hanged 
last year

police searched today for two gunmen who killed a 
leading opponent of irans islamic government in a geneva suburb 
but there were concerns the suspects might have already fled the 
country 
the rental car used by the assailants was found tuesday evening 
at a parking lot near the geneva airport shortly after the 
departure of a direct iran air flight to tehran said maurice 
gehri a police spokesman 
kazem rajavi 56 who publicized iranian human rights 
violations died instantly around noon tuesday when his car was 
sprayed with gunfire in the lake geneva town of coppet seven miles 
east of geneva police said 
rajavi was driving to his home in the nearby town of tannay when 
his car was blocked by another vehicle and one of the two 
occupants opened fire with a 9mm bmachine gun police said 
gehri said police found 12 shells at the site of the shooting 
the car used by the assailants had been rented on sunday by two 
men who showed foreign identity papers gehri said he refused to 
specify what kind of identity papers the men had presented to the 
rental agency 
a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
killing appeared to be politically motivated he said that tracking 
down the suspects in such cases is particularly difficult 
the source noted that swiss police have not captured the gunmen 
who killed an iranian air force defector three years ago in geneva 
rajavi was the brother of massoud rajavi leader of the leftist 
mujahedeen khalq resistance movement the victim was the mujahedeen 
khalqs geneva representative and served as a lobbyist to the 
council of europe in strasbourg france and genevabased 
international organizations 
he often appealed to un representatives to investigate irans 
rights situation and held several news conferences during a 
februarymarch session of the un human rights commission 
during that session he denounced as a whitewash a largely 
inconclusive report on the situation in iran released by a special 
investigator reynaldo galindo pohl appointed by the commission 
pohls report listed the names of 700 people allegedly executed 
by iran but also listed 39 people believed killed by the 
mujahedeen the report also cited evidence of torture and other 
violations along with government denials 
in a statement issued from their headquarters in baghdad iraq 
the mujahedeen khalq charged that rajavis killing was ordered by 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
it further alleged that the attack was coordinated by sirous 
nasseri the head of the iranian mission to the united nations in 
geneva 
nasseri and the terrorists accompanying him during the 
february session of the un human rights commission repeatedly 
threatened to assassinate dr rajavi who was actively engaged 
in the disclosure of the shameful contents of galindo pohls 
report the statement said 
nasseri was not immediatedly available for comment a mission 
aide who declined to give her name said he was not there 
rajavi broke with the tehran government in 1980 after serving 
briefly as head of the iranian mission to the united nations in 
geneva 
he had been an opponent of irans deposed shah mohammed reza 
pahlavi and lived in switzerland with his frenchborn wife and 
three children for almost 20 years he was granted political asylum 
in 1973 
the mujahedeen were first allied with ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini in the struggle to topple the late shah but in 198081 a 
year after khomeini took power he turned on the group and other 
leftist factions killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of 
people 
the mujahedeen and their military wing the national liberation 
army receive training and support from iraq 
the group is estimated to have 20000 fighters

hundreds of tibetan monks have walked out of 
their monasteries to protest a move by chinese authorities to expel 
some of their proindependence colleagues a tibet monitoring 
organization reported today 
the londonbased tibet information network said about 200 monks 
at the sera monastery and a large number at the drepung 
monastery in the tibetan capital of lhasa staged the walkout last 
week after chinese authorities expelled dozens of monks for 
advocating tibetan independence 
efforts to reach the monasteries and offices in lhasa to confirm 
the report were unsuccessful chinese telephone operators often do 
not connect calls to the remote himalayan region 
lhasa remains under martial law imposed in march 1989 after 
nationalist riots and no journalists have been allowed in recently 
the tibet information network said a witness in lhasa whom it 
did not identify reported that the monks at the sera monastery 
posted a notice on their gate on april 19 announcing the walkout 
the notice said chinese authorities had expelled three monks 
from sera on april 16 and otherwise interfered in monastery 
operations it declared that tibet was an independent country and 
the chinese should leave 
an unspecified number of monks at the nearby drepung monastery 
walked out on april 17 to protest the expulsion of 37 of their 
colleagues the day before the network said it quoted an 
unidentified witness as saying that only older monks too weak to 
travel stayed behind 
the protesting monks are believed to have returned to their home 
villages 
chinese authorities also expelled 18 monks from the ganden 
monastery outside lhasa and seven from the jokhang temple lhasas 
oldest and holiest religious site the network said it said it 
received unconfirmed reports that more than 150 nuns were expelled 
at about the same time from four nunneries around lhasa 
buddhist nuns and monks have led repeated independence 
demonstrations in recent years and remain loyal to their top 
religious leader the exiled dalai lama from india where he fled 
in 1959 after a failed tibetan uprising the dalai lama has 
criticized chinas heavyhanded rule in tibet and appealed for 
autonomy or independence 
china insists that its sovereignty over tibet dates back to the 
13th century and refuses to accept any weakening of its control 
however there were long periods when tibet had virtually no 
contact with china and was ruled by a theocracy headed by the dalai 
lama 
in the 1950s and 1960s the communists destroyed most of tibets 
monasteries and banned religious worship only in the past decade 
have some temples and monasteries been reopened 
four times since late 1987 tibetan independence protests have 
resulted in bloody clashes with security forces since the last 
protests culminated in riots march 58 1989 chinese authorities 
have stationed security forces in all the monasteries and begun 
intensive political education of monks and nuns

the meeting follows an agreement by west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and east germanys prime minister lothar de maiziere 
on a goal of completing monetarbreak the breeding cycle 
the last medfly infestation in south florida was in 1987 when 
five males were found the states last major outbreak affecting 
commercial groves spread across 28 counties in 1956 
environmentalists in california and here have objected to use of 
malathion contending too little is known about the chemicals 
longterm health effects 
the bad thing about using these kinds of chemicals is that 
they wipe out all of the insects in an area the good and the 
bad said lee emerson a member of the sierra club its not 
the kind of balanced environmentally sensitive approach we should 
be taking these days 
joette lorion a miami coordinator of earth day said if its 
a danger to your car and theyre asking you to wipe it off it must 
be a danger to your body 
the mixture of malathion and syrupy bait can damage car paint if 
not rinsed off quickly 
officials also said that people with health problems such as 
asthma or allergies may want to remain indoors during the 
spraying but conner said of malathion it has not been 
determined anywhere to be a health risk 
medflies could strike a harsh blow to floridas citrus industry 
which was crippled by a christmas freeze medfly larvae hatch 
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables turning 
them into mush 
bobby mckown executive vice president of florida citrus mutual 
in lakeland said monday the 12000member growers organization 
supports immediate action to control and eradicate the medflies 
so they dont expand beyond residential areas 
the pesticide to be sprayed per acre consists of 24 ounces of 
malathion mixed with sticky bait malathion is used in a stronger 
concentration of 31 ounces per acre throughout florida for

the head of the leading proisrael lobby in 
washington is critical of the israeli governments secret financing 
of jewish housing in the christian sector of jerusalem according 
to sources 
through an emissary to prime minister yitzhak shamir thomas a 
dine executive director of the american israel public affairs 
committee aipac questioned the timing of the move into the 
christian quarter of east jerusalem 
he told shamir the israeli government was doing great harm 
to israels standing with the bush administration and the american 
public sources familiar with the criticism told the associated 
press 
although american jewish groups frequently disagree on a wide 
range of issues it is unusual for aipac objections to israeli 
government action to become known publicly 
another jewish group the antidefamation league also 
criticized the israeli government this official support given to 
jewish settlers only serves to disrupt the status quo and gives 
ammunition to those wishing to upset the religious harmony in the 
holy city the adl statement said 
the state department on monday sharply criticized the israeli 
government for financing the purchase of a sublease on a 
churchowned hospice to be rented to new soviet jewish immigrants 
about 150 jews two weeks ago moved on to the site 
israeli courts have ordered the jews evicted a decision the 
bush administration welcomed removal of the settlers has been 
blocked by appeals the supreme court has ruled that they can stay 
at least until the next court hearing thursday 
dine called the move a provocation said the sources who 
provided information about dines statements only on condition that 
they not be identified 
the assertion paralleled the state departments description of 
the purchase as an insensitive and provocative action 
the israeli housing ministry controlled by shamirs hardline 
likud coalition contributed about 40 percent of the 16 million 
purchase of the sublease on the property owned by the greek 
orthodox church 
the ministry for two weeks had denied financing the deal before 
admitting it 
congress has been considering guaranteeing a 400 million loan 
to help resettle soviet jews in israel the bush administration has 
conditioned its support for the legislation now before the senate 
on a condition that israel not use the money to house soviet jews 
in the predominantly arab sector of jerusalem or on the west bank 
and gaza strip territories occupied in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said this week 
the assurances had not been received yet but she noted the 
legislation was still pending and that israel was in the midst of 
trying to form a new government 
none of the 12 billion in annual us economic aid to israel 
is supposed to be used to help jews living on the west bank or in 
gaza the bush administration takes the position their settling the 
area poses an obstacle to peace with the arabs president bush last 
month called on israel not to settle soviet immigrants in east 
jerusalem as well 
the aipac lobby over the years has demonstrated great strength 
in congress and forged winning coalitions among democrats and 
republicans to defeat several american arms sales to arab countries 
confronting israel

in a fresh burst of settlement 
activity a crane hoisted seven mobile homes onto a rocky hilltop 
in the judean desert today setting up the core of a new jewish 
community in the occupied west bank 
the founding of alon was the latest move in a campaign that has 
gained momentum since march when prime minister yitzhak shamir took 
the reins of a caretaker government without the leftofcenter 
labor party which opposes settlement building 
several settler leaders including rabbi moshe levinger and 
pinchas wallerstein watched as bulldozers smoothed the rocky 
ground for the mobile homes 
new residents of alon which overlooks the jordan valley 10 
miles east of jerusalem raised wine glasses in a toast 
in five years there will be a big city here said eliyakim 
haetzni a parliament member for the prosettlement tehiya party as 
he pointed to the surrounding barren hills in a sweeping gesture 
haetzni criticized the us government which has opposed 
settlement building on territory captured from the arab states 
including east jerusalem president bush has said such settlements 
impede efforts to arrange peace talks with palestinians 
there are many shades of antisemitism some are very 
civilized such as calling settlements an obstacle to peace 
haetzni said 
moshe waysman leader of the alon settlers said 10 families and 
a few bachelors would move onto the stateowned land at alon today 
and that six more mobile homes would be added in the next few days 
waysman said the group had no political aspirations even though 
it was being assisted by amana the settlement wing of the 
nationalistic gush emunim block of faithful settler movement 
we want to live together in a pleasant environment to have 
some land around our houses and to have a higher standard of 
living said waysman who owns a food processing factory in 
jerusalem and immigrated to israel from australia 19 years ago 
alon is not included in the coalition agreement of the collapsed 
likudlabor government which called for eight new settlements to 
be built by 1992 
shamir spokesman avi pazner said the construction did not 
violate the agreement because alon was merely an expansion of the 
existing settlement of kfar adumim 
this government has not adopted any new resolutions regarding 
settlements and only follows what was decided by the national unity 
government he said

anticommunist demonstrators demanding 
the resignation of interim president ion iliescu thronged a central 
square today and the government threatened to break up the protest 
nearly 1000 people crowded university square by early afternoon 
in a continuation of the roundtheclock protest that began sunday 
the protest was interrupted briefly early tuesday when riot police 
moved in 
antiiliescu protesters also gathered in several other romanian 
cities unconfirmed reports said but details were not immediately 
available 
organizers of the bucharest rally claim iliescu a former 
communist party official continues to believe in communism despite 
assertions to the contrary the organizers say they do not belong 
to a political party 
the communist party collapsed in the bloody december revolution 
that swept dictator nicolae ceausescu from power iliescu who 
became a ceausescu critic in recent years helped form the national 
salvation front which dominates the interim government 
the vice president of the front nicolae s dumitru told a news 
conference today that the antiiliescu demonstration was a 
subversive rightwing diversion the government has tried to 
be patient but it will order the demonstration broken up if it 
spreads dumitru said 
on the square groups of antiiliescu protesters said they 
feared that ballotrigging would occur in elections planned for may 
20 
parliament has managed things so that the front will win the 
elections said one woman heatedly 
if the national salvation front gets hold of power we have a 
disaster on our hands argued a man who held sway over another 
small group of protesters 
critics of iliescu say the front is led by unrepentant 
communists seeking to reestablish their partys rule 
also today a human rights group said there was concern that 
iliescus national salvation front had an undue advantage over 
other political groups readying for the elections 
the international human rights law group a washingtonbased 
rights monitoring organization said people fear the front 
because of its pervasive relationship with the government has 
greater access than other parties to money the media and 
factories 
the statement issued in bucharest noted widespread 
complaints that newspapers critical of the frontdominated 
government were regularly deprived of newsprint and printing 
facilities while state television was biased in favor of the 
government 
the group also said they heard reports of violence and 
intimidation by front supporters against the opposition

egypt and jordan said today that a 
resolution by the us house of representatives endorsing a united 
jerusalem as israels capital complicates middle east peace efforts 
the cairo representative of the palestine liberation 
organization also condemned the nonbinding resolution which was 
overwhelmingly approved by the house on tuesday by a vote of 378 to 
34 
in beirut lebanon a shiite moslem leader said the vote will 
hinder efforts to release another american hostage 
hussein musawi who some believe played a key role in robert 
polhills release on sunday said he hoped no other hostage would 
be freed after such a monumental illintentioned american 
response 
a statement by the egyptian foreign ministry voiced extreme 
concern at the passage of the us resolution which differed 
with the bush administrations official position that jerusalems 
status must be determined through negotiations among all parties 
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing it from jordan in 
the 1967 war with the arabs and declared the united city holy to 
christians jews and moslems as its eternal capital 
the arabs and most world nations including the united states 
do not recognize jerusalem as israels capital 
egypt affirms that adopting such resolutions which lack a 
legal basis and ignore basic human rights does not help in solving 
the present problems in the region but further complicates them 
the ministry statement said 
egypt the only arab state having a peace treaty with israel 
said attempts to solve regional hostilities should take into 
account the interests and rights of the various parties 
jordans foreign minister marwan kassem said the vote gives 
israel the excuse and the legitimacy to continue its aggression 
against arabs the vote will harm the us reputation as a 
peacemaker in the region kassem said in a statement in amman 
the jordanian capital 
the congressional vote came despite arguments by opponents that 
the resolution would cause resentment among the arab states 
the resolution was identical to one adpted march 22 by the 
senate 
president hosni mubarak today sent a letter to president bush 
about recent middle east developments including the situation in 
jerusalem and the various views on it the state middle east news 
agency said 
zohdi alkodra the cairo plo representative said congress does 
not have the right to determine the status of jerusalem just as 
no country in the world has the right to dertermine the status of 
washington or new york 
in comments reported by the middle east news agency alkodra 
said jerusalem would always be the capital of a palestinian state 
and that the palestinian people would continue their struggle until 
they formed their state

president hafez assad of syria will visit 
moscow at the end of the month his first trip to the soviet union 
in three years official damascus radio reported today 
assads visit comes amid a significant shift in moscows 
relations with syria its closest arab ally and a reported cutback 
in aid 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and efforts to 
establish better relations with the west have carried over to the 
middle east moscow has been edging closer to israel and is urging 
radical arab states such as syria to moderate their stand and 
support the middle east peace process 
the exact date of assads visit was not announced and no other 
details on it were available 
the announcement said that in response to an official 
invitation by soviet president mikhail gorbachev president assad 
will undertake a working visit to the ussr at the end of 
april 
the radio said the invitation was delivered to assad by soviet 
officials who visited damascus the syrian capital last month 
the visit will be assads first to moscow since april 1987 
the syrian announcement gave no hint about what will be on 
assads agenda in moscow 
but the syrian leader who has been in power since 1970 last 
month decried the reformist wave sweeping eastern europe as a boon 
to israel and called for a holy war as long as time against the 
jewish state as the eastern european countries adopt democratic 
reforms they are improving their ties with israel 
he also denounced soviet jewish emigration to israel reflecting 
growing arab fears that tens of thousands of jews will settle in 
israel in the next few years and set back the fragile middle east 
peace process arab countries fear that many new arrivals will be 
settled in occupied territories where the palestine liberation 
organization wants to form its own state 
the expected influx of soviet jews follows moscows relaxation 
of travel restrictions 
despite his criticism assad stressed in his march 8 speech 
marking the ruling baath socialist partys 27th anniversary in 
power that the relationship between syria and the soviet union is 
as firm as ever 
however the soviets have been stressing to assad that he 
abandon his drive for strategic parity with israel and have reduced 
the volume of advanced weapons it had traditionally supplied 
damascus 
western military analysts and diplomats say this cutback for 
economic as well as political reasons has forced the syrians who 
have severe economic problems of their own to look elsewhere for 
military hardware

a shiite moslem leader today accused the 
united states of responding to the release of an american hostage 
with ill will and urged proiranian shiite moslem militants to 
continue holding their captives 
hussein musawi who is believed to have played a key role in 
robert polhills release sunday complained that a us house of 
representatives resolution tuesday endorsing a united jerusalem as 
israels capital complicated efforts to release another american 
hostage 
the moslems in lebanon offered a rose only to get a stone 
thrown on them musawi told a group of visiting western 
journalists including the associated press 
he said the united states intentions were demonstrated by the 
congressional resolution which is nonbinding musawi said the 
hostageholders have been repeatedly urged to prove goodwill by 
freeing a captive 
so they did and released polhill he said 
but upon that release we heard the news of the house of 
representatives resolution on jerusalem if every release will be 
matched by such a monumental illintentioned american response why 
then should any hostage be freed 
we hope that no other hostage will be released said musawi 
reputed mentor of islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
the group that held polhill and continues to hold two other 
american educators 
sundays release of polhill after 39 months in captivity raised 
hopes that another western hostage could be freed kidnappers are 
believed to be holding 17 western hostages including seven 
americans 
asked about persistent reports that a second american hostage 
would be released during eid alfitr the threeday feast that 
begins thursday to mark the end of islams holy fasting month of 
ramadan musawi said 
there is plenty of talk about such a move i dont think eid 
alfitr means anything to the americans and i dont think theres 
an atmosphere of such an early release 
musawi said the release of lebanese and palestinian prisoners 
held by israel and its militia ally the south lebanon army was 
essential for any progress toward freeing the remaining 
westerners 
the release of the prisoners with israel and its surrogates is 
a foremost issue and should be simultaneous with the release of the 
hostages he said 
meanwhile the leader of the south lebanon army canceled plans 
for a holiday prisoner release because of publicity linking such a 
move to western hostages sources said today 
antoine lahad a retired lebanese army general who heads the 
2500member force refused to act on amnesty requests from the 
prisoners families he had allowed releases for the past two years 
to mark the end of the ramadan holiday 
his army holds 300 mostly shiite moslems in the alkhiam jail 
just north of the israel border 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said lahads 
decision was affected by publicity suggesting the release would be 
a concession to the proiranian hezbollah which is believed to be 
linked to groups holding hostages in lebanon 
israel radio quoted lahad as saying the release was turned into 
an international affair for no reason 
to my regret there will be no releases this year because of 
the press and president bush he was quoted as saying by the 
radio releasing them now would be seen as an american payment to 
the hezbollah through israeli agents 
the south lebanon army said tuesday that four lebanese had been 
freed after being investigated on suspicion of belonging to a 
terror group sources close to the army said the release took place 
last week and was unrelated to the holiday or the release of 
polhill 
south lebanon army sources had said earlier that they expected 
lahad to free 10 or 11 prisoners for the holiday and a report in 
london suggested more than 30 would be allowed to go home 
israel radio said shiites in southern lebanon were 
embittered by lahads decision 
in damascus syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa received a 
letter tuesday night from his iranian counterpart foreign minister 
ali akbar velayati the official syrian news agency reported today 
officials did not disclose the contents of velayatis letter 
beyond saying it dealt with developments in lebanon and the middle 
east velayati said monday that information from lebanon indicated 
another western hostage could be released within days 
iran has demanded goodwill gestures such as the release of arab 
prisoners held by israel and its militia ally as a way to encourage 
further hostage releases israel holds about 9200 palestinians in 
connection with the 28monthold uprising against israeli 
occupation 
shiite militants also have demanded the release of 15 radicals 
imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies in 
kuwait in 1983 before making another goodwill gesture beiruts 
independent annahar daily said tuesday 
in tehran irans radical parliament speaker mehdi karrubi 
said today us officials were more spiteful of the islamic 
republic now than when washington launched a failed military 
operation in april 1980 to free 52 us hostages in tehran 
polhill 55 of new york and fellow us educators jesse turner 
of boise idaho and alann steen of boston were abducted in beirut 
on jan 24 1987 by a group known as islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine 
polhill who was taken to wiesbaden west germany after his 
release underwent more questioning today about his three years in 
captivity and about other western hostages possibly held in the 
same building he was expected to leave for the united states on 
thursday 
in addition to turner and steen kidnappers in lebanon are 
believed to be holding five other americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss an italian and an irishman 
the longestheld hostage is american terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985

john f kennedy may have been fondly remembered 
as a president by many people but to his successor president 
lyndon b johnson he was a joe college man who never had a 
clue as a congressman 
in a vitriolic 1965 interview with historian william e 
leuchtenburg lbj also derided franklin d roosevelts new deal 
ripped the credibility of the new york times and the washington 
post and claimed his administration was the most productive in 
us history 
excerpts of the previously unpublished interview appear in the 
mayjune issue of american heritage magazine 
johnson speaking of fdrs new deal compared the fourterm 
president to the fellow who cut cordwood and sold it all at 
christmas and then spent it all on fireworks it all went up in a 
bang 
he did get things done there was regulation of business but 
that was unimportant said johnson he said social security and 
labor law changes amounted to something but none of it compares 
to my education act 
as to kennedy his running mate just five years earlier lbj 
asserted that no man knew less about congress than john kennedy 
kennedy was in the house of representatives in 194753 but 
johnson said his mentor house speaker sam rayburn never knew 
kennedy 
the only way rayburn thought of him at all was as a very young 
man who might be going to die of malaria he was a joe college man 
and congress felt that he didnt know where the ball was 
johnson said 
kennedy contracted malaria during world war ii 
leuchtenburg says he spent 90 minutes with lbj asking just two 
questions during the lengthy harangue and emerged from the white 
house meeting stunned by the presidents egomania 
but he had agreed before the interview not to quote lbj directly 
until the presidents term was finished and the historian says 
deputy press secretary e hayes redmon told him 95 percent of the 
interview could not be used especially about kennedy 
while johnson was negative about roosevelts new deal he sang 
the praises of his own great society when leuchtenburg suggested 
the thencurrent congress was arguably the most significant in 
history lbj quickly cut him off 
no it isnt its not arguable not if you can read 
johnson said you can perform a great service if you say that 
never before have the three independent branches been so 
productive never has the american system worked so effectively in 
producing quality legislation 
johnson went on to attack the media singling out the times and 
the post 
when i came on as president the times said one thing sure to 
happen is that we would have a closer election in 1964 if the 
livelihood of the new york times depended on its accuracy they 
would be shot at sunrise said johnson 
one day last week the washington post had eleven lies they 
talk about wellinformed sources that just means what they want to 
say said johnson someday well pass a law stopping them from 
using wellinformed

the wife of american hostage alann steen today 
denied a published report that freed hostage robert polhill had 
told her that her husband was beaten after a failed escape attempt 
in 1987 
i have no idea where this is coming from virginia rose 
steen said in a telephone interview from her home in clark lake 
mich she spoke after todays boston herald quoted her 
brotherinlaw craig steen as saying that polhill had discussed 
the reputed escape attempt with her 
craig steen was quoted as saying that mrs steen was told that 
her husband had escaped from his captors in 1987 and that he also 
was seriously ill for a time after his capture 
when youre captured by an enemy in a declared war anyway 
one of your primary jobs is to try to escape steen said 
evidently he saw an opportunity and went for it 
mrs steen said she talked to polhill by telephone from 
wiesbaden west germany just a couple of minutes monday the 
day after he was freed by moslem extremists after 39 months in 
captivity in lebanon they didnt get much chance to discuss 
specifics she said 
we did not talk about that about the kidnapping stuff she 
said 
she said she and her husband had been good friends of polhill 
and his wife since 1983 
it was wonderful to find out how good polhills spirit is 
hes a wonderful brilliant man he said alann was ok when he 
left 
polhill steen and a third hostage jesse turner were 
colleagues at beirut university college when there were kidnapped 
in january 1987 mrs steen said polhill had told her that the 
three had stayed together throughout their 39 months in captivity 
craig steen did not immediately return a telephone call to his 
home in orlando fla seeking further comment 
newsweek reported in november 1988 that steen had escaped but 
was recognized quickly in a beirut suburb and recaptured 
reportedly he was beaten so badly after his recapture that fillings 
were knocked from his teeth newsweek attributed its story to 
anonymous sources 
mrs steen said she was aware of the newsweek report 
craig steen was quoted as saying that virginia talked to 
polhill himself and she gave me some information but he asked 
that the other things that he told her not be released until he is

lithuania is urgently seeking direct trade links 
with soviet regions and factories as a way around the kremlins 
suffocating economic blockade a spokesman for the baltic states 
parliament said today 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene of lithuania is proposing 
the direct links in the hope that regional leaders sympathetic to 
the secessionist republic will come to its aid spokesman paul 
pauparus said 
the kremlin began cutting off natural gas oil and other 
supplies to lithuania one week ago stepping up its pressure on the 
republics leaders to rescind laws promoting their march 11 
independence decree 
lithuanias economy is on the brink of collapse the soviet 
newspaper selskaya zhizn or rural life reported today 
lithuanias parliament set up a special antiblockade 
commission tuesday naming prunskiene as its head she has sought 
economic aid from several european countries but has reported 
little success 
lithuanian officials have estimated that the republic can only 
hold out about two to four weeks without fuel from the soviet 
union its sole supplier 
pauparus said democrats who have come to power in moscow and 
leningrad as well as other regions might be willing to deal with 
lithuania but their supplies might not be able to reach the 
republic along kremlincontrolled train and truck routes 
some lithuanians have suggested that the republic which 
produces more meat and milk than it consumes could trade those 
items for needed supplies 
eduardas potashinskas a lithuanian activist who monitored 
todays parliament session said speakers announced that the 
kremlin decreed a stop tuesday to soviet supplies of paper and wood 
products to lithuania 
the kremlin has barred western correspondents from lithuania 
although it allowed about two dozen journalists to visit its 
capital vilnius last weekend 
the kgb said on tuesday that it had reinforced its units on the 
lithuanian border and increased patrols offshore 
lt anatoly parakhin of the kgb whose forces are responsible 
for soviet borders did not specify in a moscow briefing what goods 
the secret police were looking for but he indicated weapons were 
on the list 
control has been established over possible contacts between 
soviet and foreign ships in territorial waters and within the 
borders of the economic zone of the ussr to avert the transfer 
of weapons and ammunition to lithuania parakhin was quoted by 
tass as saying 
the movement through the border of all cargo and means of 
transportation is being most carefully controlled he said 
he said the steppedup control was justified by the discovery on 
april 12 of 240000 rounds of hunting ammunition aboard the soviet 
ship marat kozlov which was sailing to lithuania from west 
germany tass said 
pauparus contended the load of hunting ammunition was a normal 
annual shipment and said the kgb implication of something sinister 
was nonsense 
he also denounced a tass report that a shot had been fired at an 
army barracks in vilnius on monday night the shot came through an 
open window and shattered an opposite window injuring no one the 
staterun soviet news agency reported 
this is once again a provocation or nonsense pauparus said 
on tuesday lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis denounced 
the united states for failing to impose economic sanctions in 
retaliation for the embargo 
can the freedom of one group of people be sold for the freedom 
of another what then is the idea of freedom itself the 
lithuanian leader said in a statement released by his press office 
in vilnius the republics capital 
this is another munich landsbergis said referring to 
french and british appeasement of nazi germany that culminated in 
the 1938 munich pact that sacrificed much of czechoslovakia to 
germany 
secretary of state james a baker iii said today that the soviet 
union must allow lithuanians to exercise selfdetermination 
but baker told a senate appropriations subcommittee in 
washington that the bush administration still was not prepared to 
impose economic sanctions on moscow to force negotiations with 
lithuanian leaders 
the soviet union forcibly annexed lithuania in 1940 along with 
the other two baltic states latvia and estonia 
a lithuanian delegation remained in moscow today trying for a 
second day to meet with kremlin officials but the republics 
representation in the soviet capital said no meetings had been set 
as of this morning 
mikhail s gorbachev and his advisers have repeatedly rebuffed 
lithuanian attempts to discuss a possible solution to the crisis 
the soviet president has demanded that the lithuanians first 
declare themselves willing to adhere to the soviet constitution 
which calls for a referendum on secession and a waiting period of 
up to five years 
premier nikolai ryzhkov spoke informally today with a group of 
lithuanian parliamentarians and journalists about the lithuanian 
dispute he reiterated previous demands that lithuania repeal its 
independenceoriented laws journalists reported

a federal appeals court says two men who 
fled to this country may not be deported and are eligible for 
asylum because el salvadors threat to imprison men who refuse 
military service on moral grounds is religious persecution 
the 21 ruling tuesday by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
overruled the immigration and naturalization service which had 
rejected the asylum applications 
the two salvadorans are jehovahs witnesses a church whose 
members refuse to bear arms 
the ins said el salvadors refusal to exempt men with moral 
objections to war from military service was not religious 
persecution because it applied to everyone equally 
but the appeals court cited the united nations refugee agencys 
handbook which interprets international refugee treaties as 
allowing asylum claims by conscientious objectors from countries 
that do not recognize that status 
a conscientious objector is one whose actions are governed by 
conscience and persecution arises whenever that conscience is 
overcome by force or punishment meted out for the refusal to betray 
it said the opinion by judge eugene wright 
the ins could appeal the ruling to the supreme court lawyers 
for the agency did not return telephone calls to comment 
lawyers supporting the salvadorans and representatives of 
amnesty international and the united nations high commissioner for 
refugees said it was the first appellate decision in the nation to 
grant refugee status to aliens who fled their home country because 
it did not recognize conscientious objections to war 
the case before the court involved oscar canassegovia and his 
older brother jose who fled el salvador at ages 16 and 17 in 1985 
because their religions objections to military service would not 
be recognized they were arrested two days after entering the 
united states 
the brothers fled their homeland after seeing friends taken by 
soldiers from street corners and forcibly conscripted into the 
military said their lawyer karen musalo 
at their immigration hearing they also offered evidence from a 
human rights expert clergy and others in el salvador about torture 
and murder of those who refuse to join the armed forces 
ms musalo said the brothers now live in the san francisco area 
the 9th circuit ruling said the threat of imprisonment or other 
punishment for refusing military service out of genuine 
political religious or moral convictions or other genuine reasons 
of conscience was an act of religious persecution under us 
and international law 
the court also called the threat political persecution saying 
voluminous and convincing evidence showed that salvadorans who 
refused the draft were often viewed as enemies of the government 
and faced a risk of torture or death 
the court quoted an immigration judge as saying el salvador was 
one of 40 nations that refuse to grant conscientious objector 
status 
judge procter hug joined the opinion judge edward leavy agreed 
on the finding of political persecution but dissented on the 
religious issue saying an intent to persecute must be shown

center in the ural mountains today that his economic reforms will 
not be successful unless people change their attitude toward work

expanded post of executive president said the country has a 
powerful industrial base scientific potential and educated people 
but he said workers dont have enough incentives or 
responsibility 
on the one hand incentives are needed so a person has a 
different attitude to matters on the other hand incentives dont 
appear so easily for psychology is formed over decades 
gorbachev told workers on the shop floor of the gigantic uralmash 
machinebuilding complex in the city of sverdlovsk his comments

points in the city such as shortages of meat milk and fruit

tolerate tough reforms needed to save the economy 
the soviet leader well knows how difficult his conversations 
will be with workers of the urals cities with the background of 
empty store shelves tass said as the president left moscow 
gorbachev will try to gauge how the workers will take new 
social shocks in the near future the news agency said referring 
to a plan to shift the soviet union to a market economy 
no decisions on the new reform effort have been reached yet and 
some reports say the plan will be less ambitious than originally 
planned because of fears of major social unrest 
foreign reporters were not allowed to accompany gorbachev to 
sverdlovsk a closed city known as the home ground of maverick 
communist politician boris n yeltsin and a center for rock music 
which was officially frowned upon until gorbachevs glasnost 
program of greatern openness 
soviet spokesmen did not specify why gorbachev chose sverdlovsk 
for the trip the soviet leader has made a habit of staging walking 
tours in various parts of the country to get a sense of public 
opinion 
sverdlovsk residents have taken to the streets several times 
over the past months including a prenew years protest over a 
shortage of vodka 
party officials stopped the protests by flooding the stores with 
reserves of vodka but many of the citys 14 million residents 
remain unhappy about the lack of other rationed items including 
meat sugar and butter the soviet press has reported 
sverdlovsk is also one of several russian centers where 
communist party members recently ousted their local chief and

robert polhill underwent more 
questioning today about his three years as a hostage in lebanon 
clowned with his sons and hugged american kindergarteners who sent 
him a welcome home card 
us military authorities said polhill and his family would 
leave for the united states on thursday they gave no further 
details 
american officials said on tuesday that polhill shared a room 
with fellow us academics alann steen and jesse turner and was 
probably in the same building as some of the other western hostages 
held in lebanon 
a source speaking on condition he was not identified said 
today that the us debriefing team was impressed with polhills 
observant recollection of the conditions and surroundings in which 
he was held the source said officials had learned more from him 
than they had from previous hostages 
but it was not immediately clear whether polhill had provided 
information that would help us officials determine where the 
other 17 westersn hostages are being held in lebanon or what kind 
of physical condition they are in 
the boston herald reported today that steen had briefly escaped 
in 1987 but that he was was recaptured and beaten the newspaper 
quoted steens brother craig steen of orlando fla craig steen 
said polhill had conveyed the information in a telephone call on 
monday to alann steens wife virginia rose steen at her home in 
jackson mich 
mrs steen later denied the newspapers account 
us military authorities in wiesbaden said in a brief statement 
that polhill a 55yearold professor spent a second restful 
night at the us air force hospital in the german city and 
continues to eat well 
wiesbaden city manager reinhold edel visited polhill in the 
hospital and formally welcomed him to this city along the rhine 
river presenting him with a case of local german wine 
displaying the sense of humor that doctors say helped him 
survive 39 months in captivity polhill told edel he hoped there 
was a reorder blank with the wine according to us military 
authorities 
polhill freed sunday in beirut told the mayor that he steen 
and turner talked often about coming to wiesbaden and hoped it 
would be around the time of the annual autumn festivals celebrated 
in many german towns the authorities said 
polhill also posed for pictures on a hospital balcony that was 
lined with american flags and draped with a banner saying 
welcome home pray for the others 
cheered by a crowd of about 75 servicemen nurses doctors and 
fellow patients polhill waved and clasped his hands over his head 
kissed and hugged his wife feryal and bantered with sons stephen 
26 and brian 23 
im funnier than he is shouted brian wearing a camoflauge 
jacket 
polhill then pointed to himself and gave a thumbs up then to 
his sons and gave a thumbs down 
he says im not but i am brian shouted to reporters and 
photographers about 30 yards away he says youre making him feel 
really wonderful thanks 
polhill also met with 14 american kindergarteners whose parents 
are stationed at the us military base the children had made him 
a welcome home card 
each child gave polhill a yellow flower and one girl handed him 
pictures drawn by her class smiling and obviously touched he 
hugged several of them and patted two on the head 
i told him that it was nice to have him back said 
6yearold ricky houser iii from youngstown ohio he was among the 
youngsters who drew and signed the card which featured a large 
teddy bear 
i feel real sorry for him the people that dont like 
americans always kidnap them and thats what i dont like he 
said earlier 
medical director col kenneth r koskinen said tuesday that 
polhill was intellectually sharp although malnourished and 
suffering from a loss of muscle tissue 
he is essentially emptying our kitchen to say the least 
koskinen told a news conference hes eating four meals a day and 
ravenously enjoying all the food were giving him 
koskinen said the professor was very concerned about the other 
hostages and very aware that if he says something negative that 
it might have a negative impact 
his major concern that he relates to us is that im going to 
do all i can to help them be free the doctor said

premier li peng on the first visit by a chinese 
head of government to the soviet union in 26 years said today 
there will be no repeat of last springs prodemocracy 
demonstrations in china 
however li did acknowledge minor unrest in the far western 
province of xinjiang where xinjiang tv reported 22 people were 
killed in rioting april 56 it was the first such admission by the 
beijing government of the riots which the regional television 
blamed on moslems trying to start a holy war 
in a news conference li called his visit to moscow a success 
because both nations agreed to reduce military forces along their 
border and continue goodneighborly friendly relations 
yet in a clue that the two longtime communist rivals could not 
resolve all their differences li said there would be no joint 
communique such a document is customary for summit meetings 
li said no joint statement would be issued because his fourday 
visit was so short and more time and effort would be needed to 
work out a communique he said that each sides concluding 
statement would have no radical differences 
li said he saw no problems with perserving the political 
stability in china this spring a year ago studentled 
protesters clamoring for democracy overshadowed the visit to 
beijing by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the soviet visit 
ended three decades of strained relations 
some believe that in april may or june of this year more 
disturbances will affect china but i am sure that nothing of that 
sort will happen li said 
li emerged as a dominant hardline force during the turmoil in 
which the army killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of protesters 
on june 34 in beijing and since then he has tightened controls 
over chinese society 
i believe that a year ago the situation in china could not be 
compared to what we have today in china he said last year 
this time around i concentrated on handling these very delicate 
issues now i am on an official visit to the soviet union which 
means that the political situation in our country is stable 
when asked whether chinese handling of the demonstrators in 
tiananmen square could be a model for gorbachev on handling the 
separatist baltic republic of lithuania li refused to answer 
i think this question was directed to the wrong address its 
of him that you should ask such questions li said 
the chinese premier in answer to another question acknowledged 
the unrest in xinjiang he did not give a casualty toll but said 
the situation has stabilized 
a certain number of criminals there some thugs were the 
instigators of the unrest and the settlement was reached in 
accordance with the current legislation in china now the situation 
there is back to normal li said 
china agreed to provide state credits to the soviet union to pay 
for import of chinese consumer goods although li did not say what 
goods the soviet union suffers from chronic shortages of basic 
consumer goods and has been going abroad for help 
the soviet union will provide a credit to china to build a 
nuclear power station 
the military agreement provides for the mutual reduction of 
armed forces along the two countries 4350mile border

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
april 24 
the clarionledger jackson miss on hostages 
the release of robert polhill is welcome news and the united 
states should encourage terrorist groups to release the 10 
including seven americans still held captive 
but the west cannot condone any reciprocal moves as iran 
requests without condoning hostagetaking 
at worst polhills release is a cynical terrorist bet that the 
political advantage of holding hostages is waning they are trying 
to eke what they can with these human beings they view as mere 
bargaining chips 
at best they are showing an unlikely change of heart 
in any case the bush administrations stand of no deals 
appears to be working and should remain intact 
it may appear hardhearted to show no response to what is being 
touted as a humanitarian gesture by iran in calling for release 
of polhill and at least one more hostage 
but that hardheartedness pales beside the barbarism of 
kidnapping 
to show reconciliation toward polhills tormentors would only 
make the west an afterthefact accomplice to that crime 
the road polhill took to damascus and freedom was long we hope 
fervently that the road will be cleared for the remaining captives 
but we cannot reward cruelty cloaked as magnanimity

the buffalo ny news on global warming 
if there is any hope to be found in results from the white house 
conference on global warming it is that several nations appear 
ready now to reduce pollution and prevent the devastating 
consequences that eventually could result from a heightening of the 
greenhouse effect 
unfortunately the bush administration which hosted the 
conference does not want to include the united states in that 
group of forwardthinking nations 
instead in speeches that sounded like they were written by his 
chief of staff rather than his environmental chief bush lectured 
the attending ministers on the economic factors involved and 
called for more study 
in fact the president bound by a notax pledge and exhibiting 
a caretaker mentality sounded like he might just study this 
problem for the rest of his tenure he could then drop it in the 
lap of his successor much as his predecessor did with the problem 
of acid rain 
it is a disappointing response not only from someone claiming to 
be an environmentalist but from someone claiming to be a leader

the providence ri journalbulletin on lithuania 
mikhail gorbachevs admirers in the west are concerned that 
slamming the iron fist on lithuania might jeopardize the 
considerable reservoir of goodwill that exists here for the soviet 
president 
they have every right to be concerned not since the russian 
revolution has a soviet leader seemed so promising to the outside 
world and yet all that hope is now jeopardized by the 
independence crisis in lithuania 
because gorbachev is such an improvement over every one of his 
predecessors we in the west have tended to emphasize perhaps 
exaggerate his qualities as a statesman 
we should ask is he intent upon a russian counterrevolution 
as many of his partisans in the west believe or are his reforms 
mostly cosmetic in nature a change of some names and reshuffling 
of bureaucracies 
we do reserve the right to punish gorbachev for betraying 
his expressed ideals why put off the inevitable it is far 
better for all concerned to talk to the lithuanians than to 
threaten them with reprisals

the orlando fla sentinel on lithuania 
the soviet union is showing inexcusable stubbornness in dealing 
with lithuanias bid for independence soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev has now punished the baltic republic by cutting off its 
oil and natural gas supplies 
the most frustrating part of this affair is that it still could 
be resolved through negotiation 
at least president bush finally is letting gorbachev know 
that he has gone too far for weeks the white house had been 
woefully mild in its criticism of the soviets handling of the 
lithuanian crisis 
the soviet union needs to understand that there will be 
consequences if its bullying of lithuania continues

green bay wis pressgazette on earth day 
twenty years ago gaylord nelson came up with the idea of having 
a national environmental teachin the event nelson dreamed up 
became known as earth day and more than 20 million people joined 
him in observing it 
with a worldwide audience making earth day 1990 an even greater 
phenomenon than the original nelson is again in the spotlight and 
his message is similar to the one we heard from him in 1970 we can 
do better 
nelson could tout his role in earth day and the environmental 
movement he could dwell on important environmental legislation he 
pushed as a us senator from wisconsin but he has more important 
things to do 
he continues to speak out on environmental issues as a senior 
counselor for the wilderness society he has been a tough grader in 
assessing the performance of president bush and other political 
leaders on environmental matters 
nelson also continues to display the vision that became evident 
even before the first earth day the most important environmental 
legislation we could pass he says would be to require an 
environmental education starting in first grade 
if we would heed nelsons advice future generations would 
achieve his goal of making every day earth day

birmingham ala postherald on ralph david abernathy 
it was the rev ralph david abernathys fate to live most of 
his adult life in the shadow of a friend who became a legendary 
figure in the civil rights movement and us history dr martin 
luther king jr 
it was not easy to be in succession the friend of and 
collaborator with such a man as he embarked on the course that 
would change a country and bring international fame the mans 
chief aide as success and fame grew and finally with assassination 
enhancing the legend the designated successor who did not have the 
extremely rare talents found in king 
abernathy who died april 17 at age 64 paid a price for not 
being all that others in the civil rights movement thought kings 
successor should be in 1977 he was pressured to resign as 
president of the southern christian leadership conference which he 
had helped king to create in the following years he became 
increasingly alienated from and criticized by other civil rights 
leaders climaxed last fall by widespread denunciations because of 
what he wrote about kings sex life in his autobiography 
but the most important period in abernathys life and the 
period for which he should be remembered was from montgomery 
ala in the mid1950s to memphis tenn in 1968 this 
country is a better place because of what ralph david abernathy did 
during those years

the world coos bay ore on teenage parents 
somewhere somehow we have to begin breaking the cycle of 
poverty and welfare that traps the children who have children 
toward that goal we support new federal rules aimed at 
encouraging teenage parents on welfare to finish up their high 
school diploma or its equivalent 
the rules that go into effect in october are part of the welfare 
reform act they will cut the child support grants for teen parents 
by almost half if they cant prove that they are working toward a 
basic education thats not harsh thats encouraging change 
in welfare jargon the action is called a sanction losing 
part of welfare benefits for not complying with the rules of the 
system sanctions are meant to be constructive though when they 
are not applied with some common sense and understanding of 
personal situations they can be detrimental 
but we cant imagine very many situations when a high school 
diploma or ged program would not be appropriate for a teen parent 
for the most part the jobs in our society that mean financial 
security require a basic education in the case of a teen parent a 
decent job means financial security for two young people the 
teenager and the young child more importantly education and a 
job would stop the cycle of welfare dependency at a time when the 
teen parents still have the flexibility to change their future 
we have to be ready to offer more than just the requirement of 
an education well have to provide both the education and the 
other support like child care that teen parents will need to make 
those changes

the postbulletin rochester minn on children and tv watching 
no wonder there are problems in the schools if youngsters 2 to 
5 years old are watching television for 25 hours a week as 
american pediatricians report there is a good reason for problems 
the warning is based on a study by the american academy of 
pediatricians the group cited data from ac nielson co which 
shows that by the time one of todays children reaches 70 he or 
she will have spent seven years one tenth of the life span in 
front of the tv tube 
watching tv is a passive sedentary activity as the doctors 
report it can lead to obesity in children whose health would be 
much better served by sports and active play 
much of televisions programming is trivial tasteless fare the 
equivalent of yesterdays pulp magazines spending that much time 
in such an undemanding pursuit leads also to obesity of the mind 
whats to be done 
the pediatricians recommend limiting childrens viewing to one 
or two hours daily and encouraging them to spend other time in 
athletics reading and hobbies they also support legislation 
mandating broadcasting of highquality programming for license 
renewal and requiring at least one hour a day of educational 
programs for children 
the real solution lies with parents they need to recognize the 
perils of excessive tv viewing and to do something about it

the flint mich journal on clean air act exemptions 
talk about a mooot point 
analysts are just getting down to reading all the fine print in 
the massive clean air bill as one might expect lawmakers have 
tucked in all kinds of perks or exemptions for special interest 
groups some amendments are udderly amoosing take for example 
the section on cow exemptions 
cows like other creatures generate stomach gas they burp and 
make other noises because of that gas when the gas is released it 
is called methane 
but farmers dont have to worry because the us senate has 
wisely exempted cows and other farm animals from the requirements 
of the clean air act 
no we are not making this up 
congressional quarterly reports that the bill as originally 
reported out of committee required a study of various sources of 
methane including farm animals which supposedly are among the 
nations largest producers of the gas 
as the senate debated the measure cows were granted an 
exemption the move drew sarcastic comments from sen charles 
grassley riowa who said without the exemption cows would need 
catalytic converters to reduce emissions 
it is funny but it is also an example of how silly federal 
regulators can get sometimes what if the study had found that cows 
do produce huge amounts of methane what could we possibly do about 
it put them on a lowgas diet issue cowsized antacids or as 
grassley suggested maybe we could install gas collectors or 
pollution control units on the cows is there a market for cow 
methane 
this sort of silliness goes on too often in washington and it 
probably would be funnier if we werent paying so much for it

a federal judge today reduced the eight 
year sentence for former ptl official richard dortch to 2 years in 
return for testimony against others including ministry founder jim 
bakker 
dortch 58 was bakkers former top lieutenant at the bakker 
television ministry in addition to testifying at bakkers trial 
he also appeared as a government witness in the recent perjury 
trial of former ptl pastor sam johnson 
dortch was indicted in 1988 along with bakker on 24 counts of 
fraud and conspiracy for soliciting 158 million from ptl 
supporters in exchange for false guarantees of free lodging at the 
ministrys christian retreat near charlotte 
in his sevenpage order us district court judge robert potter 
said the reduction meant dortch probably would serve between 24 and 
29 months taking into account time off for good behavior the 
judge said without the reduction dortch probably would have served 
40 to 52 months 
bakker is serving a 45year prison sentence in a minnesota 
prison on his fraud and conspiracy conviction 
dortch pleaded guilty to reduced charges in return for testimony 
for the government dortch was sentenced to two consecutive 
fouryear prison terms and fined 200000 by potter 
potter did not reduce the fine 
in his order potter said dortch engaged in serious crimes 
including wire fraud mail fraud and conspiracy 
defendant dortch not only pleaded guilty and expressed 
remorse but also has been of great assistance to the government in 
its prosecutions of other defendants associated with ptl potter 
said 
defendant dortchs actions are in sharp contrast with the 
actions of his codefendant bakker who has refused to bring 
himself to understand that he has committed the violations charged 
in the indictments for which he was convicted

angola today announced that it would begin 
the first direct peace talks with the unita rebels in the next few 
days to find the path to end their 14yearold civil war 
angolas foreign minister pedro de casto van dunem loy told a 
news conference that the talks followed mediation by portugal the 
former colonial power in the african nation but he said us and 
south african supplies to the rebels could hinder progress 
there was no immediate comment from the rebels known as the 
national union for the total independence of angola or unita in 
portuguese 
in the next few days direct contacts with the union for total 
independence of angola will be beginning with the assistance of the 
portugese government which helped create conditions for the 
talks the foreign minister said 
we are convinced the talks will help us find the path to 
national reconciliation in angola he said he said the exact 
dates or location were not yet decided but would be announced soon 
van dunem said the united states and south africa were supplying 
the rebels with logistical aid weapons and ammunition south 
africa he claimed was sending the rebels military advisers and 
armed fighters 
the military assistance he said could sabotage the forthcoming 
talks and hamper the rebels willingness to sit down at the 
negotiating table and find nonmilitary means to resolve the 
conflict this military support has allowed unita to intensify its 
military actions 
the rebel group has fought the marxist government since soon 
after angola became independent of portugal in november 1975 
under a usmediated peace pact in december 1988 south africa 
was to stop aid to the rebels and cuban forces were to withdraw 
the angolan minister said the cuban troops with had fought the 
rebels for years were being withdrawn on schedule that more than 
35000 had left and that about 15000 remained 
angolas leftist government he said was instituting major 
economic and political reforms he said it was moving toward 
liberalization and privatization of the economy joining the world 
bank and international monetary fund and implementing their 
marketoriented prescriptions 
politically he said angola was adopting reforms that would 
ultimately lead to a multiparty political system and free elections

east germans rushed to their banks wednesday 
to withdraw their savings hoping to get the best possible exchange 
rate with the mighty west german mark 
while official delegations from both germanys met behind closed 
doors in east berlin to forge a plan for monetary union worried 
people stood in long lines outside their banks eager to rescue 
some of their savings 
if the west german mark doesnt come soon im going to change 
my job one bank teller who was unnerved by the pushing crowds 
told the associated press she spoke on condition of anonymity 
the highlevel negotiations now taking place are based on a bonn 
prosposal for a basic 11 exchange rate for wages and pensions 
however savings accounts would be swapped 11 only up to 4000 
marks under the current exchange rate 4000 east german marks is 
worth about 767 while 4000 west german marks is worth about 
2300 
savings above 4000 marks would be exchanged at a 21 rate 
east germans are wellknown savers having had little to spend 
their money on in a communist society beset by shortages some of 
those with more money admit to having worked out schemes to benefit 
from the exchange 
ive withdrawn all but 4000 marks and am putting the rest in 
the account of a friend said a construction worker on east 
berlins alexander square who refused to be identified that way 
we can both end up with more 
aware of the problems a government spokesman said that the east 
german government would seek to negotiate a higher ceiling for 
savings exchange rates 
i cant deny that the government wants to set the limit 
somewhat higher east german government spokesman matthias gehler 
said 
about 70 percent of all east german households have savings of 
about 5000 marks gehler added indicating that sum may be the 
governments target as a limit 
monetary union is only one of the problems facing policymakers 
from both east and west germany in their push toward unification 
with little more than two months to go before their july 2 
deadline the delegations are also trying to pave the way to an 
economic and social union of their two very disparate countries 
economic union will mean coordinating budgeting business and 
production growth goals even before the countries are fully 
unified social union covers broad areas such as unemployment 
benefits health care and education systems 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere appeared for the 
first day of what promises to be many rounds of tough negotiations 
de maiziere refused to say exactly what would be on the days 
agenda 
i dont want to say anything before negotiations even begin

medical facilities for victims of the 1984 
bhopal gas disaster are running out of money and may have to shut 
down a senior state official warned wednesday 
compounding problems faced by survivors of the union carbide gas 
leak banks here say they are not equipped to handle monthly relief 
payments ordered by prime minister vp singh 
treatment and compensation for victims of the worlds worst 
industrial disaster most of whom are poor shantytown dwellers 
have been bogged down in a tangle of bureaucracy lawsuits and 
politics for more than five years 
we will be impelled to close down the hospitals and other 
health care facilities if financial assistance does not come 
through soon said sr sathyam gas relief commissioner in 
madhya pradesh state 
he said the state government had sent an sos to the central 
government in new delhi 
the madhya pradesh government has spent 21 million in state 
funds since the dec 3 1984 gas leak sathyam said in an interview 
there is now no money to pay salaries to the hospital staff 
deliver free milk to children train the gas victims in various 
crafts and trades and extend loans to them he added 
meanwhile banks in bhopal the state capital said the central 
governments order for monthly relief payments would stretch their 
staffs too thin they suggested quarterly relief payments since 
they cannot afford to hire extra staffers to process monthly 
payments 
prime minister singh visited bhopal in january and promised gas 
victims they would get interim relief payments while his government 
fights the 470 million settlement reached by union carbide and 
former prime minister rajiv gandhi 
the singh government says far greater compensation should be 
paid by union carbide whose international headquarters are in 
danbury conn the supreme court is reviewing the settlement 
under an interim relief plan announced by singhs government 
march 5 a monthly stipend of 1165 is to be paid to each of 
500000 people living near the nowclosed union carbide pesticide 
plant 
bhopal banks say they would prefer to make quarterly payments of 
about 35 the monthly payments are supposed to start in june but 
bank sources said logistical preparations were far from complete 
the death toll from the gas leak rises almost every week as 
people who were exposed to the deadly methyl isocyanate die of 
respiratory problems and other ailments certified by health 
officials as gasrelated 
last week the federal government informed parliament the 
official toll had reached 3730 about 20000 people are officially 
listed as gasafflicted and hundreds of thousands of others have 
filed damage claims that are still being authenticated 
union carbide contended the leak was the result of sabotage by a 
disgruntled employee the indian government said it was caused by 
negligence and filed suit against the multinational and its local 
subsidiary union carbide of india ltd 
the gandhi government initially sought 3 billion in damages 
from union carbide the case dragged on through a series of 
district and state courts until the supreme court assumed complete 
jurisdiction

four months after a bloody revolution 
toppled the communist dictatorship an atmosphere of fear and 
violence remains fed by the peoples suspicion that holdouts from 
the ceausescu regime will stay in power 
the interim leadership includes many former communist officials 
and some romanians claim there is a deliberate attempt to keep 
communism alive albeit in a less stringent form 
the reluctance in purging the bureaucracy of nicolae ceausescu 
loyalists has fueled a hysterical distrust among people here who 
suffered like nobody else in the soviet bloc under the harsh 
communist ruler said stelian tanase a former dissident writer 
this week hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown 
bucharest chanting anticommunist slogans and seeking guarantees 
that no former communists could hold high positions after the may 
20 elections 
the national salvation front says it has fully broken with 
oldstyle romanian communism 
the front a loose coalition of former party members workers 
technocrats and intellectuals that took power in the 
postrevolution chaos has taken some important steps such as 
allowing demonstrations and letting romanians travel abroad 
it agreed in february to share power with opposition parties in 
the council of national unity the interim government and went on 
record as saying it supports a free market and a multiparty system 
but it also has aroused suspicions among traditionally wary 
romanians by choosing some top officials with links to ceausescu 
the front leader and the interim president ion iliescu has 
praised the humane values of communism he is the fronts 
candidate in the upcoming elections 
the interim leaders earlier this month withdrew the visa of 
exiled king michael who planned to visit the country he was forced 
to leave 43 years ago 
the front claims some 800000 members and is widely seen as the 
main contender in the elections it draws support mainly from 
industrial workers who were promised benefits if the front wins 
and from former communist party members 
the front holds a formidable advantage because everything 
that was obtained by the revolution was used as electoral 
capital for its own sake sergiu cunescu chairman of the social 
democratic party said in an interview 
he said about 90 percent of the front members are excommunists 
people live in fear he said workers in enterprises are 
asked to sign support for the front and they do sign thinking 
that if they sign they will keep their jobs 
those who dont sign are told that in case of economic 
hardships they will be the first to be fired he said 
tanase the former dissident who returned from exile in france 
after the revolution said in other east bloc countries such as 
hungary or east germany the communists lacked any means and 
resources to hide under something 
in romania they succeeded in doing this the communist party 
has managed to take cover behind the revolution under the mask of 
this national salvation front he said they wont stay in 
power too long even if they win 
iliescu has rejected allegations his movement operates like the 
old communist party 
the front declared a break with the communist structures he 
said in a speech this month a return to the past is impossible 
he said private enterprise should not exploit workers who need 
protection from inflation and unemployment through a welfare 
program 
he did not however explain how romania would attract foreign 
investment overhaul its outdated infrastructure and have enough 
cash left for unemployment benefits

african nations that dont move toward 
democracy can expect cuts in us aid the state departments top 
official on africa said wednesday 
very important members of the congress are saying we 
should direct our assistance to emerging democracies said herman 
cohen assistant secretary of state for africa democracy is not 
a condition of assistance now but i think it will be in the 
nottoodistant future 
in the past us policy has made little differentiation between 
dictatorships and democracies in giving aid cohen said some 
officials had been convinced that oneparty rule as it exists in 
many african countries could be democratic 
cohen spoke at a meeting sponsored by the bretton woods 
committee a private group that supports international aid to the 
third world 
world bank president barber conable and managing director michel 
camdessus of the international monetary fund the third worlds 
two biggest sources of aid loans also called for more democracy 
in africa 
i fear that many of africas leaders have been more concerned 
about retaining power than about the longterm development 
interests of their people conable said 
camdessus said the spread of democracy would be a help to 
economic reform 
i realize the risks of political turmoil that the process of 
democratization can entail he said but i basically believe 
that a move to a more pluralistic and accountable form of 
government can help reforms to succeed even if there are 
temporary costs

calm but we still have those who really cant accept it but 
theyre finally realizing its here

in the area nakano said loss of the store could seriously 
inconvenience residents who have not evacuated and would deal a

president bush today signed a formal 
determination that nicaragua is no longer a marxistleninist 
country restored its sugar export quota and provided 25 million 
in medical relief 
the aid will help nicaragua recover from the economic 
shambles the sandinistas left it in white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
the white house announced the aid package for the former 
sandinista government as vice president dan quayle was flying to 
todays inauguration of violeta chamorro as nicaraguas new 
president 
fitzwater said quayle was bringing the aid package with him to 
offer to mrs chamorro 
quayle was both cheered and booed when he arrived at the stadium 
in managua where mrs chamorro was to be sworn in he carried with 
him a token gift of flour and cooking oil as a symbolic gesture of 
us aid 
the formal determination that nicaragua is no longer a 
marxistleninist state will make the central american nation 
eligible for exportimport bank guarantees and credits 
the relief is a down payment on the 300 million emergency aid 
package for nicaragua still awaiting approval by congress 
despite the celebration of today president chamorro faces a 
difficult task to restore nicaraguas economy which is in shambles 
as a result of mismanagement and a flawed economic philosophy 
fitzwater said this administration will do everything it can to 
help nicaragua rebuild 
fitzwater said nicaraguas 21 percent share of us sugar 
import quotas has been restored the reagan administration had 
sharply reduced nicaraguas share in 1983 and then cut it off 
altogether in 1985 as part of its trade embargo against the 
sandinista regime 
the move allows nicaragua to export 54328 metric tons of sugar 
to the united states its share had been cut to 6000 tons in 1983 
with the rest reallocated to costa rica el salvador and honduras 
bush had earlier lifted the trade embargo 
the white house refrained from criticizing mrs chamorros 
reported decision to keep sandinista military chief gen humberto 
ortega as defense minister 
mrs chamorro is the freely elected president of that country 
and we would not comment on her internal decisions fitzwater 
said 
the sandinista general is reportedly staying on for a transition 
period 
theyre not keeping the same economic philosophy theyre 
instituting many changes and i dont think the retention of 
humberto ortega reflects on the economic course that mrs chamorro 
intends to follow the white house spokesman said 
the medical aid will go to replenish supplies at hospitals and 
public health clinics that have run short of medicine the grant 
would represent the first direct us aid to the nicaraguan 
government since 1981 
quayle left at sunrise today on a flight for managua to attend 
the inauguration of the political leader whose feb 25 election 
ended the reign of leftist sandinista president daniel ortega 
but as quayle made final preparations for the twoday trip that 
also will take him to mexico city bush on tuesday scolded the 
democraticled congress for stalling on his overall 870 million 
central american aid package 
the plan also would provide aid to panama 
i asked that they do that back in march i asked that the 
legislation be finished on april 5 and tomorrow violeta chamorro 
is being sworn in as president and we dont have that bush 
complained to a white house audience 
he appealed to a group of building contractors to please call 
your friendly senator and tell him to get going and get this 
legislation passed id like to have that legislation intact so 
that our able vice president can report that to mrs chamorro when 
he goes down there tomorrow 
bushs package is stalled in congress over unrelated 
legislation on tuesday the senate appropriations committee voted 
1514 to provide 300 million to nicaragua and 420 million to 
panama 
failure to approve the full aid package by mrs chamorros 
inauguration should not be seen as an embarrassment house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash said tuesday 
it is a matter of procedures here he told reporters we 
have procedures that obviously have to go forward and i think 
eventually that aid package will be voted 
the administrations aid request for nicaragua is designed to 
help that country among the poorest in the hemisphere to recover 
from a decade of civil war and us trade sanctions it includes 
money to meet immediate needs for planting of crops and for fuel 
the white house earlier made 36 million available to a united 
nations group that is seeking to help demobilize and repatriate 
contra rebels whose guerrilla battles against the sandinista 
government at one time were actively supported by administration of 
former president reagan 
officials of the new government have conceded they face a 
difficult challenge in meeting the electorates expectations for a 
better standard of living

a form of a natural body chemical appears to 
significantly reduce the complications of kidney transplants 
cutting in half the risk that the new organ will be rejected 
according to a study 
doctors found that misoprostol a synthetic version of the 
substance prostaglandin reduced the risk of organ rejection from 
51 percent to 26 percent 
in the comparison study doctors tested misoprostol in 
combination with cyclosporine a medicine that has been widely used 
since the early 1980s to prevent organ rejection 
prostaglandins are made by tissue throughout the body and serve 
a variety of purposes cyclosporine interferes with the ability of 
the kidneys to make the substance 
the study was directed by dr mark moran of gd searle and co 
the pharmaceutical firm that makes misoprostol the medicine is 
currently approved to prevent gastric ulcers that can occur when 
people are treated for inflammation 
the research published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine compared 39 transplant patients who took cyclosporine and 
other standard medicines with 38 patients who also received 
misoprostol 
when rejection occurs patients must receive extra doses of 
medicines that suppress their bodys diseasefighting immune 
systems while this frequently allows them to keep their new 
organs it leaves them susceptible to infections 
it seems likely that prostaglandin will have several uses 
because of its ability to reduce rejection and improve kidney 
function in patients with all sorts of transplants said moran 
this also suggests that we may be able to reduce doses of other 
more toxic immunosuppressants 
an editorial by dr charles b carpenter of brigham and womens 
hospital in boston said the work appears to confirm animal studies 
he said it should promote more intensive investigation of 
prostaglandin therapy 
in a separate report in the journal dr jeanpaul soulillou and 
others from the national institute of health and medical research 
in nantes france tested a different approach to blocking 
rejection 
they gave patients antibodies that attacked one variety of 
freshly activated white blood cells known as t leukocytes they 
said it worked as well as another treatment using antibodies that 
were not specifically targeted against these cells but it produced 
fewer unwanted side effects

the rev hosea williams said he missed the 
funeral of his estranged civil rights colleague the rev ralph 
david abernathy because he was injured in an altercation while 
trying to visit the ailing abernathy 
williams and abernathys son state rep ralph david abernathy 
iii both acknowledged that an incident occurred the week before 
abernathy died april 17 but gave differing accounts williams 
entered a hospital a few days after the incident and remained 
hospitalized this morning abernathys funeral was monday 
williams was admitted to emory university hospital on april 15 
for treatment of an arm condition hospital spokeswoman eve 
patterson said this morning he could be released as early as 
today she said 
williams said tuesday that he tried to visit abernathy in 
crawford long hospital on april 11 but abernathys son told him 
that doctors were allowing only family members to visit 
williams a longtime civil rights activist and former atlanta 
city council member had called abernathy the judas of the 
movement after abernathys 1989 autobiography described alleged 
sexual indiscretions committed by martin luther king jr the night 
before his assassination 
williams said he saw the elder abernathy sitting in a chair 
inside the hospital room and tried to enter when the younger 
abernathy grabbed me around my waist and shoved me outside i 
didnt try to hit the boy i thought about it but i didnt do it 
the younger abernathy described the incident as a fight 
abernathy said williams busted on through the door and got 
halfway in despite doctors orders and the familys wishes 
against visitors 
he threw up a forearm to try to push me out of the way he 
hit me across the chest and the shoulder the younger abernathy 
said tuesday so i grabbed him and pushed him back out of the 
door and against the wall 
i think what happened at the hospital was just uncle hoseas 
guilty conscience eating away at him the younger abernathy said 
abernathy said his father wasnt aware of williams presence 
until the incident was over and when told of it said no i do 
not want to see hosea 
asked to comment on abernathys version williams said i did 
not try to barge into the room it was not a physical thing look 
i could have popped little ralphs neck off like a chicken if id 
wanted to but you just print little ralphs version the abernathy 
family has suffered enough

about 15000 nicaraguans today 
gathered in a sports stadium to witness the transfer of power from 
the leftist sandinistas to usbacked presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
some sandinista supporters chanted assassin when the black 
limosine carrying vice president dan quayle entered the stadium 
before the inauguration and one person threw a rock toward the 
vehicle other nicaraguans cheered him 
on the eve of the ceremony mrs chamorro infuriated leaders of 
her political coalition by reportedly deciding to retain the 
sandinistas longtime military chief 
gen humberto ortega a leader of the sandinista revolution is 
to stay on for a time to promote reconciliation between the 
prous administration and the leftists who ruled nicaragua for a 
decade an administration source said 
nicaragua is emerging from nine years of civil war that claimed 
30000 lives and left the economy in tatters and mrs chamorro 
60 has promised its 35 million people peace 
but by keeping outgoing president daniel ortegas brother at the 
helm of the military mrs chamorro would probably make it more 
difficult to persuade the ussupported contra rebels to disarm 
the upperclass newspaper publisher also runs the risk of 
alienating the leaders of the ideologically diverse coalition she 
led to victory in feb 25 elections 
it is unacceptable that members representative of the fsln 
sandinista front remain in highlevel posts in the army interior 
ministry and other government structures the coalition 
leadership said in a statement tuesday 
the sandinistas often treated their political opponents harshly 
so it is no surprise that members of the new government wish to see 
them completely out of government 
the leadership of the 14party united national opposition 
coalition or uno has frequently been at odds with the small 
circle of chamorro advisers that is putting her government together 
a source close to mrs chamorro told the associated press that 
leaving gen ortega in place would be a temporary measure and 
confirmed a report in the chamorro family newspaper la prensa that 
the presidentelect will at the outset assume the post of defense 
minister 
there are some extremists within uno that want the 
sandinistas wiped out in one fell swoop the source said that 
cannot be he gen ortega will be eased out but not for a 
while 
the contras and members of the chamorro coalition have demanded 
that the army be purged of sandinista loyalists 
president daniel ortega said the united states is exerting 
very strong pressure on mrs chamorro to avoid fulfilling a 
transfer of power protocol and warned that this would be chaos 
for nicaragua barricada the official newspaper of the 
sandinista front said in todays editions 
gen ortega was a member of the sandinistas nineman 
directorate until he quit monday to honor an agreement to 
depoliticize the armed forces 
all officers in the army and security forces likewise resigned 
from leadership positions in the sandinista front presumably 
making them eligible to stay on after mrs chamorro takes over 
the resignations are unlikely however to placate many of the 
thousands of armed contras in the countryside who say they will not 
disarm as agreed by june 10 unless the army is purged of 
sandinistas 
the rebels were to begin turning in their weapons today at 
specially designated security zones supervised by un 
peacekeepers 
discord in the new governing coalition was also evident tuesday 
when the new national assembly was inaugurated 
in an internal primary over the weekend myriam arguello of the 
peoples conservative alliance won 28 votes from unos 51 deputies 
to win the coalitions nomination for national assembly president 
alfredo cesar of the social democrats and a protege of mrs 
chamorro received 23 votes 
but at tuesdays first session of the new assembly ms arguello 
and her supporters did not return from a recess for a secret vote 
on the the legislative president after cesar appeared to have won 
sandinista support for his candidacy 
cesar was rumored to have agreed to support gen ortegas 
staying on as army chief in exchange for the votes of the 
assemblys 39 sandinista deputies 
in washington president bush today signed a formal 
determination that nicaragua is no longer a marxistleninist 
country restored its sugar export quota and provided 25 million 
in medical relief the relief is a down payment on the 300 million 
emergency aid package still awaiting approval by congress 
even the 300 million would be only just about enough to get 
nicaragua through this year the money already is too late to boost 
the planting season that begins in a weeks time and agriculture 
is the backbone of nicaragua 
as one of her first official acts as president mrs chamorro 
was expected to place flowers on the grave of her husband pedro 
joaquin chamorro whose assassination helped spark the 1979 
revolution that brought the sandinistas to power

a reputed mentor of proiranian 
kidnappers urged them to continue holding their western hostages 
wednesday and accused the united states of sabotaging efforts to 
win the release of other captives 
shiite moslem leader hussein musawi said a nonbinding us 
house of representatives resolution tuesday endorsing a united 
jerusalem as israels capital complicated efforts to free another 
hostage 
the moslems in lebanon offered a rose only to get a stone 
thrown at them musawi told a group of journalists from western 
news organizations including the associated press 
sundays release of american robert polhill after 39 months in 
captivity raised hopes another western hostage could be freed 
kidnappers are believed to be holding 17 western hostages 
including seven americans 
polhill who was flown to wiesbaden west germany after his 
release plans to return to the united states with his family on 
thursday us military officials said 
musawi is believed to have played a key role in polhills 
release the bearded softspoken former teacher alluded to his 
repeated urgings to the kidnappers to show good will by releasing a 
hostage 
so they did and released polhill musawi said but upon 
that release we heard the news of the house of representatives 
resolution on jerusalem if every release is matched by such a 
monumentally illintentioned american response why then should any 
hostage be freed 
we hope that no other hostage will be released said musawi 
reputed mentor of the proiranian group that held polhill the 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
polhill 55 a lecturer on accounting was kidnapped from the 
campus of the usaffiliated beirut university college with two 
other american educators jan 24 1987 the other two jesse 
turner 42 of boise idaho and alann steen 51 of boston are 
still held by islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
we expect the hostageholders to complicate matters and we 
hope they will not liberate any of the hostages the house of 
representatives motion was a maximum illintention musawi said 
he stressed the word maximum in english and otherwise spoke 
in arabic musawi heads the islamic amal faction within hezbollah 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for groups holding 
hostages 
asked about persistent reports a second american hostage would 
be freed during eid alfitr the threeday feast that begins 
thursday and marks the end of the moslem holy month of ramadan 
musawi said 
there is plenty of talk about such a move i do not think eid 
alfitr means anything to the americans and i dont think theres 
an atmosphere for such an early release 
musawi said the release of lebanese and palestinian prisoners 
held by israel and its militia ally the south lebanon army was 
essential toward freeing the remaining westerners in lebanon 
the release of the prisoners held by israel and its surrogates 
is a foremost issue and should be simultaneous with the release of 
the hostages he said 
officials in jerusalem had said israel and the israeliallied 
south lebanon army planned prisoner releases this week to mark the 
end of ramadan 
but south lebanon army leader antoine lahd on wednesday canceled 
plans to release some of the 300 mostly shiite prisoners he holds 
sources said in the past two years he had released prisoners on 
the holiday 
releasing them now would be seen as an american payment to the 
hezbollah through israeli agents he was quoted as telling israel 
radio 
most of the seven americans four britons two west germans two 
swiss one italian and one irishman are believed held by 
proiranian shiite factions the longestheld hostage is american 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
asked whether the hostages were all alive musawi said there was 
no proof anyone was dead he also said he believed the various 
factions holding captives knew one another 
in tehran irans radical parliament speaker mehdi karrubi 
said us officials were more spiteful of the islamic republic now 
than when washington launched its failed military operation in 
april 1980 to free us hostages in tehran 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said karrubi was speaking on 
the anniversary of the us mission to free 52 americans held 
hostage at the us embassy in the iranian capital 
the rescue mission was aborted after two us aircraft collided 
at a desert base south of tehran and eight crewmen were killed 
karrubi appeared to be preempting any possible thawing of 
relations between tehran and washington following polhills 
release iranian president hashemi rafsanjani has urged that the 
hostages be released and is believed to favor better relations with 
the west

pearls place a restaurant that 
police say served more drugs than food and was the scene of 12 
killings during the past six years has been ordered closed 
there are a lot of legitimate restaurants but this just 
wasnt one of them detective john tucker said tuesday 
circuit judge virginia q beverly declared the restaurant a 
public nuisance and ordered the restaurant closed by 5 pm friday 
she also ruled that anyone wanting to operate a business from that 
building must get special permission from the city 
seven of the killings on the restaurants corner have been 
drugrelated and two occurred inside the building tucker said 
during the past three years police also have investigated eight 
car thefts 29 assaults 26 other crimes and made 109 drug arrests 
in the area records show 
the city sued last summer to close pearls place but the 
process took until last week to resolve because owner pearl 
williams initially requested a jury trial on the closing 
attorney joe farley who represents mrs williams said they 
dropped the request and consented to a hearing before beverly 
mrs williams was charged last year with six counts of selling 
crack and three counts of conspiracy to sell crack she has not 
been tried on those charges 
farley doubted the closing would have any impact on lowering 
crime in the area 
im sure theres not going to be a registered difference once 
they close her place down he said

the bush administration and several democrats 
lined up wednesday against a popular bill to have schoolchildren 
help finance the war on drugs by buying world war iistyle savings 
stamps and bonds 
the bill sponsored chiefly by rep jerry lewis rcalif 
carries the signatures of 249 of the 435 members of the house it 
would allow the treasury department to issue up to 4 billion worth 
of bonds for education prisons and other antidrug programs 
as in world war ii i am convinced that the war on drugs will 
not be won until we mobilize the american public lewis told the 
house ways and means committee 
he recalled how as a child he bought 25cent savings stamp then 
traded in each 1875 book of stamps for a war bond 
the treasury department objects to the bill because it does not 
like special borrowing programs and department official michael e 
basham said the drug war bond act would be expensive to 
administer 
several democrats were more pointed in their criticism 
its a question of whether we should be borrowing from our 
children to teach them the dangers of drugs when many of the most 
vulnerable are also among the nations poorest said rep charles 
rangel dny who heads the house committee on narcotics 
theres another addiction occurring in this country an 
addiction to debt said rep byron dorgan dnd 
lewis agreed with rangel that because of federal budgeting 
practices the bill does not guarantee that even an additional 
penny would be available for fighting drugs 
the intent lewis said is to draw the public into the war and 
to make a commitment to finance the fight 
a galaxy of entertainment stars has lined up behind lewiss bill 
actor dennis franz who was a detective on hill street blues 
and plays an antidrug undercover cop on the nasty boys series 
promised that entertainers would play a big role in promoting the 
sale of drug bonds 
we will be spreading a message to everyone watching 
especially our youth that drugs are not acceptable that drugs are 
not cool and that drugs are not safe franz said 
even on that point there was disagreement 
there is a perception that entertainment and sports 
celebrities use drugs on a regular basis and encounter few if any 
negative consequences those messages are most damaging when 
delivered by those who are alleged to be recovering from 
addiction said robert j hill of vienna va a former police 
officer and recovering alcoholic who heads the coalition for a 
drugfree community 
dick herndobler of ashland ore who directs the elks national 
drug awareness program said the proposed bonds would be a welcome 
addition 
alice c donahue international president of the general 
federation of womens clubs agreed 
by giving individuals an opportunity to do something even 
something so simple as buying a bond we will help to build a 
consensus that drug abuse is a problem in which we can and 
should become involved in finding a solution she said 
ron sarasin president of the national beer wholesalers 
association said his organization will buy the first 100000 of 
drug bonds

the united states and japan reached agreement 
today on removing various barriers to the sale of american forest 
products in japan us officials announced 
the conclusion of the negotiations on forest products clears up 
the final case cited by the bush administration a year ago when it 
placed japan on a trade hit list of the countries with the most 
offensive barriers to sales of american products 
in recent weeks officials had announced agreement on increasing 
sales of american supercomputers and satellites in the japanese 
market the two other products cited 
us trade representative carla hills said that us and 
japanese negotiators had resolved the wood products dispute after 
lengthy discussions in tokyo 
we believe this agreement will provide major benefits to us 
exporters she said in a statement not only will it result in 
millions of dollars of us exports but it will offer lower cost 
and high quality wood housing to japanese consumers 
she said the agreement could increase the sale of us wood 
products in japan by as much as 1 billion annually by lowering 
tariffs and revising japanese building code standards 
the announcement of the successful completion of talks on wood 
products came as the bush administration is facing an april 30 
deadline for deciding whether to target japan for a second year in 
a row as an unfair trader under a tough section of the 1988 trade 
law known as super 301 
hills said the administration has not made a final decision on 
the issue but she gave strong indications in testimony before the 
senate finance committee today that japan will not be targeted 
because of the progress it has made in recent weeks in settling 
trade disputes with the united states 
several senators including finance committee chairman lloyd 
bentsen dtexas said it would be a mistake for the administration 
to fail to target tokyo again given americas huge 49 billion 
trade deficit with japan 
but hills insisted that the super 301 targeting mechanism was 
only one of the tools available to force markets open in japan and 
that using it again could jeopardize the progress that has been 
made 
our objectives are all the same to open the market for 
american businesses she said i must be allowed some 
discretion to say which tools should be used

a new form of a common high blood pressure 
medicine appears to slow the lifethreatening lung damage of cystic 
fibrosis and could dramatically improve the lives of people with 
the frequent inherited disorder 
the conclusions were from a preliminary study of the medicine 
amiloride 
the medicine when inhaled in a spray form seemed to help clear 
thick secretions that clog cystic fibrosis patients lungs it 
reduced the loss of lung capacity by 60 percent when compared to a 
dummy treatment 
cystic fibrosis strikes about one in 2500 babies born in the 
united states only about half of the victims live to their 
mid20s and almost all of the deaths are from lung disease 
because of an inherited abnormality in people with cystic 
fibrosis the cells that line the air tubes in their lungs absorb 
too much salt and water this produces a thick mucous that blocks 
the lungs and makes victims prone to infections and breathing 
problems 
amiloride a diuretic appears to work by reducing the lung 
cells absorption of salt and water 
in the initial study doctors tried the treatment on adults 
whose lungs were already seriously damaged by years of infection 
no one has tried it yet on youngsters whose lungs are still 
relatively healthy but researchers hope it will significantly 
change the course of their illness 
our fantasy is that it could be much more useful if given 
early in life over the long haul said dr michael r knowles a 
developer of the treatment at the university of north carolina 
he cautioned however that the diuretic which is ordinarily 
used to prevent water retention could be harmful to childrens 
kidneys or have other unwanted side effects 
dr robert beall research director of the cystic fibrosis 
foundation said that a study is planned that will test the 
medicine on youngsters under age 12 
it could increase life exponentially beall said we feel 
that if we can change the environment of the lung so that we dont 
give bacteria a good place to live we might add decades to these 
kids lives 
a report on knowles initial study conducted on 14 adults was 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
for two consecutive sixmonth periods they used aerosol 
amiloride or a placebo while their conditions did not improve the 
rate of lung damage appeared to be slowed while taking amiloride 
cystic fibrosis is now treated primarily by giving antibiotics 
and pounding on victims chests to loosen the mucous in their 
lungs the new approach exploits several years of research into the 
underlying abnormality in cystic fibrosis 
what is particularly exciting is that we for the first time 
have used a therapy that tries to treat the primary defect which 
is the abnormal movement of ions across the membranes said 
beall we are going to the source of the problem 
amiloride has been available in the united states in pill form 
for five years to treat high blood pressure congestive heart 
failure and fluid retention associated with kidney disease 
however the pills are ineffective against cystic fibrosis 
knowles and two other researchers hold the patent on the aerosol 
technique the pharmaceutical firm glaxo has bought the rights to 
produce the inhaled form of the drug 
more testing will be necessary before permission is sought from 
the us food and drug administration to make the treatment 
routinely available until then cystic fibrosis patients will be 
able to obtain the therapy only by enrolling in experimental trials 
of the medication

the last five prisoners abandoned the 
roof of strangeways prison today to end a standoff that began with 
a devastating riot and became the longest prison siege in british 
history 
the prisoners climbed into a crane placed alongside the roof of 
the cell block raising clenched fists and holding each others 
hands aloft as they were brought to the ground they were then 
taken into custody by police in riot gear 
the prisoners timed their end of the 25day siege so that it 
appeared live on the main british broadcasting corp television 
evening newscast 
earlier today squads of prison officers swept into the prison 
to try to recapture the prisoners 
officials said more than 100 prison officers regained control of 
all the prison buildings by midmorning isolating the last inmates 
on the roof of the grim victorian jail no injuries were reported 
in the operation 
officers huddled just under the roof poking their heads through 
holes made when prisoners ripped out the slate shingles to throw at 
authorities during the beginning of the siege 
during the siege inmates built and rebuilt barricades and 
planted booby traps to keep out authorities 
the prisoners had ignored a midday deadline paul taylor 29 
the apparent ringleader stood on top of a chimney stack dancing 
and performing a mock striptease 
weeks of patient negotiations brought out all but the last five 
of the 1650 inmates 
the siege began with a riot april 1 in the prison chapel that 
spread throughout the jail about 300 prisoners overwhelmed guards 
during the sunday service took the jail keys and released the rest 
of the inmates 
running battles raged in the prison in northern england for 
about four days and prompted unrest and violence in jails 
throughout the country 
prison officials had hoped negotiations would coax all inmates 
to surrender 
through handpainted signs makeshift megaphones and talks with 
officials the prisoners complained of poor food alleged brutality 
by prison officials and overcrowding in the prison originally 
built to hold 950 inmates 
inmates were held three or four to a tiny cells before the riot 
allowed a shower and change of clothes once a week and provided 
with a bucket instead of a toilet 
one prison officer died in hospital during the riot as a result 
of an existing heart condition

a smiling gunman who killed one person and 
wounded four at a suburban shopping mall had been released 36 hours 
earlier from a mental hospital where he had been listed as having 
homicidal tendencies police say 
the man wearing a business suit fired into a lunch hour crowd 
tuesday before he calmly tossed the 38caliber revolver into a 
trash can and surrendered apparently at the urging of an elderly 
man authorities said 
you dont know what all these people have done to me james 
calvin brady 31 was said by authorities to have muttered as he 
was led away 
he was charged with murder and four counts of aggravated assault 
and jailed without bail two of the wounded were listed in critical 
condition 
during questioning brady talked of god and a mechanical 
device inside him that controls his actions police said hes 
suffering from hallucinations he was probably having one when he 
fired said col mf ferguson 
a document found in bradys pocket said he was released monday 
from georgia regional hospital in atlanta he was admitted to the 
state hospital april 13 but the document did not say why he was 
released ferguson said 
gov joe frank harris said today that the reason for bradys 
release was under investigation but it was not due to overcrowding 
at the mental hospital 
the state is sincere in trying to do everything that we 
can to prevent something like this from happening harris added 
in this case i think it was being done 
the document said he had homicidal and suicidal tendencies 
and suffered from delusions ferguson said brady can be 
hostile threatening and has a history of alcohol abuse the 
colonel quoted it as saying 
marchant roach spokesman for the state department of human 
resources which runs the state hospitals said the department 
would not comment on any patient 
officers said brady bought the snubnosed revolver and 12 rounds 
of hollowpoint ammunition a type designed to expand on impact and 
cause especially severe wounds for 129 at a pawn shop in atlanta 
on monday 
how did he get the gun why did he get the gun detective 
lt rodney maddox said we dont have a good answer to that and 
may never know why 
georgia law does not restrict the sale of handguns or rifles but 
requires a license for anyone who carries a concealable weapon 
such a license cannot be obtained within five years of release from 
a psychiatric hospital 
once inside the malls food court brady appeared to fire at 
random police and witnesses said 
he looked like a businessman with his left hand in his pants 
pocket said carol gravdahl a store manager at perimeter mall a 
few miles north of the city his right arm was straight out with 
a pistol shooting it off randomly he was coming around with it 
until i guess he emptied it and he was smiling 
after firing six shots bradhy attempted to reload but an 
elderly man apparently talked him out of it police said 
there may be a hero in this thing ferguson said we still 
dont know who he is but wed sure like to talk to him wed like 
to know what he said to him 
michael gregory musick 24 of suburban norcross was shot in 
the chest and died at northside hospital police said 
craig e bruno 23 of roswell was shot in the abdomen and was 
listed in stable condition today lucille hughey 74 of decatur 
was wounded in the side and was listed in critical but stable 
condition after surgery judy shell 53 of roswell was shot in 
the legs and listed in stable condition 
james mcdonald 30 of alpharetta was treated at a hospital for 
a gunshot wound to the ankle and was released 
rambling disjointed notes found in an atlanta apartment from 
which brady was evicted tuesday morning said he had taken crack and 
then met two people in california who created a machine that would 
control his mind 
if i got the public at large outcry and attention of why i 
became insane the public would bring these two people to 
accounting the notes said

the sheer size of dinosaurs may have helped them 
live in a variety of climates without getting too hot or cold a 
study of huge turtles suggests 
researchers found evidence that large coldblooded animals can 
keep constant high body temperatures by large body size low 
metabolic rate and the use of some peripheral tissues as insulation 
the study focused on leatherback turtles which are among the 
largest living reptiles they can weigh more than 1500 pounds 
the turtles range from the tropics to near the arctic circle 
they can warm up on land and keep elevated body temperatures in 
cold seawater researchers said 
scientists measured metabolic rates of six adult females and 
mathematically analyzed the turtles ability to maintain a 
relatively high internal temperature 
leatherbacks may restrict the flow of blood to the skin to keep 
warm and increase it to avoid overheating researchers said 
support for that idea comes in the observation that the turtles 
soft skin appears to be flushed with blood while the animal nests 
the researchers said 
the scientists suggested that their proposed 
temperatureregulating system for large animals be called 
gigantothermy 
such a system may have allowed dinosaurs to live in a wide 
variety of habitats including polar regions the researchers said 
the work is reported in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by scientists from drexel university in philadelphia and 
purdue university in fort wayne ind

shoppers are welcome to browse at the 
downtown parkfair mall but teenage buyers beware because of 
rowdy behavior the mall has banned unescorted youths on weekday 
afternoons 
the threetiered mall has been the site of recent afterschool 
brawls 
teenagers assaulted two police officers trying to break up two 
fights march 30 more than 100 youths were dispersed and four 
teenagers were arrested 
i was here that day and i was scared a woman who refused to 
give her name said last week it was getting rather treacherous 
with the kids 
the often bustling mall was relatively quiet that day tables at 
the ground floor fastfood restaurants were largely empty 
our business is down said one fastfood clerk naeem 
muhammad but the theory is when we get this cleaned up other 
people will come down 
some patrons and shop clerks questioned whether banning an 
entire group of people from the mall between 230 pm and 430 
pm was the answer 
they can come in here and act like ladies and gentlemen 
said rose shaffer 52 who goes to the mall three or four times a 
week they shouldnt punish them all 
one 16yearold turned away from the mall when he didnt produce 
any identification said the policy was aimed at blacks 
they aint sweatin it for whites said ed young this 
whole dilemma is strictly racial 
police are frustrated by lack of cooperation when trouble occurs 
we have kids coming out yelling racism and police 
brutality and that stuff sgt garry gernandt said while on foot 
patrol around the mall 
i think basically the problem is you got 10 percent of the 
kids causing problems for everybody 
the policy was implemented april 16 and backed up by police foot 
patrols scheduled for the assignment through this week private 
security patrolled inside the mall 
metro center realvest which owns the mall said the policy will 
remain in effect as long as it works 
its indefinite at this point metro center vice president 
michael wiese said 
the march 30 incident was the most recent and most dramatic 
wiese said but the problem of youths congregating and causing 
problems inside the mall has been ongoing for some time 
we have decided at this point that this is the most 
appropriate way to restore order to the mall wiese said we 
have looked at what we feel are a number of legally permissible 
options and this is the one we decided to implement 
there are no apparent legal problems with the parkfair curfew 
said dick shugrue a law professor at creighton university in omaha 
age classifications need only be reasonable in a legal 
setting in a private setting by and large there isnt any 
constitutional argument you could make shugrue said 
the question boils down to whether its a good business 
decision

president bush bitterly criticized by 
lithuania said wednesday i dont need any defense for refusing 
to penalize the soviet union for its economic squeeze on the 
breakaway baltic republic 
the policies decisions ive taken have had strong support 
from the american people and thats who i work for said bush 
the president did not reply when asked by a reporter how 
lithuanians view his decision 
while bush has won support from some congressional leaders for 
his strategy there also were signs of restiveness wednesday about 
the lack of a us response 
senate democratic leader george mitchell said bush should take 
some action to express disapproval and to deter further actions 
against lithuania 
he suggested slowdowns in ussoviet talks on the environment 
taxes investment or trade but also said bush was in the best 
position to decide 
for a second straight day lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis denounced bushs refusal to curb economic ties with the 
soviets in reaction to coercion of lithuania 
our people remember how they were abandoned after world war ii 
relegated to the stalinist empire it just saddens us to see 
western nations especially the united states being misled by the 
soviet union landsbergis said in a telephone call with members 
of congress 
the soviets are strangling our nation like a boa 
constrictor he said referring to the mounting pressure from 
moscow to force lithuania to drop its drive to secede from the 
soviet union 
a day earlier landsbergis had charged this is another 
munich when bush delayed any economic sanctions 
landsbergis was invoking the infamous memory of french and 
british appeasement of nazi germany that culminated in the 1938 
munich pact sacrificing much of czechoslovakia to germany 
the white house said it took no offense at landsbergis remark 
no we understand his frustrations and his efforts on behalf 
of his people white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
mr landsbergis is fully aware of the presidents concern and 
interest in freedom in his country fitzwater said 
during a picturetaking ceremony at the white house a reporter 
questioned bush about landsbergis munich comment asking how 
he defended himself i dont need any defense bush said 
adding that he enjoyed widespread support for his policies 
on capitol hill secretary of state james a baker iii told a 
senate appropriations subcommittee that the soviet union must allow 
lithuanians to decide their own future 
but baker said the administration still was not prepared to levy 
economic sanctions against moscow to force negotiations with 
lithuanian leaders 
we are involved in quiet diplomacy in an effort to promote 
such a dialogue the only real answer to an effective resolution 
of this conflict baker said 
the soviets are going to have to allow the lithuanians to 
fully exercise their rights of selfdetermination baker said 
fitzwater said the president has reiterated time and again 
our support for freedom of lithuania and other countries of the 
world indeed preserving the fragile environment for freedom and 
selfdetermination guides our policy 
the united states has never recognized the soviet unions 
forcible annexation in 1940 of lithuania latvia and estonia but 
bush has counseled restraint and dialogue since the lithuanian 
parliament declared its independence march 11 
bush has repeatedly cautioned the kremlin against using force to 
bring lithuania into line but he has also said the baltic state 
must recognize certain realities of its ties to the soviet 
union 
as baker testified landsbergis told some members of congress 
it appears that the west doesnt want to help lithuania our 
reaction is one of discouragement and disappointment it feels as 
if our worst fears are being realized 
late tuesday the senate appropriations committee inserted in a 
supplemental spending bill a provision setting aside 10 million to 
build and staff a us embassy in lithuania should the united 
states formally recognize the baltic republics independence 
in criticism less restrained than mitchells sen barbara 
mikulski dmd issued a statement voicing mounting outrage and 
frustration at the lack of a us response to moscows moves she 
said the soviets have got to get a message from the free world 
you cannot keep your empire by the force of your guns

the leader of a white 
supremacist group warned that his supporters will retaliate unless 
nelson mandelas african national congress calls off its guerrilla 
campaign a newspaper said wednesday 
eugene terreblanche head of the neonazi afrikaner resistance 
movement also told the citizen newspaper that white south africans 
would never accept a black government he said president fw de 
klerks government was headed for collapse and massive unrest 
we will not allow our people to be murdered it looks to me as 
though the government is on the road to capitulation we are not 
prepared to live under an anc government which will mean chaos 
terreblanche was quoted as saying 
in other developments 
two senior anc leaders general secretary alfred nzo and 
national executive commmittee member joe slovo were scheduled to 
return friday to south africa after decades in exile the anc said 
nzo and slovo will be part of an 11member anc delegation to hold 
talks may 24 with the de klerk government 
police said two police officers and four protesters were 
injured in clashes in various parts of the country when officers 
used shotguns tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse 
demonstrators police who gave few details said 48 protesters 
were arrested in various incidents 
the new military rulers in the nominally independent ciskei 
homeland said they would grant amnesty to some prisoners in the 
tribal reserve no details were available the military rulers 
sympathetic to the anc and other antiapartheid groups came to 
power last month in a coup that ousted a conservative 
authoritarian leader 
de klerk has expressed concern about rightwing white groups 
that are arming themselves to oppose sharing power with the 
nations black majority 
the talks in may are designed to clear the way for formal 
negotiations on changing the constitution to give blacks a voice in 
national affairs 
terreblanche and other extremist leaders are forming a 
commando movement of armed followers to resist the end of 
whiteminority rule his movement is thought to number a few 
thousand 
the anc the leading black political organization has refused 
to formally halt its armed struggle even though the guerrilla 
campaign has been largely dormant for the past year 
my message to anc is that if it persists with its armed 
struggle we will meet it head on terreblanche said in the 
interview with the citizen which is progovernment

pioneering tenor saxophonist and known to filmgoers for his 
oscarnominated performance in the 1986 movie round midnight 
died today he was 67 
gordon died at 1250 am of kidney failure said don lucoff 
spokesman for blue note records in new york he said gordon had 
been in poor health and was admitted to thomas jefferson university 
hospital in philadelphia on march 18 for treatment of cancer of the 
larynx 
nevertheless gordon recently had finished filming 
awakenings a movie with robert deniro and robin williams 
its very very difficult to even contemplate that weve lost 
such a great master of his instrument and icredible human being 
said guitarist george benson he was quite a man 
in the 1940s gordon helped define the bebop style of jazz begun 
by lester young charlie parker and john coltrane and his playing

a new radar system that will allow military 
observers to look over the earths horizon and get an earlier 
warning of enemy aircraft or drugsmuggling planes has been turned 
over to the air force 
by being able to detect enemy aircraft farther away the air 
force gets as long as 3 hours to respond to a threat of an attack 
compared with perhaps only a few minutes with conventional radar 
systems officials said 
the 680 million backscatter system turned over to the military 
tuesday gives the air force eyes over a semicircular 45 
millionsquaremile swath across the atlantic from greenland to 
cuba the air force said 
the operations center is based in the outskirts of this central 
maine city and the antennas are in moscow moscow maine that is 
the maine system is the first of four that will eventually form 
an early warning shield around most of north americas perimeter 
its range of up to 1800 miles is nearly 10 times greater than than 
of conventional radar 
while the overthehorizon system was designed primarily to give 
the air force more time to spot enemy bombers it will also be 
useful in detecting small planes carrying illegal narcotics said 
col john o lenz the systems program director 
enemy cruise missiles however would be a very difficult 
target perhaps the most difficult target for this type of 
radar lenz said after the air force took possession of the 
bangor operations center from general electric co 
the air force plans to hire private contractors to run the 
operations center by mid1992 although the most sensitive 
decisionmaking roles such as whether to call for a military 
response to an errant plane will remain in military hands us 
and canadian air force personnel are currently staffing the center 
a bank of 16 computer systems collects the required flight plans 
from all planes that enter the backscatter systems range telling 
technicians whether aircraft represented by blips on their computer 
screens belong in that airspace 
if they dont have a flight plan it enables the operator to 
say id better take another look at this said capt alan m 
chilton of the canadian air force 
the system gains its extraordinary reach by bouncing radar 
signals off the earths ionosphere enabling the radar to hopscotch 
over the planets curve that layer of the atmosphere is also 
responsible for bouncing shortwave radio signals around the world 
the radar signal begins its journey from three 3600footlong 
antenna arrays in the western maine town of moscow return signals 
bouncing back from aircraft are picked up 100 miles away by three 
receivers each nearly a mile long in the town of columbia falls 
a similar overthehorizon system with components in california 
idaho and oregon is 90 percent complete and is expected to come on 
line in about a year its range will be a half donutshaped area 
across the pacific from alaska to south of baja mexico 
the planned central system with components in north dakota 
south dakota and minnesota will focus on the southern part of the 
continent an alaskan system will point toward the western part of 
the soviet union 
the system is not effective directly north of the continent 
because of electrical disturbances in the atmosphere that produce 
the northern lights conventional radar guards against intruders 
from the north

the trial of a man accused of falsely 
claiming that george bush sought an armsforhostages deal from 
iranians 10 years ago was halted today after he was hospitalized 
with chest pains 
richard brenneke was in fair condition in st vincent hospital amp 
medical center where he was taken tuesday night hours after 
testimony in his trial got under way he has a history of heart 
problems 
brenneke claims thenvice presidential candidate bush met in 
paris with iranians a couple of weeks before the 1980 election in 
hopes of freeing the americans held in the tehran embassy and 
boosting ronald reagans presidential campaign 
brenneke 48 a lake oswego businessman is charged in federal 
court with one count of lying under oath and could face up to five 
years in prison and a 10000 fine if convicted 
assistant us attorney thomas orourke said in his opening 
statement tuesday that he would show that brenneke lied when he 
testified about the alleged meeting and when he said he and another 
man were contract employees of the cia 
brennekes lawyer michael scott told the jury in his opening 
statements that reagan campaign officials were scared pea green 
that president jimmy carter would succeed in winning freedom 
before the presidential election for the americans taken hostage in 
tehran in 1979 
the reagan administration years later sold arms to iran as part 
of a scheme that benefited the nicaraguan contras and resulted in 
freedom for some hostages taken in lebanon in the 1980s but reagan 
has denied even that exchange was an armsforhostages deal 
brenneke a reputed private arms dealer who also claims to have 
knowledge of the irancontra deal made his disputed allegations 
while testifying in september 1988 at the federal trial of heinrich 
rupp a colorado gold dealer who was convicted of bank fraud 
brenneke claimed he and rupp had both worked for the cia and 
that rupp flew bush the late cia director william casey and 
donald p gregg now the us ambassador to south korea to paris 
for the alleged meeting brenneke said it took place oct 1920 
1980 at the time casey was reagans campaign chairman and gregg 
was a bush adviser and national security council employee 
at tuesdays trial gregg and several other witnesses said the 
people allegedly involved in the paris meeting never left the 
country at the time it was taking place 
gregg testified that he was vacationing with his wife and 
daughter at a friends house at bethany beach del at the time 
brenneke claims the secret talks were held gregg showed snapshots 
taken during the vacation and said it consisted mostly of seafood 
dinners swimming tennis reading and naps 
brennekes name surfaced from time to time during the 
irancontra affiar 
he told the new york times in november 1986 about the time the 
affair first became public that government sources told him early 
that year that the defense department was planning to use profits 
from the sale of arms to iran to help the rebels in nicaragua 
brennekes name first surfaced publicly in february 1984 when an 
advertisement appeared in a central american newspaper saying he 
had arms for sale he claimed at the time that he had never 
authorized or placed the ad

israel broke ground for a new 
jewish settlement wednesday in the judean desert where bulldozers 
pushed aside rocks and a crane hoisted seven mobile homes into the 
clearing on a hilltop 
also wednesday officials said attorney general yosef harishs 
office filed a brief with the supreme court urging the immediate 
eviction of 150 jewish settlers from the christian arab quarter in 
jerusalems walled old city 
enlisting the support of jerusalem mayor teddy kollek and police 
commander rahamim comfort the attorney general argued that the 
continued presence of jewish settlers could provoke violence 
the supreme court is expected to rule thursday on appeals by the 
settlers to set aside lower court rulings ordering their eviction 
from a 72room complex owned by the greek orthodox patriarchate 
settlement activity has stepped up significantly since march 15 
when hardline prime minister yitzhak shamir took the reins of a 
caretaker government previously the centerleft labor party had 
acted as a brake on settlements but the laborlikud coalition 
collapsed march 15 
the settlement campaign has had farreaching repercussions 
straining israels relations with the united states and endangering 
a 400 million housing loan request for soviet jewish immigrants 
it has brought protests from american jewish groups and even 
cast a shadow over the fate of western hostages held in lebanon by 
shiite moslem groups 
in alon jewish settlers raised glasses in a toast and watched 
as bulldozers smoothed the rocky ground for the mobile homes 
in five years there will be a big city here settler leader 
eliyakim haetzni said gesturing toward the barren hills 
surrounding alon it is halfway between jerusalem and the biblical 
town of jericho in the jordan valley 
another settler leader moshe waysman said 10 families and a 
few bachelors would move into alon on wednesday and that six more 
mobile homes would be added in the next few days 
we want to live together in a pleasant environment to have 
some land around our houses and to have a higher standard of 
living waysman said 
the coalition agreement of the former likudlabor government 
called for eight new settlements to be built by 1992 but it did 
not include alon 
however shamir spokesman avi pazner insisted the construction 
did not violate the agreement saying alon is merely an expansion 
of the settlement of kfar adumim but the sites are a mile apart 
and no road connects them 
leftwing legislators including dedi zucker of the citizens 
rights movement accused shamir of exploiting the period of 
political uncertainty to push through settlement plans 
in the past two weeks the government has authorized 
construction of the dugit settlement in the occupied gaza strip 
and reportedly allowed preparation of four more settlements that 
were stalled while labor was in the ruling coalition 
in jerusalem the police commander warned that continued 
presence of the settlers in the christian arab quarter of the old 
city in the face of courtordered eviction may in itself be an 
inciting factor in this sensitive area 
every event in the area has influence on the fabric of 
relations problematic these days between members of different 
religions and faiths comfort said according to an official who 
read portions of the document to the associated press the document 
was filed with the attorney generals brief 
the old city is on land captured from jordan during the 1967 
middle east war it is divided into separate districts for moslems 
jews and christians 
the settlers moved into st johns hospice april 11 claiming 
they had subleased the fourbuilding complex from an armenian 
christian tenant 
the greek orthodox church says the lease is illegal the church 
has been supported by two lower courts in its efforts to evict the 
settlers

riot police broke up a demonstration 
wednesday by striking nurses who gathered outside the health 
ministry to press their demands for better wages and working 
conditions 
several nurses were taken by truck to the central police station 
in downtown harare for a talk with police officials said a police 
spokesman 
the spokesman who by custom was not identified denied any of 
the nurses had been arrested he said that they had been removed 
from the health ministry so they could be advised about the 
legality of their actions 
it is illegal for zimbabweans employed in essential services to 
strike police authorization is routinely required for protests 
junior nurses have been staging a series of work stoppages since 
april 8 demanding better wages and working conditions 
the ministry of health offered unspecified pay increases april 
21 but most nurses vowed not to resume work until the raises were 
confirmed in writing 
on tuesday armed riot police with dogs forced hundreds of 
striking nurses off the grounds of hospitals and clinics in 
bulawayo the countrys secondlargest city 
church officials appealed to the nurses wednesday to return to 
work the call came after mission workers in northeastern zimbabwe 
blamed the nurses action for the death of a man wounded by 
mozambique rebels in a crossborder attack 
the man allegedly bled to death after being turned away by 
nurses at a provincial hospital 55 miles northeast of harare the 
capital 
health authorities have disputed the allegations saying the 
wounded man was treated by doctors at bindura hospital and could 
not have been saved 
last year scores of doctors were arrested for striking over 
poor pay and working conditions they were jailed briefly under 
state of emergency laws

census workers turn to doortodoor counting 
thursday with the bureau facing escalating costs and criticism of 
its efforts so far this year 
only 63 percent of the nations households have responded by 
mail leaving the census takers the task of driving riding and 
walking to the remainder of homes 
original plans had anticipated a 70 percent response and the 
shortfall could help add 150 million or more to the projected 13 
billion cost of the 1990 census 
the work beginning thursday covers more than 100 metropolitan 
areas across the nation as counters try to track down folks who 
either didnt get a census form or failed to mail theirs back 
individual counting expands to an additional 300 smaller 
communities may 3 census officials report 
in rural areas which were not included in the mail portion of 
the count personal visits by census takers have been going on 
since march 
the national head count began in march with the mailing of more 
than 95 million census forms 
the official counters can be identified by their red white and 
blue identification badges and satchels the bureau reported 
although the housetohouse count is now starting government 
officials continue to encourage americans to mail back forms if 
they have not done so 
counting americans at home will continue at least through june 
officials report longer if needed 
members of congress have been highly critical of the early 
census effort noting that large areas of some big cities have been 
overlooked in the mail count 
in addition a coalition of cities and interest groups has filed 
suit against the bureau contending that minorities are being 
undercounted and seeking to force a statistical adjustment of the 
final census figures

solidarity ended its national congress 
wednesday after an allnight session attended by chairman lech 
walesa who said the union now is united to face polands problems 
now we have the mandate we are organized for when life brings 
its problems said a proud walesa from the rostrum as the 
congress ended at 8 am 
the sevenday congress the trade unions second reelected 
walesa as chairman it also approved a new charter and program and 
chose a 96member national commission ending longsimmering 
disputes about the legitimacy of solidaritys leadership structure 
after the chaos caused by martial law in 1981 
the new program calls for solidarity to concentrate mainly on 
trade union issues while not withdrawing totally from its role as a 
broad political movement the union retains the option to create 
its own political party if it sees the need 
the solutions are not perfect but in the present situation 
perfect solutions do not exist walesa said 
the essence of the congress was when a chance lies ahead for 
the country to be united and organized as a practical person i 
am happy about this he said 
the congress gave an overwhelming vote of confidence to walesas 
leadership since the unions first congress in october 1981 he has 
guided the union from its years as an underground organization 
through the long negotiations that led to its regaining legal 
status a year ago 
the same negotiations opened the door to a solidarityled 
government for poland which led the wave of reform in the east 
bloc 
the position of walesa is now really indisputable said one 
warsaw delegate marcin przybylowicz 
still walesa did come under criticism for his authoritarian 
style of leadership during the debates in closing remarks he 
appeared to be trying to make amends 
this congress brought a few surprises it did not go exactly 
along with my concept but i never took the floor even though my 
tongue was jumping out because i did not want to disturb 
democracy he said 
many delegates emerged from the meeting convinced walesa is 
planning a bid for polands presidency using the union as a base 
walesa has been evasive in discussing his presidential plans 
president wojciech jaruzelskis term ends in 1995 the congress 
however passed a resolution calling for new parliamentary and 
presidential elections by the spring of 1991 
he is citizen no 1 in this country and if the alternative is 
jaruzelski of course it is great if he runs said delegate jan 
waszkiewicz of walesa 
but other union members appeared disappointed at the prospect 
myself and others would feel cheated if he ran for the 
chairman of the union with the intention of becoming president 
said alojzy pietrzyk the miners leader for the region of silesia 
walesa and the new national commission were elected to serve a 
threeyear term and the next national solidarity congress is to be 
held in one year 
the congress took place in a calm atmosphere that contrasted 
sharply with its last stormy 18day meeting in 1981 that took 
place under a barrage of hostile criticism from communist 
authorities in warsaw moscow and other east bloc capitals 
in 1981 crowds gathered outside the oliva sports hall to be 
close to the debates there were no similar displays of enthusiasm 
this time with life in gdansk proceeding normally 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and deputy prime minister 
leszek balcerowicz architect of polands stringent economic reform 
program made appearances at the congress 
but relations between solidarity and the government it helped 
create remained uneasy a minority of delegates advocated the union 
make a clean break with the governments painful economic policies 
and concentrate on protecting workers interests

president bush appealed anew wednesday for a 
lineitem veto and broader power to rescind funds congress has 
appropriated 
the president needs the power to make the tough calls on 
spending take the heat and im perfectly prepared to do that 
said bush also urging that the constitution be amended to require 
a balanced budget 
he said seven of his predecessors had requested lineitem veto 
authority which congress refused to grant a total of 43 governors 
already possess such power 
the government this year is running a deficit of 150 billion 
bush has proposed a 63 billion deficit for next years budget 
bush was surrounded by republican lawmakers cabinet officers 
and budget chief richard darman during a brief white house ceremony 
at which as he signed messages sending his proposed changes to 
capitol hill 
his threepart strategy entails 
a proposed constitutional amendment giving the president 
lineitem veto authority 
support for a legislative line item veto act which would widen 
his power to rescind funds already appropriated by congress 
endorsement of the balanced budget amendment introduced by sen 
strom thurmond rsc 
under current law a president can only veto an entire piece of 
legislation the president cannot excise particular expenditures 
the white house finds objectionable 
bush said he needs a way to avoid unnecessary expenditures 
without sacrificing entire legislative enactments 
the legislative line item veto act would strengthen the 
presidents hand in rescinding funds already appropriated by 
congress 
congress can reject a presidential rescission simply by 
inaction bush said noting a 1974 recission law and thats 
precisely whats happened to the vast majority of rescission 
proposals 
i ask congress to require an up or down vote on presidential 
rescissions

a house agriculture subcommittee wednesday 
approved a foreign trade section of the 1990 farm bill that would 
allow food giveaways to needy countries 
the legislation is similar to the senate measure on foreign 
trade approved in committee earlier this month the farm bill will 
set agriculture policy for the next five years 
the major difference between the two bills is the way the food 
aid programs would be managed within the government according to a 
house subcommittee spokeswoman 
both bills would allow the president to give food to countries 
whose governments he wants to encourage such as those in eastern 
europe such assistance now must be in the form of a sale 
the bills also allow the united states to forgive the debts of 
financially strapped countries trying to restructure their 
economies 
both the house and the senate followed bush administration 
recommendations in writing their bills 
ann veneman deputy undersecretary for international affairs and 
commodity programs said the chief difference the administration 
has with either bill is in the language dealing with the export 
enhancement program 
the program offers exporters bonuses for sales of certain 
products to particular countries and is used to reduce the cost of 
us goods in the international marketplace 
the senate bill says the agriculture department must spend at 
least 900 million in fiscal 1991 on the program the house version 
requires that 500 million be spent 
the administration does not want any specific dollar amount 
named 
its a tradepolicy tool veneman said adding that the 
amount spent should be the prerogative of the administration

chinese premier li peng whose hardline 
government cracked down on protesters clamoring for democracy one 
year ago said wednesday he is sure that this spring will be silent 
speaking at a news conference during the first visit to the 
soviet union by a chinese head of government in 26 years li also 
acknowledged the fall of communism in eastern europe but he said 
it was too early to say whether those nations would abandon 
socialism 
he termed his moscow visit a success because both nations agreed 
to reduce military forces along their common border and continue 
goodneighborly friendly relations although there was a hint 
the two longtime communist rivals could not reach a complete 
agreement 
a year ago this month protesters in beijings tiananmen square 
set off a push for democracy that led to demonstrations across 
china the protests overshadowed the visit to beijing by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev a visit that ended three decades of 
strained relations 
some believe that in april may or june of this year more 
disturbances will affect china but i am sure that nothing of that 
sort will happen li said 
the army killed hundreds of protesters on june 34 in beijing 
china has since arrested thousands of dissenters and tightened 
controls on society 
last year this time around i concentrated on handling these 
very delicate issues he said now i am on an official visit to 
the soviet union which means that the political situation in our 
country is stable 
asked whether chinas handling of the demonstrators in tiananmen 
square could be a model for gorbachev in his confrontation with the 
breakaway baltic republic of lithuania li refused to answer 
i think this question was directed to the wrong address its 
of him gorbachev that you should ask such questions he said 
responding to another question li did acknowledge minor 
unrest in the western province of xinjiang beijings first 
admission of the incident regional television has reported 22 
people were killed in rioting april 56 in the town of akto saying 
it was caused by moslems trying to start a holy war 
li did not give a casualty toll but said the situation has 
stabilized 
he said he expects china to maintain relations with the 
countries in eastern europe whether they will abandon socialism 
or whether they will uphold the principles of socialism 
yet in a sign that china and the soviet union could not resolve 
all their differences during the summit meeting li said there 
would be no customary joint communique 
no such statement would be issued li said because his fourday 
visit was so short and more time and effort would be needed to 
work out a communique he said that each sides concluding 
statement thursday would have no radical differences 
li said china agreed to grant state credits to the soviet union 
to buy 333 million worth of chinese consumer goods such as 
textiles and other unspecified light industry products the soviet 
union suffers from chronic shortages of basic consumer goods 
the soviet union will provide a credit to china to build two 
nuclear power stations that will generate 1 million megawatts each 
he said 
the 61yearold premier who studied engineering in moscow from 
1948 to 1954 said the two nations had economies that 
complemented one another and enabled them to reach the 
agreements 
the military agreement provides for the mutual reduction of 
armed forces and military confidencebuilding measures along the 
two countries 4350mile border the nations have been negotiating 
the troop reductions for years

czechoslovak president vaclav havel on 
wednesday briefed prime minister yitzhak shamir on a meeting he had 
with the leader of the plo and offered his help in mediating 
between israel and the palestinians 
shamir who opposes any dealings with the plo did not appear to 
take havel up on his offer 
havel who on his arrival earlier wednesday became the first 
eastern european leader to visit the jewish state met with plo 
chief yasser arafat in prague this month 
havel said he has a great interest in this conflict and 
would like to help but he knows it is complicated we did not 
discuss any specific steps that could be taken by czechoslovakia in 
this respect shamir told reporters 
havel told me briefly about his meeting with arafat shamir 
said he refused to elaborate 
havel 54 a playwright and former dissident was quoted by the 
hebrew daily haaretz as saying arafat assured him that the 
palestine liberation organization wants israel to adopt us 
proposals for starting a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
arafat stressed repeatedly that he attaches great hopes to my 
peace mission havel said but added he could not vouch for 
arafats sincerity 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner said no dialogue was possible 
with arafat either directly or through intermediarie 
what arafat wants is the disappearance of israel therefore 
we dont want to have any dialogue with mr arafat not direct or 
indirect pazner told the associated press 
referring to havel he added even if our friend has the best 
of intentions we will not take him up on that 
havel also met with foreign minister moshe arens and shimon 
peres head of the centerleft labor party labor which supports 
the us peace proposals is trying to form a new government 
shamir indicated he asked the czechoslovak leader to allow 
prague to serve as a transit point for flights of soviet jewish 
immigrants bound for israel 
we discussed our interest in the help from czechoslovakia in 
the efforts to resolve the questions of the immigration of 
jewish people from the soviet union to israel shamir said 
without elaboration 
yosef govrin a senior israeli foreign ministry official said 
talks are under way on air connections and that flights could start 
by summer 
czechoslovakia has said it has been unable to serve as a transit 
point because it was unable to provide the necessary security arab 
militants have threatened to disrupt flights through east europe to 
block the influx of soviet jews to israel 
czechoslovakia and other eastern european states with the 
exception of romania followed the kremlins lead in cutting ties 
with israel after the 1967 middle east war in which israel seized 
land from moscows arab allies 
but israel now has full diplomatic ties with romania poland 
hungary and czechoslovakia as well as lowlevel ties with the 
soviet union negotiations are under way with east germany and 
bulgaria

an underdog democrat told a tall tale to get 
campaign advice from the ohio congressman he wants to replace and 
now hes hoping to pick up votes by revealing the ruse 
ricky lee mattox 28 admits he posed as an inquisitive college 
student to get republican rep donald buz lukens to offer an 
insiders insights on running for congress 
he confided in me tactics about his first and second campaigns 
that i thought were brilliant the political neophyte said 
with just two weeks to go before ohios primary elections 
mattox said he decided to come clean about the scheme because he 
felt guilty and to attract attention to his lowbudget candidacy 
the subterfuge occurred in february when lukens agreed to meet 
the undercover mattox for breakfast to discuss wining campaign 
strategies 
i came out of the meeting with a lot of respect for him 
mattox said ive never met anyone with as much political 
knowledge 
lukens who is fighting for his political life after his may 
1989 conviction for having sex with a teenage girl remembered the 
tutorial with the 28yearold 
he seemed receptive he seemed like a nice guy the 
incumbent said 
i am a little surprised that ricky would go to that extent 
lukens said if he had just told me he was ricky mattox i would 
have given the same advice 
mattox wasnt the first candidate to seek his advice lukens 
said the congressman said hes advised seven or eight candidates 
over the past year and in 1986 the eventual democratic nominee 
for lukens seat went to lukens before the primary seeking advice 
the congressman said 
it happens more often than you think he said 
mattox who is making his first bid for elective office 
maintained he had nowhere else to turn as a democratic candidate in 
a district that had sent republicans to congress for a generation 
i wasnt receiving any advice from the democratic party 
here he said 
i wanted advice on campaigning and buz lukens even though 
people despise him hes a very good politician 
as it turned out mattox ignored much of what lukens told him 
but lukens appears to be taking his own advice as he awaits the 
outcome of his appeal of a misdemeanor conviction for contributing 
to the unruliness of a minor 
lukens has been visible in his district making the rounds of 
serviceclub breakfasts farm group meetings and other small 
gatherings his mother edith maintains a similar schedule 
while in the district lukens said we try to average 22 to 27 
events a day as for his mother she sometimes has 20 events 
herself 
lukens has steered clear of republican meetings and candidate 
forums since his official stance is that hes waiting for the 10th 
ohio district court of appeals to rule on his appeal 
mattox made one other preprimary confession saying he has been 
deliberately misleading about the temporary parttime job he took 
to make ends meet during the campaign 
the former navy missile technician a structural engineer by 
training routinely describes himself as a database operator for 
essenza corp he works for an essenza subsidiary sds pizza 
punching ordering information and badcheck records into the 
pizzerias computers for 4 an hour

soviets and americans met again by 
the river elbe on wednesday marveling at the imminent unity of 
germany exactly 45 years after they helped cut it in two 
under gray skies and a light drizzle about 100 world war ii 
veterans watched a solemn ceremony as a wreath was laid in the 
grassy river delta where the armies of two invading nations came 
together 
soviet and us veterans wearing medals from the historic 
military campaign clasped hands embraced and traded war stories in 
the first elbe reunion held on free german soil 
both armies invaded torgau as they drove through germany from 
opposite ends formally linking up april 25 1945 
william robertson 66 was credited with leading one of two us 
army scout patrols that made the first contact with the soviet 
forces 
to us veterans its a very big deal but it probably isnt to 
most americans said the retired physician from culver city 
calif 
but the elbe meeting touches something very deep in the hearts 
of the soviets he added 
the last such reunion was in 1985 and drew about 25000 people 
it was orchestrated by the soviets and the thencommunist east 
german government the united states criticized it as a propaganda 
extravaganza 
the gathering wednesday was more lowkey and attracted a crowd 
of only about 2000 people to the river bank on the edge of this 
aging town 75 miles southeast of berlin 
veterans marveled at the peaceful revolt that ousted east 
germanys hardline government the popular uprising opened the way 
for democratic government and eventual unification with west 
germany 
the reunion wednesday was planned in june 1989 when such events 
were unthinkable 
its very confusing for some of us older people there has 
been a lot going on said soviet veteran nikolai sagoruko 76 a 
former member of a soviet minesweeping force but we think good 
things are happening and hope it means peace 
soviets turned out in their green red army uniforms their 
chests packed with medals and one little us flag americans wore 
baseball caps and blueandwhite jackets 
two small american scout troops made contact with two small 
soviet patrols along the river on that historic day in 1945 but it 
was the group robertson led that set up the meeting of commanders 
from the two armies 
the others were first but we got the glory the newspaper 
clippings said robertson they had communications problems and 
nobody knew they made contact until the next day 
retired lt gen vladimir orloe leader of the soviet veterans 
contingent said conflicting claims also existed between the two 
soviet patrols about which was the first to make contact 
ivan krutcheno 72 said he was part of the first group of 
soviet scouts 
we came here and saw americans and we thought we were in 
america we had traveled for so long he said 
the veterans gathered at a cemetery to lay a wreath at the 
graves of soviet soldiers killed in torgau they later placed a 
wreath on the grave of joseph polowsky an american soldier who won 
unusual acclaim in the soviet union with his efforts to arrange the 
periodic torgau reunions 
polowsky a new york city cab driver who died in 1983 insisted 
he be buried at torgau 
he just thought it was so beautiful here said bill beswick 
65 of west point va who was a pallbearer at polowskys funeral 
and one of the first soldiers to reach the elbe 
leonard addorisio 66 of hartford conn said he was amazed at 
the camaraderie shown by the soviet veterans 
everyone is so good so friendly you wonder why there are 
wars he said

france will continue to honor sanctions imposed by 
the european economic community against libya in 1986 despite 
libyas role in the freeing of a french hostage foreign minister 
roland dumas said wednesday 
the decisions of the eec are respected and applied dumas 
said in response to questions in the national assembly france is 
waiting for new decisions to be taken before changing its 
stance 
the eec imposed a range of sanctions in 1986 citing libyan 
backing for terrorist groups 
frenchwoman jacqueline valente fernand houtekins of belgium and 
their daughter sophieliberte were freed in beirut on april 10 by 
members of fatahrevolutionary council a radical palestinian group 
led by abu nidal the group is backed by libya 
france has no official contact with the hostagetakers and 
engaged in statetostate negotiations in order to obtain the 
hostages release dumas said 
there was widespread criticism in the western media when dumas 
praised libyas leader col moammar gadhafi for a 
humanitarian gesture in pushing for the hostages release some 
french newspapers have asserted that the hostages in fact were 
seized by libyan forces and only later turned over to abu nidals 
group 
dumas rejected as hypocritical the accusations that france is 
being too conciliatory toward libya he asserted that 5000 britons 
were working in libyas petrochemical industry and said west 
germany italy japan and south korea all had more economic ties 
with libya than france had 
dumas for the first time gave a chronological summary of the 
contacts that led to the hostages release 
he said the french government in july 1988 asked moroccos king 
hassan ii to confer with gadhafi about the hostages this led to a 
meeting in morocco between french and libyan representatives 
dumas said france also obtained help from president hosni 
mubarak of egypt who discussed the matter with gadhafi in february 
on april 4 gadhafi publicly appealed for the release of ms 
valente and her family 
french officials have denied any connection between the 
hostages release and frances decision in march to allow the 
delivery of three frenchmade warplanes to libya after a fouryear 
embargo libya had purchased the planes previously but they were 
back in france for repairs when french officials decided to block 
their return

the food and drug administration will 
reconsider its longstanding opposition to home aids test kits 
officials said wednesday 
some people say it would encourage more people to be tested 
for aids and if they test positive and got into the medical 
system they could get early treatment said dr paul parkman 
director of the fdas center for biologics evaluation and research 
im not sure all that will happen but thats how we want to 
evaluate the system 
fda officials said they were persuaded to rethink their 
opposition because of medical advances in treatment such as use of 
azt to slow the progression of the disease in its early stages 
parkman said the fda still has concerns about the home kits 
which would enable people to send a small blood sample to a 
laboratory and get the results by telephone 
its not a sure thing this is not tantamount to saying the 
fda is going to approve this parkman said 
were still being cautious we think its an area that can be 
studied to see if the risks outweigh the benefits and whether the 
product can be used effectively 
also wednesday the fda licensed the first test kit that detects 
antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 or hiv2 a 
second but rare cause of aids 
only 17 cases of hiv2 infection have been reported in the 
united states most hiv2 infections have occurred in west africa 
and central africa 
the virus is spread the same way as hiv1 primarily through 
sexual contact with an infected partner sharing needles with an 
infected iv drug user and contaminated blood and blood products 
parkman said the fda isnt requiring blood banks to use the 
hiv2 test now because the virus isnt considered a threat to the 
us blood supply blood banks screen blood for hiv1 antibodies 
and dont accept blood from immigrants from subsaharan africa 
an fda advisory committee last week recommended the agency lift 
its ban on blood donations from black african immigrants if a blood 
bank tests for hiv2 as well as hiv1 
parkman said the fda has accepted one application for a home 
aids test kit from university hospital laboratories corp in 
bethesda md however he said a lawsuit filed by the company last 
month seeking to force the fda to accept its application had no 
effect on the decision 
the lawsuit was settled april 10 said elliott millenson 
president of university hospital laboratories which filed its fda 
application in december 1987 
i think our lawsuit forced the fda to reexamine the issue 
but im delighted with the decison he said 
the fda has sent letters about the policy change to about 30 
other companies that are developing test kits or have expressed 
interest in doing so parkman said 
until now the fda has refused to accept home test kit 
applications because of technical concerns such as how well people 
could be instructed with written material to draw their own blood 
and whether samples could be shipped safely through the mail 
the agency also worried about how people using the tests would 
be counseled about the disease 
one technical innovation that has eased fda officials minds 
about home testing is a process by which a small amount of blood 
drawn with a finger prick can be stored on a sheet of filter paper 
and sent to a laboratory

discoverys astronauts overcame 
balky equipment to send the hubble space telescope floating free 
from the shuttle today on a 15year quest for secrets of the 
universe 
the 15 billion telescope began orbiting earth every 973 
minutes at an altitude of 380 miles high above the atmosphere 
which has limited the view of groundbased telecopes 
discovery go for hubble release mission control told the 
crew at 337 pm edt the event occurred a minute later as the 
shuttle slowly and carefully backed away 
the final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground 
controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels 
that power the telescopes instruments 
the starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its 
reel mission control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready 
to go out of the cabin to help but there was a third try and it 
was successful 
we have confirmation that the solar array wing on the 
starboard side has been deployed the telescope control center in 
maryland said 
so we have good news said dave drachlis of the hubble 
control center 
the deployment of the two 39foot panels allowed sun power to 
flow into the telescopes batteries relieving worries that they 
would use up their eighthour charge 
before astronaut steve hawley was able to lift the 12ton 
telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttles mechanical arm its 
instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttles power and 
shifted over to the batteries 
precisely one day after lifting off from launch pad 39b at 
kennedy space center the hubble space telescope is ready to fly on 
its own mission controls jeffrey carr said the game has 
begun the race is on the clock is ticking 
astronauts kathryn sullivan and bruce mccandless put on 
spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk 
outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the 
solar panels failed 
cameras aboard discovery showed the telescope being held at the 
end of a 50foot crane reflecting sunlight from its silver surface 
and a turning earth in the background 
earlier this morning discovery commander loren j shriver 
maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position with its nose 
pointed toward the sun that was to put the telescopes solar 
arrays once unfurled at the proper angle to quickly start 
collecting energy and protect the telescopes fixed star trackers 
while the instrument was being held above the payload bay 
discovery is in orbit 380 miles above earth 70 miles higher 
than any previous shuttle the orbit was dictated by the need to 
put the telescope above the earths distorting atmosphere 
for those technically inclined this morning id like to pass 
on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer hawley 
something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away 
today shriver said 
the five astronauts busy day began on a musical note early this 
morning as mission control played a song called space is our 
world written by members of discoverys training team and a 
houstonarea group private numbers 
controllers monitoring the telescope at goddard space flight 
center in maryland said tuesday that no problems had been detected 
so far aboard hubble the most expensive and complex unmanned 
spacecraft ever built 
everything has just being going like clockwork said ron 
schlagheck shift director of orbital verifications at goddard 
everybody is in excellent spirits 
the hubble telescope delayed by technical problems and the 1986 
challenger accident has waited seven years to take its place in 
space it finally got a ride into orbit tuesday morning aboard 
discovery 
hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so 
distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach earth it 
is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe 
and it may solve the mysteries of quasars pulsars and black holes 
and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support 
life 
the 24250pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in 
diameter about the size of a railroad tank car when it is in 
orbit it will receive electrical power for its six scientific 
instruments from two winglike solar arrays 
it is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble whose 
discovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave rise 
to the big bang theory that the universe was created by a 
tremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago

president mikhail s gorbachev traveled to the 
depths of russia on wednesday to ease soviets fears about the 
transition to a market economy but also got an earful of complaints 
about empty store shelves 
after a day of chats with workers in sverdlovsk an industrial 
center 870 miles east of moscow gorbachev admitted its 
apparent that the peoples expectations are at their limit their 
patience is at a limit 
the kremlin chief said he made the trip his first since he was 
elected to the expanded post of executive president last month to 
see how people feel about planned economic reforms 
major social unrest including strikes are feared if the 
government carries out a preliminary plan to free prices establish 
a stock exchange close inefficient industries and move toward 
making the ruble a freely convertible currency 
inflation and unemployment could result from the phasing out of 
price subsidies and the closure of unprofitable factories 
officials have said an economic safety net will be set up to 
help lowincome families cope with the blows 
gorbachev assured the sverdlovsk workers no final decisions had 
been made and wont be until may 10 the changes themselves are six 
to eight months away he added 
someone is throwing out the idea that somebody at the top 
wants to raise prices to introduce shock therapy dont believe 
it he told a huge crowd gathered outside the gigantic uralmash 
machinebuilding complex 
nothing he told the crowd will be done behind their backs 
reports on gorbachevs first day in sverdlovsk filled a 
halfhour of soviet tvs nightly newscast vremya that ensured 
a wide audience among this countrys 280 million people would see 
their leaders attempts to soften the blow of radical economic 
reform 
gorbachev faced a storm of criticism from the crowd surrounding 
him over the shortages of fruits and vegetables a tv correspondent 
said the region ranks second in production in the russian 
federation but 40th or 50th in housing hospitals schools and 
cultural establishments the reporter noted 
about 11000 of uralmashs workers are living without adequate 
housing another correspondent said 
conspicuously absent from the tv coverage of gorbachevs visit 
and perhaps indicating the leaderships sensitivity to direct 
criticism was footage of the crowd complaining to the president 
such complaints were reported by the official news agency tass 
tass said uralmash workers also complained that there were no tv 
sets and refrigerators in local stores and asked gorbachev why 
sverdlovsk residents dont see the goods they produce on store 
shelves 
everything that worries you worries me too gorbachev 
responded many problems have accumulated we must undo them 
soundly all together we are approaching that now introducing 
structural changes including every enterprise every person in the 
economic reform 
gorbachev advised workers to brace for a painful stage in 
economic reform and appealed for help 
we there must act more wisely and you here must work more 
wisely otherwise nothing will come of it he said some workers 
hung out windows and others jumped in the crowd as they strained to 
hear their president 
foreign reporters were not allowed toaccompany gorbachev to 
sverdlovsk a closed city that is the home ground of maverick 
communist politician boris n yeltsin and a center for rock music 
sverdlovsk residents have taken to the streets with their 
complaints several times over the past months including a prenew 
years protest over a shortage of vodka 
party officials stopped the protests by flooding the stores with 
reserves of vodka but many of the citys 14 million residents 
remain unhappy about the lack of other rationed items including 
meat sugar and butter the soviet press has reported 
sverdlovsk is also one of several russian centers where 
communist party members recently ousted their local chief and 
replaced him with a more progressive leader

courtordered secrecy agreements are helping 
hide information about dangerous products environmental hazards 
medical malpractice and unfair business practices according to 
consumers lawyers and journalists attending a conference wednesday 
but proponents of the agreements argued that the accords are 
private and should be maintained that they are necessary to 
protect manufacturers trade secrets and american competitiveness 
in international markets and that the civil court system is not 
designed to disseminate information obtained in litigation 
information gathered during a lawsuit can be kept secret through 
protective orders confidentiality agreements or judicial sealing 
of files 
such arrangements prohibit lawsuit participants from 
distributing information they obtain limit what can be shared with 
others not involved in the lawsuit or make all records in a case 
unavailable to the public 
in some cases even the names of people or companies involved in 
a suit are kept secret with the court record titled sealed vs 
sealed 
secrecy buries critical facts and the public good is 
ignored and damaged by such practices said russ herman 
president of the association of trial lawyers of america as he 
opened the conference 
in far too many of these cases were not talking about 
irrelevant facts better left in the files of the litigants said 
paul mcmasters deputy editorial director of usa today 
were talking about documents and decisions involving unsafe 
products dangerous drugs toxic wastes all with potentially 
devastating effect on people unaware of the danger added 
mcmasters who heads the freedom of information committee of the 
society of professional journalists cosponsor of wednesdays 
conference 
but james morris iii a virginia attorney argued that the 
practice isnt limited to corporate information 
youre personal papers are also in those files he warned 
if you can summons my medical records from my doctor my diary 
from my psychiatrist or records of design from a company 
privacy goes out the window said morris 
herman argued that such arrangements keep vital health and 
safety information from the press the regulatory agencies and the 
public 
us businesses are at a competitive disadvantage because 
international agreements dont force foreign companies to release 
the same extensive information countered morris 
opponents of the practice said the agreements have become a 
commonly used threat of lengthy legal battle and tactic to 
bribe injured people and their families into settlement 
a compromise is a compromise countered morris if you sue 
for 24 million and take 6 million you werent bribed 
people who bring lawsuits against companies for potentially 
dangerous products concede to the agreements because they cant 
afford to continue litigation and they want to go on with their 
lives said fred barbee barbees wife carol died after an 
artificial heart valve fractured 
he later learned she might have been saved if emergency room 
doctors had treated her for the fractured valve and not the heart 
attack they thought she was having 
morris said the agreements are private litigation between 
private individuals and companies protected by the first 
amendment 
there is nothing in the first amendment that says you are 
entitled to everything in a court file 
how can you call it private unless you can limit it to my 
family asked barbee 
a proposal backed by the bush administration to create a 
uniform federal standard for imposing punitive damages in product 
liability lawsuits and limit to two years most product liability 
claims is pending in a senate subcommittee

scores of troops and armored cars mounted with cannons moved 
into the towns bello and estrella on wednesday the government 
has sent about 9000 soldiers to the medellin area in its battle 
against the drug barons 
another town on the outskirts of medellin envigado was put 
under military rule last month the police said they are searching 
the area for the head of the medellin cartel pablo escobar 
wednesdays bombing came at 830 am as a truck crept by with 
20 members of colombias antiterrorist strike force aboard 
the blast destroyed a shoe store and a halfdozen automobiles 
and collapsed the roofs on several small stores and houses three 
bodies were found in the rubble of the shoe store the colombian 
radio chain caracol said 
a high school student waiting for a bus also was killed 
the bomb killed four civilians and two policemen and wounded 26 
civilians and eight policemen medellin police chief col humberto 
camero said 
many people aboard an old bus packed with passengers were 
wounded commuters their clothes torn and their bodies bloodied 
pleaded for help as they crawled from the bus shattered windows 
witnesses told caracol 
the medellin cartel has killed 60 medellin policemen so far this 
year in its effort to stop the governments policy of capturing 
drug traffickers and extraditing them to the united states the 
cocaine cartel has offered a reward of 4300 for each policeman 
murdered it is believed to be responsible for shipping much of the 
cocaine that is smuggled into the united states 
the bomb was the largest since april 11 when a car bomb 
exploded on a busy medellin highway and killed 20 people including 
eight members of the antiterrorist police unit more than 100 
people were wounded 
in communiques received by colombian radio stations in the past 
month the cartel has vowed to kill all policemen 
late last year the drug traffickers bombings keyed on the 
capital of bogota killing about 200 people in scores of bombing 
attacks 
the traffickers apparently have switched to medellin because the 
army and police have moved thousands of officers into and around 
medellin to try to find escobar 
an antinarcotics agent speaking on condition of anonymity 
told the associated press that authorities believe escobar is in 
the medellin area he apparently is trying to hold together his 
multibilliondollar drug empire the agent said 
colombia has extradited 15 alleged cartel middlemen to be tried 
in the united states last december police killed the man who was 
the secondmost powerful member of the cartel gonzalo rodriguez

artillery shells slammed into residential 
districts wednesday as rival christian forces exchanged barrages 
killing 13 people and wounding 17 police said 
police said the shells fell on both sides of the green line 
dividing the citys christian and moslem sectors 
five people were killed and four wounded in moslem west beirut 
ambulances sped through the streets as people sought refuge in 
basements and air raid shelters 
west beirut has not been involved in the fighting between the 
lebanese forces militia led by samir geagea and the christian 
troops loyal to gen michel aoun however stray shells frequently 
have fallen in west beirut 
police said howitzer shells rockets and tank cannon rounds also 
hit residential districts in east beirut and the christian 
hinterland north and northeast of the capital 
the clashes raged despite repeated calls by maronite catholic 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir for a ceasefire 
sfeir in an appeal broadcast by local radio stations called on 
both aoun and geagea to stop fighting immediately have mercy on 
the population which has been suffering for a long time 
the latest casualties raised the overall toll to 907 killed and 
2418 wounded since geagea and aoun began their struggle for 
control of the 310squaremile christian enclave on jan 30 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
regulations said aouns gunners concentrated their barrage from 
usmade 155mm howitzers on sea ports controlled by geageas 
militia 
the general is trying to impose a sea blockade on the lebanese 
forces keeping all their ports shut by shellfire the spokesman 
said 
the shelling came two days after geageas gunboats blockaded 
aouns sole sea outlet on the dbaye coast north of beirut 
radio stations controlled by the rival christian forces 
repeatedly interrupted regular programming to broadcast reports 
about the duels and to warn civilians 
the power struggle between geagea and aoun has led to the worst 
fighting among christians in the countrys 15yearold multisided 
civil war it has caused damage estimated at 1 billion 
the clashes also have forced at least 400000 of the 1 million 
people living in the christian enclave to seek refuge in safer 
areas of lebanon or abroad 
aoun does not recognize the syrianbacked president elias hrawi 
he also opposes an arab leaguesponsored peace plan because it does 
not include a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of 40000 syrian 
troops in lebanon 
geagea has recognized hrawi as head of state

two american jewish groups and the arab mayor 
of bethlehem are criticizing israel for financing jewish housing in 
the christian sector of jerusalem 
this could be a precedent for more attacks on church property 
christian and moslem and i think that was a very foolish act 
mayor elias freij said wednesday at a news conference 
he also called the move a stupid thing 
robert j lifton president and henry siegman executive 
director of the american jewish congress expressed outrage over 
the clandestine effort 
in a statement lifton and siegman said the action threatens 
us support of israel and complicates the task of raising money 
from jews around the world to help refuges from the soviet union 
settling in israel 
the antidefamation league a jewish group dedicated to 
promoting civil rights said the action gives ammunition to those 
wishing to upset the religious harmony in the holy city 
the disputed jewish housing is in the christian sector of east 
jerusalem the predominantly arab part of the city israel captured 
from jordanian troops in the 1967 war 
freij called east jerusalem occupied territory and said the 
israeli governments assistance to 150 new jewish soviet immigrants 
to live in a fourbuilding complex owned by the greek orthodox 
church is going to strain the situation to the extreme 
the settlement issue is being decided by israeli courts 
congress has been considering guaranteeing a 400 million loan 
to help resettle soviet jews in israel the bush administration has 
conditioned its support for the legislation now before the senate 
on a condition that israel not use the money to house soviet jews 
in the territories occupied in the 1967 war 
freij a selfdescribed moderate also criticized israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir for not accepting us terms for talks with 
palestinian arabs 
the israelis are good at war he said they are bad when 
it comes to peace they have a complex 
freij denied reports he had been threatened by palestine 
liberation organization chairman yasser arafat or that he ever 
called for a halt to the palestinian rebellion on the west bank and 
in gaza 
i respect him he respects me freij said 
the settling of jewish refugees at st johns hospice was 
criticized monday by the state department as an insensitive and 
provocative act 
david a harris washington representative of the american 
jewish committee said monday his group had expressed serious 
concern to the israeli government over the issue 
and thomas a dine executive director of the american israel 
public affairs committee questioned the timing of the move through 
an emissary to shamir 
dine told the prime minister the israeli government was doing 
great harm to israels standing with the bush administration and 
the american public sources close to the situation reported 
aipac is the largest proisrael lobbying group and over the 
years has managed to stop or stall us arms sales to arab 
countries hostile to israel

customs officials on wednesday began criminal 
proceedings against a british man allegedly involved in developing 
a suspected super gun project for iraq 
christopher cowley was charged with involvement in the attempted 
illegal export of equipment a customs spokesman said 
sheffield forgemasters which made the eight giant tubes that 
the government claims are part of a gun has identified cowley as 
its main contact on the project 
cowley was employed by space research corp based in belgium 
which was founded by cannon designer gerald bull bull a 
canadianborn american citizen was murdered in brussels last month 
bulls son michel bull has said that cowley left the company 
in 1988 the family announced last week that the company was going 
out of business 
customs said cowley was charged with being knowingly concerned 
in the attempted illegal exportation of equipment with intent to 
evade a prohibition in force by virtue of the export of goods 
control order 19871989 
earlier wednesday the trade and industry committee of the house 
of commons said it would hold an inquiry into the alleged gun 
project 
british customs officers seized eight sections of steel pipe 
april 12 at the port of middlesbrough and foreign office minister 
william waldegrave said there is little doubt the cargo was 
intended to be part of a gun 
the iraqi government and sheffield forgemasters said the tubes 
were intended for a petrochemical plant 
sheffield forgemasters said it had government permission to sell 
the pipes to iraq the parliamentary committee said its inquiry 
would cover export controls in relation to iraq 
the british government imposed an arms embargo on iran and iraq 
during their eightyear war and has not lifted it because no formal 
ceasefire has been signed 
customs officers have said the tubes built by sheffield 
forgemasters could be assembled to make a 131footlong gun barrel 
with a bore of about 39 inches 
the company has said that 44 sections of tubing have already 
been delivered to iraq 
a second british company walter somers ltd has also been 
involved in the investigation trucks carrying steel forgings from 
somers were stopped in turkey and greece and greek authorities 
arrested a british driver 
somers has confirmed its order also came from space research in 
brussels both companies have said they approached the government 
department of trade and industry in 1988 for clearance

symbolic gifts of flour and cooking oil the first installment of 
24 million in us food aid for wednesdays presidential 
inauguration of violeta chamorro 
he also brought word that president bush earlier in the day 
approved 25 million in medical supplies because he recognizes 
the suffering of the people of nicaragua 
bush also signed a formal declaration that nicaragua is no 
longer a marxistleninist country restored its quota for sugar 
exports to the united states and made businesses wishing to invest 
in the central american nation eligible for lowcost government 
loans 
quayle the highest ranking us official to visit nicaragua 
sice thenpresident carter in 1979 said mrs chamorro faces 
herculean economic problems as she takes over from daniel 
ortega 
still quayle called mrs chamorros inauguration after his 
11year presidency the miracle of managua 
talking with reporters as he flew to managua the vice president 
said many people thought this day would never happen many 
people thought democracy would never come to nicaragua and yet it 
has 
stopping his motorcade as it headed into the capital from the 
airport quayle told several boys waiting at a dilapidated bus stop 
that the us wants to help you 
the motorcade passed several buildings with antiamerican 
slogans scrawled on their sides as his limousine entered a 
baseball stadium for the inaugural an object apparently a piece 
of trash was hurled toward his car and shouts of murderer 
arose from sections of the stands where ortegas sandinistas were 
seated 
the vice president briefly shook hands with ortega and later 
smiled tightly as ortega in his last speech as president 
denounced closeminded politicians in the united states and 
called on washington to stop dictating policies to nicaragua 
the vice president said afterward that he had only heard 
onethird of ortegas speech claiming a lot had been lost in the 
translation which was provided by a state department translator as 
ortega spoke 
as to ortegas assertion that the united states had dictated 
policies to nicaragua quayle said 
were not dictating our policies to nicaragua the people of 
nicaragua determined their policy and their destiny 
earlier quayle said that if he had the chance to talk with the 
defeated leader he would congratulate him for turning over power 
in a peaceful way and discuss how a responsible opposition 
conducts itself not engaging in intimidation and violence 
the bags of flour and cooking oil quayle carried with him on air 
force two were to be followed later in the day by 1000 tons of 
food being ferried into the country aboard 24 relief trucks 
the food shipments initially flown to a us base in honduras 
were approved by bush shortly after mrs chamorro defeated ortega 
in february some 21 million of the aid was transferred from other 
government relief efforts in addition 17 million in foodstuffs 
was designated for orphans and nicaragua will receive aid from the 
food for progress program 
quayle also brought word that bush had restored the 54000ton 
quota for sugar shipments to the united states suspended by 
thenpresident reagan in 1983 as part of an economic embargo 
against ortegas government and had approved the dispatch of 
medical supplies to hospitals and public health clinics that had 
run short of medicine 
the aid quayle announced wednesday would be dwarfed by 300 
million in recovery aid bush has asked congress to approve for this 
nation of 35 million people 
even if that assistance is approved it has been stalled in the 
senate in a dispute over unrelated legislation quayle said much 
more is needed to bring the nicaraguan economy to its feet 
shes got herculean economic problems people are not only out 
of work but they are pessimistic it will take an international 
effort to rebuild nicaragua 
but he called mrs chamorros victory a moment of triumph and 
recovery and predicted she will be a symbol of unity 
he declined to criticize mrs chamorros decision to retain gen 
humberto ortega the outgoing presidents brother as head of the 
armed forces 
it shows she is trying to reconcile the differences in her 
country its her decision and im certainly not going to second 
guess her he said adding that gen ortega could be helpful in 
recapturing some of the arms they passed out to the sandinistas 
during the transition 
expounding on her election quayle told a small crowd that 
welcomed him at the airport 
the walls are crumbling everywhere as people are saying no 
more dictators no more poverty no more militaries

the justice department has declined to 
prosecute walter e fauntroy the district of columbias delegate 
to congress following a lengthy investigation of payroll practices 
in his office 
fauntroy a democrat who is running for mayor of the nations 
capital disclosed the justice departments decision in a statement 
that was released tuesday 
the justice department also confirmed that it had closed the 
investigation of fauntroys employment of thomas john savage son 
of rep gus savage dill at a time records indicated the younger 
savage was living in chicago 
the justice departments decision removes a cloud that had been 
hanging over fauntroys campaign to succeed mayor marion barry 
the mayoral race was thrown wide open earlier this year when 
barry was arrested on cocaine possession charges barry 
subsequently was indicted on charges of lying to a federal grand 
jury by denying previous drug use 
the mayors arrest in an fbi sting operation came just days 
before he was to announce his candidacy for a fourth term barry 
has since said he will not announce his decision about seeking 
reelection until after his trial set to begin june 4 
the fauntroy probe was begun after the associated press reported 
in december 1988 that the younger savage earned 21398 working for 
fauntroy between september 1987 and june 1988 a period illinois 
records show he was living in chicago to meet residency 
requirements for running for public office 
savage swore on election documents filed in connection with his 
unsuccessful campaign for the illinois legislature that he was 
living in chicago during the period in question 
asked whether the decision not to prosecute fauntroy applied to 
any inquiry into actions by the younger savage justice department 
spokesman david runkel said the action applies only to delegate 
fauntroy he would not elaborate 
following the initial stories fauntroy denied any wrongdoing 
and said savage worked as the midwest coordinator for legislation 
that would grant statehood to the district of columbia 
savage said he worked every day that he drew a salary as a 
member of fauntroys staff 
the 15month investigation examined the younger savages 
financial records to determine if he returned any of the money he 
had earned to fauntroy or to his father according to law 
enforcement sources 
a federal grand jury subpoenaed records and took testimony as 
part of the investigation 
fauntroy was informed monday of the justice departments 
decision to close the investigation said his campaign press 
spokesman ivan brandon 
on tuesday fauntroy issued a statement that he was pleased 
that this matter has been closed and that this will no longer have 
to divert attention from the real issues like drugs crime and 
housing that are facing the city

a change in federal labeling for lean beef has 
gone over well with consumers the agriculture department said 
wednesday 
the labeling took effect in november 1987 after consumers and 
industry petitioned usda for a name change in official federal beef 
grading said jimmy wise of the departments agricultural marketing 
service 
consumers told us they wanted a more positive description of 
leaner meat available in grocery stores and they got it he said 
the change involved scrapping the 60yearold usda good 
label and substituting a usda lean label on supermarket cuts 
many nutritionconscious consumers wanted the name change 
because they felt the good label misled buyers into thinking 
the beef was mediocre when the label was established in the 1920s 
it described the amount of fat or marbling in a cut of beef 
a common consumer view was that less fat was more healthful and 
that the good label wasnt very descriptive

soviet jewish immigrants demonstrated wednesday 
near israels parliament accusing the government of failing to 
come up with a clear plan of absorbing the flood of soviet jews 
a senior official at the quasigovernmental jewish agency which 
helps handle immigration said meanwhile that absorption failures 
may lead to an historic mistake of stopping the expected soviet 
jewish influx israel radio reported 
there is no system of decisionmaking and i dont see it being 
formed tomorrow morning agency treasurer meir shitreet said in a 
broadcast lecture 
the immigration has been spurred by growing anxiety over the 
soviet unions future and the spread of antisemitism there as 
well as by us visa restrictions it is expected to total 100000 
this year 
about 24200 soviet jews have arrived so far this year 
according to figures released by absorption minister yitzhak peretz 
and cited by israel radio 
the wave has caused housing shortages and the immigrants also 
face israels increasing unemployment rate and bureaucracy 
the housing ministry is expected to present to the parliament on 
thursday a program of building 32500 apartments for soviet jews 
israel television said it said the program does not include plans 
to build housing in the israelioccupied territories 
the arab world especially has complained that israel plans to 
settle soviet jews in the west bank and gaza strip lands seized

a record 492000 acres of national forest land 
was replanted with trees last year the agriculture department said 
wednesday 
forest service chief f dale robertson said the acreage was the 
most since the national forest system was created in 1905 
robertson said last years effort was due in part to 
rehabilitation work in areas burned by the major fires of 1987 in 
california oregon and washington and to high levels of 
reforestation in areas of 198688 timber harvests in the national 
forests 
of the total area reforested in the fiscal year that ended last 
sept 30 about 307000 acres were directly seeded or planted with 
trees the remaining 185000 acres were reforested through natural 
regeneration by seed falling from nearby trees onto areas prepared 
by the forest service or through sprouting 
robertson said the previous record was 434000 acres reforested 
in 1980 an estimated 460000 acres will be reforested this fiscal 
year he said 
a spokesman said that on the average four or five trees are 
planted for each one harvested that takes into account attrition 
from drought fire disease and other causes as the trees grow 
the forest service manages 191 million acres of forest and

the state department on wednesday advised 
americans to leave liberia because of increased fighting between 
government and rebel forces 
the department also authorized us government personnel and 
their families to leave liberia if they wish 
president bush meanwhile said he will nominate a career 
diplomat peter jon de vos to be the us ambassador to liberia 
the nomination of de vos now principal deputy assistant secretary 
of state in the bureau of oceans and international environmental 
and scientific affairs must be approved by the senate 
the decision comes at a time of growing tension between the two 
countries following the deaths of two americans in recent weeks 
liberias worsening human rights record and its failure to repay 
its debts 
the united states has been cautioning americans to defer 
nonessential travel to liberia since fighting broke out last 
december when the government attacked some 200 rebels it accused of 
trying to overthrow president samuel doe us officials say some 
of the rebels were trained by libya 
thousands of liberians fled the fighting to neighboring ivory 
coast and witnesses described indiscriminate attacks by government 
troops against innocent civilians western diplomats reported 
hundred of liberians were killed 
the united states in an effort to control the government 
troops actions sent two military advisers from the us embassy 
in monrovia to nimba province to monitor the crackdown on the 
rebels the advisers were later withdrawn 
the embassy recommended this week that americans leave the 
country until the situation stabilizes the state department 
said those who must travel to liberia should not leave the capital 
and should register with the us embassy upon their arrival the 
statement said 
us officials estimate there are about 10000 americans in 
liberia most of them missionaries and businessmen the country was 
established in 1847 by former african slaves who left the united 
states 
a us missionary and his british wife were killed several weeks 
ago in nimba where most of the fighting is taking place when 
their car was ambushed as they drove to monrovia 
another american died two weeks ago from a leg wound after being 
shot by liberian troops at a roadblock in monrovia 
the two incidents as well as a suspicious fire at two embassy 
warehouses in monrovia last month raised tensions to one of their 
highest points since doe took power in a bloody coup 10 years ago 
the administration has proposed cuts in aid to liberia from 89 
million this year to 75 million for fiscal 1991 citing human 
rights abuses and corruption

two montana stops on a us 
governmentfunded tour by a group of soviet writers has been 
canceled because some are reputedly antisemitic 
the montana council for international visitors on monday 
canceled the groups scheduled appearances after the host of one 
little big horn college on the crow indian reservation said it 
wouldnt receive the writers 
college president janine peasewindy boy said she hadnt known 
of the reputed antisemitism when she agreed to the eightmember 
groups visit 
she said the college and the community believed that indians as 
minorities themselves could not appear to condone bigotry against 
others 
the writers had been scheduled to visit the college and billings 
on may 69 
council director wendy lewis said the organization doesnt 
screen visitors for their political opinions but she said 
the controversy surrounding some of the writers views had 
destroyed the chance for meaningful dialogue 
lewis added that she was in full agreement with the crow 
indian leader 
peasewindy boy complained that the us information agency 
which is sponsoring the tour told her that the delegation included 
soviet dissidents who were controversial she said she only later 
learned of the reputed antisemitism 
they seemed to think it was inconsequential she said 
the agency has defended the tour as a means of exposing the 
soviet writers to democracy in action 
spokesman frank s johnson jr has said i dont know that 
they are antisemitic i dont know that they are not either 
we feel very strongly that pluralism in this country is worth 
talking about and observing 
johnson said the writers were picked by officials in the us 
embassy in moscow who were seeking to bring conservative russian 
nationalists to the united states 
he did not immediately return a call wednesday seeking comment 
on the montana developments 
the american jewish committee has complained that the tour gives 
known antisemites legitimacy and prestige 
semyon reznick a soviet jewish emigre whose studies were used 
by the committee said some writers in the group exuded the myth 
of a jewishzionist conspiracy an old russian hatred in their 
work 
reznick said that stanislav kunyaev as editor of nash 
sovremenik our contemporary wrote an article praising the 
longdiscredited protocols of the elders of zion as written

solicitor general kenneth starr is reviewing 
the results of an investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of 
a criminal investigation involving rep william h gray iii 
officials said wednesday 
justice department spokesman daniel eramian said attorney 
general dick thornburgh asked starr to review the results of the 
criminal investigation of the news leaks and a separate report by 
the departments office of professional responsiblity 
the investigation supervised by the justice departments 
criminal division concluded that thornburghs spokesman david 
runkel played a role in confirming to cbs reporter rita braver 
that the fbi was investigating alleged financial irregularities in 
grays office 
in a statement last week thornburgh defended runkel saying his 
spokesman was following standing orders not to mislead reporters 
when he did not steer ms braver off a story obtained from other 
sources 
eramian refused to say why thornburgh had asked starr to review 
the issue but acknowledged that the referral came after 
discussions with the chairmen of the house and senate judiciary 
committees 
thornburgh discussed the case friday with the two chairmen rep 
jack brooks dtexas and sen joseph r biden jr ddel eramian 
said 
the report about gray was aired last spring while the 
pennsylvania democrat was running for house majority whip and 
sparked charges from house democrats that leaks about the 
investigation were politically inspired 
outrage from capitol hill prompted the justice department to say 
that gray was not a target of the investigation 
the leak investigation subsequently ordered by thornburgh was 
concluded late last year without any criminal charges being 
brought thornburgh reported to congress that he found no basis for 
disciplining any justice department employees 
under pressure from lawmakers thornburgh earlier this month 
asked the office of professional responsibility to review the 
findings and make recommendations 
the report by michael shaheen head of the departments internal 
watchdog unit concurred with the criminal divisions finding that 
there was no basis for criminal charges according to a source 
shaheen did not recommend any discipinary sanctions said the 
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity

an experimental vertically landing aircraft 
plunked itself down on the capitol grounds wednesday sending 
spectators scurrying up the steps of the capitol with its prop wash 
and setting off praise from members of congress as the greatest 
thing in aviation since jet engines 
some members also denounced plans of the pentagon to stop 
development of a successor plane the v22 osprey after spending 
2 billion 
members of the house public works aviation subcommittee in a 
series of statements at a hearing showed nearly unanimous support 
for the ospreys potential to serve cities with congested airports 
and airways and small towns without conventional airports 
the plane that landed at the capitol actually was a 12yearold 
xv15 predecessor to the v22 made by boeing helicopters and bell 
helicopter textron inc only two xv15s were made pentagon 
contracts call for six ospreys two of which have been delivered 
the xv15 and the v22 are powered by two turboprop engines 
which tilt up so their propellers normally pulling the plane 
forward act like helicopter rotors for takeoff and landing in 
forward flight its 340 mph top speed is significantly faster than 
most helicopters 
only rep john j duncan rtenn raised a negative note 
asking why if the plane has such great potential aircraft 
manufacturers and airlines are not paying to develop it 
supporters said it often is necessary for expensive new aircraft 
to begin as military hardware 
lets give it to the marine corps and let them try to break 
it before its developed for commercial use said rep jim 
lightfoot riowa who said he has piloted a tiltrotor and is sold 
on its potential for civilian use 
the marines sought the osprey for use as an assault transport 
to carry 24 troops or weapons and supplies from ship to beachhead 
in amphibious landings but the defense department argues that 
helicopters already are doing the job and money for the osprey can 
be better used elsewhere when budgets are tight 
rep peter defazio dore brought applause at the hearing when 
he said i can count on less than one hand the the new military 
weapons systems i will support but this is one of them 
welcome to the dawn of a new age in aviation said committee 
chairman rep james oberstar dminn who told the committee it 
took everything but a papal decree to allow the xv15 oneday 
landing rights on the east side of the capitol 
this is the most significant contribution to civilian aviation 
since the dawn of the jet age oberstar told reporters on the 
capitol lawn after making a similar declaration to open the hearing 
in a nearby office building 
joseph del balzo head of systems development for the federal 
aviation administration said the japanese are working on a 
tiltwing aircraft possibly to be built in texas but would likely 
be interested in taking up the tiltrotor technology if the united 
states abandons it 
del balzo told the committee the faa will continue to spend 
about 7 million a year over the next three years to research and 
prepare for tiltrotor aircraft whether us or foreign built 
use of an aircraft similar to the osprey to ferry passengers 
around the busy northeast corridor could increase the number of 
passengers carried by from five million to eight million per year 
del balzo said

polio probably will be stamped out by the end 
of the year in the western hemisphere according to public health 
experts who say health workers are making surprising progress 
against the crippling disease in latin america 
when the pan american health organization in 1985 set 1990 as a 
goal for eradicating polio in the americas we all said this is 
going to be tough that probably is optimistic da 
henderson dean of the johns hopkins school of public health said 
in an interview wednesday 
then suddenly this program began to move and polio has 
vanished at a pace we could not believe said henderson 
president of the association of schools of public health which met 
in washington this week 
at the moment were having a hard time finding the virus at 
all he said crediting efforts that included health workers 
going doortodoor with the vaccine in urban and other high risk 
areas 
last year 22 cases of infection from the virus were reported in 
central and south america with most occurring in areas along the 
western coast of mexico and the andean countries of peru ecuador 
and colombia henderson said 
before the polio vaccine was introduced in 1954 thousands of 
people in the united states were paralyzed by the disease every 
year the last cases of polio in the united sates were reported in 
the late 1970s 
worldwide there were about 250000 cases of polio last year 
the shortened name for poliomyelitis which is caused by a virus in 
contaminated water or food 
the biggest problem areas are in india bangladesh pakistan and 
subsaharan africa henderson said 
the pan american health organization has set the year 2000 as 
the goal for global eradication of polio 
but ridding the world of polio is proving more difficult than 
the campaign that eradicated smallpox in 1977 henderson said 
the polio vaccine must be kept refrigerated until it is 
administered and this has posed a problem in getting supplies of 
the vaccine into areas of developing nations he said 
also surveillance was easier with smallpox since those infected 
with the virus had a rash polio infection is evident when an 
infected person becomes paralyzed but only one in 100 people 
infected with the polio virus become paralyzed in the others the 
infection is silent and immunizes the carrier from further 
infection for life henderson said 
freeing the western hemisphere from the crippling disease will 
be a big step toward the global goal but it will be more 
difficult to eradicate the disease in the eastern hemisphere he 
said

minnesota north dakota and south dakota are 
going to congress and the environmental protection agency for help 
in battling a looming invasion of grasshoppers 
the senate appropriations committee late tuesday added 68 
million to an emergency spending bill to help control the 
infestation expected in the droughtparched region this summer 
the extra money could be used for spraying both crops and land 
set aside for conservation purposes the agriculture department 
budget this year contained just 87 million for control of both 
grasshoppers and mormon crickets primarily on grasslands 
severe grasshopper outbreaks are expected in the three states 
this summer with some areas reporting 1000 or more grasshoppers 
per square yard said sen quentin burdick dnd chairman of the 
agricultural appropriations subcommittee 
just eight grasshoppers per yard can cause economic losses so 
we have a disaster developing burdick said 
in the meantime epa scientists are meeting this week to decide 
whether to approve a emergency request from the three states to let 
farmers use the pesticide asanaxl on grasshopper eggs 
epa ecologists are concerned because seven states altogether are 
seeking exemptions for the pesticide if all of them were approved 
the pesticide would be used 400 times as much as it is now epa 
spokesman al heier said wednesday 
he said he did not know when a final decision would be made 
the pesticide currently is registered on some crops but not on 
small grains or on land enrolled in the conservation reserve 
program 
there is a very large acreage involved here and a high usage 
rate so we have to be careful with risks like this said

the house began debating a gunsforbutter 
democratic alternative to president bushs 1991 budget wednesday as 
a leading democrat gave a cold shoulder to formal talks with the 
white house 
democratic leaders predicted passage of their 124 trillion 
package despite widespread opposition from the republican minority 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo said congressional 
budget work would proceed without waiting for formal 
deficitreduction talks with the administration 
congressional republicans white house officials and some 
democrats have called for such bargaining for months saying its 
the only way to realistically craft a way to shrink the budget 
shortfall 
i dont foresee an official highlevel extraordinary 
summit on the budget gephardt told reporters before debate began 
however gephardt conceded that it would be unrealistic to 
expect congress to do all of this years budget work without some 
kind of input from the administration 
the democratic plan would give the pentagon 8 billion less next 
year than bush wants at the same time it would spend 56 billion 
more than bush on efforts ranging from the fight against aids to 
highway construction 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the budget 
panel said the democratic plans defense cuts would never be 
enacted calling the proposal a dream a letter to santa claus 
democrats said their package spelled out a clear difference 
between their goals and those of bush who they said has responded 
insufficiently to the weakening of the soviet bloc 
the greatest test of our nations leadership in the 90s is 
not military but rather the challenge of competing economically in 
an increasingly complex world economic environment said house 
budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
democratic leaders said they expected to get enough support from 
the houses 40 conservative democrats to pass the measure last 
week conservatives expressed concern that the package was too 
stingy to the military 
the package allocates 2955 billion for defense spending next 
year compared with bushs request for 3038 billion the house 
figure is 115 billion below the amount the military would need to 
stay abreast of inflation 
it claims to reduce the deficit by 36 billion to 638 billion 
just within the 64 billion shortfall target required for next 
year by the grammrudman law fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 
besides the defense cuts it relies on 139 billion in new tax 
receipts the same amount bush wants 
the democratic plan however does not specify which taxes 
should be increased instead in deference to bushs oftrepeated 
opposition to a major tax increase the proposal says no tax 
legislation will move through congress unless and until there 
is a bipartisan agreement with the president of the united states 
on specific legislation to raise taxes 
the democratic budget also calls for a 38 billion slowdown in 
the growth of benefit programs including medicare and 14 
billion in user fees 
in addition it seeks 93 billion in savings proposed 
originally by the administration but derided by congress as 
unrealistic such as 25 billion by improving internal revenue 
service efficiency 
a final house vote on the spending plan was tentatively planned 
for tuesday 
the senate budget committee planned to begin voting on its own 
budget thursday the panel conducted little business when it met 
briefly wednesday

the leader of a successful campaign to block 
senate confirmation of victor stello jr as head of nuclear weapons 
production criticized the administration wednesday for keeping 
stello in the weapons program 
the administration is pulling a fast one on congress and the 
public said stephen schwartz legislative coordinator for 
greenpeace usa which said stellos work as a civilian nuclear 
power regulator was tainted by a lack of commitment to safety 
the energy department announced tuesday exactly nine months 
after stello was nominated to be assistant secretary for defense 
programs that stello had asked president bush to withdraw the 
nomination it said stello would be given a lesser position in the 
weapons program that did not require senate confirmation 
the department released copies of a letter stello sent to bush 
last friday in which he said he was withdrawing because he saw no 
chance of gaining confirmation in the foreseeable future 
greenpeace said stello who started working for the department 
last summer after taking temporary leave from the nuclear 
regulatory commission should not be allowed to continue working on 
the nuclear weapons program 
department spokesman tom olson said stellos responsibilities 
would include overseeing the restart of nuclear material production 
at the savannah river reactors in south carolina 
retaining stello to manage these critical tasks sends a 
message that despite all the fine rhetoric the fundamental 
priorities of the doe have not changed schwartz said 
in a joint statement sen samm nunn dga chairman of the 
armed services committee and sen john warner rva ranking 
republican on the panel said bush had formally withdrawn the 
nomination and that the matter was closed 
energy secretary james d watkins who urged the committee to 
confirm stello last fall has made no public comment on the 
withdrawal

opponents of the seabrook nh nuclear power 
plant appealed to the nations top judge wednesday to interrupt 
startup of the plant pending court appeals 
in a petition to supreme court chief justice william rehnquist 
the opponents repeated arguments about the safety of the plant and 
the alleged inadequacy of evacuation plans 
but those arguments have failed to persuade the nuclear 
regulatory commission and the us court of appeals a full federal 
appeal is scheduled for sept 18 but by that time opponents 
argue seabrook will already be operating at full power 
the petition filed by massachusetts attorney general james 
shannon the seacoast antipollution league and the new england 
coalition on nuclear pollution seeks an immediate stay on the 
seabrook license granted march 1 by the nrc 
the filing said a radioactive plume from the plant could reach 
inhabited beach areas in as little as one hour whereas it would 
take six hours to 10 hours to evacuate the some 250000 tourists 
and seasonal residents who flock into the seabrook emergency zone 
during the summer months 
rehnquist issued no immediate response to the petition 
seabrook spokesman ron sher said we received the license from 
the nrc because we earned that license seabrook station is a safe 
plant 
the seabrook reactor is operating at about 8 percent power 
full power operation is expected by early summer

another 200000 people will be resettled from 
areas irradiated in the chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in 
a 26 billion program adopted by the soviet legislature on 
wednesday the eve of the fourth anniversary of the disaster 
many members of the legislature the supreme soviet criticized 
the plan as inadequate to deal with the health agricultural 
economic and environmental aftermath of the ukraine accident 
legislator yuri scherback estimated 250 billion rubles 405 
billion are needed over the next 10 years 
official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four 
reactors at chernobyl caught fire and exploded april 26 1986 
unofficial reports say 250 died the blast spewed cesium strontium 
and plutonium across much of the ukraine byelorussia and russia 
and sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world 
after a day of debate including charges of an official coverup 
of the disaster and bungled evacuations the supreme soviet 
endorsed a program drafted by the three affected republics and the 
central government for dealing with chernobyl from 199092 tass 
news agency reported about 180000 to 200000 people still living 
in contaminated areas will be resettled 
about 116000 people were evacuated in the months after the 
accident and some soviet scientists and politicians have been 
campaigning since then for further resettlements they say 4 
million soviets are living on contaminated land 
wednesdays resolution also provides for stepping up medical aid 
to residents of the contaminated zone and stabilizing radiation 
levels 
many residents have complained of inadequate medical care cases 
of anemia leukemia and cancers have been reported rising among 
people living on irradiated land many residents still eat 
irradiated food because alternatives are not available 
after years of passivity the people suffering have been staging 
demonstrations this week further protests are planned thursday 
the fourth anniversary in byelorussia and the ukraine 
a 24hour world telethon for chernobyl victims began in moscow 
wednesday night and had raised 48 million in the first few hours 
tass reported cnn showed live scenes of the telethon to us 
viewers many of the donations came from the united states japan 
and western europe tass said 
protesters demand trials for the officials who concealed the 
extent of the danger and delayed evacuating contaminated areas 
better medical care for victims and the import of radiationfree 
food 
dealing with the larger questions posed by chernobyl the 
supreme soviet directed the government to draft a bill on the use 
of nuclear energy and nuclear safety and to phase out the 
chernobyl power plant the plants three remaining reactors are 
still operating the ukrainian legislature wants the plant closed 
by 1995 
several other nuclear power projects around the country were 
canceled because of heightened safety concerns generated by 
chernobyl 
scherbak from the ukraine told a news conference wednesday a 
parliamentary commission should be set up to examine 
decisionmaking in the chernobyl disaster and to determine which 
high government officials were responsible for slow reaction to it 
and the coverup 
fellow legislator yuri voronezhtsev from byelorussia told 
reporters the commission is needed to single out officials still 
standing in the way of a full accounting and cleanup 
the main thing is not to bring criminal charges against people 
but there are people who have not acknowledged their mistakes 
who are braking things today he said

the bush administration on wednesday asked 
congress to strengthen the food and drug administrations authority 
to act against companies that abuse or defraud the agency 
the legislation was submitted in response to the generic drug 
scandal in which drug manufacturers were found to have 
misrepresented their products and bribed fda officials to win 
approval to market their drugs 
we must have the legal tools to move quickly and decisively 
against anyone who seeks to mislead or subvert the fda said 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
the measure would authorize the fda to debar anyone the agency 
considered a threat to the integrity of the agencys product review 
process and to refuse to review or approve any products submitted 
by a debarred company 
also the fda would be able to withdraw improperly approved 
products and could suspend for two years approvals of other 
products granted to a debarred company during the period when 
illegal activity occurred 
the fda also could impose fines in cases of bribery fraud or 
other illegal acts committed during an fda productapproval 
process under the legislation 
under current law the fda can only ask a drug manufacturer to 
remove a product from the market unless the product is a threat to 
public health otherwise the agency must go through the courts to 
remove a product if a company refuses a request for a recall 
rep john dingell dmich and the chairman of the house energy 
and commerce subcommittee that uncovered much of the evidence of 
fraud and abuse in the generic drug scandal said the legislation 
is well intentioned but were going to continue working on our 
own 
one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the 
administrations proposal presents practical difficulties in 
winning passage this year because it is so sweeping affecting 
anyone whose product requires fda approval

jurors tried to report they were 
deadlocked wednesday at the bank fraud trial of us rep harold 
ford but a federal judge told them to keep deliberating 
it is far too early for you to report that you are hopelessly 
deadlocked us district judge odell horton said 
after seven hours of deliberations over two days jury foreman 
ho robinson told horton that the jury was deadlocked horton 
stopped him from continuing and held a conference at his bench with 
prosecutors and defense lawyers 
the judge then told the jury to return thursday and resume its 
deliberations 
ford is accused of taking payoffs disguised as bank loans from 
banking brothers jake and ch butcher jr also standing trial are 
former butcher accountant david crabtree and lawyers karl 
schledwitz and douglas beaty 
the memphis democrat first elected in 1974 is charged with 
conspiracy and fraud ford the states only black congressman has 
complained that he is the victim of racist prosecutors an 
allegation the government has denied 
after the jury was dismissed ford met with his attorneys in a 
small room off the court emerging later and professing his 
confidence as he pushed through a crowd of reporters 
we still anticipate a unanimous vote for acquittal ford 
said 
earlier wednesday the jury asked for transcripts notebooks and 
a blackboard but horton refused the transcripts which would be 
voluminous and could take as long as 30 days to provide the other 
items were provided 
the jury began deliberating tuesday after hearing 2 months of 
testimony and arguments jurors asked for and received all 170 
exhibits from the trial including bank documents tax returns and 
records of fords personal finances 
prosecutors called 29 witnesses and outlined a complicated 
series of butcher loans to ford from 1976 to 1982 the defense 
called no witnesses and ford said he decided not to testify 
because he regarded the governments case as weak 
the government says ford drew more than 1 million in butcher 
loans bouncing them from bank to bank with few if any payments 
made until the butcher banking empire collapsed in 1983

two prominent eye doctors confirmed wednesday 
that president bush has a mild form of glaucoma but said he can 
discontiue using prescription eye drops 
extensive testing of the eye including detailed photographs 
once again revealed no abnormalities and no visual loss said dr 
burton lee the white house physician it was decided to stop the 
betagan eye drops and follow him closely for now on no treatment 
other physicians earlier prescribed the drops every 12 hours and 
said bush would have to use them for the rest of his life 
stephen hart deputy white house press secretary said the 
decision to take the bush off the medication was simply a 
difference of opinion with the other doctors 
there is no progression or regression in the glaucoma hart 
said there is no change in his eyes 
bush flew by helicopter to bethesda naval hospital in nearby 
suburban maryland for the checkup by dr richard brubaker of the 
mayo clinic in rochester minn and dr harry quigley of johns 
hopkins hospital in baltimore 
both physicians are experts on glaucoma 
the president spent about an hour in the hospital wearing dark 
glasses as he left he flashed a thumbsup sign to reporters as he 
was driven past in his limousine 
during bushs annual checkup april 12 physicians found the 
president has an early stage of glaucoma if untreated glaucoma 
can lead to a gradual impairment of sight that can result in 
blindness 
lee said earlier wednesday that there are no problems with the 
presidents vision his vision remains excellent but i feel that 
it is prudent to have outside experts assess the treatment

while most of nicaragua celebrated 
wednesdays inauguration of violeta barrios de chamorro as the dawn 
of a new era this sandinista bastion lamented the demise of the 
leftist revolution it embraced 
the closest thing to inauguration festivity on estelis sunny 
streets was gustavo altamirano lanuzas tying a pole carrying the 
blueandwhite national flag to one of the bars protecting his 
front window 
it would not be prudent to celebrate here said the 
62yearold farmer and rancher who now administers his sons 
wholesale rice business 
the night after a 14party united national opposition coalition 
drubbed the sandinistas in feb 25 elections a mob of disgruntled 
leftists stormed the campaign headquarters of the victorious 
alliance 
the onestory building its facade painted the blueandwhite 
party colors stands along the corner from altamiranos home 
shattered desks overturned benches and the charred remains of 
shelves and documents litter the floor 
sob dogs is scrawled in red paint across the facade 
esteli 60 miles north of managua with a population of about 
120000 was the only goodsized city carried by the sandinistas 
but only by 200 ballots out of 40000 cast 
evidence of unvanquished leftist fervor greets a visitor at 
almost every turn 
many of the pastelpainted buildings are still pocked by 
bulletholes from fierce combat during the revolutionary war part 
of downtown was demolished by bombs and rockets delivered by 
dictator anastasio somozas warplanes in 1979 
some walls are patched not a few display colorful murals of 
militant men and women brandishing arms sandinista doctors 
administering vaccines young militants teaching peasants to read 
and other gains of what began in 1979 as a social experiment hailed 
throughout the hemisphere 
a block from uno headquarters in the staterun 
telecommunications corporation office is the gallery of heroes 
and martyrs 
the photographs of 18 telephone company workers young men and 
women killed in the revolution or the war against the usfunded 
contras look down from a wall decorated with plastic flowers and 
strings of christmas tree lights 
the largest portrait is a classic view of argentineborn cuban 
revolutionary ernesto che guevara in his beret 
along the corner several longfaced young men sat on a stoop 
across from the firehouse they were all sandinistas and though in 
civilian clothes all wore army boots 
one had a 9mm sovietmade automatic pistol stuck in his belt 
were determined to defend the achievements of the revolution 
but by civic means said 25yearold construction worker oscar 
blandon 
he said sandinista opposition to mrs chamorros administration 
would be marked by temperance and moderation 
two women passed by wearing yellow sandinista campaign tshirts 
bearing the obsolete slogan ganamos we win 
maybe because we in this city suffered more than anyone weve 
been the ones to more completely understand what the revolution 
meant said rafael chavarria an accountant waiting for a bus at 
the central plaza 
chavarria the son of peasant farmers identified with the 
sandinistas but is not a party member 
its clear that since the revolution more poor people have 
been able to overcome their circumstances and make for themselves a 
better life than their parents lives he said 
now our role must be one of constructive criticism to call 
the new governments attention to what goes wrong but always by 
civic means 
altamirano a supporter of uno who lost land and cattle 
confiscated by the sandinistas said it would have been nice to 
have some sort of public celebration of the transfer of power 
after all that would be nothing more than the exercise of a 
democratic right he said but the important thing is not the 
celebration or whether we won or lost in esteli 
what is important is that this is an historic change from a 
totalitarian to a democratic system

complained wednesday that americans have been overcautious about 
investing in his country despite its offer to allow foreigners to 
own all the stock in new companies they organize

three vicepresidents of the council of national unity the council 
has been acting as a parliament pending an election may 20 to

forever he said 
the south korean gold star group has made definite offers of 
business projects and there has been some interest from france and 
west germany manzatu said

last fall 80 percent had no sympathy with the party he said he 
had been a member until he was expelled in 1982 but had only 
joined because he was threatened that his daughters would not get

oskar lafontaine the victim of a 
wednesday assassination attempt is one of west germanys most 
colorful politicians and was picked to lead his opposition party in 
decembers national elections 
lafontaine has a reputation for making bold and brash statements 
and seems to enjoy his role as a gadfly politician 
he consistently argues against the largescale nato troop 
presence in west germany and has long been a critic of west 
germanys policy of giving open access to east germans 
he has also predicted that in the future west germans could have 
a standard work week of as little as 20 hours 
wednesday night lafontaine was stabbed in the neck by a woman 
who presented him with an album of poetry and a bouquet of flowers 
there was no known motive for the attack 
the stabbing severed an artery and lafontaine was reportedly in 
serious condition in a cologne hospital 
lafontaine was at the forefront of politicians who argued that 
despite west germanys wealth the nation could not afford to 
absorb the influx of the more than a halfmillion east germans who 
have flooded into west germany since last fall 
lafontaine unlike many other west german politicans played 
only a cameo role in the hectic campaigning before east germanys 
free democratic elections on march 18 
his social democratic party advocates gradual german 
reunification and this is believed to have contributed to the 
relatively poor showing of its east german sister party 
the east german social democratic party finished second in the 
balloting far behind a conservative coalition that closely follows 
west german chancellor helmut kohls push for quick reunification 
but a recent poll of east german voters by the west german bild 
am sonntag newspaper this month said 46 percent of those questioned 
would back lafontaine as chancellor of a united germany only 24 
percent opted for kohl 
there has been speculation lafontaine could unseat kohl in the 
dec 2 national elections 
lafontaine is governor of the tiny saarland state that borders 
france and luxembourg it is one of the poorest regions in west 
germany 
the divorced lafontaine is known to have an active social life 
which has featured prominently in west germanys tabloid press

lithuanias president on wednesday accused the 
white house of succumbing to kremlin blackmail by failing to 
impose sanctions against the soviet union in response to moscows 
economic blockade of the breakaway republic 
the logic in this is hard to understand but blackmail does 
not require logic the lithuanian leader vytautas landsbergis 
told lawmakers his remarks were released by the parliamentary 
press office 
lithuanian leaders have expressed frustration with the failure 
of the united states and other western nations to come to the 
republics aid it has been locked in a standoff with moscow since 
president mikhail gorbachev rejected its march 11 declaration of 
independence 
the united states has never recognized the soviet annexation of 
lithuania and the neighboring baltic states estonia and latvia in 
1940 however it has refrained from any strong criticism of 
gorbachevs handling of the matter 
president bush has called for dialogue to resolve the dispute 
in washington bush responded wednesday to critical remarks by 
landsbergis a day earlier i dont need any defense he said 
the us public supported his stance 
the kremlin cut off oil supplies to lithuania on april 18 and 
then curtailed shipments of natural gas and other raw materials to 
try to pressure the lithuanians into rescinding their declaration 
of independence 
yevgeny primakov a member of gorbachevs advisory board hinted 
wednesday that some soviet officials had sought stronger action 
against lithuania 
president gorbachev frankly speaking has had to restrain 
many people primakov a member of the presidential council told 
the official news agency tass 
it was not clear whether he meant the soviet military which has 
already used force to round up lithuanian army deserters and occupy 
a printing plant 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said the republic 
is trying to get around the kremlins cutoff of supplies by setting 
up direct trade links with soviet regions and factories according 
to spokesman paul pauparus 
lithuania produces more meat and milk than it consumes and 
pauparus said sympathetic officials in moscow leningrad and 
elsewhere might be willing to barter those supplies for fuel and 
other necessities 
however the shipments would have to travel by 
kremlincontrolled train and truck routes 
conditions in lithuania meanwhile were said to be worsening 
lithuanias economy is on the brink of collapse the soviet 
newspaper selskaya zhizn reported wednesday 
lithuanian deputy prime minister algirdas brazauskas estimated 
wednesday the republics oil reserves would last until may 20 the 
soviet union is lithuanias sole supplier of fuel 
brazauskas also said shortages of grain sugar salt and 
margarine had developed according to eduardas potashinskas a 
lithuanian activist who monitored the parliament session 
potashinskas said speakers at the parliament also said the 
kremlin had cut off soviet supplies of paper and wood products to 
lithuania 
brazauskas suggested if the blockade continued lithuania should 
reexamine its policy of continuing to supply food products to 
soviet buyers according to existing contracts it has already 
ceased supplying cement to the soviet union he said 
in moscow soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov spoke informally 
wednesday with a group of lithuanian parliamentarians and 
journalists he repeated previous soviet demands that lithuania 
would have to repeal its independence declaration before the 
kremlin would lift its blockade journalists reported 
the talk took place in the lobby of the supreme soviet chambers 
during a break in the legislative session

the prison sentence of former ptl 
official richard dortch was reduced to 2 years wednesday by a 
judge who said he must do jail time despite testimony that sent 
ministry founder jim bakker to prison 
us district judge robert potter did not follow the suggestion 
of dortchs attorneys that he be placed on probation the judge 
said dortch likely would serve from 24 to 29 months taking into 
account time for good behavior 
dortch had been sentenced to eight years which meant he would 
have spent from 40 to 52 months in prison potter said dortch is 
currently serving his term in the federal prison at eglin air force 
base in florida 
dortch bakkers former top lieutenant at the 
multimilliondollar ptl television ministry also was fined 
200000 after pleading guilty to fraud and conspiracy potter did 
not reduce the fine wednesday 
the judge wrote that the sentence reduction means dortch will 
receive due consideration for his cooperation with the government 
but simultaneously also will be required to serve a meaningful 
period of incarceration 
defendant dortchs actions are in sharp contrast with the 
actions of his codefendant bakker who has refused to bring 
himself to understand that he has committed the violations charged 
in the indictments for which he was convicted potter wrote 
im not disappointed said one of dortchs attorneys mark 
calloway it was a fair and realistic reduction in the sentence 
dortch and bakker were indicted in december 1988 on 24 counts of 
fraud and conspiracy for soliciting 158 million from ptl 
supporters in exchange for bogus guarantees of free lodging at the 
ministrys retreat in nearby fort mill sc 
in august dortch entered into a plea agreement that called for 
him to cooperate with the government including testifying against 
his former boss and other indicted ptl officials 
dortch testified at length at bakkers trial which began aug 
28 bakker was convicted in october on all 24 counts he was 
sentenced by potter to 45 years in prison and fined 500000 
bakker 50 is serving his sentence at a mediumsecurity federal 
prison in minnesota 
dortch also testifed earlier this month at the perjury trial of 
former ptl pastor sam johnson potter threw the charges out saying 
the governments case was weak 
on april 12 dortch cried as he asked potter to show mercy and 
reduce his prison time assistant us attorney jerry miller told 
the judge that dortch made an honest and sincere effort to be 
truthful and straightforward 
dortchs attorneys asked potter to place their client on 
probation they said he has medical problems and has been spending 
his days in prison handing out clothing 
calloway said he spoke by phone wednesday morning with dortch 
who asked that the attorney not describe his reaction to the 
judges order 
he simply wants to serve his sentence as quietly as possible 
and get on with his life the attorney said

labor party leader shimon peres said wednesday 
he failed in his attempts to form israels next government 
peres had been trying to put together a new governing coalition 
since his centerleft party engineered the collapse of a 
laborlikud government on march 15 
peres decision to abandon his attempts came after a key 
prospective defector from prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc said he would stay with likud in spite of 
labors efforts to lure him into a coalition 
i have decided to go to a likudheaded coalition economics 
minister yitzhak modai announced in a nationally broadcast israel 
television interview 
modai blamed labors negotiating team which he said torpedoed 
his agreement with peres and other party leaders 
his statement ended two days of intensive negotiations with both 
peres and shamir and brought israels two major parties back to 
square one of their political deadlock each controls 60 seats in 
the 120member parliament 
shamirs 15month cabinet fell last month over likuds refusal 
to accept a us formula for arranging israelipalestinian peace 
talks 
peres had a thursday midnight deadline for presenting a 
government he told reporters he will give back his mandate to 
president chaim herzog 
herzog may then hold another round of negotiations with israels 
political parties or immediately give shamir the task of fashioning 
a coalition 
peres said he doubts that shamir would be able to form a 
government and if he succeeds it would be an unsuccessful 
government we talk about an extremist rightwing government the 
like of which israel never had 
likud officials said they were encouraged by modais decision 
mr peres has no possibility of forming a government i hope 
we are now beginning to get out of the political crisis and i hope 
that yitzhak shamir would form and head a government cabinet 
minister ehud olmert said 
shamir seemed less certain acknowledging in an israel radio 
interview that in a political crisis everything is possible 
israel television said another political turnabout is possible 
even tomorrow before peres heads for herzogs residence 
labors ruling bureau also meets thursday and peres old party 
rival defense minister yitzhak rabin is expected to attack peres 
failure in coalition negotiations 
israeli media reports said rabin might demand a new coalition 
with likud and even seek party leadership likud leaders have ruled 
out an alliance with a peresled labor but did not reject a union 
with rabin a labor hawk

hurled bricks and firebombs at the indonesian embassy dutch 
television reported 
the report said 10 protesters were arrested and 28 police 
officers injured in the clash which came on the 40th anniversary

the moluccas archipelago west of new guinea was incorporated by 
indonesia in 1950 when the netherlands colonial rule over the 
former dutch east indies came to an end

peaceful demonstration by 1500 people and broke through a police 
cordon around the embassy the television report said police had 
said earlier wednesday only several dozen demonstrators were 
involved in clashes

gov joe frank harris defended state mental 
health officials wednesday in the case of a man who was released 
from a state mental hospital the day before he opened fire in a 
suburban shopping mall 
one person was killed and four were wounded in tuesdays attack 
james calvin brady 31 had been released from georgia regional 
hospital a state psychiatric facility in atlanta on monday said 
james ledbetter commissioner of the department of human resources 
psychiatrists had judged that he was not harmful to himself or 
others ledbetter said after reviewing records in the case 
it looked to me like all the procedures rules and regulations 
were followed and the clinical decision was made to release him 
ledbetter said 
its a very difficult decision to predict future behavior and 
thats essentially what our staff is called on to do we are 
not perfect he said 
harris and ledbetter said bradys release was not due to 
overcrowding 
the governor said the state is sincere in trying to do 
everything that we can to prevent something like this from 
happening in this case i think it was being done 
the gunman smiling and wearing a gray suit fired a handgun 
into a lunchtime crowd at perimeter mall after throwing his gun 
into a trash can brady surrendered just outside the malls main 
entrance police said 
dekalb county police said the gunman carried documents from the 
hospital in atlanta indicating he had been diagnosed as having 
homicidal tendencies 
a dekalb county judge wednesday ordered the mental hospital to 
turn over bradys records to police ledbetter said the department 
of human resources was seeking judicial guidance on what exactly 
can be disclosed without intruding on doctorpatient privilege 
police said brady was taken late tuesday to central state 
hospital at milledgeville another staterun mental facility 
officers said brady bought the revolver and 12 rounds of 
hollowpoint ammunition a type designed to expand on impact and 
cause particularly severe wounds for 139 monday at avondale pawn 
shop in an eastern atlanta suburb 
detective lt rodney maddox described the gun as a cutdown 
barrel version of a largeframe revolver and said it looked 
pretty worn 
how did he get the gun why did he get the gun maddox said 
we dont have a good answer to that and may never know why 
georgia law does not restrict the sale of handguns or rifles but 
requires a license for anyone who carries a concealed weapon such 
a license cannot be obtained within five years of release from a 
psychiatric hospital 
harris said wednesday the shooting spree makes a very strong 
statement for stronger gun laws in georgia but he acknowledged 
that public sentiment has just not risen in support enough to 
pass something of that nature 
rambling disjointed notes found in the apartment brady had been 
living in said he had taken crack cocaine and then met two people 
in california who created a machine that would control his mind 
if i got the public at large outcry and attention of why i 
became insane the public would bring these two people to 
accounting said the notes 
brady was a native of anniston ala his relatives in alabama 
expressed shock over the incident his stepmother sadie bolton 
said brady seemed fine when she last saw him around thanksgiving 
bradys halfbrother told the times of contra costa county 
calif that brady had a drug problem and was talking crazy 
before he left the san francisco area two months ago 
he was talking stupid said the halfbrother who asked that 
his name not be used he said that there were some people who 
were controlling this box in his stomach 
one of the wounded people remained in critical condition 
wednesday at shallowford hospital and one was in stable condition 
a third was treated and released and the fourth was expected to be 
released after treatment for leg wounds

the longest prison siege in british 
history ended wednesday when the last five inmates at strangeways 
prison abandoned their rooftop stronghold 
the five prisoners gingerly walked down the slippery slate roof 
and stepped into a hydraulic lift that carried them the 150 feet 
down to the prison courtyard where they were taken into custody 
the surrender was shown live on the british broadcasting corps 
main evening newscast 
prisoners had taken over the grim overcrowded victorian prison 
in a riot that began april 1 during sunday chapel services about 
300 prisoners overwhelmed guards took the jail keys and released 
the rest of the inmates 
running battles raged in the prison in northern england for 
about four days and prompted unrest and violence in jails 
throughout the country 
in the weeks of negotiations that followed inmates complained 
about conditions in the prison where they had been held three or 
four to a tiny cell allowed a shower and change of clothes once a 
week and provided with a bucket instead of a toilet 
during the siege inmates built and rebuilt barricades and 
planted booby traps to keep out authorities but nearly all of the 
1650 prisoners had surrendered by the time more than 100 officers 
in riot gear moved in wednesday morning 
the final five holdouts were trapped on the roof and a sixth 
inmate was captured in the sweep 
home office spokesman mike gander said prison guards were going 
through the scorched and wrecked jail to search for bodies 
we are confident there are no bodies to be found gander 
said 
one prisoner died as a result of injuries in the riot and one 
prison officer died in the hospital during the riot because of an 
existing heart condition another was slightly injured when the 
facility was being retaken wednesday 
home office minister david mellor on wednesday rejected 
criticism of the authorities strategy of drawnout negotiations 
with the inmates 
would you prefer that wed knocked them off the roof and 
people would have seen them falling head first down five stories 
mellor said in a television interview 
the riots apparent ringleader paul taylor 29 serving a 
threeyear sentence for burglary was the last to board the crane 
fists clenched in the air 
if i could get my hands on him id give hm a damned good 
hiding taylors grandmother helen smythe told reporters at her 
home near liverpool hes been an absolute disgrace they should 
have thrown him off the roof

the st louis sun which hoped to be the first 
major metropolitan newspaper to make a successful launch in this 
country since world war ii unexpectedly folded wednesday after 
only seven months 
at a news conference ralph ingersoll ii editor in chief of the 
new newspaper said the st louis sun had published its last 
edition tuesday night 
closing the sun was a decision the st louis marketplace made 
for us said ingersoll since launching the paper sept 25 1989 
the newspaper had published 213 editions 
it is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation 
to make this enterprise viable and so we have concluded that there 
is no longer room in st louis for a third newspaper in addition to 
our own suburban journals and the postdispatch 
the sun struggled to overcome higherthanexpected costs 
revolvingdoor circulation limited advertising and a murky image 
the newspaper also had troubles developing everyday readers 
on april 1 the newspaper had a circulation of 109000 up from 
a low of 80000 during the winter aided by the start of a new 
bingo promotion ingersoll had guaranteed advertisers 
circulation of 105000 for the first six months of 1990 
the sun also was criticized by some as sensationalizing stories 
for its coverage of a politician involved in a sexual assault and 
of the fiveyear anniversary of an accident in which a man was 
nearly sawed in two 
the newspaper was further chided for running photos of new 
womens swimsuits and lingerie 
but the sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build 
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing st louis 
major air carrier trans world airlines 
some critics derided the suns flood of promotions fluorescent 
green billboards and contests but sun executives defended those 
practices as the best way to encourage people to give their paper a 
try 
in making the surprise announcement ingersoll was flanked by 
postersize blowups of various pages of the sun also on hand were 
publisher tom tallarico who left the postdispatch to join the 
sun and robert jelenic president of ingersoll publications co 
lorraine orlandi a reporter who joined the paper when it was 
launched said the 4 pm announcement came as a shock and some 
employees cried but within about two hours staff members had 
brought cases of beer into the newsroom 
we were putting out a newspaper today i had just returned 
from city hall with a couple of stories to write ms orlandi 
said 
the people here are not gloomy people are in shock she 
said there were no visible signs that we were shutting down or 
even cutting back there were renovations going on 
in an interview earlier this month ingersoll said the two main 
problems facing the sun were higherthanexpected circulation costs 
and a whopping turnover rate among home subscribers 
ingersoll said at the time the company had been forced to spend 
5 million more than planned to distribute the newspaper because 
twice as many readers as expected wanted their newspapers delivered 
advertisers consider that to be very good but its much more 
expensive than we planned for ingersoll said 
but home subscribers also were cancelling their subscriptions at 
an extremely fast rate making it difficult for the sun to sign up 
enough new subscribers to keep circulation from falling

dexter gordon walked out on the stage at avery 
fisher hall a tall man with a devilish smile whose body bent with 
a sickly gait 
he plugged his horn between his lips and blew reedy dreams 
and when he was done he accepted the applause but not alone 
when dexter bowed he always stepped back and gave the stage to his 
star his tenor saxophone he had a way of presenting it to the 
audience like a sacred offering to a very special priesthood 
dexter keith gordon had come home 14 years after he left the 
prejudices and restrictions of his homeland for europe 
a man of musical genius and personal humility he died wednesday 
at the age of 67 of kidney failure 
like bb king and his sweet lucille gordons saxophone was 
always his muchappreciated costar with it he helped define and 
refine an important musical legacy bebop 
as the last of this centurys great saxophone geniuses lester 
young charlie parker john coltrane gordon had a reputation as a 
strikingly original jazz soloist the style he developed had a 
strong influence on younger saxophonists of the 60s and 70s and 
is influential even today 
but as important as he was to jazz he never placed himself 
before the music the bebop he championed may have been brash but 
gordon wasnt he embraced humility 
one of my greatest compliments came in 1982 when he said i was 
his favorite guitarist said kenny burrell 
he was an amazing personality he was a good person said 
drummer art blakey who had played with gordon back in the 40s 
with billy eckstines band id see him and id say come on up 
here and stand by my big cymbal dont just be a silent movie 
star 
there was nothing silent about his horn what he spun out was 
the stuff of which dreams were made and gordon was a dream 
merchant of sorts 
listen to the breathy sax pulls on the moody ballad who can 
you turn to or the sensual underpinnings and samba chases of 
manha de carnaval fingerpop and toetap to the cool 
smoothness of coppin the haven enjoy the lively cool of 
tanya 
he was something else he had a style of his own blakey 
said 
gordon came along at a time when the icon of the tenor sax was 
lester young whose lyrical style was the starting point for 
upandcoming horn players including charlie parker but gordon 
carved a new approach for the tenor sax and influenced many of 
youngs proteges john coltrane stan getz sonny stitt 
gordon assimilated parkers musical inventions and added his own 
furious harmonics and multitextured tones sonny rollins and 
coltrane used gordons style as a base and created their own years 
later gordon updated his own sound by learning from them 
dexter gordon was one of the pioneers of the modern 
saxophone burrell said his distinct and very personal style 
plus his strong knowledge of music caused him to be both an 
influential figure among saxophonists and an inspiration to many 
other musicians 
gordon at an early age went to jazz concerts with his father 
who was duke ellington and lionel hamptons doctor when he was 13 
he became to study music theory and clarinet at 15 he switched to 
alto sax studying with lloyd reese who had taught the 
bassistcomposerpianist charles mingus two years later gordon 
was performing in night clubs on tenor sax 
he traveled a rough and craggy road there was booze lots of 
it there were too many drugs there was jail 
but the anguish with which he lived in no way diminished the 
sweetness that came from his saxophone nor did it intrude upon his 
unblinking love of jazz 
when he was nominated for an academy award in 1987 as best actor 
for his portrayal of a tragic jazz musician in bertrand taverniers 
round midnight gordon responded to the news like a high school 
jock whod been made quarterback he had been watching the 
today show with his wife maxine and his stepson while on 
vacation in cuernavaca mexico 
there were giggles and oneword punctuations wow yeah awright 
the film was dedicated to bud powell and i broadened that 
concept to include ben webster coleman hawkins and people like 
that who were expatriates including myself he said at the time 
in an interview with the associated press 
thats why i broadened the character as much as i could to 
touch as many people as possible i wanted to open up my world to 
them and make them aware of all the giants and unsung heros of the 
past they werent aware of

the mother of aids victim ryan white said 
wednesday that every family risks losing a member to the fatal 
disease because sex is a fact of life 
it can be your brother your sister your mother your 
father jeanne white 42 said in an interview on capitol hill 
it could be a loved one a friend 
mrs white of cicero ind said the disease is inevitable 
because among the ways it is spread is through sexual contact her 
son a hemophiliac died april 8 after contracting the disease 
through infected blood five years ago at the age of 13 
ryans funeral two weeks ago drew 1500 friends and admirers 
including celebrity musicians michael jackson and elton john 
ryan was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 
december 1984 his court battle to be allowed to stay in public 
school called attention to the plight of all aids sufferers 
mrs white spent the day wednesday lobbying senators for passage 
of a bill that would provide 600 million to help fight aids the 
senate labor and human resources committee voted 160 to approve 
the legislation on april 4 and dedicated it to ryan 
mrs white met with the two main sponsors of the bill sens 
edward m kennedy dmass and orrin hatch rutah as well as 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine she also met with other 
senators trying to get them to add their names to the bill and 
planned further meetings thursday 
i think they felt like they can relate she said 
especially if you have kids 
but mrs white said she wants the bill passed for everyone who 
has aids not just children 
i am in contact with a lot of gay men who have the disease a 
lot of mothers who maybe are hiv positive from their hemophiliac 
husbands some have lost their husbands even and the wife is hiv 
positive i just keep in constant communication with all types of 
people 
the disease is passed through sexual contact through 
contaminated blood and hypodermic needles and from a mother to a 
child while it is still in the womb 
i think aids is here to stay she said i think that 
because we would all have to quit having sex completely i think 
thats the main issue somebody is going to be giving it to 
someobdy through sex and if we dont have sex we dont have 
children i just feel this is a subject that people dont like to 
talk about it is spread that way 
she said ryan harbored no ill feelings and all he cared about 
was finding a cure but she did say progress toward fighting the 
disease would have been quicker had president reagan and his wife 
met ryan sooner 
ryan met ronald and nancy reagan a week before he died she 
said and i felt like ryan made a very emotional impact on them 
and i think had they maybe met him four years ago or three 
years ago i think they would have related more to the issue of 
aids

a former member of a religious cult 
tearfully admitted wednesday that he switched on a chain saw to 
mask the sounds of a family of five being bound and shot 
gregory s winship 29 made the admission during a plea bargain 
hearing in which he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
including turning over notes he kept of cult activities 
winship had faced a trial set for monday on five counts of 
complicity to aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping 
under the deal if he is a cooperative witness in upcoming 
trials of other cult members including leader jeffrey lundgren he 
will be sentenced on guilty pleas he will enter to five counts of 
complicity to murder 
all 13 members of the cult have been indicted for either killing 
or complicity in killing the family 
winship of independence mo was freed on a 150000 surety 
bond he had been held in lake county jail since he was extradited 
from kansas city in february 
lake county prosecutor steven c latourette said winship was a 
lundgren follower from 1986 through at least april 18 1989 when 
the cult fled the county 
i think its fair to say he took extensive notes during the 
course of the classes that were conducted by the group 
latourette said its more a collection of loose leaf pages that 
contain what was talked about who was present the scriptures that 
were used during each class 
investigators in january acting on a tip found the bodies of 
dennis avery 49 his wife cheryl 42 and their daughters trina 
15 rebecca 13 and karen 7 buried in a barn in kirtland about 
30 miles east of cleveland 
all five had been bound with duct tape and shot 
the barn is on a farm once rented by lundgren a defrocked lay 
minister for the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day 
saints authorities say lundgren was a domineering fundamentalist 
leader of a cult that lived as a commune on the farm 
lundgren who faces trial july 9 is charged with five counts of 
aggravated murder five counts of kidnapping and one count of 
complicity to attempted aggravated murder the last charge stems 
from an alleged plan to kill worshippers of his former church 
lake county common pleas judge paul h mitrovich asked winship 
to explain his role the day the avery family died 
in a nearwhisper winship replied i assisted mr lundgren 
who was in the barn by doing whatever he told me to do namely 
that being operating a chain saw just outside the barn to muffle 
noise 
and what was done by mr lundgren at the time while you were 
operating the chain saw mitrovich asked 
the murder of dennis avery was committed sir winship said 
he made similar statements for each of four other counts of 
complicity to murder each pertaining to another avery family 
member 
latourette said complicity to murder carries a possible sentence 
of 15 years to life in prison complicity to aggravated murder 
carries 20 years to life 
codefendant richard brand also 26 and also of independence 
pleaded guilty march 7 to five counts of murder and agreed to 
testify for the prosecution he had been charged with five counts 
each of aggravated murder and kidnapping

serious when he told lubbock pawnbroker stacy nichols that he

marimba music blared from 
loudspeakers the former first lady wore a baseball cap and the 
new president made her entrance to a hail of water balloons 
the inauguration of violeta barrios de chamorro held in a 
managua baseball stadium wednesday was hardly a solemn and 
decorous affair of state 
the scene was 21000seat rigoberto lopez perez stadium named 
after the poet who assassinated the first of the somoza family 
dictators 
sandinista loyalists filled the stands between center field and 
the third base line wearing the partys colors of red and black 
the sandinistas cheered representatives of nations like cuba and 
the soviet union while booing envoys of disliked nations 
assassin assassin they chanted when vice president dan 
quayle went by el salvadors rightist president alfredo 
cristiani got the same greeting 
outgoing president daniel ortega entered on foot along with his 
wife poet rosario murillo who was dressed in skintight denim 
pants high boots a red and black shirt huge silver earrings and 
a red baseball cap 
partisans of the united national opposition pelted them with 
watermelon rinds and blueandwhite uno flags and police quickly 
charged into the stands mrs chamorro still on crutches with a 
broken knee entered five minutes later standing in the back of a 
white pickup dressed in white 
sandinista crowd lobbed waterfilled plastic bags at the 
silverhaired widow drenching several of her police escorts and 
splattering her skirt 
the 60yearold president dodged the missiles kept her footing 
and waved as her truck reached friendly territory the side of the 
stadium where a mass of blueandwhite uno and national flags waved 
applause rang out as she made her way up the stairs to the 
ceremonial platform a crutch under one arm and her hand on the 
railing and took her place beside ortega 
the stadium began filling hours before the ceremony began under 
a hot blue tropical sky with marimba music going full blast the 
sandinistas chanted militaristic party slogans 
finally a sandinista waving a huge party flag dashed onto 
center field to cheers whistles and applause several uno 
supporters in turn made a dash for center field with their flags 
they were tackled by police 
riot police streamed out and took up positions on both sides of 
the field about an hour before the dignitaries began arriving 
however the carnival atmosphere calmed when mrs chamorro began 
her speech 
as she spoke the sandinistas fell silent and many quietly 
filed out of the stadium

a con man who has admitted repeatedly lying to 
prosecutors and judges testified wednesday that the accused gunman 
in a brooklyn racial killing admitted committing the crime while 
they were in jail together 
robert russo testified he was in protective custody at the 
brooklyn house of detention with joseph fama in september when the 
19yearold murder defendant told him about killing 16yearold 
yusef hawkins 
he said he popped him because he was a nigger fama said he 
popped him hawkins russo testified under questioning by 
assistant district attorney edward boyar 
russo said another murder defendant keith mondello also told 
him about the incident when they met in jail but because russo was 
called as a witness against only fama justice thaddeus owens of 
brooklyn state supreme court would not permit russo to repeat 
mondellos alleged statements 
another inmate charles brown testified last week that fama 
also confessed to the killing to him 
fama and mondello also 19 are being tried on murder and other 
charges for the aug 23 slaying of hawkins in the bensonhurst 
neighorhood of brooklyn the black youth was murdered when he and 
three friends also black crossed paths with a mob of whites 
wielding basebll bats in the mostly white neighborhood 
fama is accused of being the triggerman while mondello allegedly 
was the ringleader of the attacking gang 
one of the teenagers with hawkins claude stanford 18 told 
the jury all of a sudden we were surrounded by some guys many 
carrying bats 
stanford said he didnt see the gunman but he said mondello 
whom he picked out of a lineup a few days later was standing 
before him with a bat 
under questioning by fama defense lawyer david depetris russo 
a cocaine user who has been in and out of jail since 1972 admitted 
to being a career confidence artist and to repeatedly lying to 
judges and prosecutors to get out of jail 
i have a problem that i turn to conning when things get 
rough russo said 
russo sentenced last fall to 4 to 9 years in jail on robbery 
charges stemming from a scheme in which he persuaded taxi drivers 
to give him cash to invest said he hoped to cut his jail time by 
testifying against fama 
he said he ran his schemes to cover a 100 to 200 a day cocaine 
habit and while in jail often provided information to law 
enforcers 
at one point when depetris showed scorn for him russo said 
did you expect an angel to sit on this stand 
russo said he easily gained the confidence of fama and mondello 
because he grew up in bensonhurst and knew some of the same people 
they knew

angolas foreign minister on wednesday 
announced his government would soon begin direct peace talks with 
the unita rebels 
pedro van dunem said the talks would begin within a few days 
but that the exact dates or location had yet to been agreed upon 
we are convinced the talks will help us find the path to 
national reconciliation in angola he said 
a unita spokesman in new york abel chivukuvuku described the 
planned talks as preliminary and said they were likely to take 
place in lisbon where a unita team was already in place 
angola gained independence from portugal in november 1975 
van dunem complained the united states and south africa were 
resupplying the rebels with logistical aid weapons and ammunition 
and warned that such aid could hamper the talks 
but aubrey k dwyer spokesman for the south african mission 
said south african aid to the rebels had stopped under a 1988 
agreement 
so far as we know factually we are not giving any physical 
support to unita he said by telephone 
unita spokesman chivukuvuku also denied the angolan assertion of 
fresh south african military aid being given to unita which is the 
portuguese acronym for the national union for the total liberation 
of angola 
the angolan minister also said cuban troops which had fought 
unita rebels for years were being withdrawn on schedule he said 
more than 35000 had left and about 15000 remained 
he said angolas leftist government was instituting major 
economic and political reforms including implementing the 
marketoriented economic prescriptions of the world bank and 
international monetary fund 
the minister also said angola was laying groundwork for free 
general elections and that the creation of separate executive 
legislative and judiciary branches was under discussion

after years of delay and a 
lastminute snag the hubble space telescope was freed from the 
shuttle discovery on wednesday and glinting in the sunlight 
drifted into orbit on its 15year search for new worlds 
mission specialist steven hawley released hubble from the end of 
the shuttles 50footlong mechanical arm after a delay in getting 
one of the telescopes solar wings unfurled 
the first of nasas great observatories is now on station at 
330 nautical miles above the earth mission controls jeffrey 
carr said 
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and 
we sure hope it does good work discovery commander loren j 
shriver said later 
the 15 billion telescope was released at 338 pm edt as the 
shuttle entered its 20th orbit of earth nearly two hours and one 
orbit later than planned the shuttle then backed away 
thank you very much for the ride said mike harrington 
director of orbital verifications at goddard space flight center in 
greenbelt md 
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had 
been in the shuttles airlock ready to walk inspace to free the 
solar panel that proved to be unnecessary 
close but no cigar but better for the hubble that it went the 
way it did sullivan said she and mccandless had trained for 
nearly five years to make such a rescue mission 
the first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday wednesday 
as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles or 330 nautical miles 
above south americas eastern coast it started providing power to 
the telescopes batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of 
charge 
deployment of the starboard panel however was more 
troublesome it wouldnt budge when latches were first released 
then moved about a fifth of its 39foot length and stopped again 
a third attempt rolled the panel out all the way 
houston we see motion commander loren j shriver reported 
hawley began the long process of releasing hubble shortly after 
7 am edt when he grasped it with discoverys 50footlong 
mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12ton telescope high 
above the shuttle 
hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was 
lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own 
nickelhydrogen batteries 
at one day seven minutes into the flight of discovery hubble 
is now on its own internal power carr said the game has 
begun the race is on the clock is ticking 
worries that the telescopes instruments would be starved for 
electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out 
television cameras aboard discovery showed the first array as it 
was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily the sun reflecting 
off the goldcolored panel and silvery telescope 
discovery was 380 statute miles above earth 70 miles higher 
than any shuttle has ever flown the orbit was dictated by the need 
to put the telescope above the earths distorting atmosphere 
discoverys five astronauts were awed by the view 
id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard 
astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks 
far away today shriver said of hawley 
astronomers have waited seven years for hubble to take its place 
in space the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 
1983 but technical problems and the challenger explosion pushed it 
back 
the mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power 
unit on discovery forced the national aeronautics and space 
administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before 
april 10s scheduled liftoff 
on tuesday discovery finally blasted into space transporting 
hubble out of this world and in search of others 
the telescopes 10foot aperture door is to be opened friday 
exposing the finely polished 945inch mirror to starlight 
discovery was following hubble in case the door does not open 
properly if a problem develops mccandless and sullivan will be 
prepared once again to walk in space 
fred wojtalik hubble project manager said the telescope would 
be tested thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture 
door is opened 
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the 
hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he 
said 
the telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the 
sensitivity of its five instruments 
if all goes well the crew will land sunday at edwards air force 
base calif 
nasa expects to release its first image from the telescope of 
an open star cluster in the constellation carina on tuesday data 
will follow in a month or two 
astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the 
time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been 
traveling to earth for 14 billion years they expect to determine 
precisely how and when the universe was formed currently estimated 
at 15 billion years ago 
the telescope is named for the late american astronomer edwin p 
hubble who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was 
expanding he also was responsible for helping to form the big bang 
theory of creation

the government announced wednesday that 
it will fire thousands of public workers and sell off hundreds of 
official mansions apartments and vehicles 
the monthold administration of president fernando collor de 
mello trying to slash hyperinflation and a huge government 
deficit already has drastically limited bank withdrawals and plans 
to sell billions of dollars worth of publicly owned businesses 
secretary of administration joao santana said the reforms made 
out of economic necessity will save brazil 860 million this year 
however it is only half the cuts collor promised during his 
campaign 
santana told a news conference the government identified 11354 
workers holding more than one public job accounting for 25740 
federal positions 
they will have 30 days to justify their situation or lose at 
least one of their jobs he said 
santana said the government expected to save 34 million a month 
by doing away with double jobholding bonuses for top employees 
and highsecurity job categories 
the reforms are the most radical in brazils history they are 
aimed at reducing a bloated inefficient bureaucracy and cutting 
expenses considered largely responsible for brazils 2700 percent 
inflation last year 
santana who is in charge of the reform program also said 23 
state companies were being eliminated and 12000 workers with less 
than five years on the job would be fired 
congress has approved the cuts 
brazil has more than 700000 federal employees a new 
constitution enacted in 1988 gives workers job stability after five 
years 
the government also announced the sale of nine mansions and 
9391 apartments that were reserved for ministers and high 
functionaries as well as 2500 cars and planes tugboats and 350 
dredges 
santana said the money saved could pay for 87000 lowcost 
houses or pay the salaries of 151775 teachers or 88000 doctors 
but he added the government must eliminate its budget 
deficit and these funds will enter the national treasury to cover 
gaps 
the savings from the austerity measures still are far below what 
collor promised when he took office mar 15 he predicted spending 
cuts of 175 billion equal to about 2 percent of brazils 350 
billion gross domestic product 
the next step in the governments plan is a national 
privatization program that calls for the sale of many of brazils 
188 state companies which have a combined debt of 62 billion 
the brazilian congress has authorized the sale of most 
government companies except for the oil monopoly petrobras the 
postal service the telecommunications giant embratel development 
banks and the bank of brazil the countrys largest commercial bank 
foreign capital can acquire only 49 percent of stock in 
privatized companies and 33 percent of voting capital

secretary of defense richard cheney said 
wednesday the united states is obligated to remain strong 
militarily because of the soviet unions past abuses of power and 
uncertainty over its commitment to reform 
the new openness has not yet transformed hope into the reality 
of a freer government cheney said and that reality is what we 
need to see to allay the fears of the rest of the world about the 
soviets enormous military power 
until that happens until we are confident that moscow will 
not again use its military capability to conquer and intimidate 
soviet glasnost will only be a partial answer to our defense 
concerns said cheney addressing the american newspaper 
publishers associations annual conference 
he said that moscows response to lithuanias fight for 
independence is a lead indicator of future soviet developments 
if the solution that ultimately develops is based on peaceful 
action not coercion then confidence in soviet reform will 
grow cheney said but we will draw very different conclusions 
if this issue is resolved by military force and intimidation the 
tactics of empire and not of reform 
cheney after giving a litany of past soviet aggressions said 
he remains skeptical about soviet intentions 
he said that despite soviet promises to reduce troops nearly a 
halfmillion soviet soldiers remain in eastern europe 
he cited a report from a group of soviet officials this week 
that the cia had underestimated the percentage of soviet gnp 
devoted to the military 
they said the cia was overly optimistic about developments 
inside the soviet union it seems to me ive had the same 
problem he said 
cheney acknowledged that reforms are under way but he said the 
transformation of soviet society is just beginning 
overall the world is looking for open political arrangements 
among the peoples of the soviet union based on democratic values 
not coercion he said 
the bush administration optimistic that such change is 
possible is working with the soviet union to reduce strategic and 
conventional armaments and restructure us military forces to 
lower defense costs cheney said 
but we have to remember that there is a point below which we 
can go and still provide the global defense we need in the years 
ahead he added 
security threats were not invented by the communist party of 
the soviet union and threats will remain long after that party has 
gone out of business cheney said

a judge rejected a motion wednesday to dismiss 
murder charges against a man accused of torching an illegal social 
club and killing 87 revelers 
defense attorney richard w berne had asked for the dismissal on 
grounds that he had not had access to a videotaped statement taken 
from julio gonzalez by police before a grand jury indicted him 
gonzalez has pleaded innocent to 174 counts of murder 
state supreme court judge burton r roberts rejected bernes 
motion and set may 30 for gonzalez next court appearance when it 
was expected that a psychiatric report would be available 
gonzalez 36 has been held in a prison ward at a psychiatric 
hospital since his arrest in the predawn fire that killed 87 
people at the happy land social club march 25 
he faces charges of murder by arson and murder by depraved 
indifference for each of the victims plus two counts of arson and 
one count each of assault and attempted murder 
police say gonzalez a cuban immigrant admitted setting the 
fire after an argument with a former girlfriend who worked at the 
club she was one of five people known to have escaped the fire 
most of the victims were honduran immigrants 
meanwhile a group of hondurans said they would appeal to 
roberts to reconsider his position that gonzalez a cuban 
immigrant could draw only one maximum 25yeartolife sentence 
even if convicted on all counts that could make him eligible for 
parole in 25 years 
roberts has said new york law provides for concurrent rather 
than consecutive sentences in cases where multiple deaths result 
from one criminal act 
we feel that this is too narrow an interpretation of the 
law jose velasquez a civil engineer said outside the courtroom 
after wednesdays hearing 
velasquez said a petition drive among an estimated 50000 
hondurans living in the city would be conducted by a newly formed 
group calling itself the federation of honduran organizations in 
new york

a newspaper has pulled advertisements featuring 
polish leader lech walesa speaking in broken english after mayor 
john o norquist and others complained the ad amounted to an ethnic 
slur 
the milwaukee journal used newspaper television and radio 
advertisements featuring walesa and british prime minister margaret 
thatcher to promote the newspapers new page designs unveiled this 
month 
the walesa newspaper advertisement shows a photo of the nobel 
prizewinning founder of polands solidarity movement with the 
words very long i have hoped for changes so significant as those 
in new milwaukee journal 
the thatcher ad pictures the prime minister with the words why 
yes the american colonies have progressed consider the recent 
changes in your milwaukee journal 
both ads involved contrived quotes 
robert dye spokesman for the journal said the ads were 
intended to be lighthearted spoofs and both were pulled this 
week 
i guess it just didnt click dye said it didnt have the 
impact we intended the original intent was that it be fun as soon 
as we realized it wasnt working we pulled the ads 
the quarterpage walesa ad ran in mondays journal editions it 
drew an immediate letter from norquist who complained the use of 
the broken english shows an obvious lack of respect for walesa 
and for polish culture 
im sure that since english is not his native language he 
probably does not speak it as well as you do norquist wrote to 
journal editor sig gissler at the same time i wonder how well 
you speak polish 
the head of the citys annual polish ethnic festival charged the 
television advertisement featuring walesa was even more degrading 
to poles 
i thought it rather demeaning to the polish ethnic groups 
said richard gralinski executive director of polish fest i 
certainly thought it was an ethnic slur 
milwaukee a city of about 600000 people has more than 180000 
residents of polish ancestry gralinski noted

while poachers have decimated wild 
animals throughout most of africa a crackdown on illegal hunters 
in uganda has boosted herds of elephants in wildlife sanctuaries 
the government said wednesday 
the elephant population in ruwenzori national park has swelled 
from 450 three years ago to 700 uganda national parks director 
eric edroma told reporters the reserve was home to 3000 of the 
animals in the 1960s 
after ugandas independence from britain in 1962 government 
troops guerrillas poachers and hungry villagers combined to 
slaughter thousands of pachyderms throughout the country edroma 
said 
most were gunned down when former dictator idi amin ruled the 
east african nation from 1971 to 1979 mainly by soldiers with 
machine guns who smuggled the ivory to the middle east and asia 
by 1980 a year after idi amin was toppled in a military coup 
only 150 elephants were roaming ruwenzori park in western uganda 
when president yoweri museveni seized power in 1986 he vowed to 
protect wildlife and mounted a nationwide sweep against poachers 
today apart from 450 elephants that remain within the 
1200squaremile sanctuary 250 migrants divide their time between 
ruwenzori and the virunga national park in neighboring zaire 
the elephant population throughout the continent has plummeted 
from 15 million in 1978 to as few as 400000 because of widespread 
poaching often with the connivance of politicians bureaucrats and 
security chiefs

colonization of our land by turkey when we ourselves facilitate 
the colonization of the occupied territories of other states the 
rightwing agon wrote 
the northern section of cyprus is occupied by turkish troops 
and thousand of mainland turks have been moved into the area

attacks by arab groups that have threatened to strike against 
facilities used by soviet jewish immigrants on their way to israel

terrorist threats made by arab extremist groups which have 
threatened to attack facilities and carriers used by the soviet

the st louis sun which hoped to be the first 
major metropolitan newspaper to make a successful launch in this 
country since world war ii unexpectedly folded wednesday after 
only seven months 
at a news conference ralph ingersoll ii editor in chief of the 
new newspaper said the st louis sun had published its last 
edition tuesday night 
closing the sun was a decision the st louis marketplace made 
for us said ingersoll who is also chairman and chief executive 
officer of princeton njbased ingersoll publications co since 
launching the sevenday morning tabloid sept 25 1989 the 
newspaper had published 213 editions 
it is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation 
to make this enterprise viable and so we have concluded that there 
is no longer room in st louis for a third newspaper in addition to 
our own suburban journals and the postdispatch ingersoll said 
the sun struggled to overcome higherthanexpected costs 
revolvingdoor circulation limited advertising and a murky image 
the newspaper also had troubles developing everyday readers 
the decision to stop the presses was made sunday ingersoll 
said but apparently few people knew until hours before the news 
conference 
he said the closure which will cost 194 employees their jobs 
stemmed from a failure to build singlecopy sales through vending 
machines and retail outlets and wasnt based on any pressure from 
advertisers or investors 
it had nothing to do with money youll have to take my word 
for it ingersoll said it had to do with single copy sales 
the sun is owned by ingersoll newspapers which owns 77 other 
papers and is part of ralph ingersoll iis newspaper holdings 
on april 1 the newspaper had a circulation of 109000 up from 
a low of 80000 during the winter aided by the start of a new 
bingo promotion ingersoll had guaranteed advertisers 
circulation of 105000 for the first six months of 1990 
the sun also was criticized by some as sensationalizing stories 
for its coverage of a politician involved in a sexual assault and 
of the fiveyear anniversary of an accident in which a man was 
nearly sawed in two 
the newspaper was further chided for running photos of new 
womens swimsuits and lingerie 
but the sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build 
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing st louis 
major air carrier trans world airlines 
some critics derided the suns flood of promotions fluorescent 
green billboards and contests but sun executives defended those 
practices as the best way to encourage people to give their paper a 
try 
in making the surprise announcement ingersoll was flanked by 
postersize blowups of various pages of the sun also on hand were 
publisher tom tallarico who left the postdispatch to join the 
sun and robert jelenic president of ingersoll publications co 
lorraine orlandi a reporter who joined the paper when it was 
launched said the 4 pm announcement came as a shock and some 
employees cried but within about two hours staff members had 
brought cases of beer into the newsroom 
we were putting out a newspaper today i had just returned 
from city hall with a couple of stories to write ms orlandi 
said 
the people here are not gloomy people are in shock she 
said there were no visible signs that we were shutting down or 
even cutting back there were renovations going on 
in an interview earlier this month ingersoll said the two main 
problems facing the sun were higherthanexpected circulation costs 
and a whopping turnover rate among home subscribers 
ingersoll said at the time the company had been forced to spend 
5 million more than planned to distribute the newspaper because 
twice as many readers as expected wanted their newspapers delivered 
advertisers consider that to be very good but its much more 
expensive than we planned for ingersoll said 
but home subscribers also were canceling their subscriptions at 
an extremely fast rate making it difficult for the sun to sign up 
enough new subscribers to keep circulation from falling 
william woo editor of the postdispatch said the sun had set 
out on a difficult mission 
we are saddened for the people who worked hard at the sun and 
we are saddened for those in st louis who depended upon the 
paper woo said in a statement the postdispatchs circulation 
is about 375000 monday through friday and 565000 on sunday 
the announcement came five days after ingersoll had a setback in 
his effort to resolve problems with junkbond debt at another of 
his companies community newspapers inc 
ingersoll offered to buy back at cutrate prices more than half 
of the companys 240 million in junk bonds which it used for 
expansion but no bondholders signed up to sell their bonds back to 
ingersoll even though the bonds have been trading at an even lower 
price about 40 cents on the dollar than what he offered 
if the company cant agree with bondholders on a buyback it 
could be forced to more than double the interest rate on some of 
the bonds this june to a rate of more than 26 percent 
ingersoll said those problems were unrelated to the sun

princeton university students ended a 
32hour occupation of presidents harold shapiros office 
wednesday after officials agreed to expand programs dealing with 
sexual harassment and assault 
university officials refused to meet the specific demands of the 
30 students who invaded the office early tuesday but they agreed 
to devote more resources to expand the programs to include graduate 
students 
if the counseling center needs more staff to do so the 
university will provide it vice president thomas wright said in a 
statement 
the students had demanded that center staff be doubled to three 
fulltime therapists 
the administration is delighted that weve resolved this issue 
without violent confrontation without having to result to the 
use of force said princeton spokeswoman jacquelyn savani 
the university also agreed to create a task force to design the 
new programs and to hold a forum in the fall to address the 
centers needs 
the protesters say 208 students sought counseling at the center 
during the 198889 academic year up from fewer than 50 the year 
before 
wright had said tuesday that the administration could not 
increase funding for a program in the middle of the school year 
he told the students to follow formal channels and appeal to the 
priorities committee which meets in the fall and makes budget 
recommendations for the following school year 
the students said conventional channels had provided little 
satisfaction 
shapiro left his office shortly after the students arrived at 
about 9 am tuesday officials said he then left campus for 
several days of meetings in washington 
talks between the students and other officials deadlocked 
tuesday about 50 student sympathizers held an allnight vigil 
outside the building said student spokesman matthew polly 
the sexual harassmentassault advising resources and education 
center serves about 2300 students largely new freshmen 
according to its annual report of the 208 people who sought 
counseling during the 198889 school year 71 said they were 
victims of sexual harassment or assault incest or violence within 
a relationship 
in all but eight cases the victims were women in all but one 
case the alleged assailants were men

a federal judge whose colleague was 
assassinated last year was being driven to work by us marshals 
when the cars rear window shattered launching a police sweep that 
found it was likely an accident 
the sedan was carrying 11th us circuit court of appeals judge 
jl edmondson from his suburban home to the atlanta court around 
830 am when the rear window broke authorities reported 
no one was hurt and after several nervous hours investigators 
said it was likely that no one was meant to be despite initial 
police reports that someone had fired a gun at the car 
there is no reason for anyone to assume at this point there 
was any effort to injure the judge said stephen boyle spokesman 
for the us marshals service in washington there is no evidence 
to suggest there was a projectile of any sort intended to cause 
harm 
investigators surmised that a defective window simply shattered 
or that an abrupt temperature change in the car broke the glass 
security has been tight around 11th circuit judges since judge 
robert vance of alabama was killed dec 16 by one of four mail 
bombs sent to judicial and civilrights targets in the southeast 
the us marshals service has been escorting the judges to and from 
work 
on dec 18 another of the mail bombs killed a savannah civil 
rights attorney robert robinson 
soon after the car window broke wednesday gwinnett county 
police spokesman larry walton reported that an unknown 
individual had apparently shot at the vehicle as it 
rolled through the city of lawrenceville 
a helicopter began searching and lawrenceville police chief 
robert sutton said officers had converged on a possible suspect in 
a nearby subdivision 
police cordoned off and swarmed into the area alarming local 
workers but found no suspect 
and at midday federal investigators said they had been unable 
to confirm that any object was fired at the car fbi spokesman dan 
eramian in washington said no projectile was found in or around the 
vehicle 
police were on the roof everywhere 20 to 30 of them said 
rita mcmahon an employee at the finamart store a block away from 
where the window broke 
the judges car pulled into the parking lot of a nearby county 
school system building and police ordered employees not to leave 
the area said schools spokeswoman berney kirkland 
and workers locked themselves in an office in nearby button 
gwinnett hospital where spokesman gary morris said police and news 
helicopters were landing and taking off all morning

inspired by henry david thoreaus 19thcentury 
homage to walden pond a group of celebrities launched an 
international fundraising campaign wednesday to buy historic land 
slated for development around it 
the leader of the group singersongwriter don henley displayed 
a check for 250000 in announcing plans to save walden woods the 
onceunspoiled forest that thoreau retreated to more than 130 years 
ago to write his classic walden 
seated in two neat rows at historic faneuil hall and sipping 
individual bottles of evian water were such celebrities as don 
johnson best known for his role as a cop on miami vice ed 
begley jr who recently played a philandering husband in the film 
she devil bonnie raitt whose latest hit is titled thing 
called love and dana delany who plays the tough army nurse on 
china beach 
when i was 17 and went to school in andover i went to walden 
pond and went skinny dipping there said delany dressed in a 
black leather jacket and black stirrup pants i was 
understandably aghast when i heard what was happening there 
henry david thoreau was 150 years ahead of his time said 
the 42yearold henley wearing a suit with a slicked back ponytail 
and glasses his writing presaged the environmental movement and 
it seems appropriate to save his lands 
the money was raised from ticket sales to two concerts headlined 
by henley raitt bob seger glenn frey john cougar mellencamp and 
others at the worcester centrum this week 
henley organized the benefits after seeing a report on cable 
news network earlier this year about the proposed development of a 
condominium project and office park near walden pond 
the plan of the walden woods project is to raise the estimated 
8 million needed to buy the lands from developers mortimer 
zuckerman and philip de normandie henley said wednesday that 
zuckerman has donated 100000 to the project 
the celebrities plan also calls for the construction of 
affordable housing farther away from walden woods 
others involved in the project include michael kennedy son of 
the late sen robert f kennedy and cochairman of the walden woods 
project with henley novelist el doctorow former us sen paul 
tsongas and various state officials and environmental leaders 
these places of refuge are going to become paramount 
johnson said its up to us to take a stand if were going to 
have a place to go and contemplate and know the earth as it once 
was 
doctorow author of the bestselling ragtime said 
thoreau was an everyman and he chose walden to be his 
everywhere walden is a book that could only be written by an 
american we wouldnt exist as a people without this book we have 
to be able to say you read the book now see the place 
walden pond is a 62acre body of water in a 333acre state 
reservation on the edge of concord an affluent town of 12500 
about 20 miles from boston 
the pond however is far less pastoral than when walden lived 
by its shore in a tiny shack in 1845 it lies less than a hundred 
yards from a highway and is adjacent to a garbage dump

sixtytwo pounds of plutonium lodged 
in the air ducts at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant could 
cause a radiation leak that could kill some workers plant 
operators say 
but the conditions under which that could happen are unlikely to 
occur and egampg inc is working to eliminate all risk of such an 
incident said phil warner rocky flats manager on tuesday 
more than 100 people packed into a meeting of the rocky flats 
environmental monitoring council to hear warner discuss the 
plutonium which has accumulated in the ventilation ductwork at the 
plutonium processing buildings 
warner said plant officials havent decided whether to remove 
the plutonium or when the plutonium processing operations at the 
plant will resume 
the plutonium is contained within the pipes warner said 
when you start talking about removing it theres the possibility 
of plutonium getting in the atmosphere in the building removing 
ducts is not easy 
rocky flats which is operated by egampg for the federal 
department of energy manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons plutonium processing operations were shut down at the 
plant last fall so egampg could implement new safety and 
environmental monitoring programs 
energy secretary james watkins has said he wants the operations 
to resume by the end of june 
the plutonium buildup in the air ducts was discovered during a 
survey of the plant 
federal investigators have said employees using gloveboxes to 
manufacture plutonium triggers often bypassed air filters or poked 
holes in them rather than change them in order to get more work 
done that practice allowed plutonium dust to escape through the 
filters into the air ducts they said

the bush administration is ruling out any

by president bush and an official pat on the back for assisting in 
the liberation of us hostage robert polhill 
while syria has taken certain positive steps since 1986 to 
combat terrorism including its role in the release of mr polhill

toss out those boring ball gowns tedious bows 
gargantuan shoulder pads and thighhigh hemlines style 1990 is 
sumptuous but simple sedate without being dated 
when the world is feeling quiet like it is when it has a lot 
of things to address designers are feeling that too said andy 
basile vice president and fashion director at bergdorf goodman 
fashion experts say designers reflect the national mood 
particularly the current economic climate in the clothes they 
make that means a return for fall to more classic looks customers 
are sure to want 
there is a certain nervousness about what will sell because of 
the retail environment and economic times said patrick mccarthy 
executive editor of womens wear daily people are playing it 
safe 
in their fall 1990 collections presented in recent weeks in 
seventh avenue showrooms and ritzy hotel ballrooms designers 
sought to strike a balance between safe and special the result was 
a quieter look 
the fabrics are sumptuous both in their richness and their 
simplicity beaded and sequinned silks parade alongside cashmeres 
and wools that look soft enough to swaddle a baby the line is 
clean and minimal the silhouette is kind to the body not too 
tight and not too loose 
in his show in the plaza hotels ornate ballroom oscar de la 
renta said goodbye to the ball gown instead he showed long 
evening skirts with multicolored jeweled jackets simply cut from 
dazzling rich fabrics 
collection colors include greens and gold but no loud neonsign 
hues here hemlines show the knee but the legs are covered in 
hosiery the same color as the outfit unitards tights or leggings 
a favorite theme running through the shows was a touch of 
evening elegance in day wear and sporty day accents for night 
donna karan jazzes up daytime cashmeres with black sequin 
scarves her basic unitard becomes a sexy evening outfit when done 
in velvet and worn under a sheer floorlength organza blouse 
the blurring between day and night has a very practical side a 
little mixing and matching makes an item of clothing wearable 
around the clock 
designers also have latched onto outdoor wear like parkas and 
anoraks and transported them from ski slopes and fishing streams 
to exclusive upper east side restaurants and metropolitan opera 
openings 
de la renta showed a quilted floral silk parka striped in gold 
over a silk charmeuse blouse and multicolored sequinned skirt 
calvin klein a master of quiet understated clothes came up 
with lots of turtleneck sweaters worn over short skirts with 
tights one of his best was a forest green fishermans sweater with 
a spruce and black plaid wrap skirt and loden and gray shawl 
in her review bernadine morris of the new york times called his 
collection quiet wonderful and just about perfect 
but wwd gave him a b in its review and commented its 
unfortunate that calvin one of americas most important and most 
prosperous designers plays it so safe 
no one could have been bored at the geoffrey beene show beenes 
sculpted clothes are pared down to the simplest shapes perfectly 
proportioned his streamlined catsuits twopiece tweed suits and 
long monastic dresses are accented by triangular inserts 
asymmetrical belts standup collars and slim leather halters that 
slip over one shoulder 
his colors often somber can be vibrant a highcollared 
longsleeved monastic gown is regal in a floral pattern of hunter 
green and gold 
the result is ultramodern clothing that would be at home in a 
star trek vessel

and he went out from pharaoh in hot anger 
so reads exodus 118 about moses in the revised standard version of 
the bible a new clearer rendering reads and in hot anger he 
left pharaoh 
thats a sample of the clarifying changes made in the new 
revised standard version reaching bookstores in may after 15 years 
work by an interfaith team of scripture scholars 
seeking greater accuracy clarity and more natural intelligible 
and flowing english the revision refines phrasing in what has been 
americas most broadly endorsed version of scripture the rsv 
that 38yearold version holds approval of most major 
protestant roman catholic and eastern orthodox denominations its 
the first version to gain that common acceptance says the rev 
gerald knoff veteran christian educator 
the revision of it the nrsv produced by a 30member group of 
protestant roman catholic eastern orthodox and jewish scholars 
draws on older original manuscripts for correctness and also 
sharpens the english wording 
those that were sent went reads luke 1932 in the old rsv 
but the nrsv puts it more smoothly those who were sent 
departed 
an instance of greater precision is amos 65 which in the old 
wording cites those who like david invent for themselves 
instruments of music now it says those who like david 
improvise on instruments of music 
the rev bruce m metzger of princeton theological seminary the 
courtly and learned bible scholar who headed the translation team 
calls the new version both the newest and oldest 
he said the aim was to be as literal as possible in adhering 
to the ancient hebrew and greek texts but also as free as 
necessary in making the meaning clear in graceful understandable 
english 
the nrsv was produced under auspices of the national council of 
churches which also sparked production of the rsv in 1952 the 
translation team worked without charge unlike translators of many 
other versions 
six different publishing companies are putting out various 
editions of the revision some including the deuterocanonical or 
apocryphal books between the old and new testaments as wanted by 
some denominations 
the rev arthur o van eck head of the councils division of 
education calls the new revision a bible for our time 
in keeping with growing liturgical usage the revision replaces 
the former uses of thee and thou in addressing god with 
you metzger noted the original texts use the same pronoun in 
addressing god and people 
despite some pressures for more sexually inclusive terms 
metzger said that was done only when the text allowed it concerning 
people pronouns remain masculine in referring to god and jesus 
there was no tampering with the gender of deity metzger 
said god remains our father and jesus christ is the son of 
god 
however he said english unlike hebrew and greek lacks a 
commongender thirdperson pronoun leading to a masculine bias to 
male pronouns about people in past translations although the 
original text is more inclusive 
for instance in the rsv john 2l0 reads every man serves 
the good wine first but the text doesnt specify man 
consequently the revision reads everone serves the good wine 
first 
other corrections of unnecessary masculine renderings include 
matthew 44 which in the rsv reads man does not live by bread 
alone one replaces man in the revision 
in the song of solomon metzger said that in the sentence i 
am black but beautiful the conjunction and replaces 
but which had implied black isnt beautiful 
he said the change also conforms with the usual translation of 
the hebrew wordwa which 49 out of 50 times is translated as 
and not but 
samples of other changes 
deuteronomy 295 rsv your sandals have not worn off your 
feet nrsv your sandals have not worn out on your feet 
hebrews 1116 rsv god prepared for them a city nrsv 
god prepared a city for them 
psalm 509 rsv i will accept no bull from your house 
nrsv i will not accept a bull from your house 
first samuel 2411 rsv though you hunt my life to take it 
nrsv though you are hunting me to take my life 
second corinthians 611 rsv our mouth is open to you 
corinthians our heart is wide nrsv we have spoken frankly 
to you corinthians our heart is wide open to you 
psalm 988 rsv let the hills sing for joy together nrsv

the voice was reedy highpitched solemn it 
belonged to abraham lincoln delivering his first inaugural 
address trying desperately to preserve a union but the sentiment 
could come these days from mikhail gorbachev 
in your hands said lincoln addressing the south or could say 
gorbachev addressing lithuania and not in mine is the momentous 
issue of the civil war the government will not assail you but i 
hold that in contemplation of universal law and the constitution 
the union of these states is perpetual no state upon its own 
mere action can lawfully get out of the union 
the parallel between lincoln seeking to preserve the union 
and gorbachev seeking to preserve the union of soviet socialist 
republics has occurred at least it occurred to yuri a reshetov 
he runs the soviet foreign ministrys department for 
international humanitarian cooperation and human rights at a news 
conference on april 9 he sought american forbearance by comparing 
lincolns and gorbachevs struggle to preserve their unions 
reshetov said he had visited the lincoln memorial the previous 
day 
abraham lincoln saved the american union he said we the 
soviets have been together with lithuania with estonia and with 
latvia for many many years he said i still hope that what 
unites us is much stronger than what is capable of leading to 
dissolution of our union 
all of which draws a deep hooting laugh from harold hyman a 
rice university professor and expert in both constitutional and 
american civil war history 
let me call it a strained analogy a kind of twistery instead 
of history says hyman 
says mary k bonsteel tachau a constitutional historian at the 
university of louisville i appreciate his position but i think 
his analogy is unhistoric he is obviously grasping 
william m wiecek son of an immigrant professor of law and of 
history at syracuse university attacks the analogy most succinctly 
he points out that the original 13 states of the american union 
voluntarily formed and ratified the union and the other 37 states 
petitioned to be admitted 
lithuania by contrast was taken over by the russians under the 
terms of a secret pact between stalin and hitler which wiecek 
calls one of the most loathsome agreements of modern times 
in both instances the people of the seceding entity through 
their elected representatives voted to secede however in the 
case of the south no one polled the vast numbers of residents who 
happened to be black and in bondage those who held the whip were 
those who had the vote 
and yet wiecek is willing to grant gorbachev and reshetov a 
point the soviet leader perhaps has the right and duty to try to 
oversee a smooth secession rather than a chaotic one 
says wiecek as a historian it is always misleading to argue 
from parallels drawn from completely different civilizations with 
that qualification in mind i think there is something to be said 
for the soviet officials idea in the sense that the chief 
executive officer of any modern state has a responsibility if not 
to prevent secession at least to manage a change in relations so 
that the interests of the state itself and the seceding entity are 
preserved 
what would george bush do he asks if alaska attempted to 
secede 
so the reshetov attempt to bend american history into a soviet 
parallel doesnt work but anarchy doesnt work either 
no one not soviets not lithuanians not americans wants to 
see the price half a million lives that was paid on american 
soil to establish the antisecessionist principle that lincoln laid 
down and reshetov would adopt as his own

by pleading guilty to financial crimes michael 
milken has exposed himself to years in prison but avoided another 
ordeal a daily run through the gantlet of cameras outside 
manhattans federal courthouse 
hes always hated to have his picture taken says allan 
sloan a financial columnist who has spoken with milken many times 
its not really a phobia its part of his control thing 
if so the prospect of following in the steps of leona helmsley 
imelda marcos bess myerson and other celebrities who have stood 
trial in new york must have seemed particularly depressing 
because there are only a few routes into the courthouse 
criminal defendants must pass a battery of cameras each day 
although some enjoy it for most its a pain in the neck said 
jules ritholz a prominent defense lawyer 
milkens suspicion of the lens is considered legendary it is 
said that he steadfastly refused to be photographed for drexel 
burnham lamberts annual report even though he created and ran the 
firms vaunted junk bond department 
he also sought to control who photographed him how the photos 
would be shot and where they would go when photographer george 
steinmetz arrived at milkens beverly hills office in 1987 to shoot 
the financier he was handed a contract giving milken all rights to 
the photos steinmetz signed it 
that was only the beginning steinmetz later recalled in an 
interview with the new york times 
i wanted to shoot him at his desk surrounded by all his 
traders but they said they didnt want others to be in the 
picture so i suggested photographing him alone at his desk in the 
morning before anyone came in they said that would make him look 
too much like a loner 
steinmetzs request for a photo of milken arriving at work in 
his chauffeured car was rejected because it would make the 
financier look too pampered so finally the photographer had to 
settle for a picture of milken outside his house posed awkwardly in 
a staged game of basketball with some neighborhood kids 
in 1987 sloan then a writer at forbes magazine got an 
interview with milken but getting a photo to accompany the article 
was something else 
we had endless trouble over it sloan recalls we couldnt 
buy any pictures because he had all the rights finally i had to 
call him up and ask him to cooperate i spent an awful lot of 
time trying to get a photo 
milkens indictment and his required appearance before a 
congressional committee ended the photo famine he also appeared at 
a few flattering photo opportunities arranged by his public 
relations consultants but you could see he hated doing it and 
he wasnt good at it sloan says 
to placate the hordes of paparazzi still clamoring for his 
visage milken allowed a photographer to shoot a set of official 
photos which were made available to the news media 
still milkens distaste for photography certainly was no help 
to his lawyers as they negotiated a pretrial settlement with 
prosecutors legal experts said 
fear of photography is one of about 40 reasons why you dont 
want to go to trial says ritholz youve got to factor it into 
your decision 
but i wouldnt make too much of that said stephen gillers 
a new york university law professor i dont think someone is 
going to make a plea bargain decision based on his dislike of being 
photographed youd have to be howard hughes and i dont think 
milkens in that league

need cash fast borrow from yourself and pay 
no interest 
however strange that comeon may sound the proposition it 
embodies can be workable for someone who has accumulated a nest egg 
in an individual retirement account 
but beware like many other types of shortterm emergency 
financing it can be a tightrope walk that imposes severe penalties 
if you take a misstep 
the rules governing iras make it clear that the government 
didnt intend these longterm savings vehicles as any source of 
readily available credit 
they state expressly that if you borrow from an ira or even if 
you pledge money in your account as collateral on a loan you will 
be considered to have made a withdrawal subject to taxes 
for people who have not yet reached age 59 that usually means 
a 10 percent penalty tax in addition to any regular income tax 
obligations you incur 
elsewhere in the dense tangle of ira regulations however there 
is a loophole of sorts that permits people of any age to tap their 
accounts once a year for nointerest loans lasting up to 60 
days 
when you do this you technically do not borrow the money at 
all instead you withdraw it from an account with one custodian to 
roll it over into another with a time limit of no more than 60 
days from the date when you receive the money from the first 
custodian 
before your time runs out what you do with the money is up to 
you buy a car take some speculative fling whatever you wish 
of course if you want to preserve your hardearned ira savings 
and avoid costly tax bills you need to be very sure that you will 
be able to pay yourself back in time 
the device of borrowing from an ira should only be 
considered in situations where it is clear that the funds will be 
available to complete the rollover within the 60day period says 
the research institute of america in a current bulletin on the 
subject 
the institute suggests that it may not be assurance enough to 
simply have what businesses call an account receivable a payment 
somebody owes you that may or may not come in on schedule 
theoretically at least you could take your ira money to the 
bank and buy a 58day certificate of deposit pocketing whatever 
interest the cd earns and then put the principal amount back in a 
new ira 
but if the banks payment to you got held up for just three days 
or so because the mail wasnt delivered or the computer went down 
youd be out of luck the irs takes the position that the time 
limit is a time limit leaving little or no room for excuses or 
exceptions 
this iratocdtoira deal would also have a couple of other 
angles you might want to take into account 
first of all the cd interest unlike investment income earned 
in an ira would be subject to current taxation secondly while 
you had the use of the money it wouldnt be earning anything at 
all for your ira savings 
on top of all that while avoiding taxes in an ira rollover you 
could incur other costs such as withdrawal fees at the old 
custodian or setup fees at the new one that would work against any 
net benefit to you 
considering all the pitfalls involved many ira savers might be 
reluctant ever to plan an actual rollover to get at their cash at 
the same time however they might view it as a nice cushion to 
have in reserve

an interfaith team of scripture experts led by a gentlemannered 
princeton scholar has worked for 15 years producing whats likely 
to become the most widely used bible in american churches 
the new revised standard version put out by six publishers in 
various editions is being distributed in may to bookstores it has 
been authorized and commended by most of the nations major 
denominations 
it offers greater accuracy clarity and naturalness of 
expression said the rev bruce m metzger chairman of the 
30member translation committee that turned out the new rendition 
drawing on older more exact manuscripts and changes in meanings 
of current english the work is a finetuning of the revised 
standard version completed in 1952 and the most broadly endorsed 
version in the years since 
metzger 76 a presbyterian and courtly zestful scripture 
scholar of princeton theological seminary applied this rule in the 
new rendering of the ancient texts as literal as possible as 
free as necessary 
that demanded that the content adhere to what the original 
hebrew and greek manuscripts actually say while phrasing it in 
understandable and graceful english 
we never tampered with meanings metzger said in an 
interview but many archaic usages and sometimes ambiguous or 
obscure passages are clarified in the revised translation 
for example zechariah 33 previously rendered as now joshua 
was standing before the angel clothed in filthy garments 
becomes now joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood 
before the angel 
the nrsv was produced under auspices of the national council of 
churches which also holds the copyright on the predecessor rsv 
endorsed by most major protestant roman catholic and eastern 
orthodox churches 
despite the contemporary proliferation of bible translations 
metzger said the rsv has been the mostly widely used modern 
speech translation in its 38 years it has sold more than 45 
million copies 
revising of it was done by a translation committee of 
protestant roman catholic eastern orthodox and jewish scholars 
biblical scholars these days approach each other in terms of 
scholarshilp not denomination metzger said theres a 
homogeneity in biblical scholarship the likes of which we had not 
seen before 
the differences are in theology not in biblical studies 
irrespective of denominational affiliations matters of theological 
interpretation fall into the background so far as the book goes 
we are essentially one 
most teams producing bible translations are paid for their work 
but the nrsv group labored at their task since 1974 without pay or 
share in royalties its a contribution to the churches 
metzger said 
formal publication date and church celebrations of it were 
scheduled in september but a may 1 start was authorized for 
distribution to stores 
while some feminists pressed for more sexually inclusive 
language in the new translation metzgers criteria required 
adherence to the texts however many terms previously rendered as 
male were originally inclusive 
he said that masculine pronouns or the words man or men 
often were used previously in passages in which the original text 
allows for more generic usage such as one or people 
for example matthew 630 previously was rendered o men of 
little faith but now is rendered you of little faith 
metzger said the word for man wasnt present in the original 
similarly john 1232 previously was rendered and i when i am 
lifted up from the earth will draw all men to myself the latter 
phrase now becomes draw all people to myself 
however pronouns referring to god and jesus remain masculine 
we were not authorized to change them metzger said adding 
that there was no tampering with the gender of deity 
god remains our father and jesus christ is the son of god 
however uses of thee and thou in addressing god are 
changed to you in the hebrew and greek texts the same form 
of the second person pronoun is used in talking to god and 
people metzger said 
he calls the new translation both the newest and oldest 
version since the translators used ancient texts only recently 
discovered such as the dead sea scrolls providing much older 
manuscripts of the old testament 
some previously rendered passages that sometimes drew snickers 
in church readings were changed to correct possible 
misunderstandings 
for instance psalm 509 that previously read i will accept

the post office is proposing a 
revolutionary idea that the 150 million people of latin americas 
largest country pay their bills by mail instead of standing in line 
brazil is modern in many ways but you still cannot write a 
check for your electricity bill put it in a stamped envelope and 
drop it in a mailbox 
virtually all bills are paid at banks which are clogged with 
long lines of grumbling sweaty people holding stacks of 
electricity gas and water bills school department store health 
insurance and credit card accounts auto license fees and 
statements of income or property taxes 
a specialized commercial culture has sprouted around the 
practice companies and wealthy individuals hire young men 
universally called office boys to do their standing and paying 
one companys office boy presented a check to pay the telephone 
bill but the bank insisted on cash he went to the companys own 
bank which said it would take a check but must have a new one 
naming the bank as payee in desperation the office boy returned 
to the first bank where the manager finally made an exception and 
accepted the check 
the post office wants to make things simpler 
its press spokesman jose valfranio medeiros de oliveira said 
in an interview theres nothing easier than paying bills by 
mail and we want to make life easier for our citizens 
some newspapers have begun rather timidly to support the 
program 
yes there is a long tradition here of not paying by mail 
oliveira said but we have the infrastructure we have 
credibility theres no reason this wont work 
this month he said the post office will run a test program 
allowing people in the northeastern state of bahia population 116 
million to pay telephone bills by mail if that goes well the 
experiment will be extended to other states and to bills for water 
gas and federal taxes 
all brazils 4000plus townships have post offices whereas 
onethird dont have banks oliveira said 
in addition there are 22000 public mailboxes and 3000 rural 
collection points on farms and ranches post offices have longer 
hours than banks some post offices are open on weekends 
brazils largest commercial bank the governmentcontrolled 
banco do brasil announced plans for a citizens comfort a 
program that would allow even people without accounts at the bank 
to mail it their checks for water electricity gas and federal tax 
bills 
alberto policaro the bank president said that would make life 
easier for brazilians and free bank workers from receiving bills 
and let them get on with the banks real business taking in 
deposits and making loans 
public acceptance of such a departure is far from universal 
luis santanna mendes a rio teletype operator who used to work 
for the post office telegraph service said id rather wait in 
line at a bank that way you have confirmation that you paid 
at a bank you get a stub with a machine stamp showing the 
amount paid 
oliveira said post offices could provide the same kind of 
receipt that means bill payers would have to line up at the post 
office of course but the press spokesman said our lines move 
faster than bank lines 
surveys by brazils largest private polling company known as 
ibope indicate the post office is brazils most trusted public 
institution but skepticism persists 
you just dont know if the letter really will get there 
mendes said 
another problem is that brazilian banks do not return canceled 
checks they keep check records on microfilm in the case of a 
disputed payment the payer would have to line up at the bank to 
see his account record 
there are technical details to be worked out oliveira 
acknowledged but if you can pay bills by mail in the united 
states and europe theres no reason you cant do it in brazil 
too

much of the world plans reductions in military 
spending but singapore a thriving citystate with no apparent 
enemies is building more bomb shelters 
about 200 shelters and the same number of air raid sirens will 
be completed in the next year and singapore should be ready for its 
first nationwide drill in 1992 home minister shanmugam jayakumar 
said 
the more shelters the better he declared this will mean 
more protection for the public 
protection from what 
southeast asia has been among the worlds more stable regions 
recently but government leaders insist security remains a problem 
despite the improvement in ussoviet relations 
that will not change even if the superpowers reduce their 
military forces in the region said lee hsien loong 37 eldest son 
of prime minister lee kuan yew 
lee addressed parliament as second defense minister he also has 
the trade and industry portfolio and is widely viewed as a future 
prime minister 
if the united states significantly cuts back its military 
forces in the region this will not be a signal for singapore also 
to reduce our forces he said it will be reason for concern 
over a potentially destabilizing change in the regional balance of 
power 
singapore is the only country in the region that openly backs 
continued us military presence officials in several other 
capitals express private support and public nonalignment 
except for singapore the nations of southeast asia think the 
american security shield will stand forever regardless of what 
they do said rep patricia schroeder leader of a house armed 
services committee delegation that toured the area recently 
they can boast of their nonaligned purity while reaping the 
harvest made possible by the american military the colorado 
democrat said 
if the united states cannot renew the leases on philippine bases 
and is forced to leave it will need help from friends in the 
region she said singapore has offered greater access to its air 
and naval facilities 
in his speech to parliament lee said the government would not 
cut defense spending reduce the armed forces or end compulsory 
military training whatever the united states did 
singapore is about the size of chicago with no natural 
resources except a strategic location between the pacific and 
indian oceans and the skills of its 26 million people 76 percent 
of whom are ethnic chinese 
the army navy and air force have 55000 regulars and conscripts 
plus about 200000 reservists analysts rate the singapore armed 
forces among the best trained and equipped in the region 
because it is so small singapore often holds major military 
exercises in brunei taiwan or elsewhere 
it conducts bilateral maneuvers with other members of the 
association of southeast asian nations indonesia malaysia 
thailand brunei and the philippines but asean as a whole does 
not function as a military alliance 
no other asean country is slashing its defense expenditures 
demobilizing its armed forces or acting on the assumption that it 
no longer faces any external threats lee told parliament it 
would be foolhardy for singapore to do so alone 
diplomats from asean countries said the countries awaited 
resolution of two regional problems the search for a peace formula 
in cambodia and negotiations on the us bases 
singapore is in the five power defense agreement with australia 
britain malaysia and new zealand the 1971 pact provides for 
consultation and cooperation among members if singapore or malaysia 
is attacked or threatened 
defense spending is about 6 percent of singapores gross 
national product which means the equivalent of 19 billion in the 
current budget 
us defense spending in 1988 was 61 percent of the gross 
national product or 2931 billion 
some defense funds go to a domestic arms industry that has grown 
so fast it now seeks export orders and diversification 
it was started less than 20 years ago and includes more than 40 
companies under the singapore technologies umbrella the 
governmentbacked companies evolved from making small arms under 
license to designing howitzers and upgrading jet fighters 
singapores total defense plan was drafted in 1983 while 
vietnamese military forces occupied cambodia and aims to involve 
the civilian population with the military in a national emergency 
the first air raid drill sent 3000 volunteers swarming into a 
new subway station in 1988 
nine underground stations have been fortified to shelter 100000 
people shelters also are being built in schools hospitals and 
other public facilities 
other civil defense training covers rescue methods blood 
donation mobilization of private motor vehicles and emergency 
distribution of food and water

a real trouper is one who despite a 
nearfatal gassing can rebound almost immediately to audition for 
a good part 
crystal bernard fits that description its why shes now a 
costar of nbcs wings playing helen chappel an aspiring 
cellist who runs the lunch counter at a small airport on marthas 
vineyard mass 
bernard whose character is the longtime friend of timothy daly 
and steven weber cast as owners of a oneplane commuter airline 
considers herself lucky in more than one way 
she was working on the tv movie without her consent on a day 
when filming was delayed because of lighting problems 
i went to my trailer to lie down and i passed out because of 
carbonmonoxide poisoning she said they found me in the 
trailers toilet about three hours later i was paralyzed i 
couldnt move they rushed me to one hospital then to another 
where i was put into an oxygen chamber 
i was very close to dying when i was released from the 
hospital i had to have someone watch me at night to see that i 
didnt have a seizure when i woke up the next morning i found a 
script on my door it was wings and i went down immediately to 
read for it i know thats ludicrous but i loved it so much 
wings was created by three former producers and writers for 
cheers david angell peter casey and david lee and follows 
cheers on thursdays 
the show which runs for seven episodes has gotten mixed 
reviews from critics but bernard who spent five years on the 
syndicated comedy its a living is convinced its going to 
make it despite tough competition from abcs twin peaks 
bernard spent a year on happy days had a recurring role on 
my two dads and has appeared several times on paradise as a 
school teacher she costarred with michael j fox in the tv movie 
high school usa and earlier this year was seen in the movie 
pilot chameleons 
wings had been delayed for several months because the 
producers had not been able to cast the part of helen which 
originally was conceived as a fiery greek woman 
after bernard was cast she had to complete work on without 
her consent and wait out a commitment to an abc pilot called 
hot prospects production was postponed until january when she 
became available 
her character on the show is like herself from texas but 
unlike bernard shes a woman who has struggled to shed 60 pounds 
shes also fiery and outspoken 
helen has a weight problem and i kind of figure thats why 
shes fiery bernard said people would comment on her weight 
and shed fire back nobody has her number 
bernard says she has been cast in every comedy role shes 
auditioned for but not every venture has been a success 
once on a visit to los angeles for a religious concert with her 
father she tried to get the president of nbc on the telephone to 
tell him she wanted her own variety show 
i had my costumes and everything she said he didnt take 
my call 
later when bernard moved to los angeles the only name she knew 
was modeling agent nina blanchards 
id seen her on the merv griffin show bernard said she 
said i was too short 5foot2 i went back and barged into her 
office she was puffing on a cigarette and said honey youre a 
midget but i think youre going to be a star 
she signed me to a commercials contract and i got a job the 
next day id spent a day and a half as a waitress and i was 
terrible i went from making 350 an hour as a waitress one day to 
1400 a day for four days work on a commercial i thought id 
struck oil 
bernard grew up singing and performing all over the country with 
her father jerry wayne bernard a southern baptist evangelical 
minister 
her older sister robin bernard is on abcs general 
hospital and another sister scarlett was in the movie jack 
in the box her youngest sister angelique is a student at 
baylor university which bernard attended before striking out for 
hollywood 
ive wanted to be an actress since i was 3 she said i 
started imitating cher and barbra streisand and jeannie c riley 
by the time i was in the fifth grade i had a cher act i did all 
over houston for the rotary elks and other clubs

when they found 11yearold billy ruff 
hanged from the big maple tree he loved to climb innocence died in 
the hearts of his brothers and sisters 
they saw his killer everywhere in anyone the surviving ruff 
children five living when billy died 33 years ago three born 
later lived with a fear so deep it darkened every waking moment 
terror inspired by a reallife bogeyman who preyed on happy 
freshfaced kids who loved raisin cookies and baseball 
kids like billy kids like them 
all of us at one time or another didnt think wed reach the 
age of 11 said tim ruff who was 3 when billy died 
then one day three years ago christopher ruff glanced up at the 
bulletin board in the police station where he worked and into the 
face of the man who killed the brother he never knew 
mom and i knew as soon as i called her said chris at 24 
the youngest ruff born eight years after his brothers death and 
two months after his fathers we both started to shake and say 
this is it 
last monday he saw the man again in albany county court 
where he was sentenced to life in prison for billys murder 
it was not murder however that put billys killer on a wanted 
poster it was a sex abuse charge involving a girl about billys 
age the awful secret his family had hidden was that billy ruff had 
been sodomized before he died 
this sort of thing wasnt spoken about mildred ruff said 
sitting in her living room surrounded by six of her children 
people wouldnt talk about child molesting it was a hushhush 
thing 
smith avenue in the northwestern suburb of albany where the 
family lived was a street full of children in a rural landscape of 
fields and trees the day billy ruff disappeared 
he was last seen at 430 pm saturday aug 31 1957 his 
pocket full of raisin cookies in his hand a length of frayed 
clothesline he planned to use to steer a homemade gocart 
he didnt show up for dinner mrs ruff remembers wrapping his 
plate of lamb chops boiled potatoes and corn on the cob in wax 
paper and putting it in the fridge at 9 pm she called her 
husband at work and he began a search that lasted until dawn 
in her fitful sleep that night mrs ruff had a dream or a 
vision she wasnt sure which i saw billy on his knees hanging 
by a rope 
thats the way he was found the next day by a friends daughter 
hanged with his own clothesline in a densely wooded lot where all 
the kids played and played for years after 
police interviewed hundreds of people they didnt care how 
many hours they put in said raymond rasmussen one of the first 
state police detectives put on the case we got to feel very 
close and very compassionate for the family and what theyd been 
through 
what they could not know was that the killer was there among 
them then in the noise and confusion of grief and of police work 
he was gone 
the night of the wake a priest friend of ours said it may 
take 20 years but nobody can keep this thing to themselves mrs 
ruff said and i said if it takes 20 days ill lose my mind 
instead she found strength and faith enough to last her family 
through billys death the death of her husband eight years later 
and her own current fight with cancer for years she carried in 
her apron pocket a rosary her husband had given her the black 
beads wore to brown from constant fingering 
twenty days became 20 months the investigation died down the 
police stopped coming by with mug shots of child molesters 
seven years passed the police came around one last time to tell 
the family a forensics expert had decided billys death was 
accidental his family scoffed they knew the truth would surface 
a belief that never wavered as 10 years became 20 then 30 
we know what its like to have a lot of unanswered 
questions said john born four years after billys murder but 
in the back of our minds there was always the hope 
there was also fear of the dark of being alone of getting 
too close to people 
everybody grew up with a paranoia chris said we couldnt 
have a normal childhood because we were so damn scared theres not 
one time we can walk into an empty house and feel safe not one of 
us 
regina the oldest 13 when billy died and tommy who was 5 
told their mother they knew there was a bogeyman because he got 
their brother all the ruffs regina tom tim joe lisa jay 
john and chris worried he was out to get another of them 
wed stand at the window stand there and watch when people 
werent home on time said lisa who was 8 months old when billy 
was murdered i remember standing at my bed in the back bedroom 
looking out the window and knowing i was doing the same thing as 
mom was we were always scared 
the fear became something they lived and breathed in time they 
would pass it on to their spouses to their children 
i was terrorized by nightmares most of my life regina wrote 
in a recent letter to her mother i had to force myself to go 
anywhere i was afraid of the dark and of the daylight 
all this destruction all this fear and i am only one of 
eight multiply the damage to me by every other life this touched 
while billys brothers and sisters struggled with demons his 
killer was finishing a stint in the air force and spending short 
periods as an albany police officer and an ironworker he married 
three times and fathered two children by a fourth woman in the 
1970s he wandered the streets a homeless alcoholic 
i think he was a man that had this on his mind all that 
time rasmussen said maybe that caused him to become what he 
was

three years five months and 10 days after ivan 
f boesky promised to hand over other wall street cheaters 
investigators corraled the biggest name he dangled before them 
michael r milken 
the emotional guilty plea in federal court tuesday by the former 
head of drexel burnham lambert incs famed junk bond department 
was the holy grail in the governments crusade to weed out 
financial crime 
milken 43 admitted to six counts of violating federal 
securities and tax laws and agreed to pay 600 million in 
penalties he faces up to 28 years in prison at a scheduled oct 1 
sentencing 
the admissions despite milkens previous avowals of innocence 
demonstrate that he stood at the center of a network of 
manipulation fraud and deceit said sec chairman richard breeden 
after boesky pleaded guilty on nov 14 1986 the exspeculator 
provided information that led to milken as well as to several wall 
street investment bankers takeover artists arbitragers bond 
dealers and trading assistants 
but with the exception of one case widely considered ironclad 
the fraud conviction and fouryear prison term for florida investor 
paul bilzerian the government has been criticized for bringing 
weak prosecutions on technical violations 
now the government has succeeded in getting its main target a 
man who built a 200 billion market for highrisk paper and helped 
used to money to feed a takeover boom his plea including a record 
fine against an individual and a potentially long prison term 
they put an end to a criticism that probably was bothering 
them a good deal columbia university securities law professor 
john c coffee jr said the idea that this was a witch hunt 
tends to fade pretty quickly when the witch pleads guilty 
milken supporters maintained he was persecuted because of the 
enormous power he wielded over the nations financial markets from 
his xshaped trading desk at drexels beverly hills calif office 
nevertheless milken pleaded guilty before us district judge 
kimba wood to conspiracy securities fraud mail fraud helping 
others violate federal securities regulations and assisting in the 
filing of a false tax return 
he broke down as he read an 11page statement detailing the 
charges and apologizing for his actions his voice cracked as he 
admitted he was guilty your honor 
the charges included illegal stock parking arrangements with 
boesky involving the 1984 takeover target fishbach corp stock 
manipulation in mca corp in 1985 illegal trading with client 
david solomon in 1985 and 1986 and illegally helping solomon skirt 
tax laws 
a constant in the deals was that milken promised illegal quid 
pro quos apparently to help clients or drexel turn a profit 
still the charges were lighter than the most serious 
allegations in the 98count indictment handed up in march 1989 
the charges are a far cry from the lurid irresponsible and 
prejudicial accusations against michael that have been made by 
anonymous sources to the press for the past 3 years milken 
attorney arthur liman said 
the charges do not involve racketeering or insider trading 
nor do they reflect the fundamentals of the junk bond market he 
said they involve instances in which michael went too far in 
helping clients which is not to minimize the plea 
milken emphasized that junk bonds werent involved in the 
charges telling the court his plea was an admission of personal 
responsibility and not a reflection of the underlying soundness 
and integrity of the capital markets in which we specialized 
the plea deal bars milken from the securities industry forever 
and requires him to assist the continuing investigations related to 
the insider trading scandal the government dropped all charges 
against milkens brother lowell 
milken widely is regarded as the most important american 
financier since jp morgan jr in the early 1900s he came to 
symbolize the bounty and excesses of a booming wall street and 
amassed a personal fortune that is believed to exceed 1 billion 
he pioneered the use of highyield debt securities known as junk 
bonds giving small companies access to billions of dollars in 
capital and making possible the wave of hostile corporate takeovers 
that characterized the dogeatdog 1980s 
his downfall began after he was linked to an insider trading 
network by boesky who received a threeyear prison term and was 
fined 100 million in november 1986 to settle his own case 
boesky also led prosecutors to stockbroker boyd jefferies gaf 
corp executive james sherwin speculator sandy lewis and 
arbitrager robert freeman but they received prison terms of only 
three to six months or just probation 
milken vigorously maintained his innocence after he was 
indicted saying he planned to fight the charges at trial he 
reversed course last week and agreed to the plea bargain avoiding 
a long courtroom confrontation and the prospect of a much stiffer 
prison term 
under the settlement which also resolves civil charges milken 
will pay 200 million in fines and place 400 million in a 
securities and exchange commission account to compensate defrauded 
investors he still can be sued by private investors however 
the milken plea comes just two months after drexel began 
liquidating when its parent company filed for bankruptcy 
protection drexel itself pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed 
to pay 650 million to settle related charges

i am here today because in connection with some transactions 
i transgressed certain of the laws and regulations that govern our 
industry i was wrong in doing so and knew that at the time and i 
am pleading guilty to these offenses 
on his relationship with disgraced stock speculator ivan boesky 
who led federal investigators to milken 
we were not social friends and had little in common the 
relationship started as an armslength and correct one

sales of north americanmade cars and trucks 
tumbled 177 percent in midapril indicating that incentives 
arent drawing the crowds like they did a year ago 
its just a lot tougher fight said alan helfman general 
manager of river oaks chryslerplymouth in houston 
part of the fight helfman and other dealers are facing is coming 
from vehicles made in the united states by japanese companies the 
socalled transplants 
sales of cars and trucks made by general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp were down 205 percent during 
midapril while sales of transplant vehicles rose 236 percent 
the 10 major us car and truck makers reported selling an 
average of 34071 vehicles a day during the april 1120 period this 
year compared with a daily average of 41380 last year 
car sales were down 191 percent and truck sales were off 151 
percent 
for the year to date domestic car and truck sales were down 35 
percent with car sales falling 43 percent and truck sales 
dropping 2 percent 
auto analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors services inc 
in new york said it was tough to gauge the demand for new cars and 
trucks 
i dont see much of a pattern she said its very jumpy 
automakers have relied on incentives to increase otherwise slow 
showroom traffic but helfman said sales have tapered off this 
month compared with march despite the continued presence of 
incentives 
im not losing any sales he said im not getting them 
either 
chrysler took the hardest beating of the big three as its 
combined car and truck sales fell 362 percent once again as it 
has in other recent 10day reporting periods chryslers trucks 
outsold its cars this time 20393 to 18692 
i think they chrysler executives are trying to figure out 
where the imperial the new yorker and the landau are helfman 
said of the companys luxury cars were selling some of each 
but not to any great magnitude 
gm and ford posted significant but less drastic declines in 
their midapril sales sales of gm cars and trucks were down 159 
percent during the period and ford sales were off 19 percent 
the midapril period of 1989 was among the strongest of last 
year in late march and early april last year the big three 
sweetened their incentive packages by offering bigger cash rebates 
and slashing interest rates 
as it did last year chrysler this month offered interestfree 
financing on twoyear loans for some of its jeeps and cars and 
reduced financing rates on longerterm loans it was too early on 
tuesday to tell if the new incentive program was having an effect 
on the companys sales 
chryslers car sales during midapril fell 384 percent compared 
with a year ago and truck sales were down 339 percent 
sales of gm cars were down 189 percent and its truck sales fell 
96 percent fords car sales were down 227 percent and truck 
sales dropped 131 percent in midapril

a new study says the nations mortgage 
lenders are requiring homeowners to keep billions of dollars of 
excess funds in escrow accounts to fatten the lenders profits 
many of the nations mortgage lenders systematically have 
broken the law says the report compiled by attorneys general 
from seven states and released tuesday 
they said the violations have been taking place for more than a 
decade and called on federal officials to tighten enforcement of 
laws limiting the amount lenders can set aside in escrow accounts 
our study concludes we need a national solution to this 
problem said iowa attorney general tom miller one of those 
sponsoring the report we must have change throughout the 
industry so we dont penalize individual companies or individual 
states who insist on legal escrow cushions 
the study estimates that the average amount of excess escrow 
could be as much as 150 for every mortgage which would amount to 
several billion dollars nationwide the report says it is routine 
for lenders to hold more than twice as much as the law allows in 
escrow accounts 
a spokesman for one bank cited in the study denied any 
wrongdoing 
escrow accounts are kept by lending institutions to make 
payments for property taxes insurance and other items which 
borrowers must pay 
extra money in escrow accounts hurts consumers and is a bonanza 
for lenders because they get to use the money for free or pay only 
a very low rate of interest on the funds 
about twothirds of the nations home mortgages involve escrow 
accounts in many cases lenders ignore the contracts they sign with 
consumers when they make loans the report said 
thus the total dollar amount overescrowed is likely to be 
even larger than the states analysis the report says 
federal law limits lenders to keeping a twomonth cushion in 
escrow or enough money to make payments for two months the 
cushion allows lenders to make tax and insurance payments even if 
the consumer is late making a monthly payment 
right now cushions sometimes amount to three to five months 
of the annual tax and insurance bills and thats not fair to 
consumers miller said the excessive cushion cant be 
justified as protecting the lenders investment it simply gives 
them more of the consumers money to earn bigger profits 
the report called on housing and urban development secretary 
jack kemp to tighten enforcement of the law 
hud has the power to end these industrywide violations once 
and for all the officials said in a letter to kemp 
the study was conducted by attorneys general in iowa 
california florida massachusetts minnesota new york and texas 
the attorneys general have complained to kemp about the issue since 
1988 
this important issue involving billions of consumer dollars 
remains in administrative limbo the report concluded 
the twoyear study focused on big lenders who operate 
nationwide a survey of four of the largest citibank gmac 
mortgage corp fleet mortgage corp and lomas financial group 
indicated that lenders may be holding excessive and illegal 
cushions in more than 70 percent of escrow accounts 
susan weeks vice president of public affairs for citicorp 
parent of citibank said the new yorkbased company was a little 
surprised by the announcement 
she said citicorp has been working with new york attorney 
general robert abrams for more than a year on the matter weve 
explained to him were in compliance she said 
she said the law allows the bank to hold funds in escrow to pay 
for expenses on the account and permits a twomonth cushion on top 
of that 
if there is anything in excess of that we automatically 
return it to the consumer and then we recalculate what that escrow 
payment should be each month she said

fisherprices illfated attempt to broaden its 
line of toys is a textbook case of how a company can get into 
trouble by ignoring its basic business in a drive to expand 
analysts say 
fisherprices troubles became too much for quaker oats co the 
food company said tuesday it would spin off its toy division to 
shareholders 
quaker also reported a 60 percent drop in its fiscal third 
quarter net income the results included a 25 million operating 
loss at fisherprice 
consumers long have associated the fisherprice name with 
sturdy simple imaginative toys for preschoolers 
but the companys attempts to transfer that name recognition to 
toys aimed at older children did not work out well said john g 
taylor who follows the toy industry for lh alton amp co a san 
francisco brokerage 
they took their eye off their basic business taylor said 
that enabled hasbros playskool division rubbermaids little tikes 
division and mattels disneycharacter toys to make inroads into 
fisherprices traditional market 
fisherprices electronic car and electronic guitar two 
products introduced in 1989 reportedly hit production snags that 
delayed shipments to stores in the critical months before 
christmas hurting their sales 
and in the hitdriven toy industry a pricey product that fails 
to live up to expectations can have severe repercussions 
if you lose your focus on your staple predictable product 
line you can get into real trouble if your hit toys turn out to be 
not such big hits after all said analyst carol i palmer at duff 
amp phelps inc in chicago 
fisherprice remains the worlds largest maker of infant and 
preschool toys such as the pullatune xylophone and the little 
people farm 
but fierce competition and its costly attempts to expand have 
cost it millions of dollars and precious market share points 
still taylor said the company has a potent name 
people will say im going to buy a fisherprice toy he 
said thats a unique kind of thing to have 
if they can focus on reinforcing that reputation for quality 
and play value that theyve had in the past they ought to be able 
to get back on track 
quaker chairman william d smithburg said fisherprice should 
fare better as an independent publicly owned company 
in the long term a fisherprice which is not part of a larger 
company should be a more focused organization which should enhance 
its competitiveness and facilitate the attraction retention and 
motivation of its management and employees smithburg said in a 
statement 
quakers stock rose 62 cents to 4925 a share tuesday in 
composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
chicagobased quaker had been rumored for several months to be 
considering selling fisherprice which posted an 11 percent 
decline in operating income in fiscal 1989 and last month closed a 
manufacturing plant in its headquarters city of east aurora ny 
quaker spokesman ronald bottrell said the company had received 
some unsolicited expressions of interest in fisherprice but 
ultimately decided a spinoff would provide the greatest value to 
shareholders 
pending approval by the internal revenue service quaker said it 
expects to complete a taxfree distribution of fisherprice stock 
to quaker shareholders by the first quarter of 1991 
the new companys board will elect its own chief executive 
quaker said paul e price fisherprices interim president and 
chief operating officer will return to his responsibilities as 
quakers chief financial officer 
founded 60 years ago fisherprice was acquired by quaker in 
1969 and saw its sales grow from 32 million to 800 million during 
the past 20 years it employs about 7400 people worldwide 
price said in february that fisherprices market share in young 
childrens toys had dropped in 1989 to the high 8 percent range 
from 10 percent 
bottrell said fisherprice had an operating loss of about 25 
million including 107 million in plantclosing costs for the 
three months ending march 31 compared with income of 92 million 
in the third quarter of 1989 
quakers overall net income fell to 256 million or 32 cents a 
share from 641 million or 81 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue rose 5 percent to 13 billion from 12 billion

president bush is dismissing a prediction that 
his proposed cutbacks in farm program payments would cause a 
financial crisis in agriculture 
the president reacted tuesday to concerns raised by sen bob 
kerrey dneb who wants the senate agriculture committee to 
approve price supports of 12 billion a year for five years under 
the 1990 farm bill 
kerrey said farm economy has improved considerably since the 
early 1980s 
however he told a meeting of the national association of 
agricultural journalists if you dont provide this level of 
funding in two years you are going to see this recovery vanish 
there are many things i respect about senator kerrey said 
bush told the same group later in the day sometimes we have a 
philosophical difference of opinion i have a different view on 
this 
bush is seeking 102 billion in price supports for fiscal 1991 
which begins oct 1 his proposals envision further cuts in 
government support over the years and more prosperity for farmers 
in the open market 
but kerrey said failed farming operations brought on by 
insufficient government support would cost more taxpayer money in 
the long run than the annual 12 billion he is advocating 
the crops protected by the government subsidies are the big 
money crops wheat corn cotton soybeans and rice 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who appeared with bush 
said farm income need not be dependent on the government 
theres a market out there said yeutter all of us are 
concerned about farm income 
yeutter and kerrey both nebraskans have been wrangling for 
months over how much government support should be provided to 
farmers 
the agriculture secretary said he could not predict support 
payments for the remaining four years of the farm bill because 
international trade talks known as the uruguay round of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt are not yet 
complete 
the administration has been working through gatt to open the 
international marketplace by removing subsidies which yeutter and 
other officials say distort prices 
rep richard armey rtexas who also spoke to the agricultural 
journalists said he would like to see government out of the farm 
business altogether 
he said he is putting together a coalition in congress to oppose 
the support programs being devised by the agriculture committees 
when the bill gets to the floor

britains merchandise trade deficit soared in 
march to 36 billion the secondworst gap on record the 
government reported wednesday 
the widening from 23 billion in february sent the pound 
plummeting and prompted the bank of england to intervene to support 
the british currency 
the government blamed the shortfall largely on higher imports of 
oil and of erratic items such as civil aircraft and precious 
metals imports hit a record during the latest month 
the pound fell to 16265 by about noon local time from 16345 
just before the trade report was released 
the bank of england intervened to support the pound by selling 
dollars sources familiar with the intervention said the bank of 
england declined to comment on the reported intervention as is its 
practice 
it was pretty disastrous numbers said jeff earnshaw deputy 
head of foreign exchange trading at natwest moneycenter he said 
the bad trade news could easily spark a prolonged slide in sterling 
a treasury spokesman who wasnt identified in accordance with 
british practice said the deterioration is almost entirely the 
result of higher imports not lower exports 
but dealers said the news could seriously shake the financial 
markets recent confidence that the countrys trade position was 
improving 
the current account deficit also soared to 36 billion from 
23 billion the central statistical office said 
the current account deficit equals the merchandise trade deficit 
plus socalled invisible trade such as services overseas 
investment earnings and official transfer payments 
the markets had expected deficits of 22 billion 
the statistical office said the deficits were the second worse 
on record after a 39 billion merchandise trade gap and a 38 
billion current account shortfall in august 1989 
exports totaled 136 billion in march down from 137 billion 
in february imports totaled a record 172 billion in march up 
from 16 billion 
since the beginning of the year the merchandise trade deficit 
has grown to 91 billion compared with a shortfall of 98 
billion a year earlier

michael milkens switch from defiant defendant 
to humble felon has aroused responses ranging from sympathy to 
scorn to skepticism over whether justice was served in the 
billionaire financiers plea bargain 
following milkens tearful admission of guilt tuesday defense 
lawyers and friends said they understood the pressure he faced in 
capitulating to a government deadline to cooperate or face a more 
devastating prosecution on charges of racketeering 
i cant in my memory think of an individual who has been so 
hammered through leaks through allegations through innuendo 
without having the opportunity to stand up said attorney ira l 
sorkin a former securities and exchange commission administrator 
now in private practice 
milkens former employer drexel burnham lambert also tainted by 
wall street scandal and now in a bankruptcycourt supervised 
liquidation expressed sympathy for the man who once made drexel a 
powerful investment firm 
michael milken was highly esteemed for his contributions in 
creating a new capital market and todays events are a tragedy for 
him his family and for those who were associated with him 
drexel said in a statement 
but others said milkens guilty plea amounts to a wristslap for 
enormous criminality and means the public may never know the true 
extent of possible wrongdoing particularly in junk bonds the 
highyield highrisk securities on which milken and drexel built 
their fortunes 
milken admitted guilt to six counts of breaking securities and 
tax laws for which he faces a maximum 28 year prison term and must 
pay 600 million in fines and restitution that still will leave 
him enormously wealthy 
the governments agreement with mr milken raises more 
questions than it answers said rep john dingell dmich 
chairman of the house energy and commerce committee who monitors 
the securities industry and has frequently criticized its alleged 
transgressors 
the fines assessed amount to less than a years compensation 
for mr milken according to the most conserviative estimates 
dingell said ironically the man known as the junkbond king was 
not charged with any violations with respect to his junk bond 
transactions 
the plea capped an ordeal that had dogged milken and drexel 
since stock speculator ivan f boesky began feeding incriminating 
information about them to authorities in 1986 
despite milkens cathartic admission that he was a felon some 
said his apology masked the reasons he violated the law in the 
first place and insisted for more than three years that he was 
innocent 
milken was clearly a genius who achieved a lot on the 
merits said thomas dunfee ethics professor at the prestigious 
wharton school where milken earned an mba degree why he 
couldnt stop is a mystery to me why didnt playing by the rules 
provide enough satisfaction if we can get an answer to that it 
would help us to better understand attitudes about the law 
others argued that milken still believes he was innocent but was 
bludgeoned into confessing by prosecutors who abused the 
racketeering law which shaped the original 98count indictment 
against him 
ive always thought that to put racketeering counts on 
businessmen for money crimes was a misuse of the law said james 
linn a prominent attorney who has represented other defendants in 
the wall street scandal i think its always wrong to use that as 
a threat to hang over a defendants head to make him take some 
lesser counts 
some said the relatively few charges in the plea agreement did 
not mean the government had let milken off easily many believe 
milken will have to do some prison time 
its silly to play the game of who got the better deal said 
sorkin the fact of the matter is mr milken is a convicted 
felon federal prison minimum or maximum is not a very pleasant 
place 
others said the government benefited enormously from milkens 
plea because it will eliminate a costly trial that could take years 
pleading guilty to six counts is really quite serious said 
arthur miller a harvard law professor the truth is he is guilty 
and he will have to carry that stigma for the rest of his life 
on wall street where the boeskydrexelmilken scandal has 
become folklore news of milkens guilty plea provoked little 
sympathy many securities industry workers believe the scandal 
played a role in eroding the public appetite for stocks in recent 
years 
john eric smith a brokerage official at the new york stock 
exchange said the milken case was like a cleansing process that 
should restore investor confidence if youre caught doing 
something wrong youve got to pay for it he said

koito manufacturing co which has been resisting 
advances by t boone pickens jr announced wednesday it has raised 
its dividend following a demand from the texas oilman 
the auto parts maker said it would add an extra 2 yen the 
equivalent of 1 cent to its regular dividend of 8 yen a share for 
the fiscal year that ended march 31 koito initially had rejected 
pickens demand for a larger dividend 
pickens became the largest stockholder in the company last year 
after buying a large holding from kitaro watanabe the owner of 
azabu motors and other japanese companies 
japans finance ministry has ruled watanabe violated securities 
regulations by buying and reselling his shares to pickens in too 
short a period and ordered him to pay koito the 11 billion yen 
or 69 million he reportedly made in the transaction 
in his demand last september for increasing dividend payments by 
3 yen a share pickens said the money received by the company from 
watanabe should be distributed to its shareholders 
koito management has viewed pickens stock purchases as 
threatening and has refused his demands for a seat on its board 
and a chance to review its books 
the company has expressed concern that pickens would return a 
portion of his extra dividend to watanabe who it said twice 
sought to greenmail koito with the shares he later transferred to 
mr pickens 
greenmail is the practice of buying up stock in a company and 
forcing the company or a friendly affiliate to buy back the shares 
at a higher price 
pickens later pledged in a letter to koito that none of the 
increased dividends would be channeled back to watanabe 
a koito official said the decision to increase the dividend 
had some connection with pickens demand 
but the decision wasnt based only on that he said the 
committee after studying the issue decided that it was 
appropriate to distribute the money among all the stockholders 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said koito 
remained concerned that a portion of pickens share might go to 
watanabe but we want to believe in his promise 
pickens now holds 264 percent of the companys stock or nearly 
424 million shares up from 324 million shares a year ago the 
official said 
pickens has testified in the us congress that his failure to 
win management rights in koito shows that japan is closed to us 
investors but koito officials say they are reluctant to give him 
management power because of his reputation as a corporate raider 
pickens earlier this month also asked japans fair trade 
commission to investigate what he said were violations of the 
antimonopoly law resulting from the close relations between 
japanese automakers and parts suppliers commission officials said 
they would study his claims and decide what action to take 
toyota motor corp is the secondlargest stockholder in koito 
with about 19 percent of the companys shares

a group of eastern airlines pilots is forming a 
new union to unseat the air line pilots association as its 
bargaining agent and prevent alpa from reclaiming jobs held by 
replacement pilots since the eastern strike 
our statement t o alpa is you dont represent us anymore 
said steve glasgow a veteran atlantabased pilot who is among the 
organizers of the union eastern pilots association 
the group must get approval from 50 percent of eligible pilots 
the national mediation board then must certify the results and 
oversee formal voting 
a majority vote would end alpas presence at the troubled 
airline and give the new union negotiating power 
many of the new unions organizers never joined the march 1989 
pilots walkout and have renounced their alpa memberships they are 
joined by replacement pilots worried that their jobs could be 
sacrificed in any new agreement between alpa and courtappointed 
eastern trustee martin r shugrue jr who has talked of achieving 
labor peace 
tom cooper a 28year eastern veteran and temporary chairman of 
the new union said about 100 pilots attended recent organizational 
meetings in miami he said the group plans to spend about 200000 
on the organizing effort and will hire a law firm to help 
eastern spokesman robin matell declined comment 
ej breen a spokesman for alpas eastern members called the 
movement counterproductive and hinted at legal challenges 
the enemy has been frank lorenzo he said referring to the 
texas air corp chairman whose control of eastern was given to 
shugrue by a bankruptcy judge 
now it looks like some selfserving individuals on the inside 
want to start a new war breen said 
eastern has about 1800 working pilots about half crossed 
picket lines or refused to honor the strike and half are 
replacement hires

florida has ordered aerial pesticide spraying to 
protect the states 14 billion citrus industry from an 
infestation of medflies 
spraying of malathion has worked in past infestations of the 
mediterranean fruit fly and theres no reason to change methods now 
and run into the grave risk of getting into the predicament 
california is in state agriculture commissioner doyle conner 
said tuesday 
in southern california aerial spraying of malathion in suburban 
neighborhoods has caused an uproar while the pest has spread into 
orange and grapefruit groves in some of the regions richest 
farmland 
and while expanded spraying over a 52squaremile area of los 
angeles and san bernardino counties was ordered tuesday scientists 
admitted that malathion spraying there may be a failing strategy 
its clear that were not doing the job with the current 
approach said jim carey an entomology professor at the 
university of california davis and member of the state medfly 
science advisory board the medfly infestation is bordering on 
being out of control if not out of control 
the first florida spraying against medflies begins thursday in a 
16squaremile zone covering areas northwest of downtown miami and 
near miami international airport thats where six of the pests 
have been found since april 16 
three other sprayings will follow over the next several weeks 
after four weeks millions of sterile medflies will be released to 
break the breeding cycle 
the last medfly infestation in south florida was in 1987 when 
five males were found the states last major outbreak affecting 
commercial groves spread across 28 counties in 1956 
environmentalists in california and here have objected to use of 
malathion contending too little is known about the chemicals 
longterm health effects 
the bad thing about using these kinds of chemicals is that 
they wipe out all of the insects in an area the good and the 
bad said lee emerson a member of the sierra club its not 
the kind of balanced environmentally sensitive approach we should 
be taking these days 
joette lorion a miami coordinator of earth day said if its 
a danger to your car and theyre asking you to wipe it off it must 
be a danger to your body 
the mixture of malathion and syrupy bait can damage car paint if 
not rinsed off quickly 
officials also said that people with health problems such as 
asthma or allergies may want to remain indoors during the 
spraying but conner said of malathion it has not been 
determined anywhere to be a health risk 
medflies could strike a harsh blow to floridas citrus industry 
which was crippled by a christmas freeze medfly larvae hatch 
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables turning 
them into mush 
bobby mckown executive vice president of florida citrus mutual 
in lakeland said monday the 12000member growers organization 
supports immediate action to control and eradicate the medflies 
so they dont expand beyond residential areas 
the pesticide to be sprayed per acre consists of 24 ounces of 
malathion mixed with sticky bait malathion is used in a stronger 
concentration of 31 ounces per acre throughout florida for 
mosquito control

cray research inc reported sharply higher 
firstquarter earnings and repeated earlier statements that it 
expects its profit for all of 1990 to increase 
net income for the first three months of 1990 totaled 95 
million or 33 cents a share compared with earnings of 15 
million or 5 cents a share in 1989s first quarter the 
minneapolisbased supercomputer maker said tuesday 
revenue for the first quarter totaled 1359 million up 17 
percent from 1161 million in the same period of 1989 
we continue to hold the view that revenue will be flat in 1990 
but earnings will improve over last year said marcelo gumucio 
president and chief operating officer 
last year cray earned 89 million on revenue of 785 million 
cray results typically vary a great deal from quarter to quarter 
onequarter snapshots of crays numbers are not particularly 
meaningful said gary smaby an analyst with the 
minneapolisbased smaby group 
but smaby said the 17 percent revenue increase in the first 
quarter does take pressure off the companys usually strong fourth 
quarter 
cray reported signing orders worth 80 million during the first 
quarter down from 100 million during 1989s first quarter

norton co which has been fending off a hostile 
takeover bid from british conglomerate btr plc said today it 
agreed to be acquired by the french firm compagnie saintgobain in 
a deal that values the abrasives manufacturer at around 18 
billion 
the 90ashare cash offer exceeds btrs bid of 16 billion or 
75 a share which was rejected last month by nortons board of 
directors 
wall street applauded todays announcement in active trading on 
the new york stock exchange norton jumped 1350 to 8875 a share 
by midday 
the announced merger with compagnie saintgobain comes a day 
after a federal judge ordered worcesterbased norton to reveal the 
amount of a white knight offer it said it had received last 
week 
the court order came during a hearing on suits filed on behalf 
of some norton shareholders seeking to require norton to fully and 
fairly consider btrs offer and take into consideration the 
interest of the shareholders 
norton told the securities and exchange commission last friday 
that a third party was interested in buying norton for more money 
btr had planned to wage a proxy fight at nortons annual 
shareholders meeting set for thursday 
but one of nortons biggest weapons was a new state law that 
would prevent btr from taking immediate control over the norton 
board the law zoomed through the legislature last week and was 
signed by gov michael s dukakis taking effect immediately it 
permits a massachusetts corporation to elect only onethird of its 
directors at a time unless the company opts out of the requirement 
btr had said it wouldnt back down despite the state law 
in a statement chairman john s nelson said norton has 
fought hard to remain independent because we believed this to be 
the ideal for all norton constituencies 
but nelson said a negotiated merger was the best alternative 
to a btr bid which he termed as inadequate 
norton and saintgobain said the merger was conditioned upon 
keeping nortons headquaters and principal manufacturing operations 
in worcester 
the companies said norton would continue operating under the 
same name and that employee policies and benefits would be 
continued at present levels 
norton also would remain an autonomous company with a separate 
board of directors they said 
these are the commitments on which we have formed our 
partnership and the merger agreement provides specifically that 
these commitments will continue for at least five years nelson 
and saintgobain chairman jeanlouis beffa said in a joint 
statement 
according to a statement at least twothirds of nortons 2037 
million common shares outstanding must be tendered before the full 
financed cash offer beginning april 30 1990 
norton is the worlds largest manufacturer of abrasives and a 
leading producer of engineering materials including advanced 
ceramics performance plastics and chemical process products 
norton which had 1989 sales of approximately 15 billion employs 
16000 people and operates 113 plans in the united states and 25 
other countries 
saintgobain produces a variety of flat glass fiber glass 
piping paper and wood products and has annual sales of more than 
11 billion the parisbased company employees 88000 people and 
operate 350 plants in the united states and 20 other countries

the dollar finished mostly lower in european 
trading wednesday as support for the west german mark firmed 
gold was lower 
dealers said market activity was generally focused on crossrate 
movements between the mark and other currencies particularly the 
british pound and the japanese yen 
its as much a switch back into marks as any other factor 
said michael james head of interbank dealing for britains 
midland bank 
the dollar held relatively firm against the yen largely on the 
japanese units weakness rather than any substantive move in the 
dollar 
but some dealers suggested firmer longterm us interest rates 
helped the dollar by at least creating perceptions that japanese 
investment capital would flow toward the dollar 
late in london the dollar was quoted at 16820 marks down from 
16930 marks late tuesday 
in tokyo the dollar rose 110 yen to a closing 15925 yen in 
london it was quoted late wednesday at 15859 yen 
the pound sank following the british announcement of a 
merchandise trade deficit of 218 billion pounds in march wider 
than 139 billion pounds a month earlier the bank of england 
stepped in to signal support at around 16260 
sterling finished the day slightly stronger against the dollar 
trading at 16370 late wednesday compared to 16345 tuesday 
other late rates compared with late tuesdays levels were 
14665 swiss francs down from 14865 56455 french francs down 
from 56795 18970 dutch guilders down from 19100 123400

an environmentalist group briefly disrupted the 
exxon corp annual meeting today while executives told shareholders 
the alaskan shore slimed with oil from the exxon valdez should be 
cleaned by summers end 
very substantial progress has obviously been made exxon 
president lee r raymond said in detailing the cleanup of the worst 
oil spill in us history now a rallying cry for the environmental 
movement 
raymond cited a massive summerlong effort last year the 
scouring of winter storms and the application last fall of a 
fertilizer to speed the biological decay of the oil 
in contrast with the roughly 250 demonstrators who attended last 
years annual meeting in new jersey about 20 people outside 
todays gathering carried signs urging a boycott of exxon products 
but later inside while exxon executives spoke they were 
interrupted when jay hair president of the national wildlife 
federation took issue with the upbeat review of exxons alaska 
operations 
we call that bull he said suggesting the damage goes 
beyond the environment listen to the people of alaska whose 
lives have been destroyed and youre putting the profits in your 
pockets hair said to loud boos from the audience 
exxon has come under harsh criticism from environmentalists 
politicians and many shareholders for what was perceived as its 
inadequate response to the alaska disaster the worst oil spill in 
us history 
the meeting agenda was dominated by the 11 milliongallon spill 
which occurred march 24 1989 when the tanker exxon valdez hit a 
reef shareholders were scheduled to vote on six environmentally 
related resolutions 
some environmental groups also have called informally for 
chairman lawrence g rawl to resign although he is not expected to 
do so 
demonstrators handed out leaflets suggesting 10 questions 
shareholders should ask exxon management about its response to the 
oil spill and other problems 
once inside the george r brown convention center shareholders 
passed through metal detectors and then passed through an elaborate 
display called progress in alaska detailing exxons cleanup 
efforts in prince william sound 
some of the criticism against exxon has been over its decision 
to reduce activity last september in preparation for alaskas harsh 
winter one display told shareholders that nature takes over the 
cleaning job with intense storm activity during the fall winter 
and spring 
exxon executives said the company will resume fullscale cleanup 
within a few weeks after a survey is completed of remaining damage 
spokesman henry w beathard estimated the job would be finished by 
the end of summer 
rawl and raymond each touted exxons environmental efforts 
during remarks opening the meeting attended by more than 1000 
shareholders 
in addition to reaffirming our own commitment to safety and 
environmental protection exxon has been an active participant in 
the development of guiding principles for the petroleum and 
chemical industries rawl said 
the company had spent some 2 billion for spillrelated expenses 
through the end of 1989 and faces possible further costs for civil 
and criminal damages linked to the disaster and other oil spills 
the environmentrelated shareholder resolutions include pledges 
by exxon to reduce its emissions of pollutants and toxic waste 
create a special environmental affairs committee on its board of 
directors and follow the socalled valdez principles for corporate 
environmental conduct 
exxon says all the resolutions are duplicative and unnecessary 
and should be rejected by shareholders 
also today exxon said it would join other oil companies in 
reformulating some of its gasolines to burn cleaner exxon said it 
would market its gasolines in 40 markets in the east and along the 
gulf coast exxon will sell the reformulated gasoline in the new 
york area yearround and in other areas during the summer

existing home sales in march remained below 
1989 levels for the second straight month as mortgage interest 
rates stayed in the doubledigits a real estate trade group 
reported wednesday 
the national association of realtors said resales of 
singlefamily homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 340 million 
units unchanged from the number of sales in february but down from 
the 352 million rate in january 
the annual rate for a particular month represents what the total 
number of sales for the year would be if the pace were maintained 
for 12 consecutive months during all of 1989 actual sales totaled 
344 million units 
realtors chief economist john a tuccillo said the 340 million 
pace the slowest since a 338 million rate last july was 
sustainable for the rest of the year 
the commerce department is scheduled to report new home sales 
for march next monday new home sales rose 31 percent to an annual 
rate of 607000 units in february after plunging 68 percent the 
previous month 
but the pace of sales remained below the 649000 new homes sold 
in 1989 and analysts placed the blame on mortgage rates and 
declining consumer confidence 
the federal home loan mortgage corp reported that 30year 
conventional fixedrate mortgages averaged between 1022 percent 
and 1034 percent during march high when compared to the 
singledigit rates at the end of 1989 
the realtors said the high rates had a dual effect on the 
existing home market consumer uncertainty triggered purchases by 
prospective buyers fearing higher rates in the future while it 
curbed sales by others hoping for lower rates in the months ahead 
the ratewatchers who are making their move now tend to be in 
less expensive markets said realtors president norman d flynn 
those who are holding back in hopes of rate declines tend to be 
in the higherpriced markets 
the realtors said the national median price of existing homes 
was 96100 in march up 900 from february the median price of a 
new home in february was 130000 according to the commerce 
department the median means that half of the homes cost more half 
less 
existing home sales in the northeast continued to be sluggish in 
march falling 169 percent to an annual rate of 490000 units the 
median price there was 148200 up 33 percent from the previous 
month 
sales also fell in the west down 15 percent to an annual rate 
of 640000 the median price was 143300 the same as februarys 
sales were unchanged at an annual rate of 890000 units in the 
midwest where the median price was 72900 down 16 percent 
the south posted the only sales gain up 38 percent to 136 
million units the median price was up 09 percent to 86000

capitol hill is aflutter and abuzz with 
lobbying campaigns by friends of the monarch butterfly and the 
honeybee 
advocates of each critter say the united states is long past due 
for a national insect there is a national bird the bald eagle so 
lets have a national bug they say 
so far the house and senate have not been pushed into deciding 
but the entomological society of america which observed its 100th 
year in 1989 is working on behalf of the monarch butterfly 
rep leon panetta dcalif has introduced a butterfly bill in 
the house and has added 16 cosponsors but rep stephen l neal 
dnc has a honeybee measure waiting that has 38 cosponsors 
in the senate no champion of the butterfly has stepped forth 
says douglas ws sutherland chairman of the societys national 
insect subcommittee 
were looking but so far we havent had any luck 
sutherland said tuesday 
sen larry pressler rsd has a honeybee bill and a number of 
cosponsors pressler and others point to the honeybees valuable 
contributions to agriculture as a crop pollinator as well as a 
provider of honey 
thats the story in the house too where john taylor an aide 
to neal said their bill would recognize the importance of 
beekeepers and bees as an integral part of us agriculture 
i think the strength of our bill is that the bee is such a 
big part of agriculture taylor said the bee pollinates the 
food that you and i eat 
according to the agriculture department us honeybees produce 
about 250 million pounds of honey and unintentionally pollinate 
more than 90 cultivated crops with a combined annual value of 
billions of dollars 
sutherland an entomologist for the environmental protection 
agency said tuesday that he recognized the honeybees important 
role in agriculture but thinks the monarch deserves the national 
title 
the societys membership of about 2000 voted on which insect to 
support and the familiar orangeandblack monarch came out on top 
followed by the tiger swallowtail butterfly a large yellow 
species 
sutherland said the convergent lady beetle was third among the 
societys members and the honeybee was fourth overall he said 
the two butterflies received more than 70 percent of the vote 
the monarchs appeal partly stems from its wide range over the 
united states he said the swallowtail on the other hand is not 
found in all states 
sutherland said the monarch is a benign native american 
creature that feeds on milkweed and harms no one eastern varieties 
migrate to an area in the mountains southwest of mexico city while 
the western monarchs flock to the california coast he said 
lobbying help for the monarch is forming among garden clubs 
many school children and others sutherland said 
a healthy environment for the monarch is a healthy environment 
for everybody basically he said

the senate agriculture committee has voted to 
extend current government programs for wool mohair and honey for 
five years with virtually no changes 
the wool and mohair title of the 1990 farm bill is 
essentially a fiveyear extension of the program for wool in the 
1985 farm bill sen patrick leahy dvt said tuesday 
the measure 
authorizes loans purchases and payments by the agriculture 
department to help the wool and mohair industry 
sets a payment rate that would be the difference between the 
national average of all domestic wool receipts and the price the 
government predetermined that producers should get each producers 
payment from the government would be calculated by applying this 
rate to net proceeds for wool sold the preceding year 
the honey section of the farm bill also would be little changed 
from current policies 
the price support for honey has dropped an average 5 percent 
each year for five years under the new legislation support prices 
would be frozen at 5686 cents a pound through 1995 
loan repayment rates would be unchanged

chicago ap sara lee corp reported a 146 percent increase 
in its fiscal thirdquarter net income wednesday despite a slight 
decline in overall sales and a poor performance from its namesake 
bakery division 
a company spokeswoman and an industry analyst both said the weak 
sales of sara lees packaged meats and bakery products partly 
reflected increased consumer preference for breakfast cereal 
people are eating cereal more than bacon and eggs and danish 
and bagels said analyst roger spencer of painewebber inc 
chicagobased sara lee reported net income of 1089 million or 
44 cents a share for the three months ended march 31 compared with 
95 million or 40 cents a share for the same period a year ago 
sales for the quarter fell 13 percent to 28 billion from 
284 billion reflecting both the disposition of some of sara 
lees foodservice businesses at the beginning of fiscal 1990 and a 
9 percent drop in bakery unit volume after a 10 percent increase in 
last years comparable quarter sara lee said in a statement 
unit volume refers to the amount of product shipped as opposed 
to revenue which refers to the dollars received from the sale of 
goods 
sales for sara lees packaged meats and bakery division fell 
135 percent to 12 billion and operating income for the unit 
plunged 25 percent to 452 billion 
the divisions poor performance was offset by a 2 percent sales 
increase and a 48 percent gain in operating income from the 
companys coffee and grocery division and by increases of 14 
percent in both sales and operating income for sara lees packaged 
consumer products division 
company spokeswoman anne mccarthy said bakery sales should 
improve with the planned introduction of new products in the second 
quarter she said sara lees recently introduced light baked 
goods have been successful 
for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 net income rose 14 
percent to 352 million or 140 per share from 3078 million 
or 132 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 1989 
sales for the three quarters totaled 865 billion compared with 
866 billion for the same period a year earlier

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade led by a surging 
soybean market amid bullish news surrounding developments in the 
soviet union 
traders heaved a collective sigh of relief that president 
bush had chosen not to impose economic sanctions against the soviet 
union in retaliation for moscows crackdown on lithuanian 
independence said joel karlin an analyst in chicago with research 
department inc a brokers advisory service 
some traders had feared the us would limit grain sales to the 
soviets 
rumors of soviet interest in soybean meal added further support 
as did perceptions that tuesdays steep drop in precious metal 
prices reflected soviet selling of gold to get hard currency for 
more grain and soybean purchases karlin said 
the census bureaus monthly report tuesday on the us soybean 
crush was also supportive it showed a largerthanexpected 1021 
million bushels of beans crushed in march to produce soybean oil 
and meal 
the report implied us soybean stocks may be declining more 
rapidly than the market had previously believed said william 
biedermann research director with the commodities brokerage 
allendale inc 
at the close wheat futures were unchanged to 3 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 371 a bushel corn 
futures were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with may at 279 a bushel

first quarterly loss after seven consecutive quarters in the black 
the airline said the loss of 26 million or 17 cents a share 
compared with net income of 101 million or 58 cents a share in

million gain from the sale of foreign tax benefits related to 
aircraft acquisition 
firstquarter revenue rose 308 percent to 3048 million from

the entire airline industry with disappointing results for the 
first quarter 1990 said al frei america wests chief financial 
officer america wests fuel expenses for the 1990 quarter 
increased approximately 9 million over the corresponding 1989 
quarter

anheuserbusch cos inc reported on wednesday 
record profits and sales in the first quarter of 1990 but still 
received a healthy dose of criticism at its annual meeting 
the worlds largest brewer said it earned 1825 million or 64 
cents a share in the latest quarter up 9 percent from 1671 
million or 58 cents a share for the same period in 1989 
sales were up 8 percent including a nearly 3 percent rise in 
barrels of beer sold in the quarter to 259 billion compared 
with 239 billion in 1989s first quarter 
despite the favorable report august busch iii chairman and 
president of the company spent much of his time at the annual 
meeting defending the company in both prepared remarks and answers 
to stockholders questions 
he defended the companys decision to cut its prices to match 
competitors prices a move that stock analysts said was 
anheuserbuschs attempt to speed up its effort to reach 50 percent 
market share by the mid1990s 
this does not mean we are trying to start a price war in the 
brewing industry busch said 
anheuserbusch increased its market share in 1989 to 42 percent 
of the market from about 40 percent in 1988 one out of every four 
beers sold in the united states is a budweiser according to the 
company 
the chairman also defended the anheuserbuschs efforts to 
prevent beer from being linked in any way to illegal drugs and 
praised the various programs the company sponsors to urge 
responsible beer drinking 
we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that beer 
plays a positive role in our society busch told the about 3200 
stockholders at the meeting 
the company was also criticized for flooding the market with too 
many brands 17 at last count and for spending too much money 
promoting already popular beers 
with three new products being launched this year already busch 
light bud dry and the nonalcoholic odouls busch agreed that 
our plates to say the least are full but he said theres no 
way around it 
proliferation of brands is somewhat disturbing to all of us 
if we had our druthers and we dont we would sell one product 
busch said but that isnt how the marketplace today works 
unless the company keeps coming up with new beers new packages 
new shelf space market share and profits will be lost busch said 
anheuserbusch which gets 80 percent of its revenues from beer 
and beerrelated sales also owns campbell taggart inc the second 
largest commercial baker in the country and the baseball team the 
st louis cardinals 
the company is also the countrys second largest themepark 
operator with busch gardens and sea world

horace saks and bernard gimbel who independently operated stores 
in new york city in the early part of this century the two 
merchants decided to open a fashionable specialty department store 
catering to affluent customers the store on fifth avenue opened 
sept 15 1924 
from 1924 to 1969 saks expanded and built a national 
recognition as an upscale retailer mainly of higher priced apparel 
bernard gimbels cousin adam became president after the 
sudden death of horace saks in 1926 under adam gimbel branch

opened by the end of 1990 
the flagship fifth avenue store was proclaimed a new york city 
landmark in 1965 
bat announced in september 1989 plans to sell saks its sister 
retailing operations plus certain other assets as part of a 
strategy to thwart an unsolicited takeover attempt by an investment 
group led by the anglofrench financier sir james goldsmith the

professional managers to run businesses he said in an interview 
that investcorp will meet with saks management as soon as possible 
to discuss the future he said no meeting had taken place yet 
because saks management had been competing in the auction

far from the boardroom battles between 
carl icahn and usx corp over the bottom line on steel the steel 
valley is bottoming out 
this towns mammoth mill forged the locks for the panama canal 
the girders for the golden gate bridge the beams for the empire 
state building the wheels for disneyland rides and the armor plate 
that crushed hitler and hirohito 
but after more than a century of steelmaking it was shuttered 
in 1986 as part of a corporate overhaul it is an icon of the 
smokestack age and a way of life extinct 
about 9000 people were employed here a decade ago wreckers 
toil at the homestead works now like scavengers picking innards of 
a carcass 
the last of five generations of steelworkers who witnessed the 
demolition talk caustically about wall street raiders and corporate 
revamping 
ninetynine out of 100 people who lost their jobs see it as 
the wrangling between two sharks who have already eaten them 
said mike stout 40 an exsteelworker who runs a printing shop 
they are extremely bitter they feel betrayed they want nothing 
to do with us steel ever again 
icahn usxs largest shareholder with 133 percent of its stock 
sees steel as a drain on the companys marathon oil co and texas 
oil and gas corp 
last year energy accounted for 65 percent of business for usx 
which changed its name from us steel four years ago and remains 
the nations largest steelmaker ten years ago steel was 70 
percent of sales 
icahn envisions a separate entity called us steel co of 
which 80 percent would be peddled to usx shareholders usx 
executives oppose the idea though they agreed to hold a nonbinding 
shareholder vote may 7 
but to the laborers who once felt the open hearth furnaces cook 
through their steeltoed shoes splitting the company would be a 
meaningless formality for them the furnaces are no longer an 
eternal flame 
people sort of accept it as fact that us steel is going to 
be chopped up said bob anderson a former steelworker who runs 
homesteads rainbow kitchen a food job and clothing bank 
theyve already dismembered the plants now theyre going to 
dismember the corporation anderson said it could be the final 
nail in the coffin the death of a way of life its not the steel 
valley anymore were an industrial graveyard 
as proof of changing times a fantasylike oasis has sprouted 
amid the ashes the sandcastle amusement park beckons visitors with 
water slides sandy beach and wooden boardwalk it adjoins the 
bankrupt mesta machine corp once the worlds largest maker of 
steelmaking equipment 
the region was called steel valley because hulking mills 
sprouted along the monongahela river south of pittsburgh the river 
network and direct access to coal fields made it an ideal place for 
steel basic metal of the 20th century 
the valley also was the backbone of us steel the worlds 
first billion dollar corporation some of capitalisms wealthiest 
barons forged the company out of a 1901 debtfinanced megadeal that 
was the biggest acquisition in history up to that point in todays 
dollars the 14 billion deal would be worth about 23 billion and 
would dwarf most of todays mergers 
the centerpiece was andrew carnegies mills in the steel valley 
which merged with seven other steel companies and john 
rockefellers iron mines through jp morgans financing 
the company prospered so did legions of slavs poles italians 
irish and german immigrant laborers drawing steady paychecks to 
raise families 
but the raw and brutal work had a price the whistles hisses 
rumbles the stench of sulphur eyesores of slag heaps rivers that 
ran like industrial sewers and air so dirty it blotted out the sun 
while street lights burned in the afternoon 
today renaissance pittsburgh is a corporate center with a 
gleaming skyline servicebased industry clean air and rivers 
rand mcnally rated it the nations most liveable place in 1986 and 
it is now ranked third 
but in steels heyday muckraking author lincoln steffens 
recoiled at the belching furnaces and called the area hell with 
the lid off 
when asked how the city could spruce itself up in the 1940s 
architect frank lloyd wright said abandon it 
back then us steel was more than just a job or a profitloss 
statement it was a paternal entity that dominated local politics 
determined land use paid most of the taxes and built libraries 
gyms and music halls 
the company and its predecessors also had their own security 
hired guns often battled union organizers in 1892 10 people were 
killed and scores injured when 300 armed pinkerton guards fired on 
strikers at carnegies homestead works 
us steel fused with all aspects of life even the sporting and 
spiritual its logo adorns the helmets of pittsburghs pro football 
team the steelers a stained glass window in a homestead church 
pictures steel being poured 
everybody in one way or another depended on us steel it was 
everybodys safety net said jo debolt director of the steel 
industry heritage task force which hopes to salvage part of the 
cadaver of homestead works as a museum 
imagine spending your whole life doing something youre proud 
of and all at once its gone people lost their sense of place if 
you live in the steel valley and you dont make steel anymore what 
are you mrs debolt said 
the safety net disintegrated in the 1980s failure to modernize 
sweetheart labor deals and imports contributed to the collapse 
steel valley became the symbolic capital of the rust bowl 
in 1979 26000 people worked for us steel in the valley 
today about 4000 toil at three remaining plants 
the only steelmaking plant is the edgar thomson works built in 
1875 as carnegies first mill he named it for the president of the 
pennsylvania railroad the biggest customer of carnegies rails 
the overhaul made usx leaner and meaner it takes less time and 
labor costs to make steel but it came with a social cost usx sold 
or closed 15 plants or mining operations in the past 10 years 
including homestead 
overall the region around steel valley lost 100000 
manufacturing jobs and 30 percent of its population workers sought 
jobs elsewhere in the biggest industrial dislocation of the decade 
for those who stayed the main industry became survival 
a survey sponsored last year by the united steelworkers of 
america showed 40 percent of the workers remain jobless those who 
found work take home 40 percent to 68 percent less than their steel 
wages 
to help allegheny county mental health created a program called 
bridge to recovery in 1986 it is run by lois brown 40 an 
exsteelworker whose father worked 40 years in a steel mill and 
whose grandfather worked in a tin mill her daughter works for usx 
for many of the people affected its too painful to think 
about this was a way of life almost from the beginning of time 
now theres nothing left its like it never existed mrs brown 
said 
still for many remaining usx workers the battle with icahn is 
worrisome although they have no love for usx and still smart from 
a sixmonth lockout four years ago the hard hats tend to align 
themselves with the company 
we know usx wed rather deal with the devil than the 
unknown said gary hubbard of the usw whose ranks have declined 
to 700000 half its alltime peak 
we are very much opposed to mergers and acquisitions for no 
other purpose than to saddle healthy companies with a huge debt 
burden he said the workers always pay the price 
the jitters are worst among those working at the remnants of 
steel valley 
the bombs are going to go off barney oursler of the mon 
valley unemployed committee said of the corporate haggling all 
they can hope for is they can duck so they dont get killed in the 
explosion

the stock market halted a weeklong decline with 
a modest advance today 
analysts said prices appeared to have fallen far enough in their 
recent slide to attract some buyers looking for bargains 
but they questioned how far a rally could go without signs of a 
significant easing in upward pressure on interest rates 
yields on government bonds which tend to influence the overall 
level of longterm interest rates have climbed lately to near 9 
percent the highest they have been in nearly a year 
that development has dampened hopes that corporate profits might

oil prices tumbled wednesday amid heavy selling 
motivated by technical market forces and speculation that sluggish 
demand will not soak up much of the supply glut 
some of the heaviest selling occured in the gasoline futures 
pits on the new york mercantile exchange 
the contract for may delivery of unleaded gasoline plunged 179 
cents to 6260 cents a gallon reversing course after several days 
of advances the contract had gained 085 cent on tuesday unleaded 
gasoline contracts for delivery further in the future also ended 
lower 
the contract for june delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude dropped 34 cents to 1866 a 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange after falling 
7 cents on tuesday contracts for later delivery also posted losses

june july and august contracts ended with steeper declines 
meanwhile natural gas for june delivery closed at 1552 per 
million british thermal units down from 1555 on tuesday 
analysts said the slide in unleaded gasoline prices appeared to 
be a correction after a recent runup they said there wasnt any 
fundamental supply or demand news on which to pin the selloff 
energy market analysts said prices generally remain under 
pressure from bearish supply estimates a weekly report released 
late tuesday after the market closed showed crude oil stocks rose 
12 million barrels last week adding to an already abundant 
inventory 
although the report from the american petroleum institute was 
unsurprising analysts said it reinforced the notion that supplies 
will significantly exceed expected demand in the near future

after weeks of fighting off hostile 
advances from a british conglomerate norton co said wednesday it 
had agreed to a 18 billion merger with a french firm 
news of nortons proposed 90ashare merger with compagnie 
saintgobain sent nortons stock sharply higher on the new york 
stock exchange 
nortons stock rose 1337 a share to 8862 and was the most 
active issue on the exchange with more than 45 million shares 
traded 
the offer tops the 16 billion 75ashare offer from btr plc 
the british company that had been pursuing norton 
btr responded to the proposed merger by announcing it is 
withdrawing its bid to put three people on nortons board of 
directors but is extending its offer to may 3 the extension is in 
case the nortonsaintgobain merger goes sour said a btr spokesman 
in new york city who declined to give his name 
essentially were pleased by it the higher bid the 
spokesman said were 49 percent shareholders of norton 
chairman john s nelson said norton decided to take the 
parisbased companys offer to avert a long and potentially bloody 
battle with btr 
given the increasing risk of the worst alternative for all 
constituencies fighting a war of attrition only to be bought in 
the end by btr for an inadequate price with no protection for 
employees and the worcester community we have concluded that a 
negotiated merger is the best alternative nelson said in a 
statement 
saintgobain is a real strategic partner for norton aside 
from the fact that its offered a premium price for the company it 
understands nortons businesses it believes in research and 
development said andrea priest a new yorkbased spokeswoman for 
norton 
analyst alvin donius of new yorkbased altman brenner wasserman 
agreed the two companies were a good match 
norton is a leading manufacturer of abrasives and engineering 
materials including advanced ceramics performance plastics and 
chemical process products it had 1989 sales of approximately 15 
billion employs 16000 people and operates 113 plants in the us 
and 25 other countries 
saintgobain produces a variety of flat glass fiber glass 
piping paper and wood products with annual sales of more than 11 
billion it employs 88000 people and operates 350 plants 
i think that its an ideal situation for norton and 
saintgobain donius said there is great synergy technology 
research and development manufacturing the whole nine yards 
although saintgobains offer was considerably higher than 
btrs donius said he believes the french firm can afford the 
expense 
the merger which requires tender of at least twothirds of 
nortons common shares before april 30 delighted norton employees 
who had banded together to fight the takeover after btrs offer in 
march employees held frequent rallies published a daily 
newsletter and lobbied for legislation to make the takeover more 
difficult 
after wednesdays announcement norton employees went out into 
the company parking lot for an impromptu rally to celebrate their 
apparent escape from btr who they were convinced would have 
decimated the worcester company 
the mood is great said tom morrison an organizer of a 
group formed by employees to fight btrs hostile takeover bid 
were really proud of what we did things are really good 
hopefully btrs going away and this company were setting up with 
seems to be a very good move he said 
the proposed merger announcement came a day after a federal 
judge ordered norton to reveal the amount of an offer the company 
said it received last week norton told the securities and exchange 
commission last friday that a third party was interested in buying 
norton for more money than btr 
the companys regular shareholders meeting is thursday 
conditions of the merger included keeping the norton name and 
leaving its headquarters and principal manufacturing operations in 
worcester the companies said employee policies and benefits would 
continue at present levels and norton would retain a separate board 
of directors 
saintgobain chairman jeanlouis beffa said he made the 
agreement to expand his companys us business interests and also 
because we did not want to see it norton dismembered or 
subjected to debt that would interfere with its strategic plans

he can strike fear deep into the hearts of the 
most financially acrobatic state and municipal treasurers because 
of his power to shape the bottom lines of their budgets 
hyman c grossman who evaluates their fiscal health for 
standard amp poors corp demonstrated that clout last month when he 
told new yorks budget makers he didnt like the states numbers 
the influential rating agency downgraded new yorks credit standing 
the move jolted new yorks byzantine budget process causing 
republicans and democrats alike to repent for years of effective 
deficit spending and work toward a true balanced budget 
the sudden conversion to the cause of fiscal probity didnt come 
cheap the rating move is expected to cost the states taxpayers 
180 million in higher debt interest payments over the next four 
years 
someone once called us a fourth branch of government 
grossman says its not a label he likes though he stresses that 
the agency tries to keep its distance from public officials to 
guarantee a dispassionate view of government finances 
were an important link in moving financing from the 
government to the ultimate investor really grossman says 
were kind of an umpire weve got to call it as we see it 
grossman constantly speaks in the plural voice emphasizing that 
he doesnt sit alone behind the plate the companys municipal 
department has 120 analysts and every major borrower is reviewed 
by a committee of at least five people 
a major rating change has to be pretty close to unanimous 
he says 
but as managing director of criteria and rating policy he sets 
the pace for the department he also chairs the rating committees 
for several key borrowers including new york state and city new 
jersey florida and texas 
grossman 55 has been making calls on state and local 
government finances for 27 years at sampp hes seen everything from 
the near bankruptcy of new york city in the mid1970s to the big 
state surpluses of the mid 80s to the shortfalls currently 
plaguing many state treasurers particularly in the northeast 
he says the pressures facing the states today are serious the 
federal government has cut back sharply on aid for social services 
transportation and water treatment 
at the same time sluggish economies have curbed the growth of 
income and sales tax revenues and corporate taxes arent picking 
up the slack 
the debtfinanced takeover boom of the 1980s has hurt state 
coffers by substituting taxdeductible debt for equity the record 
25 billion buyout of rjr nabisco for example probably will cost 
north carolina 100 million in lost income this year one quarter 
of its budget shortfall grossman says 
as new york state seeks to cope with a projected 15 billion 
shortfall grossman has suggested the state consider an income tax 
surcharge but he dismisses the idea that sampp tries to dictate 
policy 
were not necessarily advocates of higher taxes or lower taxes 
or more or less spending but we are advocates of credible and 
balanced financial operations he says 
theres a fine line between dictating specific policies and 
pushing for change though grossman was well aware of the 
political impact of a rating change when his team voted to 
downgrade new york after repeatedly expressing concern about the 
states accumulated deficits and a yawning budget gap for the 
latest fiscal year 
frankly if you express concern concern concern and you keep 
the rating you dont change policy and we felt that policy needed 
to be changed not that were dictating policy but the only way 
attention could be called to this credit deterioration was to 
change the rating 
the decision dropped the states rating by two notches to 
singlea the third lowest among the states after lowly louisiana 
and massachusetts telephoning state officials with the news was 
not easy but its part of our job grossman says 
budget director dall w forsythe said the state was surprised by 
the twonotch drop and that sampp didnt wait until legislators and 
the executive had agreed on a budget package 
we disagree on some of their judgments and decisions he 
said but he didnt challenge grossmans expertise he is a very 
knowledgeable professional he says 
rating governments is a natural for grossman who has a lifelong 
interest in public policy 
a new york city native grossman studied political science at 
new york university and became active in local democratic politics 
he spent one year in law school but left to marry in 1960 and earn 
a living on wall street 
he served as council president in his hometown of marlboro 
township in the new jersey suburbs from 1977 to 1981 the council 
agreed at the outset not to seek a rating from sampp if it borrowed 
during the period which it didnt 
as a member of the governmental accounting standards advisory 
council grossman is helping to revise accounting guidelines for 
public bodies across the country 
assessing the creditworthiness of a state or municipality is 
more complex and subjective than rating a corporation grossman 
says you cant just look at widget sales and debt payment 
schedules the rater has to judge the political process that 
produces the budget 
you develop a credibility assessment of the government youre 
dealing with grossman says in new yorks case years of 
papering over the deficit with oneshot financing deals wore 
credibility too thin he says 
grossman also emphasizes the strength or weakness of an areas 
underlying economy something forsythe says distinguishes sampp from 
its chief rival moodys investors service grossman doesnt like 
computer models though he relies on his nose for anecdotal 
evidence 
on a trip to austin texas for example he dropped into a real 
estate brokers office and was startled to find the office vacancy 
rate was 38 percent hardly a robust indicator 
two weeks before last christmas he took a lunchtime tour of a

the corporate parent of american 
airlines said wednesday it will spend 11 billion to expand 
passenger services and amenities in a bid to become the nations 
premiere international airline 
amr corp said it was embarking on the fiveyear plan that will 
include such luxuries as lobster chateaubriand and chocolate 
mousse served on special china and possibly even airborne fax 
machines despite a 193 million firstquarter loss reported last 
week 
we feel there is a place in the market for a premier united 
states international airline and our ambition is to be that to 
become known as the us flag carrier said george mueller vice 
president of customer services for amr based in fort worth 
the program will include the previously announced 77 billion 
investment in international aircraft amr said in simultaneous news 
conferences in arlington and chicago americans secondlargest hub 
after dallasfort worth an estimated 655 million is earmarked for 
terminal expansions amr said 
the new amenities will include almost fully reclining seats 
private video screens in first class sections and more spacious 
seating in business class none of the changes will be included on 
domestic flights but mueller said there will be no cuts in 
domestic service to finance the amenities on international flights 
the improvements will also include more upscale menus designed 
by culinary experts such as paul prudhomme 
amr hopes the moves will let american become a recognized 
international carrier and not just a mammoth domestic airline with 
a handful of overseas flights 
the airline has spent billions on planes ticketed for 
international routes and hundreds of millions to acquire routes to 
latin america and london it is aggressively seeking government 
approval for new routes to japan 
amrs announcement follows last weeks report that it lost 193 
million during the first three months of the year compared with a 
1567 million profit last year the loss of 31 cents per share 
came on a total operating revenue of 269 billion in the same 
period last year the company earned 160 per share on revenue of 
245 billion 
asked about amrs large planned outlay coming after the reported 
loss mueller said if you are going to go after and capture a 
market share in the international market youre not going to do 
that by cutting services 
analysts expect most airlines to report losses or a smaller 
profit than last year amrs loss was less than many industry 
analysts had expected

precious metal futures prices plunged wednesday as a 
supplyconnected collapse of platinum prices triggered selling in 
the gold and silver markets which had already been weakened by a 
lack of investor demand 
gold for spot delivery traded as low as 370 an ounce for the 
first time since april 2 and silver plummeted to its lowest level 
in nearly four years 
on other commodity markets copper futures surged to an 
eightmonth high oil futures were sharply lower grains and 
soybeans retreated and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 520 to 570 lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in april at 
37070 a troy ounce silver was 75 cents to 91 cents lower with 
april at 4919 the lowest settlement price for a nearmonth 
silver contract on the exchange since may 19 1986 
platinum futures finished 1560 lower across the board on the 
new york mercantile exchange with july at 47220 a troy ounce the 
lowest nearmonth platinum settlement since april 2 
the tumble extended tuesdays steep losses in gold and silver 
which analysts had attributed mainly to weak investor demand in the 
face of rising interest rates 
waves of selling swept easily through the thinlytraded platinum 
market early in the session amid signs of physical platinum sales 
by the japanese and an announcement by the worlds largest platinum 
producer of plans to increase production beginning in 1991 
analysts agreed the expansion plans by south africas rustenburg 
platinum co may have no effect on supplies of refined platinum for 
several years but because the company is such a large supplier 
its announcement really set us off said james steel a metals 
analyst with the futures brokerage refco inc 
some analysts also cited sluggish spring car sales inferring a 
corresponding drop in platinum demand for use in automobile 
catalytic converters 
analyst bette raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc 
discounted that notion noting that car makers buy platinum on an 
annual contract basis 
i really think it was a technical selloff and all these 
things were excuses she said 
some analysts pointed out though that supplies of silver 
certified as deliverable on the commodity exchange reported 
wednesday at 2545 million troy ounces are near record highs 
the exchange reported supplies of deliverable copper at about 
6000 tons on wednesday one day before the april contract is due 
to expire another exchange report indicated that more than 10000 
tons of copper would have been needed to satisfy all outstanding 
april contracts as of tuesday the last day for which statistics 
were available 
the apparent shortfall in deliverable supplies was the main 
factor behind wednesday dramatic surge in copper futures prices 
analysts said 
copper settled 11 cents to 10 cents higher with the april 
contract up 10 cents at 134 a pound the highest settlement of a 
nearmonth copper contract since aug 25 
crude oil and gasoline futures tumbled on the new york merc amid 
heavy selling motivated by technical market forces and speculation 
that sluggish demand will not soak up much of the supply glut 
a weekly report released tuesday by the american petroleum 
institute showed us crude oil stocks rose 12 million barrels 
last week adding to an already abundant inventory 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 34 cents 
lower with june at 1866 a barrel heating oil was 25 cent to 60 
cent lower with may at 5240 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
12 cents to 179 cents lower with may at 6260 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices advanced on the chicago board 
of trade led by a surging soybean market amid perceptions that the 
soviet union may be preparing to buy more us grain and soybean 
meal 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 3 cents higher with may at 
371 a bushel corn futures were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with 
may at 278 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with 
may at 158 a bushel soybeans were 10 cents to 13 cents higher 
with may at 609 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange live cattle futures settled 
02 cent to 22 cent lower with june at 7285 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 08 cent to 42 cent higher with april at 8427 cents a 
pound live hogs were unchanged to 70 cent higher with june at 
6252 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 08 cent to 60 cent 
lower with may at 6395 cents a pound

the northeasts continued manufacturing slump 
and a tight labor market are largely to blame for the regions 
anemic job growth in the past two years a labor report says 
the regions poor showing in a statebystate ranking of the 
number of new jobs created seven northeast states were in the 
bottom 10 follows an economic boom in the early 1980s for the 
northeast said a report by the new york regional bureau of labor 
statistics office 
the 1980s were a glorious period for the northeast but then 
they just ran out of steam regional commissioner samuel 
ehrenhalt said wednesday his report was released tuesday in 
albany ny 
before the last ranking which covered a twoyear period ending 
in december 1987 only one of the seven states pennsylvania had 
previously been in the bottom 10 of new jobs created 
the two northeast states to fare better than the bottom 10 were 
maine which was no 9 and vermont which was listed as no 31 
maine had previously been listed as no 10 for a ranking covering 
197987 while vermont was no 8 
overall the nine northeastern states accounted for 9 percent of 
the nations new jobs from 198789 compared to the 21 percent 
share from the early 1980s 
the report said that over the past two years the northeast 
continued on a 20year path of having the poorest factory record 
among the four regions 
but it also said that expansion has slowed since december 1987 
especially in such major growth sectors as services trade and 
finance construction has also weakened considerably the report 
said 
ehrenhalt said a slowdown in the population growth in the 
northeast and accompanying tight labor markets also were to blame 
for the regions slow job growth 
if youre not growing that many more customers you dont need 
that many more retail stores he said 
in contrast to the northeasts problems seven of the top 10 
states in job growth were in the west nevada which experienced a 
171 percent job growth came in at no 1 followed by idaho and 
then washington 
nationally job growth increased by 23 percent in 1989 
compared to the 32 percent in each of the previous two years 
here are the seven northeast states in the bottom 10 followed 
by job growth and then the previous ranking 
no 41 new jersey 32 percent no 16 
no 42 pennsylvania 29 percent no 41 
no 45 new york 19 percent no 27 
no 47 connecticut 07 percent no 19 
no 48 rhode island 03 percent no 25 
no 49 massachusetts 02 percent no 17

carl icahn said wednesday that if usx corp 
shareholders approve his proposal to spin off its steel business 
he would increase his usx stock holdings by 800 million and pledge 
not to seek control of the company 
icahn usxs largest stockholder with a 133 percent stake was 
apparently trying to counter suggestions that he has proposed the 
spinoff solely as a way to drive up the price of usx stock and then 
profit by selling his holdings 
we have no intention of selling if the vote goes in favor of a 
restructuring icahn said during a meeting with investors and 
analysts here 
if we win this vote the company will do something that 
should ultimately increase the value of usxs shares said icahn 
who is the chairman of trans world airlines and is a prominent 
takeover strategist 
shareholders are to vote on icahns nonbinding proposal at the 
companys annual meeting may 7 in findlay ohio home of usxs 
marathon oil co subsidiary 
under the plan which usx management opposes 80 percent of the 
companys us steel division would be spun off as a separate 
company with the proceeds of the sale distributed to usx 
shareholders 
icahn believing the company would be worth more to shareholders 
broken up said wednesday he would buy usx stock at a price up to 
48 the amount he believes shareholders would receive if his plan 
were carried out 
he said he would sign a standstill agreement under which he 
would not try to take over usx were not looking for control 
he said 
asked what he would do if he loses the vote icahn said he did 
not yet know well cross that bridge when we come to it he 
said 
however he said he was concerned about the future of usx if 
shareholders spurn his proposal saying the steel division needs an 
equity infusion that it is unlikely to receive while linked to the 
stronger marathon unit 
usx stock rose 125 to 34 a share in new york stock exchange 
composite trading wednesday 
it seems to me that icahn is simply trying to buy votes and 
distract stockholders from the serious questions that we and a 
number of prominent analysts have raised about his proposal to 
break up usx usx chairman charles corry said in a prepared 
statement 
icahns offer to buy some additional shares could seriously 
threaten the value of all outstanding usx shares the chairman said 
icahns announcement is totally conditional and subject to his 
sole discretion corry said it does not commit him to pay any 
particular price and is subject to a standstill agreement with usx 
that would have to be satisfactory to him 
icahn could obviously refuse to buy any shares saying the 
company was not willing to give him satisfactory terms for such a 
standstill agreement 
icahn said he believes a restructuring of usx would give 
stockholders 9 a share for their us steel holdings and 39 for 
their marathon holdings however he said wednesday there were many 
other steps besides his proposal that usx could take to restructure 
and raise its stock price 
he likened the situation at usx with that of texaco inc which 
restructured in 1989 after a series of battles with icahn 
including a takeover bid and his unsuccessful attempt to unseat the 
oil companys board 
if his usx proposal garnered 51 percent of the vote i think 
the company will do something relatively dramatic icahn said 
a number of people on the board are waiting for that kind of 
message 
skepticism over icahns motives follow a number of unsuccessful 
bids in the past including a 1987 run at usx many observers 
believed he sought the texaco restructuring which included the 
sale of billions of dollars in assets for his own financial gain

production of the chevrolet camaro and pontiac 
firebird will be moved to canada from southern california clearing 
the way for a new style of manufacturing at a general motors corp 
plant 
gm of canada ltd announced late wednesday that the next 
generation of the sports cars called fcars would be produced at 
its plant in ste therese quebec probably in late 1992 that will 
open up gms plant in van nuys calif where the cars are made 
currently for a new carmaking strategy 
there are about 3500 employees at the ste therese plant and 
about 3800 at van nuys 
sales of camaros and firebirds have been suffering this year 
like those of other gm cars through april 20 camaro sales were 
down 35 percent compared with last year and firebird sales were 
off 396 percent 
gm spokeswoman kathy tanner said wednesday in detroit that there 
was a proposal to make the van nuys plant gms first flex plant 
once production of the current fcar is ended 
it would be a facility capable of assembling a number of 
various models that would allow us to respond more quickly to the 
western market she said declining to elaborate 
partment to combat 
grasshoppers in the state of committee member sen quentin burdick 
dnd and in south dakota and minnesota 
in both its house and senate versions the bill was being 
largely financed through cuts or transfers from the pentagons 1990 
budget the senate bill claimed 28 billion in defense savings 1 
billion more than the house 
the bill also includes a provision aimed at solving the 
drawnout fight between the bush administration and congress over 
the pentagons ability to transfer funds to military personnel 
accounts to avoid massive layoffs bush had failed last year to 
exempt military personnel from the cuts imposed by a budgetcutting 
law 
the provision says 780 million of unspent funds from defense 
programs including the strategic defense initiative landbased 
missiles and bomber programs could be used to cover the shortfall 
in the personnel accounts 
when the pentagon earlier this year asked congress to let it 
transfer money to cover personnel costs house armed services 
committee chairman les aspin objected and criticized the 
administration for having put weapons before people

union carbide corp shareholders voted not 
to increase a 470 million settlement to victims of the 1984 bhopal 
gas leak despite hearing stories of the victims misery at 
wednesdays annual meeting 
one man in the hospital is totally paralyzed on one side and 
has great difficulty breathing said the rev andy smith a 
director of the american baptist churches usa who recently visited 
bhopal i also saw great anger against the corporation there and 
many women and children raised their fists in anger 
stockholders agreed with the companys directors and 
overwhelmingly defeated smiths proposal as well as a resolution 
to shut down a union carbide plant in south africa 
they were less sympathetic when it came to their pocketbooks 
grilling chairman robert d kennedy about carbides stock price 
dividends and plans to keep the company profitable during a 
downturn in the chemical industry 
we are as concerned as you are with the fact that our share 
price has gone down in recent months kennedy told shareholders 
he acknowledged the stock has traded below 20 a share this week 
down from 24 a year ago and 33 in february 1989 after the bhopal 
settlement was reached 
but he said he was optimistic the chemical and plastics maker 
will do well through the downturn saying its operations are the 
most efficient in the industry 
union carbide just reported a 53 percent drop in net earnings in 
the first three months of the year it attributed the decline to 
weaker prices and overcapacity as well as shutdowns at three 
chemical plants during a winter cold spell 
union carbide last year agreed to pay 470 million to compensate 
for the deadly leak of methyl isocyanate gas from its plant in 
bhopal india about 3600 people died in what was the worlds 
largest industrial accident 
i walked through the streets and spoke to many victims i was 
in their homes smith said what i found was appalling because 
the people are still suffering 
he said one doctor told him at least 50000 people had lung 
damage many cannot work because of breathing problems 
we believe that the 470 million is totally inadequate he 
told the meeting urging stockholders to pay for longterm medical 
care 
kennedy defended the settlement saying fewer victims have come 
forward than the government originally estimated he also said 
those who want more humanitarian aid should gripe to the indian 
government 
every single time that union carbide has attempted to act 
unilaterally with any kind of humane response we have been 
rebuffed he said they dont want our help they dont want us 
meddling in caring for their people 
the new indian government which took power earlier this year 
has asked that the settlement agreed to by its predecessor be set 
aside it says much more compensation should be paid 
at a press briefing later kennedy acknowledged it will take 
time for the bhopal disaster to fade 
i think we will never put bhopal behind us fully but i also 
believe you regain your image one day at a time one year at a 
time by what you do and the record you achieve he said 
kennedy encouraged one speaker to provide the company with 
independent test results indicating soil and drinking water near 
the bhopal plant still contain toxic materials marco kaltofen 
scientific director of the national toxics campaign in boston had 
asked the company for a schedule for cleaning up the toxics 
kennedy also told stockholders union carbide was reducing 
emissions and improving standards for handling toxic wastes and 
materials at its facilities he said the company has signed on to a 
set of industry standards that aim to cut emissions spills leaks 
and hazardous materials

ralph ingersoll ii hasnt been having a very 
good spring 
on wednesday the bold and gracious 43yearold newspaper 
publisher announced that his new headlinegrabbing project the 
st louis sun was folding after only seven months of publication 
five days earlier an effort to clear away much of his junkbond

ingersoll editorinchief of the sun and chairman and chief 
executive officer of princeton njbased ingersoll publications 
co stressed on wednesday that the troubles are not related

ingersoll said at wednesdays unexpected news conference to 
announce the end of the sun 
but even though his problems have intensified lately ingersoll 
the son of a respected newspaper editor has remained cool and 
upbeat 
in an april 12 interview while the sun apparently was hitting a 
low point ingersoll said the paper had plenty of good news as well 
as some problems the changes are all evolutionary not 
revolutionary he said then 
when he launched the sun last september he said he wanted to 
prove that new newspapers if properly designed and promoted could 
be introduced in the united states just as they had been in other

he said he was planning to move to st louis and would 
personally direct the rise of the sun he spent many late nights in 
the newspapers hightech newsroom learning about sophisticated 
equipment and refining the look of the sun 
im disappointed i feel that we gave it our very best shot 
ingersoll said wednesday 
with the setting of the sun ingersoll can turn his attention to 
trying to negotiate a deal to buy back up to 1586 million of the 
240 million of junkbond debt at community newspapers inc an 
ingersoll publications subsidiary 
the company went on an expansion spree with proceeds from junk 
bond issues but the junk market has collapsed in recent months and 
the bonds have been selling at about 40 cents on the dollar 
that has put the company in a bind because it is required in 
june to reset the terms on its 125 million of 13 percent bonds so 
that the securities trade at 101 cents on the dollar judging by 
current market conditions that would require a staggering new 
interest rate of more than 26 percent 
ingersoll offered to buy back up to 80 percent of the issue for 
55 cents on the dollar he also offered to pay 25 cents on the 
dollar for 51 percent of the companys 1149 million in 14 percent 
bonds which arent due to be reset until next year 
ingersoll has extended his offer to buy the bonds until may 4 
and on wednesday he said he was considering upping his offer to 
bondholders but he wouldnt say how much 
i dont do my negotiating in public he said

mesa limited partnership the energy company 
headed by t boone pickens said it lost 1824 million in the 
first quarter and would suspend cash distributions to preferred 
unitholders until natural gas prices increase 
the decision which takes affect after the first quarter 
payment comes four months after mesa stopped paying common 
unitholders because of low natural gas prices distributions to 
unitholders in a partnership are akin to dividends paid to 
stockholders of a corporation

significant improvement in prices this past winter pickens said 
in explaining the decision 
we expect prices this summer to be about equal with those 
received in 1989 he said the partnership will continue to 
report losses until gas prices increase

quarter was 190 per million british thermal units on wednesday

in the quarter ended march 31 compared with a profit of 1461 
million or 15 cents per unit a year earlier revenues slumped to 
965 million from 105 million 
mesa last year reduced its quarterly payout to both common and 
preferred unitholders to 375 cents a unit from 50 cents mesa met 
the payments with proceeds from stock investments and not its 
energy operations but even those earnings have slumped 
earnings from marketable securities plummetted to 375 million 
in the latest quarter from 419 million in the first quarter of

the united states and japan reached agreement 
wednesday to expand sales of american wood products as the bush 
administration hinted that japans actions will keep it off a hit 
list of countries with the most offensive trade barriers 
the agreement wrapped up the final outstanding case cited by the 
bush administration a year ago when it targeted tokyo for priority 
marketopening negotiations 
us trade representative carla hills announcing the successful 
conclusion of the talks said the agreement which lowers tariffs 
and revises japanese building code standards should result in a 1 
billion increase in american export sales while providing 
lowercost and higherquality wood housing to japanese 
consumers 
the administration a year ago targeted japan for its barriers to 
sales of american wood products satellites and supercomputers 
all three issues have been settled in the last five weeks after 
months of talks with little progress 
the government of japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu has 
pushed to lower trade tensions between the two economic superpowers 
since president bush and kaifu held a recent trade summit in 
california 
the bush administration faces a monday deadline for deciding 
whether to target japan in a second round of marketopening 
negotiations under a tough section of the 1988 trade law known as 
super 301 
various american industry groups and members of congress argue 
that the administration must cite japan again to keep pressure on a 
country that accounts for nearly half of americas overall trade 
deficit 
but hills while saying the administration has not made its 
final decision strongly indicated that she opposed targeting japan 
again 
she said that in a review of 33 japanese trade barriers she 
could find none that could best be resolved through use of the 
super 301 process that provision provides for retaliatory 
sanctions if the barriers arent removed within a specified period 
of time 
she told the committee that the flurry of concessions made by 
japan in the past month indicated that kaifus government seriously 
intended to resolve trade frictions 
however various senators said tokyos record in honoring past 
agreements was weak and that there was no evidence the latest round 
of commitments would make a dent in americas 49 billion deficit 
with japan 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
the administration would be making a serious mistake if it failed 
to target japan under super 301 which he called the cornerstone of 
the 1988 trade law 
he and sen john danforth rmo both held out the threat that 
congress would block approval of pending trade agreements with 
eastern european countries the soviet union and china if the 
administration failed to target japan 
if the administration ignores a trade law that congress has 
constitutionally enacted i am concerned it may poison the well for 
the consideration of those agreements bentsen told hills 
however hills asked the committee to give her more leeway in 
choosing the best way to gain market access with japan 
i need a little of your confidence and just a little longer 
tether she said 
bush and the economic policy group of his cabinet were scheduled 
to hear thursday from hills on the super 301 designation with 
indications that an announcement on the issue could come late 
thursday or friday 
last year the administration cited japan brazil and india for 
the priority negotiations hills said that the discussions with 
japan and brazil had been successful but that no progress had been 
made in talks with india concerning foreign investment and 
insurance 
some in the administration have argued that no country should be 
cited this year but sen john heinz rpa said such a decision 
would send a dangerous and inaccurate message that america is 
not concerned about unfair barriers 
sen don riegle dmich warned hills that he would push for 
legislation to extend the requirement for the administration to 
target countries which was due to expire this year 
if a foreign country thinks they can slide by this year with 
talk and talk we are going to come back and tighten up the law 
riegle said 
however sens bob packwood roregon and daniel patrick 
moynihan dny both said that they feared that targeting japan 
after it had met us demands would be wrong

securities co said many investors were reluctant to buy issues 
ahead of the golden week holidays that start saturday and go 
through may 6 for many japanese companies 
they are trying to stay on the safer side especially due to 
uncertainties over foreign exchange fluctuations he said 
in currency dealings the dollars strength followed its 
overnight upswing in new york dealers said 
the dollar gained ground as market players bought the west 
german mark against the yen which indirectly helped weaken the yen 
against the dollar said toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst 
with new japan securities co buying and selling was evenly matched 
when the dollar crossed the 159yen level he added 
trading was thin ahead of the golden week holidays kanai 
said 
masaaki tanahashi a dealer with mitsui taiyo kobe bank said 
holidays that shut markets in australia and new zealand wednesday 
kept trading very light
